      "description": "Step inside the dark, sinister and complex world of cults and sects, where the power of one can lead to the ultimate control of many. Through survivor stories and first-hand testimony, this documentary reveals how the \u2018desire to belong\u2019 can collide with the abuse of power, leading to dangerous and life-changing situations. Most \u2018victims\u2019 are seemingly ordinary people who become trapped in an organisation intent on destroying their belief system. But how do cults and sects start? What makes people join? And when do people realise they need to get out? Featuring survivors of The Children of God, The O and The Exclusive Brethren.\n\nDocumentary Central is the home for compelling documentaries tackling subjects like history,  climate change, wildlife, conspiracy and more.
