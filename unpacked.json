      "description": "In Jerusalem\u2019s alleys and Brooklyn\u2019s streets, they\u2019re seen as relics of the past \u2014 black hats, long coats, and a life that looks untouched by time. But the Hasidic world didn\u2019t emerge from tradition. It rose from revolution.\n\nIn 18th-century Ukraine, amid violence and despair, a mystical rebellion upended the rabbinic elite with joy, dance, and devotion. Preaching spirit over scholarship, Hasidic Jews were mocked, exiled, even jailed. But they endured \u2014 and reshaped Judaism as it\u2019s known today, from the margins.\n\nAnd today, their descendants are still dancing.\n\nChapters\n00:00 Intro\n00:44 Origins of Hasidism\n04:40 The Baal Shem Tov\n06:59 Alternative avenues to God\n09:16 Female leadership in Hasidism\n10:40 The Misnagdim\n12:51 The memory of Shabbatai Zevi\n14:14 Excommunication, book burnings, \u0026 reporting to authorities\n17:21 The Haskalah: The Jewish Enlightenment\n19:48 Post-H0l0caust Hasidic \u0026 Litvish counterculture\n\nSources:\n-Wodzi\u0144ski, Marcin.

Diving into anything and everything related to Jewish culture, history, and even religion. \nUnderstand Jewish holidays, Israeli politics, Jewish diasporic communities, and more. Learn about Judaism in pop culture, debunking myths about Jews, and explore obscure Israeli landmarks.  We\u2019re asking questions as basic as \u201CWhat is the Talmud?\u201D, and as obscure as \u201CHow did hip-hop boost Kosher wine sales?\u201D, and everything in between.\n\nAbout Unpacked: We provide nuanced insights by unpacking all things Jewish. People are complex and complicated \u2014 yet we\u2019re constantly being pushed to oversimplify our world. At Unpacked we know that being complex makes us more interesting. Because of this, we break the world down with nuance and insight to drive your curiosity and challenge your thinking.\n\n#history #people #revolution",
