      "description": "This month a musical featuring a Scamfluencers alum closed its doors on Broadway. Tammy Faye featured music by Elton John and told the story of a televangelist who stole America\u2019s heart with her humor, earnestness, and impressive eye makeup. You may no longer be able to see the musical, but we\u2019re giving you the next best thing: a return to our own coverage of Tammy Faye and her husband, Jim. Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker get their start in Christian broadcasting in the early 1960s and quickly become television superstars. As their fame explodes, they build an empire complete with their own network, a theme park, and a super-sized luxury lifestyle for themselves. But when their spending \u2013 and their scandals \u2013 get out of control, they\u2019ll face their own judgment day. This episode contains descriptions of sexual assault. If you or someone you know is a survivor looking for resources, call the U.S. National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-H-O-P-E.

      "description": "Fueled by cocaine and daddy issues, Richard Bandler revolutionized self-help by developing an approach called Neuro-Linguistic Programming \u2014 which is essentially mental manipulation. Richard got his start in the 1970s, and his books and controversial workshops gained thousands of followers and made him rich. But his addictions isolated him from his friends and family, and led him to get caught up in a gruesome crime. Richard may not have practiced what he taught, but NLP has inspired many, including some truly toxic and criminal movements.
