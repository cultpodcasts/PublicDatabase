      "title": "56: A Calling To End Trafficking with Brittany Dunn",
      "description": "A friend\u2019s kitchen-table Bible study turned into a national movement. Brittany Dunn joins us to share how Safe House Project is confronting child trafficking in America with a strategy built on training, survivor support, and evidence-based safe house certification\u2014and why proximity, not sensational headlines, should reshape how we see this crisis. The numbers are sobering, but the path forward is clear, practical, and hopeful.\n\nWe talk through the real shockers\u2014like how many victims are first trafficked by family members\u2014and the tools anyone can use to help, including the Simply Report app for learning and reporting, and On-Watch training designed for short, focused learning. Brittany opens up about excellence as stewardship: transparent finances, measurable outcomes, and programs that stand up to scrutiny. Her leadership philosophy is simple and demanding\u2014excellence without perfection, compassion without naivety, and prayer before plans.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever felt torn between meaningful work and being present at home, you\u2019ll find a blueprint here. Brittany rejects the myth of balance and leans into managing energy and seasons, setting clear expectations at work and with her kids, and integrating family into mission so purpose becomes shared, not siloed. She also shares the spiritual rhythms that hold everything together: a 5:30 a.m. prayer call, Scripture, the \u201Cfull armor\u201D mindset, and physical training to metabolize stress and stay grounded.\n\nReady to engage?
