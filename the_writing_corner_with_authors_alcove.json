      "description": "In this author interview with book coach Sally Lotz, we discuss writing and overcoming hurtles in our Experts on Writing series. Sally Lotz, author of the gripping novel \u0027The Truth is a Lie.\u0027 Inspired by her own experiences growing up in the Jehovah\u0027s Witness cult, Sally\u2019s book tells the story of Sara, a young girl whose faith is shattered when she uncovers a dark secret. Sally shares her journey of escaping the cult at sixteen, the challenges of transforming real-life events into fiction, and the powerful themes that run through her book. Additionally, Sally provides valuable insights into her writing process, overcoming hurdles, and the importance of journaling. As a writing coach and mentor, she also offers advice for aspiring authors. Join us for an engaging and heartfelt conversation about resilience, truth, and the transformative power of writing. ------------------------------------ SHOW ME LOVE OVER AT PATREON - https://patreon.com/authorsalcovepodcast?utm_medium=unknown\u0026utm_source=join_link\u0026utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator\u0026utm_content=copyLink BUY THE WRITING PROGRAM SCRIVENER - $60!
