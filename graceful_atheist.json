      "description": "This week\u2019s guest is Amanda. Amanda comes from a rather surprising brand of Christianity she refers to as the \u201CSerpent Seed Pentecostal Cult.\u201D She goes into detail, and it\u2019s quite a ride.  Various things happened throughout her adolescence that made her wonder if Christianity was true, but her mother would violently put a quick stop to those doubts. By 17, Amanda left home to live with a friend, but that couldn\u2019t last long.  Amanda spent a decade trying out every religion under the sun but never found the one that could give real, solid answers.  \u201CEverybody thinks that they have the answer but nobody does.\u201D  Today, she knows she doesn\u2019t need the gods to dictate her life. She\u2019s living it to the fullest and always moving forward.
