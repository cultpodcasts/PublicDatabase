      "description": "On November 18, 1978, Jim Jones orchestrated the Jonestown massacre, the name given to the mass murder carried out by the preacher and leader of a religious community in the heart of the Guyanese jungle.\n\nMedia outlets worldwide narrated, horrified, what the Guyanese authorities had discovered in the settlement of the long-considered dark cult. The members of the People\u0027s Temple, the cult led by Jim Jones, had just committed the largest mass suicide in modern history. 909 people were found dead.\n\nThe grim outcome for a community that, at the time when journalist Marshall Kilduff published an article exposing the dark truth about the sect based in San Francisco, was forced to embark on an exodus to what Jim Jones referred to as \u0022The Promised Land.\u0022 However, when Congressman Leo Ryan led an expedition to that place to rescue American citizens, the tragedy unfolded.\n\nThis is the story behind the People\u0027s Temple. A journey into the mind of Jim Jones to understand, through the audio tapes found in his empire, how the gates of hell opened in Jonestown.\n\n\uD83D\uDCB8\uD83D\uDCB8\uD83D\uDCB8 Ways of supporting the content:\n\n\uD83C\uDD7F | PayPal: paypal.me/polbertran96\n\uD83D\uDFE0 | Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/polbertran\n\nCHAPTERS:\n\n00:00 - A-side: \u0022Them\u0022\n22:21 - B-side: \u0022Us\u0022",
