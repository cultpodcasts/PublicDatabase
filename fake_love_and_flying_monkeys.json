      "description": "The Narcissist is like a Cult Leader In this episode we take a deep dive into the striking parallels between narcissists and cult leaders. Narcissists, much like cult leaders, create an environment where they exert extreme control, manipulating their victims into loyalty and compliance. We\u2019ll explore how narcissists use charm, fear, and manipulation to isolate their targets, breaking down their sense of self-worth to gain complete control. We also discuss how narcissists slowly build a \u201Cfollowing,\u201D surrounding themselves with enablers and flying monkeys to maintain their power. By examining these similarities, we\u2019ll uncover why narcissists thrive in these power dynamics, using psychological manipulation to draw people in and keep them under their influence.
