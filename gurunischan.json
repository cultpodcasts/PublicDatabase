      "description": "Rosalinde Heiml was born in 1963 in southern Germany. At 20, she moved to Italy to work. In 1985, at 22, she met Guru Meher Singh, the ashram leader in Rome, to become his yoga student.\n\nIn February 1986, Yogi Bhajan visited Rome and ordered her to come to the U.S. Despite her very limited English, and internal hesitation, she quit her job and left L.A. After two weeks in Los Angeles, she left for Ram Dass Puri and joined the Ladies\u0027 camp in New Mexico.\n\nBack in Rome, she traveled with Guru Meher and his brother\u2019s family to the European Yoga Festival in Loches, France. Afterwards, they got married and her name was changed to Guru Meher Kaur. As the ashram director\u2019s wife in Rome, she was expected to embody the perfect Sikh woman, so in 1989, her husband sent her to the Hamburg Germany Ashram to be trained by Tarn Taran Kaur.\n\nJust two years after the birth of her son they abruptly left 3HO in 1993. Guru Meher Singh continued to teach a KY hybrid style of yoga in Italy, and became a sort of \u0022Family Guru\u201D. She gave birth to her daughter in 1995 and nine years later in 2011, she finally divorced. With professional support from trauma therapists affiliated with anti-violence centers in Munich and Venice, she began her journey toward freedom and self-discovery..\n\nIn June 2024, after reading Under the Yoga Mat, she contacted Els Coenen and started sharing her story of abuse. This helped her prepare for this interview.\n\nRosalinde is currently involved in legal cases to regain her freedom and achieve peace. These days, she rents out a studio to tourists in Venice, which brings her great satisfaction. She hopes to keep pursuing her passions, especially arts and design, and maybe write a book.\n\nSong: Joan Baez Donna Donna\n\nSpotify Playlist: Uncomfortable Conversations 3HO Playlist: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2lEfcoaDgbCCmztPZ4XIuN?si=vH-cH7HzRs-qFxzEuogOqg\u0026nd=1\u0026dlsi=7d2acdf956554172\n\nResources mentioned in this episode:\nConversations You Can Feel: www.gurunischan.substack.com\n\nhttps://abuse-in-kundalini-yoga.com/\n\nBook: Under the Yoga Mat: The Dark History of Kundalini Yoga\n\nBook: The Cultish Nature of Kundalini Yoga\n\nThe Banality of Evil: Hannah Arendt and the Final Solution\n\nThe Lost Bread by Edith Bruck\n\nPalestinian solidarity and resource links:\nhttps://bdsmovement.net/campaigns\n\nhttps://electronicintifada.net/\n\nThe Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine by Illan Pappe\n\nThe Hundred Years\u2019 War on Palestine by Rashid Khalidi\n\n@eyeonpalestine\n\nhttps://sumudpod.com/\n\nPlease Contribute to this publication by making a one time or monthly contribution.\n\nGive a gift subscription\n\nDon\u2019t miss another episode by SUBSCRIBING to Conversations You Can Feel Podcasts \u0026 Publishings.

He was even a IKYTA Mexico board member until 2018\u00A0 when he began to disconnect from his local sangat community because of incongruency. In 2020 when the book Premka came out he began to confront the dark side of KY for real.\u00A0 After the Beyond the Cage FB group, reading the AOB report, listening to the UCpodcast, and all the material that became available, Rodolfo began deprogramming and figuring out his own practice, totally removing himself from KY Cult.\u00A0He\u2019s a Bodyworker and massage therapist and Spa owner of Canto Yoga \u0026 Spa in Guadalajara M\u00E9xico.

He\u2019s the Co-Creator of the youtube channel for the continuity of conversations in spanish, for uncomfortable conversations podcast. \nIvan Sanchez (Siri Om Singh) was in the KY Cult from 2006-2021. He was a kundalini instructor for 11 years, taking his first teacher Training by 2009. His mentors were Tarn Taran Kaur (USA), Shiv Charan Singh (PORTUGAL) and Gurujodha Singh (Mexico) at RaMa Kundalini Yoga school in Mexico City. As an instructor he achieved level II certification in his training as a Kundalini Yoga teacher. He was a member of ATA (Aquarian Teachers Academy) training as a leading trainer to teach courses and training for future teachers. In 2020 he discovered the book White Bird in a Golden Cage by Premka and also came across the book Trust All For Nothing, my time saving Yogi Bhajan by Wahe Guru Kaur and seeing himself reflected in many of the statements of physical and psychological abuse that he finds in these documents, he decides to investigate and realizes that there are thousands of people around the world raising their voices and talking about abuse within the so-called Kundalini Yoga community led by 3HO and KRI.\nNot finding support or coherence in many colleagues, students and teachers in Mexico at that time, he makes the decision to renounce his titles, his classes, his lifestyle and the community. From that moment on, he uses social networks to make complaints and support people who are realizing the manipulation that exists in the \u0022white sect\u0022 as he usually calls it. Ivan has been attacked by people who consider that he is harming the community and the teachings of Yogi Bhajan, however that does not stop him from continuing to raise his voice and helping more and more people to realize the deceptions and manipulation into which they can fall by the misnamed Kundalini Yoga community.\nCurrently, after a process of therapy and with the help of his partner and great friends, he\u2019s managed to heal many emotional wounds. He decided to continue raising his voice, because after 4 years, the current Kundalini Yoga teachers continue to give classes and hold teacher training sessions as if nothing had happened, and that seems extremely dangerous to me for people who are looking for something to feel better about themselves. For this reason, he has partnered w/ Els Coenen and Rodolfo to share information in Spanish in Mexico and Latin America since a lot of guidance is needed due to the language difference with regions such as the United States or Europe.\nUC Podcast Episode 48: Siri Om Singh; Mexico City, Mexico (Started KY 2006 - 2021)\nBook link to Under the Yoga Mat: The Dark History of Yogi Bhajan\u0027s Kundalini Yoga \nAbuse in Kundalini Yoga Website \nGuruNischan is a writer, pleasure activist, and consultant in personal reinvention for unorthodox high achievers.

      "description": "Manju Sadarangani was born and raised in India, surrounded by yoga. Her yoga teacher mother insisted on an upbringing informed by yoga and traditional medicine. In her teen years, her deeply spiritual brilliant father joined a Hindu cult, resulting in upheaval resulting in her immigration to the United States with her mother and brother. Manju found yoga in the US to be deeply puzzling. She would try yoga studios and styles of yoga in an effort to feel the spiritual solace of her childhood yoga practice, but felt extremely excluded at American yoga studios. Through most of her adult life, she avoided yoga, and practiced it only when she visited the country of her birth. In 2019, serendipity led her to a kundalini yoga class. She was intrigued by this unfamiliar style of yoga which she found absurd and amusing, but was soothed by the elements of Surat Shabd that she recognized in kundalini yoga practice. She enjoyed the element of play and creativity in her kundalini meditations, but found herself often flummoxed by the pastiche mantras and practices. She was offended by some practices (like excerpts of Japji inserted into kriyas) - but when she asked questions of kundalini teachers, they were not able to give her answers that felt logical or grounded in any yoga discipline. Her teachers encouraged her to take teacher training with KRI, telling her that was where she would get answers. Manju was understandably reluctant, especially after she read the book Premka. In 2020, she was approached by representatives of KRI, who recommended a brand-new global teacher training program. This new TT was advertised as trauma-informed, inclusive, egalitarian - a symbol of the new direction KRI and 3HO were embracing. Manju applied to this new teacher training global cohort. She was one of only three Americans, all women of color. It turned out to be one of the most traumatic and racist experiences of her life. Since then, Manju has relied on her command of languages, academic background in South Asian history, conversations with elders and teachers in India, and cultural background to deeply research, question, retrain, and reform her yoga practice. She connects deeply with the feminist, spiritual and historical foundations of yoga to counter problematic cultural appropriation. Her evolving yoga practice is grounded in a desire for equity, justice, emotional and mental well-being. She brings her spirit of play, body positivity and radical self-love to her yoga practice, acknowledging that her yoga journey makes her an inconvenient outsider the art of manju manjusadarangani.com Song credit: Vaishnav Janto Tene Kahiye by M.S.

      "description": "Mel Hofmann, at the time was Melanie Calhoon started studying Kundalini yoga classes in 1970, at the age of 15 in Berkeley, CA . The local area ashram at the time was known as the \u201CBanana Ananda\u201D ashram in San Rafael, CA. She moved into the ashram in the Fall of 1971 at the age of 16 years old. Shortly thereafter, the name of the ashram was changed to Hargobind Sadan. Baba Bert, later named Sat Santokh Singh was the head of the ashram. She lived in the ashram until June of 1972, when her roommate, Jeannie, who later became known as GuruTarethKaur (Jivan Jhoti Kaur) was arranged to be married Robert Zwaag (also known as, GuruTarethSingh). The abrupt marriages, name changes and overall shift in the \u201Clifestyle\u201D led Mel to pursue her own path soon after. She\u0027s was married to Stephen Hofmann and had a daughter who is currently 32 years old. He had cerebral palsy and is featured with our daughter Emily in the documentary, Crip Camp.

      "description": "Siri Whitecrow, was born Elias Seneca Whitecrow in 1972 in Juneau, Alaska. His mom, Sat guru Kaur, joined 3HO with his older sister, Siri Kaur, in 1976 and his name was changed to Siri Singh Khalsa. His early life was spent between two different ashrams in Anchorage, Alaska, then in 1979 he was sent to Espa\u00F1ola New Mexico at 7 years old, living with two different families. In 1981 he was sent to the newly (not yet) established India program GNFC, initially being sent to the girls school because he was so young and only in 3rd grade. After four years in India, and tons of horrific abuse, and plenty of righteous resistance, he was kicked out of that school and sent back to the USA. He spent half a year at Amritsar Academy in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he was eventually asked to \u201Cnot return\u201D. He ended up in Los Angeles, near his mom and close to the ashram, but by 1988 he left 3HO/Sikh Dharma/Kundalini Yoga completely, never looking back. Graffiti became a huge part of his life and currently still is. His Graffiti name is ANGER and he runs one of the biggest graffiti crews in the world which began in 1993 when his life was forever altered when his mentor was hit by a train, and he was shot 4X by a Los Angeles police officer. He currently lives in Los Angeles, is married with two boys and continues to navigate his life through art, and creativity.

      "description": "Guruganesha Singh grew up in Natick MA, 18 miles west of Boston. Graduated high school class of 1968. In Feb 1972, he attended his first KY class at the boathouse at Smith College in Northampton MA, after seeing YB\u0027s tratakum pic on a flyer in the Student Union. Soon after he attended a weekend KY retreat at the Montague (montagew) in MA with Guru Shabd Singh. Very soon thereafter he moved into the Worcester (wooster)MA Ashram near Clark University where he was a senior year in college. The first week of Jan. 1973 he moved into Ahimsa Ashram on Q St. Washington DC, where he became the dishwasher at the Golden Temple Restaurant for many months. He was arranged to be married to Gurudarshan Kaur originally from Tuscon, AZ in May 1977. They had their son, Akal Sahai Singh in April 1978. In 1986, at age 8 years old, their son, Akal Sahai went to India for one year, which caused a rupture in their marriage, and Gurudarshan started divorce proceedings. In 1987 it was suggested by the head of the ashram that he marry Mata Mandir Kaur from the DC ashram (and they are still married 36 years later) He worked for all the DC ashram businesses thru 1989 when he resigned from the \u201Cfamily\u201D businesses and started his own business Sandler Sales Institute, a sales training in the high-tech sector. In Jan 2000 he founded Spirit Voyage Music and started recording and touring with Snatam Kaur for the next 11 years. In 2011 he and Snatam parted ways, and he started the GuruGanesha Band. The revelations of 2020 exposed what he held at a distance for far too long, and the undeniable truth created a landslide. Most recently, after the results of the 2023 Siri Singh Sahib Corporation (SSSC) elections, he immediately resigned from Khalsa Council and the Sikh Dharma Ministry.

      "description": "Ravi Singh began practicing Kundalini Yoga in 1973 and lived in the 3HO ashram in Chicago, IL. In 1974 he moved to New York City to be a writer and continued to practice Kundalini Yoga and began teaching. In the late 70\u0027s I had a brief stint as a resident of the 3HO ashram in Brooklyn, NY. He attended every Summer and Winter Solstice gathering from 1976 to 2000 and before 1999 would typically teach Kundalini Yoga at those events. In 1999 he discovered that YB had propositioned one of my students at Women\u0027s Camp. That was when the floodgates opened and the scope of what was going on behind the scenes became abundantly clear. When he attempted to alert people he was summarily kicked out of 3HO. His state of mind since then has been one of personal liberation, i.e., relief that he doesn\u2019t have to continue to try to be someone he\u2019s not. It became more obvious over time that there\u0027s no room in an organization like 3HO for artists, autonomous beings, or independent thinkers. Ravi Singh is Author (with partner Ana Brett) of the Kundalini Yoga Book - Life in the Vast Lane. He\u0027s been teaching yoga for 45 yrs. He is Founder of Evolving Kundalini, which was created via the need for a safe space for Kundalini Yoga Teachers to gather and process. EK is now a non-profit dedicated to ethics in yoga, and the forward evolution and the up-leveling of all things Kundalini.

      "description": "Els Coenen (formerly Ravinder Kaur) lives in Belgium. She was 49 when she took her first Kundalini Yoga class, immediately fell in love with it and became a teacher in 2008. She taught Kundalini Yoga for ten years, gave multiple classes a week, organized workshops and teacher training programs in Belgium and East-Africa and assisted in them. Every year she went to the European Yoga Festival, had a boot at the bazar to collect funds for the seva-based teacher training programs in East-Africa, combining this work with a job in the Telecom sector. She organized a Sat Nam Rasayan training in Belgium. In 2013, two women were sexually abused by an SNR instructor. Because Els insisted that the harm would be recognized, and action would be taken to prevent future abuse, she was excommunicated by Guru Dev Singh master of this healing technique and student of Yogi Bhajan, and Belgium was declared \u0022a no-go-zone\u0022 for SNR for two years. From 2010 till 2018 Els presided the Belgian Federation of Kundalini Yoga and represented her country at an international level. Disillusioned by many things she stopped all Kundalini Yoga related activities in 2018. When in 2020 the book Premka triggered many survivors to tell their stories, Els stepped in again, hoping that the time for transparency and clarity had come. She was part of an advisory team of the Compassionate Reconciliation Program but stepped out at the end of 2022 as she experienced it as window dressing. In April 2021 after she read or listened to survivor stories on many different platforms and had watched hours and hours of Uncomfortable Conversations, she contacted GuruNischan to collaborate. She made extracts of the interviews and put them together on a website (abuse-in-kundalini-yoga.com) to allow people with less free time to be informed. Now, she has written a book in partnership with GuruNischan, including voices of survivor stories called Under the Yoga Mat: The Dark History of Yogi Bhajan\u2019s Kundalini Yoga.

      "description": "Guru Kartar Kaur (she now goes by Rue) was born into 3HO in Mexico City in 1997 to her parents, Guru Hans Kaur Khalsa and Siri Simran Singh. A couple months after she was born, Rue and her sister, Partmatma Kaur, were brought to New Mexico by her parents, to attend the Summer Solstice where she met YB and received her spiritual name from him. Rue\u2019s parents were originally raised catholic but later converted to Sikhism and joined the 3HO community through her maternal grandmother, Hari Kaur Khalsa, who first became a member of Babaji\u2019s Ashram; the first 3HO Ashram in Mexico City in 1972. Rue participated in Summer Solstice with her family for 7 years straight. At age 11, her parents decided to send her to MPA so that she could practice and learn more about the Sikh religion. Her older sister was first sent away in 2007 and then Rue joined her a year after. They lived in India for 3 years straight and later returned back to Mexico as their parents no longer found the school appropriate and affordable. Rue has now been living in Ontario, Canada for 11 years. She is currently in the works of opening her own art business and will soon be attending college for social service work. Through her own self-healing journey and research, she discovered she has dealt with racism and sexism as a Latina with indigenous ancestry, especially while being part of a religious cult at a young age.

GuruNischan.com ____________________ From Eps. 55: Darci Larocque, was born Darci Clack in 1971. Her father joined 3HO in 1974 in the New Haven Ashram. Her mom and father were divorced and at the age of 5, she started visiting the ashram in Dorchester, MA, where her father had moved. One day in first grade catholic school, her dad and a friend in full Bana showed up in the middle of a school day and took her. Darci was taken to the Dorchester ashram and even though her mom had full custody, her father wouldn\u2019t give her back. It was the 1970s - her mom, then 23 year old could not fight it so she joined 3HO and moved in. Darci\u2019s dad was Deva Singh. Her mom was Ram Sarn Kaur and her name became Upma. After Children\u2019s Camp in 1978, at 7 years old she was sent to the newly created Guardian Program in New Mexico where she stayed for years; first with one set of guardians then with the heads of the ashram. Which among other things, she had direct ranch access that only in hindsight she can now see as \u201Cspecial\u201D. During this time, her mom moved to the LA ashram and YB engaged her to be married. She was supposed to go to India - but stayed behind with even more YB and ranch access. Her friends (other kids in the guardian program) left in the first group to Mussoorie, India. She ended up in LA and NM for a couple years back and forth. She was fully \u0022 out\u0022 at 13. Her dad stayed in until he died 16 years ago. Her mom left when she was 15 and she continued to work at the Golden Temple and stayed dressed in her turban while she worked. She died 7 years ago. Her whole life in 3HO was her life via her dad and friends. She didn\u0027t choose to \u201Cbe cut\u201D out. Until she was 40, she considered herself a Sikh. Only in the past two years did she finally recognize that she wasn\u0027t a Sikh. She was raised in a cult.

She then started going to 4AM sadhana and started a 40 day practice. At age 17, she attended her first Summer Solstice and went every year for the next 5\u0026#43; years and participated in the setup crew. Gradually, Goldie sank deeper into the lifestyle and was fully immersed in it until her early-mid 20s. Eventually, she left the KY community after finding abuse allegations from previous cases online and practiced Sikhism only for a period of time before leaving it altogether.

      "title": "Episode 52: Pritam Hari Kaur (Joined in 1981, Hamburg, Germany; 1987 moved to Johannesburg, South Africa)",
      "description": "Pritam Hari Kaur born in Germany and grew up in Indonesia and Spain, of German post-war parents who wanted nothing better than to head out into fresh and new horizons. After being kicked out of her house by father and step-mom at 19 years old, she felt orphaned, and eventually met Yogi Bhajan in 1981 at age 21; fully embraced the ashram lifestyle. Comforted under YB\u2019s tutelage and guidance at the European regional center in Hamburg. She was the European Regional Secretary from 1981 - 1987, co-organized the Annual Yoga Festival in France, the European Tantric Yoga Events and YB\u2019s visits, as well as traveled to New Mexico every year during this time frame 81 - 87. In 1986 he asked her if she wanted to join his staff in Espanola, NM. She declined with much sadness at the time, knowing that she would literally combust if she was there 24/7. YB introduced and arranged her marriage to Har Bhajan from South Africa and sent her to \u201Cdevelop\u201D the area there in 1987. In 1997, YB sent an African American \u2018Khalsa\u2019 to South Africa, a Sikh Dharma Minister, purportedly to support the \u2018mission\u2019. This teacher was a sex offender addict and seduced (women) in the name of \u201Ccounseling\u201D and moon center healing\u201D people under the banner of KY, right under our noses at the ashram and on his \u201Cduty\u201D as a minister of SD. They brought this to YB\u2019s attention at Solstice two years later (1999), and ensured the man didn\u0027t come back; and that he was NOT sent onward to another African country, Mozambique, which YB had wanted to do. Apparently, EPS, the ethics bureau, was created after this major and tragic scandal that never actually got recognized, reconciled, or resolved. It was said at the time that YB \u0027corrected\u0027 the man. However, the abusive transgressions were not conclusively dealt with via counseling and rehabilitation, being left in limbo for two decades beyond the original offenses. At the time, the South African Ashram moved on and did the best they could to continue focusing on teaching, growing their community and sharing the Yogic lifestyle. Their son Hari Bhajan left for school in India in 1999 at the age of 10. In 2004 when YB passed away, she went into deep grief. During this process she began taking a serious look at her own spiritual life and mental, emotional health. She noticed that despite decades of sadhana and so many tantrics and daily yoga, she was a high functioning depressive with little capacity for happiness, which made her feel flawed and ashamed. At this time, she started very deliberately working with herself to undo her own numbness and pain. She began to feel very different, not chasing elusive goals and keying herself up in spiritual bypass as a routine way of being. Her relationship with yogi bhajan came to feel settled and at peace. When the \u2018Premka book\u2019 came out in 2020, she already had some emotional tools for the complexity of it all, the abuses that were being revealed, despite the occasional sense of dissociation or disbelief. She\u2019s in a place where she still loves yoga and also holds the voices of the many persons who were harmed in her heart. There continue to be many local discussions around this and it remains an ongoing topic of transparency within our community.

We go into detail of her personal story of emotional/psychological abuse from her Teacher Tej Kaur (Los Angeles; Nine Treasures), other 3HO experiences including White Tantric Yoga for both Winter and Summer Solstice, Los Angeles, as well as the highly \u0022coveted\u0022 position and privilege of volunteering at the SSS Cabin to serve the subtle body of YB and the \u0022WTY Facilitators\u0022 who were the live in-person representatives of the Mahan Tantric himself. Lots of details and stories revealed in this episode. _______________ Jules Hartley joined 3HO in 2011, changed her name to Amrita Kaur, and actively participated as a kundalini yoga teacher, worked for WTY (Health\u0026Humanology), Golden Bridge Yoga, Nine Treasures Yoga, and performed work exchange for KRI and 3HO, and did seva at the RaMa Institute as well as the Guru Ram Das Ashram in LA through the end of 2018. She grew up in San Diego and Northern Virginia, and then went to college in New York City where she began her career as an actress and producer in the film \u0026 TV industry. Upon the suggestion of her manager at the time, she moved to Hollywood, where she lived for over a decade\u2013\u2013Much of which was defined by her life in 3HO, serving the community.

A second career in naturopathic medicine has given her a fresh perspective and the chance at a new start in my life since leaving the 3HO cult.

Being a restless seeker of answers and in the midst of incessant alcoholism and deep depression he begins taking regular kundalini classes in February 2006. Making great changes in his life, he takes his practice to the next level with TT at RaMa Mexico City in 2009. By 2010 he dedicates himself to teaching Kundalini classes, and by 2017 he graduated as a Level II teacher. During those years teaching kundalini classes and along with his work as a graphic designer, he developed his dream of becoming a Lead Trainer or \u201Cteacher of future kundalini yoga teachers\u201D in association with 3HO and KRI Kundalini Research Institute. In 2019 he starts an internet radio show called ComoUnidad Radio where he shares his yogic lifestyle grounded in daily life. The Premka book release in 2020 sent him into confusion; But it wasn\u2019t until 2021 that he finally cut ties with the RaMA Mexico City/3HO) base, TT Organization and 3HO altogether. Today he is the founder of the Ganesha Espacio Community, has changed his name to Siri Ganesha and is bringing yoga and meditation to low- and middle-income people. He currently spends most of his time teaching classes online and is passionate about music and cinema.

      "description": "Guru Gun Kaur, simply goes by Gigi, joined 3HO in 1972 at Mendocino Summer Solstice. She became devoted to the practice of yoga, cleansing and detoxing from her young adult years during the time of sex, drugs and rock and roll; moving away from the \u201Cnegative\u201D lifestyle, while rapidly moving toward her new found faith and \u201Cconscious\u201D family, led by Yogi Bhajan. For the next 12 years she immersed herself in the Sikh tradition of sacred music, Kirtan and her faith as a sacred devotion. She was arranged to be married in 1974 and soon after in 1976, YB influenced her to relinquish her family inheritance, which was eventually used to purchase the Summer Solstice land, known in 3HO as Ram Das Puri, in Espanol, New Mexico. In 1979 YB turned on Gigi, vowing to destroy her, and eventually influenced her to give up her children to her ex-husband. Yet she carried on as a devotee until December 1983, when she finally left; but remained devoted to the Sikh Faith. 2020 was an uproar which opened the old wounds and forced her into the swirl of all that went left unexamined. Today Gigi finds herself struggling to even keep a roof over her head, yet in spite of all of this trauma and loss, she knows she\u2019s on the path to healing the deep emotional wounds she has suffered. She\u2019s in contact with her children, who\u2019ve also shared their stories with her of their abuse during the years after she was forced to leave them behind. She\u2019s grateful for all spiritual support and prayers in the spirit of brotherly and sisterly love. * Show correction* The solstice land; Ram Das Puri is in the Jemez mountain range (not Truchas, which is to the East of the Sangres range) It is the Tewa People\u2019s land.

      "description": "Shanti Oshan, previously known as Shanti Karam Kaur has been practicing Kundalini Yoga since 2014 but became deeply involved when she met her teacher in 2019, Isa at a Sufi retreat in Southern California. This is when she vowed to seek Truth through the guidance of God\u2019s voice no matter what. She started Teacher Training in Oceanside, CA and dove headfirst into her path, going to the Sat Nam fest, Summer Solstice, followed by Winter Solstice. Last March, she went to the Espanola Ashram to be a farm intern on Khalsa Family Farms, and I wound up getting caught in the web of illusions in the 3HO/Kundalini Yoga community. There were red flags everywhere, but ended up falling in love with a man in the community this past June, marrying him then breaking it off on her honeymoon. Having experienced narcissistic, and misogynistic behavior, lies, manipulation, and abuse within the 3HO Community and with this man, she is here to share her story.

Through the training Alice/Ajeet fell in love with the Sikh Dharma and went to Khalsa Camp to discover it\u2019s depth, Alice/Ajeet went on to learn and embrace Sikhi from more Sikh camps, was blessed with Amrit in 2018 and given the name Taran Kaur, then legally changed it to Taranjeet-Kaur to honour a Kundalini background, ironically she has always shortened it to Taran.

She a big extended family in 3HO as well: 2 aunts \u0026 uncles, one set of grandparents, 5 cousins plus 1 aunt born in 3ho. And 2 sisters. Narangkar \u0026 her big sister were child-swapped when they were 7, sent to live in Ram Das Puri to live with strangers. In 1983 they got sent to India for boarding school first to GNFC School, and then GRD Academy, and also attended New Mexico Military Institute (which was a short-lived US-based school \u201Cprogram\u201D for 3HO kids).

Within 4 months of her first taste, her home burned down two days before the WorldTrade Centers fell and nearly took her with it and this led to her leaving her practice as a Corporate Securities Attorney who was \u201Cfailing at life and winning in success\u201D, to see if she could find a more peaceful way of being. After sharing over 1,000 Kundalini Yoga videos on YouTube creating a vibrant community and reaching her first million views, Shiv deleted all 1,465 one evening in August 2020 just days from the 19th anniversary of that first practice. She has dropped the dogma, ditched the Guru, and is continuing to explore life to the beat of her own drum, sharing tales along the way. Nature is her teacher and life is her practice.

He became involved in Kundalini Yoga/3HO during the years of 2010 to 2017 after suffering a herniated disc and cervical spine issues, seeking healing and repair after physical therapy. Keeping his original name, while integrating his new spiritual name, G\u00E9rard Jap Nirantar took to the intensity of Kundalini Yoga and Gong Meditation. After practicing for several years, and feeling the tremendous impact of the gong meditations on his own body, he got referred to Nanak Dev Singh in Berlin, GE, in which he studied and learned Gong Meditation Training in 2012. Among other things, in 2015 he began to notice the culture of silence at the European Yoga Festival and among the \u201Cleaders\u201D, that nobody was willing to openly discuss Karta Singh\u2019s sexual transgressions in France as a lead teacher, even though it was a major topic buzzing around. It would take him another two years to see through the facade of \u2018Sat Nam\u2019 and realize that a lot of truths, present and historical were not being talked about.

She\u0027s been practicing yoga and meditation since she was 9 years old. She entered the Kundalini Yoga community in 2000/2001, and even though the red flags were quite red, she didn\u0027t listen to her intuition, and started her path within the 3HO/Kundalini community anyway. She graduated from KY TT in Rome,Italy in 2003, and as an Associate Teacher Trainer officially in 2012. During this time frame, she alsa graduated as a Shakti Dance Instructor, which is a technology that is based on Kundalini Yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan. She graduated as a Lead Trainer for this discipline in 2012. She taught Shakti Dance at the summer and winter solstice until 2017, when she started to realize something was wrong within the community. In 2019, she left and broke ties with KY and SD, which has been so painful, after being ostracized and dedicating her entire life to these two technologies. She\u2019s grateful for her background as an artist because the pain of letting everything go, has been excruciating. She graduated in 2004 from the University of Turin, Italy, in History and Anthropology of Dance and Theater. She currently owns her own business teaching ancient movement and dance healing practices including her sacred modality Kundalini Rhythms Dance. She loves guiding people back to their power through the joy and sacredness of dance and Qigong.

Navigating a challenging early childhood with lots of chaotic changes, including her mother leaving the Dharma in 1978, custody battles and despicable communication between fighting parents, among other things. She grew up resilient, feisty and full of positivity to give to the world that she thought was the \u0022power of her light\u0022, rather than recognizing these symptoms as deeply rooted trauma patterns. At age 19 she lived and worked in the Johannesburg, S.A. 3HO Ashram, and later in the Herndon, Virginia Ashram as well (with interesting stories to share from both). After experiencing \u0022burn-out\u0022 in her decade long sales/wellness business career. She took Kundalini Yoga Teacher Training with Krishna Kaur in Los Angeles in 2009 to \u0022get back to her center and heal\u0022. She had zero interest in teaching KY as her living. After the final collapse and \u0022eerily familiar\u0022 demise of her business enterprise in 2012, she began to teach KY in Chicago as a way to move through her grief, confusion, fear and vitriol surfacing. SLOWLY, (many, many years), she began to recognize trauma patterns of \u0022emotional with-holding\u0022, \u0022emotional bypassing\u0022 \u0022white-washing positivity\u0022, and other symptoms her body was communicating as \u0022standard operation\u0022, and begin to recognize how KY was actually holding her body captive, NOT opening it up to freedom and space. It would take several more years and MANY more sexual embodiment practices before she could recognize her almost constant \u0022disassociation from her body\u0022, a shame-based self image disguised as \u0022perfected projection\u0022, \u0026 \u0022bright-light energy\u0022 as her outward persona. For several yeas she stopped teaching and practicing entirely except at the European Yoga Festival in 2016/2017/2018 as she oscillated between her \u0022love of KY\u0022 and her vitriol for aspects of \u0022The Teachings\u0022 that felt false, and riddled with corruption. In March 2020, she experience total liberation, and what felt like \u0022unhooking\u0022 from her 10th gate/Crown chakra/Source-Current, to finally SEE and HEAR publicly what her body had been communicating to her LOUDLY for the last 8 years; but her MIND could not accept. Lies, deceit, sadistic predatory abuse and manipulation were at the heart of her \u0022conscious community upbringing\u0022. Her story reveals details and descriptions of the complexity of love and abuse in an incestuous community upbringing; navigating uncertainty, the detriment of \u0022over-training your will-power\u0022, as well as tantalizing tales of SELF reclamation.

      "description": "Today\u0027s guest is Porter Singer (aka Sirgun Kaur) Porter Singer took her first Kundalini Yoga class at the Golden Bridge in Hollywood, CA in 2009. Drawn to the allure of this space and (mainly) the music they played, she signed up for a children\u2019s teacher training program that same day. It was in that training she met a fellow musician who invited her to be part of the Summer Solstice sound team, in June 2010. At Solstice, she learned about the month-long Aquarian teacher training at the Espa\u00F1ola ashram in August, which she ended up taking that year too. Upon returning from this 1-month intensive, she felt her identity slowly morph, adopting her spiritual name completely and wearing a head covering any time she went out. Propelled by what she believed to be positive changes in her life, she decided to skip Christmas with the family that year in favor of attending Winter Solstice. There, she reunited with two men from the Summer Solstice Sound Team who would launch her further along her 3HO path. At Summer Solstice 2011, she married Harimander Singh and also released her first mantra album \u0022The Music Within\u0022 with Sat Darshan Singh. This album contained the single \u201CBliss\u201D, which would become the soundtrack for a Yogi Bhajan slide show entitled \u201CFacets of the Master\u201D\u2014 played at every White Tantric Yoga event in the world. Things seemed to be evolving \u0022magically\u0022, and in 2013, after the birth of her first son, she released her second album. Postpartum depression was really her first clue that kundalini yoga, or \u201CYogi Bhajan\u201D, might not have, or be, the answer to everything. She started to seek alternate solutions to wellness. The more she researched and branched out, the more confining her life started to feel. And in 2019, she finally made the decision to separate from her husband and move from the Phoenix ashram community. She now lives in Washington state with her two boys and her new partner.

      "description": "Sof\u00EDa Becerra was born in Mexico City, to a non-practicing catholic family. She was always interested in spiritual experiences, and when she was 21-22 years old she lived two very traumatic experiences that involved sexual abuse and drugs, that left her very confused and in a cuasi schizophrenic state. In 2007, as part of her search for healing, she started practicing Kundalini Yoga in a place called \u0022Iztac\u0022. In 2008 she went to live in \u0022Guru Ram Das Ashram\u0022 in Mexico City, led by a couple of Yogis named Jai Hari Singh and Jai Hari Kaur. After around half a year of living there, she started having a sensual/sexual relationship with Jai Hari Singh; who quickly decided to divorce his wife, and begin a serious relationship with Sofia. This relationship lasted until 2014, until Sof\u00EDa finally had the courage to step out of it. Around 2018 Sof\u00EDa started to realize that the relationship had not been entirely consensual, because of the mental state that she was in when the relationship happened. Today Sof\u00EDa works as the director of an education NGO in a rural area in Mexico. She lives with her partner, two twin daughters, and one boy due to be born in May.
