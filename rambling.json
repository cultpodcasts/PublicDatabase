      "description": "Mike Treloar was born into and grew up in one of Australia\u0027s most extreme and dangerous cults, the Geelong Revival Centre. In this incredibly revealing and emotional conversation, Mike talks about how the GRC used fear, intimidation and physical abuse to control its members and to keep them from learning the secrets behind the cult\u0027s power.\nMike was a 3rd generation member of the GRC and, despite beginning to question some of the teachings of GRC and it\u0027s self-proclaimed prophet Pastor Noel Hollins, he only finally manage to leave it\u0027s clutches 5 years ago at the ages of 47.\nThis is the first time Mike has spoken about his life and some of the abuse, violence and coercive control he and his family witnessed and experienced while a member of this extremist organisation.\nWARNING: This conversation contains descriptions of physical violence toward children that some people may find disturbing.",
