He\u2019d known for a while that Thomas\u2019s health was in decline, but at this pivotal moment, he had no choice but to step into the role of caretaker\u2014a role Thomas himself was never able to grasp.\n \nIn The Mind is Burning, Jonathan recounts the stranger\u2013than\u2013fiction true story of the Hirsch family. Thomas was a Hungarian refugee turned spiritual seeker, and Jonathan was along for the ride as his parents chased the high of enlightenment, vacillating between following their doctrine to earn affection and finding his own voice. Thomas\u2019s quest eventually led them to Franklin Jones: known as either a charismatic, eccentric guru or a cult leader and sexual predator, depending on whether you were inside or outside his orbit.\n \nJonathan left home the day he turned eighteen, but almost twenty years later, he was pulled back into the chaotic fold when, just as he approached the biggest milestone of his career, Thomas was diagnosed with dementia. He became one of millions of Americans in the \u201Csandwich generation\u201D: middle\u2013aged adults simultaneously responsible for young children and aging parents. For Jonathan especially, that duty of care was fraught with emotional landmines, every impossible hardship of the present dredging up painful memories from the past\u2014memories that were slipping away from Thomas day by day.\n \nThis poetic yet propulsive memoir was created for the listening experience, and poses the question: What do we owe each other as family?\n\n\u2014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nJonathan Hirsch is an award\u2013winning podcast producer, executive, and host. He is the founder of Neon Hum Media, a partner company with Sony Music Entertainment.

Their secrets, rituals and shadowy hierarchies make for some of the most disturbing and shocking revelations in history. Most chilling of all is the fact that many of their followers forfeit all independence in order to carry out the often sadistic bidding of a mysterious master manipulator \u2013 and continue to defend their leader to this day. \n\nFrom Charles Manson, who instructed his followers to murder seven people, including a heavily pregnant Sharon Tate, to Aum Shinrikyo, the Japanese doomsday cult that carried out deadly terror attacks, and the People\u0027s Temple, these cults and their leaders transfix us with their extreme ability to commit savage acts of cruelty and depravity in the name of a self\u2013appointed higher power. \n\n50 shocking and international cults are brought to life, including:\n\n\u2013 The Manson Family\n\u2013 People\u0027s Temple\n\u2013 Colonia Dignidad\n\u2013 Thuggees\n\u2013 Aum Shinrikyo\n\u2013 Skopsty\n\u2013 Ra\u00EBlism\n\u2013 Heaven\u0027s Gate\n\n(P)2019 Quercus Editions Limited\n\n\u2014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nNigel Cawthorne is the author of a number of successful true crime and popular history books.

Henry James Prince was a rogue Anglican Priest with a flare for the dramatic, and the founder of the Agapemone, or \u0027Abode of Love\u0027. He also claimed to be the immortal conduit of The Holy Spirit and purportedly engaged in free love and ceremonial sex with his mostly female followers. But Prince\u0027s eventual death didn\u0027t mark the end of this strange set... he was promptly replaced by another. John Hugh Smyth-Pigott - otherwise known as the Clapton Messiah.\n\n\nThe Abode transformed a sleepy, rural corner of Somerset into one of England\u0027s most notorious locations. While the followers shut themselves away and waited patiently for the end of the world, outrage grew - the word \u0027Agapemone\u0027 because a byword for licentiousness or idleness, used by Charles Dickens and Ford Maddox Ford. The reclusive Clapton Messiah became a fixture in the nation\u0027s papers, with frenzied efforts to discredit the organisation and undermine its leader. And still the cult grew.\n\n\nExpertly drawing on primary sources to tell the story of the Agapemonites in details for the first time, Stuart Flinders shines a light on the people drawn to the cult - the forced marriages; the swindled fortunes; the women condemned to asylums; and those who managed to escape from the Abode. It is also the story of two extraordinary men, whose claims of divinity were at the heart of this very British cult.\n\n\u2014\nAUDIOBOOK DETAILS\n\nPurchase on Google Play Books \u25BA\u25BA https://g.co/booksYT/AQAAAECyoQbhpM\nLanguage: English\nPublisher: W.

When investigative journalist Gareth Gore was dispatched to report on the story, he expected to find yet another case of unbridled capitalist ambition gone wrong. Instead, he uncovered decades of deception that hid one of the most brazen cases of corporate pillaging in history, perpetrated by a group of men sworn to celibacy and self-flagellation who had secretly controlled Popular and abused their positions there to help spread Opus Dei to every corner of the world.\n\nDrawing on unparalleled access to bank records, insider accounts, and exclusive interviews with whistleblowers from within Opus Dei, Gore reveals how money from the bank was used to lure unsuspecting recruits \u2014 some of them only children \u2014 into a life of servitude. He also tracks the ascent of Opus Dei around the globe, exposing its role in bankrolling many right-wing causes, including the US Supreme Court\u0027s overturning of Roe v. Wade.\n\nIn an era of disinformation and deep fakes, here is a real-life conspiracy which hid in plain sight for more than sixty years. Gore tells a shocking story of money and power that spans decades and continents. Documenting Opus Dei\u0027s secret history for the first time, this thrilling work of investigative storytelling raises important questions about the dark forces that shape our society.\n\n\u2014\nAUDIOBOOK DETAILS\n\nPurchase on Google Play Books \u25BA\u25BA https://g.co/booksYT/AQAAAEAyuRD5MM\nLanguage: English\nPublisher: W.

Here, investigative journalist Matthew Remski explores how cultic dynamics, institutional self-interest, and spiritualized indifference collude to obscure the truth: Harm happens in plain sight.\n\nThrough in-depth interviews, insider analysis, and Remski\u2019s own history with high-demand groups, Surviving Modern Yoga brings to light how we\u2019re each susceptible to cult abuse and exploitation. He shows how, with the right kind of situational vulnerability and the wrong kind of guru, the ideas we hold close about ourselves\u2014like It wouldn\u2019t happen to me or I\u2019d speak up for victims\u2014fail to protect us.\n\nRemski reckons with his own complicity in spiritual power dynamics, and shares how a process of disillusionment allowed him to recognize harm. He does the same for readers, peeling back the veneer of yoga marketing to reveal the abuse, assault, and silencing perpetrated against seekers who trusted Jois as a mentor, their guruji\u2014even a father figure. Each survivor speaks in their own words, on their own terms, reclaiming agency against an insular, in-group culture that enabled a charismatic leader\u2019s devastating harm\u2014and positioned him as its only remedy.\n\nSurviving Modern Yoga also includes practical tools to help readers:\n   Understand how high-demand groups trap would-be targets  Evaluate their own situational vulnerabilities  Learn to listen for loaded, red-flag language  Cultivate their literacy of cult tactics\n\n\u2014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nMatthew Remski\u00A0is an author and freelance journalist, with bylines in The Walrus and GEN by Medium. Remski is a yoga practitioner who writes about yoga, abuse, and cults. His work is informed by his experiences as a member of multiple cults. \u00A0He\u2019s published eight books of poetry, fiction, and non-fiction, including Threads of Yoga: a remix of Patanjali\u2019s Sutras with commentary and reverie.

Everywhere we turn, someone is preaching the \u0022one true way\u0022 to eat for maximum health. Paleo Diet advocates tell us that all foods less than twelve thousand years old are the enemy. Low-carb gurus demonize carbs, and then there are the low-fat prophets. But they agree on one thing: there is only one true way to eat for maximum health. The first clue that this is a fallacy is the sheer variety of diets advocated. Indeed, while all of these competing views claim to be backed by science, a good look at actual nutritional science suggests it is impossible to identify a single best way to eat. Fitzgerald advocates an agnostic, rational approach to eating habits based on one\u0027s own habits, lifestyle, and genetics and body type. Many professional athletes already practice this \u0022Good Enough\u0022 diet, and now we can too\u2014and ditch the brainwashing of these diet cults for good.\n\n\u2014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nMatt Fitzgerald is an endurance sports writer, nutritionist, and author of more than twenty books. He is a coach and spokesperson for PEAR Sports and former senior editor at Triathlete and Competitor. Fitzgerald has contributed to Men\u0027s Health, Outside, Runner\u0027s World, Shape, and other publications. He lives in Northern California with his wife, Nataki.\n\n\nStephen R. Thorne is a professional actor and a member of the Trinity Repertory Company in Providence, Rhode Island. He has played Hamlet, Henry V, and Tom Joad, among many other roles.

In fact, the behaviors, social pressures, and authoritarian structures that create cults exist to a greater or lesser extent in every human relationship and every human group. In the first in-depth research of its kind, the author interviewed sixty-five people who were born in or grew up in thirty-nine different cultic groups spanning more than a dozen countries. What\u2019s especially interesting about these individuals is that they each left the cult on their own, without outside help or internal support. In Escaping Utopia: Growing Up in a Cult, Getting Out, and Starting Over, the authors craft Lalich\u2019s original and groundbreaking research into an accessible and engaging book, the first of its kind focusing on this particular population.\n\n\u2014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nJanja Lalich is a researcher, author, and educator specializing in self-sealing systems (cults, terrorist groups, situations of undue influence, and ideological extremism), with a particular focus on recruitment, indoctrination, and methods of influence and control. She is Professor Emerita of Sociology at California State University, Chico and has been studying the social psychology of controversial groups and exploitative and abusive relationships for thirty years.Her publications include Take Back Your Life: Recovering from Cults and Abusive Relationships (Bay Tree Press 2006) and Bounded Choice: True Believers and Charismatic Cults (University of California Press 2004).\n\nKarla McLaren is an award-winning author and social science researcher who grew up in a New Age healing cult in the San Francisco Bay Area. Her recent publications include The Art of Empathy: A Complete Guide to Life\u2019s Most Essential Skill (Sounds True 2013) and The Language of Emotions: What Your Feelings Are\u2026\n\n\u2014\nAUDIOBOOK DETAILS\n\nPurchase on Google Play Books \u25BA\u25BA https://g.co/booksYT/AQAAAED8liDWzM\nLanguage: English\nPublisher: Routledge\nPublished on: December 5, 2019\nISBN: 9780367405762\nDuration: 7 hr, 20 min\nGenres: Business \u0026 Economics / Organizational Behavior, Political Science / General, Psychology / Movements / General, Psychology / Social Psychology, Social Science / Criminology, Social Science / Social Classes \u0026 Economic Disparity, Social Science / Social Work, Social Science / Sociology / General",

It can make us unspeakably vulnerable to the manipulations of others. Cult leaders prey on this desire, but so do many unscrupulous operators hiding in plain sight.\n\nSarah Steel, the creator of the popular \u0027Let\u0027s Talk About Sects\u0027 podcast, has researched the cults you\u0027ve heard of - and dozens you haven\u0027t. What strikes her most are not the differences between bizarre cult behaviour and \u0027normal\u0027 behaviour but the depressing similarities. Her work reveals that we are all susceptible to the power of cult dynamics.\n\nIn Do As I Say, Sarah Steel tells the human tale behind the sensationalism. Sharing deeply personal stories, gathered over years of interviews with survivors, and some shocking tales about the world\u0027s most famous cults, she sheds light on the high cost of unchecked coercive behaviours to individuals and communities at large.\n\n\nPraise for Do As I Say\n\n\u0027Sarah uses the stories of survivors to tease out the common threads of coercive control shared by cults and found in other parts of society. The result is a much-needed spotlight on the behaviours and personalities we are likely to encounter even if we never go anywhere near a cult.\u0027 - David Gillespie, bestselling author and lawyer\n\n\u0027In times of uncertainty when you long for simple answers and have a deep desire for community, you can find yourself incrementally handing over your agency to a charismatic but authoritarian and manipulative leader or group-think. In this book Sarah Steel has brilliantly charted how this happens in all sorts of ways and for all sorts of people; it provides an invaluable map to navigate this dangerous terrain.\u0027 - Reverend Tim Costello AO\n\n\u0027This book is a most comprehensive and studied look at cults, the leaders, and perhaps most importantly the survivors. Sarah Steel has given the world a real gem - one that will not only educate but also help to destigmatize those who have been harmed by cults and con artists. Bravo!\u0027 - Dr Janja Lalich, cult expert, academic and former cult member\n\n\u2014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nSarah researches, writes, records and edits \u0027Let\u0027s Talk About Sects\u0027. Her writing has been published in The Guardian, Indiewire and ABC Online, and she has appeared on SBS\u0027s The Feed and Channel 9\u0027s Today Show. Her work has been commissioned for ABC Radio National\u0027s Earshot program, and she has also featured on ABC Radio\u0027s Overnights program. For Vivid Sydney 2022 Sarah presented the sold out panel discussion \u0027Sects, Lies and Cults\u0027 with three former cult members.\n\n\u2014\nAUDIOBOOK DETAILS\n\nPurchase on Google Play Books \u25BA\u25BA https://g.co/booksYT/AQAAAEACiBzIDM\nLanguage: English\nPublisher: Macmillan Publishers Australia\nPublished on: June 28, 2022\nISBN: 9781761263187\nDuration: 9 hr, 7 min\nGenres: Family \u0026 Relationships / General, Psychology / Emotions, Psychology / General, Psychology / Psychopathology / General, Self-Help / General, Self-Help / Personal Growth / General",

Now in her forties with two teenage children of her own, Faith\u0027s first-person narrative alternates between her childhood adventures and traumas within the cult and her post-cult life following her escape at the age of 19. \n\nFaith travelled the world as a child with the Children of God - to Argentina, Mexico, Spain, India and Greece. Her story features a supporting cast of multiple siblings, eccentric parents and countless transient friends, spiritual leaders, and abusers. And the story of her life in the cult concludes in London, where she is isolated from her family and used as a domestic slave. Faith shares her post-escape experiences of re-entering education for the first time since she was ten, her self-directed deprogramming, and her quest for justice through campaigning and confrontation.\n\nIt\u0027s easy to think of cults as yesterday\u0027s news, and as organisations that operate in other countries, but some of Faith\u0027s most horrible experiences in the cult happened to her in North London. In Rebel, Faith writes about how we need to look and to see what is hiding in plain sight. But more than this, we all need to be wiser to our own vulnerability as adults, our credulity and susceptibility to misinformation and our readiness to take the bait, when it looks like the answer.\n\n(P) 2021 Hodder \u0026 Stoughton Ltd\n\n\u2014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nFaith Morgan was born in 1973 to a Costa Rican father and English mother. The third child of seven, she was the first of her siblings to be born into the cult The Children of God, later known as The Family of Love. During her time in the cult she lived in communes and travelled extensively as directed by the cult leaders with the purpose of spreading the word. In early 1991, aged 19, she found the courage to escape and now lives in the Home Counties with her family.

She grew up enthralled by the myth of him - a brilliant, charismatic writer and entrepreneur who would appear with gifts from faraway places.

As a child, however, she had none. Growing up as a member of the infamous cult The Children of God, Hough had her own self robbed from her. The cult took her all over the globe--to Germany, Japan, Texas, Chile--but it wasn\u0027t until she finally left for good that Lauren understood she could have a life beyond \u0022The Family.\u0022\n\nAlong the way, she\u0027s loaded up her car and started over, trading one life for the next. She\u0027s taken pilgrimages to the sights of her youth, been kept in solitary confinement, dated a lot of women, dabbled in drugs, and eventually found herself as what she always wanted to be: a writer. Here, as she sweeps through the underbelly of America--relying on friends, family, and strangers alike--she begins to excavate a new identity even as her past continues to trail her and color her world, relationships, and perceptions of self.\n\nAt once razor-sharp, profoundly brave, and often very, very funny, the essays in Leaving Isn\u0027t the Hardest Thing interrogate our notions of ecstasy, queerness, and what it means to live freely. Each piece is a reckoning: of survival, identity, and how to reclaim one\u0027s past when carving out a future.\n\n(P) 2021 Hodder \u0026 Stoughton Ltd\n\n\u2014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nLAUREN HOUGH was born in Germany and raised in seven countries and West Texas.

Isolated on a farm in Macau, she practised devotions and read letters of prophecy written by her grandfather, the leader of the now infamous cult, The Children of God. A direct decedent of the founding family, Faith featured in international media coverage \u2013 she was celebrated as extraordinary and then published doubly as a sharp reminder that she was not. \n\nWith indomitable grit, Faith created a world of her own, pilfering books and educating herself in secret. At the age of 23, she escaped, abandoning her history, her inheritance and her legacy. While her childhood friends succumbed to addiction, suicide and prostitution, Faith fought her way into Georgetown University and went on to establish a successful career in law. \n\nSex Cult Nun is an enthralling coming-of-age story that gives fascinating insight into the closed and complex world of extreme belief. Exploring the issues of psychological and physical control, Faith draws on her hard-won insight to interrogate the binaries of good and evil, and shed light on the insidiousness of oppression. At its heart, this extraordinary story is a stark warning about the consequences of surrendering our rights and responsibilities.\n\n\u2014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nFaith Jones is a lawyer, activist, entrepreneur, and business coach.

Eventually these murders were connected to Cecilia Steyn and her cult, Electus per Deus (chosen by God). Members of the cult were willing to do anything for Cecilia \u2013 even if it meant committing murder. Who is Cecilia Steyn? How can one person manipulate five others to commit murder and perjury on her behalf? How did Satanism contribute to all of this? How did inexperienced criminals manage to evade capture for so long? Jana Marx answers these and other questions in this true-crime account that led to one of the most sensational murder cases in the country\u2019s history. Through interviews with those in the inner circle, evidence given in court and police files covering a period of four years, Marx attempts to answer the public\u2019s questions and provide a view of the inner workings of such a cult. Narrated and produced by Nicole Engelbrecht.\n\n\u2014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nJana Marx is an award-winning journalist, TV producer, and best-selling South African author with a successful track record of working in the media production industry.

Four years later, the incendiary Rajneeshpuram commune in Oregon collapsed under the weight of audacious criminal conspiracies hatched in its inner sanctum, including the largest bioterrorism attack in US history, an unprecedented election fraud scheme, and multiple attempted murders.\n\nRajneeshpuram explores how this extraordinary spiritual community, featured in the Netflix docuseries Wild Wild Country, went so wrong. Drawing from extensive interviews with former disciples and an unprecedented review of commune records, government and police files, and archival materials, author Russell King probes the charismatic power that Bhagwan (later known as Osho) and Sheela exercised over the community and the turbulent legal and political environment that left commune leaders ready to deceive, poison, and even murder to preserve their home and their master.\n\nRajneeshpuram is a fresh examination of the Rajneesh story, using newly available information and interviews with high-ranking disciples who have never before shared their stories.\n\n\u2014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nRussell King is a writer, investigator, and attorney. In 2018 he created the podcast Building Utopia: Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, which explores the history of Bhagwan and his disciples using an immersive narrative nonfiction approach. A former partner at an international law firm who specialized in complex litigation, King draws on his experience piecing together factual narratives based on contradictory evidence to tackle this rich and complicated history.\n\n\u2014\nAUDIOBOOK DETAILS\n\nPurchase on Google Play Books \u25BA\u25BA https://g.co/booksYT/AQAAAEACnFHcQM\nLanguage: English\nPublisher: Blackstone Publishing\nPublished on: March 8, 2022\nISBN: 9798200894826\nDuration: 11 hr, 30 min\nGenres: Religion / Cults, True Crime / General",

But none has been quite so dramatic or compelling as the Jonestown massacre of 1978, in which the Reverend Jim Jones and 913 of his disciples perished. Deborah Layton had been a member of the Peoples Temple for seven years when she departed for Jonestown, Guyana, the promised land nestled deep in the South American jungle. When she arrived, however, Layton saw that something was seriously wrong. Jones constantly spoke of a revolutionary mass suicide, and Layton knew only too well that he had enough control over the minds of the Jonestown residents to carry it out. But her pleas for help--and her sworn affidavit to the U.S. government--fell on skeptical ears. In this very personal account, Layton opens up the shadowy world of cults and shows how anyone can fall under their spell. Seductive Poison is both an unflinching historical document and a riveting story of intrigue, power, and murder.\n\n\nPRAISE:\n\u0022A suspenseful tale of escape that reads like a satisfying thriller, Layton\u0027s account is the most important personal testimony to emerge from the Jonestown tragedy.\u0022 --The Chicago Tribune\n\u00A0\n\u0022A fascinating account of a debacle that continues to resonate\u0022\u00A0--Entertainment Weekly\n\u00A0\n\u0022Layton is scrupulous and honest... A terrific read... a page turner to rival the best spy thriller.\u0022 --The Evening Standard UK\n\u00A0\n\u0022Even teens unfamiliar with Jonestown will find this a powerful memoir.\u0022 --Booklist\n\u00A0\n\u0022A chilling account... Truly unforgettable\u0022\u00A0--Kirkus Review (starred review)\n\u00A0\n\u00A0\u201CSeductive Poison is an absolutely riveting story, told as memoir but with the pulse-pounding suspense of a murder mystery. I read Layton\u0027s account non-stop through the night, unable to let go, struck by the realization that this is not simply an account of a bygone tragedy. It has great relevance to many of the terrible events we see unfolding today, for this is a story about those who seek a better world and are then inextricably caught in a plan to end it. This is a universal tale about ideology gone awry.\u201D --Amy Tan\n\u00A0\n\u201CCults are multiplying and growing in this country. Why do apparently normal people surrender in body and soul to a charismatic\u2026\n\n\u2014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nDeborah Layton was born in 1953 and grew up in Berkeley, California.
