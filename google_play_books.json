Here, investigative journalist Matthew Remski explores how cultic dynamics, institutional self-interest, and spiritualized indifference collude to obscure the truth: Harm happens in plain sight.\n\nThrough in-depth interviews, insider analysis, and Remski\u2019s own history with high-demand groups, Surviving Modern Yoga brings to light how we\u2019re each susceptible to cult abuse and exploitation. He shows how, with the right kind of situational vulnerability and the wrong kind of guru, the ideas we hold close about ourselves\u2014like It wouldn\u2019t happen to me or I\u2019d speak up for victims\u2014fail to protect us.\n\nRemski reckons with his own complicity in spiritual power dynamics, and shares how a process of disillusionment allowed him to recognize harm. He does the same for readers, peeling back the veneer of yoga marketing to reveal the abuse, assault, and silencing perpetrated against seekers who trusted Jois as a mentor, their guruji\u2014even a father figure. Each survivor speaks in their own words, on their own terms, reclaiming agency against an insular, in-group culture that enabled a charismatic leader\u2019s devastating harm\u2014and positioned him as its only remedy.\n\nSurviving Modern Yoga also includes practical tools to help readers:\n   Understand how high-demand groups trap would-be targets  Evaluate their own situational vulnerabilities  Learn to listen for loaded, red-flag language  Cultivate their literacy of cult tactics\n\n\u2014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nMatthew Remski\u00A0is an author and freelance journalist, with bylines in The Walrus and GEN by Medium. Remski is a yoga practitioner who writes about yoga, abuse, and cults. His work is informed by his experiences as a member of multiple cults. \u00A0He\u2019s published eight books of poetry, fiction, and non-fiction, including Threads of Yoga: a remix of Patanjali\u2019s Sutras with commentary and reverie.

On November 18th, 1978, over 900 people including a U.S. congressman Leo Ryan died because of Cult Leader Jim Jones. Over 300 were children forced to drink cyanide-laced Kool-Aid by their parents who believed they were doing God\u2019s will. A vast array of methods exist to deceive, manipulate, and indoctrinate people into closed systems of obedience and dependency.

Everywhere we turn, someone is preaching the \u0022one true way\u0022 to eat for maximum health. Paleo Diet advocates tell us that all foods less than twelve thousand years old are the enemy. Low-carb gurus demonize carbs, and then there are the low-fat prophets. But they agree on one thing: there is only one true way to eat for maximum health. The first clue that this is a fallacy is the sheer variety of diets advocated. Indeed, while all of these competing views claim to be backed by science, a good look at actual nutritional science suggests it is impossible to identify a single best way to eat. Fitzgerald advocates an agnostic, rational approach to eating habits based on one\u0027s own habits, lifestyle, and genetics and body type. Many professional athletes already practice this \u0022Good Enough\u0022 diet, and now we can too\u2014and ditch the brainwashing of these diet cults for good.\n\n\u2014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nMatt Fitzgerald is an endurance sports writer, nutritionist, and author of more than twenty books. He is a coach and spokesperson for PEAR Sports and former senior editor at Triathlete and Competitor. Fitzgerald has contributed to Men\u0027s Health, Outside, Runner\u0027s World, Shape, and other publications. He lives in Northern California with his wife, Nataki.\n\n\nStephen R. Thorne is a professional actor and a member of the Trinity Repertory Company in Providence, Rhode Island. He has played Hamlet, Henry V, and Tom Joad, among many other roles. Stephen has narrated over fifty audiobooks.\n\n\u2014\nAUDIOBOOK DETAILS\n\nPurchase on Google Play Books \u25BA\u25BA https://g.co/booksYT/AQAAAABMMFMwDM\nLanguage: English\nPublisher: Blackstone Audio Inc.\nPublished on: May 15, 2014\nISBN: 9781482993356\nDuration: 9 hr, 24 min\nGenres: Health \u0026 Fitness / Diet \u0026 Nutrition / Diets, Health \u0026 Fitness / Diet \u0026 Nutrition / Nutrition, Health \u0026 Fitness / Diet \u0026 Nutrition / Weight Loss",

In fact, the behaviors, social pressures, and authoritarian structures that create cults exist to a greater or lesser extent in every human relationship and every human group. In the first in-depth research of its kind, the author interviewed sixty-five people who were born in or grew up in thirty-nine different cultic groups spanning more than a dozen countries. What\u2019s especially interesting about these individuals is that they each left the cult on their own, without outside help or internal support. In Escaping Utopia: Growing Up in a Cult, Getting Out, and Starting Over, the authors craft Lalich\u2019s original and groundbreaking research into an accessible and engaging book, the first of its kind focusing on this particular population.\n\n\u2014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nJanja Lalich is a researcher, author, and educator specializing in self-sealing systems (cults, terrorist groups, situations of undue influence, and ideological extremism), with a particular focus on recruitment, indoctrination, and methods of influence and control. She is Professor Emerita of Sociology at California State University, Chico and has been studying the social psychology of controversial groups and exploitative and abusive relationships for thirty years.Her publications include Take Back Your Life: Recovering from Cults and Abusive Relationships (Bay Tree Press 2006) and Bounded Choice: True Believers and Charismatic Cults (University of California Press 2004).\n\nKarla McLaren is an award-winning author and social science researcher who grew up in a New Age healing cult in the San Francisco Bay Area. Her recent publications include The Art of Empathy: A Complete Guide to Life\u2019s Most Essential Skill (Sounds True 2013) and The Language of Emotions: What Your Feelings Are\u2026\n\n\u2014\nAUDIOBOOK DETAILS\n\nPurchase on Google Play Books \u25BA\u25BA https://g.co/booksYT/AQAAAED8liDWzM\nLanguage: English\nPublisher: Routledge\nPublished on: December 5, 2019\nISBN: 9780367405762\nDuration: 7 hr, 20 min\nGenres: Business \u0026 Economics / Organizational Behavior, Political Science / General, Psychology / Movements / General, Psychology / Social Psychology, Social Science / Criminology, Social Science / Social Classes \u0026 Economic Disparity, Social Science / Social Work, Social Science / Sociology / General",

It can make us unspeakably vulnerable to the manipulations of others. Cult leaders prey on this desire, but so do many unscrupulous operators hiding in plain sight.\n\nSarah Steel, the creator of the popular \u0027Let\u0027s Talk About Sects\u0027 podcast, has researched the cults you\u0027ve heard of - and dozens you haven\u0027t. What strikes her most are not the differences between bizarre cult behaviour and \u0027normal\u0027 behaviour but the depressing similarities. Her work reveals that we are all susceptible to the power of cult dynamics.\n\nIn Do As I Say, Sarah Steel tells the human tale behind the sensationalism. Sharing deeply personal stories, gathered over years of interviews with survivors, and some shocking tales about the world\u0027s most famous cults, she sheds light on the high cost of unchecked coercive behaviours to individuals and communities at large.\n\n\nPraise for Do As I Say\n\n\u0027Sarah uses the stories of survivors to tease out the common threads of coercive control shared by cults and found in other parts of society. The result is a much-needed spotlight on the behaviours and personalities we are likely to encounter even if we never go anywhere near a cult.\u0027 - David Gillespie, bestselling author and lawyer\n\n\u0027In times of uncertainty when you long for simple answers and have a deep desire for community, you can find yourself incrementally handing over your agency to a charismatic but authoritarian and manipulative leader or group-think. In this book Sarah Steel has brilliantly charted how this happens in all sorts of ways and for all sorts of people; it provides an invaluable map to navigate this dangerous terrain.\u0027 - Reverend Tim Costello AO\n\n\u0027This book is a most comprehensive and studied look at cults, the leaders, and perhaps most importantly the survivors. Sarah Steel has given the world a real gem - one that will not only educate but also help to destigmatize those who have been harmed by cults and con artists. Bravo!\u0027 - Dr Janja Lalich, cult expert, academic and former cult member\n\n\u2014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nSarah researches, writes, records and edits \u0027Let\u0027s Talk About Sects\u0027. Her writing has been published in The Guardian, Indiewire and ABC Online, and she has appeared on SBS\u0027s The Feed and Channel 9\u0027s Today Show.

Now in her forties with two teenage children of her own, Faith\u0027s first-person narrative alternates between her childhood adventures and traumas within the cult and her post-cult life following her escape at the age of 19. \n\nFaith travelled the world as a child with the Children of God - to Argentina, Mexico, Spain, India and Greece. Her story features a supporting cast of multiple siblings, eccentric parents and countless transient friends, spiritual leaders, and abusers. And the story of her life in the cult concludes in London, where she is isolated from her family and used as a domestic slave. Faith shares her post-escape experiences of re-entering education for the first time since she was ten, her self-directed deprogramming, and her quest for justice through campaigning and confrontation.\n\nIt\u0027s easy to think of cults as yesterday\u0027s news, and as organisations that operate in other countries, but some of Faith\u0027s most horrible experiences in the cult happened to her in North London. In Rebel, Faith writes about how we need to look and to see what is hiding in plain sight. But more than this, we all need to be wiser to our own vulnerability as adults, our credulity and susceptibility to misinformation and our readiness to take the bait, when it looks like the answer.\n\n(P) 2021 Hodder \u0026 Stoughton Ltd\n\n\u2014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nFaith Morgan was born in 1973 to a Costa Rican father and English mother. The third child of seven, she was the first of her siblings to be born into the cult The Children of God, later known as The Family of Love. During her time in the cult she lived in communes and travelled extensively as directed by the cult leaders with the purpose of spreading the word. In early 1991, aged 19, she found the courage to escape and now lives in the Home Counties with her family. Faith Morgan is a pseudonym.\n\n\u2014\nAUDIOBOOK DETAILS\n\nPurchase on Google Play Books \u25BA\u25BA https://g.co/booksYT/AQAAAEDcYUQhiM\nLanguage: English\nPublisher: Hodder \u0026 Stoughton\nPublished on: June 17, 2021\nISBN: 9781529347623\nDuration: 7 hr, 55 min\nGenres: Biography \u0026 Autobiography / Personal Memoirs, Biography \u0026 Autobiography / Religious, Religion / Cults",

She grew up enthralled by the myth of him - a brilliant, charismatic writer and entrepreneur who would appear with gifts from faraway places. Yet he was also a compulsive liar whose pursuit of transcendence took him from sex addiction, via the Rajneesh cult, to a relentless chase of money, which ended in ruin and finally addiction to alcohol and prescription drugs. A daughter\u0027s investigation into a father who was always out of reach, Sins of My Father is a gripping detective story that asks how much we can forgive of those we love.\n\n\u2014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nLily Dunn is a writer, teacher and lecturer in creative writing and narrative nonfiction at Bath Spa University. She is the author of one novel, SHADOWING THE SUN, and co-editor with Zoe Gilbert of A WILD AND PRECIOUS LIFE, an anthology of recovery stories.\n\n\u2014\nAUDIOBOOK DETAILS\n\nPurchase on Google Play Books \u25BA\u25BA https://g.co/booksYT/AQAAAEB8Rw0HYM\nLanguage: English\nPublisher: Weidenfeld \u0026 Nicolson\nPublished on: March 17, 2022\nISBN: 9781474623391\nDuration: 8 hr, 58 min\nGenres: Biography \u0026 Autobiography / Personal Memoirs, Family \u0026 Relationships / Dysfunctional Families, Family \u0026 Relationships / General, Psychology / Psychopathology / Addiction, Religion / Cults",

As a child, however, she had none. Growing up as a member of the infamous cult The Children of God, Hough had her own self robbed from her. The cult took her all over the globe--to Germany, Japan, Texas, Chile--but it wasn\u0027t until she finally left for good that Lauren understood she could have a life beyond \u0022The Family.\u0022\n\nAlong the way, she\u0027s loaded up her car and started over, trading one life for the next. She\u0027s taken pilgrimages to the sights of her youth, been kept in solitary confinement, dated a lot of women, dabbled in drugs, and eventually found herself as what she always wanted to be: a writer. Here, as she sweeps through the underbelly of America--relying on friends, family, and strangers alike--she begins to excavate a new identity even as her past continues to trail her and color her world, relationships, and perceptions of self.\n\nAt once razor-sharp, profoundly brave, and often very, very funny, the essays in Leaving Isn\u0027t the Hardest Thing interrogate our notions of ecstasy, queerness, and what it means to live freely. Each piece is a reckoning: of survival, identity, and how to reclaim one\u0027s past when carving out a future.\n\n(P) 2021 Hodder \u0026 Stoughton Ltd\n\n\u2014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nLAUREN HOUGH was born in Germany and raised in seven countries and West Texas. She\u0027s been an airman in the U.S. Air Force, a green-aproned barista, a bartender, a livery driver, and, for a time, a cable guy. Her work has appeared in Granta, The Wrath-Bearing Tree, The Guardian, and HuffPost.

Isolated on a farm in Macau, she practised devotions and read letters of prophecy written by her grandfather, the leader of the now infamous cult, The Children of God. A direct decedent of the founding family, Faith featured in international media coverage \u2013 she was celebrated as extraordinary and then published doubly as a sharp reminder that she was not. \n\nWith indomitable grit, Faith created a world of her own, pilfering books and educating herself in secret. At the age of 23, she escaped, abandoning her history, her inheritance and her legacy. While her childhood friends succumbed to addiction, suicide and prostitution, Faith fought her way into Georgetown University and went on to establish a successful career in law. \n\nSex Cult Nun is an enthralling coming-of-age story that gives fascinating insight into the closed and complex world of extreme belief. Exploring the issues of psychological and physical control, Faith draws on her hard-won insight to interrogate the binaries of good and evil, and shed light on the insidiousness of oppression. At its heart, this extraordinary story is a stark warning about the consequences of surrendering our rights and responsibilities.\n\n\u2014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nFaith Jones is a lawyer, activist, entrepreneur, and business coach. She began her career as an attorney with Skadden Arps representing clients in a wide variety of cross-border corporate transactions and has worked with businesses and government leaders in the Pacific Rim.

Eventually these murders were connected to Cecilia Steyn and her cult, Electus per Deus (chosen by God). Members of the cult were willing to do anything for Cecilia \u2013 even if it meant committing murder. Who is Cecilia Steyn? How can one person manipulate five others to commit murder and perjury on her behalf? How did Satanism contribute to all of this? How did inexperienced criminals manage to evade capture for so long? Jana Marx answers these and other questions in this true-crime account that led to one of the most sensational murder cases in the country\u2019s history. Through interviews with those in the inner circle, evidence given in court and police files covering a period of four years, Marx attempts to answer the public\u2019s questions and provide a view of the inner workings of such a cult. Narrated and produced by Nicole Engelbrecht.\n\n\u2014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nJana Marx is an award-winning journalist, TV producer, and best-selling South African author with a successful track record of working in the media production industry.

Four years later, the incendiary Rajneeshpuram commune in Oregon collapsed under the weight of audacious criminal conspiracies hatched in its inner sanctum, including the largest bioterrorism attack in US history, an unprecedented election fraud scheme, and multiple attempted murders.\n\nRajneeshpuram explores how this extraordinary spiritual community, featured in the Netflix docuseries Wild Wild Country, went so wrong. Drawing from extensive interviews with former disciples and an unprecedented review of commune records, government and police files, and archival materials, author Russell King probes the charismatic power that Bhagwan (later known as Osho) and Sheela exercised over the community and the turbulent legal and political environment that left commune leaders ready to deceive, poison, and even murder to preserve their home and their master.\n\nRajneeshpuram is a fresh examination of the Rajneesh story, using newly available information and interviews with high-ranking disciples who have never before shared their stories.\n\n\u2014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nRussell King is a writer, investigator, and attorney. In 2018 he created the podcast Building Utopia: Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, which explores the history of Bhagwan and his disciples using an immersive narrative nonfiction approach. A former partner at an international law firm who specialized in complex litigation, King draws on his experience piecing together factual narratives based on contradictory evidence to tackle this rich and complicated history.\n\n\u2014\nAUDIOBOOK DETAILS\n\nPurchase on Google Play Books \u25BA\u25BA https://g.co/booksYT/AQAAAEACnFHcQM\nLanguage: English\nPublisher: Blackstone Publishing\nPublished on: March 8, 2022\nISBN: 9798200894826\nDuration: 11 hr, 30 min\nGenres: Religion / Cults, True Crime / General",
