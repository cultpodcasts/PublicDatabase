      "description": "Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor\u0027s most senior aide appears to have drafted a statement intended for Ghislaine Maxwell to release which said the former prince did meet Virginia Giuffre and had his photo taken with her\u2014contradicting his later defence.\nAndrew forwarded the message on to Jeffrey Epstein without contradicting the factual account, new emails containd in the Epstein Files and seen by Newsweek show. Andrew would later tell the BBC they had never met and that when the allegation first came to light he thought: \u0022Well that\u0027s a bit strange, I don\u0027t remember this.\u0022\nYet, had the statement been published, it would have meant Maxwell had confirmed the meeting took place and, seemingly, also that the photo was real.\nAndrew has always denied Giuffre\u0027s allegations. She sued him in 2021 accusing him of rape and he settled for an undisclosed sum while denying liability. \n\nSubscribe on YouTube: https://bit.ly/2JjpnIb\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Newsweek\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Newsweek\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/Newsweek\nhttps://www.newsweek.com",

Virginia Giuffre separately sued Andrew at civil court in New York and they settled for an undisclosed sum in 2022. Andrew has always denied the allegations and did not admit liability. Newsweek\u0027s chief royal correspondent Jack Royston and Graham Smith, chief executive of anti-monarchy campaign group Republic, discuss the long term implications for the Monarchy. King Charles reported helped Andrew cover the costs of the settlement with Giuffre\u2014but would the public accept him doing so again?\n \n\nSubscribe on YouTube: https://bit.ly/2JjpnIb\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Newsweek\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Newsweek\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/Newsweek\nhttps://www.newsweek.com",
