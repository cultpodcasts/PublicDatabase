It\u2019s a story of money laundering, fraud and financial opacity that made possible the scale of one of if not the most influential and pernicious and influential catholic organisations int he world. But it\u2019s not just a benign organisation that creates a welcoming community for catholics the world over, it is an organisation which has been accused of 100\u2019s if not thousands of incidents of human trafficking, sexual abuse and drug abuse and are attempting to influence their worldview through the rewriting of legal systems. A worldview that reflects the most conservative and man made fundamentalist interpretations of the bible. \n\nThis book by Gareth Gore is an immense achievement that proves an otherwise held conspiracy, of financial fraud at the scale of hundreds of millions of dollars, political corruption and a secret society exerting their influence on the halls of power that you and I are subject to. \n\n\n\n00:00 - What Is Opus Dei?\n02:30 - How Did This Story Get On Gareth\u0027s Radar?\n09:30 - What Is Opus Dei In Gareth\u0027s Words\n24:47 - Josemaria Escriva...
