      "description": "Kyle is host of YouTube channel/podcast Cowtipper Vern and one of the four moderators and founders of the ex 2x2 Facebook support group. On his YouTube channel Kyle explore topics around 2x2 culture \u2013 deconstruction, behaviour, language, story telling. Kyle explores here what Truth 2x2 culture looks like and some of the challenges we face defining language and beliefs, in a culture where very little is explicitly named or written down. The naming of our culture in Truth 2x2s is powerful \u2013 exploring how that culture enables silent treatment, cover ups, abuse of power, isolation and loneliness. We leave this episode with a challenge to pause and observe how 2x2 culture plays out in your life \u2013 both positive and negative. This is the final episode of Season 1, thank you for listening to the first season. I\u2019ll be taking a short break until September, when I\u2019ll return for Season 2.

      "description": "In this episode with Alex we explore racism, white saviourism, compulsory heterosexuality and queerphobia inside Truth 2x2s. If that wasn\u2019t enough complexity to manage for Alex and I \u2013 we also discuss Pentecostalism, and the shapeshifting Alex had to manage in order to be a devout Truth 2x2 at home and a good Pentecostal at school. Alex certainly navigated theological whiplash. The impact of colonialism and racism is often swept aside in cult survivor conversations. I\u2019m grateful Alex was brave enough to share some experiences of this with us. Truth 2x2s have Workers, in particular older white men as Overseers, in countries such as Vietnam, India, China, Malaysia, Philippines, Timor Leste and Papua New Guinea. The colonial mindset, the white saviourism is evident in the letters and emails they send home to Friends.\n\u00A0\nThank you for listening to Episode 3 of Truth 2x2 Cult Kids Podcast.

We explore how Bob Barlow took a lot of the behaviours and the culture of Truth 2x2s and created a similar group under a different name. This is one of my concerns with the current exodus of Truth 2x2 Friends around the world, post Dean Bruer fall out \u2013 that people will leave and create break away groups without deconstructing from Truth 2x2 ideology.\nCandice is a teacher and has a deep concern about the treatment of women and children inside high control groups such as the Bob Barlow and Truth 2x2s. We explore themes of pressure to marry (coerced and pressured marriage), comphet and purity culture, physical disciplining of children, shame, guilt.\n\u00A0\nShow Notes:\nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@truth2x2survivor\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/lauramc.au/\nWebsite: https://www.lauramcconnell.com.au/\n\u00A0\nLinks to Support:\nLBH good trauma informed, cult sensitive therapists and support are hard to find.

      "description": "Maria Hutchison is a survivor of the Truth 2x2\u0027s from New Zealand. She now lives in Melbourne Australia. She founded With Freedom Coaching, working as an addiction counsellor and coach. She experienced abuse inside Truth 2x2\u0027s, which was swept away and silenced. Maria works with trauma survivors, leveraging her deep lived experience of trauma and recovery. She wrote a book on her experiences and her work, Facing Maria. In this episode Maria shares some of her experiences inside Truth 2x2s, her experience of speaking up about abuse and how it was subsequently silenced for decades. She shares how she spoke with Australian Overseers (lead clergy) about trauma informed care of Truth 2x2 survivors, offering to provide them with support. Sadly, she never heard back from them to take her up on the offer. Maria is generous in her story telling and sharing, humorous and kind. I\u2019m grateful she trusted me (and you) with her story of surviving the Truth 2x2s and building a beautiful life post-leaving.

      "description": "This is an introduction to the Truth 2x2 cult, an overview of group, its history, culture and behaviours.\nThis episode is broadly based on a presentation that I gave at DeCult conference in Christchurch in October 2024. Information about that conference, access to resources and information can be found on the Decult website, which I\u2019d recommend as a good resource for cult survivors in general, not just from the Truth 2x2s.\nA copy of my presentation at DeCult can be found on substack, link in the show notes. This presentation was written and designed to be used as a resource for 2x2 Truth survivors, so they could share information with therapists, new partners, outsider family and friends. Because the group is so secretive, and resources not easily accessible for survivors, I wanted the DeCult presentation to be available in a digestible, accessible format that could be shared to support survivors and raise awareness of the cult and our lives.\nThere are several books on the Truth 2x2 history which have been published. These are referenced in this podcast and in the DeCult presentation. Im grateful to the authors who\u2019ve written, published and made other resources available. I also want to acknowledge that their historical work underpins the historical information I have shared, in particular Cherie Kropp Erigs work.\nShownotes - Introduction Episode:\nDecult Website: https://decult.net/\nMy presentation at Decult: https://lauramcconnell.substack.com/p/decult-2024-presentation\nPreserving The Truth Book: https://www.amazon.com.au/Preserving-Truth-without-Founder-William\nElizabeth Coleman Book: https://www.amazon.com.au/Cult-Christ-Church-Witness-Doctrine-ebook\nKids book - Little Mouse Purple Door: https://www.amazon.com.au/Little-Mouse-Purple-Meliesa-Tigard\nFBI form: https://forms.fbi.gov/2x2\nLinks to my work:\nSubstack: https://substack.com/@fierceladyfeminist\nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fierceladyfeminist\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/lauramc.au/\nWebsite: https://www.lauramcconnell.com.au/\nLinks to Support:\nGood trauma informed, cult sensitive therapists and support are hard to find.
