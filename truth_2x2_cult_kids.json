      "title": "Standing Strong with Maria Hutchison",
      "description": "Maria Hutchison is a survivor of the Truth 2x2\u0027s from New Zealand. She now lives in Melbourne Australia. She founded With Freedom Coaching, working as an addiction counsellor and coach. She experienced abuse inside Truth 2x2\u0027s, which was swept away and silenced. Maria works with trauma survivors, leveraging her deep lived experience of trauma and recovery. She wrote a book on her experiences and her work, Facing Maria. In this episode Maria shares some of her experiences inside Truth 2x2s, her experience of speaking up about abuse and how it was subsequently silenced for decades. She shares how she spoke with Australian Overseers (lead clergy) about trauma informed care of Truth 2x2 survivors, offering to provide them with support. Sadly, she never heard back from them to take her up on the offer. Maria is generous in her story telling and sharing, humorous and kind. I\u2019m grateful she trusted me (and you) with her story of surviving the Truth 2x2s and building a beautiful life post-leaving.

      "description": "This is an introduction to the Truth 2x2 cult, an overview of group, its history, culture and behaviours.\nThis episode is broadly based on a presentation that I gave at DeCult conference in Christchurch in October 2024. Information about that conference, access to resources and information can be found on the Decult website, which I\u2019d recommend as a good resource for cult survivors in general, not just from the Truth 2x2s.\nA copy of my presentation at DeCult can be found on substack, link in the show notes. This presentation was written and designed to be used as a resource for 2x2 Truth survivors, so they could share information with therapists, new partners, outsider family and friends. Because the group is so secretive, and resources not easily accessible for survivors, I wanted the DeCult presentation to be available in a digestible, accessible format that could be shared to support survivors and raise awareness of the cult and our lives.\nThere are several books on the Truth 2x2 history which have been published. These are referenced in this podcast and in the DeCult presentation. Im grateful to the authors who\u2019ve written, published and made other resources available. I also want to acknowledge that their historical work underpins the historical information I have shared, in particular Cherie Kropp Erigs work.\nShownotes - Introduction Episode:\nDecult Website: https://decult.net/\nMy presentation at Decult: https://lauramcconnell.substack.com/p/decult-2024-presentation\nPreserving The Truth Book: https://www.amazon.com.au/Preserving-Truth-without-Founder-William\nElizabeth Coleman Book: https://www.amazon.com.au/Cult-Christ-Church-Witness-Doctrine-ebook\nKids book - Little Mouse Purple Door: https://www.amazon.com.au/Little-Mouse-Purple-Meliesa-Tigard\nFBI form: https://forms.fbi.gov/2x2\nLinks to my work:\nSubstack: https://substack.com/@fierceladyfeminist\nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fierceladyfeminist\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/lauramc.au/\nWebsite: https://www.lauramcconnell.com.au/\nLinks to Support:\nGood trauma informed, cult sensitive therapists and support are hard to find.
