      "title": "Inside the dark world of Elon Musk\u0027s empire | S\u00F6nke Iwersen interview",
      "description": "S\u00F6nke Iwersen is Head of Investigations at German financial daily Handelsblatt, and co-author of the groundbreaking book \u0022The Tesla Files\u0022. In this wide-ranging conversation, Iwersen takes us deep into the shadows of Elon Musk\u2019s empire\u2014unpacking what may be one of the most significant corporate data leaks in recent history.\n\nAt the centre of the discussion is the Tesla data leak, a trove of confidential internal documents detailing safety complaints, and internal chaos at one of the world\u2019s most hyped car companies. Iwersen reveals how the files came into his possession, what they revealed about the inner workings of Tesla, and the intense global fallout that followed his reporting.\n\nBeyond the leak, the interview explores Elon Musk\u2019s complex role in global politics\u2014from his influence on U.S. policy and space exploration to his chaotic interventions in geopolitics and his flirtation with authoritarian ideologies. Iwersen also touches on Musk\u2019s volatile personal life, cult-like fanbase, and the growing debate over whether the Tesla CEO is a visionary genius\u2014or a dangerously unaccountable mogul.\n\nThis is a must-watch for anyone interested in investigative journalism, the future of electric vehicles, and the murky power dynamics behind Silicon Valley\u2019s most controversial figure.\n\nLike PoliticsJOE?
