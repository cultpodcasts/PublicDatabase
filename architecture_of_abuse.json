Co-Hosts Alyssa Grenfell and veteran attorney Tim Kosnoff are joined by journalist Lisa Davis (The Sins of Brother Curtis), whose investigative work into the Frank Curtis case reveals how systemic silence and deference to Church authority can allow, and sometimes enable, abuse to flourish. Together, they explore how these patterns have persisted and what must change, inviting listeners to examine how tradition, image, and institutional loyalty can contribute to cycles of harm.\n\n\n\n\u26A0\uFE0F This podcast contains discussions about child sexual abuse.

Hosted by Alyssa Grenfell and veteran attorney Tim Kosnoff, and in conversation with clinical therapists, sociologists, historians, journalists, and researchers, we examine the cultural, institutional, and historical forces that enable silence and protect abusers.We aim to equip listeners with a deeper understanding of the scope of this issue, and how abuse can be prevented and addressed, while offering support and resources for survivors\u2014including information about legal representation. Rooted in compassion and a call for accountability, this podcast invites listeners\u2014especially members of the LDS Church\u2014to be part of the movement for meaningful change.",
