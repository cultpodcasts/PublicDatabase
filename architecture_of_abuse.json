      "description": "The influence of the LDS Church in Utah can be traced through its methodical rise throughout history: from desert-settling pioneers to modern-day corporate powerhouse. Attorney Tim Kosnoff, and author and content creator Alyssa Grenfell unpack why the Church\u2019s financial, political, and legal power makes accountability for abuse so elusive in the state of Utah. From the \u201Caccident\u201D of their establishment in the wilderness of the West, to the \u201Cdesign\u201D of the Church\u2019s parallel systems of establishment, Tim and Alyssa detail the undeniable influence of the \u201CMormon Corridor\u201D within the USA.

      "description": "In this exploration of Utah and Church history, co-hosts Alyssa Grenfell and veteran attorney Tim Kosnoff are joined by historian and executive producer Lindsay Hansen Park to trace the LDS Church\u2019s origins through a stark and unflinching lens that reveals how romanticized origins can obscure systemic harm. Together, they examine how secrecy, outlaw theology, and institutional power became woven into the very foundation of the LDS Church and the state of Utah, establishing a blueprint that still shapes the Church\u2019s response to abuse today.\n\n\n\nFrom Joseph Smith\u2019s secret plural marriages to the systemic use of \u201Csacredness\u201D as a shield for silence, Park offers a powerful historical critique, connecting early practices to modern consequences. The episode dissects polygamy, theocratic control, and cultural myths of martyrdom, while exploring how patriarchal reverence and the suppression of discomfort have enabled a long-standing architecture of abuse.\n\n\n\n\u00A0\n\n\n\nEpisode Transcript:\n\n\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1NjOXgop_4F3Nl0CLx2EOIhY9NWzx7HMt/view (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NjOXgop_4F3Nl0CLx2EOIhY9NWzx7HMt/view?usp=sharing) \n\n\n\n\u00A0\n\n\n\nAdditional resources, and a contact form are available at ArchitectureOfAbuse.com (http://ArchitectureOfAbuse.com) \n\n\n\n\u00A0\n\n\n\nListen to Lindsay Hansen Park\u2019s podcast, Year of Polygamy: https://www.yearofpolygamy.com/\n\nListen to Lindsay Hansen Park\u2019s podcast, Sunstone History Podcast: https://sunstone.org/sunstone-history-podcast/\n\n\n\n\u00A0\n\n\n\nContribute to the conversation by:\n\n\n\n\u27A1\uFE0F Following/subscribing to the podcast\n\n\n\n\u27A1\uFE0F Leaving a review/rating\n\n\n\n\u27A1\uFE0F Following https://instagram.com/architectureofabuse and https://tiktok.com/@architectureofabuse\n\n\n\n\u27A1\uFE0F Sharing the podcast with someone who might benefit from these discussions\n\n\n\nAll views expressed are opinions only and do not constitute legal advice.\n\n\n\nEvery case is unique and should be considered and handled on a case-by-case basis.

From standards for clothing and appearances, to the pressure of being \u201Cworthy\u201D, this conversation confronts the Church\u2019s behavioral theology head-on. Featuring insights from therapist Dr. Julie Hanks, sex therapist Natasha Helfer, and expert on undue influence, Dr. Steven Hassan, this deep dive unpacks how scrupulosity, image control, and \u201Cthought-stopping\u201D tactics keep members obedient\u2014and how that shapes a community\u0027s response to trauma.

      "description": "Co-host Tim Kosnoff reconnects with therapist and author Dr. Julie Hanks, who shares an emotional update: after years of faithful participation she has stepped away from activity in the LDS Church. In her own words, Dr. Hanks explains how increasing scrutiny from Church leadership and coordinated complaints from the public made her feel unsafe, unsupported, and ultimately pushed out. Diving into the power dynamics at play when institutions resist critique, Julie reflects on the cost of being \u201Cahead\u201D of the institution, the pain of losing community, the resolve it takes to walk away, and that her work continues with or without institutional approval.\n\n\n\n\u00A0\n\n\n\nEpisode Transcript: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XJB5bi7ZItLRpC47FNs5XM0U-Fc1xAAI/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n\nAdditional resources, and a contact form are available at ArchitectureOfAbuse.com (http://ArchitectureOfAbuse.com) \n\n\n\nLearn more about Dr. Julie Hanks\u2019 work at https://www.drjuliehanks.com/ and follow her on Instagram https://instagram.com/drjuliehanks\n\n\n\n\u00A0\n\n\n\nContribute to the conversation by:\n\n\n\n\uFF1E Following/subscribing to the podcast\n\n\n\n\uFF1E Leaving a review/rating\n\n\n\n\uFF1E Following https://instagram.com/architectureofabuse and https://tiktok.com/@architectureofabuse\n\n\n\n\uFF1E Sharing the podcast with someone who might benefit from these discussions\n\n\n\n\u00A0\n\n\n\nAll views expressed are opinions only and do not constitute legal advice.\n\n\n\nEvery case is unique and should be considered and handled on a case-by-case basis.

In our first Deep Dive, co-hosts Tim Kosnoff and Alyssa Grenfell break down the Church\u2019s internal court structure and disciplinary processes, examining how reporting norms, especially evident within the Church\u0027s missionary program, reinforce silence and control.\n\nFor survivors wondering whether to come forward, Tim offers a powerful reminder: even when no criminal charges are filed, forcing the Church to document your experience creates a permanent record\u2014and that record matters.\n\n\u26A0\uFE0F This podcast contains discussions about child sexual abuse.

      "description": "The first episode of Architecture of Abuse invites listeners into a sobering conversation about the institutional systems that allow child sexual abuse to persist within organizations like The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Co-Hosts Alyssa Grenfell and veteran attorney Tim Kosnoff are joined by journalist Lisa Davis (The Sins of Brother Curtis), whose investigative work into the Frank Curtis case reveals how systemic silence and deference to Church authority can allow, and sometimes enable, abuse to flourish. Together, they explore how these patterns have persisted and what must change, inviting listeners to examine how tradition, image, and institutional loyalty can contribute to cycles of harm.\n\n\n\n\u26A0\uFE0F This podcast contains discussions about child sexual abuse.

      "description": "Architecture of Abuse explores the widespread issue of child sexual abuse in Utah, with a particular focus on how the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has historically responded to reports of abuse within its community. Hosted by Alyssa Grenfell and veteran attorney Tim Kosnoff, and in conversation with clinical therapists, sociologists, historians, journalists, and researchers, we examine the cultural, institutional, and historical forces that enable silence and protect abusers.We aim to equip listeners with a deeper understanding of the scope of this issue, and how abuse can be prevented and addressed, while offering support and resources for survivors\u2014including information about legal representation. Rooted in compassion and a call for accountability, this podcast invites listeners\u2014especially members of the LDS Church\u2014to be part of the movement for meaningful change.",
