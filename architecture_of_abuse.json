      "description": "What happens when abuse, or spiritual sin of any kind, is reported within the private systems of the LDS Church? In our first Deep Dive, co-hosts Tim Kosnoff and Alyssa Grenfell break down the Church\u2019s internal court structure and disciplinary processes, examining how reporting norms, especially evident within the Church\u0027s missionary program, reinforce silence and control.\n\nFor survivors wondering whether to come forward, Tim offers a powerful reminder: even when no criminal charges are filed, forcing the Church to document your experience creates a permanent record\u2014and that record matters.\n\n\u26A0\uFE0F This podcast contains discussions about child sexual abuse.

      "description": "The first episode of Architecture of Abuse invites listeners into a sobering conversation about the institutional systems that allow child sexual abuse to persist within organizations like The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Co-Hosts Alyssa Grenfell and veteran attorney Tim Kosnoff are joined by journalist Lisa Davis (The Sins of Brother Curtis), whose investigative work into the Frank Curtis case reveals how systemic silence and deference to Church authority can allow, and sometimes enable, abuse to flourish. Together, they explore how these patterns have persisted and what must change, inviting listeners to examine how tradition, image, and institutional loyalty can contribute to cycles of harm.\n\n\n\n\u26A0\uFE0F This podcast contains discussions about child sexual abuse.

      "description": "Architecture of Abuse explores the widespread issue of child sexual abuse in Utah, with a particular focus on how the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has historically responded to reports of abuse within its community. Hosted by Alyssa Grenfell and veteran attorney Tim Kosnoff, and in conversation with clinical therapists, sociologists, historians, journalists, and researchers, we examine the cultural, institutional, and historical forces that enable silence and protect abusers.We aim to equip listeners with a deeper understanding of the scope of this issue, and how abuse can be prevented and addressed, while offering support and resources for survivors\u2014including information about legal representation. Rooted in compassion and a call for accountability, this podcast invites listeners\u2014especially members of the LDS Church\u2014to be part of the movement for meaningful change.",
