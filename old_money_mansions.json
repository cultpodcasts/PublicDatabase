Wood who maintained the estate through the 1920s before economics forced subdivision.\n\nJ. Hector McNeal purchased the 73-acre core in 1929, and when his wife died in 1952 executors honored her wish to offer the ch\u00E2teau to Father Divine\u0027s religious movement.\n\nFather Divine purchased Woodmont for $75,000 cash in 1953, consecrating it as \u0022The Mount of the House of the Lord\u0022 on September 10, 1953 and declaring it fulfilled biblical prophecy from Isaiah.\n\nBy the mid-1930s Father Divine\u0027s movement generated an estimated $10,000 weekly in donations with over $15 million in real estate including the Divine Lorraine in Philadelphia purchased in 1948 for $485,000 cash\u2014one of America\u0027s first racially integrated hotels.\n\nOn September 10, 1965 at 2:20 AM Father Divine died in the master bedroom from lung congestion, arteriosclerosis and diabetes at approximately age 89, and his widow Mother Divine assumed leadership for 52 more years.\n\nBetween 1966 and 1970 followers constructed the Shrine to Life housing Father Divine\u0027s body in a bronze coffin, and in 1971 Jim Jones arrived claiming Father Divine\u0027s spirit now resided in his body before Mother Divine ordered him off the property.\n\nMother Divine died in 2017 at age 91, and 18 elderly followers still maintain the 32-room ch\u00E2teau setting Father\u0027s place at the banquet table each morning with fresh flowers on his desk.\n\nThe Alan Wood Steel Company filed for bankruptcy in 1977, and the National Park Service designated Woodmont a National Historic Landmark in 1998 recognizing it as one of the finest ch\u00E2teau-style houses of 1890s America.",
