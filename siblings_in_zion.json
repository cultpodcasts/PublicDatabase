Bryan and Dan have had several fruitful discussions around Faith, Atheism, Christian denominations, biblical literalism, similarities and contrasts in their respective religious experiences, and have have found friendship and comradery in them. So, we gave him an open invite to have one of those discussions on the show. We also welcome our mutual friend Brother Armando, a former Christian who told his story on the previous episode \u2018Confessions of a Former Shi**y Youth Pastor\u2019. We appreciate Bryan\u2019s willingness to express his faith, his vulnerability in sharing his personal experience, and his willingness to recognize the shortcomings in religious organizations and inappropriate applications of personal beliefs. We hope anyone who cares to comment on our discussion will show the same courtesy and respect we show each other. \u2018Instead of coming from the gratitude and the place of - God loves me, and taking that love and sharing that with other people, they beat them over the head with a Bible and say - God hates you!

They compare this larger, more inclusive, more inviting and unifying view of the Christ with the one they grew up with, and those that seem to permeate the modern Christian population. \u0027If the overly personal (even sentimental) Jesus has shown itself to have severe limitations and problems, it is because this Jesus was also not universal. He became cozy and we lost the cosmic. History has clearly shown that worship of Jesus without worship of Christ invariably becomes a time- and culture-bound religion\u0027 - Richard Rohr \u0027I can\u0027t believe what you say, because I see what you do\u0027 - James Baldwin Thank you for joining us this year.

      "description": "The siblings read the first of Ezra Booth\u0027s letters, which were written following his short but notable membership in the LDS church in 1831. He was convinced of Joseph\u0027s prophetship after he witnessed what he considered a miraculous healing. However, after his expectations of further miraculous events and prophecies were unfulfilled, he quickly saw through the delusion he was under and sought to warn others of the deception he witnessed. His story is an example of how one can find themselves needing to reluctantly but honestly face the facts and admit the truth of their misapprehension. This is unfortunately as relevant in our current political atmosphere as it was in the religious fervor of the 19th century. This leads to a conversation about honesty, self-deception, cognitive dissonance, and the conundrum of attempting to live without lying. Sister Lisa provides examples she heard recently about the nature of lying, how more white matter in the brain can be an indication of ones ability to lie more effectively, and how honesty has become more important to her in her post-Mormon life. --- \u0027Mormonism Unvailed\u0027, Signature Books - https://bit.ly/2LS6jaC Elsa Johnson\u0027s healing - https://bit.ly/2J3nGEa Radiolab story \u0027Deception\u0027 - https://bit.ly/3mzC6tq \u0027Lying\u0027 by Sam Harris - https://samharris.org/books/lying/ Latter-day Lesbian podcast - http://latterdaylesbian.org --- Website: siblingsinzion.com Facebook: facebook.com/siblingsinzion Instagram: instagram.com/siblingsinzion Twitter: twitter.com/siblingsinzion YouTube: https://bit.ly/sizyoutube Theme Music: \u0027The Falls\u0027 by Umbrellaman - http://umbrellamanband.com",

In this episode, the siblings intend to speak on the concept of resurrection and the Mormon teachings about it but end up being sidetracked into first talking about the unique take on what happened before we were born (Premortal Life) and what happens while we wait to finally get our body back (Spirit Prison and Spirit Paradise). Along the way they touch on Adam \u0026 Eve in the garden, who were definitely real people in a real place, the Plan of Salvation and how participation in it is essentially a spiritual suicide, Judgement Day, \u2018outer darkness\u2019, and what it could possibly mean to have a \u2018perfect body\u2019. Sister Lisa also shares an inspirational message from Tanner of Zelph on the Shelf about considering mortality after letting go of faith, and how she now views mortal life and conscious experience without religious prescription.

The siblings discuss the act of praying, the mechanics of a Mormon prayer, and interpreting results as God\u0027s answer or the outcome of probability. They also discuss their experiences with prayer as believers, confronting the call to pray as non-believers, the seemingly nonsensical act of praying at all when God already knows all that will happen from beginning to end, and the concept of foreordination. Sister Lisa also describes all the recent positivity in her life, with no help from prayer or tithing blessings, and how unfair it would be to take away from one\u0027s own accomplishments due to their efforts by attributing them to divine intervention or allowance. Eventually, they veer into a debate on the point of the \u0027plan of salvation\u0027 and after getting pretty fired up, they end with the positive results of meditation and compassion for others, and introduce a new segment where they share a passage of uplifting prose that is not traditional scripture. \u0027The power of our prayers depends on us\u0027 - LDS Gospel Topic Essay on Prayer - https://bit.ly/2ZMoAgH \u0027It could have been worse\u0027 ...

How can he be everywhere we want him to be? If you don\u0027t feel his presence, what is wrong with you?! They talk about how they have recognized the spirit both under the banner of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as well as other \u0027holy\u0027 places, and especially in nature. How confirmation bias can confuse and distort one\u0027s search for that feeling.

      "description": "In this first season finale, the siblings further examine the Word of Wisdom - a health code of sorts which was presented to the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1833. Since then, parts of the WoW have been further elaborated and treated more or less as commandments (alcohol, tobacco, hot drinks), while others seem to be overlooked or ignored (meat used sparingly, barley for mild drinks, and wine of your own make). It has continually been a source of confusion for both members and non-members alike. In August of 2019, an attempt at clarification was made in the church publication \u0027New Era\u0027, which is primarily aimed at the Mormon youth. This attempt only further muddied the waters. They elaborate in childish terms that coffee and tea are evil for some unspecified reason. But, with no mention of caffeine, soda and energy drinks are fine? Hot drinks are not for the body, but hot chocolate for all?! And apparently, prescribed marijuana use is acceptable ... After examining all this, they wrap up with their thoughts on the first season of the show, how they are feeling about the church today, and what is in store for the future. Brothers and Sisters, we thank thee for listening to our podcast. We shall return in early 2020 for another season of Siblings in Zion.

Good question. It\u0027s not as creepy as it may sound to the uninitiated, but it\u0027s still creepy. In this episode, the siblings talk about their own experiences being baptized in the name of dead people over and over as adolescents, the significance of being baptized by their father, and feeling the \u0027spirit\u0027 while being dressed in white and surrounded by marble and gold. The list of famous names who have been posthumously baptized into the LDS church may surprise you. They also discuss the invasive questions asked of young people in \u0027worthiness interviews\u0027 before being allowed in the temple, examine arguments for and against the validity of such a practice from the biblical Christian and LDS perspectives, and preview the other weird activities that occur in the temple that will be covered further. --- Website: siblingsinzion.com Facebook: facebook.com/siblingsinzion Instagram: instagram.com/siblingsinzion Twitter: twitter.com/siblingsinzion YouTube: https://bit.ly/sizyoutube",

Lisa joins Brother Dan, Darren McCarthy \u0026 Martin Wallace to share her personal story of growing up in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, being baptized by her brother, attending BYU-Idaho, and serving a full-time mission for 18 months before eventually beginning to question the claims of Joseph Smith, the origins of the Book of Mormon, and the history of the church. She also talks about the structure of missionary life bleeding over after she returned, her struggle to conform to the expectations of women in the church, some of the very weird things she used to believe, and the process of learning and accepting the incompatible truths that would lead her to resign her membership and seek a life of her choosing. --- Website: siblingsinzion.com Facebook: facebook.com/siblingsinzion Instagram: instagram.com/siblingsinzion Twitter: twitter.com/siblingsinzion YouTube: https://bit.ly/sizyoutube Hear more episodes on a variety of interesting subjects from The Fundamentals, now known as Everywhere You Go is Bullsh*t: everywhereyougoisbullshit.com",

They note the hypocrisy of demonizing marijuana while swallowing prescription drugs and diet coke, virtue signaling in the congregations, and spill the tea on when they started swearing as kids and drinking caffeine \u2026 and worse!

Before she came back, she wanted to spend time with the only person she knew who truly understood the struggle and they arranged to spend time in Japan before she returned home.

They were both born \u0026 raised in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, ten years apart. Within the last year, both have found themselves officially resigned as members of record, and now officially apostates! *Let us be clear: we are not \u0027anti-Mormon\u0027 and we do not accept this designation. We are opposed to bad ideas and the behaviors they facilitate. Lisa is a returned missionary, and was much more devout than Dan ever was. After Dan avoided the topic of Mormonism for years on his educational entertainment podcast The Fundamentals (now known as Everywhere You Go is Bullsh*t), he finally decided to dive in and learned all about what he was really supposed to believe, just how much he did not know, and started asking Lisa about the major issues from a believer\u0027s perspective. In this episode we talk about experiences of Mormon gossip, racism, superiority complexes, and the male childhood anxiety of knowing the pressure of serving a mission is building. They also spontaneously break out in hymns. --- Website: siblingsinzion.com Facebook: facebook.com/siblingsinzion Instagram: instagram.com/siblingsinzion Twitter: twitter.com/siblingsinzion YouTube: https://bit.ly/sizyoutube The Fundamentals (now Everywhere You Go is Bullsh*t): everywhereyougoisbullshit.com",
