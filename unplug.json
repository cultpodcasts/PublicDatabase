      "description": "Due to overwhelming evidence of fraud, Platinumships, Rubyships, Emeraldships, \u0026 Diamondships within the Schwers \u0026 Harris team will be set for revocation in the near future. Kevin \u0026 Ameila Schwers; Brent \u0026 Brenda Harris have MULTIPLE high level Amway ranked downline distributers that obtained their rank fraudulently. They violated several consumer laws and Amway\u0027s policies to obtain their Amway ranks. According to Amway rules, that makes all of these ranks void, fraudulent, \u0026 invalid. These downline members will have to repay all of their Amway earnings \u0026 possibly face termination from Amway. In this episode, we expose why high level Amway ranks in the Schwers \u0026 Harris team are fraudulent \u0026 not legitimate. We also brefly discuss the legal counterclaim filed against Schwers \u0026 Harris that will publicly expose their Deceptive Enterprise. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLTD Compensation Plan Exposed, \u0026 All The Information You Will Ever Need On Amway\u0027s Tools Systems: www.unplugltdtools.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUncensored Evidence of LTD Operating Illegally As a RICO Enterprise, \u0026 a Criminal Enterprise: www.youruplineisafelon.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmway Customer Service Phone Number - 1 (800) 253-6500\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIowa State Police Phone Number - 515-294-4428\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIowa Attorney General Phone Number - 1-888-777-4590\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall Ames, IA Panera Bread to Report Unregistered Business Opportunity Solicitation \u0026 Consumer Fraud: \u002B1 515-956-4580\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall Ankeny, IA Panera Bread to Report Unregistered Business Opportunity Solicitation \u0026 Consumer Fraud: \u002B1 515-963-5090\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall Des Moines, IA Panera Bread to Report Unregistered Business Opportunity Solicitation \u0026 Consumer Fraud: \u002B1 515-309-1890\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram Account - https://www.instagram.com/unplug.podcast?igsh=MXAxeWozcWJsamtsaA==\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWanna Reach Out to Me?\n\n\ntomwesten1@gmail.com (mailto:tomwesten1@gmail.com)",
