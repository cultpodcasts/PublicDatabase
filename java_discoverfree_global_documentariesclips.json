In an America in search of meaning, gurus, healers, shamans and other modern wizards have become the new providers of worth.

Meanwhile, in Hollywood, Shaman Durek is adored and charges his disciples nearly $1,000 per hour to attend a seance. However, there is a fine line between a spirituality coach and a professional crook. We follow the comeback of James Arthur Ray, sentenced to ten years in prison when three of his members died during a ceremony, as he re-establishes himself on the spirituality circuit in Las Vegas.\n\nThis documentary was produced by Nova Prod and directed by Flora Desponts \u0026 Gary Grabli.

      "description": "Through the eyes of a group of people convinced that they knew the date of the end of the world, \u2018Right Between Your Ears\u2019 explores how people believe, and how we turn beliefs into certainties and then mistake them for the truth.\n\nMany people have a strong sense that their views are right and couldn\u2019t possibly be wrong. So how do we come to hold an unshakable conviction and why is it hard to consider that we could be mistaken?\n\nA stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student about to graduate and a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years. As they face the consequences of their conviction, neuroscience and social psychology offer insight into how we can become convinced that we\u2019re right, even when we\u2019re wrong.\n\n\u201CA fun and warmhearted look at a community of doomsayers as they face the day of judgment, it ends up saying a great deal about how we all think.\u201D \u2014 Louis Theroux\n\nThis documentary was first released in 2016.\n\n---\n\nSUBSCRIBE for more amazing stories, including free FULL documentaries.
