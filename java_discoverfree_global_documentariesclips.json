      "title": "The Crypto-Currency Cult: Becoming a OneCoin Billionaire Overnight | Documentary",
      "description": "Lie to Me is the story of how tech nerd and blockchain expert Bj\u00F8rn Bjercke overturned the OneCoin pyramid scheme, the biggest Crypto fraud in history. But, more than that, it\u2019s also the story of how and why people keep getting scammed. Why were people so ready to believe in OneCoin and why, even now, do so many refuse to believe it was all a big con? How can we learn to spot the red flags?\n\nOneCoin launched in 2014 with promises to be the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency. But all cryptocurrencies are run on blockchains and OneCoin never had one. Months later, Bjercke was contacted by a recruitment agency and offered a large salary, car and flat in exchange for building a blockchain. The fact that OneCoin was launched without one meant it had to be a scam and Bjercke immediately went public. But other people who were headhunted and offered lucrative positions within the company, who also knew it was a scam, accepted the jobs. Why? What makes one person go along with a fraud and another go public?\n\nBj\u00F8rn\u2019s story is supported by a rich trove of archive material: interviews with fraud victims from Oslo, London, Stockholm and Uganda, experts in crypto and branding, fraud hunters and journalists. Since the fall of OneCoin, Bj\u00F8rn has been working with authorities all over the world to expose new and upcoming frauds, just like OneCoin: \u201CIt\u2019s still the same message. Recruit more members.\u201D\n\nLie to Me is a feature documentary about an ongoing fraud. It explores greed, villains and nerdy heroes, deception, and personal tragedies in both the digital world and real life.\n\nThis documentary was produced by Hacienda Film and directed by B\u00E5r Tyrmi. It was first released in 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBSCRIBE for more amazing stories, including free FULL documentaries.

For Scotland Yard, this discovery sparked the most intensive and most unusual murder investigation ever conducted. Information from a unique police unit, specialising in occult crimes, lead investigators to deduce that the boy had been sacrificed in a ritual murder of a type which, up to this, had been practised predominantly in southern Africa. We follow Scotland Yard\u2019s investigation and investigate the links between the historical, religious and criminological backgrounds to ritual murder.\n\nThis documentary was produced by Occasione Documentaries and directed by Oliver G Becker.

      "description": "The Cargo Cult of Tanna in the South Pacific have been waiting for John Frum for over a hundred years now. \n\nIf you had never heard of an airplane or a refrigerator, would you think it a miracle when you first saw one? When the American military landed on a remote island in the South Pacific during World War II, the islanders were amazed by America\u2019s fantastic cargo - planes, trucks, canned food. They thought such goods could only come from the Gods. Led by the mysterious prophet John Frum, a religion was born.\n\nDavid Attenborough explores a cult devoted to John Frum, an American soldier, known globally as the \u0027Cargo Cult\u0027. The John Frum movement still exists in one village on the island of Vanuatu. \u2018Waiting for John\u2019 explores this extraordinary religion from the perspective of the last villagers as they stuggle to preserve their way of life in the face of outside pressure and internal conflict. In the process, it asks \u2018where do our prophets come from\u2019? And what makes people believe?\n\nThis documentary was produced by  and directed by Jessica Sherry. It was first released in 2015.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nSUBSCRIBE for more amazing stories, including free FULL documentaries.
