      "title": "Epstein Files Released: Survivor Rina Oh Speaks Out In Exclusive Conversation With Times Now",
      "description": "The US Department of Justice has released the first batch of long-pending documents linked to investigations into the criminal activities of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Nearly three lakh pages have been made public following a court-imposed deadline, after months of pressure on US President Donald Trump from both within his party and the opposition.\nThe documents contain very few direct references to Donald Trump. However, former US President Bill Clinton is mentioned repeatedly, along with several global celebrities including Diana Ross, Mick Jagger and Michael Jackson. The files also name other high-profile individuals such as Britain\u2019s Prince Andrew, his former wife Sarah Ferguson, actor Kevin Spacey and British businessman Richard Branson.\nThe Justice Department said the release of the records is expected to shed light on Epstein\u2019s financial links and associations with influential figures. As the disclosures trigger fresh scrutiny, Epstein case survivor Rina OH has spoken out, reacting to the release of the documents and calling for greater accountability in the politically sensitive case.\n#timesnow #englishnews #jeffreyepstein #epsteinfiles #rinaho #usdoj #billclinton #princeandrew #highprofilecase #exclusive\nTimes Now - Times Now News channel examines news with in-depth analysis.
