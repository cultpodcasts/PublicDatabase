      "description": "Imagine if you will, a merging of two *heavy sigh* deeply authentic individuals who in their speaking with each other, of if you will, merging their authenticities, thereby extensively carry on this sort of conversation. And by doing so *wiggles fingers* we get this... this.. series of words, if you will, that describe to us not what we are wanting to know, or care to know, but in doing so, create a, what you may say, is an indiscernible, indescribable sense of boringness that is deeply personal to each of us.\n\nIf we can come to learn why it is that we have this *heavy sigh* unshakable and painful sort of boredom that seems to be so pervasive throughout life and the universe, perhaps we can get more of an essence of what you may call this cult leader and in doing so... *grabs at air* we are thereby able to, to -- *heavy sigh* get a sense of how he was able to bring people in with his speaking and thereby get them to actually give him, what you may say are sort of financial benefits by which he may spend money, as well as reluctantly and sort of, you may say, half-coercivedly agreeing to boink him. *Allison Mack starts crying*.",
