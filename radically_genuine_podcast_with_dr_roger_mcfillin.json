      "description": "Join Elaine Walters as she recounts her journey within the controversial Straight Incorporated, a program claiming to reform teenage drug users through tough love and AA principles. However, the reality was starkly different: with no professional counseling, Straight Incorporated relied on coercive tactics, peer pressure, and mind control to recondition its participants. Elaine sheds light on the absence of adult supervision, the program\u0027s detrimental effects, and her struggle with misdiagnosis and overmedication within the psychiatric system.
