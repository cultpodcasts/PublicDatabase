      "description": "What happens when New Age spirituality, alien messiahs, and fear of technology collide? In this video, we explore the bizarre and unsettling story of the Universe People \u2014 one of the strangest UFO cults you\u0027ve probably never heard of.\n\nLed by Ivo A. Benda, this Czech-based movement claimed to receive telepathic transmissions from space beings, warned followers about digital IDs, barcodes, and vaccines, and promised salvation through galactic ascension.\n\n\uD83C\uDF0C From \u201CAshtar Sheran\u201D to anti-modern conspiracy,\n\uD83D\uDCBB From Cold War fear to 2000s-era internet chaos,\nThis is not just another alien story. This is a cult built on cosmic love... and dangerous paranoia.\n\nHelp Support This Channel, Thanks :) buymeacoffee.com/ZainKarim\n\nBuy my merch! \nhttps://nerdboykarim.creator-spring.com/listing/twin-peaks-postered-apparel",
