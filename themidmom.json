      "description": "In this hilarious and eye-opening episode of The Mid Mom Podcast, host Al Hudson introduces her (totally real, definitely Pulitzer-worthy) book, UR iN A CULT. With her signature wit and no-BS attitude, Al breaks down cult characteristics like love bombing, strict rules, punishments, financial exploitation, isolation, extreme devotion, manipulation, and fear-based control. But here\u2019s the twist\u2014these tactics aren\u2019t just for the Jonestowns and Heavens Gates of the world. Nope! Al makes the case that fan clubs, political parties, multi-level marketing schemes, and even mom groups can have cult-like tendencies (yes, even your local PTA). So grab a Diet Coke, buckle up, and get ready to question everything\u2014including whether you\u2019ve been unknowingly indoctrinated into Swiftie Nation. Oh, and spoiler alert: Al\u0027s planning to drop You\u2019re in a Cult in her store soon. Stay tuned! send me feedback here :) Support the show Subscribe, rate, review, and share with your friends!
