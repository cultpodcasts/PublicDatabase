      "description": "Former staff member and small group leader Skyler T. shares over a decade of his experience at Vine Church in Carbondale, IL inside The Network. Skyler describes how Network leaders craft messages that draw in vulnerable individuals, foster dependency, and inflict harm through manipulative practices. He explores why people join, why they stay, and how the organization systematically strips away agency under the guise of divine purpose. With practical guidance for supporting those inside, Skyler offers insights into reclaiming autonomy and navigating the path to freedom from the Network and similar high-control groups. He suggests reading: \u0022Freedom of Mind, Helping Loved Ones Leave Controlling People, Cults and Beliefs\u0022 by Steven Hassan. https://freedomofmind.com/\n\n\u0022THE NETWORK\u0022 is a high-control group of 25 churches secretly led by STEVEN D.

      "description": "Geneva was a member of High Rock Church in Bloomington, IN, under pastor Scott Joseph when she was in college. She discussed the tactful recruitment strategies used like love bombing. Then she moved with the plant team for Joshua Church in Austin, TX, under pastor \u0026 Network President Steve Morgan, where, among other things, Steve said, \u0022Leaving is shipwrecking your faith\u0022. (Total time in The Network 2013-2022.)\n\nGeneva takes you through her mental health journey, demonstrating enormous courage and generosity in sharing her truth to help prevent others from falling prey to a Network church. Her metaphorical use of a glowstick for her experiences is quite moving \u00228-12 hours of light when you break it, slowly dimming to a lightless piece of plastic\u0022. \n\nShe shares with us from journals she kept in a Network church where she organized her thoughts. She would later learn that the stories we recover are rarely linear because trauma fragments our memories, so keeping journals helped her understand what really happened to her. \n\nGeneva talks about her biggest stumbling block, which is developing a sense of self and having a decent self-concept, and how she\u0027s put a lot of work and resources into surviving this. \n\nWhen the LTN Reddit group started, Geneva said she was one of the first ones there to share her name, not using an anonymous handle. The reason why this matters is how her former pastor Scott Joseph called the people on this site \u0022a toxic cesspool of leeches\u0022 (audio on LeavingTheNetwork.org ) and this really hurt her as he knew exactly who he was speaking about. She advises people to read Ezekiel 34 - where God offers care to those who were hurt by the failings of shepherds \u0026 those in authority positions. \n\nShe finishes by discussing how they taught her to \u0022obey your leader in all things big and small even if he\u0027s wrong\u0022 (audio on LTN) and how ultimately she had to leave after trying to get pastors to help her and treat her well for years. She shared her email with them \u0026 their response was undeniably vacant of all care and concern. They said \u0022We have a clear conscience\u0022 in response to her discussion of suicide.\n\n\u0027THE NETWORK\u0027 is a group of 25 churches secretly led by STEVEN D.

      "description": "Lori\u0027s family joined Foundation Church (formerly called Clear View) in Normal, IL 2010 under pastor Jeff Miller. After Jeff left The Network due to disagreement with Steve Morgan\u0027s leadership, Justin Major became the lead pastor. It was the beginning of the end for Lori as she had realized this church system didn\u0027t have what she needed \u0026 Justin\u0027s leadership was extremely controlling and limiting her growth. She was told by Justin to stop speaking to young women because he didn\u0027t want \u0022triangulation\u0022 and wanted all guidance coming from their small group leaders or him. \n\nLori and her husband left in 2015, but her son (in his 20\u0027s) remained there. Around this time Lori had 1 conversation with her son about why Jeff left the Network leadership. Her son was completely unaware of the deep problems with the Network and she felt his resistance to this topic of conversation so she chose family peace over pushing this any further. She left and the family maintained regular contact for 5 years. \n\nThen 1 year \u0026 3 months ago out of the blue in 2023, her son cut them off via a text. He has not responded to any attempts to discuss what went wrong. Lori contends this act was influenced by Justin Major. Justin had cut his own family off, he was groomed at 19yrs. old to go into leadership and never had any seminary or theological training...like nearly all Network pastors including the Network Leadership Board who oversee them (Steve Morgan, Sandor Paull, Tony Ranvestal, Luke Williams, and James Chidester.) \n\n\u0022Never been in a church that has openly is ok with families being cut off because they dive into these young kids\u0027 business, they get them to confess their issues, and then they use them against the family. There is no biblical precedence for this. How is this ok biblically to cut people off without ever having a conversation or a chance for repentance or reconciliation. The sole purpose is to divide relationships.\u0022 \n\nSadly this story is all too familiar across The Network churches led by Steven D. Morgan. Parents, siblings, entire families, and friends get a text or message saying \u0022I need time to take a break, get space and think about our relationship\u0022. Then they cut all ties. In similar stories, there is often a \u0022let\u0027s FaceTime or I\u0027d like to resolve our issues request\u0022.\n\nShe believes there is an (evil) entity at work here and it\u0027s to seek and destroy the family. \nLori\u0027s story is also published in written format on LeavingTheNetwork.org\n\nNetwork Churches/Locations/Colleges they target:\nVista - San Luis Obispo, CA *Cal Poly UPDATE - CLOSED 9/15/24\nVida Springs - Gainesville, FL *UF......Network board leader Tony Ranvestal \nSouth Grove - Athens, GA *UGA\nBright Field - DeKalb, IL *NIU\nVine Church - Carbondale, IL *SIU\nFoundation - Bloomington-Normal, IL*ISU\nClear River - Lafayette, IN *Purdue\nHigh Rock - Bloomington, IN *IU \u0026 IWU\nOaks - Muncie, IN *BSU\nRock Hills - Bowling Green, KY *WKU\nNorth Pines - Kalamazoo, MI *WMU\nHosea - Raleigh, NC *Duke, UNC-CH \u0026 NCSU\nBrookfield - Athens, OH *OU \u0026 Franklin\nSummit Creek - Eugene, OR *UO \u0026 Bushnell\nValley Springs - Corvallis, OR *OSU\nCedar Heights - State College, PA *PSU\nChristland - College Station, TX *A\u0026M......Network VP Sandor Paull\nJoshua- Austin, TX *UT-Austin, AC \u0026 CTX......Network Pres.

      "description": "Personal testimony of former overseer Andrew of his 17-year history in 3 of Steve Morgan\u0027s \u0027Network\u0027 churches: Vine Church (Carbondale, IL), Blue Sky Church (Bellevue, WA) \u0026 Vista Church (San Luis Obispo, CA). He was a former VP Board of Elders for Blue Sky Church in \u0027The Network\u0027. His wife Torrey was also the bookkeeper at Blue Sky \u0026 where she also managed the \u0027Network\u0027 fund. \n\nHe discusses the leadership systems \u0026 lack of accountability, with specific attention paid to Steve Morgan\u0027s crime abusing a 15-year-old boy.\n\n\u0022Since leaving \u0027The Network\u0027 it\u0027s become evident that 100\u0027s if not 1000\u0027s of people have been negatively impacted by their time in a \u0027Network\u0027 church.\u0022 \n\n\u0022There is belief in extra-biblical doctrine of obeying your leaders in all things. This has come to mean that pastors and leaders tell their followers how to live their lives and expect them to follow without question. Those who do question are pushed out and ostracized. In many cases the pastors advise their followers to cut ties with friends and family members, this sadly results in many broken relationships. Anyone who leaves is also treated as a pariah. This sort of heavy-handed discipleship model has been seen in churches throughout history and was previously called The Shepherding Movement in the 1970-80\u0027s. This movement was resoundingly rebuked by Christians around the world as a dangerous control of individuals.\u0022\n\n\u0027The Network\u0027 is a cult. \n\n\u0027THE NETWORK\u0027 is a group of 25 churches secretly led by STEVEN D.
