      "description": "They call it faith. I call it fatal. Today we dive into the cold, hard truth behind the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 no-blood doctrine\u2014a policy that\u2019s cost tens of thousands of lives and still gets paraded around as a badge of honor. From mothers who bled to death after childbirth to children denied life-saving treatment, this talk uncovers the deadly mix of fear, coercion, and spiritual superiority that fuels one of the religion\u2019s most dangerous teachings. If you think refusing a transfusion is just a \u201Cpersonal choice,\u201D buckle up\u2014we\u2019re about to blow the lid off that myth. Let\u2019s talk about the lives lost, the families shattered, and the Watchtower\u0027s refusal to take any responsibility for its bloody legacy.\n#exjehovahwitness #exjw #cultawareness #jwthink #religiouscontrol #religiousabuse \n\nCitations\nKitchens, C.S.

      "description": "Cults can\u2019t stop talking about sex\u2014but not because they care about your soul. It\u2019s because controlling your sex life is the ultimate power move.\nFrom banning dating and shaming desire, to micromanaging your marriage and silencing abuse\u2014high-control religions have turned sex into a battlefield of guilt, shame, and obedience. And guess who\u2019s always holding the sword? The leadership.\nCults weaponize sexuality\u2014not to protect you, but to own you. We\u2019re talking public humiliation, purity culture on steroids, and the twisted double standards that give predators cover while punishing victims.\nIf you\u2019ve ever been told your body is dirty, your love is wrong, or your desires are dangerous... buckle up. It\u2019s time to burn the shame and reclaim your power.\nBecause it was never about holiness.\n It was always about control.\n#exjw #cultawareness #religiouscontrol",
