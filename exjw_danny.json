      "description": "Here is a breakdown of Chapter 9 from the Jehovah\u2019s Witness elder manual exposes the harsh reality behind the so-called \u201Cprivilege\u201D of pioneering. Beneath the polished smiles and spiritual lingo lies a system of unpaid labor, crushing expectations, and mental burnout. Pioneers are expected to sacrifice financial stability and emotional wellbeing to serve a billion-dollar organization\u2014for free. This isn\u2019t service\u2014it\u2019s spiritual servitude disguised as devotion.\nA big shout-out to AvoidJW for having the files needed for this video\nhttps://files.accessjw.org/s/qPcTw2Hg87t9HXX\n\n#exjw #jehovahwitness #cultawareness",
