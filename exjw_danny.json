      "description": "Chapters 26 and 27 of the elder manual may seem unrelated. Disaster response and weddings, but both reveal the same obsession: control. Whether it\u2019s a natural catastrophe or a walk down the aisle, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are expected to follow rigid protocols that prioritize image and hierarchy over humanity. From keeping the emergency hotline secret to micromanaging wedding playlists and bridal parties, these chapters show that nothing\u2014not even love or loss\u2014escapes organizational oversight.\n\n#jehovah\u0027switnessexposed, #watchtowersociety, #jwgoverningbody, #jwshunning,\r#disfellowshipping, #pimopomipomo, #jwculttactics, #jwdoctrinebreakdown, #exjw,\r#exjehovah\u0027switness, #exjwtestimony, #exjwstory, #exjwexperience, #leavingjehovah\u0027switnesses,\r#lifeafterjw, #exjwtruth, #jehovah\u0027switnessexposed, #watchtowersociety, #jwgoverningbody,\r#jwshunning, #disfellowshipping, #pimopomipomo, #jwculttactics, #jwdoctrinebreakdown",

It\u2019s because controlling your sex life is the ultimate power move.\nFrom banning dating and shaming desire, to micromanaging your marriage and silencing abuse\u2014high-control religions have turned sex into a battlefield of guilt, shame, and obedience. And guess who\u2019s always holding the sword? The leadership.\nCults weaponize sexuality\u2014not to protect you, but to own you. We\u2019re talking public humiliation, purity culture on steroids, and the twisted double standards that give predators cover while punishing victims.\nIf you\u2019ve ever been told your body is dirty, your love is wrong, or your desires are dangerous... buckle up. It\u2019s time to burn the shame and reclaim your power.\nBecause it was never about holiness.\n It was always about control.\n#exjw #cultawareness #religiouscontrol",
