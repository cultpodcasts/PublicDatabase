She makes ser second appearance on The Only One In The Room for this week\u2019s show. Laura and Ronit talk a bit about meeting each other, Ronit\u2019s podcast, and niche podcast communities. Ronit then shares her childhood, growing up on a Kibbutz in Israel and working the fields alongside other children and adults. Ronit recalls her initial thoughts when the October 7th attack happened, and goes on to distinguish the difference between Hamas and Palestinians, as well as the misinformation that comes with labels. After questioning where the hatred of Jewish people come from, Ronit talks about the role that they, and her father, played in the civil rights movement. Ronit and Laura finish the show with a discussion about the possibility of a ceasefire in Gaza, as well as the oppressed vs oppressor narrative that drives many peoples opinions today.
