      "description": "This video series is an unabridged deposition in the Lisa McPherson wrongful death lawsuit against Scientology in 2000.  This deposition is described in the first and second sections as an \u0022emergency\u0022 because Young is suffering from terminal prostate cancer.\r\n\r\nThe result is a fascinating view inside the Scientology organization at all levels, from one of its most trusted officers.\r\n\r\nRobert Vaughn Young (or RVY as he was known online in circles critical of Scientology) was a high ranking church official and eventual whistleblower.  He was married to Stacy Brooks Young (now known as Stacy Brooks), but the pair divorced in the years following their exit from Scientology.\r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia:\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nIN SCIENTOLOGY:\r\n\r\nOf his years with the Church, RVY said:\r\n\r\nI have held nearly every type of position at every echelon. I have worked at the local, the regional, the national and the international levels. I have been a Scientology representative and spokesman before governmental bodies, the media and the courts. I have trained others on how to handle the media and governmental agencies. I have been the most senior public relations executive for Scientology world wide. I worked for years at the echelon that handles critics, \u0022enemies,\u0022 the media, judges, the courts and the government. I have been privy to documents and tactics of the most secret nature, including illegalities committed by Scientology executives and the means of cover-up.[1]\r\n\r\nHe was a national spokesman for the church.[2]\r\n\r\nRVY edited L. Ron Hubbard\u0027s ten-volume Mission Earth series. Young said that Hubbard had written the main text of the series, but that he had ghostwritten the introduction of each volume, as well as other writings in Hubbard\u0027s name.[3][4]\r\n\r\nAFTER LEAVING\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the Church of Scientology in 1989, Young became prominent as an expert in court cases regarding Scientology such as CSI v. Fishman and Geertz,[1] BPI v. FACTNet,[5] the Lisa McPherson civil trial,[6], cited by the press,[7][8] and as an Internet-based critic of the organization. His ex-wife, Stacy Brooks, was a member of the Lisa McPherson Trust. This frequently resulted in tension with his former organization.[9]\r\n\r\nYoung was diagnosed with prostate cancer on November 23, 1999 and turned his energies to Phoenix5, a non-profit organization that runs a website on the disease. He died on June 15, 2003.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nI did video work for Phoenix5, in addition to anti-cult video editing, in the time leading up to RVY\u0027s death; I was honored to have a chance to know him personally, even meeting him for a four hour lunch not long before he died.  It was a long and intimate discussion, and at the risk of being indiscreet, I would like to address a point that - at the time - reputed Scientologists were gleefully parrotting about his marriage.\r\n\r\nDespite the black PR, RVY said that the breakup of his marriage to Stacy Brooks was not precipitated by Bob Minton; he loved Stacy, he said, wanted her to be happy, and considered Bob Minton a friend.  Bob stole nothing from him, he told me; inside a cult, people have a commonality that can form the basis of a lasting relationship.\r\n\r\nOnce that commonality is gone, one can find that the basis itself is in doubt.  People are different outside of a cult than they are inside of it, and maybe something that worked in captivity doesn\u0027t work in the wild.  That\u0027s my metaphor, not his.\r\n\r\nThat\u0027s all the insight he gave me, but it\u0027s enough.\r\n\r\nI didn\u0027t know Robert Vaughn Young very well, but I was grateful for the time and talks we did have.  When our lunch was over, I sat in my car and literally wept for half and hour, because I had barely gotten to know this dynamic, fascinating man, and he was likely to be dead in a few weeks.\r\n\r\nIn fact, nearly a decade later, I\u0027m weeping as I type this.\r\n\r\nI didn\u0027t know him well, and I didn\u0027t know him long, but he left his mark on me - the good ones always do - and I will always miss him.\r\n\r\nRest in peace, RVY.  We\u0027ll take it from here.",

I have trained others on how to handle the media and governmental agencies. I have been the most senior public relations executive for Scientology world wide. I worked for years at the echelon that handles critics, \u0022enemies,\u0022 the media, judges, the courts and the government. I have been privy to documents and tactics of the most secret nature, including illegalities committed by Scientology executives and the means of cover-up.[1]\r\n\r\nHe was a national spokesman for the church.[2]\r\n\r\nRVY edited L.

Fishman and Geertz,[1] BPI v. FACTNet,[5] the Lisa McPherson civil trial,[6], cited by the press,[7][8] and as an Internet-based critic of the organization. His ex-wife, Stacy Brooks, was a member of the Lisa McPherson Trust. This frequently resulted in tension with his former organization.[9]\r\n\r\nYoung was diagnosed with prostate cancer on November 23, 1999 and turned his energies to Phoenix5, a non-profit organization that runs a website on the disease. He died on June 15, 2003.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nI did video work for Phoenix5, in addition to anti-cult video editing, in the time leading up to RVY\u0027s death; I was honored to have a chance to know him personally, even meeting him for a four hour lunch not long before he died.  It was a long and intimate discussion, and at the risk of being indiscreet, I would like to address a point that - at the time - reputed Scientologists were gleefully parrotting about his marriage.\r\n\r\nDespite the black PR, RVY said that the breakup of his marriage to Stacy Brooks was not precipitated by Bob Minton; he loved Stacy, he said, wanted her to be happy, and considered Bob Minton a friend.  Bob stole nothing from him, he told me; inside a cult, people have a commonality that can form the basis of a lasting relationship.\r\n\r\nOnce that commonality is gone, one can find that the basis itself is in doubt.  People are different outside of a cult than they are inside of it, and maybe something that worked in captivity doesn\u0027t work in the wild.  That\u0027s my metaphor, not his.\r\n\r\nThat\u0027s all the insight he gave me, but it\u0027s enough.\r\n\r\nI didn\u0027t know Robert Vaughn Young very well, but I was grateful for the time and talks we did have.  When our lunch was over, I sat in my car and literally wept for half and hour, because I had barely gotten to know this dynamic, fascinating man, and he was likely to be dead in a few weeks.\r\n\r\nIn fact, nearly a decade later, I\u0027m weeping as I type this.\r\n\r\nI didn\u0027t know him well, and I didn\u0027t know him long, but he left his mark on me - the good ones always do - and I will always miss him.\r\n\r\nRest in peace, RVY.

      "description": "This video series is an unabridged deposition in the Lisa McPherson wrongful death lawsuit against Scientology in 2000.  This deposition is described in the first and second sections as an \u0022emergency\u0022 because Young is suffering from terminal prostate cancer.\r\n\r\nThe result is a fascinating view inside the Scientology organization at all levels, from one of its most trusted officers.\r\n\r\nRobert Vaughn Young (or RVY as he was known online in circles critical of Scientology) was a high ranking church official and eventual whistleblower.  He was married to Stacy Brooks Young (now known as Stacy Brooks), but the pair divorced in the years following their exit from Scientology.\r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia:\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nIN SCIENTOLOGY:\r\n\r\nOf his years with the Church, RVY said:\r\n\r\nI have held nearly every type of position at every echelon. I have worked at the local, the regional, the national and the international levels. I have been a Scientology representative and spokesman before governmental bodies, the media and the courts. I have trained others on how to handle the media and governmental agencies. I have been the most senior public relations executive for Scientology world wide. I worked for years at the echelon that handles critics, \u0022enemies,\u0022 the media, judges, the courts and the government. I have been privy to documents and tactics of the most secret nature, including illegalities committed by Scientology executives and the means of cover-up.[1]\r\n\r\nHe was a national spokesman for the church.[2]\r\n\r\nRVY edited L. Ron Hubbard\u0027s ten-volume Mission Earth series. Young said that Hubbard had written the main text of the series, but that he had ghostwritten the introduction of each volume, as well as other writings in Hubbard\u0027s name.[3][4]\r\n\r\nAFTER LEAVING\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the Church of Scientology in 1989, Young became prominent as an expert in court cases regarding Scientology such as CSI v. Fishman and Geertz,[1] BPI v. FACTNet,[5] the Lisa McPherson civil trial,[6], cited by the press,[7][8] and as an Internet-based critic of the organization. His ex-wife, Stacy Brooks, was a member of the Lisa McPherson Trust. This frequently resulted in tension with his former organization.[9]\r\n\r\nYoung was diagnosed with prostate cancer on November 23, 1999 and turned his energies to Phoenix5, a non-profit organization that runs a website on the disease. He died on June 15, 2003.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nI did video work for Phoenix5, in addition to anti-cult video editing, in the time leading up to RVY\u0027s death; I was honored to have a chance to know him personally, even meeting him for a four hour lunch not long before he died.  It was a long and intimate discussion, and at the risk of being indiscreet, I would like to address a point that - at the time - reputed Scientologists were gleefully parrotting about his marriage.\r\n\r\nDespite the black PR, RVY said that the breakup of his marriage to Stacy Brooks was not precipitated by Bob Minton; he loved Stacy, he said, wanted her to be happy, and considered Bob Minton a friend.  Bob stole nothing from him, he told me; inside a cult, people have a commonality that can form the basis of a lasting relationship.\r\n\r\nOnce that commonality is gone, one can find that the basis itself is in doubt.  People are different outside of a cult than they are inside of it, and maybe something that worked in captivity doesn\u0027t work in the wild.  That\u0027s my metaphor, not his.\r\n\r\nThat\u0027s all the insight he gave me, but it\u0027s enough.\r\n\r\nI didn\u0027t know Robert Vaughn Young very well, but I was grateful for the time and talks we did have.  When our lunch was over, I sat in my car and literally wept for half and hour, because I had barely gotten to know this dynamic, fascinating man, and he was likely to be dead in a few weeks.\r\n\r\nIn fact, nearly a decade later, I\u0027m weeping as I type this.\r\n\r\nI didn\u0027t know him well, and I didn\u0027t know him long, but he left his mark on me - the good ones always do - and I will always miss him.\r\n\r\nRest in peace, RVY.

I have trained others on how to handle the media and governmental agencies. I have been the most senior public relations executive for Scientology world wide. I worked for years at the echelon that handles critics, \u0022enemies,\u0022 the media, judges, the courts and the government. I have been privy to documents and tactics of the most secret nature, including illegalities committed by Scientology executives and the means of cover-up.[1]\r\n\r\nHe was a national spokesman for the church.[2]\r\n\r\nRVY edited L.

Young said that Hubbard had written the main text of the series, but that he had ghostwritten the introduction of each volume, as well as other writings in Hubbard\u0027s name.[3][4]\r\n\r\nAFTER LEAVING\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the Church of Scientology in 1989, Young became prominent as an expert in court cases regarding Scientology such as CSI v. Fishman and Geertz,[1] BPI v. FACTNet,[5] the Lisa McPherson civil trial,[6], cited by the press,[7][8] and as an Internet-based critic of the organization. His ex-wife, Stacy Brooks, was a member of the Lisa McPherson Trust. This frequently resulted in tension with his former organization.[9]\r\n\r\nYoung was diagnosed with prostate cancer on November 23, 1999 and turned his energies to Phoenix5, a non-profit organization that runs a website on the disease. He died on June 15, 2003.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nI did video work for Phoenix5, in addition to anti-cult video editing, in the time leading up to RVY\u0027s death; I was honored to have a chance to know him personally, even meeting him for a four hour lunch not long before he died.  It was a long and intimate discussion, and at the risk of being indiscreet, I would like to address a point that - at the time - reputed Scientologists were gleefully parrotting about his marriage.\r\n\r\nDespite the black PR, RVY said that the breakup of his marriage to Stacy Brooks was not precipitated by Bob Minton; he loved Stacy, he said, wanted her to be happy, and considered Bob Minton a friend.  Bob stole nothing from him, he told me; inside a cult, people have a commonality that can form the basis of a lasting relationship.\r\n\r\nOnce that commonality is gone, one can find that the basis itself is in doubt.  People are different outside of a cult than they are inside of it, and maybe something that worked in captivity doesn\u0027t work in the wild.  That\u0027s my metaphor, not his.\r\n\r\nThat\u0027s all the insight he gave me, but it\u0027s enough.\r\n\r\nI didn\u0027t know Robert Vaughn Young very well, but I was grateful for the time and talks we did have.  When our lunch was over, I sat in my car and literally wept for half and hour, because I had barely gotten to know this dynamic, fascinating man, and he was likely to be dead in a few weeks.\r\n\r\nIn fact, nearly a decade later, I\u0027m weeping as I type this.\r\n\r\nI didn\u0027t know him well, and I didn\u0027t know him long, but he left his mark on me - the good ones always do - and I will always miss him.\r\n\r\nRest in peace, RVY.

      "description": "This video series is an unabridged deposition in the Lisa McPherson wrongful death lawsuit against Scientology in 2000.  This deposition is described in the first and second sections as an \u0022emergency\u0022 because Young is suffering from terminal prostate cancer.\r\n\r\nThe result is a fascinating view inside the Scientology organization at all levels, from one of its most trusted officers.\r\n\r\nRobert Vaughn Young (or RVY as he was known online in circles critical of Scientology) was a high ranking church official and eventual whistleblower.  He was married to Stacy Brooks Young (now known as Stacy Brooks), but the pair divorced in the years following their exit from Scientology.\r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia:\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nIN SCIENTOLOGY:\r\n\r\nOf his years with the Church, RVY said:\r\n\r\nI have held nearly every type of position at every echelon. I have worked at the local, the regional, the national and the international levels. I have been a Scientology representative and spokesman before governmental bodies, the media and the courts. I have trained others on how to handle the media and governmental agencies. I have been the most senior public relations executive for Scientology world wide. I worked for years at the echelon that handles critics, \u0022enemies,\u0022 the media, judges, the courts and the government. I have been privy to documents and tactics of the most secret nature, including illegalities committed by Scientology executives and the means of cover-up.[1]\r\n\r\nHe was a national spokesman for the church.[2]\r\n\r\nRVY edited L. Ron Hubbard\u0027s ten-volume Mission Earth series. Young said that Hubbard had written the main text of the series, but that he had ghostwritten the introduction of each volume, as well as other writings in Hubbard\u0027s name.[3][4]\r\n\r\nAFTER LEAVING\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the Church of Scientology in 1989, Young became prominent as an expert in court cases regarding Scientology such as CSI v. Fishman and Geertz,[1] BPI v. FACTNet,[5] the Lisa McPherson civil trial,[6], cited by the press,[7][8] and as an Internet-based critic of the organization. His ex-wife, Stacy Brooks, was a member of the Lisa McPherson Trust. This frequently resulted in tension with his former organization.[9]\r\n\r\nYoung was diagnosed with prostate cancer on November 23, 1999 and turned his energies to Phoenix5, a non-profit organization that runs a website on the disease. He died on June 15, 2003.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nOne day, I received a call from Stacy Brooks, and shortly afterward I began doing video work for Phoenix5, in addition to anti-cult video editing.  This was my first contact with RVY.\r\n\r\nI was honored to have a chance to know him personally, even meeting him for a four hour lunch not long before he died.  It was a long and intimate discussion, and at the risk of being indiscreet, I would like to address a point that - at the time - reputed Scientologists were gleefully parrotting about his marriage.\r\n\r\nDespite the black PR, RVY said that the breakup of his marriage to Stacy Brooks was not precipitated by Bob Minton; he loved Stacy, he said, wanted her to be happy, and considered Bob Minton a friend.  Bob stole nothing from him, he told me; inside a cult, people have a commonality that can form the basis of a lasting relationship.\r\n\r\nOnce that commonality is gone, one can find that the basis itself is in doubt.  People are different outside of a cult than they are inside of it, and maybe something that worked in captivity doesn\u0027t work in the wild.  That\u0027s my metaphor, not his.\r\n\r\nThat\u0027s all the insight he gave me, but it\u0027s enough.\r\n\r\nI didn\u0027t know Robert Vaughn Young very well, but I was grateful for the time and talks we did have.

Some of his \u0022out there\u0022 statements seem to be keeping in line with things I have learned about Scientology practices and indoctriation, while other comments make me wonder if an intervention wouldn\u0027t have made more sense, with anti-psychotic drugs.  Lots of antipsychotic drugs.\r\n\r\nThen I checked the background on the piece and realized that this is the 7-part interview Fishman\u0027s attorney arranged in the following Wikipedia.org quote:\r\n\r\n\u0022Fishman\u0027s attorney, Marc Nurik, had planned to use an insanity defense [against charges of fraud], offering false memory syndrome theorist Richard Ofshe and psychologist Margaret Singer as expert witnesses.[3] Fishman sat for a seven-part videotaped interview with Ofshe and Nurik. In the interview, he discussed in detail various aspects of Scientology doctrine, his own Scientology involvement, and the church\u0027s response to his arrest. Fishman claimed that church staff had ordered him to murder his psychologist, Uwe Geertz, who had knowledge of his Scientology involvement, and then to commit suicide.[1]\u0022\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nWhy is Fishman So Important?\r\n\r\nAlso from Wikipedia: \u0022In support of his contention that he had been brainwashed and ordered to murder Geertz, Fishman attached a series of documents to a motion to reconsider venue. This filing has since become known as the Fishman Affidavit. It included purported Scientology documents describing obstructionist tactics to use in the event of an arrest, as well as versions of Operating Thetan levels I through VII and purported excerpts of OT VIII. Fishman\u0027s filing placed the advanced materials on record at the district court, available for viewing by the general public. Despite an unsuccessful church motion to seal the court record and efforts to keep the court files continuously checked out, former Scientologist Arnaldo Lerma obtained the affidavit and posted it on the internet, after which it spread uncontrollably. In the process of suing Lerma for copyright infringement, the church confirmed that the copies of levels I through VII were accurate.\u0022\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nSo there you have it.

Without Steve Fishman, there would likely be no Xenu story floating around the Internet for people to read and then sit back in shock as they contemplated the sheer lunacy of the story.  The words \u0022Xenu,\u0022 \u0022Teegeeack,\u0022 and \u0022Body Thetan\u0022 would not have entered popular parlance, and yes, Trey Parker and Matt Stone would not have had the opportunity to delight in posting a parody of the Xenu story on their television show \u0022South Park\u0022 for the world to digest and be stunned by.\r\n\r\nHow much of what Fishman says is a self-serving attempt to sway the judge into believing he is not guilty by insanity is an opinion you\u0027ll need to form yourself.\r\n\r\nHow much of what Fishman says is true insanity, again, will have to be your own opinion to form.\r\n\r\nAnd as for how much is an accurate portrayal of a man who has spent years and hundreds of thousands of dollars absorbing and praciting the teachings of the Church of Scientology, once agan, will be a matter for you to decide.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I find the man to be a criminal who is deluded at best; his credibility is suspect, but I do not believe that there isn\u0027t some relevant information to be gleaned from this interview.

Fishman claimed that church staff had ordered him to murder his psychologist, Uwe Geertz, who had knowledge of his Scientology involvement, and then to commit suicide.[1]\u0022\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nWhy is Fishman So Important?\r\n\r\nAlso from Wikipedia: \u0022In support of his contention that he had been brainwashed and ordered to murder Geertz, Fishman attached a series of documents to a motion to reconsider venue. This filing has since become known as the Fishman Affidavit. It included purported Scientology documents describing obstructionist tactics to use in the event of an arrest, as well as versions of Operating Thetan levels I through VII and purported excerpts of OT VIII. Fishman\u0027s filing placed the advanced materials on record at the district court, available for viewing by the general public. Despite an unsuccessful church motion to seal the court record and efforts to keep the court files continuously checked out, former Scientologist Arnaldo Lerma obtained the affidavit and posted it on the internet, after which it spread uncontrollably. In the process of suing Lerma for copyright infringement, the church confirmed that the copies of levels I through VII were accurate.\u0022\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nSo there you have it.

Without Steve Fishman, there would likely be no Xenu story floating around the Internet for people to read and then sit back in shock as they contemplated the sheer lunacy of the story.  The words \u0022Xenu,\u0022 \u0022Teegeeack,\u0022 and \u0022Body Thetan\u0022 would not have entered popular parlance, and yes, Trey Parker and Matt Stone would not have had the opportunity to delight in posting a parody of the Xenu story on their television show \u0022South Park\u0022 for the world to digest and be stunned by.\r\n\r\nHow much of what Fishman says is a self-serving attempt to sway the judge into believing he is not guilty by insanity is an opinion you\u0027ll need to form yourself.\r\n\r\nHow much of what Fishman says is true insanity, again, will have to be your own opinion to form.\r\n\r\nAnd as for how much is an accurate portrayal of a man who has spent years and hundreds of thousands of dollars absorbing and praciting the teachings of the Church of Scientology, once agan, will be a matter for you to decide.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I find the man to be a criminal who is deluded at best; his credibility is suspect, but I do not believe that there isn\u0027t some relevant information to be gleaned from this interview.

      "description": "I have wrestled with writing a disclaimer regarding Steve Fishman and this interview, and it\u0027s been a struggle.  Much of what he says is extremely \u0022out there\u0022.  Some of his \u0022out there\u0022 statements seem to be keeping in line with things I have learned about Scientology practices and indoctriation, while other comments make me wonder if an intervention wouldn\u0027t have made more sense, with anti-psychotic drugs.  Lots of antipsychotic drugs.\r\n\r\nThen I checked the background on the piece and realized that this is the 7-part interview Fishman\u0027s attorney arranged in the following Wikipedia.org quote:\r\n\r\n\u0022Fishman\u0027s attorney, Marc Nurik, had planned to use an insanity defense [against charges of fraud], offering false memory syndrome theorist Richard Ofshe and psychologist Margaret Singer as expert witnesses.[3] Fishman sat for a seven-part videotaped interview with Ofshe and Nurik. In the interview, he discussed in detail various aspects of Scientology doctrine, his own Scientology involvement, and the church\u0027s response to his arrest. Fishman claimed that church staff had ordered him to murder his psychologist, Uwe Geertz, who had knowledge of his Scientology involvement, and then to commit suicide.[1]\u0022\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nWhy is Fishman So Important?\r\n\r\nAlso from Wikipedia: \u0022In support of his contention that he had been brainwashed and ordered to murder Geertz, Fishman attached a series of documents to a motion to reconsider venue. This filing has since become known as the Fishman Affidavit. It included purported Scientology documents describing obstructionist tactics to use in the event of an arrest, as well as versions of Operating Thetan levels I through VII and purported excerpts of OT VIII. Fishman\u0027s filing placed the advanced materials on record at the district court, available for viewing by the general public. Despite an unsuccessful church motion to seal the court record and efforts to keep the court files continuously checked out, former Scientologist Arnaldo Lerma obtained the affidavit and posted it on the internet, after which it spread uncontrollably. In the process of suing Lerma for copyright infringement, the church confirmed that the copies of levels I through VII were accurate.\u0022\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nSo there you have it.  Admist that wall of text is the man responsible to securing and filing Scientology\u0027s secret upper levels, which were later copied and pasted to the Internet.  Without Steve Fishman, there would likely be no Xenu story floating around the Internet for people to read and then sit back in shock as they contemplated the sheer lunacy of the story.  The words \u0022Xenu,\u0022 \u0022Teegeeack,\u0022 and \u0022Body Thetan\u0022 would not have entered popular parlance, and yes, Trey Parker and Matt Stone would not have had the opportunity to delight in posting a parody of the Xenu story on their television show \u0022South Park\u0022 for the world to digest and be stunned by.\r\n\r\nHow much of what Fishman says is a self-serving attempt to sway the judge into believing he is not guilty by insanity is an opinion you\u0027ll need to form yourself.\r\n\r\nHow much of what Fishman says is true insanity, again, will have to be your own opinion to form.\r\n\r\nAnd as for how much is an accurate portrayal of a man who has spent years and hundreds of thousands of dollars absorbing and praciting the teachings of the Church of Scientology, once agan, will be a matter for you to decide.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I find the man to be a criminal who is deluded at best; his credibility is suspect, but I do not believe that there isn\u0027t some relevant information to be gleaned from this interview.  I\u0027m not really sure now much truth we can glean from a man who claims he is \u0022Jesus Christ, but further down the time track\u0022 and is going to \u0022Clear the planet for L. Ron Hubbard.\u0022\r\n\r\nYour mileage, however, may vary.

      "description": "I have wrestled with writing a disclaimer regarding Steve Fishman and this interview, and it\u0027s been a struggle.  Much of what he says is extremely \u0022out there\u0022.  Some of his \u0022out there\u0022 statements seem to be keeping in line with things I have learned about Scientology practices and indoctriation, while other comments make me wonder if an intervention wouldn\u0027t have made more sense, with anti-psychotic drugs.  Lots of antipsychotic drugs.\r\n\r\nThen I checked the background on the piece and realized that this is the 7-part interview Fishman\u0027s attorney arranged in the following Wikipedia.org quote:\r\n\r\n\u0022Fishman\u0027s attorney, Marc Nurik, had planned to use an insanity defense [against charges of fraud], offering false memory syndrome theorist Richard Ofshe and psychologist Margaret Singer as expert witnesses.[3] Fishman sat for a seven-part videotaped interview with Ofshe and Nurik. In the interview, he discussed in detail various aspects of Scientology doctrine, his own Scientology involvement, and the church\u0027s response to his arrest. Fishman claimed that church staff had ordered him to murder his psychologist, Uwe Geertz, who had knowledge of his Scientology involvement, and then to commit suicide.[1]\u0022\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nWhy is Fishman So Important?\r\n\r\nAlso from Wikipedia: \u0022In support of his contention that he had been brainwashed and ordered to murder Geertz, Fishman attached a series of documents to a motion to reconsider venue. This filing has since become known as the Fishman Affidavit. It included purported Scientology documents describing obstructionist tactics to use in the event of an arrest, as well as versions of Operating Thetan levels I through VII and purported excerpts of OT VIII. Fishman\u0027s filing placed the advanced materials on record at the district court, available for viewing by the general public. Despite an unsuccessful church motion to seal the court record and efforts to keep the court files continuously checked out, former Scientologist Arnaldo Lerma obtained the affidavit and posted it on the internet, after which it spread uncontrollably. In the process of suing Lerma for copyright infringement, the church confirmed that the copies of levels I through VII were accurate.\u0022\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nSo there you have it.  Admist that wall of text is the man responsible to securing and filing Scientology\u0027s secret upper levels, which were later copied and pasted to the Internet.  Without Steve Fishman, there would likely be no Xenu story floating around the Internet for people to read and then sit back in shock as they contemplated the sheer lunacy of the story.  The words \u0022Xenu,\u0022 \u0022Teegeeack,\u0022 and \u0022Body Thetan\u0022 would not have entered popular parlance, and yes, Trey Parker and Matt Stone would not have had the opportunity to delight in posting a parody of the Xenu story on their television show \u0022South Park\u0022 for the world to digest and be stunned by.\r\n\r\nHow much of what Fishman says is a self-serving attempt to sway the judge into believing he is not guilty by insanity is an opinion you\u0027ll need to form yourself.\r\n\r\nHow much of what Fishman says is true insanity, again, will have to be your own opinion to form.\r\n\r\nAnd as for how much is an accurate portrayal of a man who has spent years and hundreds of thousands of dollars absorbing and praciting the teachings of the Church of Scientology, once agan, will be a matter for you to decide.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I find the man to be a criminal who is deluded at best; his credibility is suspect, but I do not believe that there isn\u0027t some relevant information to be gleaned from this interview.  I\u0027m not really sure now much truth we can glean from a man who claims he is \u0022Jesus Christ, but further down the time track\u0022 and is going to \u0022Clear the planet for L. Ron Hubbard.\u0022\r\n\r\nYour mileage, however, may vary.  I do not wish to debate validity; I am offering this video for the sake of being a completist.  \r\n\r\nThus video is being offered for educational purposes only.  No infringement is intended.",

I\u0027m not really sure now much truth we can glean from a man who claims he is \u0022Jesus Christ, but further down the time track\u0022 and is going to \u0022Clear the planet for L. Ron Hubbard.\r\n\r\nYour mileage, however, may vary.  I do not wish to debate validity; I am offering this video for the sake of being a completist.  \r\n\r\nThus video is being offered for educational purposes only.  No infringement is intended.",
