His so-called \u0022apostasy\u0022 resulted when he dared to counsel the incipient Governing Body back in 1979 about the need to take responsibility and apologize for misleading the congregation of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses worldwide over the 1975 end-of-the-world teaching.  He also scripturally challenged the teaching that the preaching work had to be done from door to door.  For this, he was harassed and hounded until finally, they disfellowshipped him.  As a result, about 80 Witnesses left the religion\u2014about a third of all those in Lethbridge, Alberta\u2014to worship God in line with real Bible truth.  The account of all that transpired in 1979/80 can be found in the book \u0022Crisis of Allegiance - A Study of Dissent Among Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses\u0022.\n\nThis is a link to the Golden Age article libeling Walter F.

F. RUTHERFORD REJECTS HOLY SPIRIT IN FAVOR OF ANGELIC REVELATION\n\u0022While Jesus was absent from them, and while he is engaged in \u2018preparing the way before the Lord\u2019 and before he comes to his temple, the holy spirit operates as an advocate, helper and comforter of and for all that have responded to the call for the kingdom. But when the Lord comes to his temple and gathers his approved ones into the temple, is there any further need for the office of the holy spirit as a helper or advocate? If not, then the advocacy of the holy spirit would there cease. Jesus, being in the temple and with his chosen ones, would act for them directly.\n\n... now the Lord Jesus himself has returned, is in his temple, and, acting by and through his holy angels, puts it into the mind and heart of the remnant class to take positive action and to do a certain work;\u0022 Watchtower 1930 Sep 1 pp;262-263\n\u0022With the coming of the Lord to his temple and the gathering together unto himself of the chosen ones the holy spirit would there cease to function as a paraclete or advocate for the church. ... After the holy spirit as an advocate or paraclete ceased to function in behalf of the consecrated, then the angels are employed in behalf of those who are being made ready for the kingdom.\u0022 Watchtower 1930 Jun 1 pp.166,167\n\u0022God uses angels to teach His people now on earth.\u0022 The Golden Age 1933 Nov 8 p.69\n\u0022Certain duties and kingdom interests have been committed by the Lord to his angels, which include the transmission of information to God\u0027s anointed people on the earth for their aid and comfort. Even though we cannot understand how the angels transmit this information, we know that they do it.\u0022 Preparation (1933) pp.36,37\n\u0022Enlightenment proceeds from Jehovah... and is given to the faithful anointed.... the remnant are instructed by the angels of the Lord. The remnant do not hear audible sounds, because such is not necessary. Jehovah has provided his own good way to convey thoughts to the minds of his anointed ones.\u0022 Preparation (1933) p.64\n\u0022Judge Rutherford couldn\u0027t write these things unless he were used of God\u0022. Golden Age 1935 Oct 23 p.50\n\u0022No man can properly interpret prophecy, and the Lord sends his angels to transmit correct information to his people.\u0022 Watchtower 1936 Feb 15 p.52\n\nTo view a transcript of this video, go to: https://beroeans.net/2019/10/25/examining-matthew-24-part-3-preaching-in-all-the-inhabited-earth/\n\nTo view all the Beroean Pickets videos, click on this link:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1l1Ac6tb16thxKa96Gm7XA\n\nIf you would like to help us to continue in this work, click this link: https://beroeans.net/support/",

There is a valuable lesson to be learned concerning the true nature and purpose of the JW judicial system as evinced in this exchange between two different committees of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses elders and a lone exJW.  By not being able to allow me to simply go away, they have provided a perfect opportunity to expose the wickedness of their so-called judicial process and show it up to be what is it, a modern reworking of the catholic inquisition of the Dark Ages.\n\nTo download the lawyer\u0027s letter to the Aldershot judicial committee, go here: https://beroeans.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Lawyer-Letter.pdf \n\nTo download the final appeal letter to the Canada branch office of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, go here: https://beroeans.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Appeal-to-Branch.pdf\n\nTo view all the Beroean Pickets videos, click on this link:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1l1Ac6tb16thxKa96Gm7XA\n\nIf you would like to help us to continue in this work, click this link: https://beroeans.net/support/",
