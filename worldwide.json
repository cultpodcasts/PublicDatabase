      "title": "Ep 1.7: Finding Bobby Fischer: Lost Interviews with the World Chess Champion (Worldwide: The Unchosen Church)",
      "description": "Bobby Fischer was the Muhammad Ali of chess. He became the youngest person to ever win the US chess championship at the age of 14 and the only American-born player to ever win the World Chess Championship. But after defeating the Soviet Boris Spassky in 1972, Bobby Fischer never played another professional match for over twenty years. Instead, he became a recluse, preferring privacy over prize money.\u00A0 Not much is known about Bobby\u2019s life after his 1972 win, but this episode premieres newly discovered tapes of Fischer, discussing his time in the Worldwide Church of God \u2013 the doomsday apocalyptic cult this series is devoted to.In these tapes, which were made in Dec 1976 and Jan 1977,\u00A0 Bobby discusses his views on god, sex, and chess and, especially,\u00A0 how he came to resent Herbert W. Armstrong and his son Garner Ted, the church\u2019s leaders.\u00A0 These tapes provide a riveting snapshot of Bobby\u2019s mental state during the time when he had essentially disappeared from public view and has great crossover appeal between those interested in cults and those interested in chess. The original tapes were about 5 hours long, and the best highlights are featured in this 30\u002B minute episode, which also features commentary from David Edmonds, co-author of Bobby Fischer Goes to War. I would like to extend a special thank you to David Edmonds, Bill Hughes, and Dixon Cartwright for their commentary in this episode, and to Hughes and Margaret and Len Zola for speaking to me on background about these tapes.If you would like to read the Ambassador Report interview with Bobby that is mentioned in this episode online, you can check it out here: https://hwarmstrong.com/ambassador.report/ambassador/ar2.htmlIf you would like to support Worldwide: The Unchosen Church, you can tell us to host it or toast it.\u00A0 Support will go to either hosting this show on Buzzsprout so others can find it for years to come (host it), or if you just want to appreciate the show, tell us to toast it and our team will gladly drink a beer and cheers to you.

      "description": "DJ Grothe is the former host of the Point of Inquiry and For Good Reason podcasts and the past president of the James Randi Educational Foundation.\u00A0 While he has interviewed hundreds of skeptic and scientific leaders, he rarely tells his own story of how he attended a little Bible college in the piney woods of East Texas, called Ambassador University.\u00A0 In this episode, I sit down to ask DJ why he joined the Worldwide Church of God - a biblical cult - when he was 14 years old - the same year that he came out as gay and the same year he started getting into magic. We also talk about how his background in magic and a magazine housed in Ambassador University\u0027s library helped to lead him out of the doomsday apocalyptic cult he had once joined, and why today, he says he\u0027s grateful for the entire experience.While this podcast is a labor of love, if you\u0027d like to support Worldwide: The Unchosen Church, we would gladly accept\u00A0 a coffee or beer: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/worldwidepodHosted, written and produced by Dr. Tricia Jenkins.\u00A0 Sound design and editing by Thirteen Media.Instagram @worldwidepodFacebook and Twitter: @worldwidepod11Email: Worldwidepod11@gmail.com",
