      "title": "How I became a brainwashed cult bride",
      "description": "Liz Cameron was 18 years old when a stranger approached her in a book shop. It was the beginning of her induction into a cult, and it was an experience Liz barely survived. The process of brainwashing happened gradually, first came the love-bombing and the allure of finding a new purpose in life. Then came the isolation from friends and family, along with sleep deprivation, overwork and sexual manipulation. Liz was one of the many women chosen to become a kind of bride for the leader of an infamous Korean religious group. It wasn\u2019t until she became critically ill, that her family were able to get the help she needed to escape and to begin the process of being deprogrammed. Liz Cameron\u2019s memoir is called Cult Bride: How I was brainwashed and how I broke free. Find out more about the Conversations Live National Tour on the ABC website.
