      "description": "PART 1 IS LIVE Today\u0027s a doozy of an interview! I spoke with the fabulous Amanda Graham about so many things including but not limited to, her cult experience, her relationship with religion and spirituality, and her experience as an autistic woman. Amanda\u0027s story grabbed me right away, not only with an interesting past, but also what she\u0027s been able to do with it as an adult. We also dive into working in TV production and comedy, and how she managed to navigate barriers while existing on the spectrum. As an interviewer, I was moved by this conversation. Amanda represents a lot of what I\u0027m interested in accomplishing with my own life and I greatly admire her as a role model to inspire me and I hope you feel inspired as a listener. Thank you for being here, thank you Amanda.
