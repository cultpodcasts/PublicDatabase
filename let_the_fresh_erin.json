This video explores the cult\u2019s origins, practices, and the devastating consequences of its leaders\u2019 paranoia and delusions.

      "description": "In this video, we dive into the secretive and controversial world of the 12 Tribes\u2014a religious cult known for its strict control over followers, intense discipline, and isolated lifestyle. Founded by Eugene Spriggs in the 1970s, the 12 Tribes created a system where obedience was paramount, from daily routines to deeply personal choices, leaving members with little freedom or independence. Children faced harsh discipline and rigid upbringing, while adults endured intense oversight, limited expression, and rigid gender roles.\n\nThe 12 Tribes used businesses like the Yellow Deli as recruitment tools and means of control, with members working long, unpaid hours, cut off from mainstream society. For those who escaped, the journey was far from easy. Leaving often meant abandoning everything, from family and finances to the only world they\u2019d ever known. Former members describe the overwhelming challenges of reintegrating into society, rebuilding their identities, and coping with deep-seated psychological scars. This video tells the story of those who managed to break free and offers insight into the ongoing impact of life within the 12 Tribes.
