      "description": "He calls his fans a cult \u2013 and they wear it like a badge. Jared Leto, an Oscar-winning actor turned rock frontman, has built a fanbase so devout that it\u2019s drawn comparisons to a religious cult. Clad in white robes on a private island, Leto addressed hundreds of followers in scenes eerily reminiscent of a spiritual retreat, even captioning one 2019 photo, \u201CYes, this is a cult.\u201D\n\n In truth, these fans call themselves The Echelon, a tight-knit community around Leto\u2019s band Thirty Seconds to Mars \u2013 a group the band itself once cheerfully described as \u201Ca cult\u201D from early on\n\n. How did a Hollywood star\u2019s rock band inspire such fervent, cult-like devotion? This video goes behind the sensational headlines and viral images to find out.\n\nToday, we delve into Thirty Seconds to Mars\u2019 unusual journey from its formation in 1998 to the creation of an obsessive fan community. We explore the band\u2019s early days and the rise of the Echelon fan culture, including the symbolic slogans and cult imagery (like the now-infamous \u201CYes, this is a cult\u201D tagline) that Leto and his brother Shannon wove into their music and merch\n\nYou\u2019ll see how these immersive events and rituals fueled the \u201Ccult\u201D reputation, and hear how media coverage amplified the mystique (with headlines dubbing Leto a real-life cult leader). We also compare the Echelon\u2019s structure and us-vs-them mentality with bona fide cults, asking where the line blurs between an ardent fan community and a cult of personality. Finally, the film reveals Jared Leto\u2019s response to the cult allegations \u2013 including his insistence that it\u2019s all an inside joke\n \u2013 and invites you to decide just how far is too far when fandom turns fanatic. Join us as we uncover the truth behind the hype, exposing the fine line between passionate fandom and the cult of Mars.\n\nChapters\n\n0:00 Introduction \u2013 A shocking look at Jared Leto\u2019s band and its cult-like fanbase\n\n3:00 Band Formation \u0026 Early Years \u2013 From Hollywood actor to rock frontman: how Thirty Seconds to Mars began\n\n8:00 Rise of the Echelon \u2013 The emergence of an intense fan community and its unique culture\n\n14:00 \u0022Yes, This Is a Cult\u0022 Slogan \u0026 Symbolism \u2013 The band\u2019s use of cult-like imagery, slogans, and insider language\n\n20:00 Camp Mars Fan Retreats \u2013 Summer camp gatherings that brought fans closer and blurred fan-idol boundaries\n\n27:00 Mars Island Controversy \u2013 Inside the 2019 Croatian island retreat that sparked headlines of a \u201Crock cult\u201D\nkqed.org\n\n34:00 Media Coverage \u0026 Public Reaction \u2013 How press and social media responded to Thirty Seconds to Mars\u2019 cult reputation\n\n40:00 Cult vs. Fandom \u2013 Comparing the Echelon\u2019s devotion and structure to actual cults, and the psychology of fanatical loyalty\n\n46:00 Jared Leto\u2019s Response \u0026 Aftermath \u2013 Leto\u2019s own explanation of the \u201Ccult\u201D label, the band\u2019s stance, and closing thoughts on the fine line between fan culture and cult culture\n\nDISCLAIMER: This video is for entertainment purposes only.
