      "title": "Killer Yoga - The Doomsday Cult of Aum Shinrikyo",
      "description": "You normally associate yoga with love and light, but what started out as a peaceful path to spiritual enlightenment turned into a horrific doomsday cult when Shoko Asahara founded the religious group \u0022Aum Shinrikyo\u0022 in Japan in the 1980\u0027s. Today, we explore how a charismatic and manipulative man was able to convince his followers to perform the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin gas attack, leaving Japan, and the rest of the world, both shocked and horrified.
