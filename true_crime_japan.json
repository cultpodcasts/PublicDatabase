      "description": "In this video, we dive deep into the disturbing story of JMS (Jesus Morning Star) \u2014 a South Korean religious sect led by Jung Myung-seok, who proclaimed himself the Messiah and manipulated his followers with a twisted doctrine. He convinced young women that they were \u201CGod\u2019s brides\u201D, brainwashed them through love-bombing, and used his supposed spiritual authority to sexually exploit them.\n\nJung was first convicted in 2008 for rape, served 10 years in prison, and was released in 2018. But his crimes didn\u2019t stop there: between 2018 and 2021, he allegedly sexually assaulted more female followers at his cult\u2019s headquarters in Wolmyeongdong. In 2023, the court handed him a 23-year prison sentence.\n\n#JMS #Cult #TrueCrime #Korea #ReligiousAbuse #JesusMorningStar #ProvidenceCult\u0022",
