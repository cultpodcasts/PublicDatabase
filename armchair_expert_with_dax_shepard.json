I am endlessly fascinated by the messiness of being human, and I find people who are vulnerable and honest about their struggles and shortcomings to be incredibly sexy. I invite you to join me as I explore other people\u2019s stories. We will celebrate, above all, the challenges and setbacks that ultimately lead to growth and betterment. What qualifies me for such an endeavor? More than a decade of sobriety, a degree in Anthropology and four years of improv training. I will attempt to discover human \u201Ctruths\u201D without any laboratory work, clinical trials or data collection. I will be, in the great tradition of 16th-century scientists, an Armchair Expert.\n\nWatch Armchair Expert every MONDAY, WEDNESDAY, and FRIDAY here on Youtube!\n\nListen to episodes ad-free by joining Wondery\u002B in the Wondery App, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.
