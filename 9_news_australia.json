      "description": "Prince Andrew. War hero, Queen Elizabeth\u0027s favourite son, the Duke of York. Born into a life of privilege and duty, destined to serve the Crown as a senior member of the Royal Family. But the gilded life masked a very different one in private. A shadow loomed, cast by the Prince\u0027s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. The world watched as a disastrous television interview turned scandal into catastrophe. It was the beginning of the end for Andrew. It set in motion his downfall. His titles stripped. His reputation.. in ruins. \nFor the first time in generations, a British Prince has been banished.\nThis is a detailed documentary timeline of how the King\u0027s brother lost everything.\nThe extraordinary story of Prince Andrew, Duke of York, whose life of privilege and duty unravelled due to his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and the sexual assault allegations by Virginia Giuffre.\n\nThis video traces the complete timeline of the scandal, from the initial connections and the explosive 2019 BBC Newsnight interview, through the civil lawsuit, the removal of his military titles, and the final, historic move by King Charles to strip his brother of all remaining royal styles, titles, and honours. It details the public outrage, the \u0022Pizza Express\u0022 alibi, the multi-million-dollar out-of-court settlement, and his ultimate exile from public life.\n\nSubscribe and \uD83D\uDD14: http://9Soci.al/KM6e50GjSK9 | Get more breaking news at 9News.com.au: http://9Soci.al/iyCO50GjSK6\n\nCHAPTERS | KEY MOMENTS IN THIS VIDEO\n\n00:00 Introduction: The Scandal That Shook the Monarchy\n00:27 The Crisis Begins: Disastrous BBC Interview\n00:35 Immediate Fallout \u0026 Media Condemnation\n01:12 Virginia Giuffre\u0027s Lawsuit and Prince Andrew Named\n01:34 Buckingham Palace\u0027s Initial Denial\n02:13 Jeffrey Epstein\u0027s Death \u0026 Ongoing Investigation\n02:51 Ex-Wife Sarah Ferguson\u0027s Involvement\n03:09 The Infamous Photo: Andrew, Giuffre \u0026 Maxwell\n03:22 Prince Andrew\u0027s Public Denial Statements\n03:50 Focus on Jeffrey Epstein\u0027s Legal Troubles \u0026 Death\n04:19 Palace Response \u0026 Calls for Andrew to Testify\n04:40 Andrew\u0027s Ties to Other Powerful Figures (Trump, Clinton)\n05:48 The FBI \u0026 Metropolitan Correctional Center\n06:04 Attorney General William Barr on Epstein\u0027s Death\n07:05 Giuffre\u0027s Claims: The Teenager, the Prince, \u0026 the Photo\n08:15 Giuffre in Interview: Detailed Allegations\n09:44 The BBC Newsnight Interview Context (November 2019)\n10:48 Andrew\u0027s \u0027No Sweat\u0027 Alibi \u0026 Lack of Remorse\n11:35 Expert Opinion: PR Disaster \u0026 Public Reaction\n12:27 The \u0027Pizza Express Woking\u0027 Memes \u0026 Public Mockery\n13:00 Andrew Steps Back from Public Duties Indefinitely\n13:35 US Legal Action: Subpoena \u0026 Sex Trafficking Claims\n14:08 Lawyers for Epstein Victims Demand Cooperation\n14:27 King Charles III\u0027s Intervention \u0026 Pressure\n14:54 Civil Lawsuit Update: \u0027Baseless\u0027 \u0026 \u0027Unlawful\u0027 Claims\n15:41 Judge Lewis Kaplan: \u0027Let\u0027s Cut Out All the Technicalities\u0027\n16:07 The Royal Family\u0027s Stance \u0026 Reputation Risk\n17:09 UK High Court Intervention for Legal Service\n18:46 Formal Removal of Military Titles \u0026 HRH Style (Jan 2022)\n19:08 Andrew\u0027s Statement: Unsurprised by Ruling, Defends Himself\n19:45 The Confidential Out-of-Court Settlement\n21:07 King Charles III Honors Veterans \u0026 Faces Protest\n21:51 Public Confrontation with King Charles III\n23:11 The Ultimate Exile: Titles Stripped \u0026 House Eviction (Oct 2025)\n24:07 King Charles\u0027 Message to Victims \u0026 Survivors\n24:25 Virginia Giuffre\u0027s Posthumous Memoir \u0027Nobody\u0027s Girl\u0027\n25:08 The End of an Era: Royal Lodge \u0026 Relocation\n\nFOLLOW 9News Australia\n\u25BA Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/9News/\n\u25BA Twitter: https://twitter.com/9NewsAUS\n\u25BA Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/9news/\n\nJoin 9News for the latest in news and events that affect you in your local city, as well as news from across Australia and the world.\n\n#breakingnews #royalnews #9NEWS #royalfamily #documentary",
