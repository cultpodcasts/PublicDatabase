      "description": "When TikToker Nikale started calling local churches pretending to be a struggling mom in need of baby formula, she wasn\u2019t trying to start drama \u2014 she was running a social experiment. The goal? To see how many churches would actually help a mother in crisis. The results were shocking. This video dives into what her experiment revealed about Christian charity, church priorities, and the gap between faith and action. From the viral TikToks to the wider conversation about religious hypocrisy, poverty, and community care, this deep dive breaks down why Nikale\u2019s calls hit such a nerve online \u2014 and what they say about the modern church\u2019s response to real human need.\n\n#churchhurt #deconstruction #deconstructionjourney #religioustrauma #religiousabuse #christiantiktok",

      "description": "What does it really cost to be a \u201Cgood Christian woman\u201D?\n\nThis long-form Exvangelical documentary explores the hidden pressures placed on Christian wives and mothers within conservative and evangelical church culture. From purity culture and marital expectations to motherhood, submission, and spiritual abuse, this video breaks down how religious authority and gender roles have shaped\u2014and often harmed\u2014Christian women\u2019s lives.\n\nWe\u2019ll look at:\n- How purity culture affects women\u2019s sexual health and marital satisfaction\n- The emotional and financial traps of stay-at-home motherhood\n- The \u201CProverbs 31\u201D ideal and impossible standards of godly womanhood\n- The ways religious authority is used to silence women\u2019s pain\n\nWhy deconstruction often begins with women asking, \u201CIs this really what God wants for me?\u201D\n\nThis video is part of a larger conversation about deconstruction, feminism, and faith reconstruction within evangelical spaces. Whether you\u2019re deconstructing your own beliefs or trying to understand how church culture shapes gender, this deep dive offers compassion, clarity, and context.\n\n#religiousabuse #religioustrauma #spiritualabuse #fundiesnark #documentary #girldefined #christiannationalism",

      "description": "The Life and Death of Dr. James Dobson: Dr. James Dobson is arguably one of the most influential figures in modern American Christianity. Dobson is the founder of Focus on the Family, an advisor to U.S. presidents, and a key component in the formation of the Religious Right. His legacy reaches far beyond parenting advice or Christian radio and the harms are great. His teachings truly shaped evangelical culture. Eventually, it also shaped politics, gender roles, and family life.\n\nIn this documentary, we deep-dive into Dobson\u2019s life, what he built, and the ways his ideology influenced millions of evangelicals and impacted American politics. From over-the-top discipline and \u201Cfamily values\u201D to political efforts and his recent work through the Dr. James Dobson Family Institute, we\u2019ll cover both the life and death of Dr. James Dobson.\n\nBOOKS Mentioned: \nJesus and John Wayne: https://amzn.to/4lDYDnA\nThe Kingdom, The Power and The Glory: https://amzn.to/3HE8pbg\n\n#jamesdobson #exvangelical #deconstruction #religioustrauma #dobson #deepdive #documentary",

      "description": "Can someone fake faith to gain power over believers? In this powerful and thought-provoking clip, Dr. Jordan B. Peterson explores the dangers of feigned religiosity and the psychological tactics used by those who manipulate communities of faith for personal gain.\n\nDrawing from his deep knowledge of psychology, theology, and human behavior, Dr. Peterson breaks down how belief systems can be twisted into tools of control\u2014and why genuine faith requires more than just words.\n\nLike, comment, and share your thoughts below\u2014especially if you\u2019ve ever witnessed spiritual manipulation firsthand.\n\n#JordanPeterson #Faith #Manipulation #Belief #Religion #Psychology #Truth",

      "description": "Christian nationalism is not Christianity. It\u2019s a political ideology that uses religious language and imagery to manipulate people of faith into supporting authoritarian power. This video explores how Christian nationalism has taken hold in American politics, particularly within one party, by distorting scripture, exploiting fear, and blending religious identity with national identity.\n\nFrom the perspective of an exvangelical who no longer identifies as religious, this is a personal and political reflection on how spiritual manipulation fuels Christian nationalism\u2014and why that should concern everyone, regardless of belief. The rise of this movement threatens not only religious freedom but democracy itself, harming both believers and nonbelievers along the way.\n\nThis is not about attacking faith. It\u0027s about exposing the difference between genuine belief and political extremism wrapped in religious language. You don\u2019t need to be religious to oppose Christian nationalism. You just need to care about truth, freedom, and human dignity.\n\n#ChristianNationalism #Exvangelical #SeparationOfChurchAndState #ReligiousFreedom #Deconstruction #FaithAndPolitics #AmericanDemocracy #ReligiousTrauma #ChristianityAndPolitics",

The spiritual theatrics. If you\u2019ve ever felt sick watching someone publicly weaponize repentance for views \u2014 same.\n\n\uD83D\uDE2C Why does this feel more like a content strategy than an actual confession?\n\uD83C\uDFAD What even is repentance in evangelical circles? (Hint: it\u2019s usually about control.)\n\uD83D\uDCC9 And why does this entire video feel like one giant red flag wrapped in a Bible verse?\n\nAs an exvangelical, I\u2019m breaking it all down \u2014 the theology, the drama, and the ick factor. If you\u2019ve been burned by public Christian influencers pretending to be humble while doubling down on toxic beliefs, you\u2019re not alone.#paulandmorgan  #girldefined #exvangelical",
