      "description": "In this powerful full-length interview, we sit down with a former member of Dwell Community Church, formerly known as Xenos Christian Fellowship, to uncover the experiences, inner workings, and difficult journey of leaving what many have called a high-control religious group.\n\nFrom communal living and spiritual manipulation to the personal toll of cutting ties, this interview sheds light on the hidden dynamics behind the scenes of Dwell/Xenos. Whether you\u0027re researching the group, healing from religious trauma, or simply seeking understanding, this unfiltered conversation offers crucial insight.\n\nGUEST INFO: \nNiddy is a voice in what could be considered an \u0022Atheosphere\u0022 on YouTube. On his channel, he does his hot takes on Christian content and some live interviews with believers and non-believers.  You can catch him in a lot of live chats moderating some of his favorite channels. You can even catch him live with Biblical scholar Kipp Davis on their show Budget Scripture Saturday. \n\nYouTube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0Ie3gJoF6M \n\n#religioustrauma #exvangelical #deconstruction #spiritualabuse #dwell #xenos #cult",

We examine the program\u0027s structure, practices, and claims of faith-based rehabilitation, alongside testimonies from former participants. As concerns grow about abuse, lack of regulation, and the mental health consequences of these programs, it\u0027s more important than ever to hold them accountable. Whether you\u0027re a parent researching teen rehab programs, a survivor seeking validation, or someone exploring the darker side of the troubled teen industry, this video provides essential context and critical insight.\n\n#teenchallenge #teenchallengeokc #troubledteenindustry #troubledteen #adultteenchallenge #adultandteenchallenge #codesilence #breakingcodesilence",

It\u2019s a political ideology that uses religious language and imagery to manipulate people of faith into supporting authoritarian power. This video explores how Christian nationalism has taken hold in American politics, particularly within one party, by distorting scripture, exploiting fear, and blending religious identity with national identity.\n\nFrom the perspective of an exvangelical who no longer identifies as religious, this is a personal and political reflection on how spiritual manipulation fuels Christian nationalism\u2014and why that should concern everyone, regardless of belief. The rise of this movement threatens not only religious freedom but democracy itself, harming both believers and nonbelievers along the way.\n\nThis is not about attacking faith. It\u0027s about exposing the difference between genuine belief and political extremism wrapped in religious language. You don\u2019t need to be religious to oppose Christian nationalism. You just need to care about truth, freedom, and human dignity.\n\n#ChristianNationalism #Exvangelical #SeparationOfChurchAndState #ReligiousFreedom #Deconstruction #FaithAndPolitics #AmericanDemocracy #ReligiousTrauma #ChristianityAndPolitics",
