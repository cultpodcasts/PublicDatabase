      "description": "What happened when Prince William decided to speak out on Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor\u2019s connection to Jeffrey Epstein? And did the statement go far enough? Listen as Chris and Lizzie describe how it all unfolded, while they were in Saudi Arabia with Prince William. They talk us through how they found out that Kensington Palace, and Buckingham Palace, decided to end the royal wall of silence, addressing the allegations against the former-Prince Andrew. So what did Buckingham Palace\u2019s statement on Andrew say? How does Prince William really feel about his uncle, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor? And what are the police now looking into? A reminder, that ITV News have put the latest allegations to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor who did not respond, and when he was previously approached for a response he strenuously denied all wrongdoing.",

The undated images have no caption but appear to show the former duke touching the woman\u2019s stomach.\n\nVarious emails also reveal the extent of the friendship between the former royal couple and Jeffrey Epstein. Screenshots and scans appear to show Andrew exchanged emails with Jeffrey Epstein about a \u201Cbeautiful\u201D Russian woman and invited him to Buckingham Palace in 2010. This raises questions about Andrew\u2019s earlier claims he had cut contact with the convicted paedophile after Epstein\u2019s conviction.",
