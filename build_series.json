      "description": "In \u0022My Scientology Movie,\u0022 Louis Theroux explores the mystery that shrouds the religion of Scientology. Originally, the filmmakers try to involve the Church of Scientology, but it refuses. Theroux then teams up with Mark Rathbun, former senior church official, to create reconstructions of incidents, witnessed by Rathbun and others, that occurred within the church. As a result, the church puts Theroux and his film crew under surveillance, leading to camera-wielding confrontations. Hear what Theroux and director John Dower have to say about making the film.
