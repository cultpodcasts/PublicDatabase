      "description": "#charliedogwood  #history #japan #japanesehistory \n\nDISCORD: https://discord.gg/MHgtgFcNAu\n\nWelcome to Tier One of the Japanese Cult Iceberg explained. I guess you have to have that sort of thing on there to make sure you show up in the algorithm. I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m trying my best here, man.\n\nToday we\u0027re going to dive on in and start looking at cults in Japan...and also some just strange religions. Ranging from controlling groups like Soka Gakkai to dangerous ones like Shoko Asahara\u0027s Aum Shinrikyo, even funny ones like Happy Science. We cover them all and them some. \n\nI plan on making more of these, depending on the reception. Hopefully it\u0027s good.\n\nA History Documentary in the Storyteller style by Charlie Dogwood, 2025\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Intro\n1:13 The Unification Church\n16:06 Tenrikyo\n22:49 Soka Gakkai\n35:49 Aum Shinrikyo\n41:52 Happy Science\n53:58 Omoto\n1:01:51 Outro\n\n-MUSIC CREDITS-\nKrishmeister - Dark Suspense\n\nMY LINKS:\nMain Channel: @CharlesDogwood \nVOD Channel: @Charlie_Dogwood_Games \nJapanese Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@the_rui_channel\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/charlie_dogwood\n\nPatreon: patreon.com/CharlieDogwood\nKo-fi: https://ko-fi.com/charliedogwood",
