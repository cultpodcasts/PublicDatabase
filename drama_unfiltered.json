      "title": "Cody Brown: The Cult Leader Who Lost His Followers | Drama Unfiltered",
      "description": "Cody Brown once positioned himself as the spiritual patriarch of a sacred polygamist family. But what happens when the man claiming to lead with love is exposed as leading with control?\n\nIn this brutal takedown from Drama Unfiltered, we reveal how Cody\u2019s kingdom was never based on love\u2014it was built on ego, favoritism, and selective memory.\n\nFrom Robin\u2019s \u201Clightning bolt\u201D moment to the weaponized word safety, this episode peels back every layer of emotional manipulation.\n\nChristine, Janelle, and Meri aren\u2019t just ex-wives. They\u2019re ex-believers\u2014women who finally walked away from Cody\u2019s one-man church.\n\n\uD83D\uDCA5 No more loyalty.\n\uD83D\uDCA3 No more lies.\n\uD83D\uDD25 No more sermons.\n\nThis isn\u2019t Sister Wives anymore. This is the fall of a self-declared prophet.\n\n\uD83E\uDDE8 Comment below: Was Cody ever a real leader\u2014or just selling a spiritual illusion?\n\uD83D\uDD14 Subscribe to Drama Unfiltered\u2014where masks drop and myths burn.",
