      "description": "In this episode, Naomi speaks honestly about the pain of being raised in an environment where love felt conditional and safety was never promised. She explains how emotional abuse often goes unseen but leaves a deep impact that lasts for years. Through her story, she shows how trauma can affect your thoughts, your body, and your sense of self. She also shares what it looks like to start healing by naming the truth, reconnecting with your voice, and slowly building a life that feels safe and real. About the host, Naomi Sparks: Naomi Sparks is a mom, wife, healing coach, and a cult survivor. She grew up in a tightly controlled religious cult in Northern California and spent years disconnected from her true self. Her work now centres around helping others reclaim their voice, heal generational pain, and step into wholeness without apology. Quote of the episode: \u201CMinimising your pain doesn\u0027t make you stronger. It makes your healing harder.\u201D Questions to think about: Have I ever felt like my feelings were too much for someone else? Do I stay quiet to avoid conflict or rejection? Was I taught that love had to be earned? \u0026#x1f450; Healing takes time, but it begins when you tell the truth, feel what you need to feel, find safe support, learn what safety feels like in your body, and treat yourself with care as you grow.
