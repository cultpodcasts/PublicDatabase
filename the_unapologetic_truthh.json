      "description": "Let\u2019s talk about that quiet but powerful emotion that shows up in so many healing journeys: shame. The kind that whispers, not screams. The kind that makes you feel like you need to hide, shrink, and stay silent. Naomi explores where shame comes from and how it teaches us to hide the very parts of ourselves that need the most love. This is about naming it, feeling it, and slowly letting it go through movement, truth-telling, and self-compassion. Listen to the full episode to hear the reflective prompts to help you identify where shame still lives in your healing and what it would mean to stop carrying what was never yours. This is a space to name the weight you\u2019ve been carrying. To stop apologising for your pain. And to remember you were never meant to hold this alone. \u0026#x1f49a; ABOUT THE HOST, NAOMI SPARKS: Naomi Sparks is a mom, wife, healing coach, and a cult survivor. She grew up in a tightly controlled religious cult in Northern California and spent years disconnected from her true self. Her work now centers around helping others reclaim their voice, heal generational pain, and step into wholeness without apology. QUOTE OF THE EPISODE: \u201CSilence doesn\u2019t protect your peace. It protects the pain. And healing doesn\u0027t require silence, it requires truth.\u201C TO ASK YOURSELF GENTLY: Where is shame hiding in your healing? What parts of yourself do you still feel like you have to hide? And who or what told you that part was shameful to begin with? \u0026#x1f49a; Connect with Naomi on IG: @theunapologetictruthh \u0026#x1f3a7; Subscribe so you don\u2019t miss the next one.

This is a space to feel what you were once told to suppress. And a reminder that your resentment isn\u2019t shameful.
