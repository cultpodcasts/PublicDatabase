      "description": "In March 2024, we investigated and broke down the case of Eligio Bishop, a.k.a. Nature Boy, who was the leader of Carbon Nation, which many believe to be a sex cult based in Atlanta. Bishop was charged and convicted of rape, false imprisonment, and three counts of prohibition on nude or sexually explicit electronic transmissions and is now serving a life sentence. Despite this, in this TSR Update, we spoke to three of his wives, who are ready to fight for him and appeal his case. His primary wife, Queen Malia, claims that all members of Carbon Nation knew about the lifestyle before joining the group. Bishop\u2019s wives also claim that the evidence they presented was not considered in court. \n\nTSR Investigates explores cold cases and special interest news stories underrepresented in mainstream media.\n\n#NatureBoy #Cult #Atlanta #TSRInvestigatesUpdatez\n-----------------------\nTHE SHADE ROOM is the culture --- What\u2019s going on, who\u2019s worth talking about, the trends, the hashtags, and the challenges in the streets and on Tik Tok.\n\nWEBSITE: https://theshaderoom.com/\nFACEBOOK: https://facebook.com/theshaderoom\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/theshaderoom\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/theshaderoom/ \n\nSubscribe to our weekly Newsletter: https://theshaderoom.com/subscribe",
