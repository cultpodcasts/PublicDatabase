This week I speak with Aliya Kasabian who at 16 years old found herself trapped in this place. We cover: The nightmare of being kidnapped in the middle of the night to go to Boise The bizarre rules that seem counterproductive to the mission of helping these young women The truly heart-breaking punishments girls faced when rules were not followed Why her parents thought they were \u0022giving her a gift\u0022 by sending her there This is part one and next week we pick up where we leave off and then talk about leaving the program, the PTSD still suffered, and what she is doing these days. _____________________________________ Aliya\u0027s Instagram: www.instagram.com/sandb0xb0y/ Aliya\u0027s Tattoo Page: www.instagram.com/tats.by.li _____________________________________ Link to all things Not in a Huff Podcast: https://linktr.ee/notinahuffpodcast Please follow/subscribe to the podcast to be the first to see new episodes when they come out each week.

      "description": "This week we dive back into the world of the Independent Fundamental Baptist (IFB) movement. A church that many call a cult. We speak more specifically this time about their homes for \u0022troubled teens\u0022. Some of these teens sent to these homes needed mental health counseling, some were being \u0022ungodly\u0022, and others sent away for simple things such as smoking a cigarette. Regardless of the reasons we learn this week that these homes were at best ill equipped to help and at worse an abusive place that brutally punished and terrorized those they were asked to help. I talk with Amanda Householder who was featured in the documentary \u0022Let Us Prey\u0022 that exposed IFB for what it is. She grew up in the troubled teens homes that were AGAPE and Circle of Hope not necessarily because she was a troubled teen herself, but because her parents (now charged with over 100 crimes) ran the facilities. This is a powerful chat. _____________________________________ Amanda\u0027s Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/berlinvonmortis/ _____________________________________ Link to all things Not in a Huff Podcast: https://linktr.ee/notinahuffpodcast Please follow/subscribe to the podcast to be the first to see new episodes when they come out each week.

      "description": "This week I speak with Briell Decker about growing up in the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS). A world of polygamy and total allegiance to the leader, Warren Jeffs. We talk about her childhood and at 18 years old being chosen by this leader who was 50 years old to be his 65th wife. We talk about that time and eventually escaping it all. It became and amazing full circle moment when Warren Jeffs went to prison (where he is currently serving a life sentence) she was awarded his 40 bedroom mansion where she made it a recovery center for others escaping polygamy.

      "description": "Jonestown, Branch Davidians, Moonies, The Source Family. We have heard of some of the biggest cults of all time. This week we examine the rise of \u0022micro-cults\u0022. Rather than have hundreds of followers that make waves in society following one leader there is a growing prevalence on cults with 10-20 members following a guru, be it a family member or someone who has just latched on to a family. That is exactly what happened to Peter Young when he married into a family who had a \u0022family guru\u0022 after several years of marriage he realized that his character who went by \u0022Uncle Robert\u0022 was much more than a family friend, but someone who controlled his wife and her immediate family. Through years of battles and a lot of truly mind blowing things happening (stolen wedding rings, \u0022casino church\u0027, and surrogacy for the leader) this cult finally made him lose his marriage when he would not submit completely to the teaching. This is a remarkable story about the power of a cult of personality and getting out before it is too late.\n_____________________________________\nPick Up \u0022Stop the Tall Man, Save the Tiger\u0022 here: https://shorturl.at/eklP7\nPeter\u0027s Website: https://www.authorpeteryoung.com/\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nLink to all things Not in a Huff Podcast: https://linktr.ee/notinahuffpodcast\nPlease follow/subscribe to the podcast to be the first to see new episodes when they come out each week.

An organization that was featured in the Amazon Prime documentary \u0022Shiny Happy People: Duggar Family Secrets\u0022. We learn about the smooth talking leader, Bill Gothard and the truly heartbreaking things he was teaching people. We learn the terrible things he was doing to \u0022Gothard Girl\u0027s\u0022 and we unpack how the Duggar family, of TLC\u0027s 19 Kids and Counting fame, became the token family of this organization. Lindsey also walks us through growing up being homeschooled using the teachings of IBLP, something they called ATI (Advance Training Institute) where she introduces us to \u0022Wisdom Books\u0022 that provided little real wisdom and were certainly not advanced. So, whether you watched the documentary and want more insider information or are learning about this all for the first time I urge you to listen._____________________________________Lindsey\u0027s \u0022Crazy Pretty\u0022 Website: https://crazypretty.com/Cult Chronicles IG: https://www.instagram.com/thecultchronicles/Lindsey\u0027s LinkTree: https://linktr.ee/Cultchronicles_____________________________________Link to all things Not in a Huff Podcast: https://linktr.ee/notinahuffpodcastPlease follow/subscribe to the podcast to be the first to see new episodes when they come out each week.

While feeding Hollywood\u0027s rich and famous in his restaurant downstairs, upstairs and in the parking lot after closing he was leading a group of young people into a world where he was was the chosen leader and others were to follow. We speak with one such follower who joined early in \u0022The Family\u0027s\u0022 creation in Wendy Baker who left home at 14 years old and began following \u0022Father Yod\u0022 as he was later called and did so until his death under interesting circumstances. Through moves to Hollywood mansions, being kidnapped to Hawaii, getting pregnant in the commune at 16, and escaping to lead a seemingly normal life this week you are in for a fascinating journey into a world of charismatic leaders and devoted followers. Was \u0022The Source Family\u0022 a cult or a happy go lucky commune? I will let you be the judge. _____________________________________ Wendy\u0027s Website: https://wendybakerauthor.com/ \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Link to all things Not in a Huff Podcast: https://linktr.ee/notinahuffpodcast Please follow/subscribe to the podcast to get the new episodes when they come out each week and rate us on Apple Podcast and Spotify! :)",
