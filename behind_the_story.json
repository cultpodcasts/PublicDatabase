      "description": "\u0022The world saw a cult leader. I was just following orders\u2014from Heaven.\u0022\nIn this final reflection, told from the perspective of Reverend Sun Myung Moon himself, we dive into the life of one of the most controversial religious figures of the 20th century. From claims of receiving a divine mission from Jesus Christ at age 16, to building a global religious and political empire\u2014this is not just a retelling of events. It\u0027s a confession.\n\nWhat does it mean to be called the messiah by your followers\u2014and a fraud by the rest of the world?\nWhat happens when a man believes he was chosen to finish what Jesus started?\n\nThis isn\u2019t a documentary. It\u2019s a reckoning.\nThe story of Reverend Moon\u2014as he might have told it before the end.\n\n\uD83D\uDD14 Subscribe for more powerful stories and life lessons: https://www.youtube.com/@BehindTheStoryWithTG?sub_confirmation=1\n\uD83D\uDC4D Like | \uD83D\uDCAC Comment | \uD83D\uDD17 Share to inspire others",
