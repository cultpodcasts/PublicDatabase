I also take a trip to the guru\u0027s childhood home and recount the story of his former son-in-law (and how he wound up in prison).Thanks for listening. And don\u0027t unsubscribe, as I\u0027ll be uploading plenty of bonus content into the near future.Warning: this episode includes discussion of sexual abuse.",

In a fenced-in compound, three generations of the Global Community Communications Alliance soak in Gabriel\u0027s teachings as they wait for the end of the world. Join investigative journalist Joseph L. Flatley as he travels around the country, speaking to Gabriel\u0027s ex-followers, cult experts, and people who knew him before he was a so-called prophet. You\u0027ll learn why people join a group like this, why they stay as long as they do, and the challenges they face when they decide to leave. And you\u2019ll hear some groovy music in the process. In the premiere episode, we meet Tony Delevin from Pittsburgh. He first started hearing voices in the 1980s, after his second marriage fell apart. Eventually, the voices told him to change his name to Gabriel and move to Arizona, where he lives today with his 100-plus followers.",
