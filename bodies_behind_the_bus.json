They explore the impact of systemic religious abuse, the emboldening of harmful rhetoric, and the personal toll of continuing to fight for marginalized communities. The episode is a candid look at grief, exhaustion, and the fire that drives change, while also honoring the voices of survivors and the commitment to amplifying their stories. Listeners will hear reflections on what it means to live and work in integrity, how to support vulnerable communities, and the challenges of confronting systemic failures in both the church and society at large.

Through her newly released book, Baptist Land: A Memoir of Abuse, Betrayal, and Transformation, Christa offers an unflinchingly honest exploration of her life\u0027s ordeals and the path to recovery and empowerment. This episode delves deep into the themes of resilience in the face of betrayal, the complexities of family dynamics, and the courage it takes to break free from authoritative and abusive structures. Christa\u0027s narrative is a testament to the power of speaking out and finding one\u0027s voice amid adversity. Join us as we journey with Christa through her compelling story, the challenges and revelations of writing her memoir, and her ongoing advocacy for survivors everywhere.

Both counseling professors were attempting to help me as I processed the situation, but they were nearly powerless to effect change since Brian Tabb was Naselli\u2019s supervisor. The first counseling professor tried to help by having me collect stories. The second professor especially advocated for me and other students, bringing our concerns to the elders on multiple occasions in the hopes that both Naselli and Tabb would be held accountable.\u201D Butterfly House Films, LLC Support the show",
