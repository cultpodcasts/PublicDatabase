      "description": "Daniella was born a third-generation member of the infamous Children of God religious cult, and grew up being trafficked around the world, before escaping that life and moving to America at age 15. She put herself through high school and graduated as college valedictorian before commissioning into the US Army as an intelligence officer. That\u2019s where she really started to think about group behavior\u2026and seeing it, well, everywhere. \r\n\r\nDaniella deployed twice to Afghanistan (2011, 2014) and became a member of one of the Army\u2019s first Female Engagement teams (an experiment that put women into deliberate ground combat for the first time in Army history, and eventually led to the repeal of the sexist combat ban and the gender desegregation of the entire US military). \r\n\r\nShe is a proud daughter of the 101st, (that\u0027s the unit in Band of Brothers), a recipient of the Presidential Volunteer Service Award (from Obama, y\u0027all), and is currently pursuing a Master of Arts in Organizational Psychology at the Harvard Extension School (she focuses her research on group behavior, social norms, culture, extremism, leadership demagoguery and cults).

      "title": "Cults and Religious Deceit Uncovered: Dissecting the History of American Evangelical Church",
      "description": "History of Bloody Massacres at hands of American Evangelical Christians. Jeric share some details regarding American Christian\u2019s slaughtering America Indigenous people who also were Christians, the Indians. The Indians were in America before the white men arrived and took the land by force, believing that God had given it to them. They believed in the God of Abraham, Jacob, and Jesus Christ. Despite their shared faith, white privileged Christian men took the land by force, killing thousands of Indians, including Christian Indians. This raises the question of how people who worshiped the same God could commit such atrocities against one another. These white Christian men used Bible scripture to justify such believes and their evil actions. Some even quoted scriptures while killing babies, men and women, in the name of Jesus? How Ironic. This is covered up and not shared by the America evangelical church today. Jeric highlights how American evangelicals misuse Bible scripture to justify their hatred towards marginalized groups, including the LGBTQIA community. They falsely claim to represent Jesus while spreading hate. Looking at the past 2,000 years of Christianity and religion, we can see similarities in patterns and behaviors, but with different crimes against humanity and mistreatment of humans. They Treat other groups of people less and as inhuman than who are different with religious doctrines, different skin color and beliefs and has different sexual preferences.  Nothing has changed the same was and same is today. Most evangelical Christian\u2019s do not change they follow patterns as their ancestors and justify it by using scripture. It just in different forms and actions. this is part 1!  \r\n\r\nHey use this amazing platform for your livestreams!\r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

Indeed, Andrew attended Grenville in the 1990s and saw first-hand the horrific abuse that was inflicted on minors. Currently, he serves as a representative plaintiff and press officer for the Grenville Christian College Class Action. His book is the culmination of his research going back nine and half years. Andrew is British. He and his family reside and work in the United Kingdom, but he travels regularly to Canada to brief the media on matters pertaining to the cult, which damaged numerous lives. Andrew has a long history of social justice and human rights activism, and his exposure of abuse at Grenville is in keeping with that tradition.

      "description": "Janice was born and raised in a charismatic Christian home, attending Pentecostal, \r\nVineyard, and other Evangelical churches before eventually marrying a man who would become a pastor. In her 30s she became ultraconservative, donning a head-covering, homeschooling their children, and rejecting any vestiges of secular life (TV, radio, music, newspapers, magazines, etc.). \u201CI referred to myself as \u2018Mennocostal,\u2019 frequently attending closed Mennonite churches run by the Holdeman Mennonites.\u201D\r\n \r\nIt wasn\u2019t until her 40s that Janice began experiencing doubts about her deeply held faith. As her marriage unraveled, her questions grew. She found herself wondering about the impact of religion and religious trauma syndrome on sexuality, gender roles and equality, social justice, and more.  \r\n \r\n\u201CNot permitted to explore these questions, I felt like a beach ball held beneath the water for too long. My sadness, confusion, and anger threatened to explode if something didn\u0027t change.\u201D\r\n \r\nAfter ending her decades-long marriage, Janice went back to school to attain her Diploma of Applied Psychology and Counselling. \r\n \r\n\u201CMy passion is to help others who are experiencing the multiple significant losses associated with religious de-conversion and religious trauma syndrome. My own journey could have been easier if I had been able to connect with even one other person who had walked away from their faith and built a healthy life afterward.\u201D \r\n \r\nThese painful experiences influenced Janice to develop the Divorcing Religion Workshop so that others could gain knowledge and tools to help with their own journey out of fundamentalist religions.  \r\n\r\nHey use this amazing platform for your livestreams!\r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?
