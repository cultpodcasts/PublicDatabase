      "title": "Ep 303: Mica Francis: Analyzing the Federal Charges Against John Paul Miller with Mandy Matney and Liz Farrell",
      "description": "30-year-old Mica Miller, n\u00E9e Francis was found dead from a gunshot wound at Lumber River State Park in Robeson County, North Carolina on April 27, 2024. Her death occurred just two days after she had served her husband, John Paul Miller, with divorce papers. In December Miller was indicted for cyberstalking and making false statements to federal investigators. He appeared in federal court on January 11 2026. In this episode, you\u2019ll hear what happened in court and Laura unravels the newly unsealed federal indictment with award-winning investigative journalist Mandy Matney and award-winning author Liz Farrell, co-hosts of the True Sunlight podcast. Together, they carefully unpack the charges in the indictment, timelines, and alleged behaviours, as well as discussing why this did not happen when Mica was alive. Laura, Mandy, and Liz discuss why post-separation periods are often high-risk, how cyberstalking can function as coercive control, the importance of accountability and keeping the spotlight on these cases and why understanding patterns -not isolated events -is essential to prevention and justice. Understanding escalation and coercive control is lifesaving and life changing. Listen and share, you may save a life. #MicaFrancis #MicaMiller #JusticeForMica #CrimeAnalyst #Expert #Analysis #TrueCrime #Podcast #Crime #CoerciveControl #Stalking #Expert #Cyberstalking #FBI #INnvestigation Clips https://youtu.be/3y7f9dciL0I?si=YUd8gS8OxTUTuSuG Sources Links to Laura and Mandy\u2019s previous discussion re Mica Miller (nee Francis) Ep 200: Unraveling Mica Miller n\u00E8e Francis\u2019 Death and Coercive Control Cross Over with Mandy Matney Ep 201: Mica Miller N\u00E9e Francis: Analysing The Digital Evidence and Mica\u2019s List, Part 2 Link to Cross Over episode with Mandy and Laura on Cup of Justice Ep #86: Apple Link: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/coj-86-crime-analyst-expert-laura-richards-joins-mandy/id1668668400?i=1000659373717 Spotify Link https://open.spotify.com/episode/10P6t5LmMxF3YHUdgxPcm9?si=e3832e105dc1430d Mandy and Liz: Mandy IG Mandy Website Murdaugh Murders Podcast Liz on Instagram Liz Website Liz on Cup of Justice 2026 Masterclasses and Crime Analyst Resources and Community Laura offers 2026 Masterclasses covering topics such as profiling behavior, stalking class on February 12, preventing murder and suicide in slow motion on February 19, coercive control February 25, DASH Risk Masterclass March 11 and 12 and DASH Train the Trainer.

      "description": "A federal grand jury in Columbia returned a two-count indictment against John Paul Miller, 46, of Myrtle Beach, for cyberstalking and making false statements to federal investigators.\n\nThe indictment alleges that beginning in November 2022, Miller sent unwanted and harassing communications to his estranged wife until her death on April 27, 2024. The harassing behavior included Miller posting a nude photo of the victim online without her consent, causing tracking devices to be placed on her vehicle, and in one instance, contacting her over 50 times in a single day. The indictment also alleges he interfered with her finances and her daily activities and on one occasion damaged her vehicle tires.\n\nFederal investigators interviewed Miller about these allegations and Miller lied in his responses. \u00A0Miller said he did not damage the victim\u2019s tires, when in fact he purchased a tire deflation device online and sent messages to others regarding the victim\u2019s vehicle.\n\nMiller faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison for cyberstalking and two years in prison for his false statements. He also faces a fine of up to $250,000. His arraignment is scheduled for Jan. 12, 2026, in federal court in Florence.\n\nIt\u2019s time for some accountability \uD83D\uDD25\n\n\u2705 LISTEN to Ep #200 and 201 Unraveling Mica Miller n\u00E8e Francis\u2019 Death and Coercive Control Cross Over with Mandy Matney\n\n#JusticeForMica #Mica #MicasList #Accountability #JohnPaulMiller #PoorMeSyndrome #SourhCarolina #CoerciveControl #Stalking #PostSeparationAbuse #Separation #HighRisk #PowerAndControl #CrimeAnalyst #Podcast",

      "description": "Laura and co-host Lisa Bilyeu are joined by Sarah Edmondson, NXIVM cult whistleblower, actor and author of Scarred. As the prosecution start to wrap their case, Laura, Lisa and Sarah highlight the important parrels and blueprint of the successful prosecutions of NXIVM boss Keith Raniere and R Kelly and discuss whether the legal standard of the charges against Combs have been met. Sarah shares sharp insight into the mindset of victims and the slow line bending erosion of autonomy, drawing powerful comparisons between her experience in NXIVM and the behavior laid out in the charges against Combs. Laura breaks down the impact of victim blaming including Bill Maher\u2019s disgraceful monologue blaming Cassie telling women to \u2018just leave,\u2019 as well as coercive control tactics used by perpetrators, including recruiting female lieutenants, to dominate not just intimate partners, but also employees, associates, and entire systems. This episode goes beyond headlines \u2014 it asks harder questions about accountability, those who choose to look away and those who enable abusers and how people with power maintain control. Listen now and share widely. Understanding coercive control isn\u2019t just knowledge- it\u2019s protection for you and those you know so you don\u2019t get caught in the trap.

      "description": "Week 3 of Sean \u201CDiddy\u201D Combs trial and Laura and Lisa Bilyeu dive into the powerful testimony of Capricorn Clark, who described the fear, threats, and intimidation she witnessed and experienced including the threat to Kid Cudi, and Diddy\u2019s calculated use of staff to control and retrieve Cassie. Laura explains the DASH Risk Assessment Model and how it is used to decode coercive control, stalking behaviors and credible threats to harm and/or kill. Dr. Nadine Macaluso unpacks the psychological aftermath of coercive control and the devastating impact of trauma bonds. Laura debunks Stockholm Syndrome, how women\u2019s trauma and survival responses are different to men\u2019s as well as what happens when violence is normalized and abuse becomes routine. Laura and Dr. Nadine bring clarity to how abuser\u2019s use shame, fear, and manipulation to entrap victims. They analyze the courtroom testimony from Deonte Nash and \u201CMia,\u201D as well as one of the most common things abuser\u2019s say after a violent attack and how grooming and boundary erosion sets the stage for physical and sexual abuse. Finally, Laura and Lisa address the defense\u2019s request for a mistrial and the implications of that move, while sharing resources to better understand coercive control and risk. This episode is a vital listen. The courtroom isn\u2019t just a stage for justice - it\u2019s a lens into systemic patterns of abuse, gaslighting denial, and accountability. Listen now and share this episode with someone who needs to hear it and gain critical insights that empower you to spot the red flags and demand true accountability in a system that too often fails survivors.

      "description": "Laura Richards and co-host Lisa Bilyeu are joined by former CIA spy and intelligence expert Andrew Bustamante to unpack the complex web of evidence, abuse, and control unfolding in the Sean \u201CDiddy\u201D trial. Laura, Lisa and Andrew explore the charges against Combs including that Combs abused, threatened, and coerced women and others, and led a racketeering conspiracy that engaged in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice, in comparison with particular testimonies including Regina Ventura, Cassie\u2019s mother, Dawn Richard, Kerry Morgan, \u0022The Punisher\u201D and Kid Cudi. Laura highlights how abusers weaponise fear and power to maintain control, and how those in their orbit enable the abuse\u2014whether through silence or active participation. Andrew brings a spy\u2019s lens to the case, analyzing Diddy\u2019s tactics through the eyes of a trained operative\u2014making powerful connections between psychological warfare and public manipulation. This isn\u2019t just about Sean Combs and Cassie Ventura. It\u2019s bigger than that. It\u2019s about a systemic failure to protect women and girls\u2014and what must change. Listen now.
