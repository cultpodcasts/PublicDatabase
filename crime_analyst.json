      "description": "In the case of the USA v. Sean Combs, the jury returned a shocking verdict on Wednesday 2nd July after just over two days of deliberating. Eight men and four women found Combs not guilty on the more serious charges he faced and guilty of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. Laura is joined by criminal defense attorney and ABC Legal Contributor, Brian Buckmire, who has been in court every day of the trial. Laura and Brian unravel what went wrong for the prosecution, what went right for the defense, what needs to change to hold powerful men accountable for abusing women, and they share their thoughts on the future sentencing of now twice convicted felon, Combs. This conversation and series takes you inside the case against Diddy, the justice system which was created by men to protect men and what needs to happen to ensure justice works for women.

As the prosecution start to wrap their case, Laura, Lisa and Sarah highlight the important parrels and blueprint of the successful prosecutions of NXIVM boss Keith Raniere and R Kelly and discuss whether the legal standard of the charges against Combs have been met. Sarah shares sharp insight into the mindset of victims and the slow line bending erosion of autonomy, drawing powerful comparisons between her experience in NXIVM and the behavior laid out in the charges against Combs. Laura breaks down the impact of victim blaming including Bill Maher\u2019s disgraceful monologue blaming Cassie telling women to \u2018just leave,\u2019 as well as coercive control tactics used by perpetrators, including recruiting female lieutenants, to dominate not just intimate partners, but also employees, associates, and entire systems. This episode goes beyond headlines \u2014 it asks harder questions about accountability, those who choose to look away and those who enable abusers and how people with power maintain control. Listen now and share widely. Understanding coercive control isn\u2019t just knowledge- it\u2019s protection for you and those you know so you don\u2019t get caught in the trap.

      "description": "Week 3 of Sean \u201CDiddy\u201D Combs trial and Laura and Lisa Bilyeu dive into the powerful testimony of Capricorn Clark, who described the fear, threats, and intimidation she witnessed and experienced including the threat to Kid Cudi, and Diddy\u2019s calculated use of staff to control and retrieve Cassie. Laura explains the DASH Risk Assessment Model and how it is used to decode coercive control, stalking behaviors and credible threats to harm and/or kill. Dr. Nadine Macaluso unpacks the psychological aftermath of coercive control and the devastating impact of trauma bonds. Laura debunks Stockholm Syndrome, how women\u2019s trauma and survival responses are different to men\u2019s as well as what happens when violence is normalized and abuse becomes routine. Laura and Dr. Nadine bring clarity to how abuser\u2019s use shame, fear, and manipulation to entrap victims. They analyze the courtroom testimony from Deonte Nash and \u201CMia,\u201D as well as one of the most common things abuser\u2019s say after a violent attack and how grooming and boundary erosion sets the stage for physical and sexual abuse. Finally, Laura and Lisa address the defense\u2019s request for a mistrial and the implications of that move, while sharing resources to better understand coercive control and risk. This episode is a vital listen. The courtroom isn\u2019t just a stage for justice - it\u2019s a lens into systemic patterns of abuse, gaslighting denial, and accountability. Listen now and share this episode with someone who needs to hear it and gain critical insights that empower you to spot the red flags and demand true accountability in a system that too often fails survivors. This could save a life.

      "description": "Laura Richards and co-host Lisa Bilyeu are joined by former CIA spy and intelligence expert Andrew Bustamante to unpack the complex web of evidence, abuse, and control unfolding in the Sean \u201CDiddy\u201D trial. Laura, Lisa and Andrew explore the charges against Combs including that Combs abused, threatened, and coerced women and others, and led a racketeering conspiracy that engaged in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice, in comparison with particular testimonies including Regina Ventura, Cassie\u2019s mother, Dawn Richard, Kerry Morgan, \u0022The Punisher\u201D and Kid Cudi. Laura highlights how abusers weaponise fear and power to maintain control, and how those in their orbit enable the abuse\u2014whether through silence or active participation. Andrew brings a spy\u2019s lens to the case, analyzing Diddy\u2019s tactics through the eyes of a trained operative\u2014making powerful connections between psychological warfare and public manipulation. This isn\u2019t just about Sean Combs and Cassie Ventura. It\u2019s bigger than that. It\u2019s about a systemic failure to protect women and girls\u2014and what must change. Listen now.

      "description": "Laura and co-host Lisa Bilyeu are joined by two powerhouse guests: Dr. Nadine Macaluso, trauma bond expert and ex-wife of the real Wolf of Wall Street, and Brian Buckmire, criminal defense trial attorney and ABC Legal Contributor. Laura, Lisa and Nadine unpack the insidious dynamics of love bombing, grooming, and power imbalance and manipulation straight out of the abuser\u2019s playbook. They explore cognitive dissonance, and the shame and sexual coercion many women endure in silence. Nadine shares deeply personal insights from her own experience, having walked in Cassie Ventura\u2019s shoes, offering a survivor-informed lens that cuts through the noise. Then, in a critical courtroom breakdown, of the first week of trial Laura, Lisa and Brian dive into the legal complexities of the Diddy trial\u2014from the potential impact of juror demographics on perceptions of consent to discussions about Diddy\u2019s deviant sexual psychopathology. Laura brings her decades of expertise into sharp focus\u2014connecting coercive control patterns to the real-world courtroom to help us all understand the warning signs that are often missed, help listeners understand, identify and avoid the traps abuser and spotlight how lawyers spin the narrative and blur the lines when defending abusive men.
