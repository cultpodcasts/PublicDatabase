      "title": "Olivia MacDonnell: What Surviving a Cult Taught Me About Healing",
      "description": "We sit down with Olivia MacDonell - entrepreneur, integration guide, and survivor of one of the most infamous religious cults of our time.\n\nBorn into the Children of God, Olivia shares her story of breaking free, rebuilding her identity, and turning trauma into purpose.\n\nFrom psychedelic healing to grief, addiction, community, and the long road back to self-trust, this conversation is raw, expansive, and deeply human.\nIt\u2019s a reminder that no matter where you come from, healing is possible - and that post-traumatic growth is real.\n\nOlivia is the founder of TAP Integration, the first software platform designed by and for psychedelic facilitators to support integration and aftercare. A passionate public speaker and community builder, Olivia has been at the forefront of transforming how we approach healing, blending cutting-edge technology with heart-centered facilitation. \n\nShe creates spaces\u2014both digital and in-person\u2014where people can deepen self-awareness, foster authentic connection, and turn insight into lasting change. Through TAP, her speaking engagements, and events like the ACT Conference, Olivia is redefining integration as a collective, accessible, and transformative practice.",
