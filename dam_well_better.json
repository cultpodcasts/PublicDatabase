      "title": "EPISODE 40: LEAVING THE CULT With Daniel Shaw, LCSW",
      "description": "(November 24, 2021)\n\nOn this episode, I talk to professional psychotherapist, Daniel Shaw about cult leader psychology and how exit therapy works. \n\nUnderstanding the psychology of the cult leader is key to understanding the cult itself and the trauma inflicted upon its members. We talk about who, exactly, these charismatic charlatans are and what is at the root of their narcissism. We also discuss the layers of therapy that must be applied - psychological, behavioral, physical, emotional and educational - in order to heal, post exit. \n\nThere are some very dangerous people out there with large followings right now. This is a must-listen if you want to understand how to spot a traumatizing narcissist and/or how to help a friend who is being abused by one.",
