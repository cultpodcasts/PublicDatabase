      "description": "I take a closer look at a topic I covered a few weeks ago: a video showing members of the Filipino CAFGU unit clashing with members of a militant Christian cult. What was supposed to be a tense but peaceful surrender took the worst possible turn.\n\nCoverage of the incident can\u0027t seem to agree if the cult\u0027s leader was one of the fallen, or if another mysterious man quoted in only two articles was the real leader.\n\nIn this part 2 to my \u0022The Filipino Cult Incident Video: Disturbing and Obscure Media\u0022 video, I examine the sources again, compare the evidence, and offer my opinions.\n\nDiscover lost, unusual, and disturbing media: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4Wo-jJHPG5lF9iaEQlqAQJ8IF2pPMiQ5\u0026si=d1VVyh9cYYt-gXCv\n\nDiscover internet mysteries and oddities: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4Wo-jJHPG5mpVW8Mn5WE4qEwDdgRQTBU\u0026si=3cNUZsXaaHJrlYum\n\nDive into unexplained mysteries: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4Wo-jJHPG5m72q7lM3CsQTYKZOevXoaj\u0026si=6NLmv38wUqGeg5l8\n\n#mystery #lostmedia #disturbing #internet #cult",

Not lost media, more like media you only found if you went looking for it.\n\nOne of these disturbing, obscure bits of media is a video showing members of the Filipino CAFGU unit clashing with members of a militant Christian cult.
