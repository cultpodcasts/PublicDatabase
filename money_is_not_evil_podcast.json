      "description": "Lilia Tarawa was brought up in the Gloriavale Christian Community on the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand, where she was constantly surrounded by everyone she loved. But over time, she began to see the dark side of her community, and ultimately realised that she had to get out. In this raw and emotional talk, Lilia shares the reality of life in a cult, and her heart-wrenching journey to break free. Lilia Tarawa is a New Zealand writer, speaker, holistic health consultant and business coach. She is a member of the M\u0101ori Ng\u0101i Tahu tribe. Lilia was born into New Zealand\u0027s infamous religious cult, Gloriavale, and fled with her eleven family members at eighteen years of age. Her extraordinary life experience compelled her to pursue a career promoting human rights, welfare and empowerment. --- Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/getu-chandler/support",
