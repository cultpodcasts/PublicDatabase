We\u0027re in the midst of a panic about Artificial Intelligence which has become a bogey-man. Some of our fears may prove to be justified, but there is also the sense that we simply don\u0027t understand where AI might lead. All strong emotions - fear, anger or joy - deplete our reasoning. How should we approach the over-stimulation that grabs our attention and panics our thinking?

Both agree that \u0027enlightenment\u0027 may be the wrong goal in life and that our relationships with others are paramount. Dr Moffic mentions recent work on long-term grief and post-traumatic growth. Jon brings up the cultural context of attitudes toward death and the work of the founding psychologist William James with the societies for psychical research and James\u0027s vital idea of \u0027feelings of knowing\u0027 that supplant the need for evidence and lead to false \u0027certainty\u0027 which can leave us vulnerable to demagogues who proffer \u0027certainty\u0027 in times of chaos.

      "description": "in 2003, John Hunter had a manic episode. When he attended a Large Group Awareness Training (LGAT) in 2010, he was surprised to find that the \u0027transformations\u0027 promised from this intense experience lined up with the symptoms of hypomania - the euphoric state that precedes full-blown mania in bipolar disorder. John completed his PhD with a dissertation on the role of dopamine in bipolar disorder/manic depression and the cogent idea that the dopamine system is sometimes hijacked to induce peak experiences. A fascinating new hypothesis that enhances our understanding of the irrational world of cultic involvement. ---------------- Links: John\u2019s doctoral dissertation  more on the Bear-Fedio index  religious figures and mania  the aberree online   ---------- More fascinating material from John Hunter:  his journal article on the dopaminergic defense hypothesis  A short article on LGATs published by the Psychological Society of South Africa  His illustrated essay on LGATs and Fight Club  -----------  Note (from Spike): The Temptation of St. Anthony by Hieronymus Bosch is one of my favorite paintings ever and the screencap here just doesn\u0027t do it justice.

John began to have doubts when he was 37 and started research that has continued for more than a decade. He is a prolific author who has revealed the intimate connection between some Pentecostalists - including Branham - with the Ku Klux Klan from its re-founding in 1915. He found links between Pentecostal Christianity and the Kardashian family; a Branham complex in Chile that smuggled Nazis into Argentina; the connection between Branham and Jim Jones who was responsible for the Jonestown killings; and even a connection to David \u0027Moses\u0027 Berg founder of the despicable child-molesting Children of God. A fascinating tour through one of the most influential groups in today\u0027s politicized religious right.

Jen found that this plague has touched many families in the US. It seems astonishing that a literate, intelligent man who spoke seven languages could have been pulled into this hateful echo chamber.

The aim of Two Wishes is to replace the adversarial approach to parental separation and focus on the needs of the children involved. Nick and Jon start by talking about aspects of coercive control as they relate to parental alienation, but, because this is our channel, the conversation cannot stick to one topic, and they move into education, history, AI, and the meaning of life.

      "description": "Anke Richter is one of the few journalists who has seriously researched authoritarian cults. Her own positive experience with a neo-tantra group helped her to understand the devastations caused by three very different cults: Centrepoint and Gloriavale in Aotearoa, New Zealand, and Agama Yoga in Thailand. Centrepoint was a free-love cult whose leaders were eventually imprisoned for sexual abuse and child sexual abuse. Gloriavale is a contemporary pseudo-Christian cult with bizarre sexual mores. Agama Yoga has been called the \u0027rape cult\u0027 and belongs to the neo-tantra movement - which promotes the notion of bliss or even enlightenment through sex. Anke gives readings from her well-researched and shocking book. A must-read that will become a classic.

Ten years later, Kelvin realized that the children were the greatest gift he\u0027d ever received and wanted to give something back. The couple helped to turn around an orphanage in Georgia.

Jon explains his own extensive research into the real foundations of hypnotic susceptibility. Hypnosis is not something done to us but an aspect of our everyday processing of the world.

      "description": "Harry Palmer transformed his Scientology Franchise into Avatar in the 1980s. Despite staff allegations of misconduct, he was able to create a worldwide movement with more members than the International Association of Scientologists. Ariela Sarai graduated from Columbia University in philosophy and religion and then spent six months working with Mother Theresa\u0027s outreach program before studying Tibetan Buddhism in the Dalai Lama\u0027s community. Returning to the US, she received a Master\u0027s in Social Work and was a practicing psychotherapist when therapist friends recruited her into Avatar; she was at the top of the organization by the time she left - after 21 years. Jon discusses the training methods - which borrow extensively from Scientology - the abuse within the group, and her departure and recovery from it. One of the most interesting chats on the channel!  Notes from Ariela:  -The Avatar courses were held in conference rooms in hotels with 200-4000 people from 50 countries attending. When we didn\u0027t have a student, we paid an internship fee of $650 plus hotel and airfare to teach the course. I was in the top inner circle, having daily contact with Harry Palmer\u0027s wife Avra Honey-Smith. I ran international teams, helping them recruit students and making sure they all had good results using the tools. I was on a course for 14-17 days per month.  -I am now a therapist with a full private practice, and I also work as a leadership coach at a Venture Capital firm. I am dedicated to helping people understand the tactics of manipulation and how to protect themselves and heal from this type of abuse. Although I don\u0027t actively seek to get people out of Avatar, I have helped many Avatars who reached out to me and needed help leaving and recovering.  -I am writing a memoir with my partner Mark to share our inner journey of this experience. I am also starting a Newsletter here.

      "description": "A review of the current court case in Los Angeles Criminal Courts where Danny Masterson is being tried for sexual assault. \u00A0\u00A0These are the TOP 5 points covered in this video: \u00A0\u00A0 1. Three women came forward to report the same incident to the Los Angeles Police Department: actor Danny Masterson had allegedly offered them a drink which made them semi-incapacitated, and then coerced them into physical relations.\u00A0 2. When one of these women reported the incident to a Scientology ethics officer she was told \u201CThere is no such thing as r*pe\u201D when you are in an intimate relationship. Another Ethics Officer told one of the women that she needed to supply physical intimacy to Danny on demand in EXCHANGE for living rent-free and having her meals paid for.\u00A0 3. Lisa Marie Presley, who was friendly with one of the women, was asked by Scientology staff to persuade her to NOT go to LAPD to report the assault. Lisa has subsequently apologized to the woman for doing this.\u00A0 4. Scientology (or any other cult) is ALWAYS the 3rd party, ever present in any intimate relationship and in Scn, anything voiced in counselling is carefully kept for blackmail, publication and control in the future.\u00A0 5. Jane Doe 4 was the fourth witness to Masterson\u2019s \u201Csignature\u201D of drugging before sexual assault. She had no \u201Cfish to fry\u201D \u2013 she wants no money from this case, only justice. \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Jon and Karen discuss details directly from court records. Journalist Tony Ortega has been faithfully transcribing the daily court prosecution and defense arguments at https://tonyortega.org for those who want to learn more. \u00A0\u00A0Note that Danny Masterson was in the Scientology for 40 years - this is an organization that takes \u201Cpride\u201D in their HIGH ETHICS and HIGH technology.",

He went on to work under David Miscavige for two decades as part of the culture of fear and violence generated by him.

Traditionalism is the simplistic creation of a golden age to support ideas of tribalism and racial purity. It has taken hold of populist movements and generated a new and ill-informed rightist upsurge. In the US, it is represented by Steve Bannon - who put Trump in the White House and was his first Chief of Staff; in Russia, by Alexander Dugin who preaches the re-unification of the Russian empire; and in Brazil by Olavo de Carvalho - Bolsanaro\u0027s guru. These pundits follow the teachings of Mussolini\u0027s advisor Julius Evola. They claim spiritual insight, but are ignorant of the subtle and complex ideas of true mysticism, instead grabbing beliefs in human decline - the End Days or Kali Yuga - as if they were prophetic truth, rather than bronze age anxieties. Mark and Jon show how traditions are often inventions to create tribalist separation between people. They offer some solutions to move us towards a pro-social, pro-human democracy that is neither left nor right wing.",

He told one of his assistants that the Empress dictated Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health\n24:53 In a 1949 letter, Hubbard told his literary agent he could rape women without them knowing it [the letter is on Tony Ortega\u2019s Underground Bunker, here: https://tonyortega.org/2014/10/23/l-ron-hubbard-explains-to-a-friend-the-real-reason-he-wrote-dianetics/ ]\n25:43 Steve Hall read the Affirmations at Scientology\u2019s Gold Base  [you can read more about this at the Bunker, here: https://tonyortega.org/2014/06/24/up-the-bridge-we-finally-reach-ot-8-but-was-its-first-version-really-a-hoax/ ]\n27:00 At any given time, there are at least a hundred staff at each major center waiting to leave following the tortuous \u201Crouting form\u201D which demands extensive \u201Csecurity checking\u201D on Scientology\u2019s lie-detector\n29:00.  On the original OT VIII Hubbard wrote that he is the Antichrist, Lucifer, and that Jesus was a \u201Clover of young men and boys\u201D\n33:00 It costs about $1 million to reach Scientology\u2019s highest level Scientology OT VIII. Only 184 Scientologists were invited onto OT VIII when it was released. Many left after seeing the material. \n35:48 Forty years after Omar Garrison was commissioned, Scientology is yet to release a Hubbard biography.\n37:00 David Miscavige has no checks and balances. He is the autocrat of Scientology and his word is law.\n39:24 Jon explains the long history of Hubbard\u2019s belief that he was the Antichrist Lucifer and his lifelong devotion to Aleister Crowley.\n40:49  Hubbard\u2019s ten-volume \u0022Mission Earth\u201D is significantly rewritten by Robert Vaughn Young, edited to remove incoherent and demented passages.\n41:00 Hubbard\u2019s devotion to Aleister Crowley [see Jon\u2019s Hubbard and the Occult, here: https://youtu.be/VJbZS9sfRF8 ].\n47:29 At the end of WWII, Hubbard moved in with Jack Parsons in Pasadena. They performed Sex Magick to find a woman who would give birth to the Whore of Babylon from the biblical Book of Revelation.\n52:00 Hubbard\u2019s determination to be seen as the creator God \u2013 the Source of the Universe\n54:00 Crowley\u2019s \u201CMoonchild\u201D \u2013 just like the Hubbard/Parsons\u2019 ritual\n56.00  Nibs Hubbard\u2019s secret autobiography \u0022The Telling of Me by Me\u0022 is vital to understanding his father.\n58:00 Nibs\u2019 claims that his father drugged, cut and raped female followers.\n1:00:00 A summary of OT VIII, Scientology\u2019s highest level.\n\nlinks:\n\nJack Parsons\u0027 writings: https://sacred-texts.com/oto/lib49.htm\nJon\u0027s paper on Hubbard and the occult: https://youtu.be/VJbZS9sfRF8\nthe full list of Hubbard\u0027s affirmations: https://gerryarmstrong.ca/the-affirmations-what-was-l-ron-hubbard-thinking/\nHubbard and black magick: https://youtu.be/2ILs6yB-d6A\nJon\u0027s \u0022Piece of Blue Sky\u0022: https://www.amazon.com/Lets-sell-these-people-Piece/dp/1482023032/\nJon\u0027s \u0022Cult of Greed: https://www.amazon.com/Scientology-Cult-Greed-Jon-Atack-ebook/dp/B00QVDPM62/",

Hubbard says: \u0022it\u2019s a \u0022MUST\u0022.\n5:00 Outing \u0022tag team\u0022 techniques.\n8:00 Threatening Clears that they are now at risk if they don\u0027t pay $40,000 immediately for their next levels (exorcism) is written in policy.\n10:45 Scientology, Inc is sitting with $3 billion in cash, but will extort every last dime without revealing they are Billionaires with ~ $4 billion stashed away.\n13:00 Scientology does not merely punish its staff; it humiliates and degrades the person to make them into a dot, while pretending they are taking people higher spiritually.\n18:15 Hubbard sent advice for John Axle to be spat on. Spitting became a thing to do in the SCN culture.  Seniors spat on juniors as a matter of course.\n22:10 the Mission Holder\u0027s conference catastrophe.  \n23.00 A new punishment Miscavige invented was that the targeted person had to lick the bathroom floor to white-glove standards with tongue.\n24.49 SCN cult craves ecclesiastical recognition and wants a CUT of your earnings - just like the mafia.\n28.00. Barbara\u0027s story. While the dead body of her husband was still in the morgue, four Sea Org members descended on her. They took everything, his pension, his life insurance, a mortgage on the home - they got it all and left at 4am with a million dollars.\n31:00 Sea Org member who was in for 40 years was thrown out when she could no longer work; she was descended on to do Super Power by a Sea Org gang and was told she would get re-implanted at death if she did not fork over 35,000 pounds.  She was forced to rebuy all the old books which got re-done; all her future pension was used up by this money extortion.\n34:00 Jon Atack\u0027s mom was also descended on by a gang for money extortion.\n37:00 It is standard practice to make completions re-do and recycle services they have already taken.  OT 8s are sent to re-do the entry program called Purification Rundown which is especially for heavy drug cases.\n39:00 Scn always makes you pay for counseling errors previously done. They admit to errors in their own tech. No such things as REFUNDS!\n41:00 So many were asking for money back that they opened a Refund Task Force.  The con is a loop around: you can\u0027t get your money back \u2018til you do the Claims Verification Board form, but you can\u0027t do the CVB form because you are declared a suppressive person.  \n43:00 Jon discusses shenanigans of the cult to the IRS.\n45:05 Two ex cops were hired by the cult to spy and surveil ex-SO member Pat Broeker for 24 years at the cost of MILLIONS of tax free money (501C 3), supposedly to be used for RELIGIOUS purposes.\n47:00 Scn cult makes hate sites calling long term ex-members criminal whereas they are the ULTIMATE criminal, whose intent is to HARM in any way they can, so long as they get your cash.\n51:00 the reason the San Luis Obispo coroner could identify the dead body as Hubbard\u0027s is because his fingerprints were on file for a previous arrest.\n54:00 A gang of four will arrive late at night and wear you down till they walk away with all you have in the bank plus future earnings: now you are in debt.  It\u2019s all about the cash.  Will that be Visa?  Master Card?  Amex?  Cash?\n\n\n\nlinks:\n\nshrinking world of L.Ron Hubbard: https://youtu.be/L_w-YWwC1lI\nTony\u0027s Chase Manhattan piece: https://tonyortega.org/2021/11/14/document-leak-did-the-chase-wave-cause-a-blacklisting-of-scientology/",

Heber was punished by being hurled into the freezing lake at St. Hill in November.\n23:52 Sea Org punishments consist of throwing people over the side of a ship.\n26:09 The story of David Miscavige punching his own preclear (auditing client) in the 1970s.

      "description": "NOTE: in order to fix a glitch, we had to re-upload this video. Our apologies for the inconvenience.\n\nA riot of mirth and logic. In March 2021, Jon gave three interviews to Andy Nolch, who claimed to have abandoned Scientology after looking at Jon\u2019s material. After the last interview, Jon found that Andy had been in prison so interviewed him about his convictions, his anti-feminism, his use of the hallucinogen ayahuasca, his Holocaust denial and his right-wing views. Andy put all of these videos on his Independent Scientology Podcast. A few months later, without contacting Jon, he put up \u201CJon Atack debunked\u201D (and accused Jon of being \u201Cpassive-aggressive\u201D!). \n\nAlthough the video is an hour and twenty minutes, Andy only mentions three concerns about Jon\u2019s work (all three are taken up in this video). However, Andy does provide a remarkable demonstration of the beliefs that come from \u2018weak\u2019 and \u2018circumstantial\u2019 evidence (Andy\u2019s own terms). Unless you agree with Andy\u2019s veneration of Trump and Putin, his disbelief in vaccines and global warning and his belief that Dan Brown\u2019s Da Vinci Code is history not fiction, then your views simply cannot be trusted. Jon and Sam comment on the tortuous construction of belief so often found among conspiracy theorists (Andy identifies as such). \n\nAndy Nolch now calls himself a \u201Chalf-Scientologist\u201D and says that Jon should have been able to persuade him otherwise. However, in his approach to Jon, Andy wrote:\n\u201CI love your stuff. I love the deep investigation and information. I was a Scientologists [sic] inside and outside the church for around 4 years each. Now I am a non believer. You helped wake me up to the truth about Scientology along with Hubbards [sic] contradictions \u2026 Would Jon like to be my very last interview?\u201D\n\nfor the original interviews:\npart one: https://youtu.be/mqFMtmiKNuU\npart two: https://youtu.be/U-I-xh0156Y\npart three: https://youtu.be/C5Fe-xQUloQ\n\nJon interviews Andy: https://youtu.be/SQ671RiXANE\n\nThis is a response to Andy Nolch\u2019s \u201Cdebunking\u201D of Jon. We\u2019ll also put up Jon\u2019s talk with Eddie Stratton, discussing whether to respond to people with abhorrent beliefs.\n\nWe have some requests for Andy, to clarify the claims he made in his debunk video:\nWhat is the difference between \u201Cbrainwashing\u201D and \u201Cconditioning\u201D?\n\nPlease read Brian Deer\u2019s The Doctor Who Fooled the World and offer any evidence that the MMR vaccine has caused regressive autism.\n\nYou dislike \u201Clefties\u201D, but don\u2019t seem to realize that George Orwell (Eric Blair) was a committed leftie. Please explain.\n\nPlease produce a gene test to show what \u201Crace\u201D you belong to.\n\nWhere did Hitler offer to stop using Jews as slaves if the Allies would end the war?\n\nWhich camp did your great-grandfather die in?\n\nWhere in Europe was your grandfather? Did he visit the sites of any of the concentration and death camps?\n\nPlease provide evidence that the New Zealand press were given Lee Harvey Oswald\u2019s name before he was arrested.\n\nPlease provide an authenticated IQ test to prove your assertion that you are a \u201Cgenius\u201D.\n\n\nFor recommended links, please see the pinned comment.",

Jon\u2019s Let\u2019s Sell These People a Piece of Blue Sky is called Hubbard Through the Looking Glass in the bibliography of Russell Miller\u2019s excellent Bare-Faced Messiah, because Hubbard turns out to be the very opposite of the liberator of humanity \u2013 his whole objective was to enslave people, and he did a spectacular job!

O\u2019Brien was the head of the Hubbard Association of Scientologists and arranged the Philadelphia \u2018Doctorate\u2019 Course in 1952. Hubbard wrote his infamous letter about adopting the \u2018religion angle\u2019 to her (she shared these letters with Jon and was one of 150 people who contributed to his research). Jon explains some of his own involvement \u2013 including taking the \u2018upper levels\u2019, auditor training and the Data Series Evaluator Course. Jon explains that contrary to popular belief his work has been to help Scientologists, so he is not an \u2018anti-Scientologist\u2019.

There is another good reason for learning one\u0027s Latin and Greek, which was often brought up by my professors in graduate school as they bemoaned the lack of these languages being taught in high schools: once students know their Greek and Latin roots, they are able to figure out *for themselves* a good chunk of any scientific jargon and medical terminology, as such terms are invariably in these languages (it\u0027s also the reason I had to learn German and Italian as a voice student, so I could understand the arias I was singing).\n\n_________________________\nbuy your own copy of Jon\u0027s classic book, Let\u0027s Sell These People a Piece of Blue Sky: https://www.amazon.com/Lets-sell-these-people-Piece-ebook/dp/B00BF385HG/ (now FREE with Kindle Unlimited!)\n\nTo buy a copy of Jon\u0027s Book, \u0022Opening Our Minds\u0022 on Kindle or in paperback!

The two friends reflect on such nonsensical jewels as \u0022space is a viewpoint of dimension\u0022 and other Hubbardian tautologies. Jon reminds all of us that, as Tom Stoppard once observed, \u201Cyou can persuade a man to believe almost anything \u2013 provided he\u2019s clever enough.\u201D Chris and Jon discuss how intelligent, empathetic people were drawn into the web of Hubbard\u0027s nonsensical system, using all their imagination and intellect to make sense of the chaos, convincing themselves of meaning where none had existed before.

Ed and Jon talk about the original list, Robert Hare\u0027s update, Hubbard\u0027s points and Jon\u0027s model of the human predator.\n\nCleckley\u0027s checklist: 1. Considerable superficial charm and average or above average intelligence.\n2. Absence of delusions and other signs of irrational thinking.\n3. Absence of anxiety or other \u201Cneurotic\u201D symptoms. Considerable poise, calmness and verbal facility.\n4. Unreliability, disregard for obligations, no sense of responsibility, in matters of little and great import.\n5. Untruthfulness and insincerity.\n6. Antisocial behavior which is inadequately motivated and poorly planned, seeming to stem from an inexplicable impulsiveness.\n7. Inadequately motivated antisocial behavior.\n8. Poor judgment and failure to learn from experience.\n9. Pathological egocentricity. Total self-centeredness and an incapacity for real love and attachment.\n10. General poverty of deep and lasting emotions.\n11. Lack of any true insight; inability to see oneself as others do.\n12. Ingratitude for any special considerations, kindness and trust.\n13. Fantastic and objectionable behavior, after drinking and sometimes even when not drinking. Vulgarity, rudeness, quick mood shifts, pranks for facile entertainment.\n14. No history of genuine suicide attempts.\n15. An impersonal, trivial, and poorly integrated sex life.\n16. Failure to have a life plan and to live in any ordered way  (unless it is for destructive purposes or a sham).   \n\nJon\u0027s human predator model: \n\u2022 Human predators are mean.\n\u2022 Predators are utterly selfish. \n\u2022 Predators pretend friendship and love but they feel absolutely nothing for others. \n\u2022 Predators are charming and good at flattery, but they don\u2019t mean a single word of it. \n\u2022 Predators brag and boast and make up outrageous lies. When challenged, they blame others. \n\u2022 Predators don\u2019t feel anxiety or fear or are deeply anxious and cowardly.\n\u2022 Predators are impulsive and easily bored. They demand thrills and take dangerous risks. They enjoy pushing others into taking dangerous risks, too.\n\u2022 Predators are bullies with explosive tempers. \n\u2022 Predators enjoy humiliating people. \n\u2022 Predators hate it if anyone else has power or is praised. For the predator, life is a competition and they want to win.\n\u2022 Predators weaken people with insults and putdowns.\n\u2022 Predators are cunning and manipulative. \n\u2022 Predators lie easily and think nothing of breaking a promise.\n\u2022 Predators are without conscience: they do not feel remorse or guilt.\n\u2022 Predators often boast about the harm they\u2019ve done to other people.\n\u2022 Predators are parasites. They are lazy and live off others, giving as little as possible in return.\n\u2022 Predators are control freaks, stopping others from taking control of anything if they can\n\u2022 Predators force petty rules on others \u2013 rules that are impossible to follow.\n\u2022 Predators boast about tricking other people.\n\u2022 Predators boast about breaking the law.\n\n\n\nAnd on a lighter note - \u0022wearing a loud shirt in a built-up area\u0022 \nhttps://youtu.be/BO8EpfyCG2Y\n\n___________________\n\nTo buy your own copy of Jon\u0027s classic book, Let\u0027s Sell These People a Piece of Blue Sky: https://www.amazon.com/Lets-sell-these-people-Piece-ebook/dp/B00BF385HG/ (now FREE with Kindle Unlimited!)\n\nTo buy a copy of Jon\u0027s Book, \u0022Opening Minds\u0022: https://www.amazon.com/opening-minds-manipulation-influence-brainwashing-ebook/dp/B01LYWEPJV/\n\n---------------------------------\n\nCheck out our Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/jonatack \n\nor for a one-time donation, use our PayPal link!: https://www.paypal.me/jonatackandfriends \n\nfollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/atack_jon\nand Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/openmindstoday/ \n\nfor respectful, insightful, and engaging discussion on coercive control, manipulation, abusive groups and individuals, and more, join our facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/803202686721445/ (for faster acceptance to the group, please answer the \u201Cprove you\u2019re not a \u2018bot\u201D questions)",

Because of this, a mass of destructive, unhelpful misconceptions has arisen in the public mind, myths about coercive control that need to be debunked.

      "description": "An astonishing series of revelations about Scientology\u0027s abuse of its members. Mike Rinder describes his arrival on Scientology\u0027s flagship the \u00A0Apollo at the tender age of 18. Sent from Australia for management training, after handing over his passport, he found he\u0027d been traded in a \u00A0typical case of Scientology\u0027s human trafficking. Conditions for the \u0022elite\u0022 Sea Org under Hubbard\u0027s direct control were deplorable. As Mike says, the former cattle hold which had become the men\u0027s dorm was like \u0022the black hole of Calcutta\u0022 and the food was \u0022garbage\u0022. Mike was tasked with \u0022baby-watching\u0022 the first victim of the Introspection Rundown (on which Lisa McPherson later died), which Hubbard claimed would cure insanity. Mike was also the only Scientologist left on the island of \u00A0Madeira after the notorious \u0022rock festival\u0022, where locals hurled bricks \u00A0and cobblestones at the Apollo, and was lucky to escape with his life. links: ex-Scientology kids: http://exscientologykids.com the Aftermath Foundation: http://theaftermathfoundation.org",

      "description": "An astonishing series of revelations about Scientology\u0027s abuse of its members. Mike Rinder describes his arrival on Scientology\u0027s flagship the Apollo at the tender age of 18. Sent from Australia for management training, after handing over his passport, he found he\u0027d been traded in a typical case of Scientology\u0027s human trafficking. Conditions for the \u0022elite\u0022 Sea Org under Hubbard\u0027s direct control were deplorable. As Mike says, the former cattle hold which had become the men\u0027s dorm was like \u0022the black hole of Calcutta\u0022 and the food was \u0022garbage\u0022. Mike was tasked with \u0022baby-watching\u0022 the first victim of the Introspection Rundown (on which Lisa McPherson later died), which Hubbard claimed would cure insanity. Mike was also the only Scientologist left on the island of Madeira after the notorious \u0022rock festival\u0022, where locals hurled bricks and cobblestones at the Apollo, and was lucky to escape with his life.\n\nlinks:\nex-Scientology kids: http://exscientologykids.com\nthe Aftermath Foundation: http://theaftermathfoundation.org\n\n------------------------------------\n\nTo buy your own copy of Jon\u0027s classic book, Let\u0027s Sell These People a Piece of Blue Sky: https://www.amazon.com/Lets-sell-these-people-Piece-ebook/dp/B00BF385HG/ (now FREE with Kindle Unlimited!)\n\nTo buy a copy of Jon\u0027s Book, \u0022Opening Minds\u0022: https://www.amazon.com/opening-minds-manipulation-influence-brainwashing-ebook/dp/B01LYWEPJV/\n\n---------------------------------\n\nCheck out our Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/jonatack \n\nor for a one-time donation, use our PayPal link!: https://www.paypal.me/jonatackandfriends \n\nfollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/atack_jon\nand Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/openmindstoday/ \n\nfor respectful, insightful, and engaging discussion on coercive control, manipulation, abusive groups and individuals, and more, join our facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/803202686721445/ (for faster acceptance to the group, please answer the \u201Cprove you\u2019re not a \u2018bot\u201D questions)",

      "description": "Mike Rinder was head of Scientology\u2019s sophisticated harassment \u00A0department for 20 years. In this stunning interview he describes the \u00A0fanatical determination to utterly ruin anyone who questions Hubbard\u0027s \u00A0work as a \u0027Supppressive Person\u0027, an \u0027enemy\u0027 of humanity. That included \u00A0Jon, when they last spoke in the mid-90s. Mike shows the secret Hubbard \u00A0documents that direct the harassment of \u0027Suppressives\u0027 and describes in \u00A0chilling detail the activities of the Office of Special Affairs which is \u00A0now trying to silence him with a typical smear campaign. In the 80s and \u00A090s there were only a handful of persistent critics, but now thousands \u00A0are speaking out, so Scientology no longer has the resources to harass \u00A0any but its most vocal critics. These include Mike Rinder who has become \u00A0Scientology\u0027s most dangerous former insider. \u00A0\u00A0 We urge you to join the #IGotOut campaign! \u00A0\u00A0 for Chris Owens\u0027 research and papers on Scientology: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/ \u00A0for Jon\u0027s paper, \u0022Scientology: religion or intelligence agency?\u0022: http://home.snafu.de/tilman/j/berlin.html?fbclid=IwAR3G8FA_m_jpw1sqwJLRTPtqlT8vTONCYInPmOlZ5yDPQVsNQeY8aNRAMto \u00A0 Mike Rinder\u0027s blogpost on Scientology\u0027s harassment procedures: https://www.mikerindersblog.org/dealing-with-critics-of-scientology-the-l-ron-hubbard-playbook/ \u00A0 for the documentary, \u0022the Shrinking World of L.

      "description": "Chris Shelton quizzes Jon about Erich Fromm\u2019s views on authoritarianism, freedom, narcissism, and the development of an independent self as the aim of life. Erich Fromm escaped Germany in 1933 when Hitler took power. He was a social psychologist and counsellor who wrote a series of best-selling books. Chris and Jon discuss this passage from Fromm\u2019s \u0022Man For Himself\u0022:\n\nThe duty of recognizing the authority\u2019s superiority results in several prohibitions. The most comprehensive of these is the tabu against feeling oneself to be, or ever able to become, like the authority, for this would contradict the latter\u2019s unqualified superiority and uniqueness. The real sin of Adam and Eve is, as has been pointed out before, the attempt to become like \nGod; and it is as punishment for this challenge and simultaneously as a deterrence of a repetition of it that they are expelled from the Garden of Eden. In authoritarian systems the authority is made out to be fundamentally different from his subjects. He has powers not attainable by anyone else: magic, wisdom, strength which can never by matched by his subjects. Whatever the authority\u2019s prerogatives are, whether he is the master of the universe or a unique leader sent by fate, the fundamental inequality between him and man is the basic tenet of authoritarian conscience. One particularly important aspect of the uniqueness of the authority is the privilege of being the only one who does not follow another\u2019s will, but who himself wills; who is not a means but an end in himself; who creates and is not created. In the authoritarian orientation, the power of will and creation are the privilege of the authority. Those subject to him are means to his end, and, consequently, his property and used by him for his own purposes. The supremacy of the authority is questioned by the attempt of the creature to cease being a *thing* and to become a creator.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\ntake the Levenson index: https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/LSRP.php \n\nvisit the V-Taiwan project page: https://info.vtaiwan.tw\n------------------------------------------\n\nTo buy your own copy of Jon\u0027s classic book, Let\u0027s Sell These People a Piece of Blue Sky: https://www.amazon.com/Lets-sell-these-people-Piece-ebook/dp/B00BF385HG/ (now FREE with Kindle Unlimited!)\n\nTo buy a copy of Jon\u0027s Book, \u0022Opening Minds\u0022: https://www.amazon.com/opening-minds-manipulation-influence-brainwashing-ebook/dp/B01LYWEPJV/\n\n---------------------------------\n\nCheck out our Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/jonatack \n\nor for a one-time donation, use our PayPal link!: https://www.paypal.me/jonatackandfriends \n\nfollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/atack_jon\nand Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/openmindstoday/ \n\nfor respectful, insightful, and engaging discussion on coercive control, manipulation, abusive groups and individuals, and more, join our facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/803202686721445/ (for faster acceptance to the group, please answer the \u201Cprove you\u2019re not a \u2018bot\u201D questions)",

We should reward the good, name and shame the bad, and move forward into a more equitable state of justice for all.\n \nIn that spirit, we suggest the hashtag #copsintegritymatters - to encourage people to hold the police of all countries to account, and create a world where the justice system works for the people, and not against us. We also advocate more public acknowledgement of the difficult and challenging work that many police officers do, and suggest that good police departments show the bad ones how to support the law rather than their law-breaking associates.",

In love the paradox occurs that two beings become one and yet remain two.\u2019 \n\nJon and Sam discuss this and a few more choice passages of this classic work, and manage to include a fascinating tangential discussion about the decriminalization of cannabis for medical research.\nSam picked the Erich Fromm quotes.\n--------------\n\u2018The Canadian parliament had criminalized cannabis \u2026 following the publication of The Black Candle \u2026 [that] spewed out venom about the \u201Cdregs of humanity\u201D \u2026 all marijuana users are \u201Cnon-white and non-Christian, wanting only to seduce white women.\u201D [the author] warned of \u201Can international conspiracy of yellow and black drug pushers\u201D whose ultimate goal is \u201Cthe domination of the bright proud races of the world.\u201D [Marijuana] has the effect of driving them completely insane.

      "description": "In this final installment of a three-part series on recovery, Jon is joined by our friend Chris Shelton, to talk about the stages of recovery from Scientology, destructive cults, or any authoritarian, abusive group or relationship.\n\nHere is the list Jon and Chris are working from:\n\n1. A history of subjection to totalitarian control over a prolonged period (months to years). Examples include hostages, prisoners of war, concentration camp survivors, and survivors of some religious cults. [Authors\u2019 note: We would remove the word \u0027religious\u0027 so as to include all systems of thought reform.] Examples also include those subjected to totalitarian systems in sexual and domestic life, including survivors of domestic battering, childhood physical or sexual abuse, and organized sexual exploitation.\n \n2. Alterations in affect regulation, including\n\u00B7      persistent dysphoria\n\u00B7      chronic suicidal preoccupation\n\u00B7      self-injury\n\u00B7      explosive or extremely inhibited anger (may alternate)\n\u00B7      compulsive or extremely inhibited sexuality (may alternate)\n \n3. Alterations in consciousness, including\n\u00B7      amnesia or hypermnesia for traumatic events\n\u00B7      transient dissociative episodes\n\u00B7      depersonalization/derealization\n\u00B7      reliving experiences, either in the form of intrusive post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms or in the form of ruminative preoccupation\n \n4. Alteration in self-perception, including\n\u00B7      sense of helplessness or paralysis of initiative\n\u00B7      shame, guilt, and self-blame\n\u00B7      sense of defilement or stigma\n\u00B7      sense of complete difference from others (may include a sense of specialness, utter aloneness, belief no other person can understand, or nonhuman identity)\n \n5. Alterations in perception of perpetrator, including\n\u00B7      preoccupation with relationship with perpetrator (includes preoccupation with revenge)\n\u00B7      unrealistic attribution of total power to perpetrator (caution: victim\u2019s assessment of power realities may be more realistic than clinician\u2019s)\n\u00B7      idealization or paradoxical gratitude\n\u00B7      sense of special or supernatural relationship\n\u00B7      acceptance of belief system or rationalizations of perpetrator\n \n6. Alterations in relations with others, including\n\u00B7      isolation and withdrawal\n\u00B7      disruption of intimate relationships\n\u00B7      repeated search for rescuer (may alternate with isolation and withdrawal)\n\u00B7      persistent distrust\n\u00B7      repeated failures of self-protection\n \n7. Alterations in systems of meaning\n\u00B7      loss of sustaining faith\n\u00B7      sense of hopelessness and despair\n\n--------------------------\nTo buy your own copy of Jon\u0027s classic book, Let\u0027s Sell These People a Piece of Blue Sky: https://www.amazon.com/Lets-sell-these-people-Piece-ebook/dp/B00BF385HG/ (now FREE with Kindle Unlimited!)\n\nTo buy Chris\u0027 book, A to Xenu - an insider\u0027s guide to Scientology: https://www.amazon.com/Scientology-Insiders-Guide-Really-About-ebook/dp/B019S20FLO/\n\nAnd check out Chris\u0027 Channel here: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF326xyA0QHI7Z5xAwKQDJg\nChris\u0027 website: https://mncriticalthinking.com\n\nFor more information on Scientology, see\nTony Ortega\u0027s Underground Bunker - https://tonyortega.org\nOperation Clambake: http://www.xenu.net\nLermanet: http://www.lermanet.org\n\n------------------------------------------------ \nCheck out our Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/jonatack \n\nor for a one-time donation, use our PayPal link!: https://www.paypal.me/jonatackandfriends \n\nfollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/minds_opening \nand Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/openmindstoday/ \n\nfor respectful, insightful, and engaging discussion on coercive control, manipulation, abusive groups and individuals, and more, join our facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/803202686721445/ (for faster acceptance to the group, please answer the \u201Cprove you\u2019re not a \u2018bot\u201D questions)",

      "description": "Bonnie and Jon have been close friends since 1991. Bonnie left Scientology after taking all of the available \u201Cupper levels\u201D and training to Class IV. She had directed Scientology Apple Schools and been Director of Processing at the American Saint Hill Organization. Bonnie and her husband Richard worked closely with Jon in the early 1990s before setting up Escape to help former members. \n\nBonnie and Richard endured seven years of litigation for handing out the leaflet \u201CWhat the Scientologists don\u2019t tell you\u201D. For a revised version, see this link: https://www.facebook.com/notes/jon-atack/what-the-scientologists-dont-tell-you-a-pamphlet-by-bonnie-woods/904278513351578/\n\nThis leaflet proved effective in closing down both the East Grinstead Dianetic Book Shop and the Chichester Scientology Mission, when street recruiters were tagged by local Christians who handed the leaflet to everyone approached by the recruiter. Eventually, the Scientologists withdrew their case, apologized in in the London High Court, paid \u00A355,000 in damages, the costs of the action and made an undertaking that Richard and Bonnie can say whatever they like based upon the voluminous documents used in court discovery.\n \nlink: http://www.escapeint.org/legal/apology.htm\n\n__________________________________________________________\nlinks to books mentioned in the video:\nBare-Faced Messiah - https://www.amazon.com/Bare-Faced-Messiah-True-Story-Hubbard-ebook/dp/B07H182V4G/\n\nDeceived: One Woman\u0027s Stand Against the Church of Scientology - https://www.amazon.com/Deceived-Womans-against-Church-Scientology/dp/1903905214/\n\nDianetics in Limbo - http://www.xenu.net/archive/books/dil/Dianetics_in_Limbo.txt\n\nThe Mind Benders: https://www.amazon.com/Mind-benders-Scientology-Cyril-Vosper/dp/0854350616/\n\nTroublemaker: https://www.amazon.com/Troublemaker-Surviving-Hollywood-and-Scientology/dp/B01604H1DI/\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nFor more information see: Jon Atack, Let\u0027s sell these people A Piece of Blue Sky; Jenna Miscavige-Hill, Beyond Belief; Marc Headley, Blown for Good; Margery Wakefield, The Road to Xenu; John Duignan, The Complex; Lawrence Wright, Going Clear; Bent Corydon with Brian Ambry, L.

Finally, almost three years ago he moved his clock to a delayed sleep-wake phase - sleeping eight hours, but waking after noon - and the many and overwhelming symptoms accredited to chronic fatigue syndrome/ME turned out to be sleep deprivation and faded within weeks. Delayed sleep-wake phase affects as many as 25% of people - many also have advanced wake-phase - and goes almost unnoticed in the medical world, where many adolescents are probably misdiagnosed as Sam was, and in the UK schools \u0027learning centres\u0027 are packed with drowsy children whose education is being wrecked - along with their health and their confidence.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nCheck out our Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/jonatack \n\nor for a one-time donation, use our PayPal link!: https://www.paypal.me/jonatackandfriends \n\nfollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/minds_opening \nand Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/openmindstoday/ \n\nfor respectful, insightful, and engaging discussion on coercive control, manipulation, abusive groups and individuals, and more, join our facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/803202686721445/ (for faster acceptance to the group, please answer the \u201Cprove you\u2019re not a \u2018bot\u201D questions)",

The charismatic rock star propels Big into a cult group, where members believe themselves to be members of the lost Cherokee Kanasta tribe. Their new leader, former dominatrix Wasp Tongue, reclaims the magical Ulunsuti crystal, and sets about revenging the Cherokee on the White world.\n\nBig teams up with Peter, a brilliant fifteen-year-old musician who has grown up in the cult and longs to escape it. Big also falls head over heels in love with Beloved Woman, the daughter of the cult\u2019s recently demised founder, Wide Eye.\n\nBig tumbles through a series of dreams and visions, discovering strange facets of Jimi Hendrix\u2019s life, fragments of Cherokee lore, and bits of Blues legend. Ultimately, this journey leads to the resolution of his own retreat from life and relationships.\n\n___________________________________________",

Although the 1944 film with Ingrid Bergman and Charles Boyer is the best-known, I prefer the 1940 version with Diana Wynard and Anton Walbrook, simply because Walbrook is much better at being totally evil. However, the 1944 film is also worth a look, if only for Angela Lansbury\u0027s first film appearance at age 19 as Nancy, the parlormaid. You can find the 1940 version here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYmtzaHwCKo - and check out my article on gaslighting, here: https://www.openmindsfoundation.org/gaslighting-how-predators-take-control-by-turning-down-the-lights/\n\nfor more information on how cult leaders think, including the complete list of traits, check out jon\u0027s article here: \nhttps://www.openmindsfoundation.org/faces_of_undue_influence/what-is-manipulation/human-predator/\n\nfor more on how high-control groups recruit and abuse intelligent people, visit the open minds foundation website, here: https://www.openmindsfoundation.org\n\nfollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/minds_opening\nand Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/openmindstoday/\n\nfor respectful, insightful, and engaging discussion on coercive control, manipulation, abusive groups and individuals, and more, join our facebook group:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/803202686721445/\n(for faster acceptance to the group, please answer the \u201Cprove you\u2019re not a \u2018bot\u201D questions)\n\nand check out jon\u2019s book, opening minds: https://www.amazon.com/opening-minds-manipulation-influence-brainwashing-ebook/dp/B01LYWEPJV/",
