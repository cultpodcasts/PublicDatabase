Almost a hundred pupils thought they\u0027d been poisoned by the Russians. It took two years for them all to be released from hospital as a cognitive therapist helped them to understand the condition.\n\nHistory has seen many examples of the madness of crowds - the Salem Witch Trials or those described by Huxley in The Devils of Loudon (filmed as The Devils), but are all human groups to some extent carriers of crazy ideas?\nDr Moffic brings his lifetime as a therapist and his experience as a social psychiatrist to bear on the question.\n\nbuy Jon\u0027s book, Opening Our Minds: Avoiding Abusive Relationships and Authoritarian Groups https://www.amazon.com/Opening-Our-Minds-relationships-authoritarian-ebook/dp/B08YGTJW4P/\n\nMore on gender in Judaism: https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-eight-genders-in-the-talmud/ \n\nSee Jon on Ladbible: https://youtu.be/sPpKgU2zT-4?si=H16lhk8uW21cHJWv\n\n Jon is deeply indebted to Khapta Akhmedova for her painstaking help with this chapter.  For a detailed account of mass hysteria, see Aldous Huxley, The Devils of Loudon, which was the basis for Ken Russell\u2019s stylish film, The Devils. Arthur Miller\u2019s play, The Crucible, deals with the Salem witch trials and is also available in two film versions.",

It focuses on sexual intimacy with the promise of spiritual transformation. Cara gives a fascinating account of her eight-year marriage to a one-on-on guru, who claimed to be descended from both Mesmer and Gurdjieff. She then relates her intriguing experiences with ISTA which breaks down sexual barriers as an LGAT.\n\n Cara now questions the ethics and possible negative consequences of ISTA as well as ISTA\u0027s refusal to take responsibility for those consequences or change practices that can have harmful consequences. Dave has a long experience of LGATs. They are part of a discussion about the ethics and efficacy of LGATs and are in discussion with others who have worked as trainers to see if there is an ethical framework in which group encounter can be safely and productively applied.\n\nLinks:\n\nKorean Mock \u0022Funerals\u0022 for a better life - https://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyle/dying-for-a-better-life-south-koreans-fake-their-funerals-for-life-lessons-idUSKBN1XG037/\n\nIra Chaleff\u0027s work on Courageous Followership and Intelligent Disobedience - https://irachaleffauthor.com\n\nLippman\u0027s Socrates for Six-Year-Olds - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2B6661C0B0CF7C98\n\nMore on the Bear-Fedio index - https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11020039\n\nMore on Decult - https://decult.net",

Wikipedia tells us LGATs \u0027may compromise participants\u0027 mental wellbeing\u0027. \n\nDr John Hunter realized that the LGAT he attended at his boss\u0027s request claimed the symptoms of hypomania (excessive elation) as \u0027transformations\u0027. After two decades of research, John has published an excellent book suggesting that LGATs and many other forms of conversion use stress and humiliation to generate the brain\u0027s reward chemical dopamine which is then released in a gush of elation - hypomania.\n\nStudies have shown that these euphoric states are transient and often result in broken marriages and careers as well as mental breakdowns and even psychosis.\n\nJohn\u0027s new book is a vital insight into the ways in which even highly intelligent people\u0027s critical thinking is bypassed. He argues that many religious conversions may be based in this simple neurological process.

      "description": "Our friend, the Amazing Wise Beard Man Mark Bunker, recently remastered Charlie Nairn\u0027s classic documentary in 4K and has kindly given us permission to mirror it from his excellent channel. \n\nSee Mark\u0027s channel here: https://www.youtube.com/@UCkohIipYvmCarOriMY1GT9g \n\nThis is the single most important interview of Hubbard. Jon bargained for a copy from the Granada TV archives in 1987. Over the decades, he\u0027s played it to many former members and watched as their perception of Hubbard changed - he had a first and a third wife, but \u0027no second wife\u0027. He had no bank accounts in Switzerland, but one bank account in Switzerland. He pauses when asked about his belief in reincarnation, but readily admits that his followers believe. \n\nWhen Jon first spoke to the documentary\u0027s maker, Charlie Nairn, some years ago, he told Jon that before the camera rolled, Hubbard candidly admitted that Scientology is a scam. Asked why he\u0027d created it, he said he liked to be able to tell his wife at the end of every day that they\u0027d made another ten thousand dollars, but that, most of all, he liked to \u0022catch the clever ones and reel them in.\u0022 Like any malevolent ten-year-old. \n\nThis documentary has probably done more good than any other piece of work on Scientology (including Jon\u0027s own) and Charlie Nairn deserves plaudits, medals and prizes for filming it. Our gratitude to Mark Bunker for making it more accessible in this sparkling new form. Thanks!",

Hoyt is concerned about the infighting in the wide world of survivors. Jon adds reflections from his four decades of work with former members.\nMany people leave an authoritarian group and deny the harm it did to them and the harm they did to others because of their cult beliefs. They may then descend into rage against the group rather than feeling compassion for its victims. Often, members don\u0027t understand the manipulative methods they have acquired during membership and continue to act aggressively and self-righteously.\n\nHoyt and Jon propose ways of overcoming the toxic residue of cult involvement, where the world-saving deceptions of the group turn to saving the world from the group rather than helping members to escape and recover.\n\nJon\u0027s response to Zeller\u0027s \u0022review\u0022 of Cult of Trump (the publicity flyer)\nhttps://jonatack.co.uk/response-to-benjamin-zellers-review-the-cult-of-trump-what-cult-rhetoric-actually-reveals/",

The good doctor asks if gratitude is relevant to cult involvement. Perhaps sociopathy can be seen as a lack of gratitude?\n\nNote: \nFrom Abraham Lincoln Online: \n\u0022Prior to this, each state scheduled its own Thanksgiving holiday at different times, mainly in New England and other Northern states. President Lincoln responded to Mrs. Hale\u0027s request immediately, unlike several of his predecessors, who ignored her petitions altogether. In her letter to Lincoln she mentioned that she had been advocating a national thanksgiving date for 15 years as the editor of Godey\u0027s Lady\u0027s Book. George Washington was the first president to proclaim a day of thanksgiving, issuing his request on October 3, 1789, exactly 74 years before Lincoln\u0027s.\u0022\n\nhttps://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/thanks.htm\n\nLinks:\nZimbardo\u0027s Heroic Imagination Project: https://www.heroicimagination.org\n\nThe Mendota Study: https://wiatsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/T-30-Whispering-to-Psychopaths.pdf",

On February 27, just six days before parliamentary elections, the Reichstag \u2013 the parliament \u2013 burned down. The next day, Hitler issued a decree to imprison his political opponents in concentration camps, announcing that the fire was just the first terrorist act in a planned civil war.\nThe Nazis declared that they could arrest and hold anyone without charge, enter any private home, open mail and listen into phone calls, curb free speech, prevent public assembly and end freedom of association. These rules lasted until the surrender of the German Reich twelve years later.\nHitler\u2019s minions had to scramble to create a legal justification for their unprecedented take-over. Former president Trump has told us he will use the existing Sedition Act to imprison his critics.\nHitler unleashed his stormtroopers on the Night of Broken Glass in November 1938. More than 600 Jews were murdered and 30,000 were sent to concentration camps. Trump has expressed his anti-Semitism, saying the Jews will be to blame if he is not elected. He will release his own stormtroopers \u2013 the Insurrectionists \u2013 from prison and can gather other right-wing sympathisers for a \u2018day of violence.\u2019 He has called American politicians the \u2018enemy within\u2019 and said he\u2019ll use the US military against them.\nTrump has confirmed every one of these statements. They are not jests and they are not metaphors: he insists that he means what he says.\nTrump has promised dictatorship on \u2018day one.\u2019 He has promised retribution against his critics with internment and a day of violence. How quickly could the United States descend into a national socialist reich? It only took Germany 28 days.",

      "description": "Jeremy gifts us some of his new words that portmanteau concepts. Criticism of Malkin\u0027s model of narcissism (\u0027feeling special\u0027) and Jeremy\u0027s embrace of the doctrine of foregone inconclusions. A delight for the eager mind.\n\nJeremy\u0027s Book, Neither Ghost Nor Machine, can be bought here:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Neither-Ghost-nor-Machine-Emergence/dp/0231173334/\n\nNotes:\nFrom Scouting for Boys, 1908: \u201CThe practice is called \u2018self-abuse\u2019. And the result of self-abuse is always - mind you, always - that the boy after a time becomes weak and nervous and shy, he gets headaches and probably also palpitations of the heart, and if he still carries it on too far he very often goes out of his mind and becomes an idiot.\nThe use of your parts is not to play with when you are a boy but to enable you to get children when you are grown up and married. But if you misuse them while young you will not be able to use them when you are a man: they will not work then.\nSo for all reasons be on the look out against this temptation, it is easier to stop it at first than when it becomes a habit. The next time you feel the desire coming on don\u0027t give way to it; resist it. If you have the chance just wash your parts in cold water and cool them down. Wet dreams come from it especially after eating rich food, or too much meat, or from sleeping with too warm a blanket over your body or in too soft a bed or from sleeping on your back. Therefore avoid all these.\nAvoid listening to stories or reading or thinking about dirty subjects. You will soon find that the temptation will not worry you so much. Be strong and don\u0027t give way to it.\u201D\n\nAnd this, from Scouting For Boys, 1911:\nIn this chapter much has been said of the active measures which a boy should take in order to become strong and well. We should be equally concerned in saving and storing up natural forces we already have. In the body of every boy, who has reached his teens, the Creator of the universe has sown a very important fluid. This fluid is the most wonderful material in all the physical world. Some parts of it find their way into the blood, and through the blood give tone to the muscles, power to the brain, and strength to the nerves. This fluid is the sex fluid. When this fluid appears in a boy\u0027s body, it works a wonderful change in him. His chest deepens, his shoulders broaden, his voice changes, his ideals are changed and enlarged. It gives him the capacity for deep feeling, for rich emotion. Pity the boy, therefore, who has wrong ideas of this important function, because they will lower his ideals of life. These organs actually secrete into the blood material that makes a boy manly, strong, and noble. Any habit which a boy has that causes this fluid to be discharged from the body tends to weaken his strength, to make him less able to resist disease, and often unfortunately fastens upon him habits which later in life he {233} cannot break. Even several years before this fluid appears in the body such habits are harmful to a growing boy.\nTo become strong, therefore, one must be pure in thought and clean in habit. This power which I have spoken of must be conserved, because this sex function is so deep and strong that there will come times when temptation to wrong habits will be very powerful. But remember that to yield means to sacrifice strength and power and manliness.\nFor boys who desire to know more of this subject we would suggest a splendid book by Dr. Winfield S. Hall, entitled, \u0022From Youth into Manhood.\u0022 Every boy in his teens who wants to know the secret of strength, power, and endurance should read this book.\nAnd if you want to read the whole thing (it\u0027s really fascinating, actually): \nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/29558/29558-h/29558-h.htm \n\nAnd to learn more about the Portuguese Man O\u0027 War:\nhttps://animalia.bio/portuguese-man-o-war",

If you must attend a protest, please protest for the rights of Scientologists rather than against their belief in Scientology.

When he attended a Large Group Awareness Training (LGAT) in 2010, he was surprised to find that the \u0027transformations\u0027 promised from this intense experience lined up with the symptoms of hypomania - the euphoric state that precedes full-blown mania in bipolar disorder. John completed his PhD with a dissertation on the role of dopamine in bipolar disorder/manic depression and the cogent idea that the dopamine system is sometimes hijacked to induce peak experiences. A fascinating new hypothesis that enhances our understanding of the irrational world of cultic involvement. ---------------- Links: John\u2019s doctoral dissertation  more on the Bear-Fedio index  religious figures and mania  the aberree online   ---------- More fascinating material from John Hunter:  his journal article on the dopaminergic defense hypothesis  A short article on LGATs published by the Psychological Society of South Africa  His illustrated essay on LGATs and Fight Club  -----------  Note (from Spike): The Temptation of St. Anthony by Hieronymus Bosch is one of my favorite paintings ever and the screencap here just doesn\u0027t do it justice.

      "description": "John Andrew Collins grew up in the royal family of the William Branham Message movement. His grandfather was the senior pastor at Branham\u0027s Tabernacle. John began to have doubts when he was 37 and started research that has continued for more than a decade. He is a prolific author who has revealed the intimate connection between some Pentecostalists - including Branham - with the Ku Klux Klan from its re-founding in 1915. He found links between Pentecostal Christianity and the Kardashian family; a Branham complex in Chile that smuggled Nazis into Argentina; the connection between Branham and Jim Jones who was responsible for the Jonestown killings; and even a connection to David \u0027Moses\u0027 Berg founder of the despicable child-molesting Children of God. A fascinating tour through one of the most influential groups in today\u0027s politicized religious right.  Spike\u0027s note: most of the pictures in this video were taken from John Collins\u0027 excellent website - it is truly amazing in the depth of information there, so check it out!!!!

      "description": "Anke Richter is one of the few journalists who has seriously researched authoritarian cults. Her own positive experience with a neo-tantra group helped her to understand the devastations caused by three very different cults: Centrepoint and Gloriavale in Aotearoa, New Zealand, and Agama Yoga in Thailand. Centrepoint was a free-love cult whose leaders were eventually imprisoned for sexual abuse and child sexual abuse. Gloriavale is a contemporary pseudo-Christian cult with bizarre sexual mores. Agama Yoga has been called the \u0027rape cult\u0027 and belongs to the neo-tantra movement - which promotes the notion of bliss or even enlightenment through sex. Anke gives readings from her well-researched and shocking book. A must-read that will become a classic.

In Mark\u0027s case, management was essentially telling him that the only reason he didn\u0027t want to not spend time with his family was that he had misunderstood some word in one of the relevant Scientology policies, NOT because they were going against their own policies and ignoring the established \u0022family time.\u0022",

His childhood left him angry and with no self-esteem. He has come to exemplify the thriving survivor. In 1995, he and his wife adopted two babies from Georgia. Ten years later, Kelvin realized that the children were the greatest gift he\u0027d ever received and wanted to give something back. The couple helped to turn around an orphanage in Georgia. Here Kelvin talks about their increasing commitment to children in Georgia through the Divine Child Foundation - not a religious organization, named with the idea that every child is divine.

      "description": "Harry Palmer transformed his Scientology Franchise into Avatar in the 1980s. Despite staff allegations of misconduct, he was able to create a worldwide movement with more members than the International Association of Scientologists. Ariela Sarai graduated from Columbia University in philosophy and religion and then spent six months working with Mother Theresa\u0027s outreach program before studying Tibetan Buddhism in the Dalai Lama\u0027s community. Returning to the US, she received a Master\u0027s in Social Work and was a practicing psychotherapist when therapist friends recruited her into Avatar; she was at the top of the organization by the time she left - after 21 years. Jon discusses the training methods - which borrow extensively from Scientology - the abuse within the group, and her departure and recovery from it. One of the most interesting chats on the channel!  Notes from Ariela:  -The Avatar courses were held in conference rooms in hotels with 200-4000 people from 50 countries attending. When we didn\u0027t have a student, we paid an internship fee of $650 plus hotel and airfare to teach the course. I was in the top inner circle, having daily contact with Harry Palmer\u0027s wife Avra Honey-Smith. I ran international teams, helping them recruit students and making sure they all had good results using the tools. I was on a course for 14-17 days per month.  -I am now a therapist with a full private practice, and I also work as a leadership coach at a Venture Capital firm. I am dedicated to helping people understand the tactics of manipulation and how to protect themselves and heal from this type of abuse. Although I don\u0027t actively seek to get people out of Avatar, I have helped many Avatars who reached out to me and needed help leaving and recovering.  -I am writing a memoir with my partner Mark to share our inner journey of this experience. I am also starting a Newsletter here.

      "description": "A review of the current court case in Los Angeles Criminal Courts where Danny Masterson is being tried for sexual assault. \u00A0\u00A0These are the TOP 5 points covered in this video: \u00A0\u00A0 1. Three women came forward to report the same incident to the Los Angeles Police Department: actor Danny Masterson had allegedly offered them a drink which made them semi-incapacitated, and then coerced them into physical relations.\u00A0 2. When one of these women reported the incident to a Scientology ethics officer she was told \u201CThere is no such thing as r*pe\u201D when you are in an intimate relationship. Another Ethics Officer told one of the women that she needed to supply physical intimacy to Danny on demand in EXCHANGE for living rent-free and having her meals paid for.\u00A0 3. Lisa Marie Presley, who was friendly with one of the women, was asked by Scientology staff to persuade her to NOT go to LAPD to report the assault. Lisa has subsequently apologized to the woman for doing this.\u00A0 4. Scientology (or any other cult) is ALWAYS the 3rd party, ever present in any intimate relationship and in Scn, anything voiced in counselling is carefully kept for blackmail, publication and control in the future.\u00A0 5. Jane Doe 4 was the fourth witness to Masterson\u2019s \u201Csignature\u201D of drugging before sexual assault. She had no \u201Cfish to fry\u201D \u2013 she wants no money from this case, only justice. \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Jon and Karen discuss details directly from court records. Journalist Tony Ortega has been faithfully transcribing the daily court prosecution and defense arguments at https://tonyortega.org for those who want to learn more. \u00A0\u00A0Note that Danny Masterson was in the Scientology for 40 years - this is an organization that takes \u201Cpride\u201D in their HIGH ETHICS and HIGH technology.",

      "description": "Voltaire said that people who believe absurdities will commit atrocities. Traditionalism is the simplistic creation of a golden age to support ideas of tribalism and racial purity. It has taken hold of populist movements and generated a new and ill-informed rightist upsurge. In the US, it is represented by Steve Bannon - who put Trump in the White House and was his first Chief of Staff; in Russia, by Alexander Dugin who preaches the re-unification of the Russian empire; and in Brazil by Olavo de Carvalho - Bolsanaro\u0027s guru. These pundits follow the teachings of Mussolini\u0027s advisor Julius Evola. They claim spiritual insight, but are ignorant of the subtle and complex ideas of true mysticism, instead grabbing beliefs in human decline - the End Days or Kali Yuga - as if they were prophetic truth, rather than bronze age anxieties. Mark and Jon show how traditions are often inventions to create tribalist separation between people. They offer some solutions to move us towards a pro-social, pro-human democracy that is neither left nor right wing.",

You\u2019re tied up into signing away your life with bunches of contracts, so you can never sue them when it all goes wrong.  The SCN cult reeks with malfeasance and corrupt activities - explained with examples in this video.\n\nbookmarks:\n\n0:45 John explains his black eye (a fall).\n1:26 SCN cult of HARD SELLING. Hubbard says: \u0022it\u2019s a \u0022MUST\u0022.\n5:00 Outing \u0022tag team\u0022 techniques.\n8:00 Threatening Clears that they are now at risk if they don\u0027t pay $40,000 immediately for their next levels (exorcism) is written in policy.\n10:45 Scientology, Inc is sitting with $3 billion in cash, but will extort every last dime without revealing they are Billionaires with ~ $4 billion stashed away.\n13:00 Scientology does not merely punish its staff; it humiliates and degrades the person to make them into a dot, while pretending they are taking people higher spiritually.\n18:15 Hubbard sent advice for John Axle to be spat on. Spitting became a thing to do in the SCN culture.  Seniors spat on juniors as a matter of course.\n22:10 the Mission Holder\u0027s conference catastrophe.  \n23.00 A new punishment Miscavige invented was that the targeted person had to lick the bathroom floor to white-glove standards with tongue.\n24.49 SCN cult craves ecclesiastical recognition and wants a CUT of your earnings - just like the mafia.\n28.00. Barbara\u0027s story. While the dead body of her husband was still in the morgue, four Sea Org members descended on her. They took everything, his pension, his life insurance, a mortgage on the home - they got it all and left at 4am with a million dollars.\n31:00 Sea Org member who was in for 40 years was thrown out when she could no longer work; she was descended on to do Super Power by a Sea Org gang and was told she would get re-implanted at death if she did not fork over 35,000 pounds.  She was forced to rebuy all the old books which got re-done; all her future pension was used up by this money extortion.\n34:00 Jon Atack\u0027s mom was also descended on by a gang for money extortion.\n37:00 It is standard practice to make completions re-do and recycle services they have already taken.  OT 8s are sent to re-do the entry program called Purification Rundown which is especially for heavy drug cases.\n39:00 Scn always makes you pay for counseling errors previously done. They admit to errors in their own tech. No such things as REFUNDS!\n41:00 So many were asking for money back that they opened a Refund Task Force.  The con is a loop around: you can\u0027t get your money back \u2018til you do the Claims Verification Board form, but you can\u0027t do the CVB form because you are declared a suppressive person.  \n43:00 Jon discusses shenanigans of the cult to the IRS.\n45:05 Two ex cops were hired by the cult to spy and surveil ex-SO member Pat Broeker for 24 years at the cost of MILLIONS of tax free money (501C 3), supposedly to be used for RELIGIOUS purposes.\n47:00 Scn cult makes hate sites calling long term ex-members criminal whereas they are the ULTIMATE criminal, whose intent is to HARM in any way they can, so long as they get your cash.\n51:00 the reason the San Luis Obispo coroner could identify the dead body as Hubbard\u0027s is because his fingerprints were on file for a previous arrest.\n54:00 A gang of four will arrive late at night and wear you down till they walk away with all you have in the bank plus future earnings: now you are in debt.  It\u2019s all about the cash.  Will that be Visa?  Master Card?  Amex?

First, we tackle \u201CThe General\u201D, where the Village is subjected to a sinister \u201Cspeed-learn\u201D program. Next, we look at \u201CLiving in Harmony\u201D, where number six finds himself in a village in the old American West, forced to act as sheriff for a judge who controls the whole town with an iron fist. We meander through our usual tangents, Spike waxes poetic about her love for Portmerion, Wales (the real-life village where the series was filmed), Monia wins all the Internets Points, and we have a lot of fun. \n\nlinks:\n\n\u201Ccorrect\u201D watching order for the series: https://www.hometheaterforum.com/community/threads/what-is-the-best-correct-order-to-watch-the-prisoner.38844/\n\nPortmerion\u2019s official site: https://portmeirion.wales\n\nkilling a computer with a question: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb\n\nplot synopses \u2013\nthe general: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_General_(The_Prisoner)#Plot_summary\nliving in harmony: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_in_Harmony_(The_Prisoner)#Plot_summary\n\nDr. Michele Haslam\u2019s website: https://newkadampatraditionreport.org\n\nthe \u201Cmaking of\u201D documentary: https://youtu.be/k0e4CBA5S0w\n\u201CThe Prisoner Puzzle\u201D 1979 interview: https://youtu.be/95DrM4tfyD0 \n\nnotes:\nFootage from various episodes including (but not limited to): The General, Living in Harmony, Arrival, Once Upon a Time, Fallout, A B or C, Free for All, and Schizoid Man are used under fair use (critique, discussion and review).\n\nThe \u201Cvillage\u201D font, created specifically on the show, may be downloaded from various online font sharing sites.",

      "description": "NOTE: in order to fix a glitch, we had to re-upload this video. Our apologies for the inconvenience.\n\nA riot of mirth and logic. In March 2021, Jon gave three interviews to Andy Nolch, who claimed to have abandoned Scientology after looking at Jon\u2019s material. After the last interview, Jon found that Andy had been in prison so interviewed him about his convictions, his anti-feminism, his use of the hallucinogen ayahuasca, his Holocaust denial and his right-wing views. Andy put all of these videos on his Independent Scientology Podcast. A few months later, without contacting Jon, he put up \u201CJon Atack debunked\u201D (and accused Jon of being \u201Cpassive-aggressive\u201D!). \n\nAlthough the video is an hour and twenty minutes, Andy only mentions three concerns about Jon\u2019s work (all three are taken up in this video). However, Andy does provide a remarkable demonstration of the beliefs that come from \u2018weak\u2019 and \u2018circumstantial\u2019 evidence (Andy\u2019s own terms). Unless you agree with Andy\u2019s veneration of Trump and Putin, his disbelief in vaccines and global warning and his belief that Dan Brown\u2019s Da Vinci Code is history not fiction, then your views simply cannot be trusted. Jon and Sam comment on the tortuous construction of belief so often found among conspiracy theorists (Andy identifies as such). \n\nAndy Nolch now calls himself a \u201Chalf-Scientologist\u201D and says that Jon should have been able to persuade him otherwise. However, in his approach to Jon, Andy wrote:\n\u201CI love your stuff. I love the deep investigation and information. I was a Scientologists [sic] inside and outside the church for around 4 years each. Now I am a non believer. You helped wake me up to the truth about Scientology along with Hubbards [sic] contradictions \u2026 Would Jon like to be my very last interview?\u201D\n\nfor the original interviews:\npart one: https://youtu.be/mqFMtmiKNuU\npart two: https://youtu.be/U-I-xh0156Y\npart three: https://youtu.be/C5Fe-xQUloQ\n\nJon interviews Andy: https://youtu.be/SQ671RiXANE\n\nThis is a response to Andy Nolch\u2019s \u201Cdebunking\u201D of Jon.

O\u2019Brien was the head of the Hubbard Association of Scientologists and arranged the Philadelphia \u2018Doctorate\u2019 Course in 1952. Hubbard wrote his infamous letter about adopting the \u2018religion angle\u2019 to her (she shared these letters with Jon and was one of 150 people who contributed to his research). Jon explains some of his own involvement \u2013 including taking the \u2018upper levels\u2019, auditor training and the Data Series Evaluator Course. Jon explains that contrary to popular belief his work has been to help Scientologists, so he is not an \u2018anti-Scientologist\u2019.

Jon reminds all of us that, as Tom Stoppard once observed, \u201Cyou can persuade a man to believe almost anything \u2013 provided he\u2019s clever enough.\u201D Chris and Jon discuss how intelligent, empathetic people were drawn into the web of Hubbard\u0027s nonsensical system, using all their imagination and intellect to make sense of the chaos, convincing themselves of meaning where none had existed before. As Jon rightly puts it, \u0022What is the lie in Scientology that makes it persist? that it works.\u0022\n\n___________________\n\nTo buy your own copy of Jon\u0027s classic book, Let\u0027s Sell These People a Piece of Blue Sky: https://www.amazon.com/Lets-sell-these-people-Piece-ebook/dp/B00BF385HG/ (now FREE with Kindle Unlimited!)\n\nTo buy a copy of Jon\u0027s Book, \u0022Opening Our Minds\u0022 on Kindle (print and audiobook coming soon!) https://www.amazon.com/Opening-Our-Minds-relationships-authoritarian-ebook/dp/B08YGTJW4P/\n\n---------------------------------\n\nCheck out our Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/jonatack \n\nor for a one-time donation, use our PayPal link!: https://www.paypal.me/jonatackandfriends \n\nfollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/atack_jon\nand Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/openmindstoday/ \n\nfor respectful, insightful, and engaging discussion on coercive control, manipulation, abusive groups and individuals, and more, join our facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/803202686721445/ (for faster acceptance to the group, please answer the \u201Cprove you\u2019re not a \u2018bot\u201D questions)",

No matter the subject, Hubbard claimed expertise \u2013 from racing cars on distant planets, to the nature of how light works. Hubbard passed on the certainty in his stories to his followers, aided by their belief in the e-meter: \u201Cif it reads on the e-meter, it must be true!\u201D Jon and Mike then move on to considering the myth of the \u201Creactive mind\u201D and how this belief is used to rope in followers, making them pay to exorcise their \u201Cdemons\u201D \u2013 demons created by master storyteller Hubbard. \n\nCheck out Mike Rinder\u0027s blog: https://www.mikerindersblog.org/tag/fair-game-podcast/\nAnd his \u0022Fair Game\u0022 podcast with Leah Remini: https://fairgamepodcast.com\n\nAnd to see the good work done by the Aftermath Foundation: http://theaftermathfoundation.org\n\nThe full Hubbard issue \u0022Keeping Scientology Working\u0022 :\nhttps://stss.nl/stss-materials/English/Courses%20Color%20Printing%20EN_CP_CR/EN_CP_CR_Keeping_Scientology_Working__KSW.pdf\n___________________________\nBear-Fedio index - characteristics of temporal epilepsy:\n\nhumorlessness\ndependence\ncircumstantiality\npersonal destiny\nobsessionalism\nviscosity\nemotionality\nguilt\nphilosophical interest\nanger\nreligiosity\nhypermoralism\nparanoia\nsadness\nhypergraphia\nelation\naggression\naltered sexuality\n-------------------------------\nThe full footage of the Getting Clear conference in Toronto 2015 may be rented here: \nhttps://vimeo.com/ondemand/gettingclear\n\nor see the our two favorite sessions for free here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOprfY0DnRsZ3rZ1a4TomFI8R_8uw_7Uu\n\nsee the interview with Barbara Klowden here: https://tonyortega.org/2015/01/24/first-time-in-full-1997-interview-of-barbara-klowden-l-ron-hubbards-pr-agent-and-lover/\n\nread Jon\u0027s paper, \u0022never believe a hypnotist\u0022, here: http://home.snafu.de/tilman/j/hypnosis.html\n\n___________________\n\nTo buy your own copy of Jon\u0027s classic book, Let\u0027s Sell These People a Piece of Blue Sky: https://www.amazon.com/Lets-sell-these-people-Piece-ebook/dp/B00BF385HG/ (now FREE with Kindle Unlimited!)\n\nTo buy a copy of Jon\u0027s Book, \u0022Opening Our Minds\u0022 on Kindle (print and audiobook coming soon!) https://www.amazon.com/Opening-Our-Minds-relationships-authoritarian-ebook/dp/B08YGTJW4P/\n\n---------------------------------\n\nCheck out our Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/jonatack \n\nor for a one-time donation, use our PayPal link!: https://www.paypal.me/jonatackandfriends \n\nfollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/atack_jon\nand Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/openmindstoday/ \n\nfor respectful, insightful, and engaging discussion on coercive control, manipulation, abusive groups and individuals, and more, join our facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/803202686721445/ (for faster acceptance to the group, please answer the \u201Cprove you\u2019re not a \u2018bot\u201D questions)",

      "description": "Ron Hubbard probably got the idea of the anti-social personality from Hervey Cleckley. Ed and Jon talk about the original list, Robert Hare\u0027s update, Hubbard\u0027s points and Jon\u0027s model of the human predator.\n\nCleckley\u0027s checklist: 1. Considerable superficial charm and average or above average intelligence.\n2. Absence of delusions and other signs of irrational thinking.\n3. Absence of anxiety or other \u201Cneurotic\u201D symptoms. Considerable poise, calmness and verbal facility.\n4. Unreliability, disregard for obligations, no sense of responsibility, in matters of little and great import.\n5. Untruthfulness and insincerity.\n6. Antisocial behavior which is inadequately motivated and poorly planned, seeming to stem from an inexplicable impulsiveness.\n7. Inadequately motivated antisocial behavior.\n8. Poor judgment and failure to learn from experience.\n9. Pathological egocentricity. Total self-centeredness and an incapacity for real love and attachment.\n10. General poverty of deep and lasting emotions.\n11. Lack of any true insight; inability to see oneself as others do.\n12. Ingratitude for any special considerations, kindness and trust.\n13. Fantastic and objectionable behavior, after drinking and sometimes even when not drinking. Vulgarity, rudeness, quick mood shifts, pranks for facile entertainment.\n14. No history of genuine suicide attempts.\n15. An impersonal, trivial, and poorly integrated sex life.\n16. Failure to have a life plan and to live in any ordered way  (unless it is for destructive purposes or a sham).   \n\nJon\u0027s human predator model: \n\u2022 Human predators are mean.\n\u2022 Predators are utterly selfish. \n\u2022 Predators pretend friendship and love but they feel absolutely nothing for others. \n\u2022 Predators are charming and good at flattery, but they don\u2019t mean a single word of it. \n\u2022 Predators brag and boast and make up outrageous lies. When challenged, they blame others. \n\u2022 Predators don\u2019t feel anxiety or fear or are deeply anxious and cowardly.\n\u2022 Predators are impulsive and easily bored. They demand thrills and take dangerous risks. They enjoy pushing others into taking dangerous risks, too.\n\u2022 Predators are bullies with explosive tempers. \n\u2022 Predators enjoy humiliating people. \n\u2022 Predators hate it if anyone else has power or is praised. For the predator, life is a competition and they want to win.\n\u2022 Predators weaken people with insults and putdowns.\n\u2022 Predators are cunning and manipulative. \n\u2022 Predators lie easily and think nothing of breaking a promise.\n\u2022 Predators are without conscience: they do not feel remorse or guilt.\n\u2022 Predators often boast about the harm they\u2019ve done to other people.\n\u2022 Predators are parasites. They are lazy and live off others, giving as little as possible in return.\n\u2022 Predators are control freaks, stopping others from taking control of anything if they can\n\u2022 Predators force petty rules on others \u2013 rules that are impossible to follow.\n\u2022 Predators boast about tricking other people.\n\u2022 Predators boast about breaking the law.\n\n\n\nAnd on a lighter note - \u0022wearing a loud shirt in a built-up area\u0022 \nhttps://youtu.be/BO8EpfyCG2Y\n\n___________________\n\nTo buy your own copy of Jon\u0027s classic book, Let\u0027s Sell These People a Piece of Blue Sky: https://www.amazon.com/Lets-sell-these-people-Piece-ebook/dp/B00BF385HG/ (now FREE with Kindle Unlimited!)\n\nTo buy a copy of Jon\u0027s Book, \u0022Opening Minds\u0022: https://www.amazon.com/opening-minds-manipulation-influence-brainwashing-ebook/dp/B01LYWEPJV/\n\n---------------------------------\n\nCheck out our Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/jonatack \n\nor for a one-time donation, use our PayPal link!: https://www.paypal.me/jonatackandfriends \n\nfollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/atack_jon\nand Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/openmindstoday/ \n\nfor respectful, insightful, and engaging discussion on coercive control, manipulation, abusive groups and individuals, and more, join our facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/803202686721445/ (for faster acceptance to the group, please answer the \u201Cprove you\u2019re not a \u2018bot\u201D questions)",

      "description": "Coercive (or authoritarian) groups and relationships are everywhere: from domestic abuse and pedophile grooming, to human trafficking and terrorist radicalization, millions of people worldwide are trapped in a web of undue influence, forced to act against their own best interests. These processes of manipulation are designed to be invisible to outsiders, and so those not inside the circle of influence grasp to try and find other explanations for the bizarre behavior they can see. Because of this, a mass of destructive, unhelpful misconceptions has arisen in the public mind, myths about coercive control that need to be debunked. Here are a few of the worst.\n\nTo see Spike\u0027s art, thoughts, and various ramblings, check out her blog here: https://phoenyxrose.wordpress.com\n\nTo hear Spike sing (including her original music), go to her YouTube channel, here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9JWCbFLEsjFzqTI4M4rCwQ\n----------------------------------\n\nTo buy your own copy of Jon\u0027s classic book, Let\u0027s Sell These People a Piece of Blue Sky: https://www.amazon.com/Lets-sell-these-people-Piece-ebook/dp/B00BF385HG/ (now FREE with Kindle Unlimited!)\n\nTo buy a copy of Jon\u0027s Book, \u0022Opening Minds\u0022: https://www.amazon.com/opening-minds-manipulation-influence-brainwashing-ebook/dp/B01LYWEPJV/\n\n---------------------------------\n\nCheck out our Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/jonatack \n\nor for a one-time donation, use our PayPal link!: https://www.paypal.me/jonatackandfriends \n\nfollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/atack_jon\nand Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/openmindstoday/ \n\nfor respectful, insightful, and engaging discussion on coercive control, manipulation, abusive groups and individuals, and more, join our facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/803202686721445/ (for faster acceptance to the group, please answer the \u201Cprove you\u2019re not a \u2018bot\u201D questions)",

      "description": "An astonishing series of revelations about Scientology\u0027s abuse of its members. Mike Rinder describes his arrival on Scientology\u0027s flagship the \u00A0Apollo at the tender age of 18. Sent from Australia for management training, after handing over his passport, he found he\u0027d been traded in a \u00A0typical case of Scientology\u0027s human trafficking. Conditions for the \u0022elite\u0022 Sea Org under Hubbard\u0027s direct control were deplorable. As Mike says, the former cattle hold which had become the men\u0027s dorm was like \u0022the black hole of Calcutta\u0022 and the food was \u0022garbage\u0022. Mike was tasked with \u0022baby-watching\u0022 the first victim of the Introspection Rundown (on which Lisa McPherson later died), which Hubbard claimed would cure insanity. Mike was also the only Scientologist left on the island of \u00A0Madeira after the notorious \u0022rock festival\u0022, where locals hurled bricks \u00A0and cobblestones at the Apollo, and was lucky to escape with his life. links: ex-Scientology kids: http://exscientologykids.com the Aftermath Foundation: http://theaftermathfoundation.org",

      "description": "An astonishing series of revelations about Scientology\u0027s abuse of its members. Mike Rinder describes his arrival on Scientology\u0027s flagship the Apollo at the tender age of 18. Sent from Australia for management training, after handing over his passport, he found he\u0027d been traded in a typical case of Scientology\u0027s human trafficking. Conditions for the \u0022elite\u0022 Sea Org under Hubbard\u0027s direct control were deplorable. As Mike says, the former cattle hold which had become the men\u0027s dorm was like \u0022the black hole of Calcutta\u0022 and the food was \u0022garbage\u0022. Mike was tasked with \u0022baby-watching\u0022 the first victim of the Introspection Rundown (on which Lisa McPherson later died), which Hubbard claimed would cure insanity. Mike was also the only Scientologist left on the island of Madeira after the notorious \u0022rock festival\u0022, where locals hurled bricks and cobblestones at the Apollo, and was lucky to escape with his life.\n\nlinks:\nex-Scientology kids: http://exscientologykids.com\nthe Aftermath Foundation: http://theaftermathfoundation.org\n\n------------------------------------\n\nTo buy your own copy of Jon\u0027s classic book, Let\u0027s Sell These People a Piece of Blue Sky: https://www.amazon.com/Lets-sell-these-people-Piece-ebook/dp/B00BF385HG/ (now FREE with Kindle Unlimited!)\n\nTo buy a copy of Jon\u0027s Book, \u0022Opening Minds\u0022: https://www.amazon.com/opening-minds-manipulation-influence-brainwashing-ebook/dp/B01LYWEPJV/\n\n---------------------------------\n\nCheck out our Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/jonatack \n\nor for a one-time donation, use our PayPal link!: https://www.paypal.me/jonatackandfriends \n\nfollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/atack_jon\nand Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/openmindstoday/ \n\nfor respectful, insightful, and engaging discussion on coercive control, manipulation, abusive groups and individuals, and more, join our facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/803202686721445/ (for faster acceptance to the group, please answer the \u201Cprove you\u2019re not a \u2018bot\u201D questions)",

In this stunning interview he describes the \u00A0fanatical determination to utterly ruin anyone who questions Hubbard\u0027s \u00A0work as a \u0027Supppressive Person\u0027, an \u0027enemy\u0027 of humanity. That included \u00A0Jon, when they last spoke in the mid-90s. Mike shows the secret Hubbard \u00A0documents that direct the harassment of \u0027Suppressives\u0027 and describes in \u00A0chilling detail the activities of the Office of Special Affairs which is \u00A0now trying to silence him with a typical smear campaign. In the 80s and \u00A090s there were only a handful of persistent critics, but now thousands \u00A0are speaking out, so Scientology no longer has the resources to harass \u00A0any but its most vocal critics. These include Mike Rinder who has become \u00A0Scientology\u0027s most dangerous former insider. \u00A0\u00A0 We urge you to join the #IGotOut campaign! \u00A0\u00A0 for Chris Owens\u0027 research and papers on Scientology: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/ \u00A0for Jon\u0027s paper, \u0022Scientology: religion or intelligence agency?\u0022: http://home.snafu.de/tilman/j/berlin.html?fbclid=IwAR3G8FA_m_jpw1sqwJLRTPtqlT8vTONCYInPmOlZ5yDPQVsNQeY8aNRAMto \u00A0 Mike Rinder\u0027s blogpost on Scientology\u0027s harassment procedures: https://www.mikerindersblog.org/dealing-with-critics-of-scientology-the-l-ron-hubbard-playbook/ \u00A0 for the documentary, \u0022the Shrinking World of L.

      "description": "Joe Kelly spent nine years in Transcendental Meditation and then five \u00A0more with a rival swami, who convinced his former TM followers to sue \u00A0for refunds from that group. This led to Joe meeting Margaret Singer, \u00A0who helped to begin to rethink his involvement. For many years, Joe has \u00A0worked helping members of authoritarian groups to rethink their \u00A0involvement. \u00A0 note: the former Cult Awareness Network was shut down as a result of a \u00A0Scientology lawsuit, and then sold to that group as part of the \u00A0resulting settlement. Today those who contact CAN via its website or \u00A0phone number are connected to a Scientology front group.

      "description": "Chris Shelton quizzes Jon about Erich Fromm\u2019s views on authoritarianism, freedom, narcissism, and the development of an independent self as the aim of life. Erich Fromm escaped Germany in 1933 when Hitler took power. He was a social psychologist and counsellor who wrote a series of best-selling books. Chris and Jon discuss this passage from Fromm\u2019s \u0022Man For Himself\u0022:\n\nThe duty of recognizing the authority\u2019s superiority results in several prohibitions. The most comprehensive of these is the tabu against feeling oneself to be, or ever able to become, like the authority, for this would contradict the latter\u2019s unqualified superiority and uniqueness. The real sin of Adam and Eve is, as has been pointed out before, the attempt to become like \nGod; and it is as punishment for this challenge and simultaneously as a deterrence of a repetition of it that they are expelled from the Garden of Eden. In authoritarian systems the authority is made out to be fundamentally different from his subjects. He has powers not attainable by anyone else: magic, wisdom, strength which can never by matched by his subjects. Whatever the authority\u2019s prerogatives are, whether he is the master of the universe or a unique leader sent by fate, the fundamental inequality between him and man is the basic tenet of authoritarian conscience. One particularly important aspect of the uniqueness of the authority is the privilege of being the only one who does not follow another\u2019s will, but who himself wills; who is not a means but an end in himself; who creates and is not created. In the authoritarian orientation, the power of will and creation are the privilege of the authority. Those subject to him are means to his end, and, consequently, his property and used by him for his own purposes. The supremacy of the authority is questioned by the attempt of the creature to cease being a *thing* and to become a creator.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\ntake the Levenson index: https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/LSRP.php \n\nvisit the V-Taiwan project page: https://info.vtaiwan.tw\n------------------------------------------\n\nTo buy your own copy of Jon\u0027s classic book, Let\u0027s Sell These People a Piece of Blue Sky: https://www.amazon.com/Lets-sell-these-people-Piece-ebook/dp/B00BF385HG/ (now FREE with Kindle Unlimited!)\n\nTo buy a copy of Jon\u0027s Book, \u0022Opening Minds\u0022: https://www.amazon.com/opening-minds-manipulation-influence-brainwashing-ebook/dp/B01LYWEPJV/\n\n---------------------------------\n\nCheck out our Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/jonatack \n\nor for a one-time donation, use our PayPal link!: https://www.paypal.me/jonatackandfriends \n\nfollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/atack_jon\nand Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/openmindstoday/ \n\nfor respectful, insightful, and engaging discussion on coercive control, manipulation, abusive groups and individuals, and more, join our facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/803202686721445/ (for faster acceptance to the group, please answer the \u201Cprove you\u2019re not a \u2018bot\u201D questions)",

In the present climate of racial tension, bigotry and ingrained injustice, we need to address the tribalism, misplaced loyalty, and persecution of whistleblowers in the law enforcement system. We should reward the good, name and shame the bad, and move forward into a more equitable state of justice for all.\n \nIn that spirit, we suggest the hashtag #copsintegritymatters - to encourage people to hold the police of all countries to account, and create a world where the justice system works for the people, and not against us. We also advocate more public acknowledgement of the difficult and challenging work that many police officers do, and suggest that good police departments show the bad ones how to support the law rather than their law-breaking associates.",

A history of subjection to totalitarian control over a prolonged period (months to years). Examples include hostages, prisoners of war, concentration camp survivors, and survivors of some religious cults. [Authors\u2019 note: We would remove the word \u0027religious\u0027 so as to include all systems of thought reform.] Examples also include those subjected to totalitarian systems in sexual and domestic life, including survivors of domestic battering, childhood physical or sexual abuse, and organized sexual exploitation.\n \n2. Alterations in affect regulation, including\n\u00B7      persistent dysphoria\n\u00B7      chronic suicidal preoccupation\n\u00B7      self-injury\n\u00B7      explosive or extremely inhibited anger (may alternate)\n\u00B7      compulsive or extremely inhibited sexuality (may alternate)\n \n3. Alterations in consciousness, including\n\u00B7      amnesia or hypermnesia for traumatic events\n\u00B7      transient dissociative episodes\n\u00B7      depersonalization/derealization\n\u00B7      reliving experiences, either in the form of intrusive post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms or in the form of ruminative preoccupation\n \n4. Alteration in self-perception, including\n\u00B7      sense of helplessness or paralysis of initiative\n\u00B7      shame, guilt, and self-blame\n\u00B7      sense of defilement or stigma\n\u00B7      sense of complete difference from others (may include a sense of specialness, utter aloneness, belief no other person can understand, or nonhuman identity)\n \n5. Alterations in perception of perpetrator, including\n\u00B7      preoccupation with relationship with perpetrator (includes preoccupation with revenge)\n\u00B7      unrealistic attribution of total power to perpetrator (caution: victim\u2019s assessment of power realities may be more realistic than clinician\u2019s)\n\u00B7      idealization or paradoxical gratitude\n\u00B7      sense of special or supernatural relationship\n\u00B7      acceptance of belief system or rationalizations of perpetrator\n \n6. Alterations in relations with others, including\n\u00B7      isolation and withdrawal\n\u00B7      disruption of intimate relationships\n\u00B7      repeated search for rescuer (may alternate with isolation and withdrawal)\n\u00B7      persistent distrust\n\u00B7      repeated failures of self-protection\n \n7. Alterations in systems of meaning\n\u00B7      loss of sustaining faith\n\u00B7      sense of hopelessness and despair\n\n--------------------------\nTo buy your own copy of Jon\u0027s classic book, Let\u0027s Sell These People a Piece of Blue Sky: https://www.amazon.com/Lets-sell-these-people-Piece-ebook/dp/B00BF385HG/ (now FREE with Kindle Unlimited!)\n\nTo buy Chris\u0027 book, A to Xenu - an insider\u0027s guide to Scientology: https://www.amazon.com/Scientology-Insiders-Guide-Really-About-ebook/dp/B019S20FLO/\n\nAnd check out Chris\u0027 Channel here: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF326xyA0QHI7Z5xAwKQDJg\nChris\u0027 website: https://mncriticalthinking.com\n\nFor more information on Scientology, see\nTony Ortega\u0027s Underground Bunker - https://tonyortega.org\nOperation Clambake: http://www.xenu.net\nLermanet: http://www.lermanet.org\n\n------------------------------------------------ \nCheck out our Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/jonatack \n\nor for a one-time donation, use our PayPal link!: https://www.paypal.me/jonatackandfriends \n\nfollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/minds_opening \nand Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/openmindstoday/ \n\nfor respectful, insightful, and engaging discussion on coercive control, manipulation, abusive groups and individuals, and more, join our facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/803202686721445/ (for faster acceptance to the group, please answer the \u201Cprove you\u2019re not a \u2018bot\u201D questions)",

She had directed Scientology Apple Schools and been Director of Processing at the American Saint Hill Organization. Bonnie and her husband Richard worked closely with Jon in the early 1990s before setting up Escape to help former members. \n\nBonnie and Richard endured seven years of litigation for handing out the leaflet \u201CWhat the Scientologists don\u2019t tell you\u201D. For a revised version, see this link: https://www.facebook.com/notes/jon-atack/what-the-scientologists-dont-tell-you-a-pamphlet-by-bonnie-woods/904278513351578/\n\nThis leaflet proved effective in closing down both the East Grinstead Dianetic Book Shop and the Chichester Scientology Mission, when street recruiters were tagged by local Christians who handed the leaflet to everyone approached by the recruiter. Eventually, the Scientologists withdrew their case, apologized in in the London High Court, paid \u00A355,000 in damages, the costs of the action and made an undertaking that Richard and Bonnie can say whatever they like based upon the voluminous documents used in court discovery.\n \nlink: http://www.escapeint.org/legal/apology.htm\n\n__________________________________________________________\nlinks to books mentioned in the video:\nBare-Faced Messiah - https://www.amazon.com/Bare-Faced-Messiah-True-Story-Hubbard-ebook/dp/B07H182V4G/\n\nDeceived: One Woman\u0027s Stand Against the Church of Scientology - https://www.amazon.com/Deceived-Womans-against-Church-Scientology/dp/1903905214/\n\nDianetics in Limbo - http://www.xenu.net/archive/books/dil/Dianetics_in_Limbo.txt\n\nThe Mind Benders: https://www.amazon.com/Mind-benders-Scientology-Cyril-Vosper/dp/0854350616/\n\nTroublemaker: https://www.amazon.com/Troublemaker-Surviving-Hollywood-and-Scientology/dp/B01604H1DI/\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nFor more information see: Jon Atack, Let\u0027s sell these people A Piece of Blue Sky; Jenna Miscavige-Hill, Beyond Belief; Marc Headley, Blown for Good; Margery Wakefield, The Road to Xenu; John Duignan, The Complex; Lawrence Wright, Going Clear; Bent Corydon with Brian Ambry, L.

The charismatic rock star propels Big into a cult group, where members believe themselves to be members of the lost Cherokee Kanasta tribe. Their new leader, former dominatrix Wasp Tongue, reclaims the magical Ulunsuti crystal, and sets about revenging the Cherokee on the White world.\n\nBig teams up with Peter, a brilliant fifteen-year-old musician who has grown up in the cult and longs to escape it. Big also falls head over heels in love with Beloved Woman, the daughter of the cult\u2019s recently demised founder, Wide Eye.\n\nBig tumbles through a series of dreams and visions, discovering strange facets of Jimi Hendrix\u2019s life, fragments of Cherokee lore, and bits of Blues legend. Ultimately, this journey leads to the resolution of his own retreat from life and relationships.\n\n___________________________________________",

Although the 1944 film with Ingrid Bergman and Charles Boyer is the best-known, I prefer the 1940 version with Diana Wynard and Anton Walbrook, simply because Walbrook is much better at being totally evil. However, the 1944 film is also worth a look, if only for Angela Lansbury\u0027s first film appearance at age 19 as Nancy, the parlormaid.
