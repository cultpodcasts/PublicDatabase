Giovannie is an actor, producer, director, writer, filmmaker, speaker, musician, and one of our favorite people! Giovannie Espiritu\u0027s identity is inherently political: A bisexual, once-undocumented immigrant Filipina mom who spent time in a Biblical doomsday cult as a teen. Her first short film, \u201CUltra-Feminist,\u201D got an Honorable Mention at Outfest:Fusion, and her second film, \u201CALLY 3000,\u201D won over 12 awards at film festivals mainly in scriptwriting and social justice. Most of her work has taken aim at dismantling the patriarchy, healing generational trauma, and exposing systems of bias with humor. Her IRL and reel life mantra is to \u201CBreak Hearts Wide Open and Create More Moments of Joy.\u201D In today\u2019s episode we get into the balance of sharing your experiences in story form, following your heart in day to day moments, and so so so much more.
