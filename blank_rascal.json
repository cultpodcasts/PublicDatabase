      "description": "This is my thirteenth video.\nToday, we are dunking on Scientology. Focusing on the life of L Ron Hubbard, aliens and other utterly mental stuff. It is really quite astonishing that Scientology has been so successful, given that it is based on absolute nonsense made up by a mentally ill science fiction writer. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the video.\nFor those of you begging for videos on other religions, such as Buddhism, Jainism, Judaism, Christianity and Islam - please have patience. All ideologies will be treated to equal levels of mockery in time. Be sure to subscribe so you don\u0027t miss your favourite.\nAs for the upload schedule, it has gone to shit.\nAll is lost.\nIf I am to complete the twelve promised videos of 2025, I must now make four videos in the next two months.\nConsidering that this video alone took me as much time, the odds of keeping my word are low.\nBut I really hate going back on my promises, so if any of you have a miracle up your arse that you could pull out and lend me, I would appreciate it.\n\nAs always, I extend my personal gratitude to my Patrons and channel members:\nFilip Tomic\nSleepJuice\nBruce Carpenter\nHari Kishore\nGary Hartwell Dinmore\nFreddy\n\nFeel free to join their illustrious rank:\npatreon.com/BlankRascal",
