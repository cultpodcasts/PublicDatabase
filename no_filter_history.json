      "description": "The Thuggee Cult was a notorious and secretive group of criminals and assassins that operated in India for centuries, primarily during the 13th to 19th centuries. They were known for their ritualistic killings, often strangling their victims with a cloth or garrote, a method they believed honoured the Hindu goddess Kali, whom they revered. The Thuggees would join travellers on the roads of India, gain their trust, and then kill them in elaborate ambushes before looting their possessions. Their activities were widespread and terrifying, with estimates of their killings ranging in the tens of thousands.\n\nThe British colonial authorities eventually launched a massive campaign to suppress the Thuggee cult in the early 19th century, led by British officer William Sleeman. This crackdown resulted in thousands of arrests and executions, effectively dismantling the cult. The Thuggees left behind a chilling legacy as one of the most infamous criminal organisations in Indian history.\n\nFollow us on Twitter: https://x.com/nofilterhistory\n\nVoice over: Christian Neale\n\nVideo by: Iyrna Syzonenko",
