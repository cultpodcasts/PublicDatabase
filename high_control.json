      "description": "In this episode, Ally and Scot discuss their experience of leaving cults. Scot shares about leaving the United Pentecostal Church (UPC), which he was born into. Ally\u0027s experience of leaving the UPC was more combative, as her entire church left due to disagreements with the organization\u0027s teachings. Ally and Scot share personal stories and offer advice for those who have experienced high-control groups. They also address the consequences of leaving, including being labeled as bitter and the loss of relationships. They emphasize the importance of recognizing unhealthy practices and questioning beliefs. They also discuss the appeal of charismatic leaders and the deceptive tactics they employ. The episode highlights the abusive history of Mike Bickle and the International House of Prayer (IHOPKC) as an example of how charismatic leaders can deceive their followers. The conversation concludes with a discussion on the cult-like nature of multi-site churches and the reduction of people to consumers in the cult of capitalism. Questions? Comments?
