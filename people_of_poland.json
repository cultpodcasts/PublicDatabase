      "title": "Inside the Cult That Controlled My Life: My Escape From The Family International",
      "description": "I was involved with The Family International, and in this video I\u2019m finally talking openly about what I experienced inside the group and why I eventually decided to leave. This is my honest account of the culture, expectations, pressure, and the moment everything clicked and I knew I had to walk away. We talk about how the group operated, what daily life felt like, the psychological and emotional impact, and what leaving meant for me afterward. My goal is simply to share my experience in a straightforward and truthful way and help others understand what high control groups can look like. If you have ever been part of anything strict, controlling, or manipulative, parts of this story may feel familiar.\n\n*****************************************************************************\nLinks:\nhttp://www.exfamily.org/index.htm\nhttps://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Main_Page\nhttps://www.youtube.com/shorts/zghBGwTOAPk\nhttps://www.youtube.com/shorts/ETvshr8EAhY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/shorts/NPELB0CtDns\n*****************************************************************************\n\n\n\u274C No Topic is Off-Limits \u274C\n\u2705 Politics \u0026 economics\n\u2705 Religion \u0026 culture\n\u2705 Conspiracy theories \uD83D\uDEF8\n\u2705 Ghost stories \uD83D\uDC7B\n\u2705 Life in Poland \uD83C\uDDF5\uD83C\uDDF1\n\u2705 And so much more!\n\nThis isn\u2019t about creating an echo chamber, I\u2019m here for honest conversations, different viewpoints, and real dialogue. \uD83C\uDFA4\n\n\uD83D\uDCA1 Want to be a guest?\nIf you have a unique perspective or story to share, I\u2019d love to talk to you!
