      "description": "\uD83C\uDFA5 In this video, I share my personal story of how I got involved in **The Family International** aka the children of god, a group widely regarded as a cult. What started as a search for purpose and belonging slowly turned into something much darker, spiritual control, emotional manipulation, and isolation from the outside world.\n\nThis is **Part 1** of a multi-part series where I break down:\n\u2022 How I was introduced to The Family  \n\u2022 The red flags I missed  \n\u2022 What life inside the group was like  \n\u2022 How they used religion as a tool for control\n\n\u26D4 This is NOT sensationalized.
