      "description": "Welcome to Witchy Goddess Reborn.\n\nThis is the first introductory episode in my new series: Escaping the Watchtower \u2013 My Life Inside and Outside Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.\n\nIn this video, I take you back to the beginning\u2014when I was just 14 years old and first recruited into the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in 1996. What started as a search for belonging and spiritual truth quickly became a slow descent into a high-control system that would shape\u2014and nearly break\u2014my entire life.\n\nI share how I was approached, what drew me in, and how I came to be baptized as a teenager, not realizing the long-term emotional, psychological, and spiritual toll it would take. This series is about truth, healing, and reclaiming your voice after religious trauma.\n\nWhether you\u2019re currently questioning, newly awakened, or healing from a high-control religion or cult, you\u2019re not alone. I see you. And I made this for you.\n\nThis series will explore:\n \u2022 Life inside the Jehovah\u2019s Witness world\n \u2022 Emotional and spiritual manipulation\n \u2022 The BITE model (how cults work)\n \u2022 My disassociation at age 37 in 2018\n \u2022 How I reclaimed my spiritual power and rebuilt my life\n\nIf this resonates, please like, comment, and subscribe. Your story matters, and together we can break the silence.\n\nFollow me on TikTok for shorter stories \u0026 updates:\n@witchygoddessreborn\n\n#JehovahsWitness #ExJW #ReligiousTrauma #SpiritualAbuse #CultAwareness #WitchyGoddessReborn #BITEModel #HighControlGroup #Deconstruction #HealingJourney #FormerJW #EscapingTheWatchtower",
