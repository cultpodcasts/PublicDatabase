      "description": "Grab a copy of After Purity by Sara Moslener: https://amzn.to/48MG7WY In After Purity, purity scholar Sara Moslener conducts a nuanced investigation of purity culture in white evangelical Christianity, revealing its profound impact on gender, sexuality, race, and national identity in the United States. Moslener shares exclusive stories of participants from her research on the After Purity Project to discuss how purity culture affected women\u2014particularly white women\u2014who grew up in the evangelical church. These stories depict how white supremacy has a hand in constructing idealized \u201Ctraditional\u201D or \u201Cbiblical\u201D views of family, white racial identity, sexuality, gender expression, and religion, and how our physical bodies are situated within systems of power and oppression. With a blend of history, current research, and sustained analysis, Moslener explores how white evangelicalism has become so politically powerful, why gender and sexuality are positioned at the center of debate, and how those debates aim to obscure deeper histories of white evangelical racism. She describes the full disturbing effect of the \u201CTrue Love Waits\u201D movement and how purity teachings displaced all other forms of religious education in evangelicalism. From her interviewees in the After Purity Project, she shares stories of oppressive personal piety, sexual repression, disembodiment, self-hatred, mandatory hetero-normativity, and the many layers of obligation and shame in sexuality before reaching adulthood and navigating their way out of the church. Moslener also describes her own story of being a teen advocate for purity culture to becoming a researcher, scholar, and advocate for people harmed by purity. After Purity provides a window into the world of white evangelicalism and how its leaders and political allies have manufactured socio-sexual panic to justify the elimination of sexual and religious diversity that thrive in a flourishing democracy. \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F Support the Show: Patreon.com/PreacherBoys \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F If you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F CONNECT WITH THE SHOW: preacherboyspodcast.com https://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc https://www.instagram.com/preacherboyspod https://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/ \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F The content presented in this video is for informational and educational purposes only.

      "description": "Popular psychotherapist Joe Nucci (@JoeNucciTherapy) shares truth and research as he discusses common mental health myths and replaces them with no-nonsense truths and accessible guidance for real healing.\n\nThe popularization of mental health content on social media has led to an epidemic of mental health misinformation. In\u00A0Psychobabble, licensed psychotherapist Joe Nucci argues that too many of us are self-diagnosing, improperly deploying therapy-speak, and even coaching others to engage in harmful activities under the guise of \u201Cself-care.\u201D\n\nNucci dismantles 40 popular misconceptions, such as:\n\n\u2013\u00A0Everyone needs to go to therapy.\n\n\u2013\u00A0Your feelings are credible.\n\n\u2013\u00A0People gaslight you when they disagree.\n\n\u2013\u00A0Mindfulness is good for everyone.\n\n\u2013\u00A0Everyone has trauma.\n\n\u2013\u00A0The reason you can\u2019t focus is ADHD.\n\nThis dangerous misinformation encourages well-meaning individuals to make consequential life decisions based on false beliefs, half-truths, and the advice of unlicensed armchair experts. It is time for a professional to call this out. Nucci replaces these myths with liberating truths that can help readers avoid misinformation, navigate important philosophical debates, and better maneuver their own mental health journeys. He shares client examples and evidence-based psychological theory, and draws from reputable studies and research.\n\nTikTok influencers and \u201Clife coaches\u201D create viral videos telling people to cut off their problematic parents, and are cheered on by millions of followers. Recent divorcees proudly declare on Instagram that they are finally healing from their \u201Cnarcissistic\u201D ex-partner, even though you get the sense they can\u2019t actually define that word. Teenage \u201Cmental health advocates\u201D lament the struggles of living with autism, but then subtly add that their condition is \u201Cself-diagnosed.\u201D It is time for a professional to call out the misinformation and absurdity.\n\nPsychobabble\u00A0is a must-read book for anyone who values mental health and cares about others.\n\nGrab a copy of Joe Nucci\u0027s book, PsychoBabble: Viral Mental Health Myths \u0026 the Truths to Set You Free here: https://amzn.to/47XEN2S\n\nSupport the Show: Patreon.com/PreacherBoys\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nIf you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nCONNECT WITH THE SHOW:\n\npreacherboyspodcast.com\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/preacherboyspod\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod\n\nTo connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nThe content presented in this video is for informational and educational purposes only.

      "description": "Daniella was born a third-generation member of the infamous Children of God religious cult, and grew up being trafficked around the world, before escaping that life and moving to America at age 15. She put herself through high school and graduated as college valedictorian before commissioning into the US Army as an intelligence officer. That\u2019s where she really started to think about group behavior\u2026and seeing it, well, everywhere.\nDaniella deployed twice to Afghanistan (2011, 2014) and became a member of one of the Army\u2019s first Female Engagement teams (an experiment that put women into deliberate ground combat for the first time in Army history, and eventually led to the repeal of the sexist combat ban and the gender desegregation of the entire US military).\nShe is a proud daughter of the 101st, (that\u0027s the unit in Band of Brothers), and a recipient of the Presidential Volunteer Service Award (from Obama, y\u0027all). She earned her Master of Arts in Organizational Psychology at the Harvard Extension School, where she focused her research on group behavior, social norms, culture, extremism, leadership, demagoguery and cults.\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nSupport the Show: Patreon.com/PreacherBoys\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nIf you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nCONNECT WITH THE SHOW:\npreacherboyspodcast.com\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys\nhttps://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\nhttps://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc\nhttps://www.instagram.com/preacherboyspod\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod\n\nTo connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\nThe content presented in this video is for informational and educational purposes only.

Raised in a deeply fundamentalist, far-right environment, Monte shares her powerful journey from loyal believer to outspoken critic\u2014revealing the systems of control, misogyny, and hypocrisy that shaped her worldview. In this conversation, we dive into the gender and generational divides tearing through the church, the radicalization of young men through manosphere ideologies, and the mass exodus of Gen Z women rejecting purity culture and patriarchal power. \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F If you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F CONNECT WITH THE SHOW: preacherboyspodcast.com https://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc https://www.instagram.com/preacherboyspod https://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/ \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F The content presented in this video is for informational and educational purposes only.

      "description": "Pick up a copy of Dr. Boedy\u0027s book: https://amzn.to/3JjnqQA Matthew Boedy was targeted by Turning Point USA in 2016 and listed on its \u201Cprofessor watchlist\u201D after speaking up against allowing concealed guns on college campuses. As one of the foremost experts on Turning Point USA and its founder and CEO Charlie Kirk, Boedy exposes their role in perpetuating Christian nationalism in the United States and the threat to democracy they pose. With a background in journalism, an MFA in creative writing, and a PhD in rhetoric, he is a dynamic and experienced scholar whose first book, Speaking of Evil, explored the evolving rhetoric surrounding evil. Boedy currently teaches rhetoric and composition courses at the University of North Georgia and lives in Gainesville, Georgia, with his wife and two daughters. About his book, The Seven Mountains Mandate: Exposing the Dangerous Plan to Christianize America and Destroy Democracy: \u201CA sobering assessment of the evolution of Christian nationalism.\u201D \u2013Publishers Weekly Exposing the decades-long plan to radically transform America, from Bill Bright and Loren Cunningham\u2019s 1975 \u201Cseven mountains\u201D vision to Charlie Kirk\u2019s 2020 praise of Donald Trump for embracing it, The Seven Mountains Mandate reveals how prosperity preachers and political operatives are destroying democracy under Trump\u2019s second administration. The movement to install a populist strongman in the White House with a game plan for enforcing right-wing policies and catering to evangelical Christians started well before Donald Trump\u2019s first candidacy. For decades, a well-funded network of religious and political operatives has been quietly working to dismantle democracy and replace it with Christian theocracy. Their strategy? The seven mountains mandate\u2014a plan to seize control of seven key pillars of American society and reshape the nation. Scholar Matthew Boedy exposes how this movement\u2014driven by prosperity preachers, extremist politicians, and right-wing power brokers\u2014laid the groundwork for Trump\u2019s presidency and is now advancing its agenda under his second administration. From local school board elections to billion-dollar megachurches, this multipronged effort is reshaping the country in ways most Americans don\u2019t even realize. Discover what has motivated the key players in this movement, how they\u2019ve operated, and what is the unprecedented role of millennial \u201Ckingmaker\u201D Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA and the new face of Christian nationalism and the seven mountains movement, who believes that \u201Cwe finally have a president who understands the seven mountains of cultural influence.\u201D Today\u2019s news is so much more than the scattershot orders of an extreme administration. With Project 2025 policies in motion, the seven mountains movement is closer than ever to its goal of turning America into a Christian nationalist state. Leaders of this movement have been playing a long game, undermining democracy to establish a theocracy, but it\u2019s not too late to halt their progress and reverse the tide. This book reveals what\u2019s happening behind the scenes\u2014and what you can do to stop it.

As some of the scandal came to light, several of the Duggar children, including Jill and Jinger, have opened up about what it was like growing up in that environment. But for the first time, Amy Duggar King--a close relative who spent almost every day with her 19 cousins and her aunt and uncle--brings the story into sharp relief, vulnerably sharing not only what life was like with the Duggars but how she, at the end of the day, had her own broken home to return to, a home that was hiding many other secrets. Amy knows what it\u0027s like to be coerced and have her voice silenced. Her story reveals a world of unrealistic expectations and gaslighting in which a normal young woman had to untangle a web of carefully crafted lies while fighting to protect her own mental health. In that world, she was branded \u0022Crazy Cousin Amy\u0022--an identity she didn\u0027t choose but was forced to live into. In Holy Disruptor, Amy gives her unfiltered testimony to finally break free from the toxic cycles that swirled around her and to confront the trauma she endured off-camera. In the years since the Duggar family collapse, Amy has intentionally dissociated from the toxic family environment, which has helped her learn how to be a \u0022holy disruptor\u0022 and make life-changing decisions for her well-being. This is a story about how she discovered that disrupting such deception is a holy act that brings freedom and joy . . . and it applies to you too. No matter what you\u0027ve been told or how you\u0027ve been manipulated in the past, freedom is waiting for you. It\u0027s time to use your voice and get loud with the truth. \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F CONNECT WITH THE SHOW: preacherboyspodcast.com https://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc https://www.instagram.com/preacherboyspod https://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/ \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F The content presented in this video is for informational and educational purposes only.

      "description": "In December 2020, Lindsey became the first woman to publicly accuse former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo of sexual harassment. Her courage set off a political firestorm, triggered a statewide investigation, and ultimately led to his resignation. But now, despite everything, Cuomo is back \u2014 running for mayor of New York City. Lindsey is sounding the alarm about what it means when powerful men are able to reinvent themselves without ever facing real accountability. In our conversation, Lindsey and I go beyond Cuomo. We talk about the Democratic establishment itself \u2014 about how figures like Joe Biden, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Kirsten Gillibrand, and others have navigated allegations of misconduct in their own ranks. We explore how party loyalty, for-profit media, and name recognition often take priority over justice, leaving survivors sidelined and even used as \u0022shields\u0022 for others. This is a story about how institutions protect their own and rationalize abuse when it threatens power \u2014 and what it takes to blow the whistle. \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F If you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F CONNECT WITH THE SHOW: preacherboyspodcast.com https://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc https://www.instagram.com/preacherboyspod https://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/ \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F The content presented in this video is for informational and educational purposes only.

In this thought-provoking interview, Brian Recker (former evangelical pastor \u0026 author of Hell Bent: How the Fear of Hell Holds Christians Back from a Spirituality of Love) shares his journey from Independent Fundamental Baptist (IFB) upbringing to progressive Christianity. Along the way, he unpacks how doctrines of eternal punishment warp faith, relationships, \u0026 even our definition of love. We explore: \u2013 Growing up under the constant fear of hell: altar calls, camp gimmicks, \u0026 conversion pressure. \u2013 How doctrines of punishment fuel church growth, finances, \u0026 community control. \u2013 Why questioning hell can cost pastors their jobs \u0026 reputations. \u2013 Alternate views like annihilationism \u0026 universalism\u2014and how they reshape faith. \u2013 How fear-centered theology distorts family bonds, community, \u0026 self-worth. \u2013 Brian\u0027s personal stories of divorce, deconstruction, \u0026 healing. \u2013 A vision of spirituality focused on love, justice, \u0026 liberation\u2014not fear \u0026 control. \uD83D\uDCD6 Grab Brian\u0027s book Hell Bent here: https://amzn.to/3VBCWdl (As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.

As someone who critiques religious fundamentalism, Christian nationalism, and the toxic politics of the religious right, I feel compelled to speak clearly: Charlie Kirk\u2019s death was wrong, but it does not make his beliefs right. In this video, I unpack the dangerous binary thinking surrounding his legacy, the way fundamentalist leaders are weaponizing his death, and why dehumanization\u2014whether from the left or right\u2014only fuels division.

The Myth of Good Christian Parenting exposes how the Christian parenting industry has sold families false promises for 5 decades, leaving a trail of religious trauma, damaged relationships, \u0026 lost faith in its wake. This groundbreaking analysis offers \u25CF historical analysis - traces the development of the Christian parenting industry \u0026 its influential figures who built parenting empires; \u25CF research-based insights - features survey data from adult children \u0026 parents affected by authoritarian parenting methods; \u25CF theological examination - analyzes how popular teachings on authority, compliance, corporal punishment, \u0026 control diverge from Jesus\u0027s teachings; \u0026 \u25CF encouragement for a better future - equips readers to pursue a new path of freedom \u0026 mutual respect within their families. Marissa Franks Burt \u0026 Kelsey Kramer McGinnis combine rigorous research with compelling storytelling to reveal how evangelical parenting culture has shaped--and often strained--families from the 1970s to today. Drawing on history, sociology, theology, \u0026 extensive survey responses from adult children \u0026 parents, they trace the rise of Christian parenting empires that idealize obedient children \u0026 perfect households while leaving real families feeling inadequate. They also examine the lasting damage caused by popular Christian parenting teachings--including loss of faith, estrangement, religious trauma, \u0026 deep regret for older parents--and provide hope for healing. Whether you\u0027re a Christian parent questioning traditional methods, an adult recovering from a strict religious upbringing, or a church leader seeking healthier family ministry approaches, this book equips you to pursue mutual respect, emotional safety, \u0026 authentic faith within your family relationships. \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F Support the Show: Patreon.com/PreacherBoys \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F If you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F CONNECT WITH THE SHOW: preacherboyspodcast.com https://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc https://www.instagram.com/preacherboyspod https://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/ \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F The content presented in this video is for informational \u0026 educational purposes only.

      "description": "A disturbing case exposed how the Mormon Church\u0027s 24/7 legal hotline advised bishops not to report child abuse, citing clergy-penitent privilege under Arizona law. Despite years of abuse, the father wasn\u0027t stopped until law enforcement discovered evidence online. After a judge initially shielded the church from lawsuits, an appeals court reversed the decision in 2025, highlighting loopholes in reporting laws. Most states, including Arizona, still allow clergy to withhold abuse reports, but some\u2014like TX, WA, \u0026 NC\u2014have eliminated these exemptions. Many urge closing these legal gaps to better protect children. \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F Watch my coverage of the ongoing fight to end clergy loopholes in Washington: https://youtu.be/ZLz2WOM7ND0?si=yXrNWIJ2Th-NqYsx \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F Support the Show: Patreon.com/PreacherBoys \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F If you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F CONNECT WITH THE SHOW: preacherboyspodcast.com https://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc https://www.instagram.com/preacherboyspod https://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/ \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F The content presented in this video is for informational \u0026 educational purposes only.

      "description": "In this episode of the Preacher Boys Podcast, host Eric Schwisinski sits down with Cara Meredith, author of Church Camp: Bad Skits, Cry Night, and How White Evangelicalism Betrayed a Generation. Together, they unpack the formative \u2013 and often fraught \u2013 world of evangelical church camps. Cara shares insights from her 30 years in camp ministry and her research, including interviews with dozens of former campers and staff across the U.S. The conversation explores the nostalgia and positive aspects of camp, as well as the darker threads: pressured conversions, purity culture, patriarchy, and the marginalization of women, LGBTQ individuals, and people of color. Cara and Eric discuss how church camp acts as a microcosm of white evangelicalism, often pushing conformity and suppressing individuality under the guise of faith formation. They also reflect on leadership, intent, and the importance of elevating marginalized voices within church spaces. Whether you have fond memories of camp or are re-examining its impact, this episode offers a nuanced look at the complexities, harms, and hopes for change in faith-based youth experiences.

For days, there was silence. No police reports. No media coverage. No public statements.\n\nI started asking questions.\n\nWhat I uncovered is deeply disturbing.\n\nIn this episode of the Preacher Boys Podcast, I speak with Pastor Bob Gray II of Emmanuel Baptist Church in Longview, Texas\u2014a church with a complex and controversial history. Through our conversation, I confirmed that an allegation of abuse involving a teenage girl surfaced on the very day of Forgy\u0027s death. What followed was a series of decisions that would change the trajectory of several lives.\n\nThis episode dives into a decades-old abuse allegation, the legacy of Longview Baptist Temple, and the culture of silence that has plagued the Independent Fundamental Baptist movement.\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nCONNECT WITH THE SHOW:\n\npreacherboyspodcast.com\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/preacherboyspod\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod\n\nTo connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nThe content presented in this video is for informational and educational purposes only.

Beneath its polished surface, however, Grenville hid decades of coercion, public shaming, weaponized religion, and psychological abuse. Beth courageously shares her experience of being separated from her parents, subjected to strict diets and public humiliation from the age of five, and living under the rule of the enigmatic \u201CMothers\u201D\u2014leaders whose influence transformed the school into a cult hiding in plain sight.\n\nBeth discusses the unique matriarchal leadership at Grenville, the devastating impact of purity culture and body shaming, and the lifelong effects of religious trauma. She also details her role in spearheading a 16-year landmark class action lawsuit that set a historical precedent for abuse survivors in Canada.

From the Independent Fundamental Baptist (IFB) movement to the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC) to the bizarre teachings of Doug Wilson, this discussion dives into the challenges of addressing spiritual abuse, the personal toll of advocacy work, and the shared mission of amplifying survivor voices. Topics: The origins of both podcasts and their focus on exposing abuse in fundamentalist and reformed circles. Personal experiences that led Eric and Peter to start their respective shows. The intersection of theology, culture, and abuse in religious communities. How survivors are finding their voices and building supportive communities. The challenges of being a public advocate for change in faith-based spaces. \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F Preacher Boys Podcast: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/preacher-boys-podcast/id1493726980 Sons of Patriarchy Podcast: https://sonsofpatriarchy.com/ \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F Support the Show: Patreon.com/PreacherBoys \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F If you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F CONNECT WITH THE SHOW: preacherboyspodcast.com https://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc https://www.instagram.com/preacherboyspod https://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/ \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F The content presented in this video is for informational and educational purposes only.

      "description": "This week, former Thomas Road Baptist Church (TRBC) pastor Sergio Guardia was found guilty on all three counts, including Stalking and Breaking and Entering, according to court documents. The case, which has garnered significant local attention, reveals disturbing patterns\u2014not only in Guardia\u2019s actions but also in TRBC\u2019s failure to protect the victim and its continued support of the convicted abuser. Marie Columna, the victim, courageously testified in court this week, delivering her witness statement with the support of several victims\u2019 advocates who traveled to stand by her side. She has chosen to speak out publicly and is available for interviews. One of the most shocking aspects of the case is that Guardia was caught on camera breaking into Columna\u2019s home. Despite this clear evidence, TRBC failed to stand with the survivor. Instead, they treated her poorly and chose to support the convicted pastor. This is about more than just one case; there appear to be other victims and a larger story that needs to be investigated. The way TRBC handled this is deeply concerning\u2014not just for Columna, but for anyone who has suffered abuse within their religious institutions. The case raises even greater concerns due to TRBC\u2019s close ties to Liberty University, which was recently fined $14 million for its mishandling of sexual assault cases. This apparent pattern of neglect and institutional protection of abusers demands further investigation. \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F Support the Show: Patreon.com/PreacherBoys \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F If you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F CONNECT WITH THE SHOW: preacherboyspodcast.com https://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc https://www.instagram.com/preacherboyspod https://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/ \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F The content presented in this video is for informational and educational purposes only.

This is a controversial stance for faith groups like the Washington State Catholic Conference, which strongly oppose it.\n\nI spoke with Sen. Frame today to learn why bills like this have historically stalled, her response to critics of the bill, and how her own experience as a survivor highlights the importance of mandatory reporting. I also asked her how people across the country can support this bill.\n\nThis is, of course, a very busy time for Senator Frame, and I really appreciate her taking a few minutes today to step aside and discuss SB 5375.\n\nFor context and clarity, this call took place today, March 11th, at 5:37 PM. The call lasted 8 minutes, and her answers are completely unedited.\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nSupport the Show: Patreon.com/PreacherBoys\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nIf you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nCONNECT WITH THE SHOW:\n\npreacherboyspodcast.com\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/preacherboyspod\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod\n\nTo connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nThe content presented in this video is for informational and educational purposes only.

      "description": "In March 2024, Trieber settled a lawsuit for an undisclosed amount after two women came forward with horrifying claims of abuse and cover-ups involving his brother-in-law, Mike Strouf.\n\nFast forward to February 2025: Strouf\u2019s name was removed from marquee signs at Santa Clara\u2019s Magical Bridge Playground after information about the lawsuit and victim stories was sent to city officials. But instead of showing remorse or addressing the abuse, Trieber took the pulpit to complain about how hard it is for him to deal with lawsuits.\n\nI break down his troubling response, including his denial of covering up abuse and his attacks on critics\u2014calling them \u201Cliars,\u201D \u201Csodomites,\u201D and \u201Clesbians.\u201D Despite his loud proclamations, the victims\u2019 stories paint a very different picture: one where Trieber protected abusers and silenced victims.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the kicker: just days ago, Santa Clara Mayor Lisa Gillmor honored Trieber and North Valley Baptist Church with an award, completely ignoring decades of allegations and lawsuits tied to his ministry. It\u2019s yet another example of how institutions sweep serious claims under the rug when it\u2019s convenient.\n\nJoin me as I unpack this disturbing story and expose the tactics used by leaders like Trieber to avoid accountability.\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nSupport the Show: Patreon.com/PreacherBoys\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nIf you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nCONNECT WITH THE SHOW:\n\npreacherboyspodcast.com\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/preacherboyspod\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod\n\nTo connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nThe content presented in this video is for informational and educational purposes only.

      "description": "Read about growing up within a patriarchal fundamentalist religion from a female perspective:\n\nhttps://open.substack.com/pub/thebubbleverse/p/cant-keep-sweet?r=2xfl7u\u0026utm_campaign=post\u0026utm_medium=web\u0026showWelcomeOnShare=true \n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nSupport the Show: Patreon.com/PreacherBoys\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nIf you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nBill Maher recently took aim at Nike\u2019s Super Bowl commercial, which celebrated the growth and resilience of female athletes despite constant adversity and culturally-imposed limitations.The ad was narrated by rapper Doechii and featured nine female athletes: Jordan Chiles, Caitlin Clark, A\u2019ja Wilson, JuJu Watkins, Sabrina Ionescu, Alexia Putellas, Aryna Sabalenka, Sha\u2019Carri Richardson and Sophia Smith. It ended with the powerful tagline: \u201CWhatever you do, you can\u2019t win \u2014 so win.\u201D\n\nThe ad had it\u2019s fair share of praise and critics, with TV host Bill Maher planting his flag in the latter camp.On a recent episode of Real Time with Bill Maher, (airdate 2.14.25), called the message of the commercial a \u201Czombie lie.\u201D\n\n\u201CIt means like something used to be true, and it stopped being true. And then people kept saying it. I feel like this is a giant zombie lie,\u201D Maher argued. \u201CI mean, when was the last time a woman was told, \u2018You can\u2019t do this? You can\u2019t be confident?\u2019 Who are these imaginary, mean old men of the patriarchy?\u201D\n\nWell, Bill, \u201Cthe mean old men of the patriarchy\u201D aren\u2019t imaginary. In fact, they are all across America. In fact, many of them are pastors, Sunday school teachers, and some have even started Bible colleges.\n\nWhen I was growing up in a fundamentalist Christian community, the idea that women could \u201Cdo anything\u201D was not just discouraged\u2014it was actively opposed.\n\nOn my podcast, Preacher Boys, I\u2019ve spent years exposing how religious institutions\u2014particularly in Independent Fundamental Baptist (IFB) circles\u2014perpetuate strict and archaic gender roles. These roles aren\u2019t just suggestions in that world. They are codified into church doctrine, college curricula, and life expectations.\n\nTake Hyles-Anderson College, one of the more well-known IFB institutions. While men at the school can pursue theological degrees, pastoral studies, and climb their way into powerful leadership roles, women are encouraged to enroll in programs like Marriage and Motherhood. (Yes, that\u2019s an actual college course.)\n\nThe curriculum includes credits for \u201CCanning and Freezing,\u201D \u201CHow to Rear Infants,\u201D \u201CScheduling Your Time,\u201D and, my personal favorite, \u201CCrock Pot Cooking.\u201DNotably absent? Any track leading to ordination, church leadership, or even a career outside of traditional homemaking.\n\nThe highest aspiration for many young women at these colleges isn\u2019t earning a degree but earning a husband. It\u2019s become a regular joke in these circles that \u201Cinstead of a BS or PHD, young women go to college for their \u201CMRS\u201D degree!\u201D Hardy har har.\n\nTo claim that patriarchal control is a thing of the past is to ignore millions of women who are still being told exactly what they can\u2019t do. It\u2019s to dismiss the experiences of women who are not allowed to preach, lead, or even work outside the home without backlash. It\u2019s to erase the reality of those raised in communities where obedience and submission aren\u2019t just encouraged but mandated. It\u2019s to ignore the fact that 83% of women in ministry positions are not paid.\n\nIt\u2019s bizarre to see Bill Maher, who has made a point to criticize fundamentalist religion in his stand-up, talk show, and an entire documentary, fails to consider the ongoing struggles of women still trapped in these systems.\n\nIn churches across America, women being held down by the patriarchy isn\u2019t a \u201Czombie lie.\u201D It\u2019s a nightmarish reality.\n\nSorry, Bill\u2014you missed the mark on this one.\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nCONNECT WITH THE SHOW:\n\npreacherboyspodcast.com\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/preacherboyspod\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod\n\nTo connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nThe content presented in this video is for informational and educational purposes only.

An academic by training and a pastor\u2019s wife by calling, Beth uses her unique voice to speak out on the relevance of medieval history to our modern world\u2014especially concerning women in both medieval and modern Christianity. Her work is described as \u201Csmart,\u201D \u201Cpowerful,\u201D and \u201Ca game changer\u201D for women in modern evangelicalism. \n\nBarr is currently the James Vardaman Professor of History at Baylor University, where she teaches both undergraduate and graduate courses, but she also speaks and writes as a public intellectual. She has been featured by NPR and The New Yorker, and her bylines include Religion News Service, The Washington Post, Christianity Today, The Dallas Morning News, Sojourners, and Baptist News Global. She also continues to write regularly on The Anxious Bench, a popular religious history blog on Patheos.\n\nAs a pastor\u0027s wife for twenty-five years, Beth Allison Barr has lived with assumptions about what she should do and who she should be.\n\nIn Becoming the Pastor\u0027s Wife, Barr draws on that experience and her academic expertise to trace the history of the role of the pastor\u0027s wife, showing how it both helped and hurt women in conservative Protestant traditions. While they gained an important leadership role, it came at a deep cost: losing independent church leadership opportunities that existed throughout most of church history and strengthening a gender hierarchy that prioritized male careers.\n\nBarr examines the connection between the decline of female ordination and the rise of the role of pastor\u0027s wife in the evangelical church, tracing its patterns in the larger history (ancient, medieval, Reformation, and modern) of Christian women\u0027s leadership. By expertly blending historical and personal narrative, she equips pastors\u0027 wives to better advocate for themselves while helping the church understand the origins of the role as well as the historical reality of ordained women.\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nSupport the Show: Patreon.com/PreacherBoys\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nIf you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nCONNECT WITH THE SHOW:\n\npreacherboyspodcast.com\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/preacherboyspod\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod\n\nTo connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nThe content presented in this video is for informational and educational purposes only.

(See \u0022Elisabeth Elliot, Flawed Queen of Purity Culture, and Her Disturbing Third Marriage,\u0022 the Revealer Magazine, a publication of the Center for Religion and Media at New York University).\n\nHer Substack newsletter, the Empathy List, has received recognition from the Webby Awards and the Best of the Church Press Awards. Her essays have won 3rd place in Dappled Things magazine\u2019s Jacques Maritain Prize for Nonfiction (in 2019 and 2022), and she\u0027s also been awarded two Collegeville Institute residencies.\n\nHer op-eds and stories have also been published in outlets such as the Huffington Post, Religion News Service, Hippocampus Magazine, Brevity, Sojourners, the Christian Century, Christianity Today, US Catholic, National Catholic Reporter, and more.\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nBook description:\n\nIn the beginning was a work of art.\n \nWhat does Bible study look like after inerrancy? Do you have to give up studying Scripture when you no longer believe in its literal interpretation? Can you still believe this book is sacred even while renegotiating your relationship to the church? In Knock at the Sky, Liz Charlotte Grant offers compelling answers to these questions and more in this deeply personal commentary on the book of Genesis.\n \nBraiding together encounters with the natural world, Jewish midrash, and art criticism, Grant makes familiar Sunday school stories strange and offers a fresh vision for reading Scripture after deconstruction. For those who have known the book of Genesis as a weapon in the culture wars, Grant interprets the Bible\u2019s inspired book of beginnings as a work of art. Lyrical, insightful, and highly original, Knock at the Sky offers readers a capacious model for seeking God through Scripture even as one\u2019s faith continues to evolve.\n \n\u201CIn this book, you too have permission to question the sacred without fearing . . . unbelief. Knock loudly. . . . Reject answers that do not admit complication. Seek the resonance at the base of the story. The seeking is the point. Because there, in your wandering, God is.\u201D\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nSupport the Show: Patreon.com/PreacherBoys\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nIf you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nCONNECT WITH THE SHOW:\n\npreacherboyspodcast.com\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/preacherboyspod\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod\n\nTo connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nThe content presented in this video is for informational and educational purposes only.

      "description": "Nothing like a bit of satanic panic to kick off the new year.\n\nPastors like Mark Driscoll and Daniel White are labeling the musical Wicked as \u201Cdemonic\u201D and accusing it of corrupting young minds. But here\u2019s the irony\u2014Wicked is all about challenging fear, prejudice, and black-and-white thinking.\n\nIn this video, I dive into their critiques and why they completely miss the mark. As a former fundamentalist, Wicked struck a personal chord with me. Its themes of questioning authority and redefining good and evil mirror real-life struggles within high-control religious communities.\n\nI also explore how Wicked invites us to think critically about the labels we place on others and the motives of those in power. Maybe that\u2019s why some pastors feel so uncomfortable with it\u2014it hits a little too close to home.\n\nJoin me as I unpack the controversy, reflect on Wicked\u2019s deeper meaning, and share why this misunderstood musical deserves more credit than it gets from its critics!\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nSources mentioned:\n\nPastor Mark Watches Wicked and Responds - https://youtu.be/mz_5OxyHRJc\n\n\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nIf you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nCONNECT WITH THE SHOW:\n\npreacherboyspodcast.com\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/preacherboyspod\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod\n\nTo connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nThe content presented in this video is for informational and educational purposes only.

      "description": "In this powerful episode of the Preacher Boys Podcast, I sit down with Beth White, a survivor of a harrowing marriage defined by abuse, gaslighting, and spiritual manipulation. Beth courageously opens up about her ex-husband Justin White\u0027s shocking transformation after an ayahuasca trip, where he claimed he was no longer alive but instead inhabited by higher beings.\nBeth says that, at times, Justin said he was God; other times, he denied God\u0027s existence entirely. He alternated between claiming to be Jesus, an angel of light, or something else altogether. This dangerous delusion culminated in a horrifying act: Justin drugged Beth and their young children in an attempt to bring them into his twisted spiritual visions.\nToday, Justin calls himself \u0022Justin Love\u0022 and claims to be a spiritual healer.\nBeth shares the dark truth about their marriage and the abuse she endured in this gripping conversation. Her bravery in recounting these events sheds light on the devastating impact of spiritual abuse and manipulation.\nThis episode also revisits prior coverage of Fellowship Baptist Church in Michigan, including interviews with victims and former members, shedding light on a disturbing culture of abuse, cover-ups, and silencing.\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nSupport the Show: Patreon.com/PreacherBoys\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nIf you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nCONNECT WITH THE SHOW:\n\npreacherboyspodcast.com\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/preacherboyspod\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod\n\nTo connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nThe content presented in this video is for informational and educational purposes only.

Reah shares her journey of self-discovery, exploring why she remained silent and complicit in the face of abuse, and how societal programming often conditions us to accept, or even enable, unacceptable behavior.\nThrough the lens of her experiences and her critically acclaimed book Complicit, Reah examines the larger systemic issues that perpetuate abuse in workplaces and beyond.

Jenna speaks to the frustration of being misunderstood, especially by individuals who fail to listen to the message behind her art. This video dives deep into the complexities of creating music that challenges powerful systems and the responsibility artists feel to hold these systems accountable.

      "description": "Watch Killer Body Count for FREE on Tubi: https://tubitv.com/movies/100019969/killer-body-count On this special Halloween bonus episode of the Preacher Boys Podcast, we dive into an interview from my Film School\u0027d YouTube channel, where I typically discuss the art of filmmaking with industry talents. Today, however, the crossover between my two worlds\u2014horror and religious trauma\u2014made this episode a perfect fit for Preacher Boys. I\u2019m sharing a portion of my conversation with screenwriter Jessica Landry, who recently penned Killer Body Count, a slasher film with a hauntingly familiar twist for our listeners. The plot centers around a teenage girl misdiagnosed as a \u0022sex addict\u0022 by her devout family and sent alone to a religious reform camp. But, in true horror style, things spiral when a masked killer targets the camp\u2019s residents one by one. Jessica and I discuss the religious undertones woven into the film, her inspiration for the story, and the biblical motifs that give a darkly ironic spin to each \u201Cdeath scene.\u0022 We also touch on Jessica\u2019s own journey, growing up in a religious environment and eventually identifying as an atheist. For horror fans and those interested in confronting the shadows of religious trauma, this episode has something unique to offer. Listen in for insights on how horror films can explore deep-seated fears around organized religion, shame, and identity, with a splash of classic slasher thrills. \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F Support the Show: Patreon.com/PreacherBoys \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F If you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F CONNECT WITH THE SHOW: preacherboyspodcast.com https://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc https://www.instagram.com/preacherboyspod https://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/ \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F The content presented in this video is for informational and educational purposes only.

      "description": "For Former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, service to country has been the guiding principle of his life and career \u2014 first as a member of the armed forces, and later as a lawmaker in the halls of Congress. When the strength of the nation was tested on January 6th, 2021 and in the months following, Kinzinger took his sworn oath further, boldly demonstrating an exceedingly rare loyalty to country over party.\nAs one of only two Republicans on the January 6th Committee, Rep. Kinzinger stood against his own party in pursuit of democracy and justice. Shortly after the insurrection at the Capitol, Congressman Kinzinger started the Country First movement, which has grown rapidly to over 100,000 members today and counting.\nFrom 2011-2022, Congressman Kinzinger served six terms in the United States House of Representatives, where he proudly represented Illinois\u2019 Sixteenth Congressional District, which stretches across 14 counties in Northern Illinois.\nWhile in Congress, Kinzinger served as a member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, where he served as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia, Energy and the Environment in the 116th Congress. He also served on the non-partisan Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol.\nHis top priorities included strengthening U.S. energy policy and making our nation less reliant on foreign resources as well as bolstering the strength of our national security \u2013both at home and abroad.\nPrior to being elected to Congress, Kinzinger served in the Air Force in both Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. Kinzinger continues to serve his country as a pilot in the Air National Guard, with the current rank of Lieutenant Colonel, and balanced this service with his duties in Congress.\nDuring his time in Congress, Kinzinger worked tirelessly for IL-16, and for the security of our nation. From getting veterans back to work, to combatting the opioid epidemic, Congressman Kinzinger fought for his constituents and stood up for America, keeping his oath to protect and defend our Constitution.\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nSupport the Show: Patreon.com/PreacherBoys\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nIf you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nCONNECT WITH THE SHOW:\n\npreacherboyspodcast.com\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/preacherboyspod\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod\n\nTo connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nThe content presented in this video is for informational and educational purposes only.

      "description": "In this video, I dive into the recent controversy surrounding Pastor Daniel White of Fellowship Baptist Church in Michigan. During a Sunday night prayer meeting, Pastor White made a cryptic statement revealing that two members of his congregation had been sent to prison. However, his vague remarks left the church with more questions than answers.\n\nAfter posting a clip of this moment on social media, the backlash from the church community was swift. Many were outraged by the lack of transparency from Pastor White and demanded further clarification. Despite promising more details during a Wednesday prayer meeting, he once again evaded critical questions, leaving his congregation in the dark.\n\nThis expos\u00E9 uncovers the textbook poor response of church leaders to cases of abuse within their community, as exemplified by Pastor White\u0027s handling of this situation. Through research into the charges brought against the convicted men and analysis of the church\u2019s own YouTube content, this episode showcases the failure of leadership to provide clarity and accountability.\n\nWatch the full video for an in-depth look at how Fellowship Baptist Church\u0027s leadership is failing its congregation. \n\nServices Mentioned:\n\nFull Sunday, Sept 22 Service: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=haWv0K_3TBA\n\nFull Wednesday, Sept 25 Service: https://www.youtube.com/live/nf11N9ufamA?si=UTjrP9l2IfY8vYVC\n\nReports Mentioned:\nhttps://www.justice.gov/usao-edmi/pr/former-mdoc-officer-sentenced-16-years-sexual-exploitation-children\n\nYou can find Josh\u0027s information by visiting \u2013\u00A0https://mijackson.org/1278/Case-Information \u2013\u00A0Case ID: 2024-0000004419-FC\n\n\nThis episode is sponsored by/brought to you by BetterHelp.

      "description": "Renowned historian and New York Times bestselling author, Kristin Kobes Du Mez (Jesus and John Wayne) explores the culture of submission and sexual abuse within the evangelical community in her riveting documentary, FOR OUR DAUGHTERS, available to stream on September 26.Directed by Emmy award-winning filmmaker Carl Byker, the film draws a direct line from the culture of abuse created by evangelical leaders to their fervent support for a presidential candidate who has bragged about abusing women.\n\nFor Our Daughters is available online September 26.\n\nFOR OUR DAUGHTERS features sit-down interviews with victims and whistleblowers of sexual abuse in the SBC, including acclaimed author Christa Brown (Baptistland), featured in the landmark 2019 investigation from the Houston Chronicle and San Antonio Express-News. The groundbreaking report examined sexual misconduct reports across the Southern Baptist Convention, and found hundreds of church leaders and volunteers across 20 states who had been criminally charged with sex crimes since 2000, leading to more than 700 victims. Interviews with survivor-advocates Tiffany Thigpen, Jules Woodson, Rachael Denhollander (What Is a Girl Worth), and Cait West (Rift) are also featured, highlighting their efforts to bring justice and reform to the church.\n\nA timely exploration of the intersection between faith, politics, and women\u0027s rights in America, the film honors the brave survivors who have shared their stories, often at great cost. It delves into how the church has cared more about power and political influence than love, and how the harm done to women and children threatens to extend beyond faith communities given what is at stake this election season.\n\n\u0022Just months after Jesus and John Wayne released, three conservative evangelical women asked to speak with me,\u0022 says Du Mez. \u0022To my surprise, they thanked me and asked how they could help. \u0027It\u0027s too late for us,\u0027 they told me. \u0027We\u0027ve made our choices, and we can\u0027t walk away from the lives we\u0027ve made. But we want something different for our daughters.\u0027 I\u0027ve carried their words with me. This film is for them, and for their daughters.\u0022\n\nAbuse within the evangelical community starkly contradicts Jesus\u0027 teachings about women, which emphasize love, respect, and honor. By exposing the abuse and the abusers who distort God\u0027s name to justify their actions, FOR OUR DAUGHTERS challenges women to be a driving force within their own communities. The film calls on women of faith to raise their voices and wisely consider their vote as a means to protect the health, happiness, and liberties of their daughters and granddaughters.\n\nFOR OUR DAUGHTERS is executive produced by Kenneth Harbaugh, and Charlie Sadoff, and will be available to stream for free on YouTube starting September 26.Resources for sexual and spiritual abuse survivors can be found at forourdaughtersfilm.com.",

      "description": "Ashley Easter, grew up and lived in a cult for 22 years. Thankfully, she was able to break free and decided to take control of her life. This journey was not an easy one. But with the help of her husband, Will Easter, Ashley began experiencing healing and empowerment. As a survivor, Ashley spoke out about her past and the challenges she had overcome. As a result, hundreds of abuse survivors reached out describing their experiences. Knowing she was not alone, Ashley realized she had to do something. The result was the launch of The Courage Conference in 2016, which has since evolved into Courage 365. Today, Courage 365 inspires and transforms countless abuse survivors\u2019 lives through a community of understanding, inspiration, and empowerment. \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F Support the Show: Patreon.com/PreacherBoys \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F If you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F CONNECT WITH THE SHOW: preacherboyspodcast.com https://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc https://www.instagram.com/preacherboyspod https://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/ \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F Sources \u0026 Clips Referenced: \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F The content presented in this video is for informational and educational purposes only.

April just considered herself a good Christian: faithful, Republican, and determined to make America a Christian nation once again. But as her view of the world widened, Ajoy began to see cracks in her steadfast beliefs and recognized the ways her conservative politics and religion were intertwined in her mind. Did God really bless America? Is it actually by His red, white, and blue stripes that we are healed? Ajoy, content creator and podcast host, shares funny stories from her time deep within Christian nationalism, exploring how aspects of evangelical culture such as purity pledges, product boycotts, Satanic panic, and end-times theology have all been exploited to advance the Christian Nationalist narrative. She also illuminates the ways nationalist thinking has infiltrated our churches and political arenas, shaping not only modern evangelical culture but also American public policy and international relations. Part memoir, part guidebook, part call to action, Star-Spangled Jesus explores how the fight to make America a \u201CChristian nation\u201D has damaged us all and shows how one woman left Christian Nationalism and why America should too. \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F Support the Show: Patreon.com/PreacherBoys \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F If you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F CONNECT WITH THE SHOW: preacherboyspodcast.com https://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc https://www.instagram.com/preacherboyspod https://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/ This episode is sponsored by/brought to you by BetterHelp.

      "description": "For this podcast episode, I had the opportunity to sit down with Steven Clark, a courageous survivor of childhood sexual abuse, and his legal team, attorneys Aaron Blank and Guy D\u2019Andrea. Steven\u2019s case has garnered significant attention, as it has reached the Maryland Supreme Court, raising critical questions about the constitutionality of the Child Victims Act. In our conversation, Aaron and Guy provide an in-depth explanation of the legal battle they\u0027ve been fighting on Steven\u2019s behalf. They discuss the recent hearing in Hartford County where they successfully defended the validity of the Child Victims Act against a motion to dismiss by the Board of Education. This law, which extends or eliminates deadlines for survivors to bring claims, is being challenged as unconstitutional. Now, with the Maryland Supreme Court taking up the case, the stakes couldn\u0027t be higher. The Court\u0027s decision will not only impact Steven\u2019s pursuit of justice but could also influence the future of many others who have suffered similar trauma. The outcome will determine whether the Child Victims Act stands as a beacon of hope for survivors or if it will be struck down, closing the door on their opportunity for legal redress. Join us as we delve into the complexities of this case, explore the potential implications of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, and hear from Steven himself about his journey and fight for justice. \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F Support the Show: Patreon.com/PreacherBoys \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F If you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F CONNECT WITH THE SHOW: preacherboyspodcast.com https://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc https://www.instagram.com/preacherboyspod https://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/ This episode is sponsored by/brought to you by BetterHelp.

The discourse and arguments being made by this group were so silly that we just had to take a bit of time to talk about it.

I unequivocally condemn political and religious violence in any form, and I believe that those who make threats of this sort should be investigated. I have reported both Zhong and his church, Sure Foundation Baptist Church, to the FBI for terrorist threats. I encourage others to report to the proper channels - including local Indianapolis law enforcement and federal agencies that handle these types of threats. In case you\u2019d like to file a report - here are the details: Pastor: Justin Zhong Church: Sure Foundation Baptist Church Address: 3037 LaFayette Rd. Indianapolis, IN 46222 NOTE: Do not personally retaliate against Zhong or SFBC with physical or verbal threats and intimidation. All I encourage you to do is spread awareness and ensure it gets to the proper channels. \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F Support the Show: Patreon.com/PreacherBoys \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F If you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F CONNECT WITH THE SHOW: preacherboyspodcast.com https://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/ This episode is sponsored by/brought to you by BetterHelp.

      "description": "Grab your copy of A Well-Trained Wife: https://amzn.to/4dbE3aE \u201CRecruited into the fundamentalist Quiverfull movement as a young wife, Tia Levings learned that being a good Christian meant following a list of additional life principles\u2013\u2013a series of secret, special rules to obey. Being a godly and submissive wife in Christian Patriarchy included strict discipline, isolation, and an alternative lifestyle that appeared wholesome to outsiders. Women were to be silent, \u201Ckeepers of the home.\u201D Tia knew that to their neighbors her family was strange, but she also couldn\u2019t risk exposing their secret lifestyle to police, doctors, teachers, or anyone outside of their church. Christians were called in scripture to be \u201Cin the world, not of it.\u201D So, she hid in plain sight as years of abuse and pain followed. When Tia realized she was the only one who could protect her children from becoming the next generation of patriarchal men and submissive women, she began to resist and question how they lived. But in the patriarchy, a woman with opinions is in danger, and eventually, Tia faced an urgent and extreme choice: stay and face dire consequences or flee with her children. Told in a beautiful, honest, and sometimes harrowing voice, A Well-Trained Wife is an unforgettable and timely memoir about a woman\u2019s race to save herself and her family and details the ways that extreme views can manifest in a marriage. \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F Support the Show: Patreon.com/PreacherBoys \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F If you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F CONNECT WITH THE SHOW: preacherboyspodcast.com https://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/ This episode is sponsored by/brought to you by BetterHelp.

      "description": "On November 13, 2020, I shared an episode of the Preacher Boys Podcast featuring Bruce Kennedy discussing his experiences at North Valley Baptist Church in Santa Clara, CA. On the episode, we discussed several scandals relating to this particular ministry, and one in particular was that of Norlan Macias - a former member of North Valley Baptist Church. Today, almost 4 years later, Macias has been arrested. The following is a statement from the County of Santa Clara: For release on July 11, 2024 CONTACT: Joanna Lee Deputy District Attorney Sexual Assault Unit (408) 792-1025 joalee@dao.sccgov.org South Bay janitor charged with felony molestation A South Bay man has been charged with sexually molesting teenaged children during church trips at his house on a Morgan Hill lake. The case against 54-year-old Norlan Macias, of San Jose, was launched several years ago when a retired police officer heard a man describing a molestation on a podcast called, \u201CPreacher Boys.\u201D Macias is charged with molestations that happened during a period that lasted longer than a decade, between 2001-2012. Police and prosecutors are seeking others who may have been victims of the South Bay man, who was a janitor at the Campbell Union and Mountain View school districts. Macias faces 11 counts of felony sexual molestation of five minors, ranging from 8 to 17. He will be arraigned this afternoon at 1:30 in department 23 in the Hall of Justice in San Jose. If convicted, he could face life in prison. \u201CI would like to thank the retired police officer for his diligence and dedication,\u201D District Attorney Jeff Rosen said. \u201CAs with many officers, his mission of protecting our community\u2019s children never stopped. I hope all of us take that same responsibility.\u201D The case against Macias began in 2020, when a retired San Jose Police Officer recognized Macias from the video podcast, which documents child abuse associated with religious institutions. He called 911. The defendant used to take a group of teenage parishioners of the North Valley Baptist Church out on a boat at Lake Anderson in Morgan Hill. The boys would then go to the defendant\u0027s house in Morgan Hill, where the molestations took place. While investigating this case, a detective stumbled on a 2013 report by a minor who said that he, too, was molested by Macias. He stated that the defendant lived near him and that he molested him after hiring him to do work on his home. After the initial statement, that case was closed due to lack of victim cooperation. If anyone has any information about the suspect and molestation, they should contact Deputy District Attorney Joanna Lee at joalee@dao.sccgov.org. MY STATEMENT: I\u0027ve been a public advocate against clergy abuse for nearly four and a half years. It can often feel discouraging and frustrating when no one with power seems to be listening and pushing for real change. I\u0027ve talked with many victims who have expressed the same sentiment. Today is a reminder of the importance of not remaining silent. It is a reminder that our voices hold power. I\u0027m thankful for the bravery of Bruce Kennedy in sharing his experiences with Norlan Macias and at North Valley Baptist Church on my podcast in 2020. I\u0027m also thankful for the law enforcement officer who heard this message and decided to look into the case. They are both heroes. It is my hope this story encourages survivors in similar high-control religious groups to find their voices and speak out, so justice can continue to be carried out. \u0026#xfeff;\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F Support the Show: Patreon.com/PreacherBoys \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F If you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F CONNECT WITH THE SHOW: preacherboyspodcast.com https://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/ Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donations Advertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brands Privacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

      "description": "Check out the Psycho-Therapy Podcast:\nhttps://rebrand.ly/psychotherapypodcast\n\nCheck out Figuring It Out: https://www.youtube.com/@figuringitouttv/videos\n\nWelcome to the Preacher Boys Podcast! In this episode, we delve deep into the importance of inclusivity and diversity in the healing journey from trauma and abuse. My guest today is Ashley Easter, the founder of Courage 365, an organization dedicated to supporting abuse survivors.\n\nFor more information about Courage365, visit: courage365.org\n\nOur discussion begins with recognizing that many individuals feel underrepresented in popular media and forums. This feeling can create barriers to healing, as people struggle to see their unique experiences reflected in the resources available to them. Ashley shares personal insights on this issue, emphasizing why it\u2019s crucial to have diverse voices in conversations about abuse and healing.\n\nThe conversation continues by explaining how abuse impacts different communities uniquely. We highlight how identity-based abuses intersect with classic abuse terms, particularly within LGBTQ\u002B, Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities. These communities face additional layers of challenges due to stereotypes and societal pressures, making their healing journeys distinct from those of others.\n\nThe episode also addresses the dangers of the \u0022trauma Olympics,\u0022 where individuals compare their trauma to others\u0027. This comparison can hinder personal healing by invalidating one\u0027s own experiences. We explore the gender-specific impacts of purity culture, showing how both men and women are adversely affected in different ways. This segment underscores the need for resources that address these unique impacts.\n\nFor those looking for more support, the Courage 365 website offers extensive resources, including a Need Help page and a list of free e-books. Joining the Courage 365 Facebook group can also provide a platform to ask questions and share experiences, fostering a supportive community.\n\nStay connected with us for more insightful discussions and resources to support your healing journey.\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\nSupport the Show: Patreon.com/PreacherBoys\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\nIf you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\nCONNECT WITH THE SHOW:\npreacherboyspodcast.com\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys\nhttps://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\nhttps://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc\nhttps://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod\n\nTo connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/\n\n*as an amazon associate I may receive a small commission on purchases made through links in these show notes\n\n\nSupport this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donations\n\nAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brands\n\nPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

      "description": "I highly encourage you to watch the past interview with Cathy that we referenced in the episode: https://youtu.be/DoPQVDE9c7k \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F \u0026#xfeff;Grab a copy of Ryan\u0027s book: https://amzn.to/45j7dl4 \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F BOOK DESCRIPTION: What would you do if you learned\u2014from a podcast\u2014that your dad (a pastor) was a serial sexual abuser? For Ryan George, this isn\u0027t a hypothetical question. He knew the faces behind the stories he heard. In fact, his mind flashed with memories of the abuse he\u0027d endured from that same pastor as he listened to news that would change his life. In time, as he processed the destruction rampant in the cult of his youth, he found predatory behavior to be more of a feature than a bug of his former religion as both abuse and coverups were baked into its theology. Rather than spiral into an understandable deconstruction of his faith, Ryan instead leaned into the intimate embrace of a winsome Jesus. His book, Hurt and Healed by the Church details how he untangled Jesus from the harmful tenets of American fundamentalism. Ryan describes the mental shifts and the restorative relationships he experienced on his journey of healing from church trauma and spiritual manipulation. If you are someone looking to heal church hurt\u2014by leaders or institutions\u2014Ryan shows how rebuilding your faith doesn\u0027t have to look like abandonment. He offers hope and inspiration through his story of an unorthodox redemption. If Ryan could find a thriving and contagious faith after experiencing deep church wounds, so can you. \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F Support the Show: Patreon.com/PreacherBoys \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F If you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F CONNECT WITH THE SHOW: preacherboyspodcast.com https://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/ *as an amazon associate I may receive a small commission on purchases made through links in these show notes Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donations Advertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brands Privacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

      "description": "On June 2nd, 2023, the documentary series \u0022Shiny Happy People\u0022 premiered on Amazon Prime. While the series\u0027 tagline promised to expose some Duggar family secrets, it ended up revealing much more, particularly the work and philosophy of Bill Gothard, the creator of the Institute in Basic Life Principles and the Advanced Training Institute. Gothard\u0027s curriculum was marketed as extremely helpful for families in protecting their children, but it ultimately caused incredible harm. Today, a year after the series premiered on Amazon Prime, I\u0027m sitting down with one of the cast members of \u0022Shiny Happy People,\u0022 Lindsay Williams, to discuss her life journey from starting in IBGP at the age of eight to working alongside Bill Gothard one-on-one at headquarters. We even spent a good chunk of the conversation discussing Lindsay Williams\u0027 life now, both as an advocate and as a successful makeup artist who has worked with brands like Vogue and GQ. We explore what it\u0027s like transitioning from being a repressed homeschooler to working in the fast-paced world of beauty and fashion. It\u0027s an incredible conversation. I thoroughly enjoyed talking to Lindsay; we instantly became friends, and I\u0027m certain you\u0027ll love hearing from her in this episode of the Preacher Boys podcast. \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F Support the Show: Patreon.com/PreacherBoys \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F If you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F CONNECT WITH THE SHOW: preacherboyspodcast.com https://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/ *as an amazon associate I may receive a small commission on purchases made through links in these show notes Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donations Advertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brands Privacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

      "description": "Grab a copy of Cait\u0027s book, Rift: https://amzn.to/4dMIoBN Raised in the Christian patriarchy movement, Cait West was homeschooled and could only wear clothes her father deemed modest. She was five years old the first time she was told her swimsuit was too revealing and to go change. There would be no college in her future, no career. She was a stay-at-home daughter and would move out only when her father allowed her to become a wife. She was trained to serve men, and her life would never be hers. Until she escaped. In her gripping memoir, Rift, Cait West tells a harrowing story of chaos and control hidden beneath the facade of a happy family. Weaving together lyrical meditations on the geology of the places her family lived with her story of spiritual and emotional manipulation as a stay-at-home daughter, Cait creates a stirring portrait of one young woman\u0027s growing awareness that she is experiencing abuse. With the ground shifting beneath her feet, Cait mustered the courage to break free from all she had ever known and choose a future of her own. Rift is a story of survival. It\u0027s also a story about what happens after you survive. With compassion and clarity, Cait explores the complex legacy of patriarchal religious trauma in her life, including the ways she has also been complicit in systems of oppression. A remarkable literary debut, Rift offers an essential personal perspective on the fraught legacy of purity culture and recent reckonings with abuse in Christian communities. \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F Support the Show: Patreon.com/PreacherBoys \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F If you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F CONNECT WITH THE SHOW: preacherboyspodcast.com https://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/ *as an amazon associate I may receive a small commission on purchases made through links in these show notes Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donations Advertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brands Privacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

      "description": "On today\u2019s episode, I\u2019m sitting down with Meg Applegate, the CEO of Unsilenced Project Inc., a non-profit on a mission to stop institutional child abuse by empowering self-advocates to promote lasting social change. At the age of 15, Meg was abducted by two strangers in the middle of the night from her California home and was told that \u201Cshe was coming with them.\u201D 8 hours later, she found herself at a lockdown treatment facility in Boise, Idaho. Then, 6 months later, she found herself in an additional behavioral modification program in northern Montana, where she spent the next 3 years. After graduating college with a degree in psychology, completely oblivious to the abuse she had experienced, Meg spent the next 17 years dedicating her life to serving on various non-profit boards to help them with board development and recruitment and expanding their programs to further their impact. It wasn\u2019t until she was well into her non-profit career that she woke up to the abuse and brainwashing that plagued her childhood and the effect it had on her entire adulthood. It was then that she became determined to pair her love of giving back and helping those in need with her dedication to empowering other survivors of institutional abuse. Meg brings to Unsilenced an extensive background in non-profit management, board development, and fund development. She is currently the Vice President, Trustee, and Managing Director at the Gochnauer Foundation. In addition, she is actively involved with and serves on the Board of Directors at Laura\u2019s House in Aliso Viejo, CA, and The Shea Center in San Juan Capistrano, CA. When she doesn\u2019t find herself fully immersed in new ideas for fundraising and development, Meg loves traveling to see new places with her husband and 4 children. \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F Support the Show: Patreon.com/PreacherBoys \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F If you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F CONNECT WITH THE SHOW: preacherboyspodcast.com https://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/ Our Sponsors: * Check out Factor and use my code preacherboys50 for a great deal: www.factor75.com Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donations Advertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brands Privacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

      "description": "Scott Coley exposes the inner workings of the religious right\u2019s propaganda\u2014and how Christians can resist it. Good evangelical Christians are Republican. It seems like it\u2019s always been this way. That means the propaganda is working. Scott Coley trains a critical eye on the fusion of evangelicalism and right-wing politics in Ministers of Propaganda. This timely volume unravels rhetoric and biblical prooftexting that support Christo-authoritarianism: an ideology that presses Christian theology into the service of authoritarian politics. Coley\u2019s historically informed argument unsettles evangelical orthodoxy on issues like creation science or female leadership\u2014convictions not as unchanging as powerful religious leaders would have us believe. Coley explains that we buy into propaganda because of motivated reasoning, and when we are motivated by perceived self-interest, the Christian message is easily corrupted. But if we recover Jesus\u2019s commandment to love our neighbors as ourselves, right-wing propaganda will lose its power.

      "description": "I came across a video on Instagram recently of famous pornstar Asa Akira, who eventually became Pornhub\u2019s Ambassador and host of the Pornhub Podcast in 2018. This clip was from a 2012 episode of her original podcast, DVDASA, which she co-hosted with actor and artist David Choe, who you might recognize from the hit Netflix series Beef. It\u2019s admittedly an older clip, but it\u2019s new to me \u2013 and I want to talk about it because the viewpoints expressed in the video have been regurgitated many times before and many times since, and they\u2019re just as harmful now as they\u2019ve ever been. \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F Resources Mentioned: \u2013 Try Audible Premium Plus and Get Up to Two Free Audiobooks: https://amzn.to/4adt2nS \u2013 Men Too: Unspoken Truths About Male Sexual Abuse: https://amzn.to/3xnlBfj \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F If you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F CONNECT WITH THE SHOW: preacherboyspodcast.com https://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/ \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F **DISCLAIMER: I may receive affiliate commissions through some links shared in these show notes.

      "description": "First coverage of the lawsuit: https://youtu.be/I6laSC_E3ZY Multiple sources close to North Valley Baptist Church in Santa Clara, California, stated that after the evening service on Wednesday, March 13, the livestream was shut off. After the livestream ended, Pastor Jack Trieber and his staff informed the church body in the auditorium that they had settled a lawsuit. The lawsuit in question was one I reported on recently -\u2013 which was filed on October 19, 2022, by two women, Christina Cheetham and Kim Craig, against North Valley Baptist Church and former youth pastor Mike Strouf, alleging abuse that took place near the end of the 1980s. Fred Slye, the business manager for the church, read a statement from the pulpit, saying that police were called 34 years ago, and it was dealt with, and that they needed to settle the lawsuit. Trieber and staff also allegedly communicated to the church that they could have bankrupted the church or put it in significant financial debt and had to sell one property if they did not settle. And, of course, the congregation was encouraged not to listen to \u201Crumors.\u201D I\u2019ve been following this case closely since almost the time when the Preacher Boys podcast started. In fact, on December 9, 2020, I conducted a podcast interview with Christina Cheetham. The interview was just under two hours in length, with Christina detailing her grooming and abuse at the hands of Mike Strouf, former youth pastor of North Valley Baptist Church in Santa Clara, California. At our recording time, Christina was unsure of avenues to pursue legal action against Strouf due to stringent statute of limitations laws. We agreed to keep the episode from being released while Christina searched for ways to pursue justice. Christina discovered that in 2019, California Assembly Bill Number 218 had amended the law about civil suits for recovery of damages from alleged childhood sexual abuse. The Bill prescribed an amendment and expansion of the definition of \u201Cchildhood sexual abuse,\u201D extension of the statute of limitations for commencement of civil suits for same, allowance of recovery of up to treble damages under certain circumstances involving a cover-up of childhood sexual assault, revival of specific childhood sexual assault claims, and exemption from the Government Tort Claims Act\u2019s \u201Cclaims-presentation\u201D requirements for childhood sexual assault claims. This gave Christina an unprecedented opportunity to take legal action. Until today, Christina has made no public statement regarding her story of abuse. I will indeed be sitting down with her again in the future to record an entirely new conversation. However, in the meantime, with her permission, I returned to our 2020 interview to pull key clips from her story to add her voice to the stories being shared regarding the lawsuit. \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F If you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F CONNECT WITH THE SHOW: preacherboyspodcast.com https://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/ Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donations Advertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brands Privacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

How did he get an audience in the first place when he has constantly made disgusting statements about women, flaunts a lifestyle of excess, and carries around an impressively large ego?\nMy theory is that as much as Andrew Tate claims to be countercultural and outside society\u2019s expectations, his lifestyle is an unfortunate representation of what society at large has been taught to value \u2013\u00A0sex, money, and power.\n\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\nIf you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help\n\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\n\nCONNECT WITH THE SHOW:\n\npreacherboyspodcast.com\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys\nhttps://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\nhttps://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc\nhttps://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod\nTo connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/\n\n\nSupport this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donations\n\nAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brands\n\nPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

      "description": "Shelise Ann Sola was born and raised in Utah with a long ancestry in Mormonism. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints was the only way to the highest level of heaven and she eagerly accepted the challenge. \u200BAn unfortunate turn of events led her to feeling worthless, small, dirty and unloved. It was in those moments of desperate solitude, she finally asked herself if this is what God REALLY wanted for her. \u200BDesperate to find the truth, she uncovered pages and pages of LDS church history that shocked her, shaking her faith in a way she had never imagined. She realized the church that she held so dear to her heart had been lying to her, her whole life. \u200BTen years later, she felt called to write her story in a memoir and decided to look further into the LDS history so she could accurately portray it in her book. With more and more shocking evidence unfolding, she became an ex-Mormon creator. Determined to expose the dark underbelly of these cults, with the help of her husband Jonathan, she amplifies the voices of other survivors of high control groups on Cults to Consciousness. \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F CONNECT WITH CULTS TO CONSCIOUSNESS @cultstoconsciousness https://www.youtube.com/cultstoconsciousness IG @cultstoconsciousness https://www.instagram.com/cultstoconsciousness/ \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F If you or someone you know has experienced abuse, visit courage365.org/need-help \u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F CONNECT WITH THE SHOW: preacherboyspodcast.com https://www.youtube.com/@PreacherBoys https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/ https://www.tiktok.com/@preacherboyspod To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/ Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donations Advertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brands Privacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

      "description": "Purchase a copy of Defending Democracy From Its Christian Enemies: https://amzn.to/3OS1Zps About David Gushee: Rev. Prof. Dr. David P. Gushee (PhD, Union Theological Seminary, New York) is Distinguished University Professor of Christian Ethics at Mercer University, and Chair of Christian Social Ethics at Vrije Universiteit (\u201CFree University\u201D) Amsterdam, and Senior Research Fellow, International Baptist Theological Study Centre. Gushee is the elected Past-President of both the American Academy of Religion and the Society of Christian Ethics, signaling his role as one of America\u0027s leading Christian ethicists. He is the author, co-author, editor, or co-editor of more than 28 books and over 175 academic book chapters, journal articles, and reviews (see his full academic C.V.). His most recognized works include Kingdom Ethics, and Changing Our Mind. His other most notable works are Introducing Christian Ethics, Still Christian, After Evangelicalism, Righteous Gentiles of the Holocaust, and the recent Defending Democracy from Its Christian Enemies. Altogether his books have sold over 100,000 copies and been translated into a dozen languages. For the general media, Gushee has written hundreds of opinion pieces and given interviews to scores of major outlets and podcasts. With his works read around the world, and an active lecturing schedule on several continents, he has global impact in the field of Christian ethics. A leader in the growing post-evangelical movement, he has also put feet to his faith in several activist campaigns. David and his wife Jeanie live in Atlanta. He is a classic novel reader, world traveler, and tennis player, and awaits a call from his beloved Atlanta Braves to resume the baseball career he abandoned in college. About Defending Democracy From Its Christian Enemies: American democracy is in danger. How do we protect it from reactionary authoritarian Christianity? On January 6, 2021, hundreds of Americans stormed the Capitol to prevent the certification of their political opponent\u2019s election. At the forefront were Christians claiming to act in the name of Jesus Christ and his supposed representative on earth, Donald Trump. How can this have happened? David P. Gushee tackles the question in this timely work of Christian political ethics. Gushee calls us to preserve democratic norms, including constitutional government, the rule of law, and equal rights for all, even as many Christians take a reactionary and antidemocratic stance. He analyzes where Christians have discarded their commitment to democracy and bought into authoritarianism in the US and several other countries, both historically and today. He urgently argues that to defend against reactionary and authoritarian Christians, we must revive and draw on our hard-won traditions of congregational democracy, dissident Black Christian politics, and covenantal theology. Defending Democracy from Its Christian Enemies makes a robust case for the defense of democracy from its enemies\u2014including Christians\u2014arguing for a renewed commitment to democracy on the part of Christians, by drawing on our own best traditions, not succumbing to mere secular liberalism. Any concerned Christian will leave this audio with eyes wide open to the dangers of our current form of political engagement. Listeners will gain insight into what democracy is truly meant to be and why Christians once supported it wholeheartedly\u2014and should do so again.

If you dress like that and you get raped, and I\u2019m on the jury, he\u0027s gonna go free.\u0022\n\nThe clip got a lot of exposure on social media - at the time of this recording, it has racked up nearly 200k views.\n\nIt caught the attention of several news stations, including the North Carolina NBC affiliate WCNC, who put together a story that ran February 22, 2024. They reached out to me for comment on the clip, and I\u2019ve linked to the article that features my interview with them in the description of this video.\n\nThe biggest takeaway I hope people have from reading the article, watching the clip, or listening to this podcast is that this is not an isolated incident or a one-off comment.

More than half a decade later, she continues to speak about those beginning years, what life in the Church was like, her decision to leave her only community and fundamentalist faith behind in order to find safety, freedom, happiness and the ability to practice free will. She writes about the struggles cult survivors of all stripes experience when leaving one life for the chance of another, and the journey towards healing after spiritual abuse. There\u0027s freedom in questions and hope for the formers.\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0FCONNECT WITH THE SHOW:- preacherboyspodcast.com- https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/- https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc- https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

      "description": "I initially interviewed Amanda Householder on June 10, 2020. During our conversation, she revealed that a staggering number of \u0022troubled teen homes\u0022 existed across the United States.Despite purporting to assist at-risk youth, these facilities often functioned as unregulated prisons, particularly those with a faith-based orientation, enjoying even less oversight due to religious exemptions.Amanda detailed various forms of physical, sexual, and mental abuse, encompassing forced starvation, force feedings, rape, molestation, beatings, and months of isolation.For Amanda, the fight against the troubled teen industry hits close to home, as she grew up in the Bible Belt, where her parents served as staff at the Agape Boarding School in Stockton, Missouri, before departing to establish their own unlicensed children\u0027s home called Circle of Hope.  Much has transpired since our initial conversation.Less than a year later, Amanda\u0027s parents, Boyd and Stephanie Householder, were arrested, facing 100 charges of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse allegedly occurring at their faith-based boarding school in Missouri. Consequently, Circle of Hope closed its doors.In January 2023, Agape Boarding School shut down following an extensive investigation and scrutiny. Additionally, in November 2023, Amanda\u0027s story was featured in the four-part documentary series \u0022Let Us Prey,\u0022 premiering on Investigation Discovery and currently available for streaming on Max.In this conversation, we delve into Amanda\u0027s participation in the production of \u0022Let Us Prey,\u0022 the current state of the Troubled Teen industry, and what the future holds for Amanda\u0027s activism.\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0FCONNECT WITH THE SHOW:- preacherboyspodcast.com- https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/- https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc- https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

Jill Duggar and her husband Derick are finally ready to share their story, revealing the secrets, manipulation, and intimidation behind the show that remained hidden from their fans.Jill and Derick knew a normal life wasn\u2019t possible for them. As a star on the popular TLC reality show 19 Kids and Counting, Jill grew up in front of viewers who were fascinated by her family\u2019s way of life. She was the responsible, second daughter of Jim Bob and Michelle\u2019s nineteen kids; always with a baby on her hip and happy to wear the modest ankle-length dresses with throat-high necklines. She didn\u2019t protest the strict model of patriarchy that her family followed, which declares that men are superior, that women are expected to be wives and mothers and are discouraged from attaining higher education, and that parental authority over their children continues well into adulthood, even once they are married.But as Jill got older, married Derick, and they embarked on their own lives, the red flags became too obvious to ignore.For as long as they could, Jill and Derick tried to be obedient family members\u2014they weren\u2019t willing to rock the boat. But now they\u2019re raising a family of their own, and they\u2019re done with the secrets. Thanks to time, tears, therapy, and blessings from God, they have the strength to share their journey. Theirs is a remarkable story of the power of the truth and is a moving example of how to find healing through honesty.\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0F\u2716\uFE0FRESOURCES MENTIONED:\u27A1\uFE0F My appearance on the Surviving Bob Jones University Podcast: https://bit.ly/3LrOfQi\u27A1\uFE0F 30 Days of Courage (FREE Virtual Event for Survivors): https://www.courage365.org/thirty\u27A1\uFE0F Past coverage of Mountain Avenue Baptist Church: https://youtu.be/zCi_4byxIVA\u27A1\uFE0F Purchase Counting the Cost: https://amzn.to/3LsOXNj________________Support the Preacher Boys Podcast:https://www.patreon.com/preacherboysPurchase a Preacher Boys shirt, mask, sticker, or other merch to rep the show! https://www.teepublic.com/user/preacher-boys-podcast________________CONNECT WITH THE SHOW:- preacherboyspodcast.com- https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/- https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc- https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community who shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

Cut off from anything unapproved by her father, Jessica was persistently curious about the outside world, always wondering what was normal or potentially dangerous about her upbringing.When the Willis family rocketed into fame after their appearances on multiple televised talent competitions in 2014, Jessica and her family landed their own reality TV show and toured across the globe, singing and dancing for millions. The world loved this beautiful family of kids; young and vivacious, the Willis\u0027s presented themselves to be extraordinary and happy.

      "description": "[This interview was recorded prior to the SAG-AFTRA strike.]Jon Snow is an actor and writer, but he is first and foremost the survivor of both a cult and of sexual abuse.Raised primarily in St. Louis, Missouri, Jon ran away from home and the cult when he was just 17 years old, between his junior and senior years of high school. The cult, the sexual assault, and the physical abuse endured by his mother left Jon feeling powerless. A young man without a voice.Not long after running away, acting came calling in the form of a mostly paid-for tuition at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. But even that was no walk in the park. He promptly failed out of college during his freshman year, after which he sheepishly returned to St. Louis.\u00A0Four years later, Jon returned to Dallas, and SMU, determined to pursue acting. Initially, he was rejected on the grounds that the theatre department did see enough evidence of growth. Not to be deterred, Jon fought for his spot and was readmitted to the acting program, graduating in 2002 with a BFA in Acting. Next came the move to Los Angeles and the pursuit of the Hollywood dream.But 15 years later, without much to show for an acting career, Jon realized he\u0027d only been running away from his past, and that if he ever wanted the future he dreamed of, then something had to change.\u00A0Through hustle and hard work, Jon was able to find a coveted position as a reader for multiple casting offices around Los Angeles. And now, having been a participant in over 10,000 auditions to date, he has started teaching other actors the insights he has gleaned during his time as a reader.\u200BToday, Jon\u0027s larger mission is to continue to find ways to deepen the connection to his voice and to reach back out to those who feel powerless, voiceless, alone, and afraid. Having walked that path, Jon can think of no better way than to shine a light in the darkness for others to follow. Even if it\u0027s just a single person, he knows it\u0027s all well worth the effort.\u00A0________________Support the Preacher Boys Podcast:https://www.patreon.com/preacherboysPurchase a Preacher Boys shirt, mask, sticker, or other merch to rep the show! https://www.teepublic.com/user/preacher-boys-podcast________________Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:\u2013 preacherboysdoc.com\u2013 https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\u2013 https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc-\u2013 https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

      "description": "Purchase a copy of She Deserves Better: https://amzn.to/40NMYZzArmed with data from an all-new survey of over 7,000 women, the authors of The Great Sex Rescue reveal how experiences in church as teens affect women\u0027s self-esteem and relationships today. They expose common evangelical teachings that can backfire--the purity emphasis that can cause shame rather than good choices, the dating rules that can prime your daughter for abuse, and the one overarching belief that can keep her from setting healthy boundaries.Instead, the authors advocate biblically grounded, freeing messages that are more about the dos and less about the don\u0027ts. By reframing (and sometimes replacing) common evangelical messages to teen girls, this book will equip you to raise a daughter who can navigate the tumultuous teenage years while still clinging tightly to Jesus.You can raise your daughter with the discernment to resist toxic teachings. Because she deserves better than a faith that keeps her small.Sheila Wray Gregoire is the face behind BareMarriage.com, an award-winning author, and a sought-after speaker. Rebecca Gregoire Lindenbach is a psychology graduate, Sheila\u0027s daughter, and the author of Why I Didn\u0027t Rebel. Joanna Sawatsky has a master\u0027s degree in public health and is a trained microbiologist, epidemiologist, and biostatistician.Together they are the coauthors of The Great Sex Rescue and She Deserves Better.Purchase a copy of The Great Sex Rescue: https://amzn.to/414EmgW________________Support the Preacher Boys Podcast:https://www.patreon.com/preacherboysPurchase a Preacher Boys shirt, mask, sticker, or other merch to rep the show! https://www.teepublic.com/user/preacher-boys-podcast________________Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:\u2013 preacherboysdoc.com\u2013 https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\u2013 https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc-\u2013 https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

      "description": "In episode #246, we discussed the resignation of Dr. Steve Pettit, president of Bob Jones University in South Carolina.Pettit took office in 2014, a year after a GRACE report that revealed how the college\u0027s leadership had mishandled numerous cases of abuse that occurred both on and off campus.Survivors claimed that in cases that took place at the school, proper authorities were not notified, and in many cases, victims in counseling at BJU were blamed for bringing the abuse on themselves.Many people hoped that Pettit\u0027s appointment would bring about much-needed change. However, on March 31, 2023, almost nine years after taking office, Pettit resigned from BJU.Just a few days before his resignation, he wrote a five-page letter that revealed several concerning issues about Dr. John Lewis, Chairman BJU\u0027s board of trustees.Pettit accused Lewis of holding off-site secret meetings without informing key university leadership, adopting a posture of secrecy and hostility toward the board and the administration. He also claimed that Lewis interfered with the reporting of a sexual harassment case to the school\u0027s designated Title IX coordinator, among other things. Pettit threatened to resign if Lewis remained in office.In a surprising turn of events, on April 6, Dr. John Lewis tendered his resignation as well.Dr. Steve Pettit (whose official final day at BJU is May 5th) issued a statement regarding Lewis\u2019 resignation, saying,\u201CLate this afternoon, I was notified that Bob Jones University Board of Trustees Chairman Dr. John Lewis has resigned from the Board of Trustees effective immediately. He has served BJU for 32 years as a board member and seven years as chairman. His desire was to honor the mission and vision of BJU and he worked tirelessly to that end. During his tenure, the University secured regional accreditation through SACSCOC and regained our tax exemption. I wish Dr. Lewis God\u2019s best.\u201DThe reason for Lewis\u2019 resignation has not immediately been given \u2013 it\u2019s also unclear whether Lewis\u2019 resignation will affect Pettit\u2019s decision to resign.Regardless, it\u0027s clear that change is coming to Bob Jones University.________________Support the Preacher Boys Podcast:https://www.patreon.com/preacherboysPurchase a Preacher Boys shirt, mask, sticker, or other merch to rep the show! https://www.teepublic.com/user/preacher-boys-podcast________________Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:\u2013 preacherboysdoc.com\u2013 https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\u2013 https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc-\u2013 https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

However, Emily also raises concerns about Jinger\u0027s continued reluctance to hold her parents accountable for their role in her upbringing.Another issue discussed in the episode is Jinger\u0027s problematic association with John MacArthur and her privileged position as a celebrity in evangelical culture. Emily brings up the experiences of other women who may have had different, less fortunate experiences.Finally, Emily and Eric delve into Jinger\u0027s word choice and whether or not she accurately labeled IBLP as a cult.Tune in to this thought-provoking conversation on the Preacher Boys podcast.________________Support the Preacher Boys Podcast:https://www.patreon.com/preacherboysPurchase a Preacher Boys shirt, mask, sticker, or other merch to rep the show! https://www.teepublic.com/user/preacher-boys-podcast________________Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:\u2013 preacherboysdoc.com\u2013 https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\u2013 https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc-\u2013 https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

Pettit also claims that Lewis has taken actions to obstruct and impede the university\u0027s Title XI investigation into a sexual harassment case.Pettit\u0027s resignation is a shocking development, given the hope many placed in him to bring positive change to the institution after the GRACE report revealed the mishandling of abuse cases at the university in the early 2010s.Eric reads much of Pettit\u0027s letter verbatim and discusses the implications of these allegations.________________Support the Preacher Boys Podcast:https://www.patreon.com/preacherboysPurchase a Preacher Boys shirt, mask, sticker, or other merch to rep the show! https://www.teepublic.com/user/preacher-boys-podcast________________Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:\u2013 preacherboysdoc.com\u2013 https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\u2013 https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc-\u2013 https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

      "description": "In this episode, host Eric Skwarczynski provides a scathing critique of a horrific sermon delivered by Evangelist Dean McNeese. McNeese refuses to call out predators by name, despite knowing their identities and instead promotes the idea of restoration for presumed predators.Furthermore, McNeese states that God will kill those who call out pastors \u0022the wrong way,\u0022 even if the pastor is morally wrong. These dangerous and harmful beliefs have no place in any religious institution and must be challenged and exposed.Join us as we delve deep into the disturbing world of toxic ministry and the individuals who perpetuate it.

It means that he will spend more time in prison than originally expected - 51 days to be exact.My personal opinion? The more time the better.________________Full Interrogation Audio:https://youtu.be/q1mHZim_mWM________________Support the Preacher Boys Podcast:https://www.patreon.com/preacherboysPurchase a Preacher Boys shirt, mask, sticker, or other merch to rep the show! https://www.teepublic.com/user/preacher-boys-podcast________________Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:\u2013 preacherboysdoc.com\u2013 https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\u2013 https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc-\u2013 https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

According to testimony from Webster County Attorney\u2019s Office Investigator Larry Hedlund, Webb had also been driving Giovanelli\u2019s car that week.He was charged with second-degree sexual abuse with persons under the age of 12 (a Class B Felony) and incest (a Class D Felony), as well as child endangerment (an Aggravated Misdemeanor).Marvin Smith IV, assistant pastor and missions director at Harvest Baptist Church submitted a letter in support of Webb for his bond hearing.In a text message conversation submitted into evidence by the state, Smith said to Webb, \u0022I\u0027m going to need to write a check to you for the lawyer fee.

      "description": "Purchase a copy of Celebrities for Jesus here: https://amzn.to/3S0DWngMany Christian leaders use their fame and influence to great effect. Whether that popularity resides at the local church level or represents national or international influence, many leaders have effectively said to their followers, \u0022Follow me as I follow Christ.\u0022 But fame that is cultivated for its own sake, without attendant spiritual maturity and accountability, has a shadow side that runs counter to the heart of the gospel. Celebrity--defined as social power without proximity--has led to abuses of power, the cultivation of persona, and a fixation on profits.In light of the fall of famous Christian leaders in recent years, the time has come for the church to reexamine its relationship to celebrity. Award-winning journalist Katelyn Beaty explores the ways fame has reshaped the American church, explains how and why celebrity is woven into the fabric of the evangelical movement, and identifies many ways fame has gone awry in recent years. She shows us how evangelical culture is uniquely attracted to celebrity gurus over and against institutions, and she offers a renewed vision of ordinary faithfulness, helping us all keep fame in its proper place.\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002BKATELYN BEATY is a journalist, editor, and keen observer of trends in the American church. She has written for the New York Times, the New Yorker, the Washington Post, Religion News Service, Religion \u0026 Politics, and The Atlantic and has commented on faith and culture for CNN, ABC, NPR, the Associated Press, and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. She is cohost of the Saved by the City podcast (Religion News Service) and previously served as print managing editor at Christianity Today. She\u2019s the author of Celebrities for Jesus: How Personas, Platforms, and Profits Are Hurting the Church (Brazos Press, 2022) and A Woman\u0027s Place: A Christian Vision for Your Calling in the Office, the Home, and the World (Simon \u0026 Schuster, 2016).\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002B\u002BSupport the Preacher Boys Podcast:https://www.patreon.com/preacherboysPurchase a Preacher Boys shirt, mask, sticker, or other merch to rep the show! https://www.teepublic.com/user/preacher-boys-podcast________________Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:\u2013 preacherboysdoc.com\u2013 https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\u2013 https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc\u2013 https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community that shares the Preacher Boys Podcast\u0027s mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

But evangelicalism is a space, not just a brand, and living in that space is complicated.As a lifelong evangelical who happens to be a biracial Asian/White millennial, Dan Stringer has felt both included and alienated by the evangelical community and has wrestled with whether to stay or go. He sits as an uneasy evangelical insider with ties to many of evangelicalism\u0027s historic organizations and institutions. Neither \u0022everything\u0027s fine\u0022 nor \u0022burn it all down,\u0022 Stringer offers a thoughtful appreciation of evangelicalism\u0027s history, identity, and strengths, but also lament for its blind spots, toxic brokenness, and complicity with injustice. From this complicated space, we can move forward with informed vision rather than resignation and with hope for our future together.________________Support the Show:https://www.patreon.com/preacherboysPurchase a Preacher Boys shirt, mask, sticker, or other merch to rep the show! https://www.teepublic.com/user/preacher-boys-podcast________________Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:\u2013 preacherboysdoc.com\u2013 https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\u2013 https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc\u2013 https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community who share the Eric Skwarczynski and the Preacher Boys Podcast mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

Raised by a Japanese father and an American mother, she was raised bilingually. (She honestly doesn\u0027t know which her first language was!)Unfortunately,\u00A0her home was not a safe place for children. Physical and verbal abuse were \u0022normal\u0022 in her home. After she became an adult, the relationship did not get any better.\u00A0In 2017, Isami became permanently estranged from her parents.\u00A0She was depressed and unable to see herself in a positive way. After much inner work and healing, she realized that the estrangement did not define her worth.\u00A0Having discovered this, her passion is to share the same empowerment by coaching, speaking, and creating content.Isami is a survivor of child sexual abuse and mental health advocate (Her abuser was also her church pianist from ages 9-almost 14).She was raised in church all of her life, but says she did not meet Jesus until she was 23.\u00A0It took being removed from my abusive home/church to realize her abusers and Jesus were completely opposite.She considers herself an anomaly. As most would (and understandably so) never want to have anything to do with God ever again.\u2795Isami has hosted safety/abuse seminars for church leaders\u2795Created content for those struggling with mental health\u2795Spoken on multiple podcasts/live videos across the globeShe has received some of the best diversity \u0026 inclusion training as a former international flight attendant and currently as an employee of Forbes top #2 largest employers to work for in the United States.She also has an international CPC coaching certification as well as an interdisciplinary studies degree in psychology/communications/design.And she wants to speak to your church/youth group/organization!If you are truly concerned about the safety of your congregation, want your staff to have a broader understanding of diversity \u0026 inclusion, and/or want someone to encourage your church/youth group/organization:Isami is here to help!Please feel free to reach out to her via email:Isamidaehn@gmail.com or on her website https://www.isamidaehn.com/________________Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:\u2013\u00A0preacherboysdoc.com\u2013\u00A0https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\u2013\u00A0https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc\u2013\u00A0https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community who share the Eric Skwarczynski and the Preacher Boys Podcast mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group:\u00A0https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

What are we missing in the story? And what difference does our interpretation of this passage make for women and men in the church?Caryn A. Reeder calls us to see the Samaritan woman in a different light. Beginning with the reception history of John 4, she pulls back layers of interpretation entangled with readers\u0027 assumptions on women and sexuality. She then explores the story\u0027s original context, describing life for women and expectations regarding marriage and divorce in the first century. With this clarified lens, Reeder\u0027s exegesis of the passage yields refreshing insights on what the Gospel says\u2015and does not say\u2015about the woman at the well.Throughout the book, Reeder draws connections between interpretations of this text and the life of the church. The sexual objectification of the Samaritan woman and minimization of her positive contribution has ongoing consequences for how women are seen and treated\u2015including in the failure of many Christian communities to respond well to accusations of abuse. In the age of #MeToo and #ChurchToo,\u00A0The Samaritan Woman\u0027s Story\u00A0offers a bold challenge to teach the Bible in a way that truly honors the value and voices of women.________________Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:\u2013\u00A0preacherboysdoc.com\u2013\u00A0https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\u2013\u00A0https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc\u2013\u00A0https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community who share the Eric Skwarczynski and the Preacher Boys Podcast mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group:\u00A0https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

After high school, she took her love for volleyball to Southern Utah University (SUU) where she was the setter and team captain on their very first volleyball team. While at SUU, she took a nutrition class and fell in love with food and how food impacts our health. In 2012, following a study abroad trip to Japan, she graduated with her Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Nutrition.Due to divine intervention, Dr. Burton was introduced to chiropractic and functional medicine the year following undergraduate school. She was mesmerized by the unique approach this type of medicine provided to patients and saw firsthand the impact it had on their health and lifestyle. Thus began her journey to becoming a chiropractor with a functional medicine specialty.

Throughout American history, Black people were not given the freedom to acknowledge their suffering. A. D. Thomason believes that the Holy Spirit brings freedom and liberation as we\u0027re able to name our pain, recognize its roots in history and society, and seek healing. While many saw a confident, six-foot-five Black man, A. D. \u0022Lumkile\u0022 Thomason lived most of his life in fear and anguish, deeply wounded by encounters with violence, abandonment, and family tragedy. Hiding behind a tough exterior, Adam earned his \u0022Black card\u0022 but felt joyless inside. Even traveling around the globe to play professional basketball could not resolve his despair. But in the art of Jay-Z, A. D. discovered stirring honesty that gave voice to his own expressions of longing. And in the gospel of Jesus, he experienced the healing and salvation that had long evaded him. Now through what he calls \u0022kingdom therapy,\u0022 he\u0027s figuring out how to redefine the Jay-Z and Jesus that make up his blackness. A. D. uses his artistry as a poet and storyteller to share how he confessed his internalized pain and embraced the liberating joy of Christ. He writes for millennials, emerging adults, and anyone else who\u0027s ready to acknowledge the reality of racial trauma and our need to confront it. A. D.\u0027s powerful story gives you permission to be Black, to be Christian, and to be the person God has made you to be.________________Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:\u2013\u00A0preacherboysdoc.com\u2013\u00A0https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\u2013\u00A0https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc\u2013\u00A0https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community who share the Eric Skwarczynski and the Preacher Boys Podcast mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group:\u00A0https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

      "description": "Purchase a copy of Heavy Burdens: https://amzn.to/3s0X0X6Religious faith reduces the risk of suicide for virtually every American demographic except one: LGBTQ people. Generations of LGBTQ people have been alienated or condemned by Christian communities. It\u0027s past time that Christians confronted the ongoing and devastating effects of this legacy.Many LGBTQ people face overwhelming challenges in navigating faith, gender, and sexuality. Christian communities that uphold the traditional sexual ethic often unwittingly make the path more difficult through unexamined attitudes and practices. Drawing on her sociological training and her leadership in the Side B/Revoice conversation, Bridget Eileen Rivera, who founded the popular website Meditations of a Traveling Nun, speaks to the pain of LGBTQ Christians and helps churches develop a better pastoral approach.Rivera calls to mind Jesus\u0027 woe to religious leaders: \u0022They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on the shoulders of others; but they themselves are unwilling to lift a finger to move them\u0022 (Matt. 23:4). Heavy Burdens provides an honest account of seven ways LGBTQ people experience discrimination in the church, helping Christians grapple with hard realities and empowering churches across the theological spectrum to navigate better paths forward.Support the Show:https://www.patreon.com/preacherboysPurchase a Preacher Boys shirt, mask, sticker, or other merch to rep the show!\u00A0https://www.teepublic.com/user/preacher-boys-podcast________________Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:\u2013\u00A0preacherboysdoc.com\u2013\u00A0https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\u2013\u00A0https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc\u2013\u00A0https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community who share the Eric Skwarczynski and the Preacher Boys Podcast mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group:\u00A0https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

      "description": "Dalene Joy Fisher (PhD, University of Kent) is assistant provost, dean, and associate professor of English at Oklahoma Wesleyan University.\u00A0She is the co-author of\u00A0Academic Writing and the Emerging Scholar.\u00A0She and her husband, Steven, have four adult children and live in Bartlesville, Oklahoma.\u00A0Purchase a copy of Dalene\u0027s book, Resisting the Marriage Plot, here: https://amzn.to/3qxvp0rBook Description:\u0022I cannot suppose any situation more distressing than for a woman of sensibility with an improving mind to be bound to such a man as I have described.\u0022Mary Wollstonecraft\u0027s response to one of her early critics points to the fact that fiction has long been employed by authors to cast a vision for social change. Less acknowledged, however, has been the role of the Christian faith in such works.In this latest volume in IVP Academic\u0027s Studies in Theology and the Arts series, literary scholar Dalene Joy Fisher explores the work of four beloved female novelists: Jane Austen, Anne Bront\u00EB, Elizabeth Gaskell, and Mary Wollstonecraft. Each of these authors, she argues, appealed to the Christian faith through their heroines to challenge cultural expectations regarding women, especially in terms of marriage. Although Christianity has all too often been used to oppress women, Fisher demonstrates that in the hands of these novelists and through the actions of their characters, it could also be a transformative force to liberate women.About Marbeth Skwarczynski:Though born on the east coast, I spent most of my life in the American Southwest, eventually settling in California where my husband and I raised two sons. Later we welcomed two fantastic daughters-in-law and four grandchildren into our family. After teaching history and literature for eighteen years, I resigned to write full-time. My preferred genre is Christian contemporary fiction. I keep my characters grounded in the real world and the real problems that Bible believers face today. While they grow, learn, and find possible solutions to their issues, my characters must also deal with the detritus of the past. Living well today doesn\u0027t mean that yesterday is erased. I write what I know, either first-hand or through close observation, injecting the joy, happiness, and humor that comes with spiritual freedom and love.Purchase Marbeth\u0027s book, Plague of Lies, here: https://amzn.to/3FtIjk5Support the Show:https://www.patreon.com/preacherboysPurchase a Preacher Boys shirt, mask, sticker, or other merch to rep the show! https://www.teepublic.com/user/preacher-boys-podcast________________Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:\u2013 preacherboysdoc.com\u2013 https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\u2013 https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc\u2013 https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community who share the Eric Skwarczynski and the Preacher Boys Podcast mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

Amy reaches out to Dr. Dolion for help with depression, but instead of providing healing, he leads her down a path of deception and betrayal. His office, which initially feels like a sanctuary, becomes a psychological prison, one from which Amy will have to fight to free herself.Prayed Upon, a true story depicts Amy\u2019s journey from victim to thriving child of God. Her brutal honesty provides an inside look at the warped beliefs that early abuse instills; beliefs that make adult victims vulnerable to sexual predators. Her story shines a light on the under-reported sexual abuse of adults and ultimately the way victims can gain freedom from the bondage of shame that abuse leaves behind.Support the Show:https://www.patreon.com/preacherboysPurchase a Preacher Boys shirt, mask, sticker, or other merch to rep the show! https://www.teepublic.com/user/preacher-boys-podcast________________Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:\u2013 preacherboysdoc.com\u2013 https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\u2013 https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc\u2013 https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community who share the Eric Skwarczynski and the Preacher Boys Podcast mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

      "description": "Purchase a copy of The Wisdom of Your Body: https://amzn.to/3ngISqiMany of us have a complicated relationship with our body.Maybe you\u0027ve been made to feel ashamed of your body or like it isn\u0027t good enough. Maybe your body is riddled with stress, pain, or the effects of trauma. Maybe you think of your body as an accessory to what you believe you really are--your mind. Maybe your experiences with racism, sexism, ableism, heterosexism, ageism, or sizeism have made you believe your body isn\u0027t the right kind of body. Whatever the reason, many of us don\u0027t feel at home in our bodies. But being disconnected from ourselves as bodies means being disconnected from truly living and from the interconnection that weaves us all together.Psychologist and award-winning researcher Hillary McBride explores the broken and unhealthy ideas we have inherited about our bodies. Embodiment is the way we are in the world, and our embodiment is heavily influenced by who we have been allowed to be. McBride shows that many of us feel disembodied due to colonization, racism, sexism, and patriarchy--destructive systems that rank certain bodies as less valuable, beautiful, or human than others. Embracing our embodiment can liberate us from these systems. As we come to understand the world around us and the stories we\u0027ve been told, we see that our perspective of reality often limits how we see and experience ourselves, each other, and what we believe is Sacred. Instead of the body being a problem to overcome, our bodies can be the very place where we feel most alive, the seat of our spirituality and our wisdom.The Wisdom of Your Body offers a compassionate, healthy, and holistic perspective on embodied living. Weaving together illuminating research, stories from her work as a therapist, and deeply personal narratives of healing from a life-threatening eating disorder, a near-fatal car accident, and chronic pain, McBride invites us to reclaim the wisdom of the body and to experience the wholeness that has been there all along. End-of-chapter questions and practices are included.\uFEFFSupport the Show:https://www.patreon.com/preacherboysPurchase a Preacher Boys shirt, mask, sticker, or other merch to rep the show! https://www.teepublic.com/user/preacher-boys-podcast________________Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:\u2013 preacherboysdoc.com\u2013 https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\u2013 https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc\u2013 https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community who share the Eric Skwarczynski and the Preacher Boys Podcast mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

In the last 15 years, she has joined with individuals, couples, and group members seeking relief.Claire believes that when we experience grief, trauma, life transitions, and relationship distress that our systems go offline. It is as if they are locked. Our mental, emotional, and physical states stop being able to work together. Counseling and therapy provide a place to cope, heal, or grow in ways that unlock those systems.

To protect children from abuse.The action and behavior of abusers directly affect children \u2013 that is, anyone under the age of 18. Grooming sets children up for exploitation from predators. Grooming also positions children to be vulnerable to future grooming and exploitation. Victims of abuse often spend a lifetime trying to sort through complex mental, emotional and physical trauma as a direct result of abusers. This has to stop!2. To protect adults from abuse.The action and behavior of abusers directly affect men, women, congregants, parents, the elderly, and\u2026 well it affects EVERYONE. Grooming affects the entire community by positioning people so as to serve the wicked wants \u0026 needs of the abuser. It also positions people so as to be more vulnerable to future grooming and exploitation. This abuse wrecks entire church communities. Abusers move on from church to church, checking the figurative doorknob, looking for unlocked doors and gullible communities that they can exploit. This process of exploitation is simplified if a congregation has already been groomed by a past abuser. This has to stop!3. To show that it\u2019s just not that hard.Again and again, we\u2019ve been told that the Southern Baptist Convention takes this issue seriously. But if you take something seriously, it causes you to ACT. Pioneers of abuse within religious organizations have been calling for action for many many years. It\u2019s time for someone to stand up and say \u201CENOUGH\u201D and to ACT. The Southern Baptist Convention has had more than enough time to ACT by creating a database that tracks abusers and enablers within its ranks. To their shame, the Southern Baptist Convention has still not done so. This site is a testimony that it really is not that hard to ACT. It only takes one single person to stand up for what is right. The lives of children and congregations are at stake here. Will you ACT?________________Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:\u2013 preacherboysdoc.com\u2013 https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\u2013 https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc\u2013 https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community who share the Eric Skwarczynski and the Preacher Boys Podcast mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

His awareness campaigns have been featured on MLK50, CNN, Good Morning America, TVONE, Creative Mornings, USA Today, NBC, AJC, Black Enterprise, Rolling Out, Upworthy, and have been viewed by millions of people worldwide.In 2018, Terence led the March Against Poverty as he walked from Atlanta to Memphis (386 miles). He finished the march and spoke at the historic Lorraine Motel for the 50th Anniversary of MLK\u0027s assassination.He has spoken on the same platform as other civil rights activists: Bernice King, Roland Martin, Gina Belafonte, Michael Eric Dyson, Tamika D. Mallory, and many others. Terence\u0027s unique approach combines storytelling and digital media to help illustrate social justice issues with practical approaches to solving these ailments.In 2013, Terence founded the non-profit \u0022Love Beyond Walls\u0022 and has helped hundreds of individuals experiencing homelessness and poverty to rebuild their lives. In 2019, Terence launched the first museum in the U.S. representing homelessness out of a shipping container called Dignity Museum.Terence has written six books, and his new book, \u0022When We Stand: The Power Of Seeking Justice Together,\u0022 released May 18, 2021, with InterVarsity Press. He also holds four degrees and is working towards his Ph.D. at Union Institute \u0026 University in Public Policy \u0026 Social Change.He is happily married to his best friend, Cecilia Lester, and they have two amazing children, Zion Joy and Terence II.ABOUT THE BOOK: It\u0027s easy to feel overwhelmed by all of the injustices that we see in the world. We don\u0027t know what to do and might think that we don\u0027t have anything to offer. But by using our gifts in collaboration with others, we can do more together than we ever could on our own. Activist Terence Lester knows it\u0027s hard to change the world. But mobilizing and acting together empowers us to do what we can\u0027t do as isolated individuals. Lester looks at the obstacles that prevent us from getting involved, and he offers practical ways that we can accomplish things together as groups, families, churches, and communities. He helps us find our place in the larger picture, discerning the unique ways we can contribute and make a difference. By connecting with our neighbors and discovering our own paths of service, we can drastically change how we follow Christ and see God moving in the world. Togetherness and community give visible testimony of the power of the gospel. In this broken world, the body of Christ can transform society\u2015when we stand together.\uFEFF________________Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:\u2013 preacherboysdoc.com\u2013 https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\u2013 https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc\u2013 https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community who share the Eric Skwarczynski and the Preacher Boys Podcast mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

His father, a respected minister in the community, was a predator who used his role behind the pulpit to secretly molest and abuse countless victims. Turning his father over to the police, Jimmy became a tireless advocate and voice for the victims. His pursuit of justice would eventually result in his father\u0027s confession and subsequent conviction.\n\nHaunted by the discovery of his father\u0027s grotesque acts against children, Jimmy, also a pastor, worked to restore the very church where his dad had perpetrated such sickening acts. He was determined to protect others and nurture an environment of healing in the aftermath of abuse. Today he relentlessly studies and exposes the deception techniques that predators like his father used to molest, harm, abuse, and terrorize children. \n\nFind more stories regarding IFB abuse by visiting:\npreacherboysdoc.com\nhttps://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc\nhttps://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc\nhttps://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/\n\nTo connect with a community who share the Preacher Boys Podcast mission to expose abuse in the Independent Fundamental Baptist Movement, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/",

That\u2019s wonderful. Be simple to things that are evil.\u201DInstead, why don\u2019t you - as a leader - ask parents to speak to their children?Why don\u2019t you give out the detective\u2019s phone number so everyone knows who to go to?This man had access to children in Sunday school classrooms and on bus routes for two decades - parents NEED to know that something could have happened and when.Lastly, \u201CGod has helped us do the right thing time after time.\u201D Why are there two negligence lawsuits against FBC Hammond in regards to child sexual abuse currently?_______________________________________________________Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:preacherboysdoc.comhttps://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdochttps://twitter.com/preacherboysdochttps://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community who share the Preacher Boys Podcast mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

Through listening to their stories, Meghan started to notice a pattern that pointed to systems of injustice that held women back\u2014systems that her childhood church had taught and in which she was complicit.She was changed.Returning to the United States, Meghan became keenly aware of how the teachings and messaging surrounding women in her own upbringing were part of the problem. In the process, she began to find her voice, one that spoke out against injustice and moved her into tension with her Christian community.Women Rising is Meghan Tschanz\u0027s personal journey of transformation. But it\u0027s also a Christian blueprint for anyone wanting to confront injustice against women while pointing to a biblical standard for gender equality. With humility and grit, Meghan calls Christian women to amplify their voices for righteousness\u2014and she calls the church to listen._______________________________________________________Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:preacherboysdoc.comhttps://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdochttps://twitter.com/preacherboysdochttps://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community who share the Preacher Boys Podcast mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

      "description": "Support the Show:https://www.patreon.com/preacherboys Purchase a Preacher Boys shirt, mask, sticker, or other merch to rep the show! https://www.teepublic.com/user/preacher-boys-podcast_______________________________________________________Purchase a copy of Recovering From Biblical Manhood \u0026 Womanhood here: https://amzn.to/3eVnswz\u200B_______________________________________________________While evangelical Christianity dukes it out about who can be church leaders, the rest of the 98% of us need to be well equipped to see where we fit in God\u0027s household and why that matters. Recovering from Biblical Manhood and Womanhood is a resource to help church leaders improve the culture of their church and disciple men and women in their flock to read, understand, and apply Scripture to our lives in the church. Until both men and women grow in their understanding of their relationship to Scripture, there will continue to be tension between the sexes in the church. Church leaders need to be engaged in a thoughtful critique of the biblical manhood and womanhood movement and the effects it has on their congregation.Do men and women benefit equally from God\u0027s word? Are they equally responsible for sharpening one another in the faith and passing it down to the next generation? While radical feminism claims that the Bible is a hopelessly patriarchal construction by powerful men that oppresses women, evangelical churches simply reinforce this teaching when we constantly separate men and women, customizing women\u0027s resources and studies according to a culturally based understanding of roles. Do we need men\u0027s Bibles and women\u0027s Bibles, or can the one, holy Bible guide us all? Is the Bible, God\u0027s word, so male-centered and authored that women need to create their own resources to relate to it? No! And in it, we also learn from women. Women play an active role as witnesses to the faith, passing it on to the new generations.This book by Aimee Byrd explores the feminine voice in Scripture as synergistic with the dominant male voice. Through the women, we often get the story behind the story--take Ruth for example, or the birth of Christ through the perspective of Mary and Elizabeth in Luke. Aimee fortifies churches in a biblical understanding of brotherhood and sisterhood in God\u0027s household and the necessity of learning from one another in studying God\u0027s word.The troubling teaching under the rubric of \u0022biblical manhood and womanhood\u0022 has thrived with the help of popular Biblicist interpretive methods. And Biblicist interpretive methods ironically flourish in our individualistic culture that works against the \u0022traditional values\u0022 of family and community that the biblical womanhood and manhood movement is trying to uphold. This book helps to correct Biblicist trends in the church today, affirming that we do not read God\u0027s word alone, we read it within our interpretive covenant communities--our churches. Our relationship with God\u0027s word affects our relationship with God\u0027s people, and vice versa. The church is the school of Christ, commissioned to discipleship. The responsibility of every believer, men, and women together, is being active and equal participants in and witnesses to the faith--the tradents of faith._______________________________________________________Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:preacherboysdoc.comhttps://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdochttps://twitter.com/preacherboysdochttps://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community who share the Preacher Boys Podcast mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

She is also a well-established voice-over artist for popular series such as Transformers: Cybertron and My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic. In 2005, when NXIVM, a personal and professional development company, promised to provide the tools and insight Sarah needed to reach her potential, she was intrigued. Over her twelve-year tenure, she went from student to coach and eventually operated her own NXIVM center in Vancouver. Questions kept coming up about the organization\u2019s rules and practices, which came to a head in 2017 when she accepted an invitation from her best friend to join DOS, a \u201Csecret sisterhood\u201D within NXIVM.In 2019, Sarah published Scarred: The True Story of How I Escaped NXIVM, the Cult that Bound My Life, with Kristine Gasbarre. In this tell-all memoir, she shares her story from the moment she takes her first seminar to her harrowing fight to get out. Her full story as a whistleblower is featured in the CBC podcast Uncover: Escaping NXIVM (downloaded over 25 million times) and The Vow, the critically acclaimed HBO documentary series on NXIVM. Now with the launch of \u201CA Little Bit Culty,\u201D Sarah and her co-host/husband Anthony \u201CNippy\u201D Ames are keeping the conversation going by discussing the healing process with the help of experts and fellow survivors.ABOUT NIPPY:As an aspiring actor and former college athlete, Anthony \u201CNippy\u201D Ames was drawn to NXIVM\u2019s goals program. In his 12 years with the organization, he rose steadily up the ranks as a teacher, built centers in New York and Vancouver, and even met his now-wife, \u201CA Little Bit Culty\u201D co-host, Sarah Edmondson, there. But when he learned that the company was, in fact, a dangerous cult, he wasted no time in doing exactly what needed to be done: helping burn its carefully constructed public image to the ground.With NXIVM\u2019s notorious founder now behind bars facing a brisk 120-year sentence, Nippy isn\u2019t planning on going quiet anytime soon. As Executive Producer of the \u201CA Little Bit Culty\u201D podcast, Nippy has come full circle back to what he was born to do: performing, creating, and truth-telling. He\u2019s proving to be an emerging voice in the conversation around what it means to be an upstanding man, husband, and father in 2021.________________________________________________________Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:preacherboysdoc.comhttps://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdochttps://twitter.com/preacherboysdochttps://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community who share the Preacher Boys Podcast mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

She accepted Christ as her savior at the age of 10 during a week-long summer camp. Like any young girl, she had many dreams. She wanted to marry my prince charming and move to Prince Edward Island and live there in a cottage on the beach with dozens of horses. Life seemed perfect.But at the innocent age of 11, life took a drastic change. All that was safe and familiar to Emily was ripped away. Her family left their church and was soon thereafter torn apart. She quickly learned that her parent\u0027s marriage, which growing up appeared fine on the outside, was indeed incredibly unhealthy, and she came to the shattering realization that her mother had only been trying to keep things together for the sake of her and my sister. The dam finally broke and the true nature of Emily\u0027s father came out in full force. Over the next decade, she would have to suffer and endure abuse on many levels from his hands. The stress of it all caused her to develop an incurable and embarrassing illness called Crohn\u2019s disease when she was just 13 years old. With this new diagnosis, all the picturesque dreams became a distant memory. From that point on, Emily\u0027s mission in life was simply to try to stay alive.To give her a better education, Emily\u0027s mother started homeschooling her in 5th grade, and soon after they decided to join an internationally known \u201CChristian homeschooling group\u201D. She wouldn\u2019t discover until over a decade later that this religious \u201Cgroup\u201D was actually a Fundamentalist Patriarchal Christian Cult...Read more from Emily by visiting thrivingforwardblog.com.Resources mentioned:When the Body Keeps the Score \u2013\u00A0https://amzn.to/2O5vacpRecovering Grace \u2013\u00A0https://www.recoveringgrace.org/________________________________________________________Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:preacherboysdoc.comhttps://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdochttps://twitter.com/preacherboysdochttps://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community who share the Preacher Boys Podcast mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

Because, like men, they are created in His image, their lives reflect and declare His worth.\u00A0Worthy\u00A0will enable and encourage both men and women to embrace this true and lofty vision of God\u0027s creation, plan, and their value in His eyes.Bestselling author Elyse Fitzpatrick and pastor Eric Schumacher together invite women to embrace a transformative and empowering view of their Maker, themselves, and the church.\u00A0But this isn\u0027t only a book for women.\u00A0It is also a book for men, especially leaders, who want to grow in their understanding of God\u0027s perspective on women, people who normally make up the majority of their congregations; men who might be wondering if they\u0027ve missed something amid the abuse scandals that are rocking the church. Might the headlines they\u0027re reading today about abuse have their roots in a denigration of the value and worth of women?\u00A0Worthy: Celebrating the Value of Women\u00A0will help every reader see the value, place, and calling of women through study questions and a \u0022Digging Deeper\u0022 section that will help men and women discover how to cherish, value, and honor one another for God\u0027s glory.Pick up a copy of Worthy here: https://amzn.to/3bZTkwKFind more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:preacherboysdoc.comhttps://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdochttps://twitter.com/preacherboysdochttps://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community who share the Preacher Boys Podcast mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

We\u0027ve seen the news stories and heard the rumors. Maybe we ourselves have been hurt by a narcissistic church leader. It\u0027s easy to throw the term around and diagnose others from afar. But what is narcissism, really? And how does it infiltrate the church? Chuck DeGroat has been counseling pastors with Narcissistic Personality Disorder, as well as those wounded by narcissistic leaders and systems, for over twenty years. He knows firsthand the devastation narcissism leaves in its wake and how insidious and painful it is. In When Narcissism Comes to Church, DeGroat takes a close look at narcissism, not only in ministry leaders but also in church systems. He offers compassion and hope for those affected by its destructive power and imparts wise counsel for churches looking to heal from its systemic effects. DeGroat also offers hope for narcissists themselves\u2015not by any shortcut, but by the long, slow road of genuine recovery, possible only through repentance and trust in the humble gospel of Jesus\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:preacherboysdoc.comhttps://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdochttps://twitter.com/preacherboysdochttps://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community who share the Preacher Boys Podcast mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

Yet like many women today who are taking action against sexual harassment and sexual assault, it is. Bluhm explores the complex dynamics of power and abuse in systems we all find ourselves in. With honesty and strength, she tells stories of how women have overcome silence to expose the truth about their ministry and professional leaders--and the backlash they so often face. In so doing, she empowers others to speak up against abuses of power.Addressing men and women in all work settings--within the church and beyond--popular author and podcast host Tiffany Bluhm sets out to understand the cultural and spiritual narratives that silence women and to illuminate the devastating emotional, financial, and social impact of silence in the face of injustice.As readers journey with Bluhm, they will be moved to find their own way, their own voice, and their own conviction for standing with women. They\u0027ll emerge more ready than ever to advocate for justice, healing, and resurrection.\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:preacherboysdoc.comhttps://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdochttps://twitter.com/preacherboysdochttps://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community who share the Preacher Boys Podcast mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

And Ravi sat atop that organization as a beaming example of how to engage skeptics with thoughtful, considered answers to some of the toughest theological and spiritual questions.\n\nThis is why this fallout and subsequent investigation has been so horrendous for us to discover over these last several months because it shatters the trust and confidence we had in Zacharias and RZIM as authoritative figures in Christianity.\n\nThis is why it is so important that we learn what we can from this awful situation in hopes that we may prevent these sort of abuses from happening under our watch.\n\nIn this video I walk through the findings from the independent investigation into RZIM and the actions of Ravi Zacharias and we draw out three vitally important lessons we can learn as pastors and church leaders.\n\nChristianity Today article: https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2021/february/ravi-zacharias-rzim-investigation-sexual-abuse-sexting-rape.html\n\n12-Page Doc Released by Investigative Body: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/rzimmedia.rzim.org/assets/downloads/Report-of-Investigation.pdf\n\nStatement by RZIM: https://www.rzim.org/read/rzim-updates/theological-statement\n\nGrab your FREE 21-Day Guide to Creating Killer Sermons: https://preachingdonkey.com/21days\n\n\n\n*******************************\nMY BOOKS:\n\nPreaching Killer Sermons by Lane Sebring: \nhttps://amzn.to/2XS3zit\n\nBecome a Preaching Ninja by Lane Sebring: \nhttps://amzn.to/2Y84pXX\n\n\n*******************************\nMY RECORDING GEAR:\n\nCamera - Canon T7i: https://amzn.to/2WsiG00\nTripod - Victiv 72\u0022: https://amzn.to/2WKUGE8\nMicrophone - Blue Yeti: https://amzn.to/2WslJ8e\nSecondary Microphone - Rode VideoMicGo: https://amzn.to/2WqXXJJ\nLighting - Fovitec Softboxes (2): https://amzn.to/2zxBH82\nSecondary Lighting - Neewer CN 160s:https://amzn.to/3fMsXLR\n\n\n*******************************\nFOLLOW ME:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/preachingdonkey\nWebsite: https://www.preachingdonkey.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/preachingdonkey\n\n\n*******************************\nDISCLAIMER:\n\n**This description contains affiliate links as part of the Amazon Associates Program which means if you click through and make a purchase I get a small commission.

      "description": "Ravi Zacharias Victim Posts Victim Impact Statement\n\nLori Anne Thompson, the most well-known and public of Ravi Zacharias\u2019 victims has posted a detailed victim impact statement on her website, detailing the ways that the late-Christian apologist\u2019s sexual predations destroyed her world and adversely affected her and her family for years. It also details the emotional toll that having Ravi Zacharias International Ministries (RZIM) repeatedly publicly lie about her has had, even as they publicly insist they\u2019ve committed no wrongdoing.\n\nThe release of the statement comes on the heels of RZIM confirming they have no intention of releasing her from a non-disclosure/non-disparagement agreement she signed years ago. This continues a long-standing pattern from RZIM of silencing, victim-blaming, and ignoring her wherever possible. It also comes in the light of the knowledge that the big, allegedly \u201Call-encompassing,\u201D and \u201Cindependent\u201D investigation into Ravi Zacharias will not include her, despite being the catalyst for exposing his abuses and the public face of his victims.\n\nShe writes in part:\n\nI tried to tell a Christian counsellor what was happening to me. He told me not to tell anyone, especially not my husband, that he could see RZ\u2019s draw to me, and that if anyone ever found out, the kingdom of God would be irreparably damaged. I became suicidal. When I heard news of someone in our old church getting a diagnosis of terminal cancer, I longed to be her. We visited Peggy\u2019s Cove in Nova Scotia for my fortieth birthday and I researched how best to slip off the rocks and succumb to the deep\u2014such was the depths of my despair. It was not just what was happening to me, but whom it was happening by.\n\nand\n\nI was contacted by text, email, and phone from RZ once I had sent a final email to him. He threatened to commit suicide if I broke my silence. I was terrified in that moment and for a long time to come. To my betrayer, telling anyone was betrayal. Abusers not only demand silence\u2014they enforce it.\n\nWhen I disclosed that same day to my husband what happened to me\u2014he was devastated. Brad had already experienced a protracted history of breach of trust, early abandonment, shaming, and interrupted attachments in his own life. He was crumbling at home with our children and I was in another country in complete collapse. He wasn\u2019t sure he wanted me to come home. I wasn\u2019t sure I would make it home. No one slept that Saturday night and for many years of Saturdays to come. Life as we knew it was ripped apart. We were torn asunder. I can hardly find the words to describe the complete and utter relational, emotional, psychological, and physical implosion.\n\nYou can read the letter in its entirety here, as well as watch the video below. #RaviZacharias #RZIM #Scandal \n\nhttps://protestia.com/2021/02/09/ravi-zacharias-victim-posts-victim-impact-statement/\n\n#RaviZacharias #LoriAnneThompson #SexScandal #BlackBerryMessenger #BBM #Mobile #Scandals  #RZIM #JesusChrist #Bible #Christianity #Trinity #Philosophy #Theology #Islam @MuslimByChoice\u200B",

      "description": "A recent report came out, along with a statement from the RZIM board, detailing multiple abuse victims of Ravi Zacharias. The board issued an apology for not believing allegations that were brought by Lori Ann Thompson in 2017. Though the board issued an apology, where were they 3 years ago when multiple advocates were warning them (with evidence) that Zacharias was a manipulative abuser who also falsified his credentials to secure book and speaking deals? \n\nMr. Zacharias was upheld as a righteous man, and had the full backing of his board even when multiple credible allegations of abuse were brought to them. This made Zacharias feel invincible, and the report shows that he continued abusing women until the time of his death. They uncovered hundreds of images and videos from his phone and one victim alleges that she was raped by Zacharias. \n\nHad the board believed victims, they could have stopped a dangerous predator from harming so many innocent women. \n\nChristianity Today article: https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2021/february/ravi-zacharias-rzim-investigation-sexual-abuse-sexting-rape.html\n\nRZIM statement: https://www.rzim.org/read/rzim-updates/board-statement\n\nIntro--\n Film Glitch by Snowflake (c) copyright 2017 Licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial  (3.0) license. http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/snowflake/56350 Ft: reusenoise\n\nOutro--\n I Have Often Told You Stories (guitar instrumental) by Ivan Chew (c) copyright 2013 Licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution (3.0) license. http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/ramblinglibrarian/41284",

In the 1970s, she founded a rape crisis center and, in the early 1980s, represented battered women in divorce proceedings. She also litigated sex discrimination cases, including helping to articulate the legal concept that made sexual harassment illegal in the 1990s.Her passion and enthusiasm for this work became more personal and immediate with the violent death of her niece Maggie, killed by her ex-boyfriend in 1999. Driven by a desire to help women move on after abuse as Maggie could not, Susan developed and has facilitated since 2001 her\u00A0My Avenging Angel WorkshopsTM, based on the idea that \u201Cliving well is the best revenge.\u201D These workshops have\u00A0helped hundreds of women take the journey from victim to survivor to thriver.Susan\u2019s award-winning work has been described as \u201Clife-changing\u201D and as \u201Ca component for women recovering from abuse that has been virtually overlooked.\u201D On her own healing journey after the senseless death of her niece, Susan found the work she was born to do and it\u00A0comes together here in the THRIVER ZONE \u2014 a healing place for women who want to reclaim their lives after abuse.Susan\u2019s three books in\u00A0The Thriver Zone SeriesTM\u00A0contain the motivational guidance she has successfully used with women in her workshops.

His father, a respected minister in the community, was a predator who used his role behind the pulpit to secretly molest and abuse countless victims. Turning his father over to the police, Jimmy became a tireless advocate and voice for the victims. His pursuit of justice would eventually result in his father\u0027s confession and subsequent conviction.Haunted by the discovery of his father\u0027s grotesque acts against children, Jimmy, also a pastor, worked to restore the very church where his dad had perpetrated such sickening acts. He was determined to protect others and nurture an environment of healing in the aftermath of abuse. Today he relentlessly studies and exposes the deception techniques that predators like his father used to molest, harm, abuse, and terrorize children.

The author of seven books, including How Big Is Your Umbrella, Sheila mixes humor and real-life stories to help women deal with the messy problems many of us face. She is the 2012 winner of the top literary prize for Canadian Christian books for The Good Girl\u2019s Guide to Great Sex, and her blog, To Love, Honor and Vacuum, is one of the top 25 Mom blogs on the web.Growing up the only child of a single mother, she learned two things quickly: God is close to those who are lonely, and marriage is a sacred thing. The void that she felt in her early life has been transformed into a passion to help women find their worth first in Christ, and then to make their relationships mirror His. With her trademark humour and light touch, Sheila is able to drive home scriptural truths in a challenging yet inviting way.Shortly after moving to Belleville, Ontario, when her girls were young, Sheila began writing for magazines. In 2003, her first book, To Love, Honor and Vacuum was published, followed rapidly by several more. She began to speak all over North America, keynoting at national denominational events, such as the Coffee Break conference and the Baptist Women\u2019s convention, and leading workshops at large conferences like the MOPS convention and at BreakForth. She also speaks at women\u2019s outreaches and retreats, sharing her story of finding God even in the darkest times. These don\u2019t just include rejection as a child, but also walking through the horrible valley of losing a son. Through it all, Sheila learned that God is enough, a message she desperately wants other women to cling to and understand.Sheila\u2019s background includes two Master\u2019s degrees from Queen\u2019s University, with one in Sociology and the other in Public Administration. Her real education, though, has come as she has learned to be a wife to Keith, a busy pediatrician, and mother to Rebecca and Katie. Sheila and Keith love homeschooling their children, taking them on mission trips, and building a strong family rooted in Christ. Sheila is one of the few people in her immediate family who is not actually a physician, so she spends her life in doctor circles, on medical missions trips, and medical conferences. But she still faints at the sight of blood.And she knits. Even in line at the grocery store.Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

Respected author and theologian Scot McKnight and former Willow Creek member Laura Barringer wrote this book to paint a pathway forward for the church.We need a better way. The sad truth is that churches of all shapes and sizes are susceptible to abuses of power, sexual abuse, and spiritual abuse. Abuses occur most frequently when Christians neglect to create a culture that resists abuse and promotes healing, safety, and spiritual growth.How do we keep these devastating events from repeating themselves? We need a map to get us from where we are today to where we ought to be as the body of Christ. That map is in a mysterious and beautiful little Hebrew word in Scripture that we translate \u201Cgood,\u201D the word tov.In this book, McKnight and Barringer explore the concept of tov\u2015unpacking its richness and how it can help Christians and churches rise up to fulfill their true calling as imitators of Jesus.----------------------About Scot McKnight:Dr. Scot McKnight is a world-renowned speaker, writer, professor and equipper of the Church.

      "description": "Purchase a copy of \u0022#MeToo: The Reckoning\u0022: https://amzn.to/36285NkRuth Everhart writes memoir -- some with spiritual themes, others about travel. If you dare to believe that Jesus values the lives of women, you will enjoy RUINED and THE #METOO RECKONING (paperback, ebook, and audio). If you crave travel during these pandemic days, try CHASING THE DIVINE IN THE HOLY LAND (paperback, ebookl) or GRAND CANYON BY MULE (Kindle only). Reach out to Ruth at her website, www.rutheverhart.com.\u2605 Publishers Weekly starred review. The #MeToo movement has revealed sexual abuse and assault in every sphere of society, including the church. But victims are routinely ignored by fellow Christians who deny their accounts and fail to bring accountability to the perpetrators. All too often, churches have been complicit in protecting abusers, reinforcing patriarchal power dynamics, and creating cultures of secrecy, shame, and silence. Pastor and survivor Ruth Everhart shines a light on the prevalence of sexual abuse and misconduct within faith communities. She candidly discloses stories of how she and others have experienced assault in church settings, highlighting the damage done to individuals, families, and communities. Everhart offers hope to survivors as she declares that God is present with the violated and stands in solidarity with victims. Scriptural narratives like those of Tamar and Bathsheba carry powerful resonance in today\u0027s context, as do the accounts of Jesus\u0027 interactions with women. God is at work in the midst of this #MeToo moment to call the church to repentance and deliver us from violence against the vulnerable.\uFEFFFind more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:\u2013 preacherboysdoc.com\u2013 https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/\u2013 https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc\u2013 https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community who share the Preacher Boys Podcast mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/Support the Show:https://www.patreon.com/preacherboysSupport this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

Only by telling our stories; only by talking about these issues without shame, without hesitation, and without pause, only then will we create a society where those who struggle to feel comfortable speaking out. The podcast is published weekly, on Friday mornings, with the occasional special episode on Mondays. Each episode features me chatting with an incredibly knowledgeable person on one of these topics. Or at least something in relation to one of these topics! Past guests include former Congressmember Katie Hill, Comedian Frank King, The Addiction Doctor Robb Kelly, Ultramarathoner Greg Nance, and many others. The first season of the Choose Your Struggle Podcast closed in November. This season saw the podcast break into the top 200 Health and Wellness list on Apple and was streamed in more than thirty countries. Over 40% of listens this season came from outside the US.Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:preacherboysdoc.comhttps://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdochttps://twitter.com/preacherboysdochttps://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community who share the Preacher Boys Podcast mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

Since 2015, Steve has been investigating famed apologist, Ravi Zacharias, keeping tabs on the growing number of scandals surrounding him.\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013Steve\u0027s Bio:My name is Steve Baughman.I am a part-time lawyer, part-time touring and teaching musician, part-time philosophy student, and full-time dilettante. I am currently registered at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley and have done most of my work there with the Dominicans.I am a religious skeptic but I consider it intellectual cowardice to enroll in schools and programs whose stated purpose is to strengthen your existing religious beliefs.In my legal practice, I represent Chinese nationals seeking political asylum in the United States. Most of my clients are Christians and Uyghur Muslims fleeing persecution in China.My educational background is as follows:University of California at Santa Barbara: BA (History) 1984. Thesis: Canonization of the New Testament.University of California at Berkeley: MA (Asian Studies) 1987. Thesis: Can\u2019t recall exactly, but something fairly broad on Chinese socialist law.Santa Clara University: Juris Doctor 1990Around 2010 I was enrolled in the San Francisco State University Philosophy MA, where I took two graduate seminars in the philosophy of science, one graduate seminar in meta-ethics, and several undergraduate courses.The Ravi Zacharias project fell into my lap most unexpectedly in 2015 when I was seeking the best and brightest defenders of the Christian religion. I began earnestly to look into his work and quickly found a scoundrel behind the smiling erudition.People have warned me that Ravi will sue me for the work I have done exposing his career-long deceptions and misconduct. He won\u2019t. Despite his public persona, Ravi Zacharias is a cowardly man who refuses to debate opponents, daring only to confront them from behind his keyboard or microphone, where he controls the agenda. A lawsuit against me would require Ravi to sit down for a deposition and answer questions without evasion.Institutional Christianity has responded to the (growing!) mountain of evidence against Ravi Zacharias by sweeping it under the rug. Ravi continues to receive speaking gigs and awards from churches and evangelical groups as well as book contracts from Christian publishers.This is exactly what my atheist worldview would have predicted.For more on my life see www.CelticGuitar.com.I am most easily reached by email at zenbanjo@gmail.comSteve BaughmanDecember 2019\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\uFEFFFind more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:preacherboysdoc.comhttps://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdochttps://twitter.com/preacherboysdochttps://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community who share the Preacher Boys Podcast mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

Victor calmly reminded his victim, Rachel Peach, that \u0022preacher won\u0027t do anything.\u0022\n\nBut refusing to report abuse is not some unwritten rule at Faith Baptist Church. It is literally a written one.\n\nIn January 2020, a former member and victim of abuse from Faith Baptist Wildomar shared the church\u0027s three-page \u0022Whistle-blower Policy.\u0022\n\nThe instructions are crystal clear: \n\u0022A supervisor who becomes aware of suspected misconduct should not report the case to an authorized law enforcement officer without first discussing the case with the Pastor, appointed Deacon, Staff Member, or Female Reporter.\u0022\n\nIn this episode, Kathy Durbin shares her story of abuse at the hands of Paul Fox, and the cover-up that ensued.\n\nFind more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:\npreacherboysdoc.com\nhttps://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc\nhttps://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc\nhttps://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/\n\nTo connect with a community who share the Preacher Boys Podcast mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/ \n\n\nmoreno valley california",

      "description": "Start with your 14-day FREE trial of Shape \u0026 Foster by clicking here: https://bit.ly/2W1oz2RAt the beginning of 2020, I was about 250 pounds. I was unhealthy. I was sitting at my desk, I was eating junk food. I was chugging a sugary soda and like three cans of red bull a day. And I was just not in a good place. Add onto that, starting a podcast and moving locations and, uh, taking on a new business venture, and then COVID hit.And, uh, my business lost, like I said, I lost about 75% of that income. Uh, we had just moved to a place where our expenses were significantly higher. Uh, on top of that, I was processing trauma and things that I had experienced in my own life. I was dealing with the weight of this podcast, which deals with some very heavy topics.So I was in a very bad spot. I lost about 20 pounds just from stress. And, uh, it was down to two 35. Um, and even though I was excited, I was losing the weight and looking better. Um, just I mentally was not healthy. I was not in a good place mentally, physically, emotionally and financially. And, uh, one of the things that I started to address was, you know, my mindset and so.I was able to get connected with a program called 75 hard. Uh, it\u0027s a totally free program. It\u0027s just a, basically a fitness challenge. I did it with a buddy of mine, Travis Chappell, who hosts the build your network podcast. And, uh, it was just a really, really great opportunity to get to sit down and, um, you know, really plan out how it\u0027s gonna improve my body.So 75 hard challenge before I get into the app, uh, basically means you work out twice a day. You do 45 minutes. Um, Yeah, inside 45 minutes outside, you do a gallon of water a day, 15 minutes of reading a day, and you do a no cheat meals and you have to maintain a diet and no alcohol. Um, and so I did that for 75 days, uh, lost down to 205 pounds.So I\u0027ve really lost about 45 pounds in the spring of this year. 25 of that was healthy. 25 of that was unhealthy. And, um, it\u0027s just been a really awesome thing. And. Coming into, uh, the end of 75 hard. I really was wondering how I was going to stay focused on my fitness, my finances, my health, my mental health, um, how I was going to improve those areas of my life and not, not just improve them, but just keep this consistency and these good positive habits.And, uh, in my conversations with therapists and with people who are experts that have come on the show, I\u0027ve really understood the importance of kind of really healthy patterns in my life. And that\u0027s where shape and foster really came in clutch for me, uh, basically. Uh, shape and foster is like a social media platform or mastermind where you get to connect with other people who are focused on mental, physical, and, uh, just healthy lifestyle choices.And, uh, there\u0027s five experts involved with the program who have created 12 months. Programs inside of shape and foster, uh, or courses, if you want to call it that. And, uh, they lean into having a healthy heart, mind, lifestyle, financial planning, all of that good stuff. And there\u0027s like two to three hours of video content every single month that you get to go through.And on top of that, I meant, I said there were five experts. There\u0027s actually six, there\u0027s a yoga instructor who provides online classes through zoom. So it\u0027s really, really cool. And it\u0027s just a really, really cool program. I was able to post in there right at the tail end of my 75 Hard about my achievement.And it was amazing. Like they, it\u0027s not like a like on Facebook it\u0027s \u2013 they call it a cheer \u2013 but I had all these people that I didn\u0027t know who were in the same kind of area in the same place of personal development that were literally cheering me on, uh, it\u0027s called the cheer when someone likes one of your posts.It was just really, really encouraging, getting to read articles, getting to see stuff from the founder of the company and kind of his goals. I just have really appreciated the opportunity to use this app. And I\u0027ve encouraged you guys to try it out. They have a 14-day trial that you can kind of test drive, uh, this program and see if it\u0027s a good fit for you conquering your 2021 fitness goals.Again, I think with so many of you who are connected with this podcast or in the group, or subscribe to the YouTube channel, wherever you\u0027re consuming this content, this program would probably be great for you. Uh, I, I think there\u0027s so many of us that, that just get so focused on surviving that we forget to do things that will help us to thrive.And, uh, she\u0027d been foster will do just that for you. It\u0027s going to help you thrive. It\u0027s going to help you really pick up momentum, get connected with like-minded people who are really focused on positive, good energy. And, uh, I think it\u0027s going to be just totally awesome. And I really encourage you just head over to the link in the description of this video and take it for a test drive it yourself.Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:preacherboysdoc.comhttps://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdochttps://twitter.com/preacherboysdochttps://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community who share the Preacher Boys Podcast mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

Evangelical books, films, music, clothing, and merchandise shape the beliefs of millions. And evangelical popular culture is teeming with muscular heroes\u2015mythical warriors and rugged soldiers, men like Oliver North, Ronald Reagan, Mel Gibson, and the Duck Dynasty clan, who assert white masculine power in defense of \u201CChristian America.\u201D Chief among these evangelical legends is John Wayne, an icon of a lost time when men were uncowed by political correctness, unafraid to tell it like it was, and did what needed to be done.Trump, in other words, is hardly the first flashy celebrity to capture evangelicals\u2019 hearts and minds, nor is he the first strongman to promise evangelicals protection and power. Indeed, the values and viewpoints at the heart of white evangelicalism today\u2015patriarchy, authoritarian rule, aggressive foreign policy, fear of Islam, ambivalence toward #MeToo, and opposition to Black Lives Matter and the LGBTQ community\u2015are likely to persist long after Trump leaves office.A much-needed reexamination, Jesus and John Wayne explains why evangelicals have rallied behind the least-Christian president in American history and how they have transformed their faith in the process, with enduring consequences for all of us.Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:preacherboysdoc.comhttps://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdochttps://twitter.com/preacherboysdochttps://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community who share the Preacher Boys Podcast mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

      "description": "From 1991-1992, Laverne Paul Fox, the Bus Ministry Director at Faith Baptist Wildomar, California engaged in sexual relationships with minors, guilting them into silence.Upon discovering this situation, Pastor Bruce Goddard allegedly did not report to authorities but rather ordered Fox to leave the state and the families to stay silent.This story was used as leverage over youth pastor Victor Monterio\u0027s victims from 1998-2013. Victor calmly reminded his victim, Rachel Peach, that \u0022preacher won\u0027t do anything.\u0022But refusing to report abuse is not some unwritten rule at Faith Baptist Church. It is literally a written one.In January 2020, a former member and victim of abuse from Faith Baptist Wildomar shared the church\u0027s three-page \u0022Whistle-blower Policy.\u0022The instructions are crystal clear:\u0022A supervisor who becomes aware of suspected misconduct should not report the case to an authorized law enforcement officer without first discussing the case with the Pastor, appointed Deacon, Staff Member, or Female Reporter.\u0022In this episode, Kathy Durbin shares her story of abuse at the hands of Paul Fox, and the cover-up that ensued.Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:preacherboysdoc.comhttps://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdochttps://twitter.com/preacherboysdochttps://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/To connect with a community who share the Preacher Boys Podcast mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

      "description": "Singer, Songwriter, Empowerment Speaker, and Domestic Violence Advocate, Diana Winkler, states that her directive and mission are strong, but simple: Not just to entertain, but to offer a musical safe haven.\u00A0Her story, behind the lyrics, is one that has led her to embrace individuals who have been trapped in the \u0022behind closed doors\u0022 subject of\u00A0abuse. Diana\u2019s artistic journey began when she was a young child. While growing up, she was involved in various forms of the Arts, which included theatre, choir and dance. Diana felt that she had been created to cultivate these gifts to serve others. When attending Bible College in Fairfax, VA, Diana received formal voice and piano training.\u00A0Her studies also focused on overseas missions and church music. Diana also used her language skills to minister to the Hispanic community.\u00A0It was during this period of time that the vision of a music ministry began to take form within her. Armed with education, experience and an invigorated passion for music, Diana began to make a name for herself within the local music community.\u00A0Diana\u2019s musical expression of classical and traditional church worship music was best known for the blend of a deep, low range and soaring high notes.\u00A0Throughout the upcoming years, she led various worship teams as a lead vocalist, choir director, church pianist, and also used her abilities to teach voice to aspiring students.\u00A0Her skills and passion for local and global ministries enabled her to be part of church planting in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia and Arizona, along with serving in the countries of Puerto Rico and Canada. But all was not well with Diana. She was someone who had become a victim of verbal and emotional abuse.\u00A0She describes her despair, \u0022I felt like I was trapped, and none of the options in front of me were very good ones.\u00A0So, for a long time, I stayed.\u0022\u00A0This kind of darkness was changing Diana from the inside out.\u00A0Her life as a Christian musicianary was beautiful and she blessed many others, yet all the while, the feelings of emptiness, depression and hopelessness in her personal life began to take its toll.\u00A0Diana says, \u201CI woke up one morning more depressed than I have been in my whole life. I could not imagine bearing another year in this prison. I cried out to God, and said, \u0027 I can\u0027t live like this anymore. I am willing to take whatever consequences are for leaving this situation, but I am getting out before it destroys me\u0027.\u201D\u00A0She knew that God had a plan for her life, and held on to that promise.\u00A0Through much prayer and supplication, Diana decided to leave.\u00A0This was one of the hardest, but necessary decisions she had ever made.  Today, having been blessed with her current musician husband, Brian, Diana finds herself in the midst of the ministry that had been part of her early dreams.\u00A0Residing in the Phoenix Metro area, Diana and Brian are writing original songs that have been birthed from her experiences. \u201CThis new project, which includes original songs and cover tunes, is a collection of music to educate, empower and encourage those who are going through and have survived domestic violence, both physical and emotional.\u201D, exclaims Diana. This compilation is a mix of genres from blues, jazz, flamenco and country influences, taking a different direction from her first CD, Classic Favorites. Diana is working to increase awareness of domestic violence within her church and community through public speaking and sharing her music at many churches and local events. \u201CDiana has a willing, sweet heart and a beautiful voice that complements her personality.\u00A0She has been a valuable added member to our arts and worship team here at FBC Scottsdale.\u201D, says Jessie Young, Director of Fine Arts, First Baptist Church, Scottsdale. Diana has recently partnered with Mending The Soul Ministries, a faith-based small group program for those healing from abuse. \u0022This is a top...Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

      "description": "He\u2019s facing 4 simultaneous lawsuits, has had 7 ex-members go to the police over sexual abuse involving minors, but Bruce Goddard is not slowing down! He\u2019s still more than willing to collect your checks. If you\u2019re not familiar with Bruce Goddard, he is the pastor of Faith Baptist Church in Wildomar, CA \u2013 a church that is no stranger to sexual misconduct among its staff. To give you a simple timeline, - In 1991 and 1992\u00A0\u2013 Laverne Paul Fox engages in sexual relationships with minors, guilting them into silence. Upon discovering this situation, Pastor Bruce Goddard allegedly ordered Fox to leave the state. - 1998-2013\u00A0\u2013 Youth Pastor Malo \u201CVictor\u201D Monteiro began sexually preying on three\u00A0teenage girls. Rachel Peach was 15 years old, Lea Ramirez left the church at 15 due to several advances, and April Avila was groomed from the age of 14 and eventually became a victim of sexual abuse. - 2013\u00A0\u2013 Monteiro leaves Faith Baptist Church to start a new church, Menifee Baptist Church. - 2016\u00A0\u2013 Monteiro suddenly leaves Menifee Baptist Church for undisclosed reasons. - 2017\u00A0\u2013 Jerald Arnold Nelson is arrested for possession of child pornography. The church has a history of both allegations and documented evidence of protecting abusers. First, you have Bruce Goddard allegedly failing to report Laverne Paul Fox\u0027s sexual misconduct with minors in 1992 and urging him to leave the state. This story was used as leverage over Victor Montiero\u0027s victims. Victor calmly reminded Rachel Peach that \u0022preacher won\u0027t do anything.\u0022 But refusing to report abuse is not some unwritten rule at Faith Baptist Church. It is literally a written one. In January 2020, a former member and victim of abuse from Faith Baptist Wildomar shared the church\u0027s three-page \u0022Whistle-blower Policy.\u0022 The instructions are crystal clear:\u00A0 \u0022A supervisor who becomes aware of suspected misconduct should\u00A0not report the case to an authorized law enforcement officer\u00A0without first discussing the case with the Pastor, appointed Deacon, Staff Member, or Female Reporter.\u0022 Keep in mind, the pastor is to be UNQUESTIONED which is always an ingredient for disaster in these types of cases. It also doesn\u0027t help that the church borrows teaching liberally from the church known for its abuse scandals \u2013 First Baptist Church of Hammond, Indiana. The church is currently advertising a class for young girls called Blue Denim \u0026 Lace, based on\u00A0a book\u00A0originally developed by the cult leader, adulterer, and defender of abusers, Jack Hyles. With this history, would you really feel compelled to raise $40k dollars to advance this man\u2019s children\u0027s ministry? On top of how tone-deaf a challenge like this really is \u2013\u00A0since COVID has affected the income of many, especially in CA \u2013 an area that is already notoriously expensive, it\u2019s also coming at a time where 4 people are actively suing the church for literally having their childhoods or teen years destroyed by abuse within the ministry in Wildomar \u2013 one wonders why resources aren\u2019t being allocated to help them?

The hashtag \u201Chttps://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23CancelNetflix (#CancelNetflix)\u201D was the No. 1 trending topic on Twitter on Thursday. The reason? Their controversial new film, Cuties. My take: Creating a movie that sexually exploits children to warn about the dangers of sexually exploiting children makes as much sense as making a snuff film to warn about the dangers of murder.

Chris is Adjunct Professor of Bible and Theology at Trinity College of the Bible and Theological Seminary and co-editor of Rethinking Hell: Readings in Evangelical Conditionalism (Cascade, 2014) and A Consuming Passion (Pickwick, 2015). A full-time software engineer, Chris believes theology and apologetics are for every average joe in the pews, and not just for pastors, philosophers, PhD\u2019s and the erudite in ivory towers. Formerly a traditionalist, he became convinced of the biblical view of final punishment over the course of a process which began when he interviewed Edward Fudge, and he has since defended the view in several debates and on Justin Brierley\u0027s Unbelievable? radio program on Premier Christian Radio UK.

      "description": "With a filmography including movies like Untamed Mistress, The Exotic Ones, King of the Bullwhip, Mesa of Lost Women, and Girl from Tobacco Row - Ron Ormond had established himself as a bonafide exploitation and grindhouse filmmaker in Nashville, Tennessee. His signature schlocky style has undeniable charm. With his off-kilter visuals, surprisingly gory set-pieces, and experimental editing choices, the last thing any of his films can be accused of being is boring. The most interesting of his directorial output, however, begins in 1971, when Ormond first partnered with fundamentalist pastor, Estus W. Pirkle, to direct the film, \u201CIf Footmen Tire You, What Will Horses Do?\u201D The film warned about the impending dangers of communism on American families and churches. The second film to come from this unique collaborative team would come in 1974...

After retiring from the RCMP, Dr. Palfy obtained her Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology from the University of Alberta where she conducted her doctoral research on the reasons why males don\u2019t commonly disclose sexual abuse. She is now a trained trauma therapist and public speaker on the topic of male abuse. Dr. Palfy currently runs a small private practice where she works with male survivors of sexual abuse, first responders, victims of bullying and couples. Outside of her professional life she enjoys hiking, cycling, swimming, kayaking, paddle boarding, hanging out with friends and her pets.

      "description": "On this episode, your host, Eric Skwarczynski, is joined by Claire Horner.  Claire Horner is known in Atlanta as ATL Shrink and The Relationship Translator. Therapist and advocate for clients seeking relief from sexual assault and those pursuing healthy relationships.  She is licensed as a Professional Counselor with a dual masters. There has been so much hurt and abuse within the Church, that she thought it best to gain particular education in this area so she pursued a degree in Professional Counseling, but also one that brought psychology and theology together.  Her experience growing up in a fundamentalist religious atmosphere also provides a level of understanding that can assist those healing from doctrines that went too far, contributed to abuse, or were potentially isolating in ways that have made moving into adulthood... complicated. After completing the degrees by early 2004, she became licensed on Valentine\u2019s Day in 2007.  In the past 17 years, she has found providing group therapy, recovery from toxic religious experiences (including abuse and sexual assault), and working with intercultural/interracial couples to be particularly rewarding.  Her work in corrections at the start of her career fueled her passion for assisting all people to raise their awareness of how to better care for themselves, to reduce the stigma of mental illness, and to slow down generational traumas.  As a new endeavor in the summer of 2019, she decided to start the Atlanta Sexual Trauma Specialist Database. The networking community serves as a resource to one another and the community who needs access to a single place to find providers. The services the specialists offer span psychotherapy, psychiatry, alternative medicine, functional medicine, massage, among others, and can also include trauma-informed businesses. As it develops, it is hoped that The STS Database will be a source for speakers to area groups on the topic of sexual trauma \u2013 both on the sides of prevention and healing. (A trauma-informed business may be a salon, tattoo shop, or real estate company that has been trained in practices that would make it easier for a person with Complex PTSD \u2013 for example \u2013 to utilize their services in a minimally triggering atmosphere.)  The STS Database is excited to have been part of a specialist roundtable discussion in the upcoming documentary Unlearning Sex by filmmaker and sexual assault survivor Zahah Thirus. It is being released in educational institutions and will be hitting the film festival circuit starting this fall.  When she\u2019s not tending to her practice, she is likely hunting Greg Mike\u2019s newest graffiti masterpieces in Atlanta with her photographer mate, rewatching Chef\u2019s Table, planning the next Halloween creation, or tackling the technological learning curve of becoming a voiceover artist!  The approach Claire uses in counseling stems from the following belief: \u201CWe are not bits and pieces that work separately, but a compilation of physical body, complex mind, emotional information center, relational motivations (or not), sexual energy, and spiritual glue that bring together these aspects of life. These systems break down during grief, trauma, life transitions, and other experiences that create disturbing symptoms. The therapeutic process seeks to restore the way these aspects work together thereby reducing the symptoms, calming emotional storms, and providing choices for the future.\u201D  Claire Horner: \uFEFFClaire Horner, MS, MS, LPC, is nationally certified and a state licensed professional counselor. For individual, couple, or group counseling, Claire can be reached at ATL Shrink, Inc. by calling 404.277.6631 or via the following: Email: clairehorner@atlantashrink.com Website: http://www.atlantashrink.com IG: atlshrink LinkedIn: Claire Horner, LPC FB: ATL Shrink YouTube: Claire Horner  Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting:...Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/preacher-boys-podcast/donationsAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

She eventually ended up back at the New Beginnings Girls Academy, and, rather than receiving the medical and emotional treatment she needed, was used as an example and treated poorly by the staff, eventually dumped at a bus stop with no information.

Rebecca shares about her experiences at churches at Northern California, Southern California, and Nevada, as well as at Golden State Baptist College in Santa Clara, CA.  Rebecca was sexually assaulted three times in thirty years, with two actively covered up by Hopewell Baptist Church in Napa Valley, CA, and the other by a church in San Diego. When she reached out to her former college president, pastor, and friend Jack Trieber about the third assault, he told her it was innapropriate to discuss and to do whatever her pastor told her to do.  Her pastor \u2013 on the counsel of the Christian Law Association \u2013 ended up firing her for it.

For the interview, Eric is joined by Austin O\u0027Hara.  Austen brings many unique perspectives to the IFB movement. As a transgender male, Austen describes the experience of being a female attending Hyles-Anderson College, the limitations of sex education, the lack of understanding regarding consent, and even what the experience was like when Jack Schaap was arrested.  He also discusses the parallels between attending one of the most notoriously strict IFB colleges and military service as a member of the Air Force, plus so much more.

I was programmed to please him in all that I did but I knew this was not supposed to happen but fell into a sense of shock and repressed the memories as he would use my body for his deviant pleasures and sexual release.\u00A0Grooming a victim for rape is about control, and he knew he had it. He began a years-long sexual abuse of me that further isolated and silenced me. In fact, after the initial abuse incident, I was so traumatized that I completely lost my singing voice. My two-plus octave range was reduced to a scratchy three notes.\u00A0My heart was broken. I saw how expertly he manipulated and raped me. I would only have to imagine that several other victims exist because he clearly knew what he was doing, and he was bold enough to sexually violate his own daughter-in-law. This man knew how to get what he wanted and what he did to me hurt more deeply than I will ever be able to fully express.\u00A0I was now his, and he owned my body to do as he wanted.\u201D \u2013 Becky Calvert https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vx6H3I7Y1PbGZ-1ta-ugzh3u3MVDaWCC/view (Download Becky\u0027s full written statement here): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vx6H3I7Y1PbGZ-1ta-ugzh3u3MVDaWCC/view (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vx6H3I7Y1PbGZ-1ta-ugzh3u3MVDaWCC/view)  Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting: https://open.acast.com/shows/5e123e2b355ab8560d61f99c/episodes/preacherboysdoc.com (preacherboysdoc.com) https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/ (https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/) https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc (https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc) https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/ (https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/)  To connect with a community who share the\u00A0Preacher Boys Podcast\u00A0mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/ (https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/)  Support the Show: https://www.patreon.com/preacherboys (https://www.patreon.com/preacherboys)  See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.

      "description": "\u200BTiffani Cappello spent many years struggling with\u00A0depression and an anxiety disorder that was dominating her life and damaging her health.\u00A0She suffered many traumatic experiences throughout her life, including the death of her own child and 5 years of debilitating chronic illness. As a result, she felt defeated by life and wound\u00A0up believing many things about herself and the world that were disempowering.\u00A0The beliefs she developed in the past were now haunting her future and preventing her from living a happy and healthy life.\u00A0 \u200B Believing she was unlovable and inherently defective took her life in all sorts of painful directions. She got married and subsequently divorced. She spent 15 years in an extreme Independent Fundamental Baptist church that taught her she was born a defective sinner and, as a woman, was inferior and subservient to men. After her divorce she dated men that were addicts and abusers.\u00A0 \u200B\u200B After leaving the religious cult, she realized just how impactful our beliefs can be. Tiffani began to not only question the oppressive religious dogma she had once embraced, but also began to take a good hard look at all of her beliefs. She began a journey of personal development that started with reading self-help books and ended with Rapid Transformational Therapy.  RTT has changed her life and now, as an RTT hypnotherapist and mindset coach, she is able to transform the lives of other people the way her life has been changed. Tiffani now specializes in helping other people who are being held back in life by anxiety and lack of confidence.\u200B  Tiffani Cappello http://www.tiffanicappello.com/ (http://www.tiffanicappello.com/) https://www.facebook.com/tiffani.cappello (https://www.facebook.com/tiffani.cappello) https://www.facebook.com/groups/154924288039752/ (https://www.facebook.com/groups/154924288039752/) https://www.instagram.com/tiffanicappellocoaching/ (https://www.instagram.com/tiffanicappellocoaching/)  Find more stories regarding the IFB movement by visiting: https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/ (https://www.facebook.com/preacherboysdoc/) https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc (https://twitter.com/preacherboysdoc) https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/ (https://www.instagram.com/preacherboysdoc/)  To connect with a community who share the\u00A0Preacher Boys Podcast\u00A0mission to expose abuse in the IFB, join the OFFICIAL Preacher Boys Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/ (https://www.facebook.com/groups/1403898676438188/)  See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.

His father, Ron Williams, was the founder and director of Hephzibah House in Winona Lake In, which also has Believers Baptist Church \u2013 independent church that was started by my father on his own. His father and mother have years of documented abuse that has occurred under them to students in the home, staff children and even church kids \u2013 emotional abuse, spiritual abuse, mental abuse, and even physical abuse. His mother passed away, but her legacy of destruction and hurt lingers on in hundreds of lives that she damaged.

      "description": "On this episode, your host, Eric Skwarczynski, answers some listener questions.  Questions: How do you define fundamentalism? I grew up believing that it just meant the following: divine creator, inerred word of God, His diety (virgin birth, died for us, bodily resurrection), He will come back and establish His kingdom, and there is a literal heaven and hell. Does fundamentalism mean something different to these groups? Why now to create this amazing podcast? If you have left the IFB \u0022Movement\u0022 (whatever that is) why are you singling out the IFB denomination and not addressing abuse within religious institutions as a whole? At face value this appears you just have a personal bone to pick with the IFB denomination when the issue of victims and justice extends far beyond IFB and in fact abuse may be far more prevalent in terms of frequency within other denominations and social groups. Why is there such a thing as \u0022preacher boys?\u0022 At what point was the veil over your eyes lifted and you were able to see the IFB movement for what it was...? Who are some of the most egregious IFB villains? How many are seeing the issues within the IFB span all denominations? All have the same hierarchical, institutional, man-made structure. If that is taken away, what would Christians be left with? What did the disciples have that we don\u0027t? --- a passionate,fearless love for Jesus; wonder working power-- just to name a few. Why did you start this? What\u0027s your personal story?

Wendy\u2019s personal hell began 1984 at First Baptist Church of Easton, when she says Pastor Joe Thompson began trying to sexually groom her and other girls, eventually attempting to force himself upon some of them.  Wendy also saw firsthand the abuse of her mentally handicapped brothers by Pastor Joe Thompson and the Christian School \u2013 starvation, beatings, and verbal abuse.  She now spends her life outside the movement helping others understand their value and encourages them to remove themselves from abusive situations.
