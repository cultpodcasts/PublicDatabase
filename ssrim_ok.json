They are joined by Dr. Deborah Park , a resident psychiatrist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, to explore the intersection of religion, psychiatry, and happiness. Later, they are joined by comedian Matt Durndak to present the side of a skeptic. The conversation touches on belief, unbelief, locus of control, and more.
