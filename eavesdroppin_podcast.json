      "description": "It\u0027s a rough ride on Eavesdroppin\u2019 comedy podcast this week, as Geordie and Michelle look at bad cults\u2026 \n\nIf you were a child with scholastic issues or behavioural problems in the early 1980s in the UK, you might have been sent to a Red House alternative education facility. The brochures told of an idyllic boarding school where children who had suffered abuse or neglect at home could thrive in an environment where sailing and horse riding were interspersed with reading, writing and arithmetic. The reality was that the Red House schools were institutions where children were regularly beaten, humiliated, sexually abused and forced into slave labour. Listen now for Geordie\u0027s deep dive into Red House schools, the Danish founding organisation Tvind and a discussion about why it was a cult hiding in plain sight... \n\nMichelle follows with a look at a harrowing New Zealand cult called Gloriavale. Tucked away on the west coast of New Zealand\u0027s South Island is a religious group that was meant to be a spiritual utopia - the men worked, the women raised kids and everyone lived by the word of god and shared the spoils of communal labour. On paper, Gloriavale sounds like a dream - but it\u0027s a cult, where men are in control and women are trained to submit, serve and stay silent. Who started this cult? How is it off the international radar? And is the cult still going now? Listen to find out.\n\nSo pop on your headphones, grab a brown lemonade and join Geordie \u0026 Michelle for this week\u2019s episode, plus chit-chat about Steiner Schools, Geordie\u0027s celeb Young Ones moment, Michelle\u0027s celeb encounter with a top pop star at LAX, a guardian angel encounter from Eavesdropper Steph, plus a near miss love triangle with a Hollywood A-Lister from Eavesdropper Roxanne and more, only on Eavesdroppin\u2019 podcast.
