      "description": "Is the Transcendental Meditation movement founded by \u201CHis Holiness\u201D Maharishi Mahesh Yogi a cult? There\u0027s been some debate about the use of the word cult. Some say it is overused and imprecise. An expression favoured these days is \u0027\u0027high control organization\u0027\u0027 or \u0027\u0027high demand group\u0027\u0027. A case can be made that many who have gone on further in the TM organisation, becoming teachers and leaders, have been subject to high control, albeit in a subtle form.\n\nSome of the subtler elements of coercive control can be:\n\nan atmosphere where people are trained to gaslight themselves. For example, a situation may have been brought about where if the leadership behaves in puzzling ways, people will nonetheless speculate in their favour. \u201COh, they must have done it for (this) reason.\u201D The concept of \u201Chigher\u201D states of consciousness and the assumption that some leaders have attained them, favours such an atmosphere.\nan atmosphere where once the neophyte has become absorbed into the \u201Cpriesthood\u201D it is gently implied that there is something wrong with them if they engage in critical thinking \u2014 discussion and debate on points of doctrine.\nan atmosphere where those raising even very standard questions about, for example, financial accountability, are disadvantaged. This will be the case, for example, if such questions are characterised as \u201Cdrops of poison.\u0022\nFew would argue that people learning the basic entry level of Transcendental Meditation are subjected to coercive control. However, they have put a foot on the first rung of the ladder, and moving them up the ladder is baked into the \u201CTM\u201D teaching process.\n\nFeatures:\nRachel Bernstein LMFT, MSEd, \u200BHost of IndoctriNation: A weekly podcast covering cults, manipulators, and how to protect yourself from systems of control.
