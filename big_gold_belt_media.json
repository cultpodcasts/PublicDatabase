      "description": "Cult Massacre: One Day in Jonestown review by Big Gold Belt Media\n\n-\nSynopsis:\nThe Emmy\u00AE Award-winning, critically acclaimed franchise ONE DAY IN AMERICA returns with its third installment, CULT MASSACRE: ONE DAY IN JONESTOWN. The three-part series from Emmy Award-winning 72 Films\u2019 David Glover, BAFTA Award-winning director Marian Mohamed, along with Academy Award\u00AE-winning filmmakers Dan Lindsay and T.J. Martin, tells the story of an idealistic religious organization led by the infamous Jim Jones, who set out to establish a utopian community in Guyana. What began as a peaceful movement seeking social justice ultimately spiraled into a mass casualty event that left 918 dead. Told by survivors and eyewitnesses, along with using rare footage and rare Jim Jones recordings, the powerful series gives an immersive look into the final harrowing hours leading up to one of America\u2019s darkest chapters.\n\n\n\nTags\n#CultMassacreOneDayinJonestown #hulu #natgeo\n\n\nThank you for watching our videos here at BGB Media!
