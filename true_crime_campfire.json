      "description": "I have vivid memories of the night of March 22, 1997. Part of it has to do with, y\u2019know, young dumb love\u2014but most of it has to do with the Hale-Bopp Comet, also known as the Great Comet, which was brilliantly visible from my hometown that night. I had a huge crush on this guy, and he invited me to watch the comet with him. We climbed up on the rooftop of this neighborhood bar with a bottle of screw-top wine, and we watched the sky\u2014and suddenly, there it was, a bright silvery ball with a long glowing tail. Magic. I\u2019ll never forget it\u2014wrote some bad poetry about it later that night. And then a couple mornings later, I woke up to the strangest news story of my life. A group calling themselves Heaven\u2019s Gate had taken their own lives en masse out in California\u2014and they\u2019d left behind a video explaining why. They were catching a ride on the comet, with the full certainty that it would take them to paradise. They were leaving their human bodies behind, chasing the pure perfection of enlightenment. These were smart, educated people with families who loved them. What led them to this? Join us for the story of one of the deadliest cults in American history: Heaven\u0027s Gate.

      "description": "For thousands of years, human beings have sought spiritual connection and enlightenment. A lot of us are seekers by nature, we want to know why we\u2019re here and what\u2014if anything\u2014comes next. Sometimes it can seem like most of humankind is walking around with their heads in the sand, and we don\u2019t wanna be one of those people. We want to chase after the secrets. We want to be plugged in. There\u2019s a long tradition, as part of this search for truth, of self-deprivation as a spiritual virtue. Taking a vow of silence or poverty. Forbidding alcohol or dancing or sex. Fasting. Some people believe it strips away everything extra and leaves the spirit more open to connection with the infinite. Others prefer a more balanced approach to life, like the Buddhist Middle Way. But for those who choose to throw away worldly pleasures, the path can get pretty extreme. Today we\u2019ll tell you about a group who claim they\u2019ve given up one of our most basic needs\u2014food\u2014and have learned to live on nothing but light and air. Are these people just fully spiritually attuned, or are they just grifters?
