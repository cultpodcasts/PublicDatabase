      "description": "We\u2019re talking with Krispin and D.L. Mayfield about their project over on Substack called Strongwilled. James Dobson and Focus on the Family have impacted millions of people with their teachings about corporal punishment and breaking the will of children. Many of these children have grown up to speak out about how traumatic their upbringing was. What does the legacy of James Dobson mean for us as we live in a time of growing authoritarianism globally? We get into the nitty-gritty of authoritarian parenting, how we heal our nervous systems, and why we were so drawn to books about orphans when we were kids. Be sure to subscribe to Survivors Discuss for more episodes on life after toxic religion. Krispin and D.L. Mayfield are both products of the modern religious authoritarian parenting movement that has shaped millions and millions of evangelical Christians. Krispin is a therapist who specializes in working in religious trauma recovery and supporting neurodivergent clients. He wrote a book on attachment theory and Christianity in 2022 (and has since left the faith). He loves photography, music, and most anything creative. D.L. is the author of three books and a former freelance writer. They are a late-diagnosed autistic who currently has a special interest in exposing Christian authoritarianism and healing from high-control religion Strongwilled on Substack: https://strongwilled.substack.com/ Cohosts: Clare Heath-McIvor: kitkennedy.com Shari A.

Scott Okamoto as our guests for this episode to talk about racism in evangelicalism, decolonizing faith, intersectionality, and what it means to be an anti-racist as we move forward. White supremacy has deep roots in evangelicalism, and all too often, racist ideas and attitudes can follow us into the exvangelical community. Decolonizing our way of thinking is essential as we deconstruct our faith and find a new path away from toxic religion.

Find Naiomi on Instagram , Facebook , Substack , and YouTube Scott Okamoto (he/him) was raised evangelical and was a golden child of church and Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship in college. But he asked too many questions, disagreed with the answers, and slowly deconstructed through his early adulthood until he gave it all up while teaching English at an evangelical university. He is currently the creator and host of the Chapel Probation podcast , the author of Asian American Apostate: Losing Religion and Finding Myself at an Evangelical University (Lake Drive Books), and an editor and music supervisor for the newly launched Axis Mundi Media, an academic podcast company that is part of the Straight White American Jesus universe.
