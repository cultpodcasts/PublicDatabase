In this unimaginable environment, trafficking was just one among the many horrifying forms of abuse inflicted upon Kim and tens of thousands of children like her. \n\nAgainst all odds, she summoned the strength to escape at the age of 20 and courageously embarked on a journey to rebuild her life. \n\nAt the age of 30, she became acutely aware of the immense problem of child trafficking in the USA. Driven by a profound sense of horror and compassion, Kim delved into extensive research and aligned herself with select nonprofit organizations dedicated to exposing and eradicating this unfathomable crime.\n\n Now, armed with her unique experiences and intimate understanding of cult dynamics, brainwashing, grooming, ritualistic abuse, and child trafficking, Kim is tirelessly dedicated to raising awareness and educating the public in an effort to expose and combat this heart-wrenching nightmare.\n\nFind out more on how you can help end Child trafficking at https://unitingamericainc.org/survivor-center",
