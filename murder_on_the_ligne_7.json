      "description": "In 2006 the FBI added a new name to its most wanted list. It is Warren Jeffs, leader of a polygamous cult.This community, residing in the Short Creek area at the border between Utah and Arizona, is found to have practiced polygamy, underage marriages, rapes, and much more. The prophet, Warren Jeffs, allegedly having more than 80 wives, shaped the FLDS church throughout the years turning it into a dark cult where women were deprived of any freedom, including the freedom of thought.After all the accusations and trials, it is estimated that about 6,000 to 10,000 people are still a part of the church, supporting Warren Jeffs and following the preaching and sermons he holds behind bars.",
