      "description": "Mitch Brisker was a 23 year old heroin-addicted film school drop-out when he found Scientology in Downtown Hollywood. Through recovery, he went on to become a successful commercial director and caught the eye of Scientology\u2019s notorious leader, David Miscavige. Mitch ultimately became the chief architect of Scientology\u2019s global propaganda machine, creating the films Scientology still uses for recruitment and obedience. Nearly 30 years later Mitch left the cult and began speaking out about the abuses he witnessed and experienced. Throughout our chat he shares his moral injury of participating in the lasting influence of the cult of Scientology.

Being familiar with this sort of thing, I decided to join the Facebook group to see what it was all about and what the members were saying about the group, the belief system and the media exposure.

Please use discretion when listening.* 20 year ago, Emily Ragland was a freshman at Guilford College in North Carolina, playing on the softball team and studying to enter the field of civil rights. The Quaker based college appealed to her as a Christian, POC woman looking to make her place in the world for the first time in her life. But on October 31st, 2003 a violent attack changed every trajectory in Emily\u0027s life and left her to fend for herself in a system that wasn\u0027t built for her. For the 20th anniversary of that horrific day, Emily shares with us her whole story, and how it\u0027s shaped who she is today.

In part 1 we meet Amber, a Military wife who was willing to do what she had to do to keep her family as intact as possible. Enter Bomb Party.

Back then he was focus on building his products business, eventually making it to Emerald, but not seeing the same profits from others around him who had more of a \u0022Tools\u0022 focus. It wasn\u0027t until Steve started asking questions nobody wanted to answer that he started taking a closer look at where the money was coming from.

Even if you\u0027re not a fan, it\u0027s almost literally impossible not to support the company in some way. From the medical research facilities, to the concert halls and arenas, the Devos/Van Andel family have made their mark on West Michigan in more ways than one.

I mean sex is the only reason any of us are here, and to demonize it and twist scripture to fit this odd narrative to control women for the sake of men\u0027s needs seems culty and gross. This episode is for anyone who was ever shamed just for being human and having sexual wants and desires outside of what \u0022society\u0022 deemed appropriate.

Ever since that moment, and even before, I have been focused on the unspoken connection between MLMs and Neurodivergent people. How are we targeted? Why do we jump from one to the next? How much lipstick does one really need? So I asked someone who has a lot more knowledge about the subject, Layla Touchet, LPC, NCC, PSC to talk to us about why those of us with ND would be more drawn to MLMs, and how the MLMs use our symptoms to keep us stuck.

She\u0027s a powerhouse of comedy, historical oddities and autism education. We talked for over 4 hours and I cut it down to this (there is even more on Patreon!).

In 1997 the largest mass suicide on US soil happened as the Hale-Bopp Comet passed over earth. The tragedy was a result of the belief that evil space aliens were holding humans back from reaching their true potential, deeply held by the religious organization Heaven\u0027s Gate, founded in 1974 by leaders Ti and Do. One of the earliest members, Sharon Welsh just happened to be the aunt of my friend and fellow podcaster, Leslie Fear. So I asked Leslie if she would come help me tell the story of Heaven\u0027s Gate, using her never been told insider perspective.

It\u0027s been mentioned in many Amway episodes, but it\u0027s entire weight was largely unknown. So when fan of the show, and American Historian Sean Munger reached out with an episode idea, I was game. And after Paul talked so much about the tools in Britt World Wide, this episode seemed the perfect follow up! If you were ever curious about the cult of the motivational tapes, and the showdown with Amway that ensued, you gotta listen to this episode.

Michelle and Paul spent 10 years in Britt World Wide, a cult inside Amway that controlled every aspect of their life, including the level of communication they had with each other.

For Andrea, all she wanted to do was help people, so why not supplement her college degree with some self guided, self-help courses and become a certified life coach? But from day one, everything seemed strange, and instead of trusting her gut, she trusted handsome young men in fancy suits.

Please use discretion when listening.* Ella Kruczynska just wanted to document her health and weight loss journey on Instagram and maybe help a few people along the way. At first she was happy to find a community where she felt valued and welcomed, but when she was inundated with the same messages from different women proclaiming how amazing she was, how great she looked and how their miracle products could help her even more, she got suspicious. Ella didn\u0027t know what an MLM was, or why she needed these expensive shakes, but it wasn\u0027t until she couldn\u0027t take the harassment any longer that she looked deeper and started connecting the dots.

We\u0027ve chatted about how politics play a large role in MLMs in the US, but did you realize they are just as well connected across the pond?

Have you ever wanted to live a \u0022cleaner\u0022 or \u0022healthier\u0022 life? One day you\u0027re living free of toxic chemicals, the next you\u0027re being fear mongered into a wildly antithetical existence under the guise of \u0022business\u0022. For Atalie, being pregnant and terrified of harming her unborn child lead her down a path darker than she had imagined from a health and wellness company. It\u0027s a slippery slope from \u0022toxin free\u0022 to conspiracy theorist and Atalie walked the line for over 3 years before sharing her truth.

      "description": "One of the most vulnerable populations of people being sucked into MLM schemes are students, na\u00EFve, eager and looking for opportunity everywhere. That\u0027s how Ance Vanaga found herself in strange country at the age of 18, going door to door selling books for Southwestern Advantage, maybe the oldest MLM company we\u0027ve found so far. Over the years of unpacking her experience, Ance started looking into the mental health side of it, and was shocked at what she discovered. So we sat down with each other and had some deep, enlightening and hilarious conversations about MLM\u0027s, cults, gaslighting and what we both went through.

We place our faith and health in the hands of product reps who make illegal claims to get you to sign on the dotted line, but what could go wrong? I often get a lot of questions about the efficacy of essential oils as a natural health alternative, and so I asked my friend Kayla to come share her journey with that exact thing.

I always see comments and questions about the more UK based MLMs like The Body Shop at Home, FM World and Inteletravel. These just aren\u0027t MLMs that I run across all that often, so I reached out to someone who would know, Charlie Harris. Charlie speaks out on social media about the problems with MLMs in the UK and most specifically Inteletravel. her former company.

Dave and I met back in the early days of the AntiMLM movement on Facebook. He was an avid commenter and follower and over the years became a great friends in the fight against MLMs. Dave sends me a lot of the content we react to on YouTube, and is a wealth of information and has been an instrumental help with the FTC ANPR. But with all this time and effort in the movement, I\u0027ve never heard Dave\u0027s story, which comes from a very ernst place of love and compassion.

Listeners of the show receive 10% off their first month of online therapy by visiting betterhelp.com/mlm *CONTENT WARNING* - In this episode we talk about several topics that may be triggering, including infant loss, body image, psychological tactics and strong language. Please use discretion. Have you been watching the Monat Dumpster Fire on social media? It\u0027s hard to miss if you\u0027re following enough AntiMLM content. It all started when Angelique Robles, a Managing Market Mentor had some questions and concerns about things she was seeing happening within the company. What followed can only be described as a shitshow that lead her to reaching out to the AntiMLM community for real answers. I get so many comments about talking to Reps who are still in, so I asked her if she would be willing to chat about her life IN MLM and she agreed! But what happens in the middle of our chat is SHOCKING and literally CANNOT BE MISSED. I never expected this in a million years!

But before we get to the culty Monat stuff, Amber takes us on her journey through Beachbody, as an Emerald Coach golden child who had some of those \u0022not typical\u0022 results and was used in advertising and company propaganda to push the toxic diet culture MLMs thrive in. We explore the character arch of Beachbody darling, Autumn Calabrese, the ups and downs of disordered eating and how Beachbody plays a role in it all.

Whenever someone asks me about Kangen Water, I send them straight to Alanda and her work exposing Enagic and Darren and Mike. We also did some work together, exposing the culty scam Zafire back in 2021 with Chelsea Flores. But today Alanda has found some bigger fish to fry, in the form of a dangerously culty MLM called OnPassive that\u0027s getting some attention finally. I didn\u0027t know much about them, so I called Alanda and asked her to help us out! You\u0027ll even get to hear one of OnPassive\u0027s worship songs to their MLM Leader, Ash.

From pushing personal boundaries and feeling pressure to lie to the subtle ways that MLMs mess with us on the daily and #MLMeastereggs, Angie and my chat runs the gamut.

Tamara Rubin\u0027s young sons were acutely lead poisoned when a worker on their home wasn\u0027t using lead safe practices like he claimed. What followed became a passion for knowledge and public education on heavy metal safety and advocacy best known as Lead Safe Mama. Over the years, Tamara has tested a variety of MLM products with shocking results, including two current scams we won\u0027t let up about, Paparazzi and Black Oxygen Organics. Because she\u0027s a \u0022citizen scientist\u0022 and far better equipped to read the results than we are, I asked her to give us her interpretation on the new digestive results, compare them to her own XFR testing and let us know what we should be worried about and what areas to focus on for the biggest legal impact.

We\u0027re smack dab in the middle of making this podcast even better for 2022, so don\u0027t mind our dust or whatever people say when they are open during construction. You\u0027ll start to notice a few changes in the coming weeks, so stay tuned! Tracey Reid returns with ALL THE PAPA TEA!!! I cannot tell you how many comments I get about Tracey\u0027s episode, and people asking what she\u0027s been up to since the PapaDrama has NOT slowed down. So I hit her up and asked her to come back and share EVERYTHING she\u0027s been up to since we last sat down to chat, and IT\u0027S A LOT. Besides the Lead and Nickel allegations, and the third party testing, Tracey also gives us some details on a grassroots documentary with the working title of \u0022PapaPoor\u0022, the hate she\u0027s received since taking the reigns and exposing Paparazzi on her weekly show, Tea Time. It\u0027s everything you\u0027ve come to expect from Tracey Reid and more.

Jenni Wild is a PURE DELIGHT, and if you haven\u0027t heard of her until now, get ready to fall in love. Her content is filled with fact based education and empathetic compassion, while still being HILARIOUSLY charming and wholesome. She\u0027s got an amazing cast of characters she portrays on social, and her Drew Barrymore impersonation is air tight, but she brought back and old favorite just for us. I think we need a TikTok debut! As a former Monat Hun and someone with trichotillomania, Jenni has an interesting perspective on targeting those with hair loss that\u0027s valuable for anyone still in and finding themselves repeating these behaviors. We also touch on #WFABB and iGenius, and how the product doesn\u0027t really matter. Show Notes  Follow Jenni on Social!

I hope your season is filled with the embodiment of HOLIDAY MAGIC, as we count down to 2022! You may know her on social media as any number of her hilarious personas; Barb, the confused empty nester, Kkayleighee, the classic hunbot, or my favorite, Skeem Lee, the empathically intense MEGAHUN, but Mallory Grantz is much more than a cast of characters. As a music teacher by day, it\u0027s no surprise that she\u0027s loaded with talent and comedic timing. We chat about a lot of different topics including her participation in Tupperware and Perfectly Posh, and how MLM\u0027s take advantage of natural disasters and national tragedy in the name of sales.

Some accounts may be triggering. Please listen at your own discretion. This is meant as a companion series to the Amazon Docuseries, LuLaRich, and the Discovery\u002B show The Rise and Fall of LuLaRoe and is in no way affiliated with the films.* If you\u0027ve seen The Rise and Fall of LuLaRoe, you\u0027re familiar with Carla Hadfield, the owner of the Airstream and Sam\u0027s biggest victim. As with most exposes, a lot gets left on the cutting room floor, so when Carla expressed concern that some of what she shared might be cut out due to time constraints, I invited her to spill her guts to us. While Carla\u0027s MLM story isn\u0027t much different than most, what happened to her at the hands of a predator inside the organization definitely is. Through a series of vulnerable events, coercive conversations, and emotional manipulation, Sam stole almost everything Carla had, until she decided to fight back.

Plus, we speak with Rise and Fall star, Heather Blevins and the creator of the infamous group Defective, Julie Dean, about the early days of exposing LuLaRoe, running a Facebook group full of 75k\u002B angry LuLaRoe victims and what they think about everything that\u0027s happened after a pair of black leggings ripped to shreds.

It is a FANTASTIC accompaniment to those already personally working through these issues, or currently in therapy for them.

I hope your season is filled with the embodiment of HOLIDAY MAGIC, as we count down to 2022! Erin Bies spent A LOT of time in Multi Level Marketing, climbing as high as the Top 0.38% of her last company, Pruvit before deciding to pull the plug altogether after battling with her cognitive dissonance over AntiMLM content on her FYP. When she first saw me, she hated me, and that crack I talk about when helping people see MLM for what it is and get out? That\u0027s how it started. Over the next few months Erin went from culty MegaHun to educated AntiMLM Advocate, filling the hole in the community as someone finally speaking out about Pruvit, those ketone videos on TikTok, and their WILD Promoters with cult-like followings, who\u0027s stans aren\u0027t afraid to play dirty.

Jessica and I have been trying to get together ever since our followers couldn\u0027t stop tagging us in each others videos to get our attention. IT WORKED YOU GUYS!!! Jess makes some of the funniest, brutally honest ExHun content on social media that I have ever seen. She is unapologetically herself, owns her mistakes and uses them to educate for good. In our chat we discuss the internal struggle of being \u0022at the top\u0022 of the pyramid, what it REALLY looks like as you climb the pyramid, and what it REALLY takes to stay there. It might look like being in the 1% is worth all the time and effort, but Jessica\u0027s deep inside look at her time in ItWorks! paints quite the opposite picture.

Welcome to DAY 1 of 9 DAYS OF HOLIDAY MAGIC in the month of December! After toying around with a multitude of inclusive yet topical names, I landed on 9 DAYS Of HOLIDAY MAGIC, named after the spirit of the season AND the MLM that was shut down by the FTC in 1974 after being found to be operating as a pyramid scheme. I hope your season is filled with the embodiment of HOLIDAY MAGIC, as we count down to 2022! In August 2021, I heard about an MLM that was gaining popularity on social media called Black Oxygen Organics. A group of AntiMLM Advocates joined together to help create content and awareness across all platforms on a mysterious scam selling literal dirt as the cure to literally everything. The Boo Crew was born. On November 23rd, an email went out to all BOO reps, letting them know that the MLM would be closing it\u0027s doors amongst recalls, bad reactions, lawsuits, and a growing social media awareness movement. Obviously we had to hop on a zoom to chat with those who could! A bit of a warning, we have, at times, 5 very excited women on this chat, and mute was not always utilized, but I did my best! Thanks so much to Savannah Marie, Kat Benson, Jessica James and Amanda McQueen!!!

This month we are teaming up with igotout.org, a consortium of cult survivors supporting the #igotout movement of activism, and education, to help shine light on the commercial cults more commonly known as Multi Level Marketing. Throughout the month of November, follow along with us on social media as we share MLM statistics, cult education, survivor stories and ways you can join in on the movement. Visit igotout.org to share your MLM experience and share your #igotout selfie using the hashtags #igotout and #igotoutofanmlm on social media. Freedom of thought is a universal human right. For our last episode in November for MLM Cult Awareness Month, I knew EXACTLY who I needed to talk to, Laurie Jenks Hale, serial MLMer turned AntiMLM Advocate. Laurie was just 19 years old when she joined her first Multi Level Marketing company. At first the business seemed to be a good fit for her lifestyle as a young Mormon military wife (and veteran!), but no matter how hard Laurie tried, how many companies she joined, or what products she believed in, she could never make it to the top of the pyramid. In 40 years Laurie joined 19 different companies, 29 times and has many stories and experienced insight to share as she takes us down a wild journey of just trying to find a place that feels right, to call home.

When I first read Elizabeth\u0027s email to me, I knew I had to talk to her for our Cult Education Month. After watching LuLaRich, and diving into the Anti MLM Movement, Elizabeth left her MLM of 3 years, and publicly denounced them on her Facebook page. We talk about the culty ways MLM crept into her life, grooming her from a sick college student, to a young newlywed, the indoctrination into the oily life, and the hoops she jumped through in the name of blind faith. We also discuss the cognitive dissonance Elizabeth felt between what Young Living told her, and what she found out.

After being in for over 6 years, Molly finally saw the light, and left, and boy does she have A LOT to say about it. We chat about her time in Amway, their insidious ties to literally everything, Ponzinomics, cult tactics, cognitive dissonance, and even share the crazy encounter that happened on stage the night we met. Somehow she turns the interview around on me, and we talk about what we want the future of the Anti MLM Movement to look like and where we think it\u0027s headed.

      "description": "*This episode is intended for 18\u002B, and contains discussions on disordered eating, compromising situations and mentions toxic ideas on forgiving sexual trauma, in stories as retold by the guest. Please use discretion when listening to this episode if these topics may be triggering to you.* In 2019 \u0022Ariel\u0022 joined Optavia as a customer to help her maintain her weight as she weaned herself off cigarettes at 25 years old. Admittedly a bad idea in hindsight, she takes us down a wild ride of what life inside this MLM cult of health and wellness looked like, expensive disordered eating, dangerous caloric deficits, trauma and toxic diet culture. The deeper she got into Optavia, the worse her disordered eating became, counting calories, then binging, punishing herself with extra exercise, and even causing concern to strangers on the internet. \u0022Ariel\u0022\u0027s openness to being so loyal to the cult and \u0022business\u0022 lead to finding herself in a scary situation she wasn\u0027t sure how to get out of. But it wasn\u0027t until the Covid Pandemic and the aftereffects opened her eyes to what she was really involved with.

John was never in an MLM, but both of his parents were, as he juggled living between their homes. From an MLM hobbyist mother, who ran the gamut from Avon to Tastefully Simple, to John\u0027s deeply entrenched Herbalife peddling father, MLM was all around him growing up. I knew getting the perspective of the victims we don\u0027t think about, and the side effects of dragging children through the toxic complex of MLM would produce some eye opening discussions. Our conversation started off light but ended up getting pretty deep into some topics I didn\u0027t expect, like food poverty, the long lasting effects of growing up in hustle culture, and the buried feelings John has about what he was subjected to as a minor, often against his own will.

We discuss the culture in LuLaRoe, and what it was like being outside the target demographic, the tokenism, two faced lies and how culty it really was. Even as a small fish, who put her everything into it, she just couldn\u0027t make it work for her despite every attempt at making Mark\u0027s rotten lemons into lemonade.

The other day I was sent a video of DeAnne saying that LuLaRich was just 4 consultants complaining and not to base their opinions of LuLaRoe on 4 consultants experiences. So I put out a call to action and asked people to send in some of their experiences with LuLaRoe, because I knew there was A LOT more than 4.

He thought we would get along and have a lot to talk about, and boy was he right. Alex not only made the film about Smart Circle, he also worked for the company, an MLM you might not see coming. We chat about the many different heads of this hydra, where you might encounter Smart Circle, and what it can look like when you do.\u00A0Alex and I share some of the biggest red flags for avoiding these scams when navigating online job listings, or even your local grocery store.

After receiving Valentine\u0027s Day leggings as a gift, Tiffany was fascinated by the idea and joined as a side income to her already popular websites and businesses.

She\u0027s been holding in her story for the last 3 years, and recently found the strength to spill it all on the show. Sheri takes us down a rocky, red flag laden path, where she admittedly ignored all the signs, down unexpected twists and turns of When Boss Babes Attack, to finding herself in the middle of a hacking allegation with \u0022Bully Bill\u0022, LuLaRoe\u0027s infamous lawyer. She even spills quite a bit of tea on the leader who told people to \u0022sell their breast milk\u0022. Throughout her retelling of her time inside LuLaRoe, Sheri talks about the after effects of leaving, the PTSD, the shame and pain you feel as you come to the realization that you were a victim AND a predator.

Because she was a homeschooling mom, with little outlet outside of home, she began selling and sharing the opportunity within the theater company, convinced they needed the quality products that \u0022only Mary Kay could offer\u0022.

      "description": "*Content Warning* This story contains the exploitation of minors as young as 16, in a \u0022Student Financial Assistance\u0022 scam. Those who are sensitive to stories like this, please use your best judgement before proceeding. Chelsea Flores was a young woman living in the Philippines, when she heard about a financial assistance scam targeting young students in her area. The opportunity, Zafire Natural Beauty and Wellness, an MLM headed by a narcissistic cult-like leader, looked too good to be true. Although she was not a victim of Zafire, she knew she had to help the students get justice by telling their story on social media, hoping to get anyone\u0027s attention. In this bonus episode, we try to make sense of the scam known as Zafire Natural Beauty and Wellness. After Chelsea contacted me, I reached out to my friend Alanda Carter of the Recovering Hunbot and asked her if she would do a deep dive on the \u0022business\u0022 and it\u0027s egomaniacal leader while I talked to the victims.

      "description": "*Content Warning* This episode features a former rep from Pure Romance, an MLM that deals with adult products and toys. We talk about many topics that are not suitable for younger listeners, and could be triggering for some, including sexual situations and trauma. Please listen at your own discretion. \u0022Ruth\u0022 joined Pure Romance when her previous MLM, Slumber Parties was bought out and they were merged together. For 7 years, she was at the top 5% of the company, educating on sexual health and wellness, or so she thought. Despite any gut feelings, she stayed because she genuinely loved connecting with her customers. After realizing that some of the people she was helping needed a lot more than she could offer, \u0022Ruth\u0022 found her true calling.

I take the annual average wages, divide by 12 to get the monthly figure, then divide by 80 hours a month for part time wages. I think the results may shock you. For comparison, we also talk about minimum wages, livable wages, living comfortably, and what the going rate for labor is in the US Prison System. *I do say the wrong thing in this episode, stating I divided the monthly figure by 20 to get part time pay, but I meant to say \u0022divide by 80\u0022 (20 hours x 4 weeks) so forgive me, because the math still checks out.* Show Notes! \u0022Living Comfortably\u0022 : https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/living-wage-income-to-live-comfortably-in-every-us-state Prison Labor Wages : https://isps.yale.edu/news/blog/2013/10/time-to-reckon-with-prison-labor-0# Livable Wage Info\u00A0: https://livingwage.mit.edu/articles/61-new-living-wage-data-for-now-available-on-the-tool# Lollipop Moments : https://www.ted.com/talks/drew_dudley_everyday_leadership?language=en \u0022What does an average MLM or Network Marketing Distributor make per year?\u0022 : https://www.mlminsider.com/articles/what-does-an-average-mlm-or-network-marketing-distributor-make-per-year Ponzinomics by Robert L.

Katie was in LuLaRoe at the same time I was, experienced eerily similar things, but saw \u0022the rot\u0022 way before I could. Katie decided to leave LuLaRoe and speak out in print media, writing a scathing personal expose about her time in the cult. My conversation with Katie ran the gamete from relatable moldy leggings experiences, to her difficult mental health journey processing how MLM affected her and the aftermath of LuLaRoe and the Anti-MLM movement.
