      "description": "If the ingredients of something called a \u201Ccult\u201D include a charismatic figure and unquestioning followers, the phenomenon of \u201CKai the Hitchhiker\u201D helps us think about what happens when the power dynamic between those elements is inverted. Famous for the local news interview that launched a thousand memes, Kai was an unlikely hero whose lowkey charm saw people clamoring to make him a late-night and reality tv star. What do people offer and, alternatively, ignore when we want to see a particular story play out in a way that satisfies us? How do we respond when someone doesn\u2019t follow our social scripts about wealth and power? What stories do we tell retroactively to make it make sense? What do we expect of someone deemed charismatic, and what does that tell us about ourselves? We explore these questions and others, like: will we ever get the video working for this podcast? Hang in as we keep trying, dear listeners! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerinda\u0027s Cult Favorite:\n\n\nHanif Abdurraqib\u2019s \u201CTo Chan Marshall: A Letter to Cat Power\u201D (in season 2 of the Lost Notes podcast); then his own examination of musical moments and figures in 1980 for the 3rd season (the episode that reckons with the deaths of John Lennon and Darby Crash [lead singer of punk band Germs] is so good). Both are examples of attending to context with empathy, which is one of his trademarks and which siiiiiiiigh, thank you. \n\n\nMike\u0027s Cult Favorite:\n\n\n\u201CI Don\u2019t Like Who I Was Then\u201D by The Wonder Years (https://open.spotify.com/track/0tsDCPVmJHLFvai2blxIwv) \n\n\nAs an undermatured 40 year old recovering emo kid, a song where a dude sings about genuinely tryingto be a better person with the lyric \u201CLike I\u0027m working babyface, Out of Mid-South in the eighties, I kept a blade hidden in my wrist tape\u201D just hits me right in the heart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on the socials at @cultfavoritepod.\n\n\nProduction assistance from the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Alabama. \n\n\nTheme music produced with Udio.",

This week we talk about Netflix documentary OneTaste: Orgasm, Inc. \u2014the story of boss babe Nicole Daedone, who made big business out of personal pleasure. Hers is a love story between capitalism and heteropatriarchy, with supporting roles from yoga, meditation, sexual awakening, exploitative profiteering, and coercion. Questions abound, including but not limited to: What happens to a cultural narrative when it\u2019s rendered \u201Creligious\u201D? When do scholars get interviewed, and when do they not? What kinds of conditions would foreclose a company like OneTaste from succeeding in the first place? When is exploitation a story people pay attention to, and when is it just a regular day at the office? Come for the answers, stay for the conversational bookends. Merinda gives a reading! Mike learns what mycology is! And remember, kids, context always shapes the stuff we call special.

But go listen anyway, folx\u2014it\u0027s a doozy), here\u2019s wishing your ears a happy Monday with our latest episode on Ra\u00EBl: The Alien Prophet (2024). Spreading the message of the Elohim\u2014an extraterrestrial species they believe to be responsible for creating human life on Earth\u2014Ra\u00EBlians got their start in France in the 1970s, started a lab called Clonaid, spoke before the U.S. Congress, and now boast an international movement. Vehicular modes of transport in this episode include not only spaceships but also Mike\u2019s Hot Take Express! We hop aboard the latter to talk craft, genre, and the clich\u00E9s and expectations attending them. What does free love have to do with human cloning? Why are claims about human exceptionalism so pervasive? How is a cult documentary like a sonnet? And does the Hot Take Express have a good snack cart?

It\u2019s easy to get lost in there, so we\u2019ll take you through it, highlighting corporate appeals to individualism, capitalist aesthetics, and the ways that both those things prey especially upon women. As we wind our way through mall-walkers, Mike plays some very impressive word jenga, Merinda doesn\u2019t know whether someone gets \u201Cgaslit\u201D or \u201Cgaslighted\u201D (she goes with the latter), and they learn that they are both pro-candy corn.

Conversational topics include but are not limited to: 1980s diet culture, patriarchy in conservative American Protestantism, gender politics and anti-fat bias, and what gets normalized when religious groups are said to warp/twist/exploit a certain text or tradition. Mike drops some personal lore about parenting workshops, Merinda explains why she doesn\u2019t like an exceptionalism narrative, and both agree that it\u2019s annoying when gawking at big hair stands in for critiquing capitalist tax codes.

      "description": "What can possibly make sense of a billion-year contract or a billion-page menu? We\u0027re on the case, with a conversation that ranges from Scientology\u2019s Sea Org to The Cheesecake Factory\u2019s dizzying array of food options. This week, we\u2019re talking about Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief. Cameos include (but are not limited to): Rock Hudson, Majorie Cameron, John Travolta, Aleister Crowley, and (most importantly, as far as Merinda\u2019s concerned) Kate Bornstein. When does the relationship between religion and money seem fine v. not-fine and why? What makes makeshift military pastiche different from time-honored religious rituals/garb? What makes a group appeal to people, and when do we feel compelled (or not) to explain that appeal in the first place? And does our podcast deserve a playlist?

      "description": "This week, we go online and off the grid to The Garden, where video posts began a debate over whether the group is a commune or a cult. But who ultimately decides? What criteria do they use? And what (if anything) is gained by the question in the first place? We discuss these matters and more, learning along the way a few things about how subsistence and social formation converge/collide. So come burn a fear tower with us as we intrepid explorers trek boldly into analysis! While the dynamics of holding a community together are legion and complex, there is clarity about the following: If you\u2019ve got a hankering to put some first-person pronouns in a research paper, Merinda\u2019s classes have got your back...but in the event of a natural disaster and/or zombie apocalypse, Mike\u2019s house is definitely where you should take shelter. #cultfavorite Links: Interviews w/ Producers https://www.cynopsis.com/cyncity/pushed-to-the-limit-for-the-garden-commune-or-cult/ https://worldscreen.com/tvreal/the-garden-commune-or-cults-annie-taylor-naimah-holmes/ For Everyone Collective: https://foreveryonecollective.com/ Religion in Culture MA Program at University of Alabama: https://religion.ua.edu/graduate/ Follow us on all the socials @cultfavoritepod Production assistance from the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Alabama.

      "description": "This week, Mike convinced Merinda to watch Secret Lives of Mormon Wives! Luckily, docu-soaps offer a neato middle ground between documentaries and reality tv. We talk genre, gender, sexuality, power, audiences, tradwives, the capital of \u201Ccute,\u201D and Mormon media. Merinda quotes people she admires. She also describes her Very Strong Feelings about the tendency to reduce/oversimplify complex worlds inhabited by women creating media content. Inasmuch as we should #believewomen, we should also pay serious attention to pop culture by and about women, even (especially?) when it cuts against our comfort zones. We should also, it turns out, make sure to label moving boxes with some degree of nuance. Come hang and follow/subscribe wherever you listen to things. Meanwhile, know this: if you invite us to an important life event, we promise to show up for you. We will also totally tell you if we ever see toilet paper stuck to your shoe.

      "description": "The Netflix documentary Wild, Wild, Country tells the story of Rajneeshpuram, a commune founded by the Indian guru Shri Bhagwan Rajneesh in Oregon in 1981. The followers turned a 60,000 acre ranch in central Oregon into their own spiritual commune. Led by Bhagwan\u0027s personal secretary, Ma Anand Sheela, the Rajneeshees eventually took over the government of nearby town of Antelope, Oregon and its population of 40 residents. As more and more Rajneeshees moved to Oregon, tensions between the spiritual seeker newcomers and the conservative locals turned dangerous. In part 1 of 2, we discuss the first three episodes of the documentary series. It\u0027s an example of when a religious minority lays claim to and tries to participate in behaviors and norms of \u0022traditional American values,\u0022 we see the mundane ways that stuff inevitably plays out: petitions, injunctions, city orders, land use, and lawsuits. There is a lot of bureaucracy to religion.

On another level, though, it\u2019s also about fast fashion as a phenomenon\u2014with Brandy Melville as just one example of a much bigger machine and structural reality. In exploring Brandy Melville, the film examines how fast fashion is built on racist, colonial, and exploitative practices that disproportionately affect women of color around the world. The doc goes back and forth between the teenage girl employees of the company and the abuses they describe and Accra, Ghana, where there\u2019s an unconscionable amount of textile waste. We learn about how it gets there, what the effects are, and what some people are trying to do about it. In our discussion of the talk about how desire is produced and how the real cult is capitalism.
