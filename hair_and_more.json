      "description": "Thank you so much for stopping by. This is the second part of the series I started a few days ago about my experience in a cult-like church in Lagos State. In this video, I shared a time when they manipulated me into believing that someone had sexually abused me, all to make me hate the person and prevent me from leaving the church. At the time, I had no idea that this was happening because I trusted them. Now, looking back, I can clearly see that it was simply a manipulative control tactic to keep me from leaving.",
