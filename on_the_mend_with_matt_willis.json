      "description": "Recovery isn\u2019t a straight line, and Matt Willis reflects openly on what that reality has meant for him.\n\nThis solo episode is part 2 of Matt Willis taking a trip down memory lane where he speaks candidly about addiction, recovery, and the long process of learning to live differently. He explores the moments that forced him to confront himself, the challenges of trying to change alone, and the ongoing work required to stay well.\n\nRather than offering simple answers, Matt discusses the uncertainty, setbacks, and searching that shaped his recovery, alongside the role of responsibility, trust, and fatherhood in helping him find steadier ground.\n\nThis is a thoughtful, honest conversation about resilience, accountability, and what it really means to commit to change, without shortcuts, and without pretending recovery is linear.\n\n00:00 When Enough Was Enough\n05:00 Running From Rehab\n09:00 The Man Who Carried Me In\n13:00 Married Three Days Sober\n17:00 Searching for Something to Believe\n22:00 Fatherhood Changed Everything\n27:00 A Relapse That Broke Me\n31:00 Throwing the Drugs Away\n36:00 Returning Without Using\n40:00 The ADHD Realisation\n46:00 Why Recovery Must Be Shared\n\nSimba mattresses \uD83D\uDC49Great recovery starts with great sleep.
