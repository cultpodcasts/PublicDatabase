      "description": "Charles Manson and his infamous \u0027hippy killers\u0027 shattered the illusion of peace and love in 1960s California. Leading the Manson Family cult, Manson manipulated his followers\u2014who seemed to embody the free-spirited, anti-establishment ideals of the hippy era\u2014into committing brutal, senseless murders. In the summer of 1969, this so-called family turned on Hollywood\u2019s elite, culminating in the tragic killing of actress Sharon Tate, who was 8 months pregnant, and others in a spree that would haunt the nation. Discover how a twisted vision turned a hippy dream into a nightmare that forever scarred American history.\n\nStars: Glen Lloyd\nDirector: Remone Jones\nWriter: Remone Jones\n\nWelcome to The World of Crime\u00AE, the ultimate YouTube channel for true crime enthusiasts!
