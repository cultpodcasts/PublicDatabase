Have you ever attended a church that openly preached that their group was the only right one, or at least the rightest one by far in the area? (Or did they just live like this was the case?) In Brethren circles, non-membership has its privileges. Sports and poker metaphors. Teaching people they can\u0027t simply go to another church intensifies the fighting over everything in the group you\u0027ve made the only game in town. How many drummers does one man need? A lot of painstaking technical trickery, trying to make a blast from the past blast rather than crash. Closing in prayer as a way of forestalling an open discussion.

      "description": "Trying to start something with a woman seemed on a level with attempting a trip to the moon. John Brereton holds forth on the evils of teaching contraception in sex ed class at school, all without uttering the words \u201Csex\u201D or \u201Ccontraception.\u201D Paul Washer insists that it\u2019s definitely not poetry. Kris Priestap sings in 1989. I discover that theremins are the most fretless instruments I have attempted (besides drums, of course). Can you tell whether my sister is singing backward or forward? Will all the spacey, beepy, funky stuff blend? Can I Barry White? Personnel Bass: Adam Fogo Keyboard: Mike Dubue Backing Vocals: Debbie Moore-Michelin Electric Guitar Beeps: Troy Tuttle",

      "description": "Bitterness: like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die? A serious look at suicidal ideation, youthful resentment and a mania for bladed weapons. A church culture in which there were few worse sins than being resentful if they mistreated you, and \u0022forgiveness\u0022 was your job, not theirs. I was delighted to score a session player who could do Spanish guitar. Had to play conga drums myself. Had a teacher colleague add some chimey electric and soloing to my mudslide/ocean surf rhythm guitar sound. Tinkered with recordings of my sister doing horror movie style screams to make them sound more disturbing. Stuff like that.

      "description": "What was adolescent depression like? How did school and youth group make it much worse? How to turn abject misery into something rhythmic and melodic. Learning about vintage tube amps, doubled tracks and odd percussion choices. (Note, although seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is certainly a huge problem at Christmas time because it\u0027s December, many mental health professionals do not believe that suicide is actually any more likely during that month than any other. I can simply stand behind the idea that I associate Christmas with loneliness, darkness, cold and socially complicated and upsetting mandatory extroversion work and family situations, and that little else depresses me as profoundly as people pressuring me to be merry and festive and into the music and sweaters if I can\u0027t muster that up. Also, the fact that this \u0022Suicide in December\u0022 idea is so prevalent makes the Christmas season seem dangerous and fraught.)",

I\u0027m trying out the \u0022chapters\u0022 function so people can skip bits if they like. This one has to go into it all: Church intrigue. Weaponized bible. Personal and family sacrifice. Tradition vs. change. Competitive piety pageants. Does God really hate fun as much as we were led to believe? Additional musicians: Debbie Moore-Michelin (backing vocals), Chris Metcalfe (drums and jaw harp), Andy Graham (bass guitar), Chris Carriere (electric rhythm guitar and initial recording engineering), Trevor Finlay (solo slide guitar), Chuck Hendricks (sermon about breaking sheep\u0027s legs to stop them from straying from the flock).
