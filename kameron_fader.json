Once I found out they were a malicious, vindictive, corporation I couldn\u0027t go back. Unfortunately, they kept all my friends and family that do not speak to me to this day. Company policy.\n\nAfterward, I went looking for true Christianity. I felt that maybe God had awoken me to the true word of Christ. \n\nThis is what I found. The real \u0022truth\u0022.\n\nI wouldn\u0027t recommend watching this if you aren\u0027t open to opposing views other than yours. This needs an open mind. \n\nOnce I found out the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses had lied to me my entire life, I went searching the Bible for more answers as well as Chrisitan churches. \n\nTo this day they haven\u0027t answered my questions.

Dissfellowshiping/Excommunication/Shunning/Isolation/\n(excommunication) and shunning was introduced in its current format in the 1940/50s. This is despite the 1947\u00A0Awake!\u00A0explaining the pagan origins of this practice.\n Awake\u00A01947 Jan 8 p.27\u00A0\n \u0022The\u00A0Encyclopaedia Britannica\u00A0says that papal excommunication is not without pagan influence, \u0022and its variations cannot be adequately explained unless account be taken of several non-Christian analogues of excommunication.\u0022 The superstitious Greeks believed that when an excommunicated person died the Devil entered the body, and therefore, \u0022in order to prevent it, the relatives of the deceased cut his body in pieces and boil them in wine.\u0022 Even the Druids had a method of expelling those who lost faith in their religious superstitions. It was therefore after Catholicism adopted its pagan practices, A.D. 325, that this new chapter in religious excommunication was written.\u0022\n \n http://ia601406.us.archive.org/23/items/WatchtowerLibrary/magazines/g/g1947_E.pdf\n \n From https://www.jwfacts.com/watchtower/quotes/pagan-practices.php\n\nStalk me (in a non-creepy way please):\n\nInstagram: https://goo.gl/swbNyV\n\n5 Ways to Find Yourself After Leaving Your Faith:\nhttps://youtu.be/mQA8rC81jfI\n\nWhy I left JW\u0027s:\nhttps://youtu.be/PRuCSUfaxqw\n\nReasons\u0027 Why I Won\u0027t Go Back:\nhttps://youtu.be/JN2FN1h6kuA\n\nHow to Recover after leaving:\nhttps://youtu.be/NxmYScCtyiQ\n\nHow to make friends after leaving:\nhttps://youtu.be/Ju9Wufc5BMw\n\nMusic by Ryan Little\nhttps://soundcloud.com/iamryanlittle\n\nSee you soon, Brothers \u0026 Sisters",

She started communicating with me and I reached out back to her. \n\nMy last search for my family vlog: https://youtu.be/3Qh7ZXixl18\n\nMy name is Kameron and I\u0027ve been Dissfellowshipped for a few years for falling in love with a girl. I began picking up my Bible this year, reading it to return to Jehovah, but something else happened. I started to realize the questions I had as a child were very good and real questions to ask. I began to awaken.\n\nIn fact, by reading the New World Translation, NIV KJ and more I realized that a lot of points the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses make were not backed by the Bible and in many situations were very cruel. \n\nScriptures on disfellowshiping that have been misused. \n1 Cor. 5:11 - 13\n\n2  John 1: 9 -11\n\nThe act of disfellowshipping is not scriptural. The word  disfellowship isn\u0027t even in the bible. \n\nIn Fact, Jesus did not say to shun the unrepentant wrongdoer,\n\nbut to treat them as a tax collector, which he himself spoke to \n\nand ate with -  Matthew 9:11.\n\n\nI began my search for the few blood family members I have left. Mainly my Mother and her Sister. I have a few cousins I\u0027d love to reach out to, too. \n\nWhether this turns out amazing or not, I feel it\u0027s important to share\nmy experience with you. As painful as it may be, I wasn\u0027t going to do it. But, I\u0027ve decided to share this very personal part of my life with you.
