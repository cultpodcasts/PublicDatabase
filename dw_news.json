Sensitive private information about several of Epstein\u0027s victims  was NOT blacked out.

      "description": "Last Friday, US authorities released another batch of files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein, if you need reminding, was a convicted sex offender. He died in a New York prison in 2019 while awaiting another trial for running a sex trafficking operation involving underage girls. The latest release \u2013 made up of more than 3 million documents, images, and videos \u2013 gives new insights into Epstein\u0027s ties to the rich and powerful. \n\nIt is also fueling speculation that Epstein could have been working for Russia. The suspicion is that Epstein would lure his powerful connections into sexual encounters, which were then used for the purposes of blackmail.\n\nThis tactic is synonymous with Russian intelligence, who have their very own name for this compromising material: \u0027kompromat\u0027. At least one European leader appears to be taking the potential Russian connection very seriously \u2013 Polish prime minister Donald Tusk.

      "title": "Epstein files: What\u0027s behind the investigations into disgraced UK envoy Mandelson? | DW News",
      "description": "Peter Mandelson, a former heavyweight of the UK political scene, is stepping down from his position in the House of Lords in light of new revelations in the Epstein files, the speaker of the house announced on Tuesday. Mandelson\u0027s connection to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein was already known about, but newly released files showed that the Labour Party politician had sent emails to the deceased sex offender offering nuggets of information, and in doing so may have broken the law. A spokesperson for Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the emails sent to Epstein contained \u0022likely market-sensitive information.\u0022\n\nUK police are looking into whether Mandelson could face a criminal investigation. That investigation was announced on Monday, a day after Mandelson also quit the Labour Party. Starmer\u0027s spokesperson on Tuesday said the prime minister told his Cabinet that his government would cooperate with the police in any inquiries, and also said he was not reassured that all pertinent information had yet emerged.\n\nWhat are the new revelations about Peter Mandelson?\nThe new Epstein file release \u2014 more than 3 million pages of documents related to the US Justice Department\u0027s case \u2014 shows how Mandelson passed on sensitive information around the time of the 2008 financial crisis. In one case, the then business secretary in the UK government sent Epstein an internal government report that was looking at how the country could raise money following the crash, including suggesting the sell-off of government assets. In May 2010, he sent another message that \u0022sources tell me 500 b euro bailout\u0022 is almost complete. It came just hours before European governments announced a \u20AC500 billion deal in an attempt to protect the euro.\n\nWho is Peter Mandelson? \nMandelson, 72, has been a fairly prominent figure in British politics since the early 1990s, when he first took a seat in the House of Commons. He was particularly known for his skills as a strategist and fixer, working as the Labour Party\u0027s director of communications even before he took elected office. Mandelson served in various ministerial roles in the governments of Labour Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, including Business Secretary and the organizational role of First Secretary of State that is often compared to the role of deputy prime minister, with neither of those positions permanently filled. He\u0027s been no stranger to scandal or to resignation in the past, resigning from Tony Blair\u0027s Cabinet in 1998 over an undisclosed loan for a home from a party ally with links to a media mogul. In 2001, he had to resign once more, this time over allegations of seeking to improperly influence a passport application. Mandelson had a stint in Brussels as European Commissioner for Trade from 2004 to 2008, in between roles in British governments. Most recently, he returned as Ambassador to the United States under the latest Labour prime minister, Keir Starmer. He was dismissed from this role late last year as his ties to Epstein began to come to light. Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, wrote on social media that the speed of Mandelson\u0027s latest downfall raised questions about Starmer\u0027s decision to bring him back into a prominent position as US ambassador last year.\n\n#Epstein #EpsteinFiles #PeterMandelson\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n\u25BAInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n\u25BATikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n\u25BAFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n\u25BATwitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nF\u00FCr Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1",

In a letter to Congress obtained by Associated Press, the Department of Justice acknowledged that the complete set of files was not released and that the government expects more disclosures by the end of the year. Of the documents that were released, many were heavily redacted without explanation. For instance, over 100 images were entirely blacked out, without explanations. Dozens of other images showed staircases. It is unclear how substantive the data sets are given the lack of context from the Department of Justice.\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n\u25BAInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n\u25BATikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n\u25BAFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n\u25BATwitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nF\u00FCr Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#epsteinfiles #trump",
