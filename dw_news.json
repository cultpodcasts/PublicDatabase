      "description": "The US Justice Department has released a trove of documents related to the prosecution of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. US Representatives Ro Khanna (Democrat) and Thomas Massie (Republican) have been pressing for the release of the documents in accordance with the \u0022Epstein Files Transparency Act,\u0022 and say the recent release does not comply with the law. The release leaves out many documents in the DOJ\u0027s possession and is criticized by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers for redacting potentially valuable information. \n\nChapter Breakdown\n00:00 Lawmakers criticize DOJ\u0027s redacted release of Epstein files\n0:28 Ethan Bearman, Attorney and Adjunct Professor at Loyola Law School, LA, as to why the DOJ release is not in compliance with the law\n4:34 What\u0027s been redacted in the Epstein files?\n\n#epsteinfiles #trump #sexoffenderepstein\n\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n\u25BAInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n\u25BATikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n\u25BAFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n\u25BATwitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nF\u00FCr Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1",

      "description": "The documents released on Friday are roughly 4,000 images in five data sets. That is a thin slice of the hundreds of thousands of files the Department of Justice has. In a letter to Congress obtained by Associated Press, the Department of Justice acknowledged that the complete set of files was not released and that the government expects more disclosures by the end of the year. Of the documents that were released, many were heavily redacted without explanation. For instance, over 100 images were entirely blacked out, without explanations. Dozens of other images showed staircases. It is unclear how substantive the data sets are given the lack of context from the Department of Justice.\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n\u25BAInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n\u25BATikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n\u25BAFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n\u25BATwitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nF\u00FCr Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#epsteinfiles #trump",

      "description": "The name Andrew Albert Christian Edward Mountbatten Windsor might sound regal, but it\u0027s missing one word - \u0022Prince\u0022. Britain\u0027s King Charles has begun the process of removing his brother Andrew\u0027s royal titles. The former prince has also been told to vacate his royal residence. For months, pressure to act has been mounting on the King over Andrew\u0027s links to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. \n\nThe family of the late Virginia Giuffre, who accused Andrew of sexual abuse, welcomed the decision. They are now calling for an investigation into the former prince, though Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing. \n\nCorrections:\n0:38 We meant Prince Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, not Prince Maurice Battenberg!\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Andrew loses title of Prince\n3:42 Andrew Lownie, Royal historian \n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n\u25BAInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n\u25BATikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n\u25BAFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n\u25BATwitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nF\u00FCr Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n#princeandrew #epstein #royals",
