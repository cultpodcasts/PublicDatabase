      "description": "It\u0027s the video that I feel like you have all been waiting for. Finally, I go over the six memoirs about the Church of the Firstborn of the Fulness of Time and its rival Church of the Lamb of God, and how the latter becomes vicious under the leadership of Ervil LeBaron. Within this world of insanity, women grow up, are married off, and raise children in these polygamist cults that seems to only serve the men around them. \n\nTimestamps:\nIntroduction: 00:00 - 00:58\nShattered Dreams: 00:59 - 4:09 \nDaughters of Zion: A Family\u0027s Conversion to Polygamy: 4:10 - 7:21\nFavorite Wife: 7:21- 12:41\nThe Sounds of Gravel: 12:42-17:13\nThe Polygamist\u0027s Daughter: 17:14-21:16\nDad Scares Me God Scares Me: 21:16\n\nBooks Referenced - \n\nLeBaron, Anna.
