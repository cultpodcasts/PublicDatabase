I am sorry for any unintended implied insult. I actually recommend fading and commend people that see the religion is not the truth and have the strength to fade. I was referring to a small group that have not determined if it is the truth or not, become inactive, and then go rushing back each time there is a calamity, in fear that maybe Armageddon be coming.\n\nThe transcript of this recording, including all data, graphs and charts is at https://www.jwfacts.com/watchtower/statistics.php.\n\nPlease do not use my channel as your personal soap box to push a religious agenda, Watchtower or otherwise.
