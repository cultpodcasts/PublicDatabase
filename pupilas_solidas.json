      "description": "No copyright infringement intended belongs to the Record Label/Company and the Artist\n\n00:00 Mister D.J.\n02:46 Lord, Hold My Hand\n04:41 Swing Down Sweet Chariot\n07:24 Stand By Me\n10:04 Sunday School To Broadway\n13:07 So High\n15:03 If The Lord Wasn\u0027t Walking By My Side\n16:55 Lead Me, Guide Me\n19:24 Working On The Building\n21:10 Onward Christian Soldiers\n\nThis record was made by Tony and Susan Alamo, founders of a religious group called the Alamo Christian Foundation. Over time, the group became known for being very closed and strict, with strong control over its members.\n\nThis video is shared for educational and cultural purposes only. It does not support or promote the group. It\u2019s part of a music archive that explores how sound and belief systems were used together.\n\nAfter Susan passed away, Tony Alamo was arrested and sentenced for serious crimes related to how he treated people inside the group. The community was mostly shut down, though some followers stayed active for a while.\n\nThis channel shares rare music like this to help people reflect on how even music can be used to influence or control.",
