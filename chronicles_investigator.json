      "description": "This is the horrifying story of The Ant Hill Kids, a Canadian cult led by Roch Th\u00E9riault. At first, he seemed kind and promised love and healing, but underneath, he was controlling and cruel. What looked like a peaceful commune was actually a place of fear and suffering. His followers faced terrible ab*se, trapped by his manipulation with no way out. In this video, we reveal the shocking truth about what really happened, the disturbing things Roch did, and the incredible strength of those who survived.
