I\u0027m breaking down the Instagram account Pastors With Props that exposes these ridiculous sermons where preachers claim God puts extra fries in your bag and that giving them money makes you richer.\n\nFrom football-throwing pastors to bizarre slavery apologetics disguised as marriage advice, these mega church grifters are saying the quiet part loud. We\u0027re talking Kenneth Copeland-style prosperity gospel where your donations supposedly come back multiplied, classic manipulation tactics targeting vulnerable believers.\n\nThese aren\u0027t just embarrassing sermon moments - this is the playbook mega churches use to extract money from their congregations. When pastors start using props and entertainment instead of substance, you\u0027re watching a grift in action. The teddy bear sermon about \u0022releasing what\u0027s in your hand\u0022 is textbook prosperity gospel manipulation.\n\nCheck out my shop at OwenMorgan.com/shop for skeptic merch.\n\n#prosperitygospel #megachurch #religiousgrifters\n\n\uD83D\uDD25 Support the Show:\nBecome a Patreon Member: https://owenmorgan.com/patreon\n\nRead my books:\n\uD83D\uDCD6 Was Hitler an Atheist? https://owenmorgan.com/whaa\n\uD83D\uDCD6 Understanding Jehovah\u0027\u0027s Witnesses: https://owenmorgan.com/ujw\n\n\uD83C\uDFA5 Watch on YouTube:\n\nTelltale: https://www.youtube.com/@owenmorgantelltale\nTelltale Fireside Chat: https://www.youtube.com/@telltalefiresidechat\nTelltale Unfiltered: https://www.youtube.com/@telltaleunfiltered\nPixel Dreams: https://www.youtube.com/@owenpixeldreams\nTwitch: https://owenmorgan.com/twitch",

      "description": "In this analysis, we examine the claims surrounding end-times predictions and their connection to current events. The video explores how biblical prophecy is often misinterpreted for political or social purposes, with a focus on evidence-based discussion rather than fear-mongering. We analyze the impact of such predictions on communities and discuss the importance of critical thinking when evaluating religious claims. Join us as we separate fact from fiction in this comprehensive look at faith, politics, and prophecy.\n\n#DebunkingReligion #TrumpFaith #BibleProphecy #EndTimesFacts #ReligiousAccountability #CriticalThinking #FaithAnalysis #ReligiousMisinformation #EvidenceBasedDiscussion #PoliticalReligion\n\n\uD83D\uDD25 Support the Channel:\n\nBecome a YouTube Member  \nPatreon: https://owenmorgan.com/patreon  \n\nRead my books:\n\uD83D\uDCD6 Was Hitler an Atheist? https://owenmorgan.com/whaa\n\uD83D\uDCD6 Understanding Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses: https://owenmorgan.com/ujw\n\n\uD83C\uDFA5 Watch My Other Channels:\n\nTelltale: https://www.youtube.com/@OwenMorganTelltale  \nTelltale Fireside Chat: https://www.youtube.com/@telltalefiresidechat  \nTelltale Unfiltered: https://www.youtube.com/@telltaleunfiltered  \nPixel Dreams: https://www.youtube.com/@owenpixeldreams\nTwitch: https://owenmorgan.com/twitch",

      "description": "Romana Didulo, the self-proclaimed \u201CQueen of Canada\u201D and leader of a dangerous QAnon-linked cult, has been arrested on weapons-related charges after her bizarre takeover of a small town. Her followers have long treated her as a monarch, obeying her so-called decrees and pledges of loyalty, but this time the law caught up with her.  \n\nIn this video, we break down what happened, why this arrest matters, and how her cult has spiraled into increasingly dangerous territory. From bizarre proclamations to armed standoffs, Didulo\u2019s story is a chilling reminder of how far extremist conspiracy movements can go.  \n#RomanaDidulo #QueenOfCanada #Cult #Arrested #QAnon #WeaponsCharges #Telltale #OwenMorgan\n\n\uD83D\uDD25 Support the Channel:  \n\nBecome a YouTube Member  \nPatreon: https://owenmorgan.com/patreon  \n\uD83D\uDCD6 Was Hitler an Atheist?
