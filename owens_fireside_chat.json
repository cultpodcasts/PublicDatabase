      "description": "0:00 - Hank Kahneman claims God ordered Trump to invade Venezuela for oil\n2:35 - Kahneman advocates for political violence using Jesus as justification\n4:35 - Kahneman uses homophobic slurs claiming Jesus called out sexual sin\n5:20 - Kahneman\u0027s failed prophecies about Mike Lindell\u0027s lawsuits and appeals\n7:28 - Owen promotes firesidewatch.com and Patreon before continuing analysis\n7:52 - Kahneman prophesies prosperity for Mike Lindell despite his bankruptcy\n9:56 - Kahneman uses cold reading tricks to fake faith healing at Flashpoint\n\nMAGA prophet Hank Kunneman is using faith healing scams to exploit elderly cancer patients, and his cold reading tricks are easier to spot than you\u0027d think. This pastor claims God told him Trump should invade Venezuela for oil, uses homophobic slurs from the pulpit, and justifies political violence by citing Hitler\u0027s favorite Bible verse.\n\nI break down Kunneman\u0027s failed prophecy about Mike Lindell winning his lawsuit, his transparent cold reading techniques at Flashpoint events, and how he targets vulnerable 60-80 year olds with recent cancer diagnoses. Watch as he goes from vague claims to specific \u0022words of knowledge\u0022 using basic statistical probability with a crowd of 10,000 elderly attendees.\n\nThis isn\u0027t just bad theology - it\u0027s deliberate exploitation that prevents people from seeking proper medical care while creating lifelong donors. From advocating theft of natural resources to encouraging violence, Hank Kunneman represents everything dangerous about mixing Christian nationalism with false prophecy and faith healing fraud.\n\n#FalseProphet #FaithHealing #ReligiousGrifters\n\n\uD83D\uDD25 Support the Show:\nBecome a Patreon Member: https://owenmorgan.com/patreon\n\nRead my books:\n\uD83D\uDCD6 Was Hitler an Atheist? https://owenmorgan.com/whaa\n\uD83D\uDCD6 Understanding Jehovah\u0027\u0027s Witnesses: https://owenmorgan.com/ujw\n\n\uD83C\uDFA5 Watch on YouTube:\n\nTelltale: https://www.youtube.com/@owenmorgantelltale\nTelltale Fireside Chat: https://www.youtube.com/@telltalefiresidechat\nTelltale Unfiltered: https://www.youtube.com/@telltaleunfiltered\nPixel Dreams: https://www.youtube.com/@owenpixeldreams\nTwitch: https://owenmorgan.com/twitch",

This interview reveals the racist core of white Christian nationalism and its connections to figures like Charlie Kirk and Shane Vaughn.\n\nThe KKK leader promotes \u0022British Israelism\u0022 - a Nazi-adjacent theology claiming white Europeans are the true Israelites with a special covenant from God. He argues for \u0022re-migration\u0022 of non-whites while insisting he\u0027s not racist. He claims Black people were better off under segregation, echoing recent statements from conservative commentators.\n\nPastor Shane Vaughn pushes the same theology, falsely claiming George Washington dedicated America as \u0022New Israel\u0022 and that all Declaration signers descended from Israeli tribes. The KKK wizard defines preserving the white race as Christianity\u0027s core mission, calling race \u0022the most valuable thing you have.\u0022\n\nThis isn\u0027t fringe anymore - these talking points are bleeding into mainstream politics. I break down the theology, expose the lies, and show you exactly how dangerous this movement has become.\n\n#ChristianNationalism #WhiteSupremacy #ReligiousExtremism\n\n\uD83D\uDD25 Support the Show:\nBecome a Patreon Member: https://owenmorgan.com/patreon\n\nRead my books:\n\uD83D\uDCD6 Was Hitler an Atheist? https://owenmorgan.com/whaa\n\uD83D\uDCD6 Understanding Jehovah\u0027\u0027s Witnesses: https://owenmorgan.com/ujw\n\n\uD83C\uDFA5 Watch on YouTube:\n\nTelltale: https://www.youtube.com/@OwenMorganTelltale\nTelltale Fireside Chat: https://www.youtube.com/@telltalefiresidechat\nTelltale Unfiltered: https://www.youtube.com/@telltaleunfiltered\nPixel Dreams: https://www.youtube.com/@owenpixeldreams\nTwitch: https://owenmorgan.com/twitch",

I\u0027m breaking down the Instagram account Pastors With Props that exposes these ridiculous sermons where preachers claim God puts extra fries in your bag and that giving them money makes you richer.\n\nFrom football-throwing pastors to bizarre slavery apologetics disguised as marriage advice, these mega church grifters are saying the quiet part loud. We\u0027re talking Kenneth Copeland-style prosperity gospel where your donations supposedly come back multiplied, classic manipulation tactics targeting vulnerable believers.\n\nThese aren\u0027t just embarrassing sermon moments - this is the playbook mega churches use to extract money from their congregations. When pastors start using props and entertainment instead of substance, you\u0027re watching a grift in action. The teddy bear sermon about \u0022releasing what\u0027s in your hand\u0022 is textbook prosperity gospel manipulation.\n\nCheck out my shop at OwenMorgan.com/shop for skeptic merch.\n\n#prosperitygospel #megachurch #religiousgrifters\n\n\uD83D\uDD25 Support the Show:\nBecome a Patreon Member: https://owenmorgan.com/patreon\n\nRead my books:\n\uD83D\uDCD6 Was Hitler an Atheist? https://owenmorgan.com/whaa\n\uD83D\uDCD6 Understanding Jehovah\u0027\u0027s Witnesses: https://owenmorgan.com/ujw\n\n\uD83C\uDFA5 Watch on YouTube:\n\nTelltale: https://www.youtube.com/@owenmorgantelltale\nTelltale Fireside Chat: https://www.youtube.com/@telltalefiresidechat\nTelltale Unfiltered: https://www.youtube.com/@telltaleunfiltered\nPixel Dreams: https://www.youtube.com/@owenpixeldreams\nTwitch: https://owenmorgan.com/twitch",

The video explores how biblical prophecy is often misinterpreted for political or social purposes, with a focus on evidence-based discussion rather than fear-mongering. We analyze the impact of such predictions on communities and discuss the importance of critical thinking when evaluating religious claims.

      "description": "Romana Didulo, the self-proclaimed \u201CQueen of Canada\u201D and leader of a dangerous QAnon-linked cult, has been arrested on weapons-related charges after her bizarre takeover of a small town. Her followers have long treated her as a monarch, obeying her so-called decrees and pledges of loyalty, but this time the law caught up with her.  \n\nIn this video, we break down what happened, why this arrest matters, and how her cult has spiraled into increasingly dangerous territory. From bizarre proclamations to armed standoffs, Didulo\u2019s story is a chilling reminder of how far extremist conspiracy movements can go.  \n#RomanaDidulo #QueenOfCanada #Cult #Arrested #QAnon #WeaponsCharges #Telltale #OwenMorgan\n\n\uD83D\uDD25 Support the Channel:  \n\nBecome a YouTube Member  \nPatreon: https://owenmorgan.com/patreon  \n\uD83D\uDCD6 Was Hitler an Atheist?
