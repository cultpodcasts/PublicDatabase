      "description": "Bethany Joy Lenz opens up with host, Patrick Custer, in this powerful interview where they discuss untapped, dynamic perspectives into her life\u2019s story. Bethany reflects on growing up in a conservative Christian household and discovering her passion for acting at a young age. She also shares her experience navigating the entertainment industry while being part of a high-demand religious group she now recognizes as a cult.\n\nAs they explore her experiences, Bethany opens up about the challenges of balancing fame during her time on One Tree Hill with the pressures of a controlling environment that blurred the lines between faith and manipulation. She shares deeply personal insights into the struggles of feeling disconnected from God, the weight of living up to others\u2019 expectations, and the process of reclaiming her sense of self.\n\nThe conversation touches on themes of coercion, healing from shame, and the transformative power of self-discovery. Bethany\u2019s story is an inspiring reminder of the freedom that comes with embracing authenticity and breaking free from the constraints of control.\n\nDon\u0027t forget to like, subscribe, and share your thoughts in the comments!\n\n\nWatch/Listen/Subscribe: \u2060\u2060@rootedrecoverystories \nInsta: \u2060@rootedrecoverystories  \nTiktok: @patrickcusterproject  \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/RootedRecoveryStories/\nURL: \u2060https://www.rootedrecoverystories.com\u2060\n\n__________________\n\nResources: \nInsta: \u2060@mentalhealthamerica  \nURL: https://\u2060www.mhanational.org\u2060 \n\nPromises Behavioral Health \u2013 Treatment for addiction, mental health/trauma: \nInsta: \u2060@promises_bh \nURL: \u2060https://www.promisesbehavioralhealth.com\u2060 \n\nFollow Patrick Custer!\nInsta: @patrick_custer  \nTiktok: @patrickcusterproject  \n\nFollow Bethany Joy Lenz!\nInsta: @msbethanyjoylenz\n\nAbout Bethany Joy Lenz:\nBethany Joy Lenz is an accomplished and award-winning actress and director.
