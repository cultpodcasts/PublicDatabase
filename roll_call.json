      "description": "Forty years ago Sunday, a young Jackie Speier was shot and left for dead on an airstrip in Guyana, after helping her boss \u2014 Rep. Leo Ryan \u2014 rescue 25 cult members from a deadly cult commune known as Jonestown. Ryan was shot and killed that day, shortly before more than 900 members of the commune died of self-inflicted cyanide poisoning.\n\nSpeier, who has been a member of Congress from California since 2008, joined Roll Call to listen to recently uncovered audio of an interview her former boss conducted with a cult escapee, just months before Ryan was killed in the so-called Jonestown massacre.\n\nWebsite: http://www.rollcall.com\nFollow us: http://www.twitter.com/RollCall\nLike us: http://www.facebook.com/RollCallDC\nGoogle\u002B: http://www.google.com/\u002BRollCall\nTumblr: http://photos.rollcall.com",

      "description": "Rep. Jackie Speier knows exactly how it feels to be left for dead.\n\nOn Nov. 18, 1978, she was shot five times on a remote airstrip in Guyana, South America. Her boss, Rep. Leo J. Ryan and four others lay dead nearby, killed by gunfire as they tried to escape Jonestown, the commune built by cult leader Jim Jones.\n\nNearly 40 years later, Speier still remembers why she decided to get on a plane to go down on the ill-fated congressional trip.\n\nWebsite: http://www.rollcall.com\nFollow us: http://www.twitter.com/RollCall\nLike us: http://www.facebook.com/RollCallDC\nGoogle\u002B: http://www.google.com/\u002BRollCall\nTumblr: http://photos.rollcall.com",
