      "description": "This week, we\u0027re talking about how sexuality can be used to coerce people in cultlike settings, through the lens of Ellen Huet\u0027s new book EMPIRE OF ORGASM: Sex, Power, and the Downfall of a Wellness Cult. Ellen joins DB to talk about OneTaste, a for-profit wellness company that was hit with allegations of coercion, forced labor, and other abusive practices. Listen in for the story of how Ellen dove into this story as an investigative journalist -- including the time she came face-to-face with the alleged perpetrators she was covering. CONTENT WARNINGS In this episode, we discuss allegations of sexual assault, coersion, grooming tactics, cults. These topics will be present throughout the entire conversation, so if this is something that hits a little too close to home or is too heavy to dive into right now, please take care of yourself.
