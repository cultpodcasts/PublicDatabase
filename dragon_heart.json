Also I am not a lawyer and am not providing any legal advice. I am sharing information that was shared with me by someone who knows about these disclosure agreements. This goes for The Digital Headquarters group, Open Form group and the Church of Union they have. \n\n\n- an employer cannot use an NDA to punish someone for revealing abuse\n\n- The NDA ONLY protects confidential information in the Digital Headquarters forum. It DOES NOT protect \u0022trade secrets\u0022 or client information. It does not protect private Facebook messages, emails, or shared Google documents. NOTHING outside the Digital Headquarters forum is protected.\n\n- In fact, a lot of what is in the Digital Headquarters forum is not protected either, if the information is being revealed for the purpose of showing abuse.\n\n- Jeff did not pay you for your work for his for-profit business. He was supposed to pay you minimum wage as set by the state of Michigan plus overtime, which he didn\u0027t. He cannot treat you like an employee and expect that he has the rights of an employer over you, BECAUSE HE NEVER EMPLOYED YOU.

Drama brings views and new viewers at that. I feel they are not as well off as they may claim and are looking at anyway to try to bring \u0027fresh meat\u0027 into the group for them to market and sell to. I feel that Jeff and Shaleia feel their walls starting to crumble and they do not know what to do .They are even wanting to and attempting to sue VICE for them writing the two articles they have on them. LOL. It\u0027s called freedom of speech! LOL. They are not used to not being able to control those who speak out against them. What they fail to understand is that more people are speaking out and things are coming to the light. \n\n\n\nThere is something brewing in TFU that is causing their boat to really rock the way it has been. More people are continuing to leave TFU who once believed in Jeff and Shaleia. If people that once truly believed in every word you said and everything you did are now leaving you, what does that say? \n\n\n\n\nFor those out there, you are free to share these videos in hopes that others will see it and be aware to what is really going on in this group.

      "description": "#twinflame #twinflamecult #twinflameuniverse #cult\n\n* Warning, Strong Language is used in this video.*\n\nSo this video is me expressing my feelings towards a video that was posted by a couple in TFU as to who they talk about the so called \u0027masculine\u0027 in the relationship needs to go out to buy men\u0027s clothing in order for her to be more comfortable in this role as a \u0027man\u0027 and take complete ownership of her \u0027masculine\u0027 energy. They state this is something that Jeff and Shealia are \u0022advising them to do\u0022 and that it is something they \u0022urgently should do\u0022  to help this so called \u0027masculine\u0027 woman adapt into this role. \n\nIt is later stated in this couples video that a possible sex change may be an option. As far as I know when these two women were in TFU starting out, they identified themselves as straight and Jeff and Shelia had confirmed for one of them if not both that their twin flames were men.\n\nJeff and Shelia later \u0022correct\u0022 themselves and inform these women that they are each others twin flame. I am part of the LGBTQ\u002B community and am fine with people loving who they want to love but these woman do not love each other romantically. The \u0027feminine\u0027 one in the couple keeps referring to the other woman as her \u0027man\u0027 and as \u0027he\u0027 to try and place this into their head that they need to be \u0027the man\u0027 in the relationship.\n\nFor Jeff and Shelia to state they are allies of the LGBTQ\u002B community yet manipulate and force people who they put in same sex relationships even though these people are not attracted to members of the same sex into changing who they are is not an ally. Also trying to change who someone is is not true love. \n\nIn the second video this couple makes the \u0027masculine\u0027 even breaks down in tears at one point. It does not seem that this woman wants to have HER identity decided for her or forced to be someone who she is not. She even states that Jeff states she should try to pick a more \u0022Urban Skater\u0022 style (Can\u0027t remember the exact name of the style, but close enough.)\n\n\n#LGBTQ #Samesextwinflame",
