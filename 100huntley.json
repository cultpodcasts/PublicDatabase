      "title": "Jonestown Survivors Spoke Out\u2014 Then They Were Killed",
      "description": "On April 24, 1980 \u2014 just a year and a half after the Jonestown tragedy \u2014 A documentary filmmaker sat down to recount firsthand experiences of one of the most shocking mass deaths in modern history. Some of the documentary interviewees had just been murdered in the weeks leading up to this rare interview. They describe life inside the Peoples Temple, the atmosphere leading up to November 18, 1978, and the chaotic final moments as over 900 men, women, and children lost their lives in a mass murder-suicide orchestrated by Jim Jones.\n\nThis conversation provides a stark, unfiltered look at the realities of Jonestown, the psychological hold Jim Jones had over his followers, and the few desperate attempts to escape.\n\nThis program is funded by the generous support of 100 Huntley Street viewers and is produced by Crossroads, a registered charity in Canada and the USA.
