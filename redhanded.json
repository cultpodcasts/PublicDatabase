But the British tabloids only cared about one thing: the wisecracking Southern belle Joyce McKinney made for great headlines.

      "description": "Last week, we looked at the formation of the ultra-obedient, bigamist Mormon cult, the FLDS \u2013 in which plural marriage to pregnant preteen girls is just the tip of the fundamentalist iceberg. In this second part, we look at how its new prophet, Warren Jeffs, took his so-called religion to ever stricter and more terrifying depths.  \n\nWith followers so beaten down that they were banned from even laughing; the prophet on the lam, living it up at Disneyland; and a team of ex-faithfuls and dogged investigators closing in \u2013 something had to give. But not before the full extent of his evil was laid bare in front of a stunned courtroom. \n\nFollow us on Instagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/redhandedthepod\n\nFollow us on TikTok\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/redhandedthepod\n\nAmazon Music\nhttps://music.amazon.co.uk/podcasts/903fa575-748d-4aa5-a682-8a5299e30ad1/redhanded\n\nApplePodcasts\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/redhanded/id1250599915\n\nWondery https://wondery.com/shows/redhanded/?queryID=86392c4da69560fc2d3ea3da63fca114",

But according to US law, he was a dangerous, totalitarian, child-molesting horror with over 80 wives \u2013 some married off as young as 12. Still, according to the church, Earthly laws are no match for the voice of God.\n\nIn this episode, we explore the story behind the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints: how the visions of a charismatic, seventeen-year-old farmhand grew to become a major world religion; how plural marriage caused a major rift in the church; and how its teachings were warped into a systematic cult of child abuse, underage sex, and absolute power.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.\n\nFollow us on Instagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/redhandedth...\n\nFollow us on TikTok\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@redhandedthepod\n\nAmazon Music\nhttps://music.amazon.co.uk/podcasts/9...\n\nApplePodcasts\nhttp://apple.co/redhandedPatreon:http...\n\nConnect with Wondery http://wondery.com/showshttp://facebo...\n\n#redhanded #truecrime #wondery #podcast #warrenjeffs #mormon #thebookofmormon  #truecrimepodcasts",
