      "description": "Gabby dives into the most chaotic religion story she\u2019s ever heard: a girl who got kicked out of a cult simply for not volunteering. Suddenly, there\u2019s Catholic guilt, Staten Island accents, childhood confusion, and zero actual witnessing of Jehovah. It\u2019s messy, unhinged, and way too relatable for anyone who\u2019s ever switched religions like outfits.\n\n #gabbybryan #standupcomedy #femalecomedy #standup #comedy #crowdwork\n\nDon\u0027t miss a video!
