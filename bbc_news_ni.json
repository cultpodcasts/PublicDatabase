      "description": "The Presbyterian Church in Ireland (PCI) is the biggest Protestant denomination in Northern Ireland, with more than 200,000 members across the island. \n\nAnd it has never had its moderator, or head of the church, resign in its 185-year history \u2013 until three weeks ago. \n\nThe announcement that Rev Trevor Gribben was stepping down due to serious safeguarding failings over a 13-year period, and that the police were starting a criminal investigation, has rocked the Church. \n\nFurther revelations in the days and weeks since have led to major questions \u2013 could there be a public inquiry? Can the Church\u2019s leaders restore confidence? And will people come forward with allegations of abuse that lay bare those safeguarding failings? \n\nAccording to BBC Talkback presenter William Crawley, they already are coming forward and this story could be just beginning. \n\nHe joined Declan in the studio to outline everything you need to know about the Presbyterian Church crisis so far and what could happen next.\n\n If you have been affected by any of these issues, there is support and information available at the BBC Action Line: https://bbc.in/4rB5Zw6 \n\nGet in touch: thestateofus@bbc.co.uk\n\n#northernireland #ireland #bbcnews #bbcnewsni #podcast #presbyterianchurch #presbyterianireland",
