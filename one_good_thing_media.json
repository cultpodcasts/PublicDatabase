      "description": "Welcome podcast lovers to another compelling episode of One Good Thing Media \u2014 your beacon of insightful conversations and uplifting reviews. Today\u0027s episode, \u0022Into the Light,\u0022 is especially riveting with a spicy blend of truth and\u00A0 no topic being\u00A0 taboo during an in-depth interview with Amanda and Kyle Briggs, co-hosts of \u0022The Cult I Left Behind\u201D podcast that\u2019s currently reverberating across the podverse.\u00A0During this interview, Amanda tells her remarkable journey from growing up under the control of the Institute of Basic Life Principles (IBLP) where education was skewed, personal autonomy was a foreign concept, and women bore an undue burden of responsibility for men\u0027s actions. Yet, it\u2019s through this lens of past oppression that Amanda\u0027s true story shines through as one of courage and self-discovery.\u00A0So dear listeners, let\u2019s all\u00A0 pour a cup of our favorite brew, kick back, and prepare to be mesmerized by what it was really\u00A0 like growing up in the IBLP.\u00A0 Listener caution is advised!CONTACTS for Amanda and KylePodcast:https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cult-i-left-behind/id1705661944Website:https://www.cultileftbehind.com/Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/people/The-Cult-I-Left-Behind/61551657642775/Instagram:https://www.instagram.com/cultileftbehind/www.onegoodthingmedia.comwww.facebook.com/onegoodthingmedia",
