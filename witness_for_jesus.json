I believe the Watchtower society are not teaching truth. Respectfully let\u0027s discuss these teachings. \n\nPoint 14 has been disputed by a JW.  Here is my video about that f\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jqfcrrorcE\n\nList of teachings refuted:\n1.  Jesus is not God\n2. Jesus is created and he is  \u201Ca god\u201D\n3. Jesus is only spoken of as an image of God in God\u2019s likeness \u2026.and this means he is not God\n4.  God shares his glory with Jesus because he exalted him\n5.  Jesus should not be worshipped\n6.  Jehovah created everything \u201Cthrough\u201D Jesus (both of them together)\n7.  We should not call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, we can only call on Jehovah\u2019s name\n8. Jesus is Michael the Archangel\n9.  There is only one Archangel called Michael \n10.  Jesus was born again at his baptism\n11.  Jesus was not raised bodily \n12.  Jesus was raised as a spirit\n13.  Jesus died to pay the price lost for Adam\u2019s sin only (a legal transaction)\n14.  Jesus suffered only to prove faithfulness\n15.  Our physical death pays for our sin Rom 6:23\n16  When Jesus ascended he was not king straight away.  He waited until 1914 to be king\n17.  Jesus only threw Satan out of heaven in 1914\n18.  Jesus Returned invisibly in 1914\n19.  We gain salvation by being in the JW organisation  \n20.  Good works are required for salvation, because Jam 2:24\n21.  True Christians are witnesses of Jehovah\n22.  Jesus was \u201Cmaking his Father\u2019s name known\u201D in the sense that he told the Jews that God\u2019s name is Jehovah\n23.  Jesus said go from house to house\n24.  Only the 144,000 will be in heaven\n25.  Only the 144,000 are the \u201Clittle flock\u201D spoken of by Jesus\n26.  The \u201Cother sheep\u201D are the believers who are not part of the 144,000 also called the \u201Cgreat crowd\u201D.\n27.  There is a heavenly hope and an earthly hope\n28.  Only the 144,000 \u201Canointed\u201D are part of the new covenant \n29   Only the anointed can partake of bread and wine \n30.  God has always worked through an organisation\n31.  The Faithful and discreet slave prefigures the Watchtower leaders\n32.  Proverbs 4:18 shows us that bible teachings can change\n33  It\u2019s important to dress cleanly and give a good impression outwardly\n34.  We must stick to the rules about blood even if somebody dies\n35.  When blood is mentioned in acts, it would include transfusing it into your body\n36.  Heaven (where God dwells) will be separate from earth forever\n37.  The Good news is that God\u2019s kingdom is going to bring a paradise and solve the world\u2019s problems",
