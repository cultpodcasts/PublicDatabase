      "title": "My Horrific Childhood in the CHILDREN OF GOD Sx Cult   (original video Cults to Consciousness)",
      "description": "My childhood was living hell\nMaybe thats why when I ran away I was drawn to horror novels by Steven King, the depravity, fear and gruesomeness of his writings were fictional, and, yet, I felt like I had experienced similar in real life\n\nThere was not a day in my childhood, that I didn\u0027t wish I was dead\n\nNow I\u0027m back for vindication. Help me meet out justice to those who committed these crimes against humanity before its too late\n\nMy abusers still walk free and do and abuse as they please. You can HELP\n\nShare my story, read my book, and be the change that this world needs\n\nhttps://www.philipseibel.com/books\n\nMy books are available in print and as ebooks in GERMAN AND ENGLISH at the above link (amazon) if the book says \u0022not for sale\u0022  you need to search your local amazon store\n\nComments from original interview\n\nAs a sexual abuse survivor, I feel for him.\n\n3 months ago\nHow is he nowadays? Non of the links are working... :(\nMY links can be found here philipseibel dot com... Youtube flags comments with links sadly so its hard to connect with others\n\n\nI hope you guys read this...i realize this is a year old.  Philip is such an inspiration - so resliliant!!!\nGood for you and being able to build a life.\n\nS\u00E5 trist\uD83D\uDE22\n\nWhat does ffing mean?\n\n@Philip-Seibel\nflirty fishing was a term coined by the cult leader to force women of the cult into prostitution you can read more here philipseibel dot com... I cant write the links otherwise Youtube will flag and delete the comments\n\nThank you for telling all of us that are not religios or in some kind of cult the real true.\nWe have been all to naive .\nI am sorry about that\n\nWhen he says :this is crime against humanity he is so true.\n\nDamn he was in a cult and living in Indian damn\n\n@Philip-Seibel\nhell on earth\n\nWhy were these creatures allowed to continue to operate under a new name? Beyond terrible.\n\n4 months ago\nI have to stop watching bc of the constant F word from your guest.\nReply\nGrow up! You being upset by cursing is the most ridiculous thing to feel and then feel entitled to say out loud and expect people to modify their behavior for the sake of your \u0022precious\u0022 feeling...all the while the ppl are talking about surviving the worst things imaginable...pls grow up and learn that the world doesn\u0027t revolve around you or particularly care for your feelings\n\nThe \u0022in detail\u0022 mentions of CSA was okay but god forbid someone uses a naughty word \uD83D\uDE12\n\n4 months ago\nThe justice system still has a long way to go to truly bring \u0022justice\u0022, which will never undo the horror of course, but at least something is done.... How these unspeakable crimes even occur is beyond me. I admire Philip and hats off to what he has become.\nI know a Thai person who speaks no Thai but cultish English via his parents involvement in COG.\nThankyou so much Philip, and lovely lady who runs these talks, for speaking out and daring to share your story so clearly, you are an inspiration. I am just amazed Philip at how together you are, and that you managed to marry and have a family yourself :)). I know how hard the process of speaking out is, especially if there has been so much scapegoating, manipulation, punishment for doing so. It\u0027s taking me years, I seem to do it in waves, each wave getting stronger. \n\nMy story is , I think, so less worse than yours ( or myb I don\u0027t remember all of mine, which is hard bc then I feel it\u0027s not valid, or my feelings and suffering hasn\u0027t been valid ).  \n\nFor me too I had sexual or sexualised abuses by my own mother, and for years, any time I tried to talk about it to anyone, even therapists, she was seen as the victim, and it felt like I was invalidated, as though woman can\u0027t possibly behave or do these things. So it\u0027s healing for me to hear you own your rage, and hear you talk about it so openly. For me it\u0027s the injustice too that burns the most. The imprint it\u0027s left in me has been a difficulty to really have relationships with healthy people, and I always swore I\u0027d never have children unless I could bring them into a healthy environment, so they wouldn\u0027t suffer as I did. I am happy I honoured that. But I have had so much to grieve over the life I never got to live, that I feel I deserved to have.\n\nI truly hope I can heal one day, and have a life and relationship that doesn\u0027t echo the one of my childhood. I believe I deserve it.\n\nThankyou both so much",

      "description": "Deutsche Beschreibung weiter unten\n\nIn this German video which i hope one day to make an English version of, I explain the propaganda tools that the cult used to recruit new members for their cause. In detail i explain how easy it can be for anyone to fall for the well rehearsed and polished lies that cult recruiters use to gain new followers, sponsors and donations\n\nMy name is Philip Seibel, a survivor of the notorious cult \u0022the children of god\u0022 in which I was born and raised\n\nAt the age of fifteen I had enough of the forced labor, sexual abuse, beatings and deprivation of speech and liberty and I ran away\n\nMy parents left me to die on the streets of Switzerland and soon after took my younger siblings to Africa. I would not see them again for almost ten years\n\nMy only instrument of survival was my voice and guitar\u2026 and lots of will power\n\nAs a former victim of child abuse, I try to make a difference by speaking out against the statutes of limitations. You can help by subscribing to my channel so that as many people as possible will know my story of abuse and survival after growing up in the cult aka the children of god which you can find in my diverse interviews and podcasts on this channel\n\nEver since my youtube channel was hacked and deleted I\u0027ve been re-uploading all my videos \n\nIf you want to know more about me go to my homepage www.philipseibel.com\n\nI am to this day self-employed and truly struggle to make ends meet.

Thank you for reading\n\n#stopchildabuse #survivalstory #sing with me #philip seibel #cult survivor\n\nIn diesem deutschen Video, von dem ich hoffe, dass ich eines Tages eine englische Version davon machen kann, erkl\u00E4re ich die Propagandamittel, die die Sekte einsetzte, um neue Mitglieder f\u00FCr ihre Sache zu gewinnen. Im Detail erkl\u00E4re ich, wie leicht es f\u00FCr jeden sein kann, auf die gut einstudierten und ausgefeilten L\u00FCgen hereinzufallen, mit denen Sektenanwerber neue Anh\u00E4nger, Sponsoren und Spenden gewinnen\n\nMein Name ist Philip Seibel, ein \u00DCberlebender der ber\u00FCchtigten Sekte \u201EDie Kinder Gottes\u201C, in der ich geboren und aufgewachsen bin\n\nIm Alter von f\u00FCnfzehn Jahren hatte ich genug von der Zwangsarbeit, dem sexuellen Missbrauch, den Schl\u00E4gen und dem Entzug von Rede- und Bewegungsfreiheit und lief weg\n\nMeine Eltern lie\u00DFen mich auf den Stra\u00DFen der Schweiz zum Sterben zur\u00FCck und nahmen meine j\u00FCngeren Geschwister bald darauf mit nach Afrika. Ich sollte sie fast zehn Jahre lang nicht wiedersehen\n\nMein einziges \u00DCberlebensinstrument war meine Stimme und meine Gitarre ... und viel Willenskraft\n\nAls ehemaliges Opfer von Kindesmissbrauch versuche ich, etwas zu bewirken, indem ich mich gegen die Verj\u00E4hrungsfristen ausspreche. Sie k\u00F6nnen helfen, indem Sie meinen Kanal abonnieren, damit m\u00F6glichst viele Menschen meine Geschichte von Missbrauch und \u00DCberleben erfahren, nachdem ich in der Sekte, auch bekannt als die Kinder Gottes, aufgewachsen bin. Sie finden sie in meinen verschiedenen Interviews und Podcasts auf diesem Kanal\n\nSeit mein YouTube-Kanal gehackt und gel\u00F6scht wurde, lade ich alle meine Videos erneut hoch \n\nWenn Sie mehr \u00FCber mich erfahren m\u00F6chten, besuchen Sie meine Homepage www.philipseibel.com\n\nIch bin bis heute selbstst\u00E4ndig und habe wirklich M\u00FChe, \u00FCber die Runden zu kommen. Ihr Kauf meiner Wearables, B\u00FCcher und Musik wird mir wirklich helfen, die Kosten f\u00FCr meine Produktionen und meinen Aktivismus zu decken. \n\nAuf meiner Homepage finden Sie auch Links zu Spendenm\u00F6glichkeiten.
