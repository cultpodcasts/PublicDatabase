      "description": "Join me for an interview with Special Guest Kresha Easton of @diffiCULTresearch  \n\n#lorivallowdaybell #doomsdaycultmom #lds\n\nKresha Easton is a member of the Woodcock family and a niece of Charles Vallow. As the aunt of JJ Vallow and cousin of Tylee Ryan, I am on a mission to seek justice by uncovering the troubling beliefs of my former aunt, Lori Vallow, and her husband, Chad Daybell. Throughout this journey, I\u2019ve encountered powerful individuals within the mainstream system, revealing the truths we\u2019ve been misled about. By subscribing to my channel, you can help amplify the voices of Tylee, JJ, Tammy, Charles, and Joe.\nJoin me in this critical endeavor to tell their stories and advocate for meaningful change in policy and prevention.
