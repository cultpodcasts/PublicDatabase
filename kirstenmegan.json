      "description": "Kirsten and Megan Discuss growing up LDS with their Mormon Cartoon book from 1978. \nIn the Book of Mormon, there are many stories about war and justifiable vigilante justice. \n\nEver read the Book of Mormon story where violence is somehow framed as spiritual leadership? Let\u2019s talk about Ammon, the missionary who cuts off a bunch of arms to impress King Lamoni and somehow ends up being the gold standard for faith, obedience, and righteousness.\n\nIn this video, we break down one of the wildest Book of Mormon stories\u2014where extreme violence is rewarded, shock value equals conversion, and nobody seems bothered by the pile of severed arms. Why was this story taught to us as inspirational? Why were we expected to admire it? And why does it feel more like ancient propaganda than divine morality?\n\nIf you were raised Mormon, ex-Mormon, or are just fascinated by religious stories that don\u2019t age well, this one\u2019s for you. Snark included. Critical thinking encouraged. Arms\u2026 definitely unnecessary.\n\n\uD83C\uDFA5 Watch as we unpack:\n \u2022 The Ammon arm-cutting story\n \u2022 Why violence = righteousness in Mormon scripture\n \u2022 How shock tactics were framed as \u201Cfaith-building\u201D\n \u2022 Why this story hits VERY differently once you\u2019re out\n\n\u2E3B\n\nBook of Mormon, Ammon cuts off arms, King Lamoni, Lamanites, Mormon scripture, LDS church history, ex Mormon commentary, Mormon stories explained, problematic Bible stories, religious trauma, deconstruction, ex mormon comedy, ex mormon humor, family home evening, mormon stories, Book of Mormon\n\n#ExMormon #BookOfMormon #MormonHistory #Deconstruction #ReligiousTrauma #MormonStories #ExMoTikTok #FaithCrisis #CultRecovery #Snark #LDSChurch",

      "description": "Back in the beginning of the LDS church, Joseph Smith appointed his father \u0022Patriarch\u0022 over the church. Joe Sr. Charged anywhere from $1 to $5 to give people a special blessing, which was supposed to help them get a peek into the future. This practice later evolved into a sort of \u0027roadmap\u0027, with leaders encouraging youth as young as 12 to get their Patriarchal Blessing as a guide to future decision making. \n\nPatriarchal blessings are supposed to be deeply personal, divinely inspired roadmaps for your life\u2014but what happens when you actually read them years later?\n\nIn this video, we share and discuss our own Mormon patriarchal blessings and unpack how they were framed as sacred guidance, yet ended up being vague, manipulative, and strangely interchangeable. We talk about how these blessings often rely on ambiguity, conditional promises, and fear-based obedience\u2014while convincing members that they are uniquely chosen and personally known by God.\n\nWe explore how patriarchal blessings can:\n \u2022 Feel incredibly specific at first\u2026 until you compare them\n \u2022 Place responsibility on the individual when \u201Cpromises\u201D don\u2019t come true\n \u2022 Reinforce obedience, conformity, and authority\n \u2022 Create pressure, guilt, and self-blame instead of clarity\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered why your patriarchal blessing didn\u2019t actually guide your life\u2014or why it somehow made you feel like you were the problem\u2014this conversation is for you.\n\nWhether you\u2019re ex-Mormon, questioning, or just curious about high-demand religions, this video dives into the psychology behind why patriarchal blessings feel powerful\u2026 and why that power fades once you step back and look critically.\n\n\uD83D\uDCAC Share in the comments: Did your patriarchal blessing come true?
