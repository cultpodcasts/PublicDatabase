      "title": "Episode 127: Inside the Twelve Tribes Cult: How Tamara Mathieu Survived 14 Years",
      "description": "Zach Randles-Friedman speaks with author and TikTok creator Tamara Mathieu, who spent 14 years inside the Twelve Tribes, a high-control religious cult with communities across the U.S. and around the world. Tamara shares how she was drawn in as a young mother seeking community and safety, what daily life inside the cult really looked like, and how strict rules, isolation, and control shaped her marriage and her children\u2019s lives. She opens up about motherhood under surveillance, the loss of personal freedom, the impact on teenagers, and the slow realization that something was deeply wrong. In a gripping and emotional conversation, Tamara recounts the moment she and her family finally escaped, the challenges of rebuilding life afterward, and how her children have gone on to thrive outside the cult. She also discusses her memoir, All Who Believe: A Memoir in the Life of the Twelve Tribes, and why sharing her story now helps others feel less alone. This episode is an honest, courageous look at survival, deconstruction, and reclaiming your life after spiritual abuse.
