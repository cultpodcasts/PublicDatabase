Listen as Rachael and Cameron catch up with what\u0027s been going on in their lives, talk about the election and dive into project 2025... What is Project 2025, and why is it sparking controversy? In this episode, we critically examine the conservative movement\u2019s bold plan to reshape America\u2019s future. Project 2025 outlines a sweeping agenda to transform federal government policies, dismantle regulations, and enforce conservative ideals across social, economic, and political spheres. Critics warn it could undermine democratic institutions, erode civil liberties, and deepen societal divides. We unpack the key components of this ambitious plan, explore its potential consequences, and ask the pressing question: Is Project 2025 a roadmap to reform\u2014or a blueprint for disaster?

      "description": "TW: Sex trafficking Sound of freedom hit theaters July 4th and it is an independent action film directed by Alejandro Monteverde. The story is about Tim Ballard. He is a former Department of Homeland Security agent and the founder and former CEO of Operation Underground Railroad (O.U.R.) an anti-sex trafficking organization. Sound of freedom tells Tim Ballard\u0027s story of his Operation Triple Take, a joint action between OUR and the Colombian government that reportedly rescued 123 trafficked people\u201455 of whom were children. So why are we talking about this? Sounds like a good story, right?Well Ballard is not all he\u0027s cracked up to be. Ballard and OUR aren\u2019t actually central to the international fight against human trafficking. The majority of the [anti-trafficking] field views them as fringe. They\u2019re on the outs of this genre. They like to sell sensationalism\u2026and they fundraise off it. Because Christians love that shit.Cynane and I discuss the new Sound of Freedom movie, Qanon, Jim Caviezel, Tim Ballard, OUR organization, sex trafficking, and much more.

In this episode we cover PTSD, the difference between religious trauma and other trauma, and most importantly how do we heal. Andrew Jasko, M.Div., MA Counseling Psychology in progress, is a former Princeton Seminary educated minister. He left his religious faith and community because of the severe psychological trauma he experienced. After spending years and thousands of dollars healing his trauma and helping hundreds of people transform their lives, He is considered an expert in healing religious trauma.

We talk about sex, masturbation, Christian bands that promoted purity, and oppressing our individual personalities.
