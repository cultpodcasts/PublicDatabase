      "description": "You Were Always Right: Watching a Cult Collapse\nHey. If you\u0027ve ever been hurt by the NIFB or any group like it, this one\u0027s for you.\nYesterday, Steven Anderson posted tweets that proved everything you\u0027ve ever said about the hypocrisy, the theology, and the dysfunction.\nYou don\u0027t have to argue anymore. You don\u0027t have to prove anything.\nHe did it himself. Publicly. Permanently.\nThis isn\u0027t shock content. This is vindication content.\nThis is me, sitting with you, with snacks and teddy bears, watching a cult implode under its own weight\u2014just like you always knew it would.\nYou were right. You were always right. And now it\u0027s undeniable.\nTOPICS COVERED:\n\nWhy healthy coping (like comfort objects) is nothing like hypocrisy\nThe tweets that contradicted 20 years of preaching\nThe theological irony even innocent observers could see\nWhy you don\u0027t have to fight anymore\nCelebrating vindication and freedom\n\nIf this resonates with you, subscribe. Share with someone who needs to hear: \u0022You were right.\u0022\nStay soft. Stay safe. Hug your teddy bears.\n\u2014Lionel (and Monsieur Lapin) \uD83D\uDC30\n#ExNIFB #CultRecovery #YouWereRight #Vindication #SpiritualAbuse #ExFundamentalist #ReligiousTrauma #HealingJourney #ComfortContent #FreedomFromCults #NIFBParody #EventZero #TruthWins #NIFB #FWBC",
