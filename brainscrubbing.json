      "description": "Why do people ask if Goenka Vipassana is a cult?\n\nThis video examines Goenka-style Vipassana 10 day courses meditation through the lens of high-control systems, using established psychological and sociological frameworks \u2014 including Steven Hassan\u2019s BITE Model and research on isolation, repetition, and suggestibility.\n\nThis is not an attack on meditation, and it is not a claim about intent.\nMany people report Vipassana as grounding, meaningful, and beneficial.\n\nAt the same time, others report distress, confusion, or psychological difficulty \u2014 particularly in highly controlled retreat environments involving silence, isolation, and exhaustion.\n\nRather than arguing over labels, this documentary asks simpler questions:\n\nHow is the environment structured?\n\nHow is behavior, information, and interpretation shaped?\n\nWhy does the \u201Ccult question\u201D keep coming up \u2014 quietly, repeatedly \u2014 among participants?\n\nThe analysis focuses on structure and impact, not belief, and draws directly from:\n\nthe official Vipassana Code of Discipline\n\npeer-reviewed research on sensory restriction and influence\n\nfirst-person reports and documented concerns\n\nSources \u0026 References\n\nPrimary Materials\n\nCode of Discipline for Vipassana Courses\n(Source: Official Vipassana / Dhamma.org website \u2014 publicly available retreat guidelines)\n\nPsychological \u0026 Sociological Frameworks\n\nHassan, S.
