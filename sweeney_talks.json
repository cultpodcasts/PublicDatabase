Elgen\u2019s parents became members in their twenties and Elgen and his siblings were born into the Unification Church. Elgen tells John Sweeney what it was like to grow up as a Moonie and what led him to leave not once, but twice.",

But he\u2019s viewed by many as unconvincing. In this episode we look at what possible favours passed between those allegedly involved?",
