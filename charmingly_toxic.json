      "description": "In this episode we discuss the dynamics of the Plath family and explore themes of family influence, the struggles of the children, particularly Ethan and Mariah, and the impact of parenting styles on their development. The discussion delves into Olivia\u0027s role in Ethan\u0027s life, the cult-like dynamics of the family, and the financial control exerted by Kim. The conversation concludes with reflections on the future of the Plath children and the toxicity present in their relationships.\n\n\uD83D\uDC49 \u0022They all get pulled back to the cult.\u0022\n\n\uD83D\uDC49 \u0022What parent wants that?\u0022\n\nAlong the way, we connect the dots between reality TV drama and real-life relational patterns\u2014exploring how power, narcissism, and control show up both on screen and off.\n\nConnect with Me\n\uD83D\uDCF8 Instagram: @denise_supportcoaching\n\n\uD83D\uDCD8 Facebook: Denise Capurso Counseling and Coaching\n\n\uD83C\uDF99\uFE0F Charmingly Toxic is for entertainment and education.
