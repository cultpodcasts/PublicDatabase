      "description": "In this episode, we dive into the messy layers of Diddy\u2019s career\u2014everything from the manipulation and power plays to how his upbringing shaped the chaos that followed. We talk about the cult\u2011like environment he built, the complicated roles people like Kirk played as both victims and enablers, and the violent rivalries that fueled the industry. We also get into what Diddy\u2019s legacy looks like now and how public perception might shift as more comes to light. Along the way, we connect the dots between reality TV drama and real-life relational patterns\u2014exploring how power, narcissism, and control show up both on screen and off.
