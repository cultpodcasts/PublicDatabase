      "description": "What does it feel like to lose your voice and what does it take to reclaim it?\n\nFabled\u2019s first guest is a key contributor to the BBC World of Secrets podcast \u2018The Bad Guru\u2019, and the subject of an upcoming documentary series exposing the truth behind a yoga retreat that promised healing but delivered something far more sinister.\n\nJoin us for an intimate and powerful conversation with Miranda Grace - cult whistleblower, somatic practitioner and founder of Gracefull Awakenings - as she shares her story of survival, awakening, and healing after escaping the Tara Yoga Cult.\n\nIn conversation with Fabled\u2019s Founder, Miranda will share the subtle ways coercive control can show up - especially under the banner of wellness, spirituality and self-betterment -how cult dynamics operate in the body as much as the mind, and the journey of rebuilding self-trust and reclaiming inner authority.\n\nMiranda is a trafficking survivor, whistleblower and advocate for coercive control education and legal change. She\u2019s an activist for reclaiming our body, our voice and our joy as a survivor. Currently, she\u2019s fighting legal battles against the Atman Federation and Misa cult in multiple countries as part of her quest for healing, justice and positive change.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a conversation about survival: it\u2019s about sovereignty, voice, and what it means to come home to yourself on the other side.",
