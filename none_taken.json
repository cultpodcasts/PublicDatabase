      "title": "Uriah Wesman Survives Three Cults",
      "description": "#342 This week we had a conversation with comedian and storyteller Uriah Wesman. Uriah grew up in 3 cults by the time he was 14. We talk about cult vs religion, crisis of faith, mental health, the \u0022charismatic leader\u0022, and what it takes to shed a cult mentality. Oddly enough Raytheon and Sir Lancelot comes up. You can see Uriah\u0027s one man show \u0022Three Cults Walk Into A Bar\u0022 at the Lyric Hyperion in Los Angeles on May 11th. Follow him on IG @uriahjokes and here on YT @UriahWesman for more details. https://patreon.com/NoneTakenPod?utm_medium=clipboard_copy\u0026utm_source=copyLink\u0026utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator\u0026utm_content=join_link --- Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/none-taken/support",
