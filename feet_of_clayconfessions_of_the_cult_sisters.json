In a former life, he was a high-profile Pentecostal preacher, in Australia\u2019s megachurches such as Hillsong. His autobiography, \u2018A Life of Unlearning\u2019, became a bestseller and now in its third edition. The memoir details Anthony\u2019s rise to prominence and his several decades long struggle with homosexuality including constant prayer, counselling, fasting, conversion \u201Ctherapy\u201D, exorcisms and marriage, trying NOT to be gay. A chance encounter shattered the wall of denial he\u2019d built and thrust him through a maze of public scandal, rejection, isolation, and trauma. People often say it\u2019s a miracle he survived. Since 2004, his book, writing and organisations have been a source of resolution and healing. Anthony has worked with over 4,000 conversion \u201Ctherapy\u201D survivors and many more individuals experiencing faith/sexuality conflict. Anthony is the founder and CEO of Ambassadors \u0026 Bridge Builders International. He has been recognised for his contribution several times, including being twice voted one of the 25 Most Influential Gay and Lesbian Australians and in 2020 was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for his service to the LGBTQ community. Another claim to fame is that in 2008, along with Heath Ledger, Darren Hayes and Peter Allen, Anthony was named one of Australia\u2019s Poster Children for Sin by the infamous Rev Fred Phelps from the Westboro (God Hates Fags) Baptist Church. Much of Anthony\u2019s work came together recently when he worked with survivors and the state government to see legislation pass banning conversion \u0022therapy\u0022. https://www.instagram.com/feetofclay.cultsisters https://feetofclayconfessionsofthecultsisters.buzzsprout.com We love acronyms -- and we aren\u0027t afraid to use them!

      "description": "Loren Cunningham, founder of Youth With A Mission (YWAM), passed away on October 6, 2023.\u00A0 News of his passing was particularly difficult for MANY former members (YWAMers) because he escaped a long-overdue reckoning to account for the years of exploitation, manipulation, and spiritual and financial abuse he designed and presided over throughout the decades of Youth With A Mission\u2019s history.\u00A0 Tracey and Sharon share their own experiences with this systemic model of abuse and manipulation due to the close ties between Keith Green and Loren Cunningham and between Last Days Ministries and Youth With a Mission back in the early 1980\u2019s.\u00A0 Loren Cunningham exploited both youth and nations with a program that functioned much more like a multi-level marketing scheme (MLM) than a true ministry. We share the dark side of his\u00A0 \u2018legacy\u2019 that you won\u2019t often hear because Loren Cunningham and other high-level YWAM leaders worked hard to remove and silence people and bury and hide important and heart-breaking stories of abuse and corruption.\u00A0\u00A0References for this episode: Tyler Morning Telegraph Newspaper article\u00A0 \u2013 History of Ministries in East Texashttps://tylerpaper.com/lifestyle/faith/christian-pioneers-make-east-texas-a-hub-for-worldwide-ministries/article_3bfb0beb-9f0a-578c-8236-8549236a5233.htmlThe Cross and the Switch Blade Movie Trailer starring Erik Estrada (who starred in the TV Show CHiPs in the 1970\u2019s)https://youtu.be/w4ANAyIQi8Y?si=YWzERVCizDfyYFdpThe Book used by YWAM to emphasize the principle \u2013 \u201CDo not come against God\u2019s anointed.\u201DThe Tale of Three Kings\u2013 by Gene Edwards\u00A0Sharon mentions visiting the home of the Anastasis Ship in 1982: \u00A0Loren Cunningham had a long-time vision of a ship ministry, which was finally realized in 1979.
