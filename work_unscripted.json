      "description": "Is your workplace truly supportive\u2014or are you caught in something more manipulative than you realize?\nIn this solo episode, Marlo Lyons breaks down the difference between a healthy company culture and a full-blown company cult. From love bombing new hires to rewarding blind loyalty over actual performance, Marlo unpacks the subtle emotional manipulation tactics that can trap even the most high-performing professionals. She shares red flags to watch for, including over-identification with the company, fear of leadership, and transparency that\u2019s more performative than real.\nWhether you\u0027re feeling disillusioned at work or fiercely loyal to your team, this episode will help you pause and evaluate your loyalty, your well-being, and what you truly want from your career. Because a good company earns your respect\u2014it doesn\u2019t demand your worship.\n\n\nConnect with Marlo Website | LinkedIn | Instagram \n-----------\nWork Unscripted is produced by the team at Palm Tree Pod Co.",
