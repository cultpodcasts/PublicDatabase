      "description": "In 2001, a Texas woman drowned five of her children one by one. The horrors shocked the nation. Some ridiculed her and called her a \u201Cbeast,\u201D but the case wasn\u2019t as clear-cut as it first appeared. Not only had Andrea Yates been diagnosed with post-partum depression and postpartum psychosis, but she also may have been strongly influenced by a violent, misogynistic doomsday Christian cult leader. Through letters, cassettes, and VHS tapes, Michael Woroniecki spiritually manipulated his followers into thinking that if they didn\u2019t change their ways, especially their children\u2019s ways, their entrance to Hell was fast approaching. Did Andrea brutally murder her children in cold blood because of post partum psychosis, or had she been convinced she was saving her children from eternal damnation?\n\nLights Out Merch: https://milehighermerch.com/\nHigher Hope Foundation: https://higherhope.org\n\nFollow \u0026 Subscribe To The Show!\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/3SfSNbkVrfz3ceXmNr0lZ4\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lights-out/id1505843600\n\n00:00 - What\u0027s Up Everybody\n4:54 - Andrea \u0026 Rusty Yates\n18:39 - Murders\n34:36 - The Cult Grows\n1:07:25 - Michael and the Yates Family\n1:21:53 - Trial\n1:31:17 - Another Trial\n1:49:54 - Conclusion\n\nSocial Links:\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@lightsoutcast\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/lightsoutcast\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/lightsoutcast\n\nSuggestions/Comments: lop@milehigher.com\nMerch: https://lightsoutcast.shop/\nRequest A Topic Form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeOikdybNMOzpHIjLy0My2fYF0LXgN3NXDC0BQNFNNSXjetpg/viewform?usp=sharing\nPodcast sponsor inquires: adops@audioboom.com\n\nHost: Josh\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/milehigherjosh\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/milehigherjosh\n\nWriter/Co-host: Austin\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/austin_leee_/\n\nEditor/Producer: Daniel\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/horrororeo\n\nCreator hosts a documentary series for educational purposes (EDSA).
