She starts spouting anti-trans talking points, talking about anti-white racism and attacking the Democratic Party. Our guest writer is Mike Prysner (Empire Files, Eyes Left Podcast) who helps us explore Tulsi Gabbard, the cult that she grew up in, and how she gelled as a right wing figure, palling up with Tucker Carlson and the Indian far-right.

      "description": "Michael Flynn recently recited one of their prayers. But the I AM Cult goes all the way back to the 70s and beyond \u2014 thanks to theosophist Helena Blavatsky.
