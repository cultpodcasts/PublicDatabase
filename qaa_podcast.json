      "description": "Have you ever wondered what it\u2019d be like to erase negative thoughts, win every argument, and close every sale? Travis and Brad take you through the sordid tale of a self-help movement that\u2019s equal parts psychotherapy, entrepreneurial success tool, and mind-control technique. A movement that inspired the likes of Tony Robbins, NXIVM, the Landmark corporate cult, and even pick-up artistry. A modality used by IBM and McDonald\u2019s, the U.S. Army and the CIA. A quasi-religion that was poised to be as big as Scientology, if it hadn\u2019t been for a series of self-inflicted wounds. Your brain is a computer, and we\u2019re about to install the story of Neuro-linguistic Programming.
