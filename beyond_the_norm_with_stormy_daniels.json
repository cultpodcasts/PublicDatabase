      "description": "My next on guest on Beyond the Norm is famed cult de-programmer Dr. Steven Hassan. He has spent the past 45 years rescuing people from the clutches of some of this nation\u2019s most notorious cults and has of late found himself rescuing those afflicted with Trumpism and its various offshoots from QAnon to various extremist groups. A mental health counselor, Hassan flies around the country to hold interventions with cult victims, enabling them to take back their minds and lives. In 2019, Hassan published The Cult of Trump, a book that laid out what he sees as the former president\u2019s cult-leader tendencies and offered advice for the families of Trump extremists. Hassan joins me today as Trump continues to leverage his stranglehold over the GOP for domination while pressuring those who will not bow to his presence to leave the party. This interview is a long time coming and will answer many of your most burning questions of how it\u2019s possible for someone to lose their mind to Donald Trump.",
