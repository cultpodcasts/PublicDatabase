The world was ending and she would be saved, spirited away to Venus with the rest of her enormous and enlightened family. The prophecy failed. Instead of collapsing, the cult she was being raised in carried on. But Guinevere would soon find herself thrown out into the world beyond, where things somehow became more nightmarish than before. In this episode, Guinevere Turner joins us to talk about her remarkable memoir, When the World Didn\u0027t End . Buy the Book. Read Guinevere\u0027s piece in The New Yorker that led to her memoir .
