      "description": "One of America\u2019s leading experts in cults and mind-control provides an eye-opening analysis of Trump and the indoctrination tactics he uses to build a fanatical devotion in his supporters. Over the past two years, Trump\u2019s behaviour has become both more disturbing and yet increasingly familiar. He relies on phrases like, \u201Cfake news,\u201D \u201Cbuild the wall,\u201D and continues to spread the divisive mentality of us-vs.-them. He lies constantly, has no conscience, never admits when he is wrong, and projects all of his shortcomings on to others. He has become more authoritarian, more outrageous, and yet many of his followers remain blindly devoted. Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert and a major Trump supporter, calls him one of the most persuasive people living. His need to squash alternate information and his insistence of constant ego stroking are all characteristics of other famous leaders\u2014cult leaders. In The Cult of Trump, mind-control and licensed mental health expert Steven Hassan draws parallels between our current president and people like Jim Jones, David Koresh, Ron Hubbard and Sun Myung Moon, arguing that this presidency is in many ways like a destructive cult. He specifically details the ways in which people are influenced through an array of social psychology methods and how they become fiercely loyal and obedient. Hassan was a former \u201CMoonie\u201D himself, and he draws on his forty years of personal and professional experience studying hypnosis and destructive cults, working as a deprogrammer, and a strategic communications interventionist. He emphasizes why it\u2019s crucial that we recognize ways to identify and protect ourselves and our loved ones. The Cult of Trump is an accessible and in-depth analysis of the president, showing that under the right circumstances, even sane, rational, well-adjusted people can be persuaded to believe the most outrageous ideas. Hassan\u2019s book is essential reading for anyone wanting to understand the Trump phenomenon and looking for a way forward. https://amzn.to/4lGjEic Become a supporter of this podcast: https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/the-opperman-report--1198501/support .",

      "description": "From the back cover: The snake stuffed in attorney Paul Morantz s mailbox by acolytes of Synanon, a once-hailed drug rehabilitation center that had devolved into a paranoid, militaristic cult, was an early strike in what would become a 35-year war with nearly every major cult movement this country has ever known. Mr. Morantz has been involved under frequently bizarre circumstances--with such infamous sects as the Charles Manson family, Patty Hearst and the SLA, Jim Jones and the People s Temple, the Moonies and the strange world of Scientology. His efforts have helped many escape from lives of torment and contributed to a sea change in how courts deal with the little-understood issues of brainwashing and cults. Now, in this important and compelling book, Mr. Morantz offers a comprehensive account of the origins and activities of cults and how they prey on society s most vulnerable elements. It also recounts the very intimate tale of how these confrontations with threatening and often, violent forces cost him the woman he loved and nearly, life itself. https://amzn.to/4m04DYj Become a supporter of this podcast: https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/the-opperman-report--1198501/support .",

      "description": "On August 10, 1977, the NYPD arrested David Berkowitz for the Son of Sam murders that had terrorized New York City for over a year. Berkowitz confessed to shooting sixteen people and killing six with a .44 caliber Bulldog revolver, and the case was officially closed. Journalist Maury Terry was suspicious of Berkowitz\u2019s confession. Spurred by conflicting witness descriptions of the killer and clues overlooked in the investigation, Terry was convinced Berkowitz didn\u2019t act alone. Meticulously gathering evidence for a decade, he released his findings in the first edition of The Ultimate Evil. Based upon the evidence he had uncovered, Terry theorized that the Son of Sam attacks were masterminded by a Yonkers-based cult that was responsible for other ritual murders across the country. After Terry\u2019s death in 2015, documentary filmmaker Josh Zeman (Cropsey, The Killing Season, Murder Mountain) was given access to Terry\u2019s files, which form the basis of his docuseries with Netflix and a companion podcast.

      "description": "Arnaldo Lerma - Scientology Cult The late Arnaldo Lerma joined the Opperman Report to discuss Scientology. How it works, how it threatens and how it\u0027s influence is more and more a subtext for our times.Ever heard the story of Xenu, the genocidal alien dictator who, when faced with overpopulation troubles 75 million years ago, brought billions of his subjects to Earth to execute with a lethal combination of volcanoes and hydrogen bombs? Their disembodied spirits to cling to humans and their removal can only be achieved through the teachings of the Church of Scientology? If so, you can thank Arnie Lerma.Arnaldo Pagliarini Lerma was born in Washington, D.C., in 1950, to a mother who was an executive secretary to the Sudanese ambassador and a father who was a Mexican agriculture official \u2014 and who divorced months after his birth, according to Lerma\u0027s autobiography. His mother was a Scientology official in the D.C. church around 1968, about three decades after American science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard published the first texts that would form the basis of his new religion, Scientology. By the time Lerma joined Scientology at 16 at the urging of his mother, the church had been banned in several Australian states and stripped of its tax-exempt status by the IRS, which deemed it a commercial operation for Hubbard\u0027s benefit \u2014 though a U.S. appeals court later recognized it as a religion in 1969.

He holds a doctoral degree from Emory University, and has been a repeat guest on various TV and radio programs. His previous eight books have garnered widespread positive reviews.The Culture of Cults\nOur current malaise raises questions:\n\u2022 Are we all soul-stained with selfishness... or is it just a\nhealthy survival instinct?\n\u2022 Where is the line between normal self-interest and full-\nblown Narcissism?\n\u2022 How do we distinguish strong leadership from\nmanipulation? Community from Cult?\nDrawing upon court cases and real world experiences, this book shows how cult gurus and \u201Ccult cultures\u201D fit a predictable pattern, a common template of destructive traits and tactics. By studying Cult Culture, the author argues, we gain insight into current politics and Fascist demagogues.\nFirst relating his own encounter with disillusioned cult members, author Lance Moore dissects the phenomena, exposing the methods of manipulation found in cult leaders \u2014and on a smaller scale, in our own relationships.\n\nThis book is well-researched: it includes over 500 endnotes citing 500 Sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecome a supporter of this podcast: https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/the-opperman-report--1198501/support.",

      "title": "When Men Become Gods: Mormon Polygamist Warren Jeffs, His Cult of Fear, and the Women Who Fought Back",
      "description": "New York Times bestselling author Stephen Singular provides an inside look at the Mormon polygamist sect that made headlines in 2008 for coercing young girls into marriage, and the story of their ruthless leader, Warren Jeffs. As the self-proclaimed prophet of the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints, Warren Jeffs held sway over thousands of followers for nearly a decade. His rule was utterly tyrannical. In addition to coercing young girls into marriages with older men, Jeffs reputedly took scores of wives, many of whom were his father\u0027s widows. But in 2007, after landing on the FBI\u0027s Ten Most Wanted List, Jeffs\u0027s reign was forcefully ended. He would be imprisoned for committing rape as an accomplice. In When Men Become Gods, Edgar Award\u2013nominee Stephen Singular traces Jeffs\u0027s rise to power and the concerted effort that led to his downfall. Newly updated, it describes the controversial 2008 raid on Jeffs\u0027s Texas compound and the fate of the 439 children taken from the sect. It offers readers a rare glimpse into a tradition that\u0027s almost a century old, but has only now been exposed.
