      "description": "Arnaldo Lerma - Scientology Cult The late Arnaldo Lerma joined the Opperman Report to discuss Scientology. How it works, how it threatens and how it\u0027s influence is more and more a subtext for our times.Ever heard the story of Xenu, the genocidal alien dictator who, when faced with overpopulation troubles 75 million years ago, brought billions of his subjects to Earth to execute with a lethal combination of volcanoes and hydrogen bombs? Their disembodied spirits to cling to humans and their removal can only be achieved through the teachings of the Church of Scientology? If so, you can thank Arnie Lerma.Arnaldo Pagliarini Lerma was born in Washington, D.C., in 1950, to a mother who was an executive secretary to the Sudanese ambassador and a father who was a Mexican agriculture official \u2014 and who divorced months after his birth, according to Lerma\u0027s autobiography. His mother was a Scientology official in the D.C. church around 1968, about three decades after American science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard published the first texts that would form the basis of his new religion, Scientology. By the time Lerma joined Scientology at 16 at the urging of his mother, the church had been banned in several Australian states and stripped of its tax-exempt status by the IRS, which deemed it a commercial operation for Hubbard\u0027s benefit \u2014 though a U.S. appeals court later recognized it as a religion in 1969.

      "description": "Larry Moore - Cults on Trial - A Cross-Examination of Jim Jones, Charles Manson, Hitler\u2026 and Donald Trump\n\nMay 6, 2024\n\nDr. Moore is a Pre-Sentence Investigator for Alabama Circuit Courts, with previous careers as an ordained pastor, college educator, and author. He holds a doctoral degree from Emory University, and has been a repeat guest on various TV and radio programs. His previous eight books have garnered widespread positive reviews.The Culture of Cults\nOur current malaise raises questions:\n\u2022 Are we all soul-stained with selfishness... or is it just a\nhealthy survival instinct?\n\u2022 Where is the line between normal self-interest and full-\nblown Narcissism?\n\u2022 How do we distinguish strong leadership from\nmanipulation? Community from Cult?\nDrawing upon court cases and real world experiences, this book shows how cult gurus and \u201Ccult cultures\u201D fit a predictable pattern, a common template of destructive traits and tactics. By studying Cult Culture, the author argues, we gain insight into current politics and Fascist demagogues.\nFirst relating his own encounter with disillusioned cult members, author Lance Moore dissects the phenomena, exposing the methods of manipulation found in cult leaders \u2014and on a smaller scale, in our own relationships.\n\nThis book is well-researched: it includes over 500 endnotes citing 500 Sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecome a supporter of this podcast: https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/the-opperman-report--1198501/support.",

      "description": "New York Times bestselling author Stephen Singular provides an inside look at the Mormon polygamist sect that made headlines in 2008 for coercing young girls into marriage, and the story of their ruthless leader, Warren Jeffs. As the self-proclaimed prophet of the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints, Warren Jeffs held sway over thousands of followers for nearly a decade. His rule was utterly tyrannical. In addition to coercing young girls into marriages with older men, Jeffs reputedly took scores of wives, many of whom were his father\u0027s widows. But in 2007, after landing on the FBI\u0027s Ten Most Wanted List, Jeffs\u0027s reign was forcefully ended. He would be imprisoned for committing rape as an accomplice. In When Men Become Gods, Edgar Award\u2013nominee Stephen Singular traces Jeffs\u0027s rise to power and the concerted effort that led to his downfall. Newly updated, it describes the controversial 2008 raid on Jeffs\u0027s Texas compound and the fate of the 439 children taken from the sect. It offers readers a rare glimpse into a tradition that\u0027s almost a century old, but has only now been exposed.
