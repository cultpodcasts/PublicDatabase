      "description": "What defines a cult? How do we make sense of the past, and what happens when the stories we inherit no longer serve us? In this episode, I sit down with Jonathan Hirsch\u2014journalist, audio documentarian, and VP of Podcasts at Sony Studios\u2014to explore his journey from growing up in a cult-like spiritual community to becoming one of the most compelling voices in audio storytelling. We discuss the psychology of cults, the resurgence of new-age movements, and his deeply personal memoir Mind Is Burning, which delves into family, faith, and the complexities of caring for an estranged parent. Join us for a thought-provoking conversation on identity, belief, and the stories that shape us.
