How to do trust anyone again? How do you know what kind of friends you do and don\u0027t want?

I found today\u0027s guest on Medium.com. I have read many of his articles and really loved them. In the last decade, I have had too many conversations with people who were damaged or confused by the purity culture movement in the church. Too many people have come forward with sexual abuse stories despite such conservative or extreme purity teachings in the church. Vytautas writes about purity in the church in such an intentional, careful, and Biblical way. So! I invited him to speak on the podcast.

How do you respond? What do you give space to or open yourself up to when you are being attacked? What happens in your head and your heart? Due to recent events, I had to take a step back, check my heart, check my stance, and spend a lot of time on my knees in prayer.
