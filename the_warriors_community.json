      "description": "I am honored to have my parents on the podcast! Neither one of them have ever told their side of the story publicly. But, they have decided to do so now in hopes to help another parent who feels helpless. We hope that hearing their story and hearing the three of us sit together and chat will bring hope, encouragement, wisdom, and peace to loved ones who know someone involved in a cult or religious abuse. I must say that I am beyond proud of my parents and deeply thankful for their continued love and support.

In the last decade, I have had too many conversations with people who were damaged or confused by the purity culture movement in the church.

Due to recent events, I had to take a step back, check my heart, check my stance, and spend a lot of time on my knees in prayer.

      "description": "Disclaimer: Not all of the views, beliefs, and core values expressed by guests on this podcast necessarily reflect the view, beliefs, and core values of Liza Lovett or the Warriors Community. I\u0027ve mentioned a podcast I discovered a few months ago on the podcast before. And now I have one of the podcast hosts joining me today! Amanda Turnbull is co-host of the Burning Butterflies Podcast where she and her co-host talk about their journey through a cult. They start at the very beginning and take you through it all! When I first listened to the Burning Butterflies podcast, I was amazed at how deeply I could relate to each episode. Today, Amanda shares part of her story about her experience in a cult and how she disentangled her beliefs once she left.
