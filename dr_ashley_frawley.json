      "description": "Andrew is a \u0022fallen BBC journalist\u0022, filmmaker and multi-linguist. He\u0027s the host of the award-winning podcast Heretics and the author of a new book, The Psychology of Secrets: My Adventures with Murderers, Cults and Influencers. We discuss the role that secrets play in keeping people controlled, or conversely, how revealing them can be freeing. On the flip side, we ask the question, can a culture of \u0022openness\u0022 be just as controlling?\n\nFor part 2 visit www.patreon.com/AshleyAFrawley\n\nListen wherever you get your podcasts, search: \u0022BasedAF\u0022\n\nTwitter/X, Insta: @AshleyAFrawley\n\n#heretics #mirandawilking #wilkingsisters #cults #secrets #sociology #psychology #truecrime",
