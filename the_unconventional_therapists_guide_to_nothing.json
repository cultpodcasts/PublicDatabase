      "title": "Guide to Warren Jeffs and the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS)",
      "description": "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints decided they would move on from the practice of polygamy in the early 20th century. Not all members agreed which caused a fracture where some practitioners wanted to follow more fundamentalists teaching. The FLDS was born and created fertile ground for Warren Jeffs to plant his evil seeds. Join Dave and Greg as they discuss polygamy, Warren Jeffs, and the FLDS as the dangerous cult that it is.
