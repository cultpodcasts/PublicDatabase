The new mom, a first-time parent who left the faith a decade ago, hosts a joyous gathering for her child, surrounded by family members who have also broken free from the religion\u0027s strict rules.\n\nThe celebration highlights the stark contrast between their current lives and their upbringing, where birthdays were forbidden and considered pagan. As the baby experiences important milestones, the camera captures the genuine excitement and love shared by the extended family.\n\nAn aunt, now a seasoned mother, reflects on her childhood within the Jehovah\u0027s Witness community. She discusses the restrictions she faced and how she now strives to nurture her children\u0027s curiosity and ambitions. Her story provides a meaningful comparison to the life she left behind.\n\nThe video also touches on the bittersweet reality of fractured family relationships. While the gathering is filled with love and laughter, there\u0027s a noticeable absence of relatives still active in the Jehovah\u0027s Witness faith. The family discusses the pain of being shunned by their Witness relatives, who refuse to participate due to fear of punishment from their religious community.\n\nThis intimate portrayal showcases the real social impact of the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses\u0027 ban on birthdays. It celebrates the freedom found in leaving the religion while acknowledging the ongoing struggles faced by those who break away. The video serves as a powerful testament to the resilience of these families and their determination to create new, joyful traditions despite the cost\n\nIn the month that I shot WITNESS UNDERGROUND, I also shot this with some of my oldest friends as part of the Seed\u0026Spark commitment I made to the the crowdfund backers then to expand XJW Coming Out series after shooing the feature documentary. \n\nThis birthday was just happening while I was visiting Madison and these friends so we made a special short video idea come together about a first birthday for a new mom and the implications of that on the kids and to discuss how the active members of the family treat them for doing this with a ten year recap on what life has been like after getting out of the culty faith.\n\nI was out of the religion at 19 but meeting these folks drew me back in. In part to honor that connection but also because we have an enduring friendship, I included the new mom, Jennifer Trucks, in the film WITNESS UNDERGROUND. She originally connected me to Nuclear Gopher folks, showing me the website. The uncle in the background, Mitchel Vandeheuvel, took me to Minneapolis to see a Nuclear Gopher show and meet some of the people in the film in 2001/2. He became a massive part of the film festival run in 2021, even hosting a major screening at the Wisconsin Film Festival when it was nearly impossible to do so during government lockdown (we were safe). It was a massive success. \n\nHe then helped to represent Debutante the shunning short filim by Kamila Dydyna, with me at Chicago Irish Film Festival. I\u0027m happy to say we are all still friends and all out of the religion. \n\nA lot of the Nuclear Gopher people came through Madison Wisconsin, a 5 hour drive from Minneapolis, in a music migration to Chicago, where the Amazing Fruit Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses were making music and on one fateful weekend during Weezer\u0027s Green album tour after a seven year hiatus, we all collided in Madison at the house that these two sisters and Mitchel were living in for late parties and the love of music.\n\n\n#jehovahswitnesses #cult #jworg #deconstructingfaith #igotout #recoveringfromreligion\n\n#jworguk #documentary #documentaryfilm #documentarymusic #jw #jworgusa #abuseofpower #christianmovies #atheist #atheism #humanist \n\n#CultSurvivor #ReligiousTrauma #EmotionalAbuse #FamilyHealing #BreakFree #MentalHealthAwareness #SpiritualAbuse #WomenEmpowerment #HealingJourney #SpeakYourTruth\n\n#ExJW #JehovahsWitnesses #Disfellowshipped #CultRecovery #ShunningSurvivor\n#ExJWCommunity #HighControlGroup #ExCultMember #ReligiousFreedom\n\n#UndergroundMusic #Rockumentary #IndieFilm #HealingThroughMusic #DIYMusicScene #RiotGrrrlRevolution #CreativeFreedom #MusicDocumentary #IndieArtists \n\n#StopShunning #ExposeCults #NoMoreSilence #SupportSurvivors #FaithDeconstruction #AdvocateForChange #TraumaInformed #ReligiousAccountability #EndReligiousAbuse #CultAwareness\n\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\nWatch Next: \u0022Cult members speak out  Rock the Watchtower  Cult Awareness Conference - WITNESS UNDERGROUND highlight\u0022 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2tYsA9nIXY\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-",

This section begins with Ryan Sutter providing an intimate tour of his library and music studio, reflecting on his life after exiting a cult. He introduces his self-made book, My Bible Volume 1, a compilation of texts he found significant or, as he describes using a religious term, \u0022holy.\u0022 This project was created during his deconstruction of Christian faith, a pivotal moment in his leaving Christianity testimony, when he realized he was an atheist.\n\nThe clip then shifts to a poignant story of emotional abuse demonstrated at a family funeral. Ryan shares the pain of being ostracized by over 1,000 active Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, who treated him as unworthy of attendance. The cult member interviews and commentary from active members highlight the emotional toll and healing religious trauma syndrome that followed this experience. This vivid portrayal of religious trauma syndrome underscores the challenges of life after a cult and the need for freedom from programming. Observers describe this situation as emblematic of healing from a religious sect and the lingering effects of healing from religious abuse.\n\nThe narrative takes a positive turn as Chad Rhiger recounts his journey of surviving after a cult. Chad\u0027s story is an uplifting example of artists escaping high-demand groups and artists escaping a religious sect. After leaving this apocalyptic faith, Chad joined HighTV, a band featuring two other former Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, Eric and Cindy Elvendahl, also featured in the film. Together, they channeled their shared experience of life after Watchtower into a creative explosion of music. Witness Underground is HighTV\u2019s indie rock record label documentary. Their presence shines with their first two albums\u2014unfiltered shoegaze masterpieces addressing their personal leaving a cult story and the liberation climax of this leaving religion documentary 2024.\n\nCindy Elvendahl\u2019s powerful vocals stand out as she explores themes personal liberation in this leaving Christian religion documentary, becoming free from indoctrination. HighTV\u0027s music reflects their collective journey to a life untethered by superstition. This former Christian religion punk rock documentary beautifully demonstrates using art for healing emotional trauma  as a tool for rebuilding after being in a cult.\n\nCreativity saves lives. The transformative power of music is captured in this life after Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses expos\u00E9. HighTV\u2019s uplifting melodies of former Christian rock \u2018n\u2019 roll provide a stark contrast to the challenges of surviving within a dystopia. They demonstrate that there is life after cult experiences.\n\n\uD83C\uDFA5 Call to Action:\nDon\u2019t miss this segment of the indie music record label rockumentary.

      "description": "Christian ministers punish teen woman - Elders sexual harassment\n\nThis harrowing chapter of Witness Underground reveals the destructive mechanisms of the Jehovah\u2019s Witness organization. Chad Rhiger, a member of Daytrip, HighTV, and Ghost Army, opens by describing the extreme social isolation used to erase the collective memory of former members. Whether individuals leave voluntarily or are disfellowshipped, the congregation enforces a system of complete emotional and social isolation. Elders\u2014the men in charge of congregation discipline\u2014use this form of punishment to maintain control, punishing anyone caught communicating with removed members. Such actions reinforce that all relationships within the group are conditional and devoid of genuine love. Many people refer to the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses as a hate group for mandating such extreme forms of isolation.\n\nRyan Sutter shares his struggles in this portion of the documentary. After his wife divorced him, she threatened to inform his father about Ryan\u2019s changing beliefs unless he disclosed them himself, forcing him into an emotionally excruciating position. Additionally, Ryan reflects on the downfall of the music scene that once thrived within the religion. After leaving, Ryan\u2019s music studio and website were handed to his brother, Reed, who rebranded them under the label Band Kids Unite. Over four years, the scene withered under this new management, further illustrating how control within the religion can extend to creative expression and community.\n\nEric Elvendahl provides an insider perspective on how this internal rule of law is enforced. Decisions by the elders often depend not on rule-breaking but on whether a person seems \u0022sorry\u0022 enough. However, gossip can tip the scales toward the harshest punishment: one full year of isolation while enduring public shaming in silence during 3-5 weekly church sessions. Victims are barred from speaking, sharing meals, or making eye contact with others, effectively destroying their social and familial ties.\n\nThe clip also touches on deeply personal accounts of emotional abuse and manipulation. Cindy Elvendahl exposes an unprecedented form of sexual harassment by Jehovah\u2019s Witness elders, recounting her experience as a teenager during a judicial meeting. This has since come out powerfully in narrative form in the short film Debutante. In this invasive and coercive process, three older men interrogated her about intimate sexual details, crossing her boundaries in ways that no Christian ministers should ever impose on a young woman. Cindy reflects on how this traumatic high-stakes experience at risk of losing her entire family and community shaped her as an adult, revealing the broader pattern of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses controlling women through fear and humiliation.\n\nThis clip unflinchingly exposes the intersection of elders\u2019 sexual harassment, emotional abuse in religion, and the soul-crushing punishments inflicted on members. From coercive meetings to the conditional love that tears families apart, this segment paints a stark picture of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 oppressive control.

Centered around Nuclear Gopher, a DIY indie music record label run by Jehovah\u0027s Witness members, this segment explores how a group of young creatives used music as a way of surviving within a dystopia of religious control.\n\nWhile faith and God were strictly off-limits as topics, this indie rock record label documentary highlights how these musicians thrived in a unique niche. The Christian indie alternative music produced under Nuclear Gopher broke boundaries, featuring Christian indie bands creating entirely secular work. One highlight is the edgy full-length music video for Lavone\u2019s \u201CShe Cooked Me Up and Ate Me for Dinner,\u201D a cannibalistic comedy that pushed the limits of what was acceptable in the community. Another spotlight is Daytrip, a shoegaze band that made waves in the Minneapolis music scene before the collapse of the community.\n\nThe film sheds light on the rise \u0026 fall of alternative rock within this unique faith-based environment, blending themes of leaving apocalyptic faith and using creativity to recover from religion with music. This Minnesota indie record label documentary is a must-watch for fans of indie rock Christian music, the Twin Cities music scene, and those interested in the power of music to help people heal while leaving post-apocalyptic faith.\n\nThis segment captures the rise and fall of indie rock within a tightly controlled religious community, offering a fascinating glimpse into the rise \u0026 fall of alternative rock through the lens of a Minnesota indie record label documentary. Nuclear Gopher represents the rise and fall of an indie label that provided an outlet for creative expression while surviving within a dystopia. As a Christian indie rock record label, it defied expectations by producing entirely secular music, marking a unique chapter in the rise and fall of Christian music and the rise and fall of Christian rock. The indie music record label Twin Cities scene flourished briefly, with bands like Daytrip and Lavone showcasing the raw talent of this group, but it ultimately couldn\u2019t withstand the pressures of the religious restrictions. This story is as much about the rise \u0026 fall of indie rock within a highly controlled environment as it is about surviving a dystopian society and finding a voice in a community that sought to silence individualism.\n\n03 - James \u0026 Daytrip - film music cannibalism satire music video - 03 highlights of the indie music record label inside religion",

Yatri, a recovered Jehovah\u0027s Witness missionary woman, offers a unique retreat program where she draws upon her personal experience and professional skills, creating a safe and transformative space for healing. As a Cosmic Therapist, Yatri provides a cosmic form of therapy designed specifically to aid those transitioning out of high-control groups, helping individuals recover from the rigid expectations and roles they may have experienced, such as the Jehovah\u0027s Witness women\u0027s role in the faith or other controlling backgrounds whether religious, romantic, business, friendships, political or otherwise... The control structures are everywhere and life has a way of flipping upside down on us and there aren\u0027t necessarily good structures, professionals to meet these needs and to guide the transition.\n\nThrough cosmic therapy sessions, Yatri brings a deep understanding of what it means to be a recovering Jehovah\u0027s Witness missionary minister woman. Her journey from a missionary role to a cosmic therapy practitioner uniquely positions her to guide others along a similar path. Her offerings, including Tarot reading, astrology, yoga, and shamanic Reiki, are all geared toward holistic healing and personal empowerment, allowing individuals to process and move beyond their past experiences as Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses and other controlling backgrounds.\n\nYatri is chosen family personally. It\u0027s not everyday I take the time to explore the world that Yatri swims in but I have a lot of respect for her and her work. We\u0027ve been meeting up every year in one country or another to catch up. This time we\u0027re doing it live so she can share what she does with you. Continue reading. I have so many questions. Pop into the chat if you do to.\r\n\r\nShe\u0027s a certified Spiritual Healer, Cosmotherapist, Artist and Astrologer. She has lived overseas the greater part of her adult life in South America, exploring  Asia, and Africa. She has developed a comprehensive worldview by identifying fundamental universal truths and collecting diverse tools for spiritual healing and orientation. Her mission is to guide herself and others to communion with the Collective Consciousness while offering grounding and embodiment practices to reach ones highest self. \r\n\r\nYatri completed her Evolutionary Astrology training and became a certified Cosmotherapist and Tarologist in Brazil, where she lived for seven years and learned fluent Portuguese. \u200B\r\n\r\nBorn into a religiously divided household, defining her spiritual stance in the world has never been optional and has defined her entire life course from her youth. She served as a missionary in Ecuador for 2 years in the Amazon, where she learned fluent Spanish. Her work with the Shuar tribe spawned a spiritual paradigm shift and awakened a thirst for understanding how spirituality is expressed in other cultures around the world.\r\n\r\nChoosing travel as a primary educational experience she began the search for fundamental truth; comparing definitions of sin and paths of communication and communion with the Self and the Divine. \r\n\r\nAfter 14 years of experiential and guided studies with different masters around the world, her Cosmotherapeutic practice has been born to be brought to the lives of those on similiar quests. Her practice today infuses Orientation with Astrology, Healing, Clearing and Chakra Balancing with Crystal therapy, Reiki, and Aromatherapy together with Shamanic and Vedic practices by inducing Journeying. These practices vary depending on the needs and goals of the individual. \r\n\r\nAs an Ordained Minister, she serves as a Teacher, Healer and Ceremony bearer for Birth, Life, Death and Union. \r\n\r\nWe made this using Streamyard - Get it here: https://streamyard.com/pal/d/6597707992137728",

Anusha Bradley will also be leading a panel at the upcoming Decult Cult Awareness Conference, where she will engage with former Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, including myself, to explore this harsh form of religious abuse that has affected countless lives globally.\n\n\nThis conversation covers Anusha\u2019s deep involvement in the New Zealand investigation into abuse in care within the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, a groundbreaking case the organization attempted to stop it with a lawsuit. Their resistance to scrutiny has only intensified the importance of this investigation, which could soon reveal critical findings about the abuse in care within this high-control religious group.\n\n\nWe explore the emotional toll that Jehovah\u2019s Witness shunning takes on individuals and families, and why this practice should be seen as a violation of human rights and religion. Anusha also talks about the importance of investigative journalism in holding powerful organizations accountable for their actions, and how the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses lawsuit has highlighted the need for further scrutiny.\u00A0\n\n\nThis interview is part of the Decult Cult Awareness Conference takeover, introducing viewers to the leading voices and experts in cult awareness and cult recovery.

Craig\u0027s powerful personal story, as told in his book Excommunicated: A Multigenerational Story of Leaving the Exclusive Brethren, sheds light on the traumatic consequences of ex-communication and the multigenerational impact of leaving a high-control religious group like the Exclusive Brethren New Zealand.\n\n\nAfter coming out as gay, Craig was excommunicated from the church, forced to say goodbye to his family forever, and thrust into a world he had never experienced. His book not only tells his coming out story, but also uncovers his family\u0027s deeply rooted history with the Exclusive Brethren, spanning over two centuries. We discuss what it was like leaving the Exclusive Brethren and how the emotional toll of ex-communication fueled his advocacy for human rights and religion, with a focus on religion, human rights, and social justice.\n\n\nCraig will be one of the featured speakers at the Decult Cult Awareness Conference, a vital cult conference addressing the hidden world of cults and coercive control. His talk will dive deep into the intersection of cult trauma recovery and human rights, sharing insights on what it means to be an ex-Exclusive Brethren member and a religious refugee, while also advocating for LGBT\u002B rights. His work exemplifies how journalists can play a key role in supporting human rights, and in this conversation, Craig shares his experiences with Journalists for Human Rights and the importance of covering stories about cult survivors.\n\n\nAs part of this Christchurch event, we also explore Craig\u0027s broader mission to raise awareness about cult dynamics, the importance of addressing cult awareness issues globally, and the fight for the rights of those impacted by religious and social oppression.\n\n\nDon\u2019t miss the chance to join this important discussion at the Decult Cult Awareness Conference!\nGet your live stream tickets for October 19th \u0026 20th here:\nhttps://events.humanitix.com/decult-cult-awareness-conference-tickets\n\n\nDon\u2019t miss this opportunity to hear Craig Hoyle\u2019s presentation and participate in meaningful conversations on cult trauma recovery, religious justice, and the global fight against coercive control.\n\n\n#DecultCultAwarenessConference #CraigHoyle #ExCommunicated #ExclusiveBrethren #ExExclusiveBrethren #CultAwareness #Excommunication #CultTraumaRecovery #CultConference #WitnessUnderground #MyComingOutStory2024 #LGBTWriter #HumanRightsAndReligion #ReligionHumanRightsAndSocialJustice #ChristchurchEvent #JournalistsForHumanRights\n\n\nSupport the show (https://www.patreon.com/WitnessUnderground) \n\n\nSubscribe to the newsletter for weekly episodes: \nhttps://bit.ly/WitnessUnderground\n\nWatch now:\nhttp://WitnessUnderground.com (https://witnessunderground.com/) \nhttps://tubitv.com/movies/100018684/witness-underground\nhttps://vimeo.com/ondemand/witnessunderground\n\nSupport:\nhttps://Patreon.com/WitnessUnderground (https://patreon.com/WitnessUnderground) \nhttps://YouTube.com/@WitnessUnderground (https://youtube.com/@WitnessUnderground) \n\nReach out directly: \nXJWdoc@gmail.com\n\n-Scott",

Music, fame, and success are typically forbidden in this group, which instructs its members to \u201Cbeware of independent thinking.\u201D\n\nThe artists at the heart of the music scene have their faith tested. They battle for mental health and push the boundaries of their religion\u2019s norms, where leaving means being banned from interacting with your entire family and social circle for life.\n\nAlthough severely restricted, they create the record label Nuclear Gopher and produced over 30 albums of earnest and personal music that spans: singer/songwriter, riot grrrl, psychedelic rock, pop, EDM, shoegaze, and post-rock. Carefully curated performances punctuate their stories of friendship, deep loss, and personal growth.\n\nLong Pitch:\nIn suburban Minneapolis, upstanding Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are arriving home after hours of doorbell ringing and front doors slamming.\n\nBut not Cindy, or the elder staring down this teenager.\nOr the man she lost her virginity to hours ago in a hotel.\n\n\u201CDid you start it? Did you touch him?\u201D, the elder asks.\n\n\u201CDid you have an orgasm?\u201D\n\nShe played a show that week. A coffee shop Witnesses flocked to.\n\nShe plucked strings to her pop-punk anthem.\nShe belted out the words her spirit had tried to hide.\nHer \u0022Prayer To No One\u0022 ricocheted off the walls to a riveted crowd.\n\nThey wanted an encore.\nShe knew a private punishment wasn\u2019t going to be enough.\nShe went back for more.\n\nWitness Underground unveils an unexplored music community surviving within a dystopia. Humanizing the struggle, courage, and artistry of former members.\n\nFrom home-brew music videos to grand pop-up festivals over 17 years and 30 albums. Art becomes more than self-expression; it is awakening, healing, and freedom from their trauma. \u0022Frequently searing and undeniably confrontational.\u201D [Tone Madison Music Magazine]\n\nLong Synopsis:\nA chilling, yet empowering social impact documentary, Witness Underground highlights the music and defection of doomsday cult members and the consequences of self-expression. A \u201Cunique look, with unwavering access, inside the complexities of faith, and the bond forged between artists.\u201D [Amir George, Film and Art Programmer, True/False Film Festival.] \n\nNuclear Gopher, an underground indie record label, arose within their dystopia as a safe space for a few hundred born-in artists to express themselves. Witness the history of their most prolific underground bands as they navigated in the shadows of a high-control society. \n\nFrom homebrew music videos to pop-up music festivals this community created earnest, multi-genre, secular music, as a means of waking up, and processing trauma. \u0022Frequently searing and undeniably confrontational\u0022 [Tone Madison] As outcasts they expose the losses of community and family. Their music is more than just an outlet for self-expression but a powerful tool to heal.",

Music, fame, and success are typically forbidden in this group, which instructs its members to \u201Cbeware of independent thinking.\u201D\n\nThe artists at the heart of the music scene have their faith tested. They battle for mental health and push the boundaries of their religion\u2019s norms, where leaving means being banned from interacting with your entire family and social circle for life.\n\nAlthough severely restricted, they create the record label Nuclear Gopher and produced over 30 albums of earnest and personal music that spans: singer/songwriter, riot grrrl, psychedelic rock, pop, EDM, shoegaze, and post-rock. Carefully curated performances punctuate their stories of friendship, deep loss, and personal growth.\n\nLong Pitch:\nIn suburban Minneapolis, upstanding Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are arriving home after hours of doorbell ringing and front doors slamming.\n\nBut not Cindy, or the elder staring down this teenager.\nOr the man she lost her virginity to hours ago in a hotel.\n\n\u201CDid you start it? Did you touch him?\u201D, the elder asks.\n\n\u201CDid you have an orgasm?\u201D\n\nShe played a show that week. A coffee shop Witnesses flocked to.\n\nShe plucked strings to her pop-punk anthem.\nShe belted out the words her spirit had tried to hide.\nHer \u0022Prayer To No One\u0022 ricocheted off the walls to a riveted crowd.\n\nThey wanted an encore.\nShe knew a private punishment wasn\u2019t going to be enough.\nShe went back for more.\n\nWitness Underground unveils an unexplored music community surviving within a dystopia. Humanizing the struggle, courage, and artistry of former members.\n\nFrom home-brew music videos to grand pop-up festivals over 17 years and 30 albums. Art becomes more than self-expression; it is awakening, healing, and freedom from their trauma. \u0022Frequently searing and undeniably confrontational.\u201D [Tone Madison Music Magazine]\n\nLong Synopsis:\nA chilling, yet empowering social impact documentary, Witness Underground highlights the music and defection of doomsday cult members and the consequences of self-expression. A \u201Cunique look, with unwavering access, inside the complexities of faith, and the bond forged between artists.\u201D [Amir George, Film and Art Programmer, True/False Film Festival.] \n\nNuclear Gopher, an underground indie record label, arose within their dystopia as a safe space for a few hundred born-in artists to express themselves. Witness the history of their most prolific underground bands as they navigated in the shadows of a high-control society. \n\nFrom homebrew music videos to pop-up music festivals these groups created earnest, multi-genre, secular music, as a means of waking up, and processing trauma. \u0022Frequently searing and undeniably confrontational\u0022 [Tone Madison] As outcasts they expose the losses of community and family. Their music is more than just an outlet for self-expression but rather as a powerful tool to heal.",

Check out the Live Campaign!\r\n\r\nhttps://www.boosted.org.nz/projects/decult-documentary\r\n\r\nAustralasia will host its first ever cult awareness conference in October. Tickets, newsletter and info: https://www.decult.net\r\n\r\nExperts and survivors will meet in Christchurch to highlight how cults work, and the harm they cause.\r\n\r\nThe conference is called Decult, and is being organised by journalist and author of Cult Trip: Inside the World of Coercion and Control, Anke Richter, an Author, reporter and cult researcher.\r\n\r\nThe Aim:\r\nDecult 2024 is a pioneering conference that addresses the pervasive harm inflicted by high-control groups in New Zealand. By giving cult survivors a voice and bringing experts from various fields together, they\u2019re creating a unique opportunity for mental health professionals, government departments, law enforcement and first responders to offer better support and prevent cultic harm in the future. The aim is to develop lasting networks for professionals and to present ongoing events. More cult awareness will improve the wellbeing of vulnerable individuals.\r\n\r\nThe Conference:\r\nSpend a weekend with authors and educators, academics and counsellors, survivors and their advocates as they share their expertise and personal stories. Decult is for anyone interested in spirituality, religion or personal growth who wants to engage in respectful discussion to broaden their knowledge \u2013 especially health professionals and frontline services helping cult victims: How does recruitment work, what are the signs of coercive control, how can people get out, and how can they recover?\r\n\r\nRegardless of their background, faith or belief system, attendees will leave with a deeper understanding of harmful dynamics in cult-like groups and how to support cult leavers better. This thought-provoking event will be a forum for those who left their communities to connect with others and feel heard and seen. Let\u2019s show them that we care.\r\n\r\nThe Documentary:\r\nAward-winning film makers Robyn Jordaan and Caleb MacDonald have an ambitious plan to create a documentary about the Decult 2024 Conference in October. As this is the first cult awareness conference of its kind in Australasia, they\u2019re creating a resource that can long outlive the conference. \r\n\r\nTheir film will include interviews with our speakers \u2013 authors, educators, counsellors, academics and survivors \u2013 sharing their expertise and personal stories. It is our hope that audiences will gain a deeper understanding of harmful dynamics in cult-like groups, how to prevent them, and how to support cult leavers better. \r\n\r\nThis amount will allow them to produce a 20-30 minute documentary which showcases the conference and also features interviews with speakers and survivors.\r\n\r\nThe funding goal allows us to cover the basic costs of creating the documentary and recaps (transport, filming, production tasks, marketing fees). The stretch goal will provide additional creative support for the conference and the Decult Charitable Trust.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t have the ability to contribute? You could consider spreading the word.

      "description": "Emmanuel Goldstein grew up in a Gnostic faith in Germany and was incorrectly taught that all Christians essentially worship, believe, and act similar to how the extremist cult that my family joined, actually do. Gnostic teachings about Yahweh, Jesus, Satan vs Jehovah Witness. Which god is YHWH in the biblical Jewish pantheon? One of the core teachings of Gnostics is that the god that christians actually worship, is... well you know what, I don\u0027t know. That\u0027s why Emmanuel Goldstein [1984 Orwell fame] is coming on to reveal what he was raised to believe, from a modern gnostic perspective. \r\n\r\nHe\u0027s a facinating guy!\nFollow his substack here:\nhttps://emmanuelgoldstein1984.substack.com\n\nCheck out his channel before the live stream.

Hailing from a Gnostic upbringing in Germany, Goldstein brings a unique perspective shaped by his lived experience with gnostic teachings. Join us as we delve into his experiences and insights, challenging conventional beliefs about Christianity and the worship of YHWH in the biblical Jewish pantheon.\n\nIntriguingly, Goldstein was led to believe that all mainstream Christians adhere to extremist ideologies akin to the cult I once belonged to\u2014a misconception that we\u0027ll explore. Central to Gnostic teachings is the notion that the deity worshipped by Christians may not be as straightforward as it seems. Goldstein tantalizingly hints at revelations regarding this concept that intriugued me. He promises to shed light on the true nature of the god Christians worship and revelations about what he actually discovered and why he reached out to me.\n\nIn anticipation of this discussion, we invite you to explore Emmanuel Goldstein\u0027s channel for a glimpse into his thought-provoking perspectives. Prepare to expand your understanding of Gnosticism and its implications for modern religious discourse. Don\u0027t miss out on this opportunity to challenge preconceptions and delve into the mysteries of faith.\n\nBe sure to tune in to the live stream and join the conversation in the chat as we unravel the complexities of Gnostic beliefs and how what I and many actually lived in the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses was what he was warned about.",

He flew up from Asheville North Carolina as our producer in Minneapolis and was the guiding light for multiple editing revisions.He brought a fresh perspective to the project that became essential in telling this deep nuanced story. This episode was recorded at the Auxbus podcast studio in Asheville, a start-up where he pioneered the audio software we recorded this on. He interviews me and my personal back story for the first time.\u00A0 (Auxbus was later bought by Libsyn and his software is their trademark audio editing software for their podcast\u00A0 distribution company). This was recorded on the heals of our production together, and after story-lock in our documentary post-production phase. He had a huge hand in the production influencing the story, and pulling out many valuable moments across our interviews. He also ran sound, wrote interview questions, and asked the interview questions, co-directing the storytelling.\u00A0 He also ran second camera for interviews, live performance music videos, and also some of the side stories that made it into the film, among many additional roles that we shared.\u00A0He was essential in the creation of this film.\u00A0 Enjoy this episode as he digs into my back story and the creation of this film, the XJW Coming Out series, and this podcast.Thanks Ryan!Watch now:http://WitnessUnderground.comWatch \u0026 Support:https://vimeo.com/ondemand/witnessundergroundhttps://Patreon.com/WitnessUndergroundhttps://YouTube.com/@WitnessUndergroundStore:https://witness-underground-cult-documentary-release.pledgebox.com/preorderJump into our Discordhttps://discord.gg/WUp9c95rsXReach out directly: XJWdoc@gmail.com-Scott",

We ended up shooting these additional short interviews in the backyard during the event for the XJW Coming Out series as a bonus episode.\n\nThree short interviews capture the diverse experiences of individuals who found the courage to question their upbringing in this \u0022Apocalyptic cult\u0022 and, in doing so, discovered the strength to forge their own paths.\n\nListen to three former Witnesses, Jesse America, Erica Rae, and James Zimmerman who got out. They all describe what life was like inside, pressures they experienced, why they left, and their new world views. \n\nThey dive into how they feel about this group looking back into their strange past.\n\nTopics discussed:\nCognitive dissonance, conflict caused by religion, inner feelings as a witness, cultural norms within the cult, mis-education, becoming open-minded, disconnection with organized religion, different way to believe in god, atheism, enjoying life now rather than waiting on a higher power, reconnecting with grandparents and other family that were disconnected from because of this religions intolerance of non-members. Being honest about reality, achieving contentment in life through community, life passions, bond through powerful friendships. Family strength, success through education, first in family history to get a degree, feeling of freedom and access to pursue passions, showing love without judgement towards others.\n\nUntethered from authoritarian control what did you do with your freedom?\n\nAre you happier now?\n\nWhat do you do now with your life?\n\nWhat advice can you give to active members of the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses?\n\n\u0022I\u0027m so much happier not being in this religion anymore.
