      "description": "Ross and Carrie cough up too much money to attend a one-night dinner inspired by the famous Source Family, a hippie-spiritual commune headed by Jim Baker, who owned one of the first health food restaurants in the country, on LA\u0027s Sunset Strip. The group functionally dissolved after the death of Baker (AKA Father Yod) in 1975, but a 2012 documentary brought its memory back to life. Now, local vegan restaurant Caf\u00E9 Gratitude, which claims inspiration from The Source Family, hosts its own event, honoring Father Yod and his followers... some of whom attend. Plus, we learn all about Caf\u00E9 Gratitude\u0027s unofficial connection to the \u0022personal growth\u0022 corporation Landmark International, and find out who Father Yod wouldn\u0027t vote for in 2020.
