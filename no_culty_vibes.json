Her Album \u0022A Letting Go\u0022 is available now everywhere you can stream music. A Letting Go chronicles the too-familiar journey of missing someone who hurt you and reckoning with the hurt, accepting the feelings you felt and maybe still feel for them, knowing the conversation you\u2019re having about it will always be one sided. There will be no closure. They will never reply. This album is singer-songwriter Haley Osier having that one sided conversation in front of us, letting us in as she\u2019s letting go and hoping she\u2019s not as alone as she feels doing it.
