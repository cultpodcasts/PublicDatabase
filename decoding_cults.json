Thus, I ended up right at the beginning which is the start of the Millerite movement and the creation of the Seventh-day Adventist church. In this episode, I will take you back to the origin story of this branch of Christianity. Trust me, there is some very interesting and head shaking information there.

In this vision, his deceased daughter Evangelista had appeared to him and foretold that he would be visited by \u201Capparitions from heaven\u201D. This came to fruition in 1988 when he said that he had been visited by St Joseph, Mary and Jesus. He claimed that they had tasked him to use his land near the city of Kanungu, as a gathering place for believers.
