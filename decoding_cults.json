      "description": "In 1960 Paul Kashaku, a farmer with a small farmstead in the hill country, claimed that he had a vision. In this vision, his deceased daughter Evangelista had appeared to him and foretold that he would be visited by \u201Capparitions from heaven\u201D. This came to fruition in 1988 when he said that he had been visited by St Joseph, Mary and Jesus. He claimed that they had tasked him to use his land near the city of Kanungu, as a gathering place for believers. Kanungu is a town in the western region of Uganda about 404km from the capital Kampala. This town has now become infamous, and you will hear why later in the story.
