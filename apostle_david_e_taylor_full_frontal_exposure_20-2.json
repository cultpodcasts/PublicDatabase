      "description": "Welcome to Full Frontal Investigation, a bold and unapologetic YouTube channel dedicated to exposing the dark underbelly of religious cults, corrupt churches, YouTube \u201Cprophets,\u201D and the vast web of financial and criminal misconduct that hides behind the veil of faith in America.\n\nThis channel was created out of a deep need for truth, accountability, and justice\u2014especially in spaces that often operate beyond the reach of scrutiny.\n\nWhile religion should be a source of comfort, guidance, and community, it has also been exploited by con artists, narcissists, and criminal enterprises that use scripture as a smokescreen and manipulate faith for power and profit.\n\nOur mission is clear: Shine an unflinching light on religious corruption, financial exploitation, and the cults that prey on the vulnerable.\n\n1. Religious Cults in America from secretive compounds to live-streamed sermons, we dissect the mechanics of control, manipulation, and abuse employed by modern-day cult leaders. Whether it\u2019s a fringe sect in the desert or a mega-church with millions of followers, we explore how these organizations isolate followers, suppress dissent, and enforce obedience\u2014sometimes with devastating consequences.\n\n2. Financial Fraud and Criminal Activity: Behind many charismatic leaders lies a paper trail of deceit. We dig deep into IRS filings, court records, real estate transactions, and whistleblower testimonies to uncover the financial schemes that funnel millions into the pockets of \u201Cspiritual leaders.\u201D From Ponzi schemes disguised as \u201Cblessings\u201D to money laundering masked as ministry work, we follow the money\u2014and it often leads to disturbing revelations.\n\n3. Mortgage and Real Estate Scams: Religious organizations frequently engage in shady real estate ventures\u2014buying properties under shell companies, flipping churches for profit, or coercing followers to sign over deeds to their homes in exchange for promises of divine favor. Full Frontal Investigation highlights the systemic abuse of nonprofit status and investigates how some churches operate like real estate conglomerates rather than places of worship.\n\n4. YouTube Prophets and Digital Cult Leaders: A new breed of self-proclaimed \u201Cprophets\u201D is emerging online\u2014gathering massive audiences, donations, and power through social media. With prophetic livestreams, donation links, and apocalyptic warnings, these digital influencers claim to speak for God while raking in tens of thousands of dollars. We analyze their tactics, fact-check their prophecies, and investigate where the money really goes.\n\n5. Abuse of Nonprofit Religious Status: Churches enjoy unique legal protections and tax exemptions in the United States. This loophole has created fertile ground for financial exploitation. We spotlight how certain ministries, and religious figures abuse this status to hide assets, avoid taxes, and escape accountability.\n\nReligion is one of the most powerful forces in human history. At its best, it inspires compassion, community, and purpose. At its worst, it becomes a tool of psychological coercion, financial exploitation, and criminal behavior\u2014all under the protection of spiritual authority.\n\nIn the United States, religious organizations are rarely held accountable. Their financials are largely exempt from transparency laws. Their leaders are elevated to untouchable status.

      "description": "Welcome to Full Frontal Investigation, a bold and unapologetic YouTube channel dedicated to exposing the dark underbelly of religious cults, corrupt churches, YouTube \u201Cprophets,\u201D and the vast web of financial and criminal misconduct that hides behind the veil of faith in America.\n\nThis channel was created out of a deep need for truth, accountability, and justice\u2014especially in spaces that often operate beyond the reach of scrutiny.\n\nWhile religion should be a source of comfort, guidance, and community, it has also been exploited by con artists, narcissists, and criminal enterprises that use scripture as a smokescreen and manipulate faith for power and profit.\n\nOur mission is clear: Shine an unflinching light on religious corruption, financial exploitation, and the cults that prey on the vulnerable.\n\n1. Religious Cults in America from secretive compounds to live-streamed sermons, we dissect the mechanics of control, manipulation, and abuse employed by modern-day cult leaders. Whether it\u2019s a fringe sect in the desert or a mega-church with millions of followers, we explore how these organizations isolate followers, suppress dissent, and enforce obedience\u2014sometimes with devastating consequences.\n\n2. Financial Fraud and Criminal Activity: Behind many charismatic leaders lies a paper trail of deceit. We dig deep into IRS filings, court records, real estate transactions, and whistleblower testimonies to uncover the financial schemes that funnel millions into the pockets of \u201Cspiritual leaders.\u201D From Ponzi schemes disguised as \u201Cblessings\u201D to money laundering masked as ministry work, we follow the money\u2014and it often leads to disturbing revelations.\n\n3. Mortgage and Real Estate Scams: Religious organizations frequently engage in shady real estate ventures\u2014buying properties under shell companies, flipping churches for profit, or coercing followers to sign over deeds to their homes in exchange for promises of divine favor. Full Frontal Investigation highlights the systemic abuse of nonprofit status and investigates how some churches operate like real estate conglomerates rather than places of worship.\n\n4. YouTube Prophets and Digital Cult Leaders: A new breed of self-proclaimed \u201Cprophets\u201D is emerging online\u2014gathering massive audiences, donations, and power through social media. With prophetic livestreams, donation links, and apocalyptic warnings, these digital influencers claim to speak for God while raking in tens of thousands of dollars. We analyze their tactics, fact-check their prophecies, and investigate where the money really goes.\n\n5. Abuse of Nonprofit Religious Status: Churches enjoy unique legal protections and tax exemptions in the United States. This loophole has created fertile ground for financial exploitation. We spotlight how certain ministries, and religious figures abuse this status to hide assets, avoid taxes, and escape accountability.\n\nReligion is one of the most powerful forces in human history. At its best, it inspires compassion, community, and purpose. At its worst, it becomes a tool of psychological coercion, financial exploitation, and criminal behavior\u2014all under the protection of spiritual authority.\n\nIn the United States, religious organizations are rarely held accountable. Their financials are largely exempt from transparency laws. Their leaders are elevated to untouchable status.

      "description": "Welcome to Full Frontal Investigation, a bold and unapologetic YouTube channel dedicated to exposing the dark underbelly of religious cults, corrupt churches, YouTube \u201Cprophets,\u201D and the vast web of financial and criminal misconduct that hides behind the veil of faith in America.\n\nThis channel was created out of a deep need for truth, accountability, and justice\u2014especially in spaces that often operate beyond the reach of scrutiny.\n\nWhile religion should be a source of comfort, guidance, and community, it has also been exploited by con artists, narcissists, and criminal enterprises that use scripture as a smokescreen and manipulate faith for power and profit.\nOur mission is clear: shine an unflinching light on religious corruption, financial exploitation, and the cults that prey on the vulnerable.\n\n1. Religious Cults in America from secretive compounds to live-streamed sermons, we dissect the mechanics of control, manipulation, and abuse employed by modern-day cult leaders. Whether it\u2019s a fringe sect in the desert or a mega-church with millions of followers, we explore how these organizations isolate followers, suppress dissent, and enforce obedience\u2014sometimes with devastating consequences.\n\n2. Financial Fraud and Criminal ActivityBehind many charismatic leaders lies a paper trail of deceit. We dig deep into IRS filings, court records, real estate transactions, and whistleblower testimonies to uncover the financial schemes that funnel millions into the pockets of \u201Cspiritual leaders.\u201D From Ponzi schemes disguised as \u201Cblessings\u201D to money laundering masked as ministry work, we follow the money\u2014and it often leads to disturbing revelations.\n\n3. Mortgage and Real Estate ScamsReligious organizations frequently engage in shady real estate ventures\u2014buying properties under shell companies, flipping churches for profit, or coercing followers to sign over deeds to their homes in exchange for promises of divine favor. Full Frontal Investigation highlights the systemic abuse of nonprofit status and investigates how some churches operate like real estate conglomerates rather than places of worship.\n\n4. YouTube Prophets and Digital Cult LeadersA new breed of self-proclaimed \u201Cprophets\u201D is emerging online\u2014gathering massive audiences, donations, and power through social media. With prophetic livestreams, donation links, and apocalyptic warnings, these digital influencers claim to speak for God while raking in tens of thousands of dollars. We analyze their tactics, fact-check their prophecies, and investigate where the money really goes.\n\n5. Abuse of Nonprofit Religious StatusChurches enjoy unique legal protections and tax exemptions in the United States. This loophole has created fertile ground for financial exploitation. We spotlight how certain ministries and religious figures abuse this status to hide assets, avoid taxes, and escape accountability.\n\nReligion is one of the most powerful forces in human history. At its best, it inspires compassion, community, and purpose. At its worst, it becomes a tool of psychological coercion, financial exploitation, and criminal behavior\u2014all under the protection of spiritual authority.\n\nIn the United States, religious organizations are rarely held accountable. Their financials are largely exempt from transparency laws. Their leaders are elevated to untouchable status.

      "description": "@ApostleKathrynKrick @FiveFoldChurch @fbi @GeorDavieTV @davidetaylor @DavidETaylorMiraclesinAmerica @kingdomofgodglobalchurch-k113\n\nWelcome to Full Frontal Investigation, a bold and unapologetic YouTube channel dedicated to exposing the dark underbelly of religious cults, corrupt churches, YouTube \u201Cprophets,\u201D and the vast web of financial and criminal misconduct that hides behind the veil of faith in America.\n\nThis channel was created out of a deep need for truth, accountability, and justice\u2014especially in spaces that often operate beyond the reach of scrutiny.\n\nWhile religion should be a source of comfort, guidance, and community, it has also been exploited by con artists, narcissists, and criminal enterprises that use scripture as a smokescreen and manipulate faith for power and profit.\nOur mission is clear: shine an unflinching light on religious corruption, financial exploitation, and the cults that prey on the vulnerable.\n\n1. Religious Cults in America from secretive compounds to live-streamed sermons, we dissect the mechanics of control, manipulation, and abuse employed by modern-day cult leaders. Whether it\u2019s a fringe sect in the desert or a mega-church with millions of followers, we explore how these organizations isolate followers, suppress dissent, and enforce obedience\u2014sometimes with devastating consequences.\n\n2.

We analyze their tactics, fact-check their prophecies, and investigate where the money really goes.\n\n5. Abuse of Nonprofit Religious StatusChurches enjoy unique legal protections and tax exemptions in the United States. This loophole has created fertile ground for financial exploitation. We spotlight how certain ministries and religious figures abuse this status to hide assets, avoid taxes, and escape accountability.\n\nReligion is one of the most powerful forces in human history. At its best, it inspires compassion, community, and purpose. At its worst, it becomes a tool of psychological coercion, financial exploitation, and criminal behavior\u2014all under the protection of spiritual authority.\n\nIn the United States, religious organizations are rarely held accountable.

Religious Cults in America from secretive compounds to live-streamed sermons, we dissect the mechanics of control, manipulation, and abuse employed by modern-day cult leaders.

Financial Fraud and Criminal ActivityBehind many charismatic leaders lies a paper trail of deceit. We dig deep into IRS filings, court records, real estate transactions, and whistleblower testimonies to uncover the financial schemes that funnel millions into the pockets of \u201Cspiritual leaders.\u201D From Ponzi schemes disguised as \u201Cblessings\u201D to money laundering masked as ministry work, we follow the money\u2014and it often leads to disturbing revelations.\n\n3.

Religious Cults in America from secretive compounds to live-streamed sermons, we dissect the mechanics of control, manipulation, and abuse employed by modern-day cult leaders.

      "description": "Welcome to Full Frontal Investigation, a bold and unapologetic YouTube channel dedicated to exposing the dark underbelly of religious cults, corrupt churches, YouTube \u201Cprophets,\u201D and the vast web of financial and criminal misconduct that hides behind the veil of faith in America.\nThis channel was created out of a deep need for truth, accountability, and justice\u2014especially in spaces that often operate beyond the reach of scrutiny. While religion should be a source of comfort, guidance, and community, it has also been exploited by con artists, narcissists, and criminal enterprises that use scripture as a smokescreen and manipulate faith for power and profit.\nOur mission is clear: shine an unflinching light on religious corruption, financial exploitation, and the cults that prey on the vulnerable.\n\nReligious Cults in America\nFrom secretive compounds to live-streamed sermons, we dissect the mechanics of control, manipulation, and abuse employed by modern-day cult leaders. Whether it\u2019s a fringe sect in the desert or a mega-church with millions of followers, we explore how these organizations isolate followers, suppress dissent, and enforce obedience\u2014sometimes with devastating consequences.\n\nFinancial Fraud and Criminal Activity\nBehind many charismatic leaders lies a paper trail of deceit. We dig deep into IRS filings, court records, real estate transactions, and whistleblower testimonies to uncover the financial schemes that funnel millions into the pockets of \u201Cspiritual leaders.\u201D From Ponzi schemes disguised as \u201Cblessings\u201D to money laundering masked as ministry work, we follow the money\u2014and it often leads to disturbing revelations.\n \nMortgage and Real Estate Scams\nReligious organizations frequently engage in shady real estate ventures\u2014buying properties under shell companies, flipping churches for profit, or coercing followers to sign over deeds to their homes in exchange for promises of divine favor. Full Frontal Investigation highlights the systemic abuse of nonprofit status and investigates how some churches operate like real estate conglomerates rather than places of worship.\n\nYouTube Prophets and Digital Cult Leaders\nA new breed of self-proclaimed \u201Cprophets\u201D is emerging online\u2014gathering massive audiences, donations, and power through social media. With prophetic livestreams, donation links, and apocalyptic warnings, these digital influencers claim to speak for God while raking in tens of thousands of dollars. We analyze their tactics, fact-check their prophecies, and investigate where the money really goes.\n\nAbuse of Nonprofit Religious Status\nChurches enjoy unique legal protections and tax exemptions in the United States. This loophole has created fertile ground for financial exploitation. We spotlight how certain ministries and religious figures abuse this status to hide assets, avoid taxes, and escape accountability.\n\n\u2022 Investigative Reports\nFast-paced and detailed investigations that break down complex scams and cult dynamics. These reports include visual evidence, public records, and a thorough breakdown of who\u2019s involved, what laws may have been broken, and who\u2019s profiting.\n\u2022 Whistleblower Testimonies\nWe give a platform to former members, insiders, and survivors who are ready to speak out. Their stories are vital to understanding the psychological, spiritual, and financial manipulation used by cults and corrupt churches.\n\u2022 Prophecy Fact-Checks\nEvery week, we review the wildest predictions made by YouTube prophets and televangelists\u2014checking them against real-world outcomes and highlighting the patterns of manipulation behind these so-called revelations.\n\u2022 Legal Deep Dives\nWith expert insight and accessible analysis, we walk viewers through the legal mechanisms these organizations exploit\u2014and how law enforcement, IRS loopholes, and lack of oversight allow this behavior to persist.\n\nReligion is one of the most powerful forces in human history. At its best, it inspires compassion, community, and purpose. At its worst, it becomes a tool of psychological coercion, financial exploitation, and criminal behavior\u2014all under the protection of spiritual authority.\nIn the United States, religious organizations are rarely held accountable. Their financials are largely exempt from transparency laws. Their leaders are elevated to untouchable status. And their followers are often too afraid\u2014or too conditioned\u2014to speak out.\nThat\u2019s where Full Frontal Investigation comes in.\nWe\u2019re not anti-religion. We\u2019re anti-corruption.\nThis channel is a voice for the voiceless. A digital watchdog that refuses to look away. A platform where truth outweighs doctrine, and justice speaks louder than words.\n\nContact \u0026 Confidential Tips:We take anonymity seriously. If you have credible information, documents, or stories to share, please contact us securely. We vet all sources, protect whistleblower identities, and strive to maintain the highest journalistic standards.\n\nFull Frontal InvestigationWhere Truth Has No Sanctuary",

Taylor, Michelle Brannon, JMMI, KOGGC, \u0026 Marvels in America World Healing cult. In 2014 \u0026 2015 a set of depositions were taken that were eventually released in 2017 by Rick Frazier. These depositions show the true depths of David E. Taylor \u0026 Michelle Brannons\u0027 scams, lies, and money laundering operation they are running through their cult. David is using religion to manipulate people emotionally, sexually, spiritually \u0026 financially. Over the last 33 years David E. Taylor has used his cunning and guile to double cross brainwashed followers into giving him hundreds of millions of dollars so he can live his lavish lifestyle. However, there is a deeper and darker dynamic to this very dangerous religous cult that needs to be examined under a microscope. One of the reasons being, David still makes claims to this day that he has seen Jesus well over a 1,000 times and speaks to god on a daily basis. David also claims he has healed cancer, raised the dead, healed the sick, grown back severed limbs, and his most outrageous claim that he cleared an entire hospitals of sick people. These claims of course are all baseless that have absolutely no scientific proof or proof from doctors to validate these occurrences. Youtube is allowing David operate his money laundering scam by letting him purchase his views and subscribers on the platform, thus he continues to manipulate people into donating their last dollar to him so that he can fund a lavish lifestyle. If you would like to help stop this cult please help by filing fraud reports to the #IRS linked in the channel description. It is anonymous and no one will know who has filed a report including the channel owner. All the information has been filled in for you on the report to make it as quick and easy as possible, as I know time is precious to everyone.

Taylor, Michelle Brannon, JMMI, KOGGC, \u0026 Marvels in America World Healing cult. In 2014 \u0026 2015 a set of depositions were taken that were eventually released in 2017 by Rick Frazier. These depositions show the true depths of David E. Taylor \u0026 Michelle Brannon\u0027s\u0027 scams, lies, and money laundering operation they are running through their cult. David is using religion to manipulate people emotionally, sexually, spiritually \u0026 financially. Over the last 33 years David E. Taylor has used his cunning and guile to double cross brainwashed followers into giving him hundreds of millions of dollars so he can live his lavish lifestyle. However, there is a deeper and darker dynamic to this very dangerous religious cult that needs to be examined under a microscope. One of the reasons being, David still makes claims to this day that he has seen Jesus well over 1,000 times and speaks to God on a daily basis. David also claims he has healed cancer, raised the dead, healed the sick, grown back severed limbs, and his most outrageous claim that he cleared an entire hospital of sick people. These claims of course are all baseless that have absolutely no scientific proof or proof from doctors to validate these occurrences. YouTube is allowing David to operate his money laundering scam by letting him purchase his views and subscribers on the platform, thus he continues to manipulate people into donating their last dollar to him so that he can fund a lavish lifestyle. If you would like to help stop this cult, please help by filing fraud reports to the #IRS linked in the channel description. It is anonymous and no one will know who has filed a report including the channel owner. All the information has been filled in for you on the report to make it as quick and easy as possible, as I know time is precious to everyone. Please help us stop these destructive cults and their leaders from destroying anymore lives by having their tax-exempt status removed. Once David E.

These depositions show the true depths of David E. Taylor \u0026 Michelle Brannons\u0027 scams, lies, and money laundering operation they are running through their cult. David is using religion to manipulate people emotionally, sexually, spiritually \u0026 financially. Over the last 33 years David E. Taylor has used his cunning and guile to double cross brainwashed followers into giving him hundreds of millions of dollars so he can live his lavish lifestyle. However, there is a deeper and darker dynamic to this very dangerous religous cult that needs to be examined under a microscope. One of the reasons being, David still makes claims to this day that he has seen Jesus well over a 1,000 times and speaks to god on a daily basis. David also claims he has healed cancer, raised the dead, healed the sick, grown back severed limbs, and his most outrageous claim that he cleared an entire hospitals of sick people. These claims of course are all baseless that have absolutely no scientific proof or proof from doctors to validate these occurrences. Youtube is allowing David operate his money laundering scam by letting him purchase his views and subscribers on the platform, thus he continues to manipulate people into donating their last dollar to him so that he can fund a lavish lifestyle.

Taylor, Michelle Brannon, JMMI, KOGGC, \u0026 Marvels in America World Healing cult. In 2014 \u0026 2015 a set of depositions were taken that were eventually released in 2017 by Rick Frazier. These depositions show the true depths of David E. Taylor \u0026 Michelle Brannons\u0027 scams, lies, and money laundering operation they are running through their cult. David is using religion to manipulate people emotionally, sexually, spiritually \u0026 financially. Over the last 33 years David E. Taylor has used his cunning and guile to double cross brainwashed followers into giving him hundreds of millions of dollars so he can live his lavish lifestyle. However, there is a deeper and darker dynamic to this very dangerous religous cult that needs to be examined under a microscope. One of the reasons being, David still makes claims to this day that he has seen Jesus well over a 1,000 times and speaks to god on a daily basis. David also claims he has healed cancer, raised the dead, healed the sick, grown back severed limbs, and his most outrageous claim that he cleared an entire hospitals of sick people. These claims of course are all baseless that have absolutely no scientific proof or proof from doctors to validate these occurrences. Youtube is allowing David operate his money laundering scam by letting him purchase his views and subscribers on the platform, thus he continues to manipulate people into donating their last dollar to him so that he can fund a lavish lifestyle. If you would like to help stop this cult please help by filing fraud reports to the #IRS linked in the channel description. It is anonymous and no one will know who has filed a report including the channel owner.

Over the last several years Kathryn has managed to blow through millions of dollars of donor money without spending on a static location in Los Angeles. After the Daystar debacle Kathryn has continued to slip into deeper delusions that she is a true prophet of God, but there is no proof of her being anointed.

These depositions show the true depths of David E. Taylor \u0026 Michelle Brannons\u0027 scams, lies, and money laundering operation they are running through their cult. David is using religion to manipulate people emotionally, sexually, spiritually \u0026 financially. Over the last 33 years David E. Taylor has used his cunning and guile to double cross brainwashed followers into giving him hundreds of millions of dollars so he can live his lavish lifestyle. However, there is a deeper and darker dynamic to this very dangerous religous cult that needs to be examined under a microscope. One of the reasons being, David still makes claims to this day that he has seen Jesus well over a 1,000 times and speaks to god on a daily basis. David also claims he has healed cancer, raised the dead, healed the sick, grown back severed limbs, and his most outrageous claim that he cleared an entire hospitals of sick people. These claims of course are all baseless that have absolutely no scientific proof or proof from doctors to validate these occurrences. Youtube is allowing David operate his money laundering scam by letting him purchase his views and subscribers on the platform, thus he continues to manipulate people into donating their last dollar to him so that he can fund a lavish lifestyle. If you would like to help stop this cult please help by filing fraud reports to the #IRS linked in the channel description. It is anonymous and no one will know who has filed a report including the channel owner. All the information has been filled in for you on the report to make it as quick and easy as possible, as I know time is precious to everyone. Please help us stop these destructive cults and their leaders from destroying anymore lives by having their tax exempt status removed. Once David E.

These depositions show the true depths of David E. Taylor \u0026 Michelle Brannons\u0027 scams, lies, and money laundering operation they are running through their cult. David is using religion to manipulate people emotionally, sexually, spiritually \u0026 financially. Over the last 33 years David E.

However, there is a deeper and darker dynamic to this very dangerous religous cult that needs to be examined under a microscope. One of the reasons being, David still makes claims to this day that he has seen Jesus well over a 1,000 times and speaks to god on a daily basis. David also claims he has healed cancer, raised the dead, healed the sick, grown back severed limbs, and his most outrageous claim that he cleared an entire hospitals of sick people. These claims of course are all baseless that have absolutely no scientific proof or proof from doctors to validate these occurrences. Youtube is allowing David operate his money laundering scam by letting him purchase his views and subscribers on the platform, thus he continues to manipulate people into donating their last dollar to him so that he can fund a lavish lifestyle.

However, there is a deeper and darker dynamic to this very dangerous religous cult that needs to be examined under a microscope. One of the reasons being, David still makes claims to this day that he has seen Jesus well over a 1,000 times and speaks to god on a daily basis. David also claims he has healed cancer, raised the dead, healed the sick, grown back severed limbs, and his most outrageous claim that he cleared an entire hospitals of sick people. These claims of course are all baseless that have absolutely no scientific proof or proof from doctors to validate these occurrences. Youtube is allowing David operate his money laundering scam by letting him purchase his views and subscribers on the platform, thus he continues to manipulate people into donating their last dollar to him so that he can fund a lavish lifestyle. If you would like to help stop this cult please help by filing fraud reports to the #IRS linked in the channel description. It is anonymous and no one will know who has filed a report including the channel owner. All the information has been filled in for you on the report to make it as quick and easy as possible, as I know time is precious to everyone. Please help us stop these destructive cults and their leaders from destroying anymore lives by having their tax exempt status removed. Once David E.

However, there is a deeper and darker dynamic to this very dangerous religous cult that needs to be examined under a microscope.

David also claims he has healed cancer, raised the dead, healed the sick, grown back severed limbs, and his most outrageous claim that he cleared an entire hospitals of sick people. These claims of course are all baseless that have absolutely no scientific proof or proof from doctors to validate these occurrences.

Taylor, Michelle Brannon, JMMI, KOGGC, \u0026 Marvels in America World Healing cult. In 2014 \u0026 2015 a set of depositions were taken that were eventually released in 2017 by Rick Frazier. These depositions show the true depths of David E. Taylor \u0026 Michelle Brannons\u0027 scams, lies, and money laundering operation they are running through their cult. David is using religion to manipulate people emotionally, sexually, spiritually \u0026 financially. Over the last 33 years David E. Taylor has used his cunning and guile to double cross brainwashed followers into giving him hundreds of millions of dollars so he can live his lavish lifestyle. However, there is a deeper and darker dynamic to this very dangerous religous cult that needs to be examined under a microscope. One of the reasons being, David still makes claims to this day that he has seen Jesus well over a 1,000 times and speaks to god on a daily basis. David also claims he has healed cancer, raised the dead, healed the sick, grown back severed limbs, and his most outrageous claim that he cleared an entire hospitals of sick people. These claims of course are all baseless that have absolutely no scientific proof or proof from doctors to validate these occurrences. Youtube is allowing David operate his money laundering scam by letting him purchase his views and subscribers on the platform, thus he continues to manipulate people into donating their last dollar to him so that he can fund a lavish lifestyle. If you would like to help stop this cult please help by filing fraud reports to the #IRS linked in the channel description. It is anonymous and no one will know who has filed a report including the channel owner. All the information has been filled in for you on the report to make it as quick and easy as possible, as I know time is precious to everyone. Please help us stop these destructive cults and their leaders from destroying anymore lives by having their tax exempt status removed. Once David E. Taylors cult has been disbanded by the government our group will make a collective decision to move onto the next. There will be 0 TOLERANCE for racism, sexism, any of this isms on this channel!!! DON\u0027T BE THAT PERSON!!!  If you would like to contact me privately about a cult experience I have those means also available in my channel description. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/ApostleDavidETaylorCultWatchJMMI?si=ELPmzJkDCLju2KnD5oyZMQ\n\n @apostledavidetaylorcultwatch   @agentsmith5857   @DavidETaylorMiraclesinAmerica   @apostledavide.taylormiracl2024   @michellebrannon2228   @michellebrannon1894   @kprchanel9255   @KHOU   @HHS   @TheKrickReport   @ApostleKathrynKrick   @AlexanderPaganiMinistries   @TheSupernaturalLifeDanielAdams   @MikeSignorelli_   @IsaiahSaldivar   @isaiahsaldivarclips   @fbi   @fox26houston   @FOX2Detroit   @fox2stlouis   @fox13tampa   @10TampaBay   @buccaneers   @Boeing  @eaglesflyinninc.9336   @houstonpolice   @HarriscountysoOrg   @TxDeptPublicSafety   @TexasDSHS   @TexasDADSVideo   @DeptVetAffairs   @americanveteranscenter   @msnbc   @CNN   @FoxNews   @DatelineNBC   @boblarsonexorcism   @ProphetLovy   @HoustonChronicle   @houstonchronicle9045   @HoustonChristianUniversity\n\n#koggc #fivefoldministry #fivefold #kathrynkrick #jmmi #davidetaylor #danieladams #isaiahsaldivar #5f #kathrynkrick #falseprophet #falsepreacher #fakeittillyoumakeit #fakers #conartist #scamawareness #scam #scammers #scammerwebsite #god #greed #sociopaths #narcissism #narcissist #narcissistic #wannabe #faith #moneylaundering #taxevasion #taxes #bankruptcy #bankrupt #crime #truecrime #cult #cultsandextremebeliefs #irs #pulpitpimp #pulpit #church #jesus #jesuschrist #jesussaves",

There are allegations of systematic child abuse and coverups within these Christian tv networks year after year, yet Christians still feel the need to donate their last dime to these people in order to get into heaven. This couldn\u0027t be farther from the truth, there is no fee to get into heaven as these people want you to think.

These claims of course are all baseless that have absolutely no scientific proof or proof from doctors to validate these occurrences.

David is using religion to manipulate people emotionally, sexually, spiritually \u0026 financially. Over the last 33 years David E. Taylor has used his cunning and guile to double cross brainwashed followers into giving him hundreds of millions of dollars so he can live his lavish lifestyle. However, there is a deeper and darker dynamic to this very dangerous religous cult that needs to be examined under a microscope. One of the reasons being, David still makes claims to this day that he has seen Jesus well over a 1,000 times and speaks to god on a daily basis. David also claims he has healed cancer, raised the dead, healed the sick, grown back severed limbs, and his most outrageous claim that he cleared an entire hospitals of sick people. These claims of course are all baseless that have absolutely no scientific proof or proof from doctors to validate these occurrences. Youtube is allowing David operate his money laundering scam by letting him purchase his views and subscribers on the platform, thus he continues to manipulate people into donating their last dollar to him so that he can fund a lavish lifestyle. If you would like to help stop this cult please help by filing fraud reports to the #IRS linked in the channel description. It is anonymous and no one will know who has filed a report including the channel owner. All the information has been filled in for you on the report to make it as quick and easy as possible, as I know time is precious to everyone. Please help us stop these destructive cults and their leaders from destroying anymore lives by having their tax exempt status removed. Once David E. Taylors cult has been disbanded by the government our group will make a collective decision to move onto the next. There will be 0 TOLERANCE for racism, sexism, any of this isms on this channel!!! DON\u0027T BE THAT PERSON!!!  If you would like to contact me privately about a cult experience I have those means also available in my channel description. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/ApostleDavidETaylorCultWatchJMMI?si=ELPmzJkDCLju2KnD5oyZMQ\n\n @apostledavidetaylorcultwatch   @agentsmith5857   @DavidETaylorMiraclesinAmerica   @apostledavide.taylormiracl2024   @michellebrannon2228   @michellebrannon1894   @kprchanel9255   @KHOU   @HHS   @TheKrickReport   @ApostleKathrynKrick   @AlexanderPaganiMinistries   @TheSupernaturalLifeDanielAdams   @MikeSignorelli_   @IsaiahSaldivar   @isaiahsaldivarclips   @fbi   @fox26houston   @FOX2Detroit   @fox2stlouis   @fox13tampa   @10TampaBay   @buccaneers   @Boeing  @eaglesflyinninc.9336   @houstonpolice   @HarriscountysoOrg   @TxDeptPublicSafety   @TexasDSHS   @TexasDADSVideo   @DeptVetAffairs   @americanveteranscenter   @msnbc   @CNN   @FoxNews   @DatelineNBC   @boblarsonexorcism   @ProphetLovy   @HoustonChronicle   @houstonchronicle9045   @HoustonChristianUniversity\n\n#koggc #fivefoldministry #fivefold #kathrynkrick #jmmi #davidetaylor #danieladams #isaiahsaldivar #5f #kathrynkrick #falseprophet #falsepreacher #fakeittillyoumakeit #fakers #conartist #scamawareness #scam #scammers #scammerwebsite #god #greed #sociopaths #narcissism #narcissist #narcissistic #wannabe #faith #moneylaundering #taxevasion #taxes #bankruptcy #bankrupt #crime #truecrime #cult #cultsandextremebeliefs #irs #pulpitpimp #pulpit #church #jesus #jesuschrist #jesussaves",

The cost of corporate Christianity is very clear with these major TV networks. All they care about is their cash flow and their own well-being. There will be more of these so-called Christian TV networks that will soon follow suit about systematic abuse.

These claims of course are all baseless that have absolutely no scientific proof or proof from doctors to validate these occurrences.

Taylor, Michelle Brannon, JMMI, KOGGC, \u0026 Marvels in America World Healing cult. In 2014 \u0026 2015 a set of depositions were taken that were eventually released in 2017 by Rick Frazier. These depositions show the true depths of David E. Taylor \u0026 Michelle Brannons\u0027 scams, lies, and money laundering operation they are running through their cult. David is using religion to manipulate people emotionally, sexually, spiritually \u0026 financially. Over the last 33 years David E. Taylor has used his cunning and guile to double cross brainwashed followers into giving him hundreds of millions of dollars so he can live his lavish lifestyle. However, there is a deeper and darker dynamic to this very dangerous religous cult that needs to be examined under a microscope. One of the reasons being, David still makes claims to this day that he has seen Jesus well over a 1,000 times and speaks to god on a daily basis. David also claims he has healed cancer, raised the dead, healed the sick, grown back severed limbs, and his most outrageous claim that he cleared an entire hospitals of sick people. These claims of course are all baseless that have absolutely no scientific proof or proof from doctors to validate these occurrences. Youtube is allowing David operate his money laundering scam by letting him purchase his views and subscribers on the platform, thus he continues to manipulate people into donating their last dollar to him so that he can fund a lavish lifestyle. If you would like to help stop this cult please help by filing fraud reports to the #IRS linked in the channel description. It is anonymous and no one will know who has filed a report including the channel owner. All the information has been filled in for you on the report to make it as quick and easy as possible, as I know time is precious to everyone. Please help us stop these destructive cults and their leaders from destroying anymore lives by having their tax exempt status removed. Once David E. Taylors cult has been disbanded by the government our group will make a collective decision to move onto the next. There will be 0 TOLERANCE for racism, sexism, any of this isms on this channel!!! DON\u0027T BE THAT PERSON!!!  If you would like to contact me privately about a cult experience I have those means also available in my channel description. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/ApostleDavidETaylorCultWatchJMMI?si=ELPmzJkDCLju2KnD5oyZMQ\n\n @apostledavidetaylorcultwatch   @agentsmith5857   @DavidETaylorMiraclesinAmerica   @apostledavide.taylormiracl2024   @michellebrannon2228   @michellebrannon1894   @kprchanel9255   @KHOU   @HHS   @TheKrickReport   @ApostleKathrynKrick   @AlexanderPaganiMinistries   @TheSupernaturalLifeDanielAdams   @MikeSignorelli_   @IsaiahSaldivar   @isaiahsaldivarclips   @fbi   @fox26houston   @FOX2Detroit   @fox2stlouis   @fox13tampa   @10TampaBay   @buccaneers   @Boeing  @eaglesflyinninc.9336   @houstonpolice   @HarriscountysoOrg   @TxDeptPublicSafety   @TexasDSHS   @TexasDADSVideo   @DeptVetAffairs   @americanveteranscenter   @msnbc   @CNN   @FoxNews   @DatelineNBC   @boblarsonexorcism   @ProphetLovy   @HoustonChronicle   @houstonchronicle9045   @HoustonChristianUniversity\n\n#koggc #fivefoldministry #fivefold #kathrynkrick #jmmi #davidetaylor #danieladams #isaiahsaldivar #5f #kathrynkrick #falseprophet #falsepreacher #fakeittillyoumakeit #fakers #conartist #scamawareness #scam #scammers #scammerwebsite #god #greed #sociopaths #narcissism #narcissist #narcissistic #wannabe #faith #moneylaundering #taxevasion #taxes #bankruptcy #bankrupt #crime #truecrime #cult #cultsandextremebeliefs #irs #pulpitpimp #pulpit #church #jesus #jesuschrist #jesussaves",

Taylor, Michelle Brannon, JMMI, KOGGC, \u0026 Marvels in America World Healing cult. In 2014 \u0026 2015 a set of depositions were taken that were eventually released in 2017 by Rick Frazier. These depositions show the true depths of David E. Taylor \u0026 Michelle Brannons\u0027 scams, lies, and money laundering operation they are running through their cult. David is using religion to manipulate people emotionally, sexually, spiritually \u0026 financially. Over the last 33 years David E. Taylor has used his cunning and guile to double cross brainwashed followers into giving him hundreds of millions of dollars so he can live his lavish lifestyle. However, there is a deeper and darker dynamic to this very dangerous religous cult that needs to be examined under a microscope. One of the reasons being, David still makes claims to this day that he has seen Jesus well over a 1,000 times and speaks to god on a daily basis. David also claims he has healed cancer, raised the dead, healed the sick, grown back severed limbs, and his most outrageous claim that he cleared an entire hospitals of sick people. These claims of course are all baseless that have absolutely no scientific proof or proof from doctors to validate these occurrences. Youtube is allowing David operate his money laundering scam by letting him purchase his views and subscribers on the platform, thus he continues to manipulate people into donating their last dollar to him so that he can fund a lavish lifestyle. If you would like to help stop this cult please help by filing fraud reports to the #IRS linked in the channel description. It is anonymous and no one will know who has filed a report including the channel owner. All the information has been filled in for you on the report to make it as quick and easy as possible, as I know time is precious to everyone. Please help us stop these destructive cults and their leaders from destroying anymore lives by having their tax exempt status removed. Once David E.

Taylor, Michelle Brannon, JMMI \u0026 KOGGC cult. The depositions that were released in 2017 show the tip of the iceberg of Davids\u2019 scam \u0026 lies. He has used lies to manipulate people into giving him millions of dollars, and also claims to this day that he sees and speaks to God on a daily basis. David also claims he has healed cancer, brought the dead to life, healed severed limbs, and cleared an entire hospital of sick people. These are all baseless claims that have no proof to them. YouTube allows David and other greedy so-called \u0022Pastors\u0022 to operate on the platform, thus they continue to manipulate people into donating their last dollar to them so they can live a lavish lifestyle at the donor expense. If you would like to help stop some of these corrupt churches and cults, please help by filing fraud reports linked below. Once Davids cult has been brought down, we will move onto the next, and so on.

These depositions show the true depths of David E. Taylor \u0026 Michelle Brannons\u0027 scams, lies, and money laundering operation they are running through their cult. David is using religion to manipulate people emotionally, sexually, spiritually \u0026 financially. Over the last 33 years David E. Taylor has used his cunning and guile to double cross brainwashed followers into giving him hundreds of millions of dollars so he can live his lavish lifestyle. However, there is a deeper and darker dynamic to this very dangerous religous cult that needs to be examined under a microscope. One of the reasons being, David still makes claims to this day that he has seen Jesus well over a 1,000 times and speaks to god on a daily basis. David also claims he has healed cancer, raised the dead, healed the sick, grown back severed limbs, and his most outrageous claim that he cleared an entire hospitals of sick people. These claims of course are all baseless that have absolutely no scientific proof or proof from doctors to validate these occurrences. Youtube is allowing David operate his money laundering scam by letting him purchase his views and subscribers on the platform, thus he continues to manipulate people into donating their last dollar to him so that he can fund a lavish lifestyle. If you would like to help stop this cult please help by filing fraud reports to the #IRS linked in the channel description. It is anonymous and no one will know who has filed a report including the channel owner. All the information has been filled in for you on the report to make it as quick and easy as possible, as I know time is precious to everyone. Please help us stop these destructive cults and their leaders from destroying anymore lives by having their tax exempt status removed. Once David E.

These depositions show the true depths of David E. Taylor \u0026 Michelle Brannons\u0027 scams, lies, and money laundering operation they are running through their cult. David is using religion to manipulate people emotionally, sexually, spiritually \u0026 financially. Over the last 33 years David E. Taylor has used his cunning and guile to double cross brainwashed followers into giving him hundreds of millions of dollars so he can live his lavish lifestyle. However, there is a deeper and darker dynamic to this very dangerous religous cult that needs to be examined under a microscope. One of the reasons being, David still makes claims to this day that he has seen Jesus well over a 1,000 times and speaks to god on a daily basis. David also claims he has healed cancer, raised the dead, healed the sick, grown back severed limbs, and his most outrageous claim that he cleared an entire hospitals of sick people. These claims of course are all baseless that have absolutely no scientific proof or proof from doctors to validate these occurrences. Youtube is allowing David operate his money laundering scam by letting him purchase his views and subscribers on the platform, thus he continues to manipulate people into donating their last dollar to him so that he can fund a lavish lifestyle.

These depositions show the true depths of David E. Taylor \u0026 Michelle Brannons\u0027 scams, lies, and money laundering operation they are running through their cult. David is using religion to manipulate people emotionally, sexually, spiritually \u0026 financially. Over the last 33 years David E. Taylor has used his cunning and guile to double cross brainwashed followers into giving him hundreds of millions of dollars so he can live his lavish lifestyle. However, there is a deeper and darker dynamic to this very dangerous religous cult that needs to be examined under a microscope. One of the reasons being, David still makes claims to this day that he has seen Jesus well over a 1,000 times and speaks to god on a daily basis. David also claims he has healed cancer, raised the dead, healed the sick, grown back severed limbs, and his most outrageous claim that he cleared an entire hospitals of sick people. These claims of course are all baseless that have absolutely no scientific proof or proof from doctors to validate these occurrences. Youtube is allowing David operate his money laundering scam by letting him purchase his views and subscribers on the platform, thus he continues to manipulate people into donating their last dollar to him so that he can fund a lavish lifestyle.

Taylor, Michelle Brannon, JMMI, KOGGC, \u0026 Marvels in America World Healing cult. In 2014 \u0026 2015 a set of depositions were taken that were eventually released in 2017 by Rick Frazier. These depositions show the true depths of David E. Taylor \u0026 Michelle Brannons\u0027 scams, lies, and money laundering operation they are running through their cult. David is using religion to manipulate people emotionally, sexually, spiritually \u0026 financially. Over the last 33 years David E. Taylor has used his cunning and guile to double cross brainwashed followers into giving him hundreds of millions of dollars so he can live his lavish lifestyle. However, there is a deeper and darker dynamic to this very dangerous religous cult that needs to be examined under a microscope. One of the reasons being, David still makes claims to this day that he has seen Jesus well over a 1,000 times and speaks to god on a daily basis. David also claims he has healed cancer, raised the dead, healed the sick, grown back severed limbs, and his most outrageous claim that he cleared an entire hospitals of sick people. These claims of course are all baseless that have absolutely no scientific proof or proof from doctors to validate these occurrences. Youtube is allowing David operate his money laundering scam by letting him purchase his views and subscribers on the platform, thus he continues to manipulate people into donating their last dollar to him so that he can fund a lavish lifestyle. If you would like to help stop this cult please help by filing fraud reports to the #IRS linked in the channel description. It is anonymous and no one will know who has filed a report including the channel owner. All the information has been filled in for you on the report to make it as quick and easy as possible, as I know time is precious to everyone. Please help us stop these destructive cults and their leaders from destroying anymore lives by having their tax exempt status removed. Once David E. Taylors cult has been disbanded by the government our group will make a collective decision to move onto the next. There will be 0 TOLERANCE for racism, sexism, any of this isms on this channel!!!

Taylor, Michelle Brannon, JMMI, KOGGC, \u0026 Marvels in America World Healing cult. In 2014 \u0026 2015 a set of depositions were taken that were eventually released in 2017 by Rick Frazier. These depositions show the true depths of David E. Taylor \u0026 Michelle Brannons\u0027 scams, lies, and money laundering operation they are running through their cult. David is using religion to manipulate people emotionally, sexually, spiritually \u0026 financially. Over the last 33 years David E. Taylor has used his cunning and guile to double cross brainwashed followers into giving him hundreds of millions of dollars so he can live his lavish lifestyle. However, there is a deeper and darker dynamic to this very dangerous religous cult that needs to be examined under a microscope. One of the reasons being, David still makes claims to this day that he has seen Jesus well over a 1,000 times and speaks to god on a daily basis. David also claims he has healed cancer, raised the dead, healed the sick, grown back severed limbs, and his most outrageous claim that he cleared an entire hospitals of sick people. These claims of course are all baseless that have absolutely no scientific proof or proof from doctors to validate these occurrences. Youtube is allowing David operate his money laundering scam by letting him purchase his views and subscribers on the platform, thus he continues to manipulate people into donating their last dollar to him so that he can fund a lavish lifestyle. If you would like to help stop this cult please help by filing fraud reports to the #IRS linked in the channel description. It is anonymous and no one will know who has filed a report including the channel owner. All the information has been filled in for you on the report to make it as quick and easy as possible, as I know time is precious to everyone. Please help us stop these destructive cults and their leaders from destroying anymore lives by having their tax exempt status removed. Once David E. Taylors cult has been disbanded by the government our group will make a collective decision to move onto the next. There will be 0 TOLERANCE for racism, sexism, any of this isms on this channel!!!
