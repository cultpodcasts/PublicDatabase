      "description": "Braille Skateboarding was once an unstoppable skateboarding channel, who suffered possibly the strangest downfall in YouTube history. At the centre of everything seemed to be a weird reliance on scientology, which heavily contributed to the channel\u0027s eventual fall. What went wrong?\n\nThis is, How Scientology Destroyed A Popular Skateboarding Channel\n\nThank you guys for watching, like and sub if you enjoyed, SunnyV2\n\nAlso, the idea for this video was inspired by \u0022Dumb Data\u0022 who posted a video on a similar topic in January 2024 titled \u0022Aaron Kyro, and the Rise and Fall of Braille Skateboarding\u0027s YouTube Channel\u0022 You can watch his version here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GIyKIlL9g\u0026t=672s",
