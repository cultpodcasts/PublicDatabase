      "description": "In 1891, a suffragist and social reformer named Alzire Chevaillier launched a moral crusade to destroy Fountaingrove, a utopian spiritualist community in northern California. Chevaillier accused the colony\u2019s leader, the poet and prophet Thomas Lake Harris, of perverting the teachings of the Bible to promote a \u201Cnew sexology\u201D that was \u201Cworse than Mormonism.\u201D Media reports emphasized the presence of Japanese immigrant men at Fountaingrove, raising racialized specters of miscegenation and moral contamination. The international scandal, full of the sorts of salacious details prized by newspaper editors at the dawn of the era of yellow journalism, would last more than a decade, establishing Harris as the prototype for a new type of public menace-the \u201CCalifornia cult leader.\u201D\n\nUnholy Sensations takes a close-up look at the Fountaingrove scandal to examine religion, gender, sexuality, and race in the Gilded Age from a fresh perspective. By showing that the term \u201Ccult\u201D has always been a marker of race, sexuality, and religion, Unholy Sensations reveals the limits of American freedom and the centrality of religion to the policing of whiteness, family, and nation.\n\nAn in-person and virtual presentation by Joshua Paddison, author and Associate Professor of Instruction, Texas State University",
