      "title": "Friday Night Special:  \u0027PORNY\u0027 MORMON DENTIST MURDERS WIFE,  BIZARRE TWISTS LEADING TO START OF TRIAL",
      "description": "The lead up to James Craig\u2019s trial has been bizarre.....two postponements, three different attorney teams, five added charges and a crazy action from an attorney, who allegedly set his own house on fire. Still, the Aurora dentist\u2019s trial finally got underway yesterday. Craig faces six felony counts: Murder in the first degree Two counts of solicitation to commit tampering with physical evidence Three counts of solicitation to commit perjury in the first degree Court Documents show Craig, jailed on a murder charge of his wife, Angela Craig, still allegedly worked to convince inmates, a former mistress and even one of his own children to tamper with evidence, to plant it to make it look like Angela Craig wanted to kill herself. Prosecutors say James Craig even made a botched murder-for-hire attempt on the case\u2019s lead detective just before a second attempt at trial last year. Craig allegedly offered people cash and dental work in return for a coverup . Craig insists he ordered poison because she asked him to. James Craig and his wife Angela were married for over 20 years. They created a beautiful family of six, loving, happy family, happy children. Between work and taking care of their children, the Craigs still manage to fit a workout into their daily routine. The husband and wife go for a run or hit the gym together almost every day, and when they return home, James Craig makes protein shakes or fruit smoothies for breakfast while Angela delves into getting the kids ready for the day. Angela complains of having a really nasty headache, along with problems focusing her eyesight. She goes to the hospital saying she felt tingly and cold. Doctors cannot figure out what\u0027s wrong with her. Angela goes to the hospital multiple times, only to be sent home. When she goes back for a third time, that\u0027s when she\u0027s checked in and her condition deteriorates, coding quickly. Angela passes away. One of Summer Brooks\u2019 dental assistants recalls opening a package for Dr. Craig\u2014that had potassium cyanide in it. She googles the symptoms of cyanide poisoning, and is horrified at how closely they match Angela\u2019s symptoms. She immediately calls Craig\u2019s partner, Ryan Redfearn, hoping he has some other explanation for the contents of the package...but he doesn\u2019t. While visiting Angela, Redfearn tells a nurse about the cyanide, explaining there\u2019s no medical use for the element in their practice. As a mandatory reporter, the nurse calls police. With suspicions raised, Angela Craig is sent for an autopsy with additional toxicology screening. Tests reveal the otherwise healthy mom of six died of poisoning from both cyanide and tetrahydrozoline, a common ingredient in eyedrops. While investigators have no definitive evidence Angela\u2019s food and drinks were poisoned with cyanide, the tests reveal her cyanide levels increased while she was in the hospital. Police then check Craig\u0027s computer finding strange searches. One of them was how to poison someone, how to make poison and top five or top 10 undetectable poisons that people won\u0027t be able to find after someone has died and will not signal foul play. Less than 24 hours after his wife\u2019s death, dentist James Toliver Craig is arrested for Angela\u2019s murder and additionally charged with tampering with evidence. A 52-page arrest affidavit details Craig\u2019s concerning computer searches, three poison orders, an ongoing affair, and proof Craig took several measures to cover his tracks. Police then learn the dentist allegedly tried to hire his cellmate to kill Aurora PD\u2019s lead detective Bobbi Jo Olson for $20,000. Calling Olson the \u201Cworst, dirtiest detective,\u201D James Craig tried to recruit Nathaniel Harris to take her out for cash or free dental work. Olson wasn\u2019t the only person on his list. Craig also asked Harris to kill another Aurora PD officer and two inmates \u2018Roger\u2019 and \u2018Tommy.\u2019 Joining Nancy Grace today: Eric Faddis - Trial Lawyer and TV Legal Analyst, Founding Partner of Varner Faddis Elite Legal, former felony prosecutor and current criminal defense and civil litigation attorney Dr. Shavaun Scott - Psychotherapist, Author of \u201CThe Minds of Mass Killers: Understanding and Interrupting the Pathway to Violence\u201D Fil Waters - Former homicide detective for the Houston police department, President \u0026 CEO of Kindred spirits Investigations \u0026 Security, Inc., kindredspiritsinvestigations.com Dr Ernest Chiodo - Attorney, Physician, Biomedical Engineer, Toxicologist, Author: \u201CToxic Tort: Medical and Legal Elements\u201D, www.ernestpchiodo.com Steffan Tubbs - Host: \u0027Arsenic, DDS - The Bizarre Case of Dr. James Craig\u0027; Former patient of James Craig See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",

      "description": "Sean \u0027Diddy\u0027 Combs, disgraced music mogul, begins a new fight for a lighter sentence. It remains unclear when the rapper will learn his punishment. Currently, Combs is preparing for his sentencing, which is scheduled for October 3, 2025. Combs was sent back to jail to await sentencing after a dramatic verdict day that saw him cleared of the most serious charges he faced\u2014a partial victory. However, he was found guilty of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. It remains uncertain how much longer the disgraced rapper\u2014who has already spent nine months in jail\u2014may remain behind bars following his sentencing. Diddy has not been seen in public since September 2024, after his arrest on charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution. His attorneys told the judge that he is willing to comply with the strictest bail conditions, especially after enduring ten grueling months in Brooklyn\u2019s Metropolitan Detention Center, where he is housed with high-profile inmates such as Luigi Mangione and Sam Bankman-Fried. Combs\u2019 trial has been explosive, featuring bizarre sexual testimony, explicit videos, and references to some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest names. A central figure in the trial was Cassie, Diddy\u2019s ex-girlfriend and the state\u2019s star witness, who testified while visibly pregnant. See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",

      "description": "Sean \u0027Diddy\u0022 Combs\u0027 legal team drops push for expedited sentencing. Defense attorneys sought to expedite Combs\u0027 sentencing after his verdict last week, but indicated they conferred with federal prosecutors and agree on the original date proposed last week by Judge Subramanian. The decision was made yesterday, Tuesday (July 8) during a virtual quick hearing that was scheduled after Combs\u2019 legal team requested an expedited hearing. Sentencing date set for Sean \u201CDiddy\u201D Combs following his federal conviction, the disgraced rap mogul will learn his fate on Oct. 3, 2025, after being found guilty on two federal counts of transporting women across state lines for prostitution but being found not guilty on the more serious crimes that can carry up to life in prison, racketing and sex trafficking. Combs\u0027 defense team is reportedly pushing for the minimum sentence of 21 to 27 months behind bars. The prosecution, on the other hand, says the sentencing guidelines call for 51 to 63 months and allegedly will likely seek an even longer sentence. Judge Subramanian previously noted the time Combs already spent in jail will count towards his final sentence. The native New Yorker and rap mogul has been jailed since his initial arrest last September and will remain behind bars until his sentencing. See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",

Vallow then faced charges of conspiring to kill Brandon Boudreaux, her niece\u0027s ex-husband. It took a jury less then 30 minutes to convict her in that trial. It was Vallow\u0027s third criminal trial in less than three years. Vallow has been convicted in the deaths of her children, Tylee Ryan and JJ Vallow, and Tammy Daybell, her current husband, Chad Daybell\u2019s, first wife, as well as her former husband Charles. He was killed the morning of July 11. Charles Vallow goes to Lori\u2019s rental home in Chandler, Arizona, to pick up JJ for school. Alex Cox, Lori\u2019s brother, is also there. Within an hour, Vallow is lying in a pool of blood, shot by Alex Cox. Cox claims self-defense and is not charged. East Idaho News Reporter Nate Eaton has been following the case since JJ and Tylee went missing, and interviews Lori Vallow behind bars.

      "description": "Sean \u0022Diddy\u0022 Combs remains in jail after the split verdict in his sex trafficking trial. Next Tuesday, a bail hearing is planned for Combs, who hopes to be released until his October sentencing. Defense attorneys are pushing for a more expedited sentencing, but prosecutors say a pre-sentencing investigation is absolutely necessary in this case. Subramanian also pointed to the stark difference in the defense and prosecution\u2019s sentencing requests as a reason to delay. Prosecutors arguments against bail are simple: detention is mandatory because he violated the Mann Act, and Combs has demonstrated over and over that he will continue to commit crimes despite any brushes with the law. Defense attorneys argue that Combs should be considered an exception to required bail, citing the conditions of the prison and responsibilities as a father and son as reasons for his release. In addition to letters from prosecutors and defense attorneys in regard to a bail decision for Sean Combs, both Cassie Ventura and Deonte Nash write letters begging the judge to consider the safety of those who testified and keep Sean Combs behind bars. Both Ventura and Nash told the judge they feared retribution after taking the stand against the mogul. Nash wrote, \u201CIf he is released now, I have no doubt he will see it as yet another license to continue intimidating, threatening, and harming people who challenge or expose him.\u201D Joining Nancy Grace today: Troy Slaten - Los Angeles Criminal Defense Attorney, Slaten Lawyers; Twitter @TroySlaten Dr. Shari Schwartz -Forensic Psychologist (specializing in Capital Mitigation and Victim Advocacy), www.panthermitigation.com, Twitter: @TrialDoc, Author: \u0022Criminal Behavior\u0022 and \u0022Where Law and Psychology Intersect: Issues in Legal Psychology\u0022 Dr. DeWayne Hendrix - Former Associate Warden at the MDC in Brooklyn, and former Senior Warden with the US Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Founder and President of A New Daylight Foundation, Author: \u0022Who Are You?

      "description": "The lead attorney for Diddy\u0027s powerhouse defense team closes with mixed reviews, as the disgraced rap mogul appears focused, glancing at the juror box as jury instructions are laid out before deliberations begin. Sean \u2018Diddy\u2019 Combs\u2019 lead attorney, Marc Agnifilo, mocks the sex trafficking case in closing arguments, saying the charges \u2018badly exaggerated\u2019 evidence of a swinger lifestyle and threesomes with recreational drug use. Judge Arun Subramanian admonishes Agnifilo after his heavy victim- and state-blaming sarcastic closing arguments. Agnifilo calls Combs\u2019 prosecution a \u201Cfake trial\u201D and ridicules the notion the rap mogul ever engaged in racketeering. Even rival rapper 50 Cent weighs in about closing arguments by Combs\u0027 powerhouse defense lead, calling out Diddy\u0027s lawyer over controversial closing arguments: \u0022They Did Him Dirty.\u0022 As soon as deliberations began, they hit a snag, as one juror apparently can\u2019t follow the judge\u2019s instructions, according to other jurors. Jurors sent the judge a note complaining that one juror may not be playing well with others.

Prosecutor Christy Slavik told jurors that Combs \u0022uses power, violence, and fear to get what he wants,\u0022 adding, \u0022He thought that his fame, wealth, and power put him above the law.\u0022 Slavik cited Ventura Fine\u2019s alleged involvement in several of Combs\u0027 so-called \u0022freak offs\u0022 as an example of the coercion he used during sexual encounters.

Sources say his legal team may use the growing conflict in the Middle East to cast doubt on the federal case against the disgraced rap mogul. The defense may invoke the recent unrest during their closing arguments. Additionally, sources allege that Diddy\u0027s attorneys believe prosecutors have not met the burden of proof required for conviction. They may even choose to rest their case without calling any witnesses after the prosecution concludes, as both sides prepare for closing arguments scheduled for Thursday. Iran recently launched missiles at U.S. bases in the Middle East in retaliation for an earlier U.S. strike under former President Trump.

      "description": "Sean Diddy Combs\u0027 unsettling response to watching \u0027freak-off\u0027 tapes in a private part of court catches the attention of those around him in court. The rap mogul allegedly licks his lips and rubs his hands together after watching a \u0027freak-off\u0027 tape. The disgraced music mogul asks for extra time to watch tapes of his ex-girlfriend, Cassandra Ventura, having sex with male escorts while Combs watched. Diddy\u0027s defense lawyers say the videos prove the rapper was having consensual sex rather than committing crimes. As Diddy\u0027s trial comes to a close, he grants full access to his biggest Hollywood supporter, Kanye West, who is supporting the disgraced rapper. During Kanye\u0027s first appearance, the \u0022gold digger\u0022 rapper was escorted to an overflow room. Combs then adds West to his guest list and reports suggest West may attend the trial again as the defense presents their case. The jury could start deliberating as early as Friday, Sean \u0022Diddy\u0022 Combs\u0027 lawyer, Teny Geragos, tells the judge. Geragos says the defense and prosecution will each take a minimum of four hours delivering closing arguments which may begin as early Thursday.

Vallow has already been convicted in the deaths of her children, Tylee Ryan and JJ Vallow, and Tammy Daybell, her current husband, Chad Daybell\u2019s, first wife, as well as her former husband Charles. On the morning of July 11, Charles Vallow goes to Lori\u2019s rental home in Chandler, Arizona, to pick up JJ for school. Alex Cox, Lori\u2019s brother, is also there. Within an hour, Vallow is lying in a pool of blood, shot by Alex Cox. Cox claims self-defense and is not charged. Later, in June 2021, a Maricopa County Grand Jury charged Lori Vallow with one count of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, in the death of Charles Vallow.

After this two day pause, the government\u0027s case winds down as they bring on their last witness, former assistant to Diddy, Brendan Paul and Diddy\u0027s alleged \u0022drug mule.\u0022 Paul is arrested in March 2024 right around the same time Combs\u0027 homes in Miami and Los Angeles were raided by federal authorities. Paul\u0027s arrest consists of coke and weed-related charges at the Miami-Opa Locka Airport that March. The former assistant\u0027s charges were ultimately dismissed after he completed a pretrial diversion program. Paul was described as a \u0022mule\u0022 for Combs in a 2024 federal lawsuit against the mogul by producer Lil Rod. \u0022He acquires, and distributes, Mr. Combs Drugs, and Guns,\u0022 the suit reads. On the stand, Paul tells jurors he was more than just an assistant, he was Diddy\u2019s go-to man for drugs, including cocaine, ketamine, MDMA (aka \u201Ctusi\u201D), ecstasy, prescription pills, and high-grade weed. When asked about his relationship with Combs, Paul says \u0022 it is complicated.\u0022 Paul testifies to working between 80 and 100 hours a week and the cocaine found on his person at the time of his 2024 arrest was left over from his cleaning of Diddy\u2019s room. Paul claims he personally witnessed the use of coke, ketamine, ecstasy, weed, and more by his former boss, Diddy. See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",

      "description": "A juror\u2019s vertigo halted another day of Sean \u201CDiddy\u201D Combs\u2019 sex trafficking trial before it began. The trial will resume Friday after a break for the Juneteenth holiday on Thursday. Prosecutors had planned to rest their case this week after presenting evidence over six weeks, but the delay means they likely won\u2019t finish until Monday. Combs\u2019 federal racketeering and sex trafficking trial has revealed new details about the disgraced rap mogul. Text messages introduced in court included a surprising item: a list of his favorite sermons. Titled \u201CPD\u2019s Favorite Sermons,\u201D the list was compiled by a YouTube account called \u201CAssistants PD\u201D and surfaced during Jane Doe\u2019s testimony. Another revelation came from one of the civil sex trafficking lawsuits against Combs, which describes his chief of staff, Kristina Khorram, as \u201Cthe Ghislaine Maxwell to Combs\u2019 Jeffrey Epstein.\u201D Prosecutors allege Combs forced Cassie Ventura to take part in so-called \u201Cfreak-offs,\u201D while the defense claims she participated voluntarily. Jurors again watched footage of Combs\u2019 drug-fueled sex parties, with the defense showing longer clips than the prosecution.

      "description": "Jurors in Sean \u0022Diddy\u0022 Combs sex trafficking trial were shown three \u0022freak off\u0022 sex tapes given to the state by Cassie Ventura. Combs mother, sister, and three sons were in the courtroom listening to his ex talk about these orgies. Jurors cringed and some turned their heads. The galley was unable to view the video. Jurors watched on small monitors with headphones. In other testimony, a paralegal specialist with the US Attorney\u0027s Office for the Southern District of New York, Ananya Sankar, said she reviewed the accuracy of the government charts that summarize exhibits. The charts show the jury text messages and other information that haven\u0027t been discussed in testimony, but were submitted into evidence. Among the evidence, texts between Combs staff planning \u0022hotel nights,\u0022 Diddy and Cassie, with Khorram and other staff discussing getting $4,000 cash to the hotel. Khorram tells assistant, Dave Shirley, \u201CHeads up, he\u2019s probably about to do wild king tonight.\u201D Shirley responds, \u0022...need to reup on baby oil\u0022. The jury also sees a text from Khorram to Cassie, \u0022Hi, Dave is at your door with the green\u0022. Prosecutors say they expect to rest their case as early as tomorrow, Wednesday.

      "description": "A major shakeup hits the Sean Combs trial after the judge dismisses a Black male juror. Judge Arun Subramanian says concerns emerged about the juror\u2019s candor after he allegedly gave conflicting statements about his residence. Combs\u2019 defense team vigorously objects to the removal of \u201CJuror 6,\u201D arguing it reduces the panel\u2019s diversity. The dismissed juror is replaced by a 57-year-old alternate\u2014a white accountant from Westchester. Paralegal specialist Ananya Sankar completes cross-examination as jurors review text messages between Sean \u201CDiddy\u201D Combs and his staff about purchasing drugs. In one thread, Combs\u2019 head of security, Faheem Muhammad, receives approval to buy thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of narcotics. Other messages between Chief of Staff Kristina Khorram and Muhammad show Combs once requested 15 MDMA pills, also known as molly or ecstasy.

Combs\u0027 defense has attacked Jane \u201Cup and down\u201D trying to show she agreed to sex acts, by using Combs messages as alleged proof, according to prosecutors.

      "description": "\u0022Jane\u0027s\u0022 testimony continues. She testifies she grew more defiant of Combs\u2019 \u201Chotel nights\u201D when he bragged about his sex life with another woman on a podcast.\n Jane sends several blunt texts the next time Combs asks for a \u201Chotel night\u201D while he\u2019s with another woman. \u201CI don\u2019t want to be used and locked in a room to perform and fulfill your fantasies. I\u2019m not a porn star. I\u2019m not an animal. Coming to the realization of what this really is.\u201D When Combs replies she\u2019s the only one who can bring him peace, Jane snaps back, \u201CIntroduce her to \u2018P.\u2019\u201D \u201D It\u0027s not me; it\u0027s the entertainment that puts you at peace.\u201D\n Jane says her text about \u2018P\u2019 referred to one of their \u201Centertainers,\u201D Paul.\n After their fight about \u201Chotel nights,\u201D Combs promises Jane they can have a weekend in New York, just the two of them. Jane believes Combs and gets on a plane, but not long after takeoff, Combs sends Jane a text about a \u201Csurprise.\u201D When she arrived, an \u201Centertainer\u201D was waiting in their hotel room.\n Combs brushed off Jane\u2019s clear disappointment and anger in the lounge of their hotel, and Jane says she felt so defeated, she agreed to go upstairs with Combs. Just a few days later, Combs decided that night needed a part two and had the New York entertainer meet the couple in Miami.\u00A0\n Jane testifies that the two-part \u201Chotel night\u201D went poorly because of her disappointment and distrust for the \u201Centertainer\u201D Combs chose, so she arranged another hotel night with a man she was more familiar with to \u201Cmake it up\u201D to Combs.\n Jane expresses in later texts to Combs that she had a hand in setting up \u201Chotel nights\u201D and hiring sex workers solely for her own safety against blackmail, pregnancy, and STDs, not because she wanted to participate.\n Jane reads more text messages she sent to Combs the next time he asked to see her for what she assumed would be another hotel night: \u201CSpend the day with your family or Gina; I need time to myself.\u201D\n In response, Combs promised that he wasn\u2019t seeking sex at all and only wanted to spend time with her.\n Jane stood her ground, writing, \u201CYou beat the love out of us. You made it crystal clear exactly what you want me for. You\u2019re going to spend the day love-bombing me so you can get what you want? It\u2019s not genuine. I\u2019ve hit a mental and spiritual wall.\u201D\n \u201CJane\u201D testifies she read Cassie\u2019s lawsuit the second she learned of it\u2014and fainted from shock. Jane says she was reading her own story, about her own sexual trauma, and felt even more betrayed by Combs\u2019 constantly dismissing her reluctance to participate in \u201Chotel nights.\u201D\n Jane immediately confronted Combs about Cassie\u2019s allegations in scathing texts.\n \u201CThe sick part is you knew this was coming, and you gaslit me and made me feel crazy about the sex trauma I was developing, knowing you\u2019ve been here before. It\u2019s all so clear that this was sexual exploitation that you framed as love for your sick fetishes.\u0022\u00A0\n Joining Nancy Grace today: \u00A0\n  Greg Morse - Criminal Defense Attorney of Morse Legal, Author of \u201CThe Untested\u201D [found on Amazon] Dr.\u202FBethany\u202FMarshall -\u00A0 Psychoanalyst, Author: \u0022Deal Breaker,\u0022 and featured in hit show \u0022Paris in Love\u0022 on Peacock; Instagram \u0026 TikTok: drbethanymarshall, X: @DrBethanyLive Chris McDonough -\u00A0 Director At the Cold Case Foundation, Former Homicide Detective [worked over 300 homicides in 25-year career], Trained the first Native American Homicide Task Force; Host of YouTube channel, \u0022The Interview Room\u0022 Dani Pinter - Senior Vice President and Director of Law Center, National Center on Sexual Exploitation Tisa Tells - Pop Culture Investigator \u0026 Commentator and Host of \u0027Tisa Tells\u0027 on YouTube; YouTube: @TisaTells, Instagram \u0026 TikTok: @TisaTellss See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",

      "description": "Sean Combs arranged \u201Chotel nights\u201D in New York, Los Angeles, Miami, and Turks and Caicos, according to testimony from a witness identified as \u201CJane.\u201D She told jurors she relied on Combs\u2019 chief of staff, Kristina Khorram, to arrange travel, while Combs\u2019 assistants prepared the hotel rooms with protective coverings, mood lighting, candles, lubricant, and large quantities of baby oil. She said Combs was obsessed with baby oil and claimed they used up to two dozen bottles during a single \u201Chotel night.\u201D\n Jane testified she met Combs during a girls\u2019 trip to Miami hosted by a friend. Two months later, she planned to return to Miami when Combs offered to pay for her hotel room in exchange for a date.\n In the months that followed, she described a whirlwind of lavish dates and trips. She said Combs frequently offered her ketamine and ecstasy. After a 15-day trip, she said Combs gave her $10,000, saying it was compensation for keeping her away from work. That financial support soon became routine, with Combs eventually taking over her rent payments.\n Jane said that four months into the relationship, Combs asked her to fantasize about another man. In the moment, she agreed. She testified that Combs immediately made calls to arrange a session and, within hours, they were in a hotel suite set up by his assistants. The room was prepared with lighting and protective coverings, she said, and they met \u201CDon,\u201D a man from Cowboys for Angels.\n Believing she was fulfilling a one-time fantasy for her boyfriend, Jane agreed to have sex with Don. But she compared her consent to opening a \u201CPandora\u2019s box\u201D she could no longer close.\n Every meeting that followed involved sex with another man, she said. Although she protested, both verbally and in writing, Combs allegedly threatened to break up with her and cut off financial support if she refused.\n Jurors were reportedly shocked by Jane\u2019s testimony describing what occurred during these \u201Chotel nights.\u201D\n \u00A0 Joining Nancy Grace today:\n  Troy Slaten - Los Angeles Criminal Defense Attorney, Slaten Lawyers, APC; X @TroySlaten Dr.\u202FBethany\u202FMarshall\u00A0-\u00A0 Psychoanalyst, Author: \u0022Deal Breaker,\u0022 and featured in hit show \u0022Paris in Love\u0022 on Peacock; Instagram \u0026 TikTok: drbethanymarshall, X: @DrBethanyLive Tisa Tells - Pop Culture Investigator \u0026 Commentator and Host of \u0027Tisa Tells\u0027 on YouTube; YouTube: @TisaTells, Instagram \u0026 TikTok: @TisaTellss Lynn Shaw -\u00A0 Founder and Executive Director of Lynn\u0027s Warriors, \u202FHost of Lynn\u0027s Warriors on YouTube; \u202FX: @lynns_warriors, YouTube: @LynnsWarriors Rob Shuter - Host: Naughty But Nice Podcast, Former Publicist of Sean Combs, and Author: \u0022The 4 Word Answer;\u0022IG: @naughtygossip Sydney\u202FSumner - Crime Stories \u202FInvestigative\u202FReporter See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",

The judge warned that any further attempts to influence jurors could lead to Combs being ejected.\n Combs\u2019 ex-girlfriend, testifying under the pseudonym \u201CJane,\u201D broke down on the stand as she described drug-fueled sex marathons.

Eddy Garcia, former Intercontinental Hotel Security Guard, briefly took the stand and immediately pled the fifth. Judge Subramanian agreed to grant him immunity for his testimony, as long as he speaks the truth on the stand. The former security officer tells the court Combs paid $100,000 for a copy of the video, which shows Comb\u0027s kicking and dragging Cassie. CNN last year published the security footage. Another witness introduced in opening statements expected to testify this week. \u201CJane,\u201D who alleges Combs drugged and coerced her into participating in Freak Offs by taking control of her finances. Many speculating if Combs\u2019 Chief of Staff, Kristina Khorram will testify, and if she does\u2014for which side.

      "description": "Another victim in Sean \u0022Diddy\u0022 Combs\u0027 sex trafficking trial referred to by a pseudonym, \u201CMia,\u201D former personal assistant to Sean \u201CDiddy\u201D Combs\u2019 and an executive at his film studio, Revolt TV, testifies Combs allegedly sexually assaulted her on multiple occasions.\n Mia states he could become violent, once slamming her into a wall and, on another occasion, throwing her into a pool. She once worked five days straight without sleep and used the drug Adderall to stay awake. \u0022Mia\u0022 was not allowed to lock her bedroom door when staying at Combs\u0027 and could not leave his sight.\n She recalls a confrontation in 2012 when she and Cassie Ventura were barricaded in a beachside room, hiding from an enraged Combs during a vacation in Turks and Caicos, they push furniture against the door to block Combs from entering.\u00A0\n \u00A0\u0022I was looking at Cass and she was screaming for help and, \u0027You have to help me, Puff is going to kill me,\u0027\u0022 \u0022Mia\u0022 recalls. \u0022She is usually chill and calm, and she was terrified.\u0022\n \u0022Mia and Cassie dash out a back door to the beach and out to a paddle board, fleeing into the water, however weather shifted drastically, sky turned black. We were both debating. I was trying to weigh if it was scarier to face Mother Nature or go back to Puff. We eventually went back to Puff.\u0022\n In cross-examination, defense Brian Steel questions Mia on her social media posts with Combs and on her communications with him in which she said, \u201Clove you\u201D and praised him as a \u201Cmentor and inspiration She said there were exciting times in the job and the \u201Chighs were really high, and the lows were really low.\u201D\n Follow Crime Stories with Nancy Grace for the latest in Sean \u0022Diddy\u0022 Combs\u0027 sex trafficking trial.\u00A0\n Joining Nancy Grace today:\n   Troy Slaten - Los Angeles Criminal Defense Attorney, Slaten Lawyers, APC; X @TroySlaten\u00A0\n   Dr.\u202FBethany\u202FMarshall-\u00A0 Psychoanalyst, Author: \u0022Deal Breaker,\u0022 and featured in hit show \u0022Paris in Love\u0022 on Peacock; Instagram \u0026 TikTok: drbethanymarshall, X: @DrBethanyLive\n   Brian Fitzgibbons -\u202FDirector of Operations for USPA Nationwide Security, Leads a team of investigators specializing in locating missing persons;\u00A0Instagram: @uspa_nationwide_security, former Marine and Iraq war veteran\n   Irv Brandt - Former Senior Inspector, US Marshals Service International Investigations Branch, Chief Inspector, DOJ Office of International Affairs; Country Attache, US Embassy Kingston, Jamaica.

      "description": "Kouri Richins\u0027 defense alleges that the Summit County Sheriff\u2019s Office illegally obtained evidence while investigating the death of Eric Richins. Defense attorneys Kathy Nester and Wendy Lewis say detectives violated Richins\u0027 constitutional rights and argue that the evidence should be ruled inadmissible during her murder trial. At the center of the motion are the \u0022Walk the Dog\u0022 letter and data from her phone and Apple accounts. Defense attorneys argue that investigators took Kouri\u2019s phone without a proper warrant and failed to inform her of her right to remain silent, her right to request a lawyer, and her right to refuse questioning. The case began when Eric Richins became violently ill on multiple occasions after having dinner with his wife, Kouri. The couple, who owned a successful real estate business, was celebrating a big sale when Kouri Richins prepared a drink for her husband. She then went to care for their children. Hours later, when she went to bed, Eric Richins was dead. Investigators believe his wife killed him by putting a fatal dose of fentanyl in his drink. Police also discovered that Kouri Richins attempted to change the beneficiary of her husband\u0027s life insurance policy.

      "description": "The full autopsy reports on Veronica Butler and Jillian Kelley have been released. Both reports identify the cause of death as multiple sharp force trauma. The reports list a total of 30 wounds on each victim, including 9 stab wounds and 21 cuts. Many of Butler\u0027s wounds were consistent with defensive injuries. A police affidavit states that Tifany Adams allegedly made statements implicating herself in the deaths of Butler and Kelley. Investigators believe Butler and Kelley were lured to the location, arriving around 9:40 a.m. Officers found pools of blood, Butler\u2019s glasses on the ground, and a broken hammer at the scene. Police believe the women were then forced into another vehicle. The probable cause affidavit contains extensive details, but the women\u2019s causes of death were not initially disclosed. Their bodies were discovered in a cattle pasture leased by Tad Bert Cullum, the boyfriend of Tifany Adams. Cellphone data from three burner phones purchased by Adams helped narrow down the location. The phones first pinged near Butler\u0027s abandoned car, and the data later led police to the pasture. Officers found signs of digging. A hole, which had been refilled, contained the bodies of the two women. Investigators cite a custody battle over Butler\u2019s two children as the motive. The custody dispute had lasted more than five years. Butler\u2019s ex-partner, Wrangler Rickman, who is Adams\u2019 son, had custody of the children. However, Rickman was confirmed to be in a rehabilitation facility in Oklahoma City at the time. Butler was allowed supervised visitation with her children every Saturday. According to her attorney, she was likely to gain unsupervised visitation in an upcoming hearing. The affidavit states, \u201CAdams vehemently opposed this and went to great lengths to plan and purchase items used in Butler and Kelley\u2019s murders.\u201D It continues, \u201CAdams, Cullum, Cole, and Cora were willing to kidnap and murder two victims to limit visitation for Butler.\u201D Court documents also allege that Adams and her accomplices attempted to kill Butler in February. Adams, her boyfriend, and another couple reportedly drove to Butler\u2019s home near Hugoton, Kansas, intending to kill her. A witness told investigators the plan was to throw an anvil through Butler\u2019s windshield to make it appear as an accident, but Butler did not leave her home. State investigators retrieved data from Adams\u2019 phone showing searches for terms such as \u201Ctaser pain level,\u201D \u201Cgun shops,\u201D \u201Cprepaid cellular phones,\u201D and \u201Chow to get someone out of their house.\u201D According to the documents, Adams purchased five stun guns before the women disappeared. She also bought three prepaid burner phones from a nearby Walmart. All the burner phones stopped transmitting on the morning of the women\u2019s disappearance. After the attack, the bodies were reportedly stored in a sealed freezer before being buried 4 to 8 feet underground.

      "description": "Sean Combs is back in the Metropolitan Detention Center after U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter denied his appeal of the remand order. Magistrate Judge Robyn F. Tarnofsky initially denied bail for the rapper on Tuesday, stating that Combs posed a danger and quoting, \u0022I don\u2019t know that you can trust yourself not to harm people.\u0022 In the appeal for monitored house arrest, Combs\u0027 attorney described the conditions at the Brooklyn facility as \u0022horrific\u0022 and \u0022not fit for pre-trial detention.\u0022 The defense proposed that Combs live alone at his Florida home, monitored by a 24/7 security team. Combs offered to relinquish access to his cell phone and the internet. The defense also suggested travel restrictions, noting that Combs had already surrendered his passport to his attorneys months ago. His attorney also holds the passports of Combs\u0027 mother and dependent children. The proposed travel limits would confine Combs to the Southern District of New York and the Southern District of Florida, where he resides and has necessary medical appointments, details of which would be submitted under seal. Attorney Marc Agnifilo\u2019s amended bail package proposed no communication with women outside of direct family members and the mothers of his children, as well as no contact with known grand jury witnesses, specifically referencing \u0022Victim 1,\u0022 Cassandra Ventura. The proposal also included the use of a private intelligence agency to monitor Combs 24/7, ensure he has no access to a cell phone or the internet, administer weekly drug tests, and maintain a daily visitors log. In the end, Judge Andrew Carter, Jr. agreed with Judge Robyn Tarnofsky, stating that \u0022there is no condition or combination of conditions to ensure he will not obstruct justice or tamper with witnesses.\u0022 Sean Combs remains in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn until his trial.

      "description": "The second person charged in the deaths of Tylee Ryan, JJ Vallow, and Tammy Daybell is now in court. Chad Daybell, husband of Cult Mom Lori Vallow, is facing the same charges as his wife and more. Shortly after her husband Charles Vallow\u2019s shooting death, Lori Vallow moves with her two children to Rexburg, Idaho. It\u2019s not far from where Chad Daybell, Vallow\u2019s lover and \u201Chusband from a past life\u201D resides with his wife Tammy Daybell. Tylee Ryan and J.J. Vallow settle in, making a trip to Yellowstone National Park with their mom and uncle Alex Cox. A photo from that trip is the last proof of Tylee\u2019s life, and weeks later, J.J. Vallow stops going to school. Meanwhile, Vallow and Daybell spend more time together. The couple is seen loading a storage unit with Vallow\u2019s children\u2019s belongings. A month passes, and suddenly Daybell\u2019s wife Tammy is dead. Two weeks later, Lori Vallow is now Lori Vallow-Daybell after a wedding ceremony on a Kauai beach. Chad Daybell\u2019s wife Tammy Daybell dies in her sleep at the age of 49. Friends were shocked by her death, saying that Tammy was incredibly fit. The mom of five was training for a marathon and regularly attended high-intensity exercise classes with friends. However, Chad Daybell painted a very different story of his wife\u2019s health. He said Tammy Daybell was sickly, always coughing, and struggling with low blood pressure that led to fainting spells. Daybell said on the night of her death, Tammy Daybell had a coughing fit that led her to vomit. He helped her to bed and was startled awake when Tammy rolled onto the floor. Daybell says when he checked on her, he realized Tammy was dead. Fremont County Coroner, Brenda Dye, took Daybell\u2019s account of his wife\u2019s health into consideration when she ruled Tammy Daybell\u2019s cause of death to be pulmonary edema due to a cardiac event without performing an autopsy. By June of 2020, detectives are narrowing down what happened to J.J. Vallow and Tylee Ryan since their disappearance nearly six months earlier. Lori Vallow-Daybell is behind bars on two felony charges of Desertion \u0026 Nonsupport of Dependent Children after failing to produce Tylee and J.J. in court on January 30. On April 9, police announce their suspicion that Vallow and Vallow-Daybell conspired to kill Tammy Daybell. Rexburg Police return to Chad Daybell\u2019s home for another search. While Daybell is detained, investigators uncover human remains in a pet cemetery in Daybell\u2019s backyard. The remains are later confirmed to be J.J. Vallow and Tylee Ryan.

      "description": "The parents of a 12-year-old boy think Trails Carolina might be just the place to help their son. Trails Carolina claims to be a Leader in Wilderness Therapy offering an Adventure Wilderness Program for children who have behavioral and or emotional difficulties. The parents say their boy is transported by two men from New York to Trails Carolina Camp at Lake Toxaway, North Carolina. Their son arrives at the camp in an agitated state. The 12-year-old is loud and disruptive, but he is assigned to a cabin with other children as well as four adults. In less than 24 hours, the 12-year-old boy from New York is dead. Sheriff Chuck Owenby says an autopsy is being conducted because the death \u0022appeared suspicious\u0022 since the boy died at the camp less than 24 hours after he arrived. A counselor explained to investigators that the boy was required to sleep on the floor inside a sleeping bag. The sleeping bag is inside a small tent called a \u0022BIVY.\u0022 According to search warrant documents, around midnight the boy started to experience a panic attack. After the panic attack, a counselor told investigators that the boy was checked on throughout the night starting at 12 a.m., with additional checks on his well-being at 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. At 7:45 a.m., the boy was found dead. According to the search warrant, when investigators arrived at the scene, CJH was stiff and \u0022cold to the touch.\u0022 He was lying on his back, his arms were on his chest, and his \u0022knees bent upwards toward the sky.\u0022 Also in the search warrant, investigators noted spots of bleeding under the skin, \u0022possible petechiae\u0022 in the boy\u0027s lips and eyes. This is considered a sign of asphyxiation. The warrant also notes a CPR mask was covering the boy\u0027s face and he was not wearing any pants or underwear. His pants and underwear were lying next to his shoulder Early in the investigation, detectives with the Transylvania County Sheriff\u0027s Office attempted to interview other juveniles at Trails Carolina when the boy died. However, camp staff members refused to allow investigators to interview or even see any of the other juveniles. Trails Carolina says the search warrant contains \u0022misleading statements\u0022 saying they won\u0027t discuss some details \u0022out of respect for the family and the investigation.\u0022 In a statement, Trails Carolina says they did not prevent children from speaking to investigators claiming they asked parents for permission for any children involved to speak with law enforcement and state agencies, and \u0022complied with each parent\u0027s preference. as we are required to do.\u0022 Children were moved to the area to protect them from seeing what was happening, not to avoid investigators. In response to the recent suspicious death of a 12-year-old at Trails Carolina, North Carolina health officials ordered the removal of all children from the nature therapy program.
