She once worked five days straight without sleep and used the drug Adderall to stay awake. \u0022Mia\u0022 was not allowed to lock her bedroom door when staying at Combs\u0027 and could not leave his sight.\n She recalls a confrontation in 2012 when she and Cassie Ventura were barricaded in a beachside room, hiding from an enraged Combs during a vacation in Turks and Caicos, they push furniture against the door to block Combs from entering.\u00A0\n \u00A0\u0022I was looking at Cass and she was screaming for help and, \u0027You have to help me, Puff is going to kill me,\u0027\u0022 \u0022Mia\u0022 recalls. \u0022She is usually chill and calm, and she was terrified.\u0022\n \u0022Mia and Cassie dash out a back door to the beach and out to a paddle board, fleeing into the water, however weather shifted drastically, sky turned black. We were both debating. I was trying to weigh if it was scarier to face Mother Nature or go back to Puff. We eventually went back to Puff.\u0022\n In cross-examination, defense Brian Steel questions Mia on her social media posts with Combs and on her communications with him in which she said, \u201Clove you\u201D and praised him as a \u201Cmentor and inspiration She said there were exciting times in the job and the \u201Chighs were really high, and the lows were really low.\u201D\n Follow Crime Stories with Nancy Grace for the latest in Sean \u0022Diddy\u0022 Combs\u0027 sex trafficking trial.\u00A0\n Joining Nancy Grace today:\n   Troy Slaten - Los Angeles Criminal Defense Attorney, Slaten Lawyers, APC; X @TroySlaten\u00A0\n   Dr.\u202FBethany\u202FMarshall-\u00A0 Psychoanalyst, Author: \u0022Deal Breaker,\u0022 and featured in hit show \u0022Paris in Love\u0022 on Peacock; Instagram \u0026 TikTok: drbethanymarshall, X: @DrBethanyLive\n   Brian Fitzgibbons -\u202FDirector of Operations for USPA Nationwide Security, Leads a team of investigators specializing in locating missing persons;\u00A0Instagram: @uspa_nationwide_security, former Marine and Iraq war veteran\n   Irv Brandt - Former Senior Inspector, US Marshals Service International Investigations Branch, Chief Inspector, DOJ Office of International Affairs; Country Attache, US Embassy Kingston, Jamaica.

      "description": "Kouri Richins\u0027 defense alleges that the Summit County Sheriff\u2019s Office illegally obtained evidence while investigating the death of Eric Richins. Defense attorneys Kathy Nester and Wendy Lewis say detectives violated Richins\u0027 constitutional rights and argue that the evidence should be ruled inadmissible during her murder trial. At the center of the motion are the \u0022Walk the Dog\u0022 letter and data from her phone and Apple accounts. Defense attorneys argue that investigators took Kouri\u2019s phone without a proper warrant and failed to inform her of her right to remain silent, her right to request a lawyer, and her right to refuse questioning. The case began when Eric Richins became violently ill on multiple occasions after having dinner with his wife, Kouri. The couple, who owned a successful real estate business, was celebrating a big sale when Kouri Richins prepared a drink for her husband. She then went to care for their children. Hours later, when she went to bed, Eric Richins was dead. Investigators believe his wife killed him by putting a fatal dose of fentanyl in his drink. Police also discovered that Kouri Richins attempted to change the beneficiary of her husband\u0027s life insurance policy.

      "description": "The full autopsy reports on Veronica Butler and Jillian Kelley have been released. Both reports identify the cause of death as multiple sharp force trauma. The reports list a total of 30 wounds on each victim, including 9 stab wounds and 21 cuts. Many of Butler\u0027s wounds were consistent with defensive injuries. A police affidavit states that Tifany Adams allegedly made statements implicating herself in the deaths of Butler and Kelley. Investigators believe Butler and Kelley were lured to the location, arriving around 9:40 a.m. Officers found pools of blood, Butler\u2019s glasses on the ground, and a broken hammer at the scene. Police believe the women were then forced into another vehicle. The probable cause affidavit contains extensive details, but the women\u2019s causes of death were not initially disclosed. Their bodies were discovered in a cattle pasture leased by Tad Bert Cullum, the boyfriend of Tifany Adams. Cellphone data from three burner phones purchased by Adams helped narrow down the location. The phones first pinged near Butler\u0027s abandoned car, and the data later led police to the pasture. Officers found signs of digging. A hole, which had been refilled, contained the bodies of the two women. Investigators cite a custody battle over Butler\u2019s two children as the motive. The custody dispute had lasted more than five years. Butler\u2019s ex-partner, Wrangler Rickman, who is Adams\u2019 son, had custody of the children. However, Rickman was confirmed to be in a rehabilitation facility in Oklahoma City at the time. Butler was allowed supervised visitation with her children every Saturday. According to her attorney, she was likely to gain unsupervised visitation in an upcoming hearing. The affidavit states, \u201CAdams vehemently opposed this and went to great lengths to plan and purchase items used in Butler and Kelley\u2019s murders.\u201D It continues, \u201CAdams, Cullum, Cole, and Cora were willing to kidnap and murder two victims to limit visitation for Butler.\u201D Court documents also allege that Adams and her accomplices attempted to kill Butler in February. Adams, her boyfriend, and another couple reportedly drove to Butler\u2019s home near Hugoton, Kansas, intending to kill her. A witness told investigators the plan was to throw an anvil through Butler\u2019s windshield to make it appear as an accident, but Butler did not leave her home. State investigators retrieved data from Adams\u2019 phone showing searches for terms such as \u201Ctaser pain level,\u201D \u201Cgun shops,\u201D \u201Cprepaid cellular phones,\u201D and \u201Chow to get someone out of their house.\u201D According to the documents, Adams purchased five stun guns before the women disappeared. She also bought three prepaid burner phones from a nearby Walmart. All the burner phones stopped transmitting on the morning of the women\u2019s disappearance. After the attack, the bodies were reportedly stored in a sealed freezer before being buried 4 to 8 feet underground.

      "description": "Sean Combs is back in the Metropolitan Detention Center after U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter denied his appeal of the remand order. Magistrate Judge Robyn F. Tarnofsky initially denied bail for the rapper on Tuesday, stating that Combs posed a danger and quoting, \u0022I don\u2019t know that you can trust yourself not to harm people.\u0022 In the appeal for monitored house arrest, Combs\u0027 attorney described the conditions at the Brooklyn facility as \u0022horrific\u0022 and \u0022not fit for pre-trial detention.\u0022 The defense proposed that Combs live alone at his Florida home, monitored by a 24/7 security team. Combs offered to relinquish access to his cell phone and the internet. The defense also suggested travel restrictions, noting that Combs had already surrendered his passport to his attorneys months ago. His attorney also holds the passports of Combs\u0027 mother and dependent children. The proposed travel limits would confine Combs to the Southern District of New York and the Southern District of Florida, where he resides and has necessary medical appointments, details of which would be submitted under seal. Attorney Marc Agnifilo\u2019s amended bail package proposed no communication with women outside of direct family members and the mothers of his children, as well as no contact with known grand jury witnesses, specifically referencing \u0022Victim 1,\u0022 Cassandra Ventura. The proposal also included the use of a private intelligence agency to monitor Combs 24/7, ensure he has no access to a cell phone or the internet, administer weekly drug tests, and maintain a daily visitors log. In the end, Judge Andrew Carter, Jr. agreed with Judge Robyn Tarnofsky, stating that \u0022there is no condition or combination of conditions to ensure he will not obstruct justice or tamper with witnesses.\u0022 Sean Combs remains in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn until his trial.

      "description": "The second person charged in the deaths of Tylee Ryan, JJ Vallow, and Tammy Daybell is now in court. Chad Daybell, husband of Cult Mom Lori Vallow, is facing the same charges as his wife and more. Shortly after her husband Charles Vallow\u2019s shooting death, Lori Vallow moves with her two children to Rexburg, Idaho. It\u2019s not far from where Chad Daybell, Vallow\u2019s lover and \u201Chusband from a past life\u201D resides with his wife Tammy Daybell. Tylee Ryan and J.J. Vallow settle in, making a trip to Yellowstone National Park with their mom and uncle Alex Cox. A photo from that trip is the last proof of Tylee\u2019s life, and weeks later, J.J. Vallow stops going to school. Meanwhile, Vallow and Daybell spend more time together. The couple is seen loading a storage unit with Vallow\u2019s children\u2019s belongings. A month passes, and suddenly Daybell\u2019s wife Tammy is dead. Two weeks later, Lori Vallow is now Lori Vallow-Daybell after a wedding ceremony on a Kauai beach. Chad Daybell\u2019s wife Tammy Daybell dies in her sleep at the age of 49. Friends were shocked by her death, saying that Tammy was incredibly fit. The mom of five was training for a marathon and regularly attended high-intensity exercise classes with friends. However, Chad Daybell painted a very different story of his wife\u2019s health. He said Tammy Daybell was sickly, always coughing, and struggling with low blood pressure that led to fainting spells. Daybell said on the night of her death, Tammy Daybell had a coughing fit that led her to vomit. He helped her to bed and was startled awake when Tammy rolled onto the floor. Daybell says when he checked on her, he realized Tammy was dead. Fremont County Coroner, Brenda Dye, took Daybell\u2019s account of his wife\u2019s health into consideration when she ruled Tammy Daybell\u2019s cause of death to be pulmonary edema due to a cardiac event without performing an autopsy. By June of 2020, detectives are narrowing down what happened to J.J. Vallow and Tylee Ryan since their disappearance nearly six months earlier. Lori Vallow-Daybell is behind bars on two felony charges of Desertion \u0026 Nonsupport of Dependent Children after failing to produce Tylee and J.J. in court on January 30. On April 9, police announce their suspicion that Vallow and Vallow-Daybell conspired to kill Tammy Daybell. Rexburg Police return to Chad Daybell\u2019s home for another search. While Daybell is detained, investigators uncover human remains in a pet cemetery in Daybell\u2019s backyard. The remains are later confirmed to be J.J. Vallow and Tylee Ryan.

Prosecutors say the Tates and two associates formed an organized criminal group to groom and sexually traffick women in the United States, the United Kingdom, as well as Romania. The indictment names seven women who say the Tate brothers recruited them with false promises, including love and marriage, but instead took them to buildings where they intimidated them, watched over them constantly, forcing them into debt and pornography.

      "title": "Boy, 12, Dead After Just 24 Hours at Wilderness Boot Camp, Found Without Pants",
      "description": "The parents of a 12-year-old boy think Trails Carolina might be just the place to help their son. Trails Carolina claims to be a Leader in Wilderness Therapy offering an Adventure Wilderness Program for children who have behavioral and or emotional difficulties. The parents say their boy is transported by two men from New York to Trails Carolina Camp at Lake Toxaway, North Carolina. Their son arrives at the camp in an agitated state. The 12-year-old is loud and disruptive, but he is assigned to a cabin with other children as well as four adults. In less than 24 hours, the 12-year-old boy from New York is dead. Sheriff Chuck Owenby says an autopsy is being conducted because the death \u0022appeared suspicious\u0022 since the boy died at the camp less than 24 hours after he arrived. A counselor explained to investigators that the boy was required to sleep on the floor inside a sleeping bag. The sleeping bag is inside a small tent called a \u0022BIVY.\u0022 According to search warrant documents, around midnight the boy started to experience a panic attack. After the panic attack, a counselor told investigators that the boy was checked on throughout the night starting at 12 a.m., with additional checks on his well-being at 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. At 7:45 a.m., the boy was found dead. According to the search warrant, when investigators arrived at the scene, CJH was stiff and \u0022cold to the touch.\u0022 He was lying on his back, his arms were on his chest, and his \u0022knees bent upwards toward the sky.\u0022 Also in the search warrant, investigators noted spots of bleeding under the skin, \u0022possible petechiae\u0022 in the boy\u0027s lips and eyes. This is considered a sign of asphyxiation. The warrant also notes a CPR mask was covering the boy\u0027s face and he was not wearing any pants or underwear. His pants and underwear were lying next to his shoulder Early in the investigation, detectives with the Transylvania County Sheriff\u0027s Office attempted to interview other juveniles at Trails Carolina when the boy died. However, camp staff members refused to allow investigators to interview or even see any of the other juveniles. Trails Carolina says the search warrant contains \u0022misleading statements\u0022 saying they won\u0027t discuss some details \u0022out of respect for the family and the investigation.\u0022 In a statement, Trails Carolina says they did not prevent children from speaking to investigators claiming they asked parents for permission for any children involved to speak with law enforcement and state agencies, and \u0022complied with each parent\u0027s preference. as we are required to do.\u0022 Children were moved to the area to protect them from seeing what was happening, not to avoid investigators. In response to the recent suspicious death of a 12-year-old at Trails Carolina, North Carolina health officials ordered the removal of all children from the nature therapy program.
