      "description": "A juror\u2019s vertigo halted another day of Sean \u201CDiddy\u201D Combs\u2019 sex trafficking trial before it began. The trial will resume Friday after a break for the Juneteenth holiday on Thursday. Prosecutors had planned to rest their case this week after presenting evidence over six weeks, but the delay means they likely won\u2019t finish until Monday. Combs\u2019 federal racketeering and sex trafficking trial has revealed new details about the disgraced rap mogul. Text messages introduced in court included a surprising item: a list of his favorite sermons. Titled \u201CPD\u2019s Favorite Sermons,\u201D the list was compiled by a YouTube account called \u201CAssistants PD\u201D and surfaced during Jane Doe\u2019s testimony. Another revelation came from one of the civil sex trafficking lawsuits against Combs, which describes his chief of staff, Kristina Khorram, as \u201Cthe Ghislaine Maxwell to Combs\u2019 Jeffrey Epstein.\u201D Prosecutors allege Combs forced Cassie Ventura to take part in so-called \u201Cfreak-offs,\u201D while the defense claims she participated voluntarily. Jurors again watched footage of Combs\u2019 drug-fueled sex parties, with the defense showing longer clips than the prosecution.

      "description": "Jurors in Sean \u0022Diddy\u0022 Combs sex trafficking trial were shown three \u0022freak off\u0022 sex tapes given to the state by Cassie Ventura. Combs mother, sister, and three sons were in the courtroom listening to his ex talk about these orgies. Jurors cringed and some turned their heads. The galley was unable to view the video. Jurors watched on small monitors with headphones. In other testimony, a paralegal specialist with the US Attorney\u0027s Office for the Southern District of New York, Ananya Sankar, said she reviewed the accuracy of the government charts that summarize exhibits. The charts show the jury text messages and other information that haven\u0027t been discussed in testimony, but were submitted into evidence. Among the evidence, texts between Combs staff planning \u0022hotel nights,\u0022 Diddy and Cassie, with Khorram and other staff discussing getting $4,000 cash to the hotel. Khorram tells assistant, Dave Shirley, \u201CHeads up, he\u2019s probably about to do wild king tonight.\u201D Shirley responds, \u0022...need to reup on baby oil\u0022. The jury also sees a text from Khorram to Cassie, \u0022Hi, Dave is at your door with the green\u0022. Prosecutors say they expect to rest their case as early as tomorrow, Wednesday.

      "description": "A major shakeup hits the Sean Combs trial after the judge dismisses a Black male juror. Judge Arun Subramanian says concerns emerged about the juror\u2019s candor after he allegedly gave conflicting statements about his residence. Combs\u2019 defense team vigorously objects to the removal of \u201CJuror 6,\u201D arguing it reduces the panel\u2019s diversity. The dismissed juror is replaced by a 57-year-old alternate\u2014a white accountant from Westchester. Paralegal specialist Ananya Sankar completes cross-examination as jurors review text messages between Sean \u201CDiddy\u201D Combs and his staff about purchasing drugs. In one thread, Combs\u2019 head of security, Faheem Muhammad, receives approval to buy thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of narcotics. Other messages between Chief of Staff Kristina Khorram and Muhammad show Combs once requested 15 MDMA pills, also known as molly or ecstasy.

A recap of powerful and emotional testimony against the disgraced rapper comes from ex-girlfriend \u0022Jane\u0022 testifying under a pseudonym.

We were compelled to do that.\u0022 Combs ex-girlfriend identified by pseudonym \u0022Jane\u0022 returns for her sixth day on the stand. Combs\u0027 defense has attacked Jane \u201Cup and down\u201D trying to show she agreed to sex acts, by using Combs messages as alleged proof, according to prosecutors.

      "description": "\u0022Jane\u0027s\u0022 testimony continues. She testifies she grew more defiant of Combs\u2019 \u201Chotel nights\u201D when he bragged about his sex life with another woman on a podcast.\n Jane sends several blunt texts the next time Combs asks for a \u201Chotel night\u201D while he\u2019s with another woman. \u201CI don\u2019t want to be used and locked in a room to perform and fulfill your fantasies. I\u2019m not a porn star. I\u2019m not an animal. Coming to the realization of what this really is.\u201D When Combs replies she\u2019s the only one who can bring him peace, Jane snaps back, \u201CIntroduce her to \u2018P.\u2019\u201D \u201D It\u0027s not me; it\u0027s the entertainment that puts you at peace.\u201D\n Jane says her text about \u2018P\u2019 referred to one of their \u201Centertainers,\u201D Paul.\n After their fight about \u201Chotel nights,\u201D Combs promises Jane they can have a weekend in New York, just the two of them. Jane believes Combs and gets on a plane, but not long after takeoff, Combs sends Jane a text about a \u201Csurprise.\u201D When she arrived, an \u201Centertainer\u201D was waiting in their hotel room.\n Combs brushed off Jane\u2019s clear disappointment and anger in the lounge of their hotel, and Jane says she felt so defeated, she agreed to go upstairs with Combs. Just a few days later, Combs decided that night needed a part two and had the New York entertainer meet the couple in Miami.\u00A0\n Jane testifies that the two-part \u201Chotel night\u201D went poorly because of her disappointment and distrust for the \u201Centertainer\u201D Combs chose, so she arranged another hotel night with a man she was more familiar with to \u201Cmake it up\u201D to Combs.\n Jane expresses in later texts to Combs that she had a hand in setting up \u201Chotel nights\u201D and hiring sex workers solely for her own safety against blackmail, pregnancy, and STDs, not because she wanted to participate.\n Jane reads more text messages she sent to Combs the next time he asked to see her for what she assumed would be another hotel night: \u201CSpend the day with your family or Gina; I need time to myself.\u201D\n In response, Combs promised that he wasn\u2019t seeking sex at all and only wanted to spend time with her.\n Jane stood her ground, writing, \u201CYou beat the love out of us. You made it crystal clear exactly what you want me for. You\u2019re going to spend the day love-bombing me so you can get what you want? It\u2019s not genuine. I\u2019ve hit a mental and spiritual wall.\u201D\n \u201CJane\u201D testifies she read Cassie\u2019s lawsuit the second she learned of it\u2014and fainted from shock. Jane says she was reading her own story, about her own sexual trauma, and felt even more betrayed by Combs\u2019 constantly dismissing her reluctance to participate in \u201Chotel nights.\u201D\n Jane immediately confronted Combs about Cassie\u2019s allegations in scathing texts.\n \u201CThe sick part is you knew this was coming, and you gaslit me and made me feel crazy about the sex trauma I was developing, knowing you\u2019ve been here before. It\u2019s all so clear that this was sexual exploitation that you framed as love for your sick fetishes.\u0022\u00A0\n Joining Nancy Grace today: \u00A0\n  Greg Morse - Criminal Defense Attorney of Morse Legal, Author of \u201CThe Untested\u201D [found on Amazon] Dr.\u202FBethany\u202FMarshall -\u00A0 Psychoanalyst, Author: \u0022Deal Breaker,\u0022 and featured in hit show \u0022Paris in Love\u0022 on Peacock; Instagram \u0026 TikTok: drbethanymarshall, X: @DrBethanyLive Chris McDonough -\u00A0 Director At the Cold Case Foundation, Former Homicide Detective [worked over 300 homicides in 25-year career], Trained the first Native American Homicide Task Force; Host of YouTube channel, \u0022The Interview Room\u0022 Dani Pinter - Senior Vice President and Director of Law Center, National Center on Sexual Exploitation Tisa Tells - Pop Culture Investigator \u0026 Commentator and Host of \u0027Tisa Tells\u0027 on YouTube; YouTube: @TisaTells, Instagram \u0026 TikTok: @TisaTellss See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",

      "description": "Sean Combs arranged \u201Chotel nights\u201D in New York, Los Angeles, Miami, and Turks and Caicos, according to testimony from a witness identified as \u201CJane.\u201D She told jurors she relied on Combs\u2019 chief of staff, Kristina Khorram, to arrange travel, while Combs\u2019 assistants prepared the hotel rooms with protective coverings, mood lighting, candles, lubricant, and large quantities of baby oil. She said Combs was obsessed with baby oil and claimed they used up to two dozen bottles during a single \u201Chotel night.\u201D\n Jane testified she met Combs during a girls\u2019 trip to Miami hosted by a friend. Two months later, she planned to return to Miami when Combs offered to pay for her hotel room in exchange for a date.\n In the months that followed, she described a whirlwind of lavish dates and trips. She said Combs frequently offered her ketamine and ecstasy. After a 15-day trip, she said Combs gave her $10,000, saying it was compensation for keeping her away from work. That financial support soon became routine, with Combs eventually taking over her rent payments.\n Jane said that four months into the relationship, Combs asked her to fantasize about another man. In the moment, she agreed. She testified that Combs immediately made calls to arrange a session and, within hours, they were in a hotel suite set up by his assistants. The room was prepared with lighting and protective coverings, she said, and they met \u201CDon,\u201D a man from Cowboys for Angels.\n Believing she was fulfilling a one-time fantasy for her boyfriend, Jane agreed to have sex with Don. But she compared her consent to opening a \u201CPandora\u2019s box\u201D she could no longer close.\n Every meeting that followed involved sex with another man, she said. Although she protested, both verbally and in writing, Combs allegedly threatened to break up with her and cut off financial support if she refused.\n Jurors were reportedly shocked by Jane\u2019s testimony describing what occurred during these \u201Chotel nights.\u201D\n \u00A0 Joining Nancy Grace today:\n  Troy Slaten - Los Angeles Criminal Defense Attorney, Slaten Lawyers, APC; X @TroySlaten Dr.\u202FBethany\u202FMarshall\u00A0-\u00A0 Psychoanalyst, Author: \u0022Deal Breaker,\u0022 and featured in hit show \u0022Paris in Love\u0022 on Peacock; Instagram \u0026 TikTok: drbethanymarshall, X: @DrBethanyLive Tisa Tells - Pop Culture Investigator \u0026 Commentator and Host of \u0027Tisa Tells\u0027 on YouTube; YouTube: @TisaTells, Instagram \u0026 TikTok: @TisaTellss Lynn Shaw -\u00A0 Founder and Executive Director of Lynn\u0027s Warriors, \u202FHost of Lynn\u0027s Warriors on YouTube; \u202FX: @lynns_warriors, YouTube: @LynnsWarriors Rob Shuter - Host: Naughty But Nice Podcast, Former Publicist of Sean Combs, and Author: \u0022The 4 Word Answer;\u0022IG: @naughtygossip Sydney\u202FSumner - Crime Stories \u202FInvestigative\u202FReporter See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",

The judge warned that any further attempts to influence jurors could lead to Combs being ejected.\n Combs\u2019 ex-girlfriend, testifying under the pseudonym \u201CJane,\u201D broke down on the stand as she described drug-fueled sex marathons.

Eddy Garcia, former Intercontinental Hotel Security Guard, briefly took the stand and immediately pled the fifth. Judge Subramanian agreed to grant him immunity for his testimony, as long as he speaks the truth on the stand. The former security officer tells the court Combs paid $100,000 for a copy of the video, which shows Comb\u0027s kicking and dragging Cassie. CNN last year published the security footage. Another witness introduced in opening statements expected to testify this week. \u201CJane,\u201D who alleges Combs drugged and coerced her into participating in Freak Offs by taking control of her finances. Many speculating if Combs\u2019 Chief of Staff, Kristina Khorram will testify, and if she does\u2014for which side.

      "description": "Another victim in Sean \u0022Diddy\u0022 Combs\u0027 sex trafficking trial referred to by a pseudonym, \u201CMia,\u201D former personal assistant to Sean \u201CDiddy\u201D Combs\u2019 and an executive at his film studio, Revolt TV, testifies Combs allegedly sexually assaulted her on multiple occasions.\n Mia states he could become violent, once slamming her into a wall and, on another occasion, throwing her into a pool. She once worked five days straight without sleep and used the drug Adderall to stay awake. \u0022Mia\u0022 was not allowed to lock her bedroom door when staying at Combs\u0027 and could not leave his sight.\n She recalls a confrontation in 2012 when she and Cassie Ventura were barricaded in a beachside room, hiding from an enraged Combs during a vacation in Turks and Caicos, they push furniture against the door to block Combs from entering.\u00A0\n \u00A0\u0022I was looking at Cass and she was screaming for help and, \u0027You have to help me, Puff is going to kill me,\u0027\u0022 \u0022Mia\u0022 recalls. \u0022She is usually chill and calm, and she was terrified.\u0022\n \u0022Mia and Cassie dash out a back door to the beach and out to a paddle board, fleeing into the water, however weather shifted drastically, sky turned black. We were both debating. I was trying to weigh if it was scarier to face Mother Nature or go back to Puff. We eventually went back to Puff.\u0022\n In cross-examination, defense Brian Steel questions Mia on her social media posts with Combs and on her communications with him in which she said, \u201Clove you\u201D and praised him as a \u201Cmentor and inspiration She said there were exciting times in the job and the \u201Chighs were really high, and the lows were really low.\u201D\n Follow Crime Stories with Nancy Grace for the latest in Sean \u0022Diddy\u0022 Combs\u0027 sex trafficking trial.\u00A0\n Joining Nancy Grace today:\n   Troy Slaten - Los Angeles Criminal Defense Attorney, Slaten Lawyers, APC; X @TroySlaten\u00A0\n   Dr.\u202FBethany\u202FMarshall-\u00A0 Psychoanalyst, Author: \u0022Deal Breaker,\u0022 and featured in hit show \u0022Paris in Love\u0022 on Peacock; Instagram \u0026 TikTok: drbethanymarshall, X: @DrBethanyLive\n   Brian Fitzgibbons -\u202FDirector of Operations for USPA Nationwide Security, Leads a team of investigators specializing in locating missing persons;\u00A0Instagram: @uspa_nationwide_security, former Marine and Iraq war veteran\n   Irv Brandt - Former Senior Inspector, US Marshals Service International Investigations Branch, Chief Inspector, DOJ Office of International Affairs; Country Attache, US Embassy Kingston, Jamaica.

      "description": "Kouri Richins\u0027 defense alleges that the Summit County Sheriff\u2019s Office illegally obtained evidence while investigating the death of Eric Richins. Defense attorneys Kathy Nester and Wendy Lewis say detectives violated Richins\u0027 constitutional rights and argue that the evidence should be ruled inadmissible during her murder trial. At the center of the motion are the \u0022Walk the Dog\u0022 letter and data from her phone and Apple accounts. Defense attorneys argue that investigators took Kouri\u2019s phone without a proper warrant and failed to inform her of her right to remain silent, her right to request a lawyer, and her right to refuse questioning. The case began when Eric Richins became violently ill on multiple occasions after having dinner with his wife, Kouri. The couple, who owned a successful real estate business, was celebrating a big sale when Kouri Richins prepared a drink for her husband. She then went to care for their children. Hours later, when she went to bed, Eric Richins was dead. Investigators believe his wife killed him by putting a fatal dose of fentanyl in his drink. Police also discovered that Kouri Richins attempted to change the beneficiary of her husband\u0027s life insurance policy.

      "description": "The full autopsy reports on Veronica Butler and Jillian Kelley have been released. Both reports identify the cause of death as multiple sharp force trauma. The reports list a total of 30 wounds on each victim, including 9 stab wounds and 21 cuts. Many of Butler\u0027s wounds were consistent with defensive injuries. A police affidavit states that Tifany Adams allegedly made statements implicating herself in the deaths of Butler and Kelley. Investigators believe Butler and Kelley were lured to the location, arriving around 9:40 a.m. Officers found pools of blood, Butler\u2019s glasses on the ground, and a broken hammer at the scene. Police believe the women were then forced into another vehicle. The probable cause affidavit contains extensive details, but the women\u2019s causes of death were not initially disclosed. Their bodies were discovered in a cattle pasture leased by Tad Bert Cullum, the boyfriend of Tifany Adams. Cellphone data from three burner phones purchased by Adams helped narrow down the location. The phones first pinged near Butler\u0027s abandoned car, and the data later led police to the pasture. Officers found signs of digging. A hole, which had been refilled, contained the bodies of the two women. Investigators cite a custody battle over Butler\u2019s two children as the motive. The custody dispute had lasted more than five years. Butler\u2019s ex-partner, Wrangler Rickman, who is Adams\u2019 son, had custody of the children. However, Rickman was confirmed to be in a rehabilitation facility in Oklahoma City at the time. Butler was allowed supervised visitation with her children every Saturday. According to her attorney, she was likely to gain unsupervised visitation in an upcoming hearing. The affidavit states, \u201CAdams vehemently opposed this and went to great lengths to plan and purchase items used in Butler and Kelley\u2019s murders.\u201D It continues, \u201CAdams, Cullum, Cole, and Cora were willing to kidnap and murder two victims to limit visitation for Butler.\u201D Court documents also allege that Adams and her accomplices attempted to kill Butler in February. Adams, her boyfriend, and another couple reportedly drove to Butler\u2019s home near Hugoton, Kansas, intending to kill her. A witness told investigators the plan was to throw an anvil through Butler\u2019s windshield to make it appear as an accident, but Butler did not leave her home. State investigators retrieved data from Adams\u2019 phone showing searches for terms such as \u201Ctaser pain level,\u201D \u201Cgun shops,\u201D \u201Cprepaid cellular phones,\u201D and \u201Chow to get someone out of their house.\u201D According to the documents, Adams purchased five stun guns before the women disappeared. She also bought three prepaid burner phones from a nearby Walmart. All the burner phones stopped transmitting on the morning of the women\u2019s disappearance. After the attack, the bodies were reportedly stored in a sealed freezer before being buried 4 to 8 feet underground.

      "description": "Sean Combs is back in the Metropolitan Detention Center after U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter denied his appeal of the remand order. Magistrate Judge Robyn F. Tarnofsky initially denied bail for the rapper on Tuesday, stating that Combs posed a danger and quoting, \u0022I don\u2019t know that you can trust yourself not to harm people.\u0022 In the appeal for monitored house arrest, Combs\u0027 attorney described the conditions at the Brooklyn facility as \u0022horrific\u0022 and \u0022not fit for pre-trial detention.\u0022 The defense proposed that Combs live alone at his Florida home, monitored by a 24/7 security team. Combs offered to relinquish access to his cell phone and the internet. The defense also suggested travel restrictions, noting that Combs had already surrendered his passport to his attorneys months ago. His attorney also holds the passports of Combs\u0027 mother and dependent children. The proposed travel limits would confine Combs to the Southern District of New York and the Southern District of Florida, where he resides and has necessary medical appointments, details of which would be submitted under seal. Attorney Marc Agnifilo\u2019s amended bail package proposed no communication with women outside of direct family members and the mothers of his children, as well as no contact with known grand jury witnesses, specifically referencing \u0022Victim 1,\u0022 Cassandra Ventura. The proposal also included the use of a private intelligence agency to monitor Combs 24/7, ensure he has no access to a cell phone or the internet, administer weekly drug tests, and maintain a daily visitors log. In the end, Judge Andrew Carter, Jr. agreed with Judge Robyn Tarnofsky, stating that \u0022there is no condition or combination of conditions to ensure he will not obstruct justice or tamper with witnesses.\u0022 Sean Combs remains in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn until his trial.

      "description": "The second person charged in the deaths of Tylee Ryan, JJ Vallow, and Tammy Daybell is now in court. Chad Daybell, husband of Cult Mom Lori Vallow, is facing the same charges as his wife and more. Shortly after her husband Charles Vallow\u2019s shooting death, Lori Vallow moves with her two children to Rexburg, Idaho. It\u2019s not far from where Chad Daybell, Vallow\u2019s lover and \u201Chusband from a past life\u201D resides with his wife Tammy Daybell. Tylee Ryan and J.J. Vallow settle in, making a trip to Yellowstone National Park with their mom and uncle Alex Cox. A photo from that trip is the last proof of Tylee\u2019s life, and weeks later, J.J. Vallow stops going to school. Meanwhile, Vallow and Daybell spend more time together. The couple is seen loading a storage unit with Vallow\u2019s children\u2019s belongings. A month passes, and suddenly Daybell\u2019s wife Tammy is dead. Two weeks later, Lori Vallow is now Lori Vallow-Daybell after a wedding ceremony on a Kauai beach. Chad Daybell\u2019s wife Tammy Daybell dies in her sleep at the age of 49. Friends were shocked by her death, saying that Tammy was incredibly fit. The mom of five was training for a marathon and regularly attended high-intensity exercise classes with friends. However, Chad Daybell painted a very different story of his wife\u2019s health. He said Tammy Daybell was sickly, always coughing, and struggling with low blood pressure that led to fainting spells. Daybell said on the night of her death, Tammy Daybell had a coughing fit that led her to vomit. He helped her to bed and was startled awake when Tammy rolled onto the floor. Daybell says when he checked on her, he realized Tammy was dead. Fremont County Coroner, Brenda Dye, took Daybell\u2019s account of his wife\u2019s health into consideration when she ruled Tammy Daybell\u2019s cause of death to be pulmonary edema due to a cardiac event without performing an autopsy. By June of 2020, detectives are narrowing down what happened to J.J. Vallow and Tylee Ryan since their disappearance nearly six months earlier. Lori Vallow-Daybell is behind bars on two felony charges of Desertion \u0026 Nonsupport of Dependent Children after failing to produce Tylee and J.J. in court on January 30. On April 9, police announce their suspicion that Vallow and Vallow-Daybell conspired to kill Tammy Daybell. Rexburg Police return to Chad Daybell\u2019s home for another search. While Daybell is detained, investigators uncover human remains in a pet cemetery in Daybell\u2019s backyard. The remains are later confirmed to be J.J. Vallow and Tylee Ryan.

      "description": "The parents of a 12-year-old boy think Trails Carolina might be just the place to help their son. Trails Carolina claims to be a Leader in Wilderness Therapy offering an Adventure Wilderness Program for children who have behavioral and or emotional difficulties. The parents say their boy is transported by two men from New York to Trails Carolina Camp at Lake Toxaway, North Carolina. Their son arrives at the camp in an agitated state. The 12-year-old is loud and disruptive, but he is assigned to a cabin with other children as well as four adults. In less than 24 hours, the 12-year-old boy from New York is dead. Sheriff Chuck Owenby says an autopsy is being conducted because the death \u0022appeared suspicious\u0022 since the boy died at the camp less than 24 hours after he arrived. A counselor explained to investigators that the boy was required to sleep on the floor inside a sleeping bag. The sleeping bag is inside a small tent called a \u0022BIVY.\u0022 According to search warrant documents, around midnight the boy started to experience a panic attack. After the panic attack, a counselor told investigators that the boy was checked on throughout the night starting at 12 a.m., with additional checks on his well-being at 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. At 7:45 a.m., the boy was found dead. According to the search warrant, when investigators arrived at the scene, CJH was stiff and \u0022cold to the touch.\u0022 He was lying on his back, his arms were on his chest, and his \u0022knees bent upwards toward the sky.\u0022 Also in the search warrant, investigators noted spots of bleeding under the skin, \u0022possible petechiae\u0022 in the boy\u0027s lips and eyes. This is considered a sign of asphyxiation. The warrant also notes a CPR mask was covering the boy\u0027s face and he was not wearing any pants or underwear. His pants and underwear were lying next to his shoulder Early in the investigation, detectives with the Transylvania County Sheriff\u0027s Office attempted to interview other juveniles at Trails Carolina when the boy died. However, camp staff members refused to allow investigators to interview or even see any of the other juveniles. Trails Carolina says the search warrant contains \u0022misleading statements\u0022 saying they won\u0027t discuss some details \u0022out of respect for the family and the investigation.\u0022 In a statement, Trails Carolina says they did not prevent children from speaking to investigators claiming they asked parents for permission for any children involved to speak with law enforcement and state agencies, and \u0022complied with each parent\u0027s preference. as we are required to do.\u0022 Children were moved to the area to protect them from seeing what was happening, not to avoid investigators. In response to the recent suspicious death of a 12-year-old at Trails Carolina, North Carolina health officials ordered the removal of all children from the nature therapy program.
