      "description": "Scientology fraud\r\n\r\nReporter: Bryan Seymour\r\nBroadcast Date: May 29, 2009\r\n\r\nThe church of Scientology is fighting one of the biggest battles in its 50-year history.\r\n\r\nForget Xenu the alien overlord and Tom Cruise\u0027s bizarre outbursts, this time they\u0027re in court facing serious fraud charges.\r\n\r\nA woman in France alleges she was manipulated into handing over her life savings.\r\n\r\nBryan Seymour reports the case has ignited questions here about how Scientology minds its own business.\r\n\r\nScientology is under siege.\r\n\r\n\u0022Well in Germany Scientology isn\u0027t recognised as a religion and in France it\u0027s leaders are facing fraud charges,\u0022 said Nick Xenophon, the Independent Federal Senator from South Australia.\r\n\r\nIn Paris a court will decide if Scientology fraudulently manipulated a woman into handing over $36,000.\r\n\r\n\u0022The only purpose of Scientology is to take money from people,\u0022 said the French prosecutor in the case. He is seeking to have Scientology\u0027s leaders found guilty and fined over ten million dollars and to have the group banned from France altogether.\r\n\r\nThe French spokeswoman for Scientology was blunt in her assessment of the case: \u0022\u00E2?\u00A6it\u0027s nothing really, it\u0027s bullshit really.\u0022\r\n\r\nShe added that the judge may have been influenced \u0022by the media and the climate\u0022 to allow the trial to proceed, which is a serious and unfounded allegation.\r\n\r\nOriginally four people were accusing Scientology of fraud but two of them came to a financial settlement with the organisation.\r\n\r\nThe woman at the centre of the trial says she was walking past Scientology headquarters in Paris in 1998. She was approached in the street and offered a free personality test.\r\n\r\n\u0022She was humiliated and defrauded for a long time, she bought cases full of expensive books and cassettes all cloaked in this goal of self-improvement to become this incredible person,\u0022 said the French Prosecutor trying the case\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, the test revealed she had shortfalls. She says she was told Scientology had the cure and was then scammed into buying books, courses, vitamins and even an electrometer, which is supposedly able to measure mental energy.\r\n\r\nScientology says the case is one of religious discrimination rather than the alleged fraud leading to members handing over their life savings.\r\n\r\n\u0022There\u0027s no witch-hunt, France respects freedom but even with religious freedom France can\u0027t ignore people breaking the law, if you have religious freedom if you can\u0027t do things that are above the law,\u0022 said a French Government official.\r\n\r\nAfter a nine year inquiry into the group, a French judge declared Scientology \u0022...is first and foremost a commercial business.\u0022\r\n\r\nProsecutors allege the director of Scientology in France, Alain Rosenberg, and six other top officials preyed on vulnerable would-be followers \u0022...with the goal of seizing their fortune by exerting a psychological hold.\u0022\r\n\r\nToday Tonight were contacted by a woman who claimed she had been recruited into Scientology as a child and manipulated into handing over a vast sum of money. When Today Tonight approached Scientology to respond to her claims, they said the woman had signed a confidentiality contract with them and they sent their lawyers scurrying to court seeking an injunction on the story.\r\n\r\nBut that\u0027s not why Today Tonight decided not to show the interview. Her family asked that the the interview not be aired - and Today Tonight agree... her best interests should come first.\r\n\r\nFederal senator Nick Xenophon says it\u0027s time to re-examine Scientology\u0027s claims as a religion and to change the laws to force the group to start paying tax.\r\n\r\n\u0022We need to have a close look at those laws because I think there\u0027s a lot of community concern that an organisation such as Scientology gets the huge benefits of having the tax exempt status as a religion,\u0022 Senator Xenophon said.\r\n\r\nHistorically Scientology brands anyone who questions their organisation a religious bigot.\r\n\r\n\u0022This is not about religious bigotry, this is about accountability and I think it\u0027s pretty cowardly of an organisation to start accusing those that just want to question they way they operate, to make sure what they do is transparent, accountable and fair,\u0022 Senator Xenophon said.\r\n\r\nAs always, the church of Scientology declined a request to be interviewed.\r\n\r\nNo doubt they\u0027ll be closely watching what happens in France.\r\n\r\n\u0022I think there is a role for regulators, for governments to have a very close look at these tactics because if they don\u0027t we\u0027ll continue to see more and more of these cases emerging where people\u0027s lives are being destroyed because they\u0027ve handed over their life savings, they\u0027ve handed over their inheritances to Scientology,\u0022 Senator Xenophon said.\r\n\r\nThe cult information and family support network has branded Scientology a cult, not a religion and say ex-members can contact them for help and advice.",

The rest of the interview is even more puff about Cruise and Valkryie. Leil even has the gaul to say Valkryie is \u0022a hit movie\u0022. Well, if it is a \u0022hit movie\u0022, then why has it only earned $7mil over the $70Mil MGM poured out to convince people to watch it.

United States Department of Treasury, et al.\r\n\r\nRecords at the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) show Barbara Schwarz, a German citizen,[15] has made more requests under the FOIA than any other person since it became law in 1966.[15] For more than ten years Schwarz has made repeated requests with many federal departments and agencies for public records the government says don\u0027t exist. Schwarz believes, and her requests are aimed to prove, that rather than having been born in Germany her actual birth was around 1956 inside a secret government submarine base called Chattanooga under the Great Salt Lake. She further believes herself to be daughter of Church of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, himself the son of Dwight Eisenhower.[15][17] Further saying that she was then kidnapped, taken to Germany, and given a false identity including a German birth certificate which was doctored to conceal her actual birth in Utah.[15] Working from her Salt Lake City, Utah apartment or a nearby library at least one of Schwarz\u0027s lawsuits has been considered by a U.S. District or U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals somewhere in the nation every year since 1993 and has filed unsuccessful appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court.[15] One of her complaints to the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., set a record for voluminous litigation at 2,370 pages, naming 3,087 defendants, all of whom were employed as FOIA or \u0022Privacy Act\u0022 officers in the federal government claiming their denials to be part of a conspiracy to keep the truth from her. U.S. District Court Judge John Bates said the FOIA\u0027s \u0022admirable purpose is abused when misguided individuals are allowed (in this case repeatedly) to submit requests to every agency and subdivision of the government, seeking information about an imaginary conspiracy,\u0022 in a ruling against her.[15] Unencumbered by a lack of education in law or realistic requests, the foil to her quest is financial. She has mounted pro se litigation in the hopes of forcing these agencies to do more detailed searches and to waive the costs, claiming poverty, so far without success.[15] The Justice Department has advised federal employees charged with responding to FOIA requests that until Schwarz satisfies outstanding search and copying fees incurred by previous filings, future requests may legally be denied.\r\nhttp://home.snafu.de/tilman/Barbara_Schwarz_8.8.2006.html",

Most of L-11 for instance was developed from the case of a staff member who had become intensely and violently psychotic on the Apollo. (In C/S 22 LRH mentions that a CL XI has a \r\ndifferent approach to handle psychosis). After all throughout those materials, LRH boasts that he has the cure to insanity Unfortunately checking into the later track of all those pcs, one finds the bulk of them, far from being the Supermen they were made to attest to, were for the most part later declared SP, showed very aberrated behaviour and failed as execs. The original psychotic out of whom L-11 was derived was named Peggy McCall and her auditor was Liese Klingsvall. \r\nAccording to the case history she had been found to be raving hostile remarks against LRH and had been \u0022violent\u0022 (no specifics). LRH invented from the top of his head a process later known as C/S series 37R claiming she would be permanently cured of her insanity by it. After auditing that action and a few other steps (which is textually L-11 as given today) she was made to attest and offloaded. This shows that a powerful rundown claimed to cure insanity, was piloted on ONE person beside LRH doing it solo on himself before being labelled as \u0022full3,\u0027 researched and vindicated\u0022. The name of the pc on whom L-11 is based is Peggy McCall who went crazy and was locked up on the Apollo in 1971. \u0022  http://www.lermanet.com/cos/inside.html",

The program is completely biased and full of lies. \r\n\r\nGo to www.freedommag.org to watch the Church\u0027s documentary about the making of the BBC show. This gives the real story. \r\n\r\nPlease we need to have our voices heard. Put your story about Scientology and what you got out of it on http://au.todaytonight.com/contact \r\n\r\nAlso go to A Current Affair website and write down what you got out of Scientology as well. \r\n\r\nTell all of your friends. \r\n\r\nML, \r\nGina and Virginia",
