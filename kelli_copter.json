      "description": "This never-before-seen interview was filmed in November 2023. It is my last conversation with my friend Doug Kramer before he passed away less than a month later Initially, I wasn\u0027t sure if I would ever share this with you all because I couldn\u0027t bring myself to watch the interview until very recently. Doug had so much wisdom to share, even in this casual setting. \n\nI find myself feeling envious of the blissful ignorance we both had, not realising that this would be our final conversation. We discussed Hollywood and how Scientology recruits young actors who are trying to make it in the industry.\n@dbnc \n\n\nJoin this channel to get access to the perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6q1t92tB_nPPWkW76Gzeww/join\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/kellicopter",

I thought this needed it\u2019s own moment. Many people take the test, for a joke, for fun or because they are seeking help. By all means if you want to do it. Go ahead but I thought it would be in the interest of the public to see an example of the results you might get. \n\nThe aim of these tests are to get you to pay for books, courses and even DVD\u2019s.
