      "description": "In 1914, a man who came to be known as Father Divine rolled into Valdosta, Georgia claiming to be God, and his growing group of loyal female followers believed him. What followed was one of the most bizarre trials in American history: a scandalous courtroom showdown that put \u201CGod\u201D on trial\n\nThis episode of Hot Mess History dives into the rise of a Black cult leader in the Jim Crow South, the chaos his teachings sparked, and the lunacy trial that tried to bring him down. Was he a prophet, a fraud, or something else entirely? \n\n#FatherDivine #cultleaders",
