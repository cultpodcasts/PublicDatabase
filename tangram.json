      "description": "Chicago cameraman and indie filmmaker Allen Ross made seven films with German filmmaker Christian Bauer. Then he vanished without a trace. Four years after his disappearance, angered by the apathy of the police, Bauer returns to America to find out what happened to his friend. His investigations take him on an increasingly disturbing trail from Chicago\u2019s art scene to satanic sects in Waco and Oklahoma City.",
