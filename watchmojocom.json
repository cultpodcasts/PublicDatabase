      "description": "On November 18th, 1978, a shocking tragedy unfolded in the jungles of Guyana. Join us as we examine the disturbing rise of Jim Jones, the creation of Jonestown, and the horrifying mass murder-suicide that claimed over 900 lives. How did one man manipulate so many into following him to their deaths? And what lessons can we learn from one of history\u0027s darkest chapters? We trace Jones\u0027 journey from his troubled childhood in Indiana through his creation of the Peoples Temple, his exploitation of vulnerable followers, and the fateful visit by Congressman Leo Ryan that triggered the final \u0022White Night\u0022 - leaving 304 children among the dead in what would remain the largest loss of American civilian life until September 11th, 2001.\n\nBecome a channel member to get access to special perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaWd5_7JhbQBe4dknZhsHJg/join\n\nPlay our Daily Point Battles to earn MojoPoints and qualify for CASH BATTLES!
