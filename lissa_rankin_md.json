      "description": "Cults don\u2019t exploit your flaws\u2014they exploit your goodness. In this compassionate talk, Lissa Rankin, Anke Richter, and Jeffrey Rediger explore why nobody is immune to cultic dynamics. Resources: https://lissarankin.com\n\nThink you\u2019re too smart, too skeptical, too self-aware to fall for a cult?\nThink again.\n\nIn this honest and eye-opening conversation, Dr. Lissa Rankin (Mind Over Medicine), psychiatrist Dr. Jeffrey Rediger (Cured), and journalist Anke Richter (Cult Trip) explore how cults prey not on our weaknesses\u2014but on our strengths.\n\n\uD83C\uDF1F Cults don\u2019t just target the lost or naive.
