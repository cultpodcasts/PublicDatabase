The intensity of these attractions vary dramatically\u2026ranging from unsettling to panic attack inducing. And at the heart of these haunts are the scare actors. Each night they get into costume and completely immerse themselves into their creepy characters, to give customers a night they\u2019ll never forget. But what if I told you that the true monsters were actually the people behind the costumes. Today we\u2019re talking about scare actors who hid their dark secrets behind a mask and used the haunted attractions as their hunting grounds. \n\nSources:\nhttps://patch.com/california/lakeelsinore-wildomar/sex-ring-investigation-reveals-field-screams-haunted-house-ties\nhttps://patch.com/california/lakeelsinore-wildomar/victims-speak-out-sex-cult-leader-lake-elsinore \nhttps://jimspubiversidesheriff.org/cgi-bin/iisinfo.acu?bkno=201928930G\nhttps://patch.com/california/temecula/southwest-rivco-man-accused-raping-teen-girls\nhttps://mynewsla.com/crime/2022/07/21/serial-sexual-assailant-sentenced-in-murrieta/#google_vignette\nhttps://www.insideedition.com/are-sex-offenders-working-in-haunted-house-attractions-across-the-us-77690\nhttps://myrcns.com/2019/08/06/elsinore-man-officials-say-engaged-in-sex-with-3-teens-arrested/\nhttps://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/lake-elsinore-sex-dungeon-sentenced-200-year-fowler-teens/2948530/\nhttps://www.hauntweekly.com/1991532/episodes/10865296-haunt-weekly-episode-343-sexual-assault-and-haunting \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h2gHENV9PE \nhttps://247headline.com/lake-elsinore-man-arrested-for-having-illegal-sexual-relationships-with-teen-girls/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hThwMjssdzk \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZSdQTqVxxQ \nhttps://scaryvisions.com/the-bloodshed-brothers/\n\nSend me case suggestions here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSet80e93doLMMSXMx0JMm9PGlOYMM9E7vYE833pFj2kpaA0UQ/viewform\n\nMy Equipment:\nMic https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BMFQP2ZZ?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details\u0026th=1\nTripod https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085C44B1L/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8\u0026psc=1\nLens https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YM2NZ9X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8\u0026psc=1\nCamera https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Mirrorless-Digital-Camera-15-45mm/dp/B08YCCZFZB/ref=sr_1_4?crid=3IOFY6I7GDQOT\u0026keywords=canon\u002Beos\u002Bm50\u002Bmark\u002Bii\u0026qid=1704516707\u0026s=electronics\u0026sprefix=canon\u002Beos\u002Bma%2Celectronics%2C146\u0026sr=1-4\n\nMy Background Decor:\nWall Lights https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09MPXW9VD?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details\u0026th=1\nShelves https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8SZZXGQ?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details\u0026th=1\nThe Silmarillion Illustrated https://www.amazon.com/Silmarillion-Illustrated-J-R-R-Tolkien/dp/0063280779/ref=sr_1_4?crid=3TMCZ6R8HCSW7\u0026keywords=the\u002Bsilmarillion\u0026qid=1704517113\u0026s=books\u0026sprefix=The\u002Bsil%2Cstripbooks%2C155\u0026sr=1-4\nMonstera https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09CM7JMN1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8\u0026psc=1\nGold Round Frame (similar to mine) https://www.amazon.com/Laura-Ashley-Picture-Tabletop-Display/dp/B0BK2TST71/ref=sr_1_40?crid=15FRMOUUW12FB\u0026keywords=gold\u002Btabletop\u002Bframe\u002Bsun\u0026qid=1704517254\u0026s=home-garden\u0026sprefix=gold\u002Btabletop\u002Bframe\u002Bsun%2Cgarden%2C128\u0026sr=1-40\nCalcifer https://www.etsy.com/listing/1043015513/calcifer-howls-moving-castle?ref=yr_purchases\nJiji https://www.etsy.com/listing/1181985573/jiji-kikis-delivery-service?click_key=4a0a743d76b29680235b83144f8b7022254efb62%3A1181985573\u0026click_sum=6c411231\u0026ref=related-2\u0026sts=1\nKoroks https://www.etsy.com/listing/1564196987/family-set-wooden-korok-zelda-tears-of?click_key=a6759c58f16464b85f2d9f20c4afcd9a9bfc3ec9%3A1564196987\u0026click_sum=1d4dcd6a\u0026ref=related-1\u0026pro=1\nLink \u0026 Zelda https://www.instagram.com/crying_carries_creations/\nWall Paint Color: Sherwin Williams 2939 Blue Hill \n\nCheck out my merch shop: https://shop.sommersanchez.com\nFollow Me on Instagram! https://www.instagram.com/sommer_sanchezyt/",

As the little girl played with her friends, she suddenly blurted out something very disturbing. She told her friends that her 12 year old sister is  pregnant but they didn\u2019t know which of her brothers was the baby\u2019s father. This comment made its way to the local authorities and an investigation was immediately launched. But the police were not prepared for what they were about to discover. This was not an isolated case of abuse between a brother and a sister\u2026they had actually uncovered the worst case of incest that Australia had ever seen. This family had been involved in cult-like incestuous practices dating back 5 generations. \n\nSources: \nhttps://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/revealed-for-the-first-time-colt-family-photo-album-offers-glimpse-of-life-inside-australias-incest-clan/news-story/9cf33841b0f1652dc3ee616d49f7040b\nhttps://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/new-zealand-origin-incest-colt-clan-new-details-emerge-of-depraved-patriarch/QEFKZYQRVXEMGZT4JH75WG3CWM/\nhttps://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/dad-centre-incest-investigation-arrested-4635629?_ga=2.8100533.601352470.1721607230-1818338635.1721607231\nhttps://www.news.com.au/national/incest-clan-the-colts-declare-family-love-on-facebook/news-story/2c697196410efb0e7a13000268beecee\nhttps://www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au/decision/54a63b193004de94513db1b2\nhttps://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/betty-colt-case-mother-of-abused-children-jailed-for-trying-to-kidnap-them-from-foster-care-20141103-11g30k.html\nhttps://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/new-zealand-origin-incest-colt-clan-new-details-emerge-of-depraved-patriarch/QEFKZYQRVXEMGZT4JH75WG3CWM/#google_vignette\n\nSend me case suggestions here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSet80e93doLMMSXMx0JMm9PGlOYMM9E7vYE833pFj2kpaA0UQ/viewform\n\nMy Equipment:\nMic https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BMFQP2ZZ?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details\u0026th=1\nTripod https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085C44B1L/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8\u0026psc=1\nLens https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YM2NZ9X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8\u0026psc=1\nCamera https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Mirrorless-Digital-Camera-15-45mm/dp/B08YCCZFZB/ref=sr_1_4?crid=3IOFY6I7GDQOT\u0026keywords=canon\u002Beos\u002Bm50\u002Bmark\u002Bii\u0026qid=1704516707\u0026s=electronics\u0026sprefix=canon\u002Beos\u002Bma%2Celectronics%2C146\u0026sr=1-4\n\nMy Background Decor:\nWall Lights https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09MPXW9VD?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details\u0026th=1\nShelves https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8SZZXGQ?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details\u0026th=1\nThe Silmarillion Illustrated https://www.amazon.com/Silmarillion-Illustrated-J-R-R-Tolkien/dp/0063280779/ref=sr_1_4?crid=3TMCZ6R8HCSW7\u0026keywords=the\u002Bsilmarillion\u0026qid=1704517113\u0026s=books\u0026sprefix=The\u002Bsil%2Cstripbooks%2C155\u0026sr=1-4\nMonstera https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09CM7JMN1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8\u0026psc=1\nGold Round Frame (similar to mine) https://www.amazon.com/Laura-Ashley-Picture-Tabletop-Display/dp/B0BK2TST71/ref=sr_1_40?crid=15FRMOUUW12FB\u0026keywords=gold\u002Btabletop\u002Bframe\u002Bsun\u0026qid=1704517254\u0026s=home-garden\u0026sprefix=gold\u002Btabletop\u002Bframe\u002Bsun%2Cgarden%2C128\u0026sr=1-40\nCalcifer https://www.etsy.com/listing/1043015513/calcifer-howls-moving-castle?ref=yr_purchases\nJiji https://www.etsy.com/listing/1181985573/jiji-kikis-delivery-service?click_key=4a0a743d76b29680235b83144f8b7022254efb62%3A1181985573\u0026click_sum=6c411231\u0026ref=related-2\u0026sts=1\nKoroks https://www.etsy.com/listing/1564196987/family-set-wooden-korok-zelda-tears-of?click_key=a6759c58f16464b85f2d9f20c4afcd9a9bfc3ec9%3A1564196987\u0026click_sum=1d4dcd6a\u0026ref=related-1\u0026pro=1\nLink \u0026 Zelda https://www.instagram.com/crying_carries_creations/\nWall Paint Color: Sherwin Williams 2939 Blue Hill \n\nFollow Me on Instagram! https://www.instagram.com/sommer_sanchezyt/",

      "description": "\uD83D\uDC52 \uD83D\uDD0EDownload June\u2019s Journey for free now using my link: https://woo.ga/e9q2grug\n\nIn November of 2007, 35 members of an extremist religious group in Russia\u2019s Penza region, gathered up supplies and made their way down into a cave. They had been sent into the cave on the orders of their leader, a 43 year old man named Pyotr Kuznetsov. Pyotr told his followers that they were God\u2019s chosen ones and in order to survive the coming apocalypse, they were to remain inside the cave. Among their supplies were several cans of gasoline and the cult members warned authorities that they would set themselves on fire if anyone attempted to remove them from the cave. So, Russian authorities and local priests camped out near the cave for months, helplessly watching and waiting for the members to come out. And for 6 months, the world watched in disbelief as the cult members endured freezing temperatures, floods, structural collapses of the cave and starvation\u2026and even then some remained.

By a massive explosive fire. The church belonging to a fanatical religious group had erupted in flames and the fire was absolutely devastating. More than 300 members of The Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God had died in the fire. The bodies inside the church were totally unrecognizable, many of the people were never identified and the actual number of deaths is unknown because some of the bodies had melted together. This was a huge blow to the community\u2026but the nightmare didn\u2019t end there. Over the next couple of weeks, hundreds of more bodies would be discovered in different areas of the country. These people had also been members of The Movement of the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God, and there was no doubt that these people had been brutally murdered. And soon, the country of Uganda would find itself in the middle of the biggest murder investigation it had ever seen. \n\nSources:\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/27/world/fateful-meeting-led-to-founding-of-cult-in-uganda.html\nhttps://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/movement-restoration-ten-commandments-god\nhttps://newreligiousmovements.org/m/movement-for-the-restoration-of-the-ten-commandments-of-god/\nhttp://www.histarch.illinois.edu/harper/millenial8.html\nhttps://www.academia.edu/685061/The_Movement_for_the_Restoration_of_the_Ten_Commandments_of_God\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/45681143_Doomsday_movements_in_Africa_Restoration_of_the_Ten_Commandments_of_God\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/apr/07/5\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/694729.stm\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrxQYbk2LBI\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlxkbtYC6O4\u0026t=255s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XtWRhNp7TY\n\nMy Equipment:\nMic https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BMFQP2ZZ?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details\u0026th=1\nTripod https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085C44B1L/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8\u0026psc=1\nLens https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YM2NZ9X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8\u0026psc=1\nCamera https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Mirrorless-Digital-Camera-15-45mm/dp/B08YCCZFZB/ref=sr_1_4?crid=3IOFY6I7GDQOT\u0026keywords=canon\u002Beos\u002Bm50\u002Bmark\u002Bii\u0026qid=1704516707\u0026s=electronics\u0026sprefix=canon\u002Beos\u002Bma%2Celectronics%2C146\u0026sr=1-4\n\nMy Background Decor:\nWall Lights https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09MPXW9VD?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details\u0026th=1\nShelves https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8SZZXGQ?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details\u0026th=1\nThe Silmarillion Illustrated https://www.amazon.com/Silmarillion-Illustrated-J-R-R-Tolkien/dp/0063280779/ref=sr_1_4?crid=3TMCZ6R8HCSW7\u0026keywords=the\u002Bsilmarillion\u0026qid=1704517113\u0026s=books\u0026sprefix=The\u002Bsil%2Cstripbooks%2C155\u0026sr=1-4\nMonstera https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09CM7JMN1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8\u0026psc=1\nGold Round Frame (similar to mine) https://www.amazon.com/Laura-Ashley-Picture-Tabletop-Display/dp/B0BK2TST71/ref=sr_1_40?crid=15FRMOUUW12FB\u0026keywords=gold\u002Btabletop\u002Bframe\u002Bsun\u0026qid=1704517254\u0026s=home-garden\u0026sprefix=gold\u002Btabletop\u002Bframe\u002Bsun%2Cgarden%2C128\u0026sr=1-40\nCalcifer https://www.etsy.com/listing/1043015513/calcifer-howls-moving-castle?ref=yr_purchases\nJiji https://www.etsy.com/listing/1181985573/jiji-kikis-delivery-service?click_key=4a0a743d76b29680235b83144f8b7022254efb62%3A1181985573\u0026click_sum=6c411231\u0026ref=related-2\u0026sts=1\nKoroks https://www.etsy.com/listing/1564196987/family-set-wooden-korok-zelda-tears-of?click_key=a6759c58f16464b85f2d9f20c4afcd9a9bfc3ec9%3A1564196987\u0026click_sum=1d4dcd6a\u0026ref=related-1\u0026pro=1\nWall Paint Color: Sherwin Williams 2939 Blue Hill \n\nFollow Me on Instagram! https://www.instagram.com/sommer_sanchezyt/",

He created his own off shoot of the SDA church and soon amassed a following of 300 ex-SDA members. At first, life seemed quaint and simple in this new church, but before long, Wayne started showing his darker side. He claimed the Archangel Michael had appeared to him and given him a message\u2026he was the Messiah. He changed his name to Michael Travesser and brainwashed his followers into blindly trusting every single thing he said. And before long, this little known cult would make national news. \u201CMichael\u201D wasn\u2019t the Messiah.

And tragically, Jeffrey managed to brainwash his followers into sacrificing five of their own members. \n\nCHAPTERS\n0:00 Intro\n1:37 RLDS History\n2:53 Alice Lundgren\n8:33 Jeffrey Lundgren\n10:37 Relationship/Beliefs\n34:05 Cult Beginnings \n1:05:15 The Beginning of the End\n\nSources:\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1986/08/a-choice-seer?lang=eng\n\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/43200280\n\nhttps://speeches.byu.edu/talks/neal-a-maxwell/joseph-smith-choice-seer/\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Prophet-Death-Mormon-Blood-Atonement-Killings/dp/068810584X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=UUZNFALWUU5R\u0026keywords=prophet\u002Bof\u002Bdeath\u0026qid=1668957659\u0026sprefix=prophet\u002Bof\u002Bdeath%2Caps%2C117\u0026sr=8-1\n\nhttps://www.dailymotion.com/video/x72osqm\n\nhttps://www.oxygen.com/deadly-cults/crime-time/how-jeffrey-lundgren-and-the-kirtland-cult-executed-a-family-in-their-own\n\nhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt4745916/\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/clip/112948636/\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/clip/112948526/\n\nhttps://www.kirtlandtemple.org/history\n\nhttps://thechurchofjesuschrist.org/the-choice-seer-2-nephi-3/",

      "description": "In the 1980\u0027s, a small religious/survivalist cult was secretly living on a defunct 80 acre pig farm in Rulo, Nebraska. The cult leader was a disgusting, sadistic man named Michael Ryan. And through manipulation, physical and mental abuse and the Arm Test, (a test used by this cult as a way to speak to God) Michael Ryan would convince his followers to commit terrible crimes. And in the end, two innocent people would lose their lives.\n\nMichael Ryan became a member of the Posse Comitatus and an avid follower of James Wickstrom\u0027s (the Posse leader) in the early 1980\u0027s, and quickly became obsessed with the religious aspects of Wickstrom\u0027s teachings. This obsession led Mike to start his own cult and ultimately led to the tragic events in today\u0027s case.\n\nFollow me on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sommer_sanchezyt/",
