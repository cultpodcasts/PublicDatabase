      "description": "Today I spoke with author Sasha Zouev, who grew up exposed to but never truly believing in Christianity as a worldview.  He now helps others to think through their truth claims to be sure they are considering the evidence.\n\nWe touched on many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 Learning that belief is often inherited, not discovered, which helps us reframe religion as culture, not truth.\n\u2022 Considering the afterlife as a gamble that includes the high emotional cost of faith-based living.\n\u2022 Realizing most Christians grieve death as if they don\u2019t really believe, which reveals the deep cracks in their theological confidence and actual worldview.\n\u2022 Observing how morality thrives without gods and that divinity is not required for goodness.\n\u2022 Studying mythological parallels to Jesus that unveil the man-made architecture of the Christian gospel.\n\u2022 Reflecting on childhood indoctrination that allowed fear and fantasy to sabotage emotional development.\n\u2022 Questioning faith and opening the door to lifelong critical thinking,\n\u2022 Recognizing that \u0022belonging\u0022 is weaponized in religious communities that easily replace actual connection with a fake one.\n\u2022 Facing the finality of death without illusion and having a deeper reverence for the present moment.\n\u2022 Accepting that meaning can be made, not given, and that we have the power to define and live a beautiful life.\n\nMany thanks to Sasha for sharing his story!\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nConnect with Sasha:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Tim-Giant-Teapot-Sasha-Zouev/dp/1916345174/\n\nAnyone who wants to check out a free low-res e-book before they buy can email zouevkidsbooks@gmail.com and they will send you one.\n\nIG: @zouev.kids.books\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very needed and appreciated!\n\nOne-time donations:\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nCashApp: $HarmonicAtheist\nZelle email: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nMonthly donations:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nYou can also \u0022Join\u0022 the Harmonic Atheist YT channel to get access to perks, which will be coming soon:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrPKXNg9PAL6bROvsaUFvAA/join\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nWant to create live streams like this?

Mariann Budde, who gave the homily at the national prayer service held on President Trump\u0027s Inauguration Day and spoke truth to power as she asked him to have mercy on those in the country who are now scared.\n\nWe touched on many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 How communities of faith and of no faith can stand together in the fight to protect the marginalized and oppressed, despite those in power working aggressively to harm them.\n\u2022 Seeing that racism is being cloaked in the language of patriotism, and that white supremacy is at the core of much of the Trump administration\u0027s policies.\n\u2022 Naming racism for what it is and speaking boldly against it instead of being swept up in the rhetoric and propaganda or being guilty of complicity through silence.\n\u2022 The importance of opposing Christian nationalism and authoritarianism as we come to grips with our human tendency toward extreme tribalism.\n\u2022 Defending pluralism and democracy rather than letting religion be a weapon for cultural dominance.\n\u2022 Galvanizing our anger toward speaking up against injustice while giving ourselves space to lament the cultural erosion that is being orchestrated by the Trump administration.\n\u2022 What Jesus would do if he were here today -- and how the Trump administration would treat him.\n\nMany thanks to Rev. Budde for her public voice in these matters and for sharing her insights with us today!\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nConnect with Rev.

      "description": "Today I spoke with Dr. Aaron Adair regarding his research paper, \u0022Justin Martyr and the Epistemology of Mythology.\u0022  We discussed the fascinating perspectives of early church apologists and the surrounding mythology-filled culture.\n\nWe touched on many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 Understanding how early Christian apologist and philosopher Justin Martyr viewed mythology, interpreting the Gospels allegorically rather than literally.\n\u2022 Seeing Christianity\u2019s many shared themes with older mythologies, despite early Christians justifying it by claiming that demons preemptively imitated Christ\u2019s story.\n\u2022 Appreciating that the Gospels were an evolving text rather than a fixed historical account.\n\u2022 Seeing how early Christians tried to harmonize the contradictions in the Gospel stories, such as the Star of Bethlehem and Jesus\u2019 triumphal entry, through a symbolic rather than historical approach.\n\u2022 Reflecting on how early Christian perspectives aligned strongly with mystery cult traditions, where initiates progress through deeper symbolic interpretations rather than literal history.\n\u2022 Recognizing the ancient cosmic myths that may have influenced early Christian theology.\n\u2022 Suggesting that Christianity may have developed from myth to history rather than history to myth.\n\nThanks to Dr. Adair for his amazing research and insights!\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nConnect with Dr. Adair:\n\nAmazon page:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/stores/Aaron-Adair/author/B00FRK6Q7O\n\nYouTube:\n @AaronAdair \n\nBlog\nhttps://gilgamesh42.wordpress.com/ \n\nTwitter page\nhttps://twitter.com/adair_aaron\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very needed and appreciated!\n\nOne-time donations:\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nZelle email: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nMonthly donations:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nYou can also \u0022Join\u0022 the Harmonic Atheist YT channel to get access to perks, which will be coming soon:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrPKXNg9PAL6bROvsaUFvAA/join\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nWant to create live streams like this?

He has become an activist for protecting victims of witch hunts and for promoting rationality, especially in schools.\n\nWe touched on many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 How supernatural beliefs drain people\u0027s sense of compassion and care for fellow humans, and removes their logic and rationality.\n\u2022 Realizing that ignorance is disease that ends up being toxic and deadly.\n\u2022 Struggling against people who don\u0027t have the conscience to tell themselves that they are deceiving and exploiting people through religion.\n\u2022 Seeing how religion encourages people to lie to themselves, and to not to say what they are really thinking when they are questioning the religion\u0027s claims.\n\u2022 Having the bravery to change culture as we realize that progress is not handed down for free but instead has a high price.\n\u2022 Understanding that many institutions incentivize magical thinking and leave no space for skepticism and reason.\n\u2022 The need for us to reward people in our society for being skeptical, rational, and critical thinkers.\n\u2022 Acknowledging the fearful reality that if we don\u2019t fight against religion now, the situation will be far worse in the future.\n\nMany thanks to Leo for sharing his story and insights!\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nConnect with Leo!\n\nwww.CritThink.Africa\n\nwww.AdvocacyForAllegedWitches.com\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/humanistsinternational \n\n _________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very needed and appreciated!\n\nOne-time donations:\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nZelle email: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nMonthly donations:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nYou can also \u0022Join\u0022 the Harmonic Atheist YT channel to get access to perks, which will be coming soon:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrPKXNg9PAL6bROvsaUFvAA/join\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nWant to create live streams like this?

      "description": "Today I spoke with Marissa Burt, a Christian author who joined me to discuss the issue of corporal punishment among Christians.\n\nWe touched on many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 How the Christian parenting empire shaped a generation of evangelical families and how false promises and myths about \u0022good Christian parenting\u0022 betrayed them.\n\u2022 The strong connection between blind adherence to religious principles and the neglect of critical self-reflection.\n\u2022 Understanding that how we raise our children can reflect deeper beliefs, often without questioning if those beliefs are truly beneficial.\n\u2022 The need for a more empathetic, psychologically informed approach to child rearing, especially in Christian homes.\n\u2022 Realizing that a lot of what Christians assume is biblical child-rearing is rooted more in culture than in the Bible.\n\u2022 Seeing that the intention behind the child rearing practices doesn\u0027t always align with their actual impact on children.\n\u2022 Acknowledging that parents\u0027 attempts at control in parenting often stems from fear, not love or guidance.\n\u2022 The importance of empathy being at the core of any teaching or correction.\n\u2022 The fearful reality that while every parenting system has flaws, few are as intricately defended as religious ones.\n\u2022 Observing families who once embraced strict religious parenting now grappling with the consequences in their adult children.\n\u2022 How the act of breaking cycles of harmful beliefs and practices is an act of courage and love.\n\u2022 The need to look at our motivations as parents to reveal biases we\u0027ve disguised as \u0027truth.\u0027\n\u2022 Shifting from fear-based discipline to love-based guidance is a journey worth taking.\n\u2022 The need to learn from the voices of those who were hurt by bad parenting ideas, not silence them.\n\u2022 Being willing to give your child the example of owning up to mistakes.\n\u2022 Acknowledging that harm that was done in abusive parenting doesn\u2019t invalidate the good intentions behind it but invites admission of what was done, in order to start the process of forgiveness and healing.\n\nThanks to Marissa for sharing her insights!\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nConnect with Marissa:\n\nhttps://marissaburt.com/\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/MarissaBurt\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@inthewaytheyshouldgo\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B0055WR1O6/allbooks\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very needed and appreciated!\n\nOne-time donations:\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nZelle email: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nMonthly donations:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nYou can also \u0022Join\u0022 the Harmonic Atheist YT channel to get access to perks, which will be coming soon:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrPKXNg9PAL6bROvsaUFvAA/join\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nWant to create live streams like this?

      "description": "Today I spoke with David Fitzgerald, a renowned atheist activist, historical researcher, and novelist whose books have been pivotal for the deconstructing community as we work to understand the origins and evolution of Christianity.\n\nWe touched on many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 The inspiration behind studying mythicism, which challenges the historical existence of Jesus and other religious figures.\n\u2022 The various patterns seen across different religions.\n\u2022 The inconsistencies between the Gospels and how they depict various versions of Jesus.\n\u2022 Uncovering common mythological elements across religions, including parallels between figures like Jesus, Buddha, and Muhammad.\n\u2022 The influence of Zoroastrianism on Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.\n\u2022 Recent archaeological and scholarly discoveries challenge the conventional timelines of the Old Testament\u0027s origins.\n\u2022 Understanding that religion is an evolutionary process shaped by historical and political factors.\n\u2022 The influence of Egyptian, Babylonian, and Persian traditions on Jewish scriptures.\n\u2022 How early Christian figures like Paul had differing visions for the religion, contributing to its diversity.\n\u2022 How religious leaders manipulated Christianity to shape beliefs and control narratives.\n\u2022 How understanding the origins and evolution of religion can aid in healing from religious trauma.\n\nMany thanks to David for sharing his story and insights!\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nConnect with David!\nhttps://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B004ASD9M4/allbooks\n\nMarketing the Messiah:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Marketing-Messiah-Cameron-Reilly/dp/B08NLVCRF9/\n\nMy first interview with David:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNcF5Gop2hI\n\n_________________________________________\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very needed and appreciated!\n\nOne-time donations:\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nZelle email: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nMonthly donations:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nYou can also \u0022Join\u0022 the Harmonic Atheist YT channel to get access to perks, which will be coming soon:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrPKXNg9PAL6bROvsaUFvAA/join\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nWant to create live streams like this?

      "description": "Today I spoke with April Ajoy, who grew up in a Pentecostal family with deep evangelical roots and gave her life to share the Gospel, but heavily deconstructed her faith as she examined toxic aspects of Christianity.\n\nWe touched on many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 Traveling with her family to do ministry through music and preaching, which exposed her to various global cultures.\n\u2022 Along with her family, being intensely focused on converting others, which caused anxiety and guilt whenever she failed to witness effectively.\n\u2022 Experiencing intense childhood anxiety caused by fear of being \u0022left behind\u0022 during the Rapture.\n\u2022 Believing in miracles and faith healing for many years but starting to experience significant doubts after her father passed away from cancer despite prayers and expectations of healing.\n\u2022 Living by strict modesty rules and teachings about purity which made her feel responsible for male thoughts and behavior.\n\u2022 Feeling unexpected joy for LGBTQ couples when gay marriage was legalized, which conflicted with her evangelical teachings.\n\u2022 Shifting her theology further when her brother came out as gay, as she saw his suffering and realized that sexuality wasn\u0027t a choice.\n\u2022 Being disillusioned by evangelical support for Donald Trump, despite his major character flaws which contradicted the \u0022morality-first\u0022 ideals April grew up with.\n\u2022 Becoming increasingly concerned as she saw how Christian nationalism seeks to create a theocracy, using scripture to oppress marginalized communities and legislate morality.\n\u2022 While still embracing the teachings of Jesus, holding her beliefs more loosely, embracing uncertainty, and rejecting fear-based doctrines like hell.\n\u2022 Aiming to raise awareness, through her book and her activism, about the dangers of Christian nationalism and promote a more inclusive society.\n\nMany thanks to April for sharing her story with us today!\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nConnect with April!\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Star-Spangled-Jesus-Leaving-Christian-Nationalism/dp/B0CWJTPWGJ/\n\nTiktok:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@UC96OPwaQAD5Ly_uiv893Kcg \nIG:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/aprilajoy/\nFB:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100082633787045\n\nApril \u0026 Beecher\u0027s engagement:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2X1EGWHebo\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very needed and appreciated!\n\nOne-time donations:\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nZelle email: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nMonthly donations:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nYou can also \u0022Join\u0022 the Harmonic Atheist YT channel to get access to perks, which will be coming soon:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrPKXNg9PAL6bROvsaUFvAA/join\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nWant to create live streams like this?

      "description": "Today I spoke with Larenzo Reid, who grew up in a Baptist environment and tried for decades to understand and defend the faith, but ultimately deconverted as the truth claims of Christianity fell apart.\n\nWe touched on many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 Attending church regularly as a child, but sensing that even at a young age, he was already questioning his beliefs.\n\u2022 Sensing his doubts increase when a pastor incorrectly interpreted the story of the \u0022eye of the needle,\u0022 saying that rich people go to hell, which led him to seek answers by studying the Bible and other sources independently.\n\u2022 Noticing inconsistencies in the teachings and interpretations of pastors, who often lacked historical and cultural context.\n\u2022 Finding his questions about were not welcomed by church leaders, who saw them as challenges to their authority.\n\u2022 Being encouraged by his family to pursue his intellectual curiosity and to speak his mind, which helped him to continue exploring his doubts despite backlash from the church.\n\u2022 Desiring not to leave Christianity but to understand it better and to be a more devout Christian by grasping the historical and cultural backgrounds of biblical stories.\n\u2022 Traveling to Israel, Rome, and other places, where he saw firsthand the historical and archaeological contexts of biblical stories, further fueling his doubts.\n\u2022 Finding that his firsthand experiences, combined with his independent studies, were leading him to see contradictions between what he was taught in church and what he observed in reality, particularly regarding the story of Jesus, the Old Testament, and the role of Christianity in history.\n\u2022 Criticizing the Bible\u0027s morality, especially concerning issues like slavery, genocide, and child sacrifice, which he found inconsistent with the idea of a benevolent deity.\n\u2022 Exploring other philosophies, such as Stoicism and Hermeticism, which provided alternative frameworks to understand life and the universe, and ultimately helping him overcome his fear of death and let go of the concept of heaven and hell.\n\u2022 Fully deconverting from Christianity, and consequently facing pushback, criticism, and even death threats from Christians.\n\u2022 Hearing pastors privately acknowledge the inaccuracies in their teachings but feeling trapped by financial obligations and fear of community backlash.\n\u2022 Starting his YouTube channel, \u0022Deconstructing Christianity,\u0022 originally as a resource for his children, but now a platform to help others who are questioning their faith.\n\u2022 Emphasizing the importance of understanding oneself and pursuing personal growth outside of religious structures and advocating for self-love and self-trust.\n\nMany thanks to Larenzo for sharing his story!\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nConnect with Larenzo!\n\nYouTube:\n@CoachRenz33 \n\nFacebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/coachrenz33\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very needed and appreciated!\n\nOne-time donations:\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nZelle email: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nMonthly donations:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nYou can also \u0022Join\u0022 the Harmonic Atheist YT channel to get access to perks, which will be coming soon:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrPKXNg9PAL6bROvsaUFvAA/join\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nWant to create live streams like this?

      "description": "Today I spoke with Timmy Gibson, who grew up in a Pentecostal church, placed his faith in Jesus at a young age, and became a Pastor for 30 years before ultimately deconverting from Christianity.\n\nWe touched on many topics including:\n\n\u2022 Being encouraged to \u0022check his brain at the door,\u0022 have blind faith, and to stop worrying about anything that didn\u0027t make sense, because god\u0027s ways were seen as far above ours.\n\u2022 Feeling like his ministry and evangelism were directly and positively impacting people\u0027s eternal destinies.\n\u2022 Starting to deconstruct as he read the book \u0022Sapiens\u0022 and learned about evolution and Neanderthals.\n\u2022 Moving from Fundamentalist Christianity to a more liberal perspective as he shifted his positions, especially regarding hell and homosexuality.\n\u2022 Realizing the psychopathic nature of the Yahweh character in the Old Testament.\n\u2022 Finding donations to his church drop exponentially as he publicly affirmed the LGBTQ community.\n\u2022 Being told by other pastors that he needed to keep his changing perspectives to himself.\n\u2022 Slowly concluding that people who subscribe to the Christian worldview are deluded.\n\u2022 Realizing that we were both the victims and the perpetrators of the Christian belief system and therefore feeling compelled to try to undo some of the damage we had done during our time in Christian ministry.\n\u2022 Experiencing much more peace after escaping Christianity.\n\nThanks to Timmy for sharing his story and insights!\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nCheck out Timmy\u0027s YT channel:\n @timmygibsonkc  \n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nMentioned in this video:\nCults to consciousness YT channel\n @CultstoConsciousness  \n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very needed and appreciated!\n\nOne-time donations:\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nZelle email: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nMonthly donations:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nYou can also \u0022Join\u0022 the Harmonic Atheist YT channel to get access to perks, which will be coming soon:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrPKXNg9PAL6bROvsaUFvAA/join\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Kazuya / Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://artlist.io/royalty-free-music/song/friends/2825\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nIf you are facing emotional distress, please call 911 or the National Suicide Hotline \n1-800-273-8255.",

      "description": "Today I spoke with Gloria Froese, who grew up in the Church of God Restoration cult, a group that tried to crush and cripple her with its extremist ideologies and practices.  Gloria ultimately escaped as she examined the claims of the group and of Christianity as a whole.\n\nWe touched on many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 Seeing her parents pursue homeschooling so they could keep the kids separate from the \u0022world\u0022 and ensure a pure and sheltered educational experience for their children.\n\u2022 Being loved-bombed by an ultra-conservative Church of God group that had emotionally charged worship service experiences.\n\u2022 Being repeatedly and increasingly pressured by her mother to \u0022get saved\u0022 by going to the front of the church when the invitation was given, even though she had already made a profession of faith earlier in her childhood.\n\u2022 Seeing other children in the church being physically abused and psychologically coerced into \u0022getting saved.\u0022\n\u2022 Being mocked by other girls at church because she was wearing a short-sleeved dress.\n\u2022 Being preached at by her pastor, as a child, about how Christ\u0027s sufferings were on her behalf, because of her wickedness.\n\u2022 Hearing church leaders claim to have the authority and power to take away someone\u0027s salvation.\n\u2022 How the push for extreme purity in the church leads to facades that allows believers to temporarily hide their deviant behavior.\n\u2022 Hearing the church legislate and repress sexuality within marriage, insisting on hyper modesty even in the bedroom.\n\u2022 Being told that she could not marry anyone she was physically attracted to, and instead had to marry whomever the church told her to marry.\n\u2022 Hearing messages of intense hatred toward homosexuals.\n\u2022 Facing pervasive purity culture where blouses had to go up to the neck, sleeves to the wrists, dresses to the ankle, and they had to wear stockings at all times.\n\u2022 Enduring the myriad ways the church purposely fostered ignorance, especially about biology and sexuality.\n\u2022 As a young person, having almost no idea how sexuality worked, and learning to completely turn off the aspects of sexuality she was aware of.\n\u2022 Facing agony through her teenage years based on the intense legalism, restrictions, lack of information, and her prescribed role and future within the community.\n\u2022 Seeing her church go through an intense, angry split that led many to leave.\n\u2022 Being harassed by church members to get her to remain in the church even as her parents were moving on from it, but ultimately choosing to escape.\n\u2022 Attending a liberal arts Christian college where the professors provided various interpretations of different topics but didn\u0027t dogmatically say which one was the sole correct version.\n\u2022 Beginning to question her faith and worldview, slowly at first, but eventually realizing that Christianity is mythology and that she had been lied to her whole life.\n\u2022 Understanding how the ultra-conservative arrogant Christian mindset acts like a drug.\n\u2022 Experiencing much more peace after deconverting than she ever had as a Christian.\n\nMany thanks to Gloria for sharing her story and insights!\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\nRead more about Gloria\u0027s story:\nhttps://www.mennotoba.com/church-of-god-restoration-gloria-froese/\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nPlease subscribe to my other channels (many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached on FB at: harmonictim \nOr by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is needed and appreciated!\n\nOne time\nPayPal (preferred):      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nZelle email: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n\n_________________________________________",

Brief mention of suicide ideation, self-harm, and anorexia.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nToday I spoke with Emilie Paige Dye, who grew up in an evangelical household and placed her faith in Jesus at a young age, but ultimately deconverted after experiencing years of mistreatment by the church and examining the truth claims of Christianity.\n\nWe touched on many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 Getting saved early in life and then repeatedly rededicating her life to Jesus and repenting of sin to be sure she was truly saved.\n\u2022 Being terrified of the Rapture and of being \u0022left behind.\u0022\n\u2022 Growing closer to the Lord, reading through the entire Bible many times, deepening her love for Jesus and the Gospel, and pursuing experiences of closeness to god.\n\u2022 Seeing her parents hyper focused on getting their theology correct to the point that they had to switch churches frequently.\n\u2022 Attending Logos School, which is part of the ministry of Doug Wilson and Christ Church in Moscow, Idaho.\n\u2022 Due to purity culture, being scared of male-female relationships and knowing very little about her own body, while seeing virginity culture portrayed as the romantic ideal, especially in the context where the fathers are responsible to keep their daughters pure until marriage.\n\u2022 Being intentionally groomed over time by an older male theology teacher at Logos School, who was also an Elder at Christ Church and one of her spiritual authorities, in the larger context of male leaders publicly touching and giving back rubs to some of the teenage girls on a regular basis.\n\u2022 Being so overwhelmed with shame that she felt like she could not talk to anyone about the ongoing molestation.\n\u2022 Hearing her abuser try to keep her in a cycle of shame by telling her she was culpable for being impure, that she had betrayed her parents, and that she had ruined herself for her future husband, even right after he had assaulted her, and then insisting she beg his forgiveness, which he would follow up by comforting her in her shame, starting the cycle of molestation all over again.\n\u2022 Seeing the church community rally around her abuser as he confessed to a small portion of his severe abuses.\n\u2022 Feeling ostracized by the Christ Church community as her story came to light.\n\u2022 Being repeatedly blamed for the situation, despite being underage and despite the power dynamics at play in school and church.\n\u2022 Realizing that Christians are hyper-sexualizing children through purity culture.\n\u2022 Thinking through the ways that the Christian worldview is inherently abusive to women as calls them seductresses and labels them as inferior, and then blames, shames, and silences them.\n\u2022 Understanding that she did not need the church to be healthy or thrive, and subsequently realizing that god was not real.\n\u2022 Experiencing much more joy and peace after escaping Christianity than she ever had as a Christian.\n\nMany thanks to Emilie for sharing her story, as well as for the many ways that her bravery and resilience have empowered others to tell their stories and heal from the Christ Church cult.\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nDig deeper:\n\nExamining Doug Wilson and Moscow, Idaho FB group \u0026 IG page:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ExaminingMoscow\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/examiningmoscow/\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nIf anyone else who has escaped from the Christ Church cult is interested in sharing their story, please contact me!  harmonicatheist@yahoo.com \n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n*** Please subscribe to my other channels ***\n(many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",

His research on Christian origins led him to write several books about the mythological origins of the Jesus character and of Christianity.\n\nWe touched on many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 Realizing that the Synoptic gospels used Paul\u0027s teachings to craft their stories, and that the authors of Matthew and Luke then edited and altered the Gospel of Mark in their versions of the Jesus story.\n\u2022 Piecing together that specific events which occurred in first century Palestine are described in both the Dead Sea Scrolls and in Paul\u2019s letters, from different points of view.\n\u2022 Piecing together Paul\u0027s backstory, that he was probably sent out by the Qumran community to share their message, but he altered it as he invented Christianity, broke his oath, became a traitor to the Qumran community rules, and became known as \u0022the Spouter of Lies.\u0022\n\u2022 The idea that Jesus was a mythological being crucified in the levels of heaven by demons.\n\u2022 How Paul and Qumran community used Pesher as a way to glean a fresh meaning from the Old Testament.\n\u2022 How the Jerusalem church leaders were opposed to Paul and believed in a different Jesus who had not been crucified.\n\u2022 Seeing that Paul\u0027s letters are his trying to keep his churches in his group, versus siding with the Qumran group.\n\u2022 Noticing the stark contrast between Paul\u0027s message of grace versus his repeatedly graceless and rude personality and interactions with others.\n\u2022 Understanding that the Gospel of Mark is a Midrash on Old Testament passages, as Mark rewrites the Old Testament stories to create the many \u0022new\u0022 stories about the Jesus character.\n\u2022 Understanding that canonical Mark has been redacted and the stories re-ordered.\n\u2022 The possibility that the Jerusalem apostles murdered Paul and then covered it up.\n\nMany thanks to David for sharing his story, research, and insights!\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nPick up David\u0027s books!\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B0BF38RYLF/allbooks\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nPlease subscribe to my other channels (many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nOne time\nPayPal (preferred):      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nZelle email: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n\n_________________________________________",

      "description": "Today I spoke with Daniel Dacombe, who grew up in a Christian home, gave his life to Jesus as a young person, and eventually attended Bible College and entered ministry, but ultimately deconverted as he examined the truth claims of Christianity.\n\nWe touched on many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 Growing up in a Christian environment that was free of many of the heavily toxic ideas often taught in Evangelicalism.\n\u2022 Noticing strong differences between the harsh Yahweh character of the Old Testament and the more gracious character of Jesus in the New Testament, despite the apologetics industry trying to pretend that those differences aren\u0027t there.\n\u2022 The relationship between how our parents treated us and how we viewed the god character as we grew up.\n\u2022 Attending a Mennonite Brethren Church and becoming serious about his faith and walk with the Lord.\n\u2022 Trying in vain for many years to experiencing god and feel his presence.\n\u2022 Hearing many Christians strongly disparage other forms of Christianity.\n\u2022 Unpacking how our belief systems are created and maintained.\n\u2022 Seeing that we tend to form our beliefs backwards, intuiting our beliefs based on what seems true at first glance, and then proceeding to try to rationalize those beliefs.\n\u2022 Observing that our brains react to perceived threats to our strongly held beliefs and values in the same way we could react to a perceived physical threat.\n\u2022 Going to seminary and starting ministry in order to be involved in sharing the Gospel, while at the same time realizing that he was facing increasing cognitive dissonance about the claims of Christianity, especially as he realized that the answers from Christian apologists were extremely poor.\n\u2022 Moving into progressive Christianity for a season as he worked through his persistent suspicions about the claims of Christianity.\n\u2022 Seeing the need to not subscribe to supernatural explanations with bad evidence and weak arguments when natural explanations with good evidence are available.\n\u2022 Starting to see that the god construct had just been a \u0022useful fiction.\u0022\n\u2022 Fully deconverting and feeling immense pain and loss, as well as anger at what he had gone through.\n\u2022 Realizing that he would never again see people who had already died.\n\u2022 Embracing intellectual humility in order to leave room for growth, change, and new ideas.\n\u2022 The importance of starting new secular traditions.\n\nThanks to Daniel for sharing his story and insights!\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nPlease subscribe to my other channels (many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nOne time\nPayPal (preferred):      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nZelle email: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n\n_________________________________________",

In addition, the possibility that what they believe is not true is so daunting for many believers that they cannot bring themselves to seriously address even the most obvious problems with their belief system.\n\u2022 The importance of not giving in to toxic shame.\n\u2022 Acknowledging that childhood indoctrination is psychological child abuse.\n\nThanks to Tim for sharing his story, for his many books, and for all he does for the community!\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\nRead Tim\u0027s books:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/stores/Tim-Sledge/author/B00J8LXMSO\n\nBuy his greeting cards:\ntheencouragement.store\n\nFollow Tim Sledge on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/Goodbye_Jesus\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nPlease subscribe to my other channels (many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nOne time\nPayPal (preferred):      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nMonthly\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",

      "description": "Today I spoke with Ricky Johnson and his son, Austin Johnson.  Ricky grew up in Laestadian Lutheranism, but ultimately deconverted as he investigated the truth claims of Christianity.  Austin grew up exposed to Christianity but saw through its claims early in life and was able to easily escape it.\n\nWe discussed many topics, including:\n\nFor Ricky:\n\u2022 Not being allowed to play or watch sports much, as a young man, in order to avoid having sports become an idol.\n\u2022 Being warned to not associate with worldly people, practices, and ideas.\n\u2022 Being taught that true Christians can forgive the sins of other Christians.\n\u2022 Feeling like he was not breaking down and crying hard enough, like other Christians in his church, as part of repentance for their sins.\n\u2022 Having to adhere to whatever advice the preachers give and whatever the church elders decide is a sin.\n\u2022 Trying to balance the overwhelming threat of hell with the injunction to experience the joy of the Lord.\n\u2022 Never feeling, as a Christian, that he could \u0022rest\u0022 in the security and peace of his salvation.\n\u2022 Realizing that he had been conditioned his whole life to be afraid of evidence and information, for fear of losing his Christianity.\n\u2022 Learning for the first time that many stories in the Bible were copied from earlier mythologies.\n\u2022 Concluding that Christianity is just a man-made construct.\n\u2022 Facing the need to be honest and authentic in the context of Christians who will ostracize and hate you for leaving.\n\u2022 Understanding that vulnerable people can be primed for indoctrination by churches that \u0022offer a solution.\u0022 \n\u2022 Experiencing some church members questioning his wife about her love for him and advising her to not talk with him about religion, which appeared like they were trying to drive a wedge between them.\n\u2022 Realizing the even greater love and empathy that develops after escaping Christianity.\n\u2022 Dealing with the embarrassment of ever having believed in Christianity and for trying so hard to keep believing it, but understanding that psychological conditioning can profoundly overpower our minds.\n\u2022 How Christians set up the paradigm of \u0022us vs. them\u0022 and \u0022Christian vs. other,\u0022 but how wonderful it is to lose that dynamic and perspective upon deconversion.\n\u2022 The bizarre experience of grieving the loss of your worldview, during deconversion, while also starting to receive rudeness and animosity from Christians.\n\nFor Austin:\n\u2022 Feeling like the Christian stories, theology, and worldview never added up.\n\u2022 How Christians \u0022poison the well\u0022 against non-Christian ideas and information.\n\u2022 Admitting that the Yahweh character appears to be purposefully trying to trick people and sow confusion, and ultimately that the Yahweh character does not live out the attributes that Christian theology ascribes to him.\n\u2022 Dealing with the loss of the afterlife concept.\n\u2022 After deconversion, the importance of studying moral philosophy to rebuild your moral underpinning and to ultimately lead by example without a theological underpinning.\n\nMany thanks to Ricky and Austin for sharing their stories!\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nWatch Ricky and Austin\u0027s interviews on Jonathan Pearce\u0027s channel, a Tippling Philosopher (https://www.youtube.com/@ATipplingPhilosopher/)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3iMqRnRpOU\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkH4HUhJHS4\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaNQZJewQ9w\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nPlease subscribe to my other channels (many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nOne time\nPayPal (preferred):      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nMonthly\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n\n_________________________________________",

      "description": "T/W - Today\u0027s guest is a Christian.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nToday I spoke with Eric Runge, who attended Christ Church (in Moscow, Idaho) for 4 years and taught at their school, but was ultimately harassed and threatened by leadership, enabling him to see through their mind control tactics and escape.\n\nWe discussed many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 How Doug Wilson (DW) and the Christ Church (CC) community give a vibe that they have \u0022all the answers.\u0022\n\u2022 Going through unaccredited marital counseling with DW that proved to be very shallow.\n\u2022 Realizing that he had been a victim of spiritual abuse by DW and CC.\n\u2022 Observing the CC culture that mocked other evangelical Christians and saw them as \u0022stupid idiots\u0022 over theological and cultural differences.\n\u2022 How individual \u0022Christian\u0022 freedoms are not respected at CC.\nObserving CC push a narrative that men in general are ravenous sexual wolves that will hurt innocent girls but that sex in marriage resolves the temptations.\n\u2022 Observing DW\u0027s puritan, holier-than thou, elitist mentality.\n\u2022 The implication at CC that if you don\u0027t conform to their ways of thinking and living, you will be cast out and socially shamed.\n\u2022 Being harassed, pressured, and threatened by Elder Mike Lawyer.\n\u2022 How CC effectively covers up abusers, and the abused end up getting attacked as a result.\n\u2022 The authoritarian and bullying mindset practiced by DW and CC leadership.\n\u2022 How Nouthetic counseling, which is practiced at CC, shallowly teaches people to \u0022just believe and obey the Bible.\u0022\n\u2022 The dynamic that people are fearful of DW, even when they move to other states and other countries.\n\u2022 The strong element of control, including mind control, as well as threats, at CC.\n\u2022 How the CC culture leads to people feeling very pressured to hand over their consent, stop being an individual agent, and simply conform -- or risk oppression and scorn.\n\u2022 The importance of acknowledging and healing from religious trauma, especially from a secular humanist perspective.\n\u2022 The crucial need to have and protect a strong sense of individuality and self, in order to protect ourselves from the damage done by groups like CC.\n\nMany thanks to Eric for sharing his story and insights!\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nDig deeper:\n\nExamining Doug Wilson and Moscow, Idaho FB group \u0026 IG page:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ExaminingMoscow\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/examiningmoscow/\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nIf anyone else who has escaped from the Christ Church cult is interested in sharing their story, please contact me!  harmonicatheist@yahoo.com \n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nPlease subscribe to my other channels (many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",

      "description": "Today I spoke with Kelsey Gallert, who grew up in a mainstream Evangelical and Pentecostal environment, but as an adult moved through Independent Fundamental Baptist and Torah Observance / Hebrew roots perspectives before ultimately deconverting as she investigated the mythological origins of Christianity.\n\nWe discussed many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 Watching people in church being \u0022slain in the spirit.\u0022\n\u2022 Intensely hungering for the Spirit and being concerned about people around her who didn\u0027t share that hunger.\n\u2022 Feeling the struggle to maintain a strong \u0022mountaintop experience\u0022 in daily life.\n\u2022 Sensing that the Yahweh character was sending her personal messages and life direction through her private devotions and prayer life.\n\u2022 \u0022Pleading the blood\u0022 for protection and victory in various life situations.\n\u2022 Hearing strong preaching about her being profoundly wicked, to the point that she questioned her previous professions of faith in Jesus.\n\u2022 Realizing that other religions were acting out the same way as Pentecostals do.\n\u2022 Fearing the Rapture / Tribulation and being left behind.\n\u2022 Being drawn into the Hebrew Roots movement.\n\u2022 Feeling like the truth was too hard to find, as if the god character was intentionally making it difficult to find the truth, despite her sincere devotion to him.\n\u2022 Realizing that Jesus is a copy of demigods like Dionysius and Paul\u0027s conversion on the road to Damascus is based on Euripides\u0027 Bacchae.\n\u2022 Concluding that human sacrifice blood magic atonement is not reality.\n\u2022 Realizing that instead of trusting god this whole time, we\u0027ve actually just been trusting a bunch of unknown dead men who concocted and evolved Judaism and Christianity.\n\u2022 Admitting that the Yahweh character was portrayed as psychopathic and at the same time that we were trained to love him and gladly obey him.\n\u2022 Understanding that for many years the most important person in our lives was imaginary, leaving us free to connect with and love the real people in our lives.\n\u2022 Realizing that she had felt that she used to have an imaginary friend near her, but that after deconversion, the imaginary friend was no longer there.\n\u2022 Experiencing much more peace after deconversion.\n\u2022 The importance of imparting a secular morality to the next generation.\n\u2022 The struggle to not give into the existential OCD that can occur when we lose the Christian worldview and seek to give our lives meaning and purpose.\n\u2022 Dealing with the post-deconversion anger of how the proponents of Christianity broke our hearts, stole time from our lives, and lied to us about its origins.\n\nMany thanks to Kelsey for sharing her story!\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nMentioned in this video:\n\nJustin Best / Bullet Holes in the Bible\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@BulletHolesintheBible/videos\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nPlease subscribe to my other channels (many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",

      "description": "*** Trigger warning: sexual assault, child abuse and exploitation, childhood rape, pedophilia, suicide.\n\n____________________________________\n\nToday I spoke with Angel DeSantis, who grew up in the \u0022Children of God\u0022 Christian sex cult, but ultimately escaped as she examined the truth claims of the group, and of Christianity in general, and reclaimed her identity.\n\nWe discussed many topics, including: \n\n\u2022 Being indoctrinated to believe that the Antichrist and the End Times were coming very soon and that she was part of the Lord\u0027s End Time army.\n\u2022 Being told to prepare for rape by the Antichrist\u0027s soldiers, but to use that as a means to seduce them to believe in Jesus.\n\u2022 Seeing older women being sent out to do \u0022Flirty Fishing\u0022 to seduce men sexually and then invite them to become involved in the cult.\n\u2022 Being taught that your body belongs to the collective cult community, and consent was assumed.\n\u2022 Receiving punishment for being kind toward her own sister, as a means to push the narrative that the entire community was as important as her immediate family.\n\u2022 Hearing the Christian message of the Gospel of forgiveness of sin through Jesus altered into a works salvation message, focused primarily on whether the cult leaders where pleased with you.\n\u2022 Seeing the cult leaders portray the known Christian characters (such as Yahweh, Jesus, the Holy Spirit, the Angel Gabriel, the Virgin Mary) in hyper-sexual terms.\n\u2022 How the cult grooming process led to parents failing to see the danger or to protect their own children.\n\u2022 How their worldview about god was highly authoritarian, where he was easily displeased with people, based on the cult leaders\u0027 perspectives.\n\u2022 How the Yahweh character is shown as promising unconditional love yet with overwhelming conditions.\n\u2022 How Christianity keeps people deeply stuck in cognitive dissonance because confused people are easier to control.\n\u2022 How \u0022purity culture\u0022 in the cult was reversed, encouraging women to show as much skin as possible and encouraging young men to \u0022claw at\u0022 a woman\u0027s body.\n\u2022 Hearing women being encouraged to not fight rape, but to see it as part of the will and plan of god.\n\u2022 How the ultra-patriarchal and misogynistic mentalities of the cult saw women primarily as sex objects and childbearing objects.\n\u2022 The extreme sheltering the cult imposed on members, so much that people who chose to leave would find their quality of life so poor that they would be compelled to return.\n\u2022 Seeing all other Christians as foolish and unliberated.\n\u2022 Being taught that heaven was basically an orgy scene.\n\u2022 The importance of being self-aware enough to see red flags in our lives, worldviews, and relationships so that we can be mentally healthy and pass on healthiness to the next generation.\n\u2022 The importance of autonomy and logical thinking in escaping fundamentalist religions.\n\u2022 The importance of \u0022setting a bar\u0022 that thoughts need to be 1) true and 2) useful, in order to be thoughts we are willing to entertain ... and rejecting any which don\u0027t meet that criteria.\n\u2022 Slowly walking toward things that lead you to peace and health, and away from toxic ideas.\n\u2022 How the Christian narrative actively degrades your sense of self.\n\u2022 After deconversion, the importance of building yourself from ground zero as you discover and create your identity apart from the cult worldview.\n\nMany thanks to Angel for sharing her story!\n\n\n____________________________________\n\nConnect with Angel!\n\nwww.angeldesantis.com\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@AngelDeSantis\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@angeldesantis3641/videos\n\n____________________________________\n\nLearn more about the \u0022Children of God\u0022 Christian sex cult:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@childrenofgodcultdocumentr9813/videos\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n*** Please subscribe to my other channels ***\n(many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",

      "description": "Today I spoke with Suzette Halterman, who grew up as a Latter Day Saint (Mormon), but ultimately shifted her beliefs and worldview as she examined the truth claims of Christianity, and subsequently began to also help other couples who hold different beliefs.\n\nWe talked about many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 Learning about how the Mormon church\u0027s horrible history regarding the LBGTQ community, racism, and sexism.\n\u2022 Experiencing sexual harassment from a church leader in high school.\n\u2022 Unpacking the ways that the ultra-patriarchal dynamics of the LDS church deeply affected her psyche.\n\u2022 Becoming \u0022allergic\u0022 to the Christian worldview.\n\u2022 Deconstructing the all-male leadership of the LDS church, starting with Joseph Smith.\n\u2022 How our brains create \u0022emotional knowings\u0022 and categories that make it easier for us to remain in an easy \u0022black and white\u0022 mentality that can cause anxiety when we are faced with different opinions.\n\u2022 The LDS belief that you stay married forever, even into eternity, and how that affects LDS marriages where one person no longer believes in the afterlife.\n\u2022 The importance of the deconverted spouse being understanding and gracious to the still-believing spouse.\n\u2022 How a believing spouse is driven toward their need to make meaning out of the situation of their spouse deconverting and possibly driving them to anxiety, depression, and control tactics.\n\u2022 The experience of the believing spouse feeling threatened as they face the many uncertainties that are happening when their spouse deconverts.\n\u2022 The need for professional counseling help in order for mixed-faith marriages to survive and thrive.\n\u2022 The importance of knowing how your spouse\u0027s family of origin dealt with stress and change, in order to predict how they might respond to your worldview shift.\nHow to slowly create emotional safety and security for each other when one person starts questioning their beliefs.\n\u2022 Dealing healthily with being rejected and despised by the believing spouse.\n\u2022 The disconnect that occurs when people in a mix-faith marriage each try to convince each other of being smarter or wiser in their specific beliefs and values, and the need to instead \u0022meet in the middle\u0022 as much as possible.\n\u2022 Dealing honestly with non-negotiables in beliefs and worldviews, while still trying to find common ground where possible.\n\u2022 The importance of moving away from the need for both people in a relationship to be the same in order to connect emotionally and physically.\n\u2022 The importance of learning the tools of conflict resolution.\n\nThanks to Suzette for sharing her story and insights!\n\n______________________________\n\n\nConnect with Suzette:\n\nhttps://www.suzettehaltermancoaching.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/suzettehalterman\n\nInstagram:  @suzettehalterman\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n*** Please subscribe to my other channels ***\n(many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",

      "description": "T/W: sexual assault / childhood rape\n\n_________________________________________\n\nToday I spoke with Jo Lloyd Johnson, who was born into a church commune, placed her faith in Jesus at a young age, and wanted to be a pastor\u0027s wife, but ultimately deconverted as the claims of Christianity fell apart.\n\nWe discussed many topics, including: \n\n\u2022 Being taught that angels and demons were all around us and were interacting with people and places.\n\u2022 Due to purity culture, feeling like her womanhood was possibly bringing out evil thoughts in men.\n\u2022 Being told that any sins that she committed were the equivalent of her trampling on the blood of Jesus.\n\u2022 Growing seeing her primary gender role as becoming a wife in order to be her husband\u0027s helper and to support his dreams and vision.\n\u2022 Seeing feelings as evil, deceptive, and untrustworthy, and seeing female emotions as part of why Eve was deceived.\n\u2022 How women are portrayed in the Bible as a subservient afterthought.\n\u2022 Wearing a purity ring as a pledge to her future husband to stay pure until they married.\n\u2022 Feeling guilty whenever she showed \u0022too much skin\u0022 and garnered male attention toward her body.\n\u2022 Being taught that sexual urges were a man\u0027s battle, not a woman\u0027s, and that her role was to protect men\u0027s purity by having strict physical boundaries against his strong sexual urges toward her.\n\u2022 Being given almost no education about sex, consent, the menstrual period, etc. -- and being told that menstrual cramps and childbirth pains were part of inherited punishment from Eve in the garden of Eden.\n\u2022 Realizing that church culture and rape culture go hand-in-hand and that Christianity often grooms women for abuse.\n\u2022 Learning that speaking in tongues can put you in a trance and cause trauma flashbacks.\n\u2022 Dealing with PTSD from the repressed memory of childhood rape and the accompanying nightmares as it came to the surface.\n\u2022 Being told that counseling and therapy was not Biblical, and that she should just pray for miraculous healing instead, which was just a coping mechanism.\n\u2022 Dealing with the contextual messaging that she was less valuable and was \u0022damaged goods\u0022 because her virginity was already taken before marriage.\n\u2022 Anticipating sex as a duty in marriage, with no thought toward her own sexual pleasure.\n\u2022 Dealing with intense shame and guilt over sexual activity with her boyfriend while concurrently enjoying the beauty and healing of a boyfriend who accepted her and delighted in her.\n\u2022 Acknowledging that waiting until marriage to be sexually active would have actually been very damaging to her.\n\u2022 Being shunned by her church for having premarital sex.\n\u2022 Realizing that Bible stories of demon possession actually sound like mental illness.\n\u2022 Seeing how women are described in the Bible and treated in church as second-class citizens.\n\u2022 Studying the topic of hell and concluding that hell was never seen as a literal place, and thus it has always ever just been a fear tactic.\n\u2022 Realizing that Christians who think the Bible is history are often the least educated on the history of the Bible and the stories behind it.\n\u2022 Realizing that original sin was an evolved concept.\n\u2022 Realizing that the Jesus stories originally painted him as just a man, and that his deity was an evolved concept.\n\u2022 Admitting that there is no reason to think that the god of the Bible exists.\n\u2022 Facing the experience of severely disappointing family and loved ones who are still Christians.\n\u2022 Seeing the harm that Christianity does by trying to break a child\u0027s will.\n\u2022 How deconversion is like mourning a death, but Christians act like you were the cause of that death.\n\u2022 Having the preferred experienced of deconstructing at the same time as her spouse, so they could understand and support each other.\n\u2022 Confronting and healing from sexual and religious trauma and reclaiming her voice.\n\u2022 How the deconversion and healing process allows you to honor your inner self and to be yourself for the first time in your life.\n\nMany thanks to Jo for sharing her story in this interview and through her

      "description": "Trigger warning: sexual assault, depression\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nToday I spoke with Janine Harris, who grew up in an evangelical Christian environment and believed in Jesus, but ultimately deconverted as she evaluated the truth claims of Christianity, especially in light of comparative mythology.\n\nWe touched on many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 Believing that she was a sinner in need of a Savior, and that if she did not believe, the outcome in the afterlife would be eternal conscious torment in a literal hell.\n\u2022 Acknowledging that parts of the Gospels are extremely antisemitic.\n\u2022 Realizing that there were many red flags about the toxicity of the Christian worldview that we are now surprised we didn\u0027t see earlier.\n\u2022 Hearing Christians describe yoga as a demonic religion.\n\u2022 Taking seriously the command to \u0022pray without ceasing.\u0022\n\u2022 Wanting the Yahweh character to speak audibly to her.\n\u2022 Feeling pressure to not dance during worship, even though she wanted to.\n\u2022 As a Christian, doing missions trips focused on sharing the Gospel.\n\u2022 Being told by a very non-empathetic Christian leader to simply forgive a sexual assault she had endured earlier in life.\n\u2022 Seeing virginity elevated to such a high level that an unmarried woman who was not a virgin, whether by her voluntary choice or not, was seen as dirty, not as valuable of a potential marriage partner, and worth significantly less than a virgin.\n\u2022 Being pushed away by Christian young men because her very presence was a temptation, and they wanted to keep themselves ultra-pure for their future wives.\n\u2022 How purity culture can end up causing some people to be so closed off to eroticism that they are never able to achieve a sexual climax.\n\u2022 The importance of being able to see the opposite sex, both clothed and nude, in a non-sexual way.\n\u2022 Having concerns with different theological issues, while also beginning to fear -- in the context of Calvinism -- that the Yahweh character hadn\u0027t predestined/elected her to be saved.\n\u2022 Starting to look at early church history and canonicity in great detail and being shocked at the level of corruption and evolution of the narratives that she found.\n\u2022 Learning that many early Christians saw Yahweh as an evil god, and that Yahweh was originally part of a pantheon.\n\u2022 Realizing that a lot of the Bible is symbolic, and that it is difficult for people today to be aware of or understand.\n\u2022 Learning about how Buddhist, Mithraic, and Greco-Roman mystery cult mythology and astrotheology motifs were copied and woven into the New Testament.\n\u2022 Looking honestly at atrocities done in the name of Yahweh and Jesus, from Old Testament stories through the Crusades and up to current times.\n\u2022 Seeing that the real nature of Christian missions is colonialism.\n\u2022 Realizing that we were the ones who created the gods, and in our image as humans.\n\u2022 How Christian theology leads people to not really be \u0022present\u0022 because they are so focused on heaven and the afterlife and consequently seeing this life as just a taste of the true and \u0022real\u0022 life that begins after death.\n\u2022 Figuring out what we want to consider \u0022sacred\u0022 as we reclaim our identities after deconversion.\n\nMany thanks to Janine for sharing her story!\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nPlease check out Janine\u0027s YT channel!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@JanineHarris\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n*** Please subscribe to my other channels ***\n(many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",

      "description": "Today I spoke with Lars and Christie Cade, who shared in a previous interview their journey of deconversion from Christianity.  They returned today to talk about the myriad ways that purity culture caused damage and what their journey to recovery looked like.\n\nWe discussed many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 How human \u0022flesh\u0022 is repeatedly described in the Bible as bad and wicked.\n\u2022 Growing up with Christian parents who provided almost no education about sexuality.\n\u2022 How preaching against immorality and homosexuality reinforced the concept that sex is bad.\n\u2022 Hearing strong messages that \u0022true love waits\u0022 and that if you don\u0027t wait, you are tarnished and less valuable.\n\u2022 Feeling ashamed of having genitals.\n\u2022 Seeing the ways that religions often denigrate pleasure and set it up as something suspicious and to be ignored or repressed.\n\u2022 Seeing how virginity culture leads some people to feel like dying once they get married.\n\u2022 Realizing, after deconversion, that it is completely healthy to pursue sexual experiences based not on what the Bible dictates, but on what you people mutually agree to experience.\n\u2022 The beauty of \u0022being free to be yourself\u0022 sexually and to feel the total freedom to discuss your needs, desires, and fantasies.\n\u2022 The importance of being sexually uninhibited and without any shame.\n\u2022 How shame culture leads people to feel like they can never really share their true thoughts with others, even and especially their own spouse.\n\u2022 The importance of facing head-on the healing process as you recover from purity culture.\n\u2022 The importance of developing transparency and trust in our relationships.\n\u2022 How long-term sexual deprivation in marriage is a breach of trust.\n\nWe barely scratched the surface on these topics, and there are many other similar and relevant issues that we could tackle, so we will probably do some follow ups down the line ... stay tuned.\n\nMany thanks to Lars and Christie for sharing their story!\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nThe interview with Lars \u0026 Christie regarding their deconversion:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzD9v5ngtao\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n*** Please subscribe to my other channels ***\n(many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",

      "title": "Christianity is mythology ... and I no longer believe - Patrick Jones",
      "description": "Today I spoke with Patrick Jones, who grew up as a Southern Baptist and focused on missions, but ultimately deconverted as he seriously examined the claims and origins of Christianity.\n\nWe discussed many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 Being told that the Bible was completely inerrant and that the Earth was young.\n\u2022 Being taught that Catholics were bad, but then attending a Catholic school and realizing they were good people.\n\u2022 Realizing that the Bible had been interpreted very differently in other Christian traditions, and that some of those other traditions had encouraged their congregations to analyze all sides of a topic, think deeply, and possibly come to different conclusions.\n\u2022 Being set up with an \u0022Us versus Them\u0022 mentality regarding both non-Christians as well as other Christians who had a different theology.\n\u2022 Enjoying leadership roles in the church, especially in light of his passion for educating others.\n\u2022 Growing up feeling crushed by sin and completely guilty.\n\u2022 How music has evolved in the evangelical church to bring about strong emotional responses, especially in light of the contrast of the intense personal guilt versus the invitation to connect with and be forgiven by the Yahweh character.\n\u2022 Slowly dismantling Christianity over 20 years, so that the admission of full deconversion at the very end was not as painful as it is for others.\n\u2022 Sensing that most Christians were not really concerned about those around them regarding the Gospel or about social issues like poverty and racism.\n\u2022 Moving toward a progressive Christianity perspective that included the possibility of universal salvation.\n\u2022 Learning about how the church and its dogmatic theology suppressed sexuality over the centuries.\n\u2022 How purity culture was woven into Christian culture, including a body vs. spirit dualistic mentality, the critical need to preserve virginity until marriage, being in discipleship for accountability, confessing sinful thoughts, fighting masturbation and pornography, and seeing any sexual thought as wicked.\n\u2022 Hearing women refer to Yahweh as their \u0022Daddy\u0022 and Jesus as their \u0022Husband.\u0022\n\u2022 The season of deconversion when it truly hits you that \u0022this is all made up.\u0022\n\u2022 How a serious study of comparative mythology and folklore helps us see where Christian mythology evolved from, including how similar it is to other stories and practices from other ancient cults.\n\u2022 Admitting that there are massive gaps in our understanding of how the various streams of Judaism and Christianity started and evolved.\n\u2022 Realizing that through various flukes of history, we could easily have seen Pythagoreanism or Mithraism taking over the world instead of Christianity.\n\nThanks to Patrick for sharing his story!\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n*** Please subscribe to my other channels ***\n(many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",

      "description": "Today I spoke with Bruce Gerencser, who pastored mostly Baptist churches for 25 years until he realized that Christianity is mythology and fiction, and deconverted.\n\nWe discussed many topics including:\n\n\u2022 Attending Independent Fundamental Baptist (IFB) Churches, starting with Tim LaHaye\u0027s church (of the \u0022Left Behind\u0022 book series).\n\u2022 Feeling close to god as he grew up.\n\u2022 Saying the sinner\u0027s prayer at age 5 but rededicating his life as a teenager during a revival service and sharing with his church that he felt called to be a preacher.\n\u2022 Attending an IFB College to prepare for the ministry.\n\u2022 Hearing endless sermons about the need to fight against worldliness and sinfulness.\n\u2022 Thinking that god was leading and directing personally in his life.\n\u2022 Eventually realizing that the Bible is not inerrant or infallible, and that the Bible is full of errors and contradictions.\n\u2022 Realizing that Christianity is just mythology, and deconverting.\n\u2022 Sensing overwhelming peace upon deconversion.\n\u2022 Observing Christians frequently ostracize and act hateful toward deconverted Christians.\n\nThanks to Bruce for sharing his story and for his many contributions to the community!\n\n_________________________________________\n\nConnect with Bruce:\n\nhttps://brucegerencser.net\n\n_________________________________________\n\nMythVision:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@MythVisionPodcast/videos\n\nDragons in Genesis:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@DragonsinGenesisPodcast/videos\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n*** Please subscribe to my other channels ***\n(many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",

      "description": "Today I spoke with Belle Clark, who placed her faith in Jesus as a teenager, but eventually deconverted as she realized that the Christian worldview no longer made sense.\n\nWe discussed many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 Being drawn to the motif of Yahweh being a caring Father figure who cared about and loved her.\n\u2022 Being taught by the church that she was sinful, wicked, and in desperate need of saving, but that Jesus could wash away her sins and forgive her.\n\u2022 Being exposed to Baptist theology, including King James Only-ism.\n\u2022 As a woman, being told in church that she needed to submit and be subservient to men.\n\u2022 Believing that it was her primary mission to save others from the horrors of hell and feeling guilty for \u0022not doing enough\u0022 to save those who died without Christ.\n\u2022 Telling others that being a Christian is not about a religion, but about a personal and loving relationship with Jesus.\n\u2022 Being taught that doing good works was not to earn favor with the Yahweh character, but to express gratitude to him for salvation.\n\u2022 Delighting to study and memorize large chunks of the Bible.\n\u2022 Being told, upon deconverting, that she never had a real relationship with Jesus.\n\u2022 How deconversion was full of guilt and sadness as she went through the process of reclaiming her identity while at the same time getting extensive backlash from Christians.\n\u2022 Seeing Christians patronize and gaslight her after her deconversion, insisting she was mistaken and predicting that she would come back to Jesus someday.\n\u2022 The feeling of slowly losing her faith, despite trying to hold on to it.\n\u2022 How moving into her own home, away from dysfunction, created a place of emotional and mental safety where she could re-evaluate her worldview, without any external factors pushing her in certain directions, and leaving her with the freedom to figure how who she really wanted to be and what she really believed.\n\u2022 Hearing her own voice and intuition instead of trying to hear supposed voice or leading of the Yahweh and Jesus characters.\n\u2022 How the increase in information, combined with the removal of fear, provided a context for an increase in rethinking her worldview and being a more critical thinking.\n\u2022 Learning to get comfortable with contradicting the Bible and admitting its problems.\nStarting to question the Yahweh/god character, including his supposed goodness.\n\u2022 Being strongly encouraged in Christian purity culture, including ultra-modest clothing in order to not be a stumbling block or cause men to be tempted.\n\u2022 How losing her virginity, in the context of purity culture, was traumatizing, and led to feelings of shame and guilt.\n\u2022 The danger of suppressing your sexuality and the desire for pleasure and connection.\n\u2022 How professional therapy has helped toward healing the religious trauma she endured.\n\u2022 The critical importance of empowering ourselves and reclaiming and owning our thought autonomy.\n\u2022 Acknowledging how hard it is, after deconversion, to shake off the guilt and shame that was so deeply ingrained in us as Christians.\nCelebrating her \u0022apostate anniversary\u0022 when she escaped Christianity.\n\u2022 How Christianity sets up the paradigm that Yahweh will crush you, if necessary, to bring you back to him, and how painful and terrifying situations life led her to wonder if that situation was his way of trying to hurt her as a way of pursuing her.\n\u2022 Being free to craft her own identity and to have the ultimate say over what your beliefs should be and who you need to be.\n\u2022 The importance of being kind to yourself and those around you instead of violent and cruel like the Yahweh character is portrayed to be.\n\u2022 The freedom of losing the afterlife, with the removal of the pressure to think like religious institutions dictate, and instead to live in a way that genuinely reflects our identity and values.\n\u2022 Seeing life become much more precious.\nThe tragic perspective Christians have of wishing for the end of their lives so they can see Jesus.\n\u2022 How learning more about evolution helped her deconversion move forward and pushed her to get more information and credible research.\n\u2022 The importance of allowing yourself to experience emotions, like anger, that we were taught to suppress during our time in Christianity.\n\nMany thanks to Belle for sharing her story!\n\n_______________________________\n\n\nCheck out

      "description": "Today I spoke with Christa, who grew up in a non-denominational Christian church, but eventually deconverted as she saw the toxic beliefs and the mythology that it\u0027s based on.\n\nWe touched on many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 Placing her faith in Jesus as a young child and then rededicating her life to Christ repeatedly to be sure it was genuine.\n\u2022 How children who grow up in a Christian home are effectively taught to think that \u0022god is speaking to you,\u0022 when it\u0027s actually just their own thoughts and emotions.\n\u2022 Being taught that Catholics weren\u0027t really Christians or saved, due to the religious differences, and effectively being taught to see Catholics as having a stigma.\n\u2022 How religious superstition and magic thinking come out in the way Christians talk about symbolism, healings, prophecy.\n\u2022 Being effectively taught that if something good happened in life, it was from Yahweh, and if something bad happened in life, it was from Satan.\n\u2022 Believing that if you wanted something that wasn\u0027t happening, you needed to keep praying more and harder.\n\u2022 Being instilled with a white nationalist perspective on history, during homeschooling.\n\u2022 Being overly sheltered from anything \u0022worldly.\u0022\n\u2022 Being heavily indoctrinated into Christian fundamentalism.\n\u2022 How Christians feel under attack all the time because they cannot handle their kids being exposed to the truth.\n\u2022 Being raised to believe that there were angels and demons all around her at all times, so much that her mind tricked her into thinking she could see demons on the walls and ceiling of her home, but eventually realizing that it was just her imagination.\n\u2022 How the mythology of Christianity instills messages of sin and shame in people and sets them up for lifelong guilt and sadness.\n\u2022 How Christianity labels many childlike behaviors as \u0022sins.\u0022\n\u2022 Being labelled as \u0022rebellious\u0022 for simply questioning the narrative, especially as a woman.\n\u2022 How neurobehavioral disorders, such as ADHD, were not really considered acceptable diagnoses for Christians to consider.\n\u2022 Being taught that you don\u0027t need medicine or counseling -- you just need Jesus and a better understanding the Gospel and your identity in Christ, or to \u0022give it to god\u0022 in some way.\n\u2022 The message to young girls to stay away from boys because \u0022they only want one thing.\u0022\n\u2022 Being taught to not \u0022lust after your brothers in Christ\u0022 and to \u0022protect their eyes and minds\u0022 by dressing modestly.\n\u2022 Seeing homosexual people being shunned by the church.\n\u2022 How Christianity conditions people to see their sexuality as bad, dirty, and deviant, and the ways that this dynamic even affects causes immense issues and suffering for married people.\n\u2022 Never being encouraged to pursue a career or outside job because it was assumed that Christian women should only want to be a stay-at-home-mom.\n\u2022 How fundamentalist Christianity indoctrinates women into patriarchy so intensely that women will actually fight for patriarchy and will tear down women who espouse feminism.\n\u2022 The toxic mix of young people being told that they are sinful, that their bodily desires are sinful, to not do anything sexual, and at the same time teaching women that they are inherently stumbling blocks to the men.\n\u2022 How Christianity encourages you to distance yourself from people who are not \u0022godly.\u0022\n\u2022 How cults use insidious tactics to invite, manipulate, isolate, and control their congregations, starting with love bombing.\n\u2022 Realizing, through comparative mythology, that the Jesus character is not unique among the many dying and rising gods that have been invented throughout history.\n\u2022 Realizing that the Yahweh character was once the husband of the goddess Asherah, and earlier, was the son of Elyon, but that the story has evolved repeatedly, in large part to counter the women\u0027s spiritual and cultural power.\n\u2022 Understanding that our minds can \u0022make\u0022 things seem true to us, even if they are not, especially if we are preconditioned and indoctrinated in that direction.\n\u2022 Realizing, after deconversion, that every time you were praying, you were actually just conferring with yourself.\n\u2022 How deconversion frees you to be the most authentic and best version of yourself possible, once you are free from a mythological worldview.\n\nThanks to Christa for sharing her story!\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n*** Please subscribe to my other channels ***\n(many more channels and videos

      "description": "Today I spoke with Lorena Hieronymus, who grew up in the Christ Church cult in Moscow, Idaho, under Doug Wilson, but ultimately escaped from that group, as well as the broader cult of Christianity.\n\nWe touched on many topics including:\n\n\u2022 How the Christ Church cult aims to take over Moscow, Idaho, and beyond, for their particular brand of Christianity.\n\u2022 Seeing racism woven into the Christ Church culture through being taught that blackness is the \u0022mark of Cain,\u0022 that slavery was a good thing for many slaves, and that white men are in charge.\n\u2022 The dynamic that once you join Christ Church, it\u0027s almost impossible to get out of the cult.\n\u2022 The stigma against anyone who is not part of the Christ Church, even if you are a Christian.\n\u2022 How women in this ultra-misogynistic patriarchal cult are groomed to believe that they should be silent, disempowered domestic servants who are subservient to male leadership.\n\u2022 How Christ Church, and especially Doug Wilson, uses fear as a tactic to brainwash the congregation, especially women.\n\u2022 Being taught as a woman that you should never turn down your husband sexually and that there is no such thing as marital rape because your body belongs to him.\n\u2022 How the Christ Church cult takes away autonomy of body and thought.\n\u2022 How people in Christ Church don\u0027t seem to seriously question Doug Wilson, despite endless red flags.\n\u2022 The danger of having structures of leadership and submission that protect the power of men at the expense of women, especially in cases of abuse.\n\u2022 Being taught that a woman\u0027s body is inherently a stumbling block that causes men to sin.\n\u2022 Being brainwashed to believe that you are worthless and worthy of shame.\n\u2022 How women are treated as property in the Christ Church community, and how a woman gets passed from her father to her husband when she gets married, always remaining under the authority of the head of the household.\n\u2022 Being taught that what matters is not your happiness, but your obedience -- to the Yahweh and Jesus characters, to the church elders, and to your father or husband.\n\u2022 How Doug Wilson intentionally uses nasty, hateful language to trigger those who disagree with him, in order to instill shame and fear in people, especially liberal Christians, feminists, and the LGBTQ community.\n\u2022 How people in Christ Church are shunned and excommunicated if they go against the church authority or culture.\n\u2022 How men strongly benefit from the ultra-patriarchal system of a cult like Christ Church.\n\u2022 Dealing with trauma from growing up in the Christ Church cult, and Christianity in general, but eventually reclaiming her identity, healing, and becoming an advocate for abuse victims.\n\u2022 After deconversion, getting over the fear of hell, moving past the feelings of worthlessness, learning to be truly happy, and choosing the path that she wanted, not one that was dictated to her.\n\u2022 Realizing, during deconstruction, that the New Testament heavily copies from the book of Enoch, many other intertestamental books, and the works of Homer.\n\u2022 Admitting that the Yahweh character is portrayed in the Bible as a severely abusive narcissist.\n\u2022 Choosing the path of courageously speaking up against abuse.\n\u2022 Giving the next generation the gift of autonomy, of both their body and of their thought life and worldview.\n\u2022 Forgiving Christians for the trauma they have inflicted on us, and thriving despite how much they and their mythology have hurt and continue to hurt us and our society.\n\nThanks to Lorena for sharing her story and helping others escape and heal from the abuse of the Christ Church cult and from Christianity.\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nDig deeper:\n\nExamining Doug Wilson and Moscow, Idaho FB group \u0026 IG

      "description": "Today I spoke with Kyle Butler, who grew up in a Christian home and became a pastor for 16 years before critically examining the claims of Christianity, and ultimately deconverting.\n\nAs we talked through his story, we touched on topics like:\n\n\u2022 Feeling the sense of urgency as he reached the age of 13, the age of accountability, to get right with god.\n\u2022 Repeatedly questioning his salvation because he struggled with sin and wondered if he was just temporarily struggling or not actually saved.\n\u2022 How Lordship Salvation teachings ruined his life.\n\u2022 Why the church is so afraid to scrutinize its narratives and to admit they are wrong and don\u0027t work.\n\u2022 Admitting that the Gospel is powerless to change lives.\n\u2022 Hearing people give him prophecies from god about his life and about god\u0027s will for him.\n\u2022 The sense that he had to obey god\u0027s will, or god would force him to obey through humbling hardships -- and the consequences could be very painful.\n\u2022 The bizarre cognitive dissonance in Christianity of a god who hurts and tortures his children and is yet called a loving and good father.\n\u2022 The Christian dynamic of having people become teachers even when they don\u0027t understand the background of the Bible they are teaching.\n\u2022 How the endless versions and varieties of Christianity and the resulting confusion and lack of consensus lead to wondering why that deity would be so confusing, if he were real.\n\u2022 Believing that god was the head of our lives, that our lives were in his hands, that he was in control, and that we need to follow his plan and fully trust him, and that he cannot fail.\n\u2022 How Christianity demands an obsessive, consuming love for Yahweh, Jesus, and the Biblical worldview.\n\u2022 How Christianity is debilitating and punishing to believers, on many levels.\n\u2022 How Christianity is ultimately revealed to be merely another tool to scare, control, and manipulate people.\n\u2022 The message that the divine presence is constantly watching and judging you and can even see your thoughts and intentions.\n\u2022 Realizing that the concept of a loving god cannot be reconciled with the teaching about eternal conscious torment.\n\u2022 How we, when we were Christians, would gaslight ourselves constantly into thinking everything was our fault -- not the fault of god or the Christian machine.\n\u2022 The bizarre Judeo-Christian narrative that the shedding of blood is required for forgiveness to occur, that it pleased god the father to torture his son Jesus, and that he ultimately needs to torture and kill someone -- either Jesus or sinners -- to be appeased.\n\u2022 How the Lord\u0027s Table / Communion is a form of cannibalism, where we symbolically eat the flesh and drink the blood of a dead man.\n\u2022 The importance of not indoctrinating the next generation into religion.\n\u2022 Realizing that every religion has a god or gods, and every religion has a book, and that religion thus nothing more than a man-made structure where everyone is claiming to have the truth.\n\u2022 How religion steals the precious time we have in life.\n\u2022 Finding that you are a better, much happier person after we move on from Christianity.\n\u2022 Being able, after our deconversion, to respect people and treat them with much more dignity than ever could when we were Christians.\n\nMany thanks to Kyle for sharing his story!\n\n_________________________________________\n\nConnect with Kyle!\n\nTiktok @kyle_talks\n\n_________________________________________\n\nMentioned in this video:\n\nDan Barker\u0027s video, \u0022You Don\u0027t Have to Go Down in My Basement\u0022\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=854J4ffKDww\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n*** Please subscribe to my other channels ***\n(many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",

      "description": "Today I spoke with Stacie Grahn, who grew up in a charismatic Christian environment, shifted toward a more Reformed/Calvinistic version of Christianity in adulthood, but eventually deconverted after taking a hard look at the bizarreness of the claims of Christianity.\n\nAs we walked through her story, we touched on topics such as:\n\n\u2022 Re-dedicating her life to Jesus several times to be sure that she was really saved.\n\u2022 The pressure to continually see greater and greater things from the Lord.\n\u2022 Experiencing prophetic dreams where she felt god was speaking to her.\n\u2022 Letting emotions drive your thinking as a Christian.\n\u2022 How it was considered sinful to even entertain the idea of god not being real.\n\u2022 Believing that angels and demons were fighting all around her in the unseen realm and that there were territorial spirits inhabiting certain locations that Christians should avoid or pray against.\n\u2022 The ways that church worship is designed to manipulate the congregation by evoking intense emotions and appealing to people\u0027s hurts and disappointments.\n\u2022 Being terrified as a child thinking about hell and the Devil.\n\u2022 Believing in the Rapture, where Jesus comes to take believers to heaven before the Tribulation, but also recognizing, even as a Christian, that it all sounded really weird.\n\u2022 Constantly trying to figure out what spiritual door she opened to let demonic activity occur in her life.\n\u2022 The dynamic that the people who were more deeply committed to Jesus, the Gospel, and the Kingdom are more \u0022fully done\u0022 with religion when they escape Christianity.\n\u2022 The ways that Christianity suppresses sexual pleasure and eroticism for unmarried people to such an extent that once they finally get married, it\u0027s often very difficult to flip the switch and start enjoying it.\n\u2022 Getting pulled into Calvinism as a theological foundation and worldview and seeing the arrogance it evokes in its followers.\n\u2022 Feeling like the rug has been pulled from under your feet when you start deconstructing.\n\u2022 Making the decision to always let yourself ask the hard questions going forward.\n\u2022 How the ludicrous Christian behavior and attitudes toward Covid, Trump, and Church abuses help us escape and realize the intense \u0022cringe factor\u0022 of Christianity.\n\u2022 Upon deconverting, feeling like you have seen life for the first time -- like you were truly born again (again).\n\u2022 Finding that you are happier than you\u0027ve ever been, after deconversion.\n\u2022 The freedom that comes from realizing that sin is not a thing, and that it\u0027s instead just a made-up construct and fear tactic to keep people mentally enslaved to institutionalized mythology.\n\u2022 Begin told by Christians, after we deconvert, that we have turned to evil and are mocking god.\n\nMany thanks to Stacie for sharing her story and insights!\n\n_________________________________________\n\nConnect with Stacie!\n\n\nTiktok @apostacie\nIG @apostacie \nTwitter @_apostacie\n\nStacie is also a host on Skeptic Haven:\nhttps://youtube.com/c/SkepticHaven\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n*** Please subscribe to my other channels ***\n(many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",

      "description": "Today I spoke with Julie Anne Smith, an investigative blogger covering high-profile clergy sexual misconduct cases.\n\nAs we walked through her story and her investigative reporting journey, we touched on many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 The negative impact of the Christian homeschool movement, where ideologies of patriarchy, courtship, purity culture, and \u0022quiverfull\u0022 (having as many kids as possible) were pervasive and pushed hard among leaders and families.\n\u2022 Being told by Protestants, while she was a Catholic earlier in life, that she was going to hell because she was not truly saved.\n\u2022 Feeling guilty, in light of the Quiverfull movement, at carefully planning the timing each pregnancy, as it\u0027s viewed as not fully trusting god for the timing of pregnancies and large quantity of kids that he wants to bestow.\n\u2022 How the reconstructionist Christian perspective aims to take over the US and the world, in order to establish a theocracy.\n\u2022 How the Reconstructionist, Theonomic, and Patriarchal movements critically depend on daughters being raised to believe in and agree to its fundamentalist philosophies, in order to \u0022outbreed the pagans\u0022 so they can \u0022outvote the pagans\u0022 and take over the culture.\n\u2022 How the cult of Christchurch in Moscow, Idaho, run by Doug Wilson, is trying to take over their town and the nation with their version of Christianity.\n\u2022 How churches have failed women on multiple fronts.\n\u2022 How the worldview of Calvinism creates harshness, rudeness, and pride in its adherents, leading to many Calvinists embracing an extremely hateful and snarky tone, and leading them to act like they think they are right about everything.\n\u2022 How pastors in fundamentalist churches tend to end up on power trips, where their opinion is \u0022the final word.\u0022\n\u2022 The experience of church members shunning you when you leave the church.\n\u2022 How purity culture leads to extreme legalism where you tend to constantly judge others for what they are wearing or how much skin they are showing.\n\u2022 How Bill Gothard and the IBLP group shamed and blamed women, treated them as inherently temptresses, and taught that women are the \u0022deceived\u0022 gender (1 Timothy 2:14).\n\u2022 How ancient Judaism was steeped in the theology that women were bad and seductive because in the mythology of creation Eve invited Adam to sin.\n\u2022 How women in patriarchal churches are required to quietly submit to their husband\u0027s leadership and not challenge his authority.\n\u2022 How patriarchal pastors demonstrate hatred and contempt for women.\n\u2022 How churches, and even journalists, focus their attention and stories on abusers and perpetrators instead of the victims and on how to protect them.\n\u2022 How church leadership typically assumes that people who claim to have been abused by church leaders are probably not telling the truth, in order to protect church leadership and \u0022maintain the peace\u0022 of the church, and how the church then often switches the narrative to blame the victims.\n\u2022 Learning to see red flags and patterns in relationships and spiritual environments in order to have healthy boundaries.\n\u2022 The importance of getting re-grounded in a new community and experiencing the full range of emotions as you grieve and make healthy choices after escaping from abusive situations.\n\u2022 How pastors often prioritize the institution of marriage over the individuals in the marriage, and end up advising people to not divorce, even when marriages are extremely toxic and people are in harm\u0027s way.\n\nMany thanks for Julie Anne for sharing her story and insights!\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nConnect with Julie Anne:\nWebsite:\nhttps://spiritualsoundingboard.com/\n\nFB:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SpiritualSoundingBoard\n\nTwitter\n@DefendTheSheep\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Julie-Anne-Smith-263087791061812\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n*** Please subscribe to my other channels ***\n(many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",

      "description": "**Apologies for the audio issues at the beginning; they die down pretty quickly.\n\nToday I spoke with Untestimony, who grew up as a pastor\u0027s kid in a non-denominational evangelical church, but eventually deconverted after she dug deep into the claims and origins of Christianity.\n\nWe touched on many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 Seeing life as a \u0022rescue operation\u0022 where we are first rescued by Jesus and then we, in turn, help rescue others through the Gospel of Jesus\u0027 death and resurrection on our behalf.\n\u2022 Being taught that non-Christian scientists were not correct purely because of their bias and blinders, and then during deconversion realizing that it\u0027s Christianity that is pushing the bias and blinders.\n\u2022 Growing up believing that babies were born with a sin nature and that they deserved death.\n\u2022 The importance of asking hard questions about your beliefs and worldview.\n\u2022 Feeling like a wolf in sheep\u0027s clothing during the early stages of deconversion, because Christianity teaches that those who walk away are willfully \u0022walking away from god,\u0022 even though all you\u0027re doing is seeking truth more than ever.\n\u2022 Feeling abandoned by god when you are asking for answers and consequently trying to seek him more than ever during the initial stages of deconversion.\n\u2022 How Christians ask for a high standard of evidence for other religions, but then accept an absurdly low standard of evidence for their own.\n\u2022 Begin horrified, on this side of deconversion, at what we used to believe and that we accepted crazy ideas simply because our authority figure at that time told us to.\n\u2022 Growing up thinking that you cannot question the Yahweh character because his ways are far above ours and that we do not understand the true horrors of sin or the splendors of his holiness.\n\u2022 Realizing that when we were reading the Bible, we weren\u0027t reading a book from a god, but a collection of horrific ideas by fallible men describing the literary and cultural evolution of the psychopathic Yahweh demigod character.\n\u2022 Realizing that Judaism and Christianity are based on and heavily borrowing from what we, as Christians, would have called \u0022pagan religions\u0022 and mythology.\n\u2022 The Christian cultural impression that \u0022women want love, and men want respect and sex,\u0022 and the corollary ideas that women are less sexually interested than men and that men are sexually out of control, so a Christian wife\u0027s responsibility is to keep her man satisfied to keep him from being tempted, and if he strays, it\u0027s her fault.\n\u2022 After deconversion, regretting not exploring our own sexuality earlier due to purity culture.\n\u2022 How shame culture leads people to hate themselves and even to harm their own bodies as a result of feeling like a failure due to thinking about sexuality too much and not being focused on Jesus enough.\n\u2022 The ironic ways that modesty culture will sexually charges Christians as they try to balance a pious fa\u00E7ade with repressed sexual pressure.\n\u2022 How church worship music manipulates congregants by making people feel emotionally connected to the Yahweh character.\n\u2022 Acknowledging that Christian missionary work is a form of Western colonization.\n\u2022 How the Christian worldview exudes extreme arrogance as it effectively tells all other worldviews and cultural perspectives to \u0022shut up and listen to us, since we have the truth and you don\u0027t.\u0022\n\u2022 Begin horrified at the Old Testament atrocities, such as genocide, child brides, slavery, stoning, etc.\n\u2022 Feeling like when you are most needing god to show up, there is complete radio silence, and realizing that there is ultimately no difference between a god who does not communicate and a god who does not exist.\n\u2022 Going through the stages of grief after deconversion.\n\u2022 Dealing with the shock of the nastiness and snark of Christians after you deconvert and as you see them treating you like a traitor for leaving Christianity.\n\u2022 Experiencing much more peace after deconversion than we ever had as Christians.\n\nMany thanks to Untestimony for sharing her story

White.\n\u2022 Analyzing Christianity using the outsider test for faith, and realizing that Christianity, just like other religions, evolved out of other earlier religious beliefs and how Christian apologists try in vain to explain away its truly horrific teachings.\n\u2022 Being surprised that there weren\u0027t better answers to his questions than he could find from pastors and theologians.\n\u2022 Seeing that the morality of the Yahweh character vacillates wildly throughout the Bible.\n\u2022 Feeling like he didn\u0027t leave the faith, but, instead, that the faith left him.\n\u2022 Going through the experience of \u0022sinking in the quicksand of disbelief.\u0022\n\u2022 Realizing that childhood indoctrination into Christianity is a form of psychological child abuse.\n\u2022 Seeing the Adam and Eve characters in Genesis as being \u0022framed\u0022 by the Yahweh character.\n\u2022 Concluding that Christianity is just institutionalized bronze-age mythology.\n\u2022 The beauty and joy of living without a mythological worldview.\n\nMany thanks to Kamron for sharing his amazing story and insights!\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nConnect with Kamron!\n\nYouTube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1ybalztjVTy5HVYj-puS0Q\n\nInstagram\n@kbfit2.0\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n*** Please subscribe to my other channels ***\n(many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",

We touched on his story, and then had a lively discussion on several topics, including:\n\n\u2022 Committing as a teenager to full-time ministry while simultaneously repressing homosexuality and trying to \u0022pray the gay away.\u0022\n\u2022 Selling a lot of his possessions to be sold-out to Jesus.\n\u2022 Realizing the powerlessness of the gospel story and the lack of evidence of some kind of \u0022Holy Spirit\u0022 at work to unify Christians.\n\u2022 Observing how the church frequently \u0022shoots its wounded.\u0022\n\u2022 Wanting to believe but not seeing evidence to confirm that belief.\n\u2022 Realizing that any version of Christianity is a cult.\n\u2022 Seeing that Christianity is, in large part, about propaganda, marketing, and gaslighting.\n\u2022 Realizing that the Yahweh character is a psychopathic narcissist.\n\u2022 How religion is a form of patriotism, and a tribalistic way of saying, \u0022I\u0027m better than you.\u0022\n\u2022 Sharing the Gospel and doing street preaching and missions trips to get others saved.\n\u2022 Towing the line, as atheists, between being as graceful as possible, but still firm about how bad the Christian worldview is, and how it is psychologically damaging to children.\n\u2022 Dealing with the bizarre mental gymnastics Christians try to use to justify believing that their god is loving and yet a god of genocide, land theft, slavery, stoning, etc.\n\u2022 How the Christian shame culture psychologically buries people alive and creates a double life for many people.\n\u2022 Understanding spiritual abuse and learning to heal from the overwhelming damage that the Christian worldview creates.\n\nThanks to Brady for sharing his story and insights with us today, and for all the ways he helps the deconstructing and deconverting communities.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nConnect with Brady!\n\nhttp://thelifeafter.org/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/thelifeafterorg\n\nhttps://thelifeafterorg.tumblr.com/\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/show/29nMO8Sx0sxIul6tVKvvxG?si=98c29c271346446b\n\nhttps://twitter.com/thelifeafterorg\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/TheLifeAfterPodcast\n\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/thelifeafterorg/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thelifeafterorg/\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n*** Please subscribe to my other channels ***\n(many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",

      "description": "Today I spoke with Rachel Aschliman, who grew up in the Apostolic Christian Church and in Pentecostal denominations, but ultimately deconverted as Christian truth claims progressively fell apart.\n\nAs we talked through her story, we discussed many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 The ripple effects of the ultra-legalistic Apostolic Christian Church, where men and women sit on separate sides of the church and elders have immense power over the congregation.\n\u2022 Seeing some Christians advise against doctors and medicine, and instead encourage believers to wait on the Yahweh character for healing.\n\u2022 As an 11 year old, dealing with earlier sexual abuse and wanting to die, but accepting the Jesus character as her Savior to take away her sin and the mental anguish of loathing herself.\n\u2022 Growing up \u0022pleading the blood of Jesus\u0022 for protection.\n\u2022 Feeling the pressure to \u0022fulfill the calling\u0022 from the Yahweh character to be a wife and mother, and to have a large family.\n\u2022 The scary dynamic of recognizing that the world was full of demonic activity, and that demons could be overwhelmingly deceptive.\n\u2022 The experience, as a Christian, of having no joy for decades, and how that experience betrays the reality that the Gospel has no power.\n\u2022 Dealing with thoughts like \u0022Why won\u0027t god take away these homosexual desires?\u0022 while trying to repress a same-sex attraction.\n\u2022 Trying to deny one\u0027s sexuality for a season due to believing that being a Christian and being gay were not compatible.\n\u2022 Understanding the psychological and emotional manipulation that churches use to control people -- especially those who are desperate -- and to prime the pump to get them to respond in blind faith and allegiance.\n\u2022 Realizing the Gospels have discrepancies that cannot be harmonized, as well as mythology woven throughout.\n\u2022 The experience of realizing Christianity is just a human-made and human-sustained religion -- not divine at all.\n\u2022 Seeing the culture shift within Christianity to care much less about winning people to the Jesus character and saving them from hell, but instead fighting and attacking unbelievers, and writing them off when they disagree.\n\u2022 Understanding the worldview many Christians have where they think they will be in paradise while non-Christians are tortured forever ... and realizing that most Christians agree with the Yahweh character on that fate of torment for unbelievers.\n\u2022 After deconversion, dealing with the loss of the afterlife, but also appreciating our finite lives much more as a result.\n\u2022 Realizing that the Christian worldview, which previously seemed so solid, had been extremely fragile the whole time and easily crumbles when people understand the origins of Christianity and its philosophical absurdities.\n\u2022 Learning to accept yourself and your desires as you celebrate your sexuality and embrace eroticism.\n\u2022 Realizing that in the Garden of Eden story, it appears that the Yahweh character was actually the liar, and the Serpent character was telling the truth.\n\u2022 The need to protect children from the psychological child abuse that is inherent in all forms of Christianity.\n\nMany thanks to Rachel for sharing her story and insights with us!\n\n_________________________________________\n\nRachel\u0027s YouTube page:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-xGcsT611s3eaGSd9moFQ/videos\n\n_________________________________________\n\nMentioned in this video:\n\nMythVision\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/MythVisionPodcast\n\nDragons in Genesis\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/DragonsinGenesisPodcast/videos\n\nThe Vridar blog\nhttps://vridar.org/\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n*** Please subscribe to my other channels ***\n(many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",

      "description": "Today I spoke with Sacha D\u0027Souza, who grew up as a Jehovah\u0027s Witness, but eventually deconverted as he unraveled its origins and the discrepancies and fallacies of the Biblical worldview.\n\nAs we walked through his story, we touched on many topics, such as:\n\n\u2022 How the \u0022Christ-like\u0022 love of Christians is often very conditional on your agreeing with their beliefs and worldview, and how their fa\u00E7ade of love quickly turns to hate when you ask too many questions or dissent.\n\u2022 The experience of having one very religious parent, while the other parent just goes along with it.\n\u2022 Seeing Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses pray for the imminent destruction of all unbelievers, even their own of loved ones.\n\u2022 The all-compassing commitment to Jehovah and to living for him that is expected of Witnesses, even from a very young age.\n\u2022 The oppressive outcome of total shunning and ostracization that occurs after someone is baptized as a Witness but then stops believing or leaves the church.\n\u2022 The dark message that the Tribulation and Armageddon will start very soon, when Jehovah will destroy all disbelievers.\n\u2022 The intense pressure on Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses to not displease Jehovah or to ever fall away.\n\u2022 The dynamic that the more educated you get, the more holes appear in religion, so religions shelter their people from the truth and discourage higher education because they might be encouraged to analytically examine their faith claims.\n\u2022 Thinking there is a cosmic dualistic fight of good vs. evil constantly going on in the universe, the culture, and in our minds.\n\u2022 How religions, especially high-control cults, prey on the young and malleable and abuse their vulnerability, blind trust, and lack of critical opposing information.\n\u2022 The intense, regulated ministry preparation that occurs at Bethel.\n\u2022 How many Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses fail to plan much for the future because they are confident Jesus will return \u0022any day now.\u0022\n\u2022 The importance in religion to never truly question \u0022god,\u0022 but to instead always trust and obey, even when the deity\u0027s character or commands don\u0027t make sense or appear inappropriate or cruel.\n\u2022 Realizing that the pressure to conform leads people to \u0022live the part\u0022 even if they don\u0027t truly believe or care to investigate whether the religious claims are true.\n\u2022 Admitting that the Yahweh character would not be \u0022good\u0022 if he were real.\n\u2022 The importance of treading carefully through deconversion when you are in a marriage and you are deconverting, but your spouse has not yet even started deconstructing or asking critical questions about the religion.\n\u2022 Being sensitive to those who are still in the \u0022Bible prison,\u0022 and to how they might find out about our deconversions after we\u0027ve had lots of time to process our questions and journey, while it\u0027s all brand new to them.\n\u2022 How that the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses organization has whitewashed its own history, including the ways their teachings have changed over the decades.\n\u2022 The horrific crime coverups in the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses church, and other church denominations, which betray the utter lack of power in the Gospel, and of our need to work to free children from the psychological child abuse of mythological worldviews and of telling them they are wicked in Jehovah\u0027s sight and in need of blood magic to be at peace with him.\n\u2022 How the organization \u0022Recovering From Religion\u0022 helps those who are deconstructing and deconverting, meeting people right where they are.\n\nMany thanks to Sacha for sharing his amazing journey out of religion and into freedom!\n\n_________________________\n\nMy earlier interview with Sherri D\u0027Souza:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yE_bNR3ULXk\n\n________________________________\n\nRecovering from Religion\nhttps://www.recoveringfromreligion.org/\n\n______________________________________\n\nLloyd Evan\u0027s YouTube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/LloydEvans\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n*** Please subscribe to my other channels ***\n(many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",

      "description": "Today I spoke with Nancy O\u0027Brien Simpson, who grew up believing in Jesus, became the women\u0027s columnist for Jerry Falwell\u0027s Moral Majority, and was a co-founder of the Jericho Project, a pro-life group in Cincinnati.  Nancy was a fervent evangelical Christian until the idea of a loving god eternally tormenting his children began to invade her faith and trouble her worldview, and she eventually deconverted.\n\nAs we talked through her story, we touched on many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 Growing up with an extreme fear of hell.\n\u2022 The experience of being \u0022born again\u0022 and being \u0022on fire for Jesus.\u0022\n\u2022 Realizing the horrors of external conscious torment.\n\u2022 How Christians are indoctrinated to not ultimately question the Yahweh character, and whether the narrative is actually real.\n\u2022 Seeing much more love from unbelievers, and hatred from Christians.\n\u2022 How the Yahweh character is portrayed in the Bible as being on a constant ego-trip, demanding total and unending worship to address his insecurity, including psychopathic requests \n\u2022 How the Yahweh character is a brutal god of infanticide, genocide, and human sacrifice, stoning your children to death, etc.\n\u2022 The fact that Passover is a celebration of killing children.\n\u2022 Realizing, from a Trinitarian perspective, that Jesus commanded the same brutal violence as Yahweh, because he is equated to Yahweh.\n\u2022 Realizing that if Yahweh were real, he would have foreseen every single brutality, abuse, and slaughter that would ever occur, and he could have stopped it, but chose not to, and arguably is ultimately behind it (\u201CI form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.\u201D)\n\u2022 How basic human love and forgiveness far exceeds the hatefulness and sadistic nature of the Yahweh character.\n\u2022 The ways that Christianity darkens the human mind into a psychopathic worldview.\n\u2022 Realizing that many Christians truly believe that even their own children deserve eternal conscious torment if they reject the Gospel.\n\u2022 If you believe monstrous ideas long enough, you become a monster.\n\u2022 The bizarre description of the Yahweh character delighting in the aroma of burning flesh.\n\u2022 The joy and delight of escaping Christianity.\n\nMany thanks to Nancy for sharing her story and insights!\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n*** Please subscribe to my other channels ***\n(many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",

      "title": "Understanding how CHRONOLOGICAL DISLOCATION conceals HISTORICAL TRUTH - Ralph Ellis",
      "description": "Today I was honored to speak again with Ralph Ellis, who shared many critical insights regarding the origins of Judaism and Christianity. \n\nAs we moved through our discussion, we touched on:\n\n\u2022 How the Bible, to some extent, describes legitimate history, but changes names and merges different stories to protect certain people at that time, to sell the persecution narrative, to unify the people through foundation stories, to shape the details to fit their evolving theology, and as propaganda.\n\u2022 How history gets written by the victors.\n\u2022 The Hyksos / Shepherd Kings (Israelite) exodus from Egypt (c. 1580 BC)\n\u2022 The small exodus of the Amana kings (Akhenaten/Nefertiti (c. 1320 BC)\n\u2022 How the characteristics, names, city nickname, temple name, family, and companions of Paseba-kha-en-nuit sound just like those of King David.\n\u2022 The hidden history of Solomon (Sheshonq) and the United Monarchy (c. 900 BC).\n\u2022 The fascinating way that the Bible rewrites the true story of what happened between David, Bathsheba, Solomon, and the Queen of Sheba (who was viewed as an incarnation of Isis).\n\u2022 How the \u0022United Monarchy\u0022 of Israel as described in the Old Testament appears to have been actually been located not in Jerusalem (Zion), but in Tanis (Zoan), Northern Egypt.\n\u2022 The connection between the Aramaic and Egyptian language.\n\u2022 How Yahweh was originally a moon god (\u0022Yah\u0022 in Egyptian means \u0022moon\u0022), and Elohim was originally a sun god, showing early Egyptian / Jewish dualism.  Other names of the Jewish god were of Egyptian origin as well, with connections such as Adon/Aten, Shaddai (the storm god) / Seth -- who became Satan, the god of storms.\n\u2022 How this understanding helps us see that the ancient Israelites were actually still Egyptians, even as late as the 900s BC.\n\u2022 How the Jewish religious leaders crafted their stories during the Babylonian exile and crafted their new monotheistic religion, and \n\u2022 The overwhelming evidence that the Great Pyramid of Egypt is Mount Sinai of the Old Testament stories.\n\u2022 How people and events have been repeatedly hidden from history and then reshaped to tell a different version of history than actually happened.\n\u2022 The esoteric and astrotheological background to the story of the feeding of the 5,000 by the Jesus character.\n\u2022 The background behind Mithraism and how it relates to the Jesus story.\n\u2022 Understanding that Christianity began in Edessa, not Jerusalem.\n\u2022 How scholars are often viewing these topics from a perspective of ignorance, as they show that they are unwilling to actually engage with the historical facts, in order to maintain the status quo.\n\u2022 And many other topics and insights.\n\nThanks again to Ralph for the many ways he continues to share crucial historical connections and insights.\n\n_____________________________\n\nRalph\u0027s website\nhttp://edfu-books.uk/\n\nRalph\u0027s books on Amazon\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Ralph-Ellis/e/B0034PJHIE\n\nRalph\u0027s YouTube channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/ralphellis\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ralph.ellis.144\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n*** Please subscribe to my other channels ***\n(many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",

      "description": "Today I spoke with Anna Schroeder, who grew up in New Zealand in a strict cult called The Evangelistic Church of Christ, before she dug deep into the claims of the Bible, and ultimately deconverted.\n\nAs we walked through her story, we talked about:\n\n\u2022 Growing up with extremely strict rules that were used by the cult to control every area of the lives of the congregation, even down to the color and pattern of their clothing.\n\u2022 How the church put extreme restrictions on what people could read and with whom they could associate, and harshly reprimanded those who did not fully comply.\n\u2022 The gender roles that included the rule that women could not work outside the home and could not been seen outside during pregnancy.\n\u2022 How the cult focused on various parts of the Bible at various times, then moved later on to another focus, forcing the congregation to shift in order to stay on track with whatever the men in leadership felt convicted of at that time.\n\u2022 How the elders dictated who could get married, when they could get married, and even what clothes they had to wear during the wedding.\n\u2022 The practice of Excommunication, where the church completely shuns people, even close family members.\n\u2022 How the church leaders acted like the \u0022voice of god\u0022 and demanded total obedience.\n\u2022 Believing that the Bible was inspired by god and therefore had no errors.\n\u2022 How fear of the end times and of the supernatural world dominates the Christian worldview.\n\u2022 As a Christian, dealing with the reality that others would someday burn forever in hell, and how that leads to evangelism, to help people escape the coming torment--and how critical it became to ignore or try to forget that our loved ones would be tortured forever once they died.\n\u2022 How the church\u0027s position against homosexuality helps open our eyes to the dark side of the church.\n\u2022 How time away from the church can help people to lose their blinders and start to use their critical thinking for the first time.\n\u2022 The significant effects of religious trauma on our minds.\n\u2022 Realizing that when we were Christians, we had set ourselves up as judges over everyone else, and how freeing it is to just enjoy getting to know people, without constantly trying to access whether they are \u0022right with god\u0022 and whether we need to \u0022share the gospel\u0022 with them.\n\u2022 The joy of leaving religion, and feeling the overwhelming sense of peace.\n\u2022 Realizing how precious our short time on life is, especially once we realize there\u0027s probably no afterlife.\n\u2022 Struggling with the motives of Christians, who often befriend people not because they actually want to be their friends, but to share the Gospel and have non-believers observe their lives so that they can \u0022shine\u0022 the love of Jesus to them, and ultimately be able to list them, like a trophy, as someone they converted and \u0022saved.\u0022\n\u2022 The beauty of being able to learn from people with a different worldview and different life experiences, and of giving up the mentality that we are the teachers, and that non-Christians just need to listen to us.\n\u2022 The daunting task of reshaping our worldviews and dealing with the trauma that the Christian worldview inflicted on us.\n\u2022 How Christianity is a prison for the mind.\n\nThanks to Anna for sharing her story, and for demonstrating the bravery,  strength, and intellectual honesty needed to deconvert from the Christian worldview.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nMentioned in this interview:\n\nThe Liturgists podcast\nhttps://theliturgists.com/podcast/\n\nMythVision\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/MythVisionPodcast/videos\n\nDragons in Genesis\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/DragonsinGenesisPodcast/videos\n\nThe Vridar blog\nhttps://vridar.org/\n\nRecovering from Religion\nhttps://www.recoveringfromreligion.org/\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n*** Please subscribe to my other channels ***\n(many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",

      "description": "Today I spoke with Lydie Bousch, who grew up in France in an Evangelical Christian home, in the midst of cultural Catholicism, but who eventually deconverted as she investigated the mythology behind the claims of the Bible.\n\nAs we talked through her story, we touched on many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 The experience of sensing the Yahweh (god) character speaking to her as a small child.\n\u2022 Growing up believing that we are wretched sinners, doomed to hell, apart from the blood of the Jesus character.\n\u2022 Believing that the Bible was the inerrant, inspired message from Yahweh.\n\u2022 Believing that Yahweh is in control, and that anything that seemed confusing to us about his character or plan was just part of the mystery of life, that he would provide the answers someday, and that we were called to trust him.\n\u2022 Fantasizing about what happens after we die, when we see Yahweh face to face and understand \u0022ultimate reality\u0022 better than ever before.\n\u2022 Being terrified of unsaved family and friends going to hell because they did not believe in Jesus.\n\u2022 Being indoctrinated into the thought habit of completely justifying the Yahweh character, no matter how bizarre or nasty he is described in the Bible.\n\u2022 Believing that the Jesus character was coming back at any moment.\n\u2022 How the Bible portrays god as being extremely unforgiving after each person\u0027s life is over.\n\u2022 How the church clearly defines women\u0027s roles, in line with a patriarchal mindset.\n\u2022 The ways that purity culture negatively affects people, including how it creates extensive shame and induces body images issues.\n\u2022 How the American political scene of the last few years prompted serious questions about what Christianity means and what Christians stand for in our culture.\n\u2022 The horrific notion of Christian parents worshipping Yahweh in heaven while their unbelieving children are being tortured in hell forever.\n\u2022 The effect of realizing the origin and evolution of the Yahweh character, as originally a son of Elyon and Asherah, and then merging with Elyon--and thus having Asherah as his wife--and later having the Asherah character entirely removed from the pantheon, to ensure male dominance.\n\u2022 Dealing with the finality of life after you deconvert and realize there is likely no afterlife.\n\u2022 How the deconversion process feels like becoming an orphan.\n\u2022 Realizing that human society has been duping itself for thousands of years.\n\u2022 Dealing with the cognitive dissonance and intentional ignorance of Christians.\n\u2022 The beauty of leaving Christianity and beginning the human journey free from the shackles of mythology.\n\nMany thanks to Lydie for sharing her story and her infectious joy and passion for the beauty of life.\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n*** Please subscribe to my other channels ***\n(many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",

      "description": "Today I spoke with Philip Yancey, bestselling Christian author, regarding his faith journey.  We also dug into some of the reasons that so many Christians are deconverting.\n\nThroughout our discussion, we touched on many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 His newly released memoir, Where the Light Fell, and some of the highlights of his life.\n\u2022 The story of his father passing away from polio when Philip was just 13 months old, in the context of Christians insisting that he would be healed.\n\u2022 Growing up in a fundamentalist Christian environment in the South, where racism and the \u0022curse of Ham\u0022 was preached.\n\u2022 Thinking through the perspective of the Yahweh (god) character being portrayed as a \u0022killjoy.\u0022\n\u2022 The mechanisms that the church has often used to manipulate, control, and instill fear in believers.\n\u2022 Realizing that the church had told him massive lies about crucial topics.\n\u2022 How Philip starts with his conception of god from what he learns from jesus. \n\n[Note: I, Tim, see this as Philip\u0027s way of dealing with the Yahweh character\u0027s psychotic and brutal words and actions in the Old Testament, which I had just mentioned in detail and which Philip was directly responding to.  Philip had agreed that he was concerned about these actions by Yahweh, and went on to say that \u0022there are only two ways I can live with that.\u0022  He first talks about how we humans are like ants to Yahweh, and then talks about seeing \u0022especially the Old Testament as a very slanted human version of what took place, kind of like the propaganda that follows every war.\u0022\n\nThe Yahweh character\u0027s actions and commands in the Old Testament explicitly and repeatedly include: genocide, ethnic cleansing, land theft, slavery, kidnapping and child brides, beating of slaves, genital mutilation, priest-administered abortions via magic dust water, virginity checks, forced marriages, paying off rape with a few shekels, misogyny and sexism, tribalism, stoning gay people, stoning non-virgins, stoning people who worked on the Sabbath, etc., while encouraging people to not eat shellfish and to not mix two kinds of fabric, and telling his people that if they loved and obeyed him, he would bless them, but if they chose not to, he would curse and destroy them.]\n\n\u2022 How the Greek epics and Greek mythology are intricately woven throughout the the Gospels, as well as the hundreds of quotes and references in the New Testament that are taken from non-canonical books, Greek philosophers, and Greco-Roman mystery cults that most Christians are completely unaware of.\n\u2022 The bizarreness of the Biblical teachings on hell, where the Yahweh character insists that people have forgiving hearts, but who then refuses to ever forgive again after people die, and instead tortures those who did not love him.\n\n*** AFTER our interview in the first hour, I took the second hour to do a response video.\n\nThanks to Philip for sharing part of his story as well as his insights with us today!   I hope to touch base again and take the conversation to a much deeper level.\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nWant to learn more about the mythology in the New Testament?\n\nBooks by Dr. Dennis MacDonald:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/s?k=dennis\u002Bmacdonald\n\nBooks by Dr. Robert Price:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Robert-M-Price/e/B001JPBXS8/\n\nBooks by David Fitzgerald:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/David-Fitzgerald/e/B004ASD9M4\n\nBooks by Richard Carrier:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Richard-Carrier/e/B001K8LYEM\n\nBooks by Earl Doherty:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Earl-Doherty/e/B00MMKLHL2\n\nThe Vridar blog:\nhttps://vridar.org/\n\nMythVision\u0027s YT page:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/MythVisionPodcast\n... and this video in particular is a good place to start:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tozott4Q5ok\n\nDragons in Genesis:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/DragonsinGenesisPodcast\n\nhttp://www.earlychristianwritings.com/\n\nhttps://www.pseudepigrapha.com/\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      https://paypal.me/harmonicatheist\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\n\nThe more support I receive, the sooner I can do this full time!\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nConnect with Philip:\n\nWEBSITE:  www.philipyancey.com\nFACEBOOK:  www.facebook.com/PhilipYancey\nNewest book:  https://bit.ly/PYwebWTLF\nMonthly blog:  https://bit.ly/PhilipYanceyBlog",

We chatted about what it was like growing up without religion, and why he\u0027s become passionate about helping others to escape the prison of mythology.\n\nAs we talked through his story, we talked about:\n\n\u2022 The bizarre Gospel message that the Yahweh character is basically saying to the world, \u0022I\u0027m going to kill myself to appease myself because I created you flawed in the first place.\u0022\n\u2022 Acknowledging that there is zero evidence for the Bible\u0027s message being true.\n\u2022 How the Yahweh character is almost always speaking to men, and almost always speaking to men in the middle east.\n\u2022 The major difference it makes to have a science-based education, free from superstition.\n\u2022 The origins of the New Testament, and how most Christians have no idea where their Bible and its stories come from.\n\u2022 How the historical truth of Jesus\u0027 life, activities, or teaching is entirely obscured by the legends and mythologies added to his story.\n\u2022 The ways that the Christian worldview, when put through a rigorous test, falls apart -- across the board.\n\u2022 The importance of not taking someone else\u0027s \u0022word for it\u0022 that the Bible is from a god named Yahweh.\n\u2022 How Christianity is an amalgamation of various dying and rising god stories, mystery cult teachings, mythologies, and philosophies.\n\u2022 The sad and horrifying dynamics of childhood indoctrination into religion.\n\u2022 How religion acts like an addiction, and how hard it is for people to escape.\n\u2022 The idea that there is no ultimate purpose in life, because there is no designer and no design -- leaving us free to define our own purpose.\n\u2022 The importance of doing our part to end the mystery cult called Christianity.\n\u2022 The wonderful privilege of having a secular family, free of religion and superstition.\n\u2022 Dealing with the fear of death as we acknowledge that there is probably no afterlife.\n\u2022 The beauty of using your imagination to make the world a better place, instead of using your mental energy for mythology.\n\nThanks to Chip for sharing his story and insights!\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n*** Please subscribe to my other channels ***\n(many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",

As she investigated the claims of Christianity, she realized it was mythology, and deconverted.\n\nAs we walked through her story, we touched on topics such as:\n\n\u2022 Growing up exposed to Catholic doctrine and culture, including the excitement over seeing a new Pope selected.\n\u2022 How Judaism and Christianity originally had a very strong \u0022feminine divine\u0022 aspect.\n\u2022 Being sheltered and insulated from other belief systems.\n\u2022 Grieving, as a Christian, over the loss of people who went to hell due to not believing in Jesus.\n\u2022 Being told to believe that the torture of hell was part of the Yahweh character\u0027s goodness, and that if we could understand sin and holiness the way he does, we would agree with him that eternal conscious torment was the appropriate punishment for unbelievers and sinners.\n\u2022 How the Pope is seen as \u0022the voice of god\u0022 on earth.\n\u2022 The ways that the Catholic Church tries to explain away the bad and scientifically unsound stories in the Bible by claiming those parts are just allegories.\n\u2022 Realizing the ways that Mother Teresa mistreated and helped oppress the poor.\n\u2022 Thinking through teachings related to the end of life and the afterlife, such as: limbo, purgatory, confession, and last rites.\n\u2022 Never feeling personally close to the Yahweh character, despite praying and going to church a lot.\n\u2022 How the church is not a place of grace, despite its claims, but a bastion of hate and self-protection that we need to warn other people about.\n\u2022 How learning details about the history of religion helps us to deconvert.\n\u2022 The experience of asking ourselves for the first time, \u0022What if Christianity is simply not true?\u0022\n\u2022 Choosing to not let stories of a mythological deity hurt us ever again.\n\u2022 The beauty and importance of raising kids without religion and mythology.\n\u2022 The process of reclaiming your identity as you recover from religion.\n\u2022 Learning to forgive yourself for doing the best you could with the limited information you used to have while you were stuck in Christianity.\n\u2022 Making your life the best you can, in light of each of us having only one life and limited years, and doing our best to leave this world better than we found it.\n\nThanks to Amy for sharing her story and insights with us!\n\n_________________________________________\n\nConnect with Amy:\n\nhttps://nonelife.org/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/NoneLife7\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n*** Please subscribe to my other channels ***\n(many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",

      "title": "Christianity is an irrational system of conformity, wishful thinking, and self-deception - Zach Doty",
      "description": "Today I spoke with Zach Doty, who grew up in Pentecostal and Foursquare churches, and later moved toward a Calvinistic perspective, before deconstructing his faith and realizing the irrationality of the Christianity worldview, and ultimately deconverting.\n\nAs we went through his story, we touched on topics such as:\n\n\u2022 Understanding that truth is worth having, and therefore worth the pursuit, even if the journey is difficult.\n\u2022 Admitting the conflicting motivations that override our search for truth.\n\u2022 The experience of memorizing the Bible and passing out gospel tracts door to door.\n\u2022 Moving from an Arminian perspective into a Calvinistic one, to more seriously honor the New Testament theology of election and sovereignty.\n\u2022 Believing, as Christians, that people were inherently and completely wicked, at enmity with the Yahweh character, incapable of reaching out to him, spiritually dead, and having nothing good to offer him.\n\u2022 Reveling in how the Yahweh character, in his mercy, chose to redeem his elect, of his own will and for his glory.\n\u2022 Looking for \u0022fruit\u0022 in our own lives and others, to have assurance that the Jesus character is living in us.\n\u2022 Believing, as a Christian, that the world was 6,000 years old and even that the universe was geocentric.\n\u2022 Being unwilling, as a Christian, to accept any scientific evidence that contradicted the Bible.\n\u2022 Realizing, during deconstruction, that we had been severely duped by Christian apologist con-artists.\n\u2022 Starting over as an adult, learning real science for the first time, after growing up in Christianity and its pseudo-science.\n\u2022 The harrowing experience of seeing your epistemology crumble in front of you during deconstruction.\n\u2022 Realizing that religion is the epitome of a selfish and anthropomorphic worldview, where the Yahweh character is orchestrating the gospel and all of history for you, so you can be part of his bride.\n\u2022 Realizing we were callous to and even supporting the eternal conscious torment and suffering of the reprobate, in hell, because their torture was deserved and brought glory to Yahweh.\n\u2022 Taking pride, as Christians, in ignorance and closed-mindedness, because we were part of the \u0022base\u0022 things of the world, the clay that Yahweh chose to make into vessels of glory.\n\u2022 How we go through life with an assumption that we are mostly rational in our worldview, even if we have a few ideas to tweak, rather than admit that we may be profoundly wrong about the most critical parts of our beliefs.\n\u2022 The overwhelming power that our need for conformity has over us, especially in the areas of worldview and beliefs.\n\u2022 The importance of being willing to update our worldview based on new information.\n\u2022 Realizing that our intuitions are usually wrong, and that we need to question our assumptions and begin to apply the scientific method to our worldview, in our efforts to remove bad ideas and to search for the truth.\n\u2022 The crucial importance of doubting claims, especially extraordinary ones that have no evidence, instead of blindly believing them.\n\u2022 Admitting the role of wishful thinking and self-deception in our belief systems, especially when most of our loved ones and teachers all believe the same thing.\n\u2022 How Christianity is like an evolved virus of parasitic ideas that infects our minds, in order to exploit our agency and biases, and that it is focused on its own self-interests and survival, not on truth or on our best interest.\n\u2022 Understanding that the Bible is not monolithic, but that it was written by many men over many centuries, with competing, evolving, and incompatible ideas.\n\u2022 The beauty of having truth as your North Star, versus conformity to an ancient, primitive text, which just leads to unending cognitive dissonance.\n\u2022 The path to developing and using tools of truth.\n\nThanks to Zach for sharing his amazing journey out of the mythology of Christianity and into rationality and freedom!\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nZach\u0027s YT channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/ZachDoty0/videos\n\nZach\u0027s website\nhttps://zachdoty.com/\n\nZach\u0027s FB

      "description": "* Apologies for the audio/noise issues on my side.\n\nToday I spoke with Erika Sams, who grew up in a very strict religious environment before unraveling the claims of Christianity and ultimately deconverting.\n\nWe touched on various topics, including:\n\n\u2022 A woman being under a man\u0027s authority her whole life: under her father until she is transferred to her husband\u0027s authority, in order to obey the Biblical authority / obedience structure of god / Jesus / men / women / children.\n\u2022 Being told entire life what your identity and purpose was -- to love and serve Jesus and bring people into the kingdom.\n\u2022 The fear of the possibility of not being one of the elect, and thus being in danger of hell.\n\u2022 Being taught that sexual attraction was wrong and \u0022lust,\u0022 so that even a basic interest in someone else feels like you\u0027re offending god and sinning against your future spouse.\n\u2022 How Christianity teaches women to be responsible for safeguarding men\u0027s purity by being ultra modest.\n\u2022 How modesty culture leads women with curves to want to hide their curves.\n\u2022 The importance of saving yourself for one person in marriage, including in your thought life.\n\u2022 Using a promise ring as a vow to god and your father that you will keep yourself pure until you swap it for the wedding ring.\n\u2022 How human value -- especially for women -- gets tied up entirely in virginity and purity, and the danger of being shamefully labeled \u0022used goods\u0022 if you\u0027ve gone \u0022too far.\u0022\n\u2022 How Christianity leads people to have a double life as they try to maintain their sexual thoughts and their outward fa\u00E7ade of Christian purity.\n\u2022 For those who have done anything of a sexual nature, trying to determine how worthless and stained they should feel as they work through repentance.\n\u2022 Being told sex outside of marriage invites demons into our lives.\n\u2022 The ways that the Yahweh character ends up being like a psycho as he proclaims \u0022You are worthless but I love you, but if you don\u0027t do things my way, I\u0027ll blast you!\u0022\n\u2022 The Christian dynamic of keeping you perpetually \u0022broken and needy.\u0022\n\u2022 How purity culture tells you to not even pleasure your own body.\n\u2022 How the message of a literal hell terrifies Christians who are afraid for their loved ones who they believe will be tortured forever.\n\u2022 Repeatedly asking Jesus to save us, to be sure it was real, since hell is at stake.\n\u2022 How Christians hurt so many communities by writing people off as \u0022lost causes\u0022 according to their theology.\n\u2022 The nonstop fear of being \u0022left behind.\u0022\n\u2022 The unending damage that can be done by extremist parents to their children.\n\u2022 The overwhelming arrogance that the Christian worldview creates in its adherents.\n\u2022 The constant Christian personal experience conundrum of wondering if \u0022the voice of god\u0022 is actually god, our own self-consciousness/wishful thinking, or the devil.\n\u2022 The nonstop endeavor to figure out god\u0027s elusive will, and working through the resulting instability when his will seemed crystal clear, and then the door closes.\n\u2022 Realizing the extreme manipulation of church worship, where they repeatedly get you to sing about being worthless and broken without the Jesus character.\n\u2022 How the church commits psychological child abuse by preying on young people and brainwashing them into thinking they are wicked and that the Jesus character\u0027s torture was necessary because of how bad they are.\n\u2022 The importance of having a psychological \u0022funeral\u0022 to grieve your time in Christianity.\n\u2022 The dynamic of \u0022leaving the door open a little bit\u0022 at the end of your time in Christianity, out of fear that you might be wrong about Yahweh being real and over fear of death.\n\u2022 Extreme fear of hell.\n\u2022 The idea that Yahweh is so mad at his own creation that he\u0027s going to torture it, instead of just not create it in the first place or just forgive.\n\u2022 The importance of wanting the truth more than your tradition.\n\u2022 The way Christianity wraps your worldview entirely in the Yahweh character, and how hard it is to start over and reclaim your identity after deconversion.\u2022 How comparative mythology and religion helps us to see through Christianity\u0027s claims.\n\u2022 Admitting to ourselves that if we had been born in another time and place, we would very likely have wholeheartedly believed something entirely different.\n\u2022 Realizing the bizarreness of believing in canonicity, once you realize what was actually happening in that process.\n\u2022 How the church shelters you from alternative perspectives and solid information about the origins of Christianity.\n\nMany thanks to Erika for sharing her

      "title": "The Resurrection accounts are FALSE and the Gospels are NOT to be trusted - Jonathan MS Pearce",
      "description": "Today I spoke with author Jonathan MS Pearce again about the importance of understanding that the Resurrection accounts are false and that the Gospels are not to be trusted as history.\n\nAs we dove into his book, \u0022The Resurrection: A Critical Examination of the Easter Story,\u0022 we touched on many intriguing topics, including:\n\n\u2022 The idea that the writers of the Bible are writing theology, not history.\n\u2022 How Paul is our earliest source for information about Jesus, and that the evidence Paul provides is extremely poor.\n\u2022 How Jesus began as an exalted prophet and slowly became legendized and mythologized with stories borrowed from other stories and mystery religions.\n\u2022 The dynamic that false and even horrific ideas can seem entirely legitimate and normal to people if they are introduced early in life and reinforced consistently.\n\u2022 When you expect evidence, and there is none, it is evidence that the claim is false.\n\u2022 That Paul is silent about the empty tomb because it hadn\u0027t been invented yet.\n\u2022 How the Gospels progressively embellish the narrative -- thus why Paul, and then later on the Gospel of Mark, have an no resurrection story.\n\u2022 How Paul does not appear to have believed in a physical resurrection.\n\u2022 How it is likely that Jewish authorities began arguing that Jesus\u0027 body was stolen, explaining why Matthew adds an empty tomb story.\n\u2022 The fact that there are dozens of other Gospels telling very different and incompatible stories, and how church councils, over many generations, arbitrarily picked the Gospels and other books they wanted to go into the canon.\n\u2022 How the characters in the New Testament don\u0027t appear to have wanted to verify extreme claims, and if the characters had been real (instead of just literary devices), they would have had little or no way to verify the claims, and the earliest audiences that read the Gospels for the first time had no way to fact check.\n\u2022 Once you realize the Gospels are not historical, you realize there\u0027s no reason to hang your theology or truth claims on it anymore.\n\u2022 How the wild embellishment of the Trial and Crucifixion make it easy to see that it\u0027s contrived and interpolated.\n\u2022 How the Jesus character is used as a replacement for the Paschal lamb in the Gospel stories.\n\u2022 How hyper-literalism keeps people from reading the Bible for what the original authors actually intended and from seeing the theological ploys and naming techniques they used.\n\u2022 How Midrash, Pesher, and Mimesis techniques were used in the Gospels to retell older Old Testament and Greek and Roman epic stories to make them more valuable for the new audience.\n\u2022 The dynamics around visions and hallucinations, and the strange contrast between Christians who would question people\u0027s current-day claims of visions, and yet do not question the claims of the New

      "description": "Today I spoke with Deborah Grace, who grew up in an evangelical church environment and then got involved with the Hebrew Roots movement, before ultimately facing the discrepancies of the Bible and its origins, which led her to deconvert from Christianity.\n\nAs we talked through her story and her recent book, Crucifying the Bible, we touched on many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 Being concerned about the validity of our earlier professions of faith, so much that we felt the need to re-confess our faith in the Jesus character and even to get re-baptized, repeatedly, because there is so much at stake.\n\u2022 How our trust of our parents -- especially if they are exceptionally honest and good people -- leads us to believe that their worldview must be accurate.\n\u2022 How the Christian worldview becomes pervasive and all-encompassing.\n\u2022 The Christian push to outbreed the pagans through a Quiverfull mentality.\n\u2022 The selective supremacy of certain people in the Bible and Christendom.\n\u2022 How Christianity sets you up to never remotely question the ultimate truth of that worldview.\n\u2022 The bizarre dynamic of thinking the Yahweh character is not a god of confusion, and that the holy spirit character is leading people into truth, and yet there are endless interpretations of every single verse and theological point.\n\u2022 How the end times and Apocalypse/Rapture/Tribulation concepts are used to scare people into believing, and how those fear tactics often create immense trauma in people.\n\u2022 The strange experience of realizing that Christianity is a cult, just as bizarre as all the other groups we previously called a \u0022cult.\u0022\n\u2022 The experience of getting pulled into the Hebrew Roots movement, as a means of experiencing being \u0022grafted in\u0022 to Israel, to honor the eternal Levitical priesthood, and to see the Bible as more of a single cohesive message from god.\n\u2022 The strange mindset of the Yahweh character, who is made to focus on what kind of clothes his people wear and what kind of food they eat, but he is silent about genocide, child rape, etc.\n\u2022 How Christians treat you as a traitor, both when you switch denominations, and much more so when you claim the Yahweh and Jesus characters aren\u0027t real and that the Bible is not divine.\n\u2022 The traumatic experience and true grieving process of deconstruction and deconversion, as you realize reality has nothing to do with the worldview espoused by Christianity or the Bible.\n\u2022 How Christians will often mistreat or shun you if you deconvert, as they brand you a severe traitor and live out the saying, \u0022There\u0027s no hate like Christian love,\u0022 demonstrating how shallow the relationship really was since it was based on mythology.\n\u2022 The urgency of exposing the discrepancies and mythology of Judaism and Christianity, especially in light of Christian nationalism.\n\u2022 How Christianity causes you to \u0022second guess\u0022 yourself constantly.\n\u2022 The bizarre and disgusting dynamics of blood magic that are woven into the core of Judaism and Christianity.\n\u2022 How Christianity teaches you to not trust yourself and to not see yourself as your own, but as belonging to the Yahweh and Jesus characters.\n\u2022 How the Bible employs psychological and mind control tactics to ensure submission, conformity, and fear.\n\u2022 How Christians refuse to share with their congregations the origins and evolution of the Yahweh character, along with his wife Asherah and father Elyon.\n\u2022 The frightening power of brainwashing to totally overwhelm the thought processes of Christians.\n\u2022 How terrorizing it is to Christians to admit the huge cracks in their worldview, exposing why they cannot honestly face the facts about the origins of their cult.\n\u2022 The absurd arguments and wrangling Christians use to try to defend their worldview.\n\u2022 The bizarre dynamics of church councils taking hundreds of years to vote on the canon, and books floating in and out of favor with the church councils.\n\u2022 How the peace after deconversion is much greater than the pretend peace of Christianity.\n\nThanks to Deborah for sharing her story and for all the research and deep thought she put into her book.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nMentioned in this video:\n\nNew Testament

      "description": "T/W: discussion of religious trauma, extreme nightmares\n\nToday I spoke with Stevie Noah, who grew up in the Assemblies of God denomination and went through severe religious trauma before ultimately deconverting from Christianity.\n\nWe discussed many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 How every religion and denomination thinks it is the right one and is most closely aligned to truth.\n\u2022 How religious trauma is often passed down to the next generation.\n\u2022 The extremely heavy weight of patriarchal ideas on women.\n\u2022 The experience of constantly feeling bad and guilty for displeasing the god character.\n\u2022 Being seen as permanently damaged goods if you lose your virginity outside of marriage.\n\u2022 How many Christians are publicly shamed in church if they stray from sexual \u0022purity.\u0022\n\u2022 The many ways that the Bible blames women for sin, demeans women, and tells them to keep quiet--and the bizarre ways that progressive Christians try to downplay those verses.\n\u2022 How women\u0027s periods are described in the Bible as making them unclean -- even though it\u0027s supposedly the Yahweh character who designed them that way.\n\u2022 The horrors of the Biblical prescriptions for a rapist to just pay a few pieces of silver to his victim\u0027s father, and for her to become his wife forever, as well as the commands for the \u0022men of god\u0022 to kidnap young girls and take them as child brides (or worse) after slaughtering the girl\u0027s entire family during the genocides and land theft commanded by the Yahweh character.\n\u2022 How religious trauma can create long-lasting nightmares in kids who have been deeply indoctrinated, especially by messages of pending punishment, end times, and the supernatural realm.\n\u2022 How the Abrahamic religions cause you to become OCD about asking for forgiveness from the god character.\n\u2022 How scaring kids about hell is a form of psychological child abuse.\n\u2022 The many issues with the Gospel story and worldview, including voluntarily giving up your rationality in order to embrace mythology, removing personal responsibility for sin, telling people they are wicked and worthless without a psycho god who claims to love them but threatens eternal punishment if they don\u0027t love him back.\n\u2022 How church services are set up to emotionally and psychologically manipulate attendees.\n\u2022 How Christianity removes people\u0027s ability to truly question the worldview they\u0027ve been given, \n\u2022 The importance of honestly questioning everything.\n\u2022 Realizing that there is an overwhelming amount of information about the origins of Christianity that you were never told before, and how that information exponentially speeds up the deconversion process, especially as it becomes evident that the authors of the Bible copied profusely from many other sources, such as Homer, Euripides, Virgil, Pythagoras, etc.\n\u2022 Learning to reframe your life after deconversion, starting with being quiet and alone, training yourself to understand reality, deciding who you want to be apart from other people\u0027s worldviews and opinions, learning how to have peace, getting rid of guilt and self-doubt, building up your self-worth, and truly enjoying pleasure.\n\u2022 The importance of healing from religious trauma, and how to get started in that process.\n\nThanks to Stevie for sharing her story, and for the inspiration and healing she brings through her YouTube channel!\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nConnect with Stevie:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/iamstevienoah/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/thisisstevienoah\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/stevienoahvideos\n\nstevie@stevienoah.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n*** Please subscribe to my other channels ***\n(many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",

      "description": "(The interview starts at 6 minutes in).\n\n________________________________\n \nToday I spoke with Gayle Jordan, mother of 4, blogger, attorney, and the Executive Director at Recovering From Religion.  She shared her story growing up in the Southern Baptist Church and being involved in ministry until she dug into the discrepancies of the Bible and its horrible teachings, and ultimately deconverted.\n\nAs we talked through Gayle\u0027s story, we touched on many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 Encouraging kids to relentlessly pursue the truth and to ask hard questions.\n\u2022 The experience of hanging on to belief even when we have many reasons to deconvert.\n\u2022 The freedom to reimagine our lives after deconversion\n\u2022 How life is much more glorious after leaving belief in a deity.\n\u2022 The power of indoctrination to make bad ideas sound acceptable, as it bypasses the critical thinking filter.\n\u2022 The importance of giving kids the power to believe what they want to believe and to allow them to be freethinkers.\n\u2022 How the threat of eternal punishment is a form extortion.\n\u2022 How the Yahweh character is an extremely unforgiving, sadistic, and psychotic character.\n\u2022 The typical Christian teaching that people are being tortured in eternal conscious torment and that Yahweh will never let them out of hell or stop the torture.\n\u2022 The Christian cycle of having \u0022mountaintop\u0022 experiences and then crashing down to real life and to sin, pushing people to seek to be even more committed.\n\u2022 The common Christian experience of rededicating oneself to the Lord repeatedly, to be sure it is real--especially since hell is at stake.\n\u2022 The ways that teachings about original sin and depravity beat people up emotionally, leave them defeated, and teach them to obsessively re-examine their thoughts and motives.\n\u2022 Healing from the ways the ways the Christian worldview instill fear in people through teachings on the end times and the spirit world.\n\u2022 Dissecting and analyzing the Christian worldview, and realizing how bad the thinking is.\n\u2022 How the Christian ideas of heaven create a fantasy that detracts from the actual reality we do have and keeps people from enjoying their lives today.\n\u2022 How teachings on the end times and about the god character creating a new heaven and earth lead Christians to treat climate change as a non-issue.\n\u2022 How patriarchy and misogyny are such a fundamental part of the Judeo-Christian narrative that most believers do not even question it.\n\u2022 The overwhelming damage done from the biblical teaching on sex and the church\u0027s desire to control and define people\u0027s sexuality.\n\u2022 The intense ways that Christian reject and attack people who deconvert, treating them as traitors.\n\u2022 Experiencing the \u0022light, air, and space\u0022 of the deconversion experience.\n\u2022 How the beauty, joy, and delight of life start when we take off the god glasses, bringing freedom from horrific and bizarre dogma, the space to be who we want to be, the opportunity to draw upon all possible solutions, and the removal of the narrow and false worldview of Christianity.\n\u2022 How Christianity preys on children\u0027s best instincts and traumatizes them as the church portrays the crucifixion story and tell children they are to blame for what Jesus \u0022had to do\u0022 to save them from their terrible wickedness.\n\u2022 The ways that the Recovering From Religion organization helps provide hope, healing, and support for people who are struggling with issues of doubt and non-belief, and the great work of the Secular Therapy Project.\n\u2022 The importance of fully grieving the loss of the Christian worldview after you realize it\u0027s mythology and escape the Bible prison.\n\u2022 Dealing with the lingering fear of hell, anger about being duped by Christians and the church, and the fracture relationships that come as a result of deconverting.\n\nMany thanks to Gayle for sharing her amazing journey with us, and for everything she does to help people recover from religion.\n

      "description": "Today I spoke with Derrick Day, a former Christian preacher who dabbled in progressive Christianity for a time before fully deconverting.\n\nAs we walked through his story, we touched on various topics, such as:\n\n\u2022 How the horrific Christian response to the social and political issues of the last few years has helped many people see through the hypocrisy and foolishness of Christianity and the church.\n\u2022 How the Bible is used for subjugation and control.\n\u2022 The Biblical perspective of focusing on minute details (how to tithe, what fabrics to weave together), while ignoring gross injustices.\n\u2022 The only passage in the Bible that talks directly about abortion (Numbers 5), where the Yahweh character advises a priest how to create a magic dust potion and create abortions in supposedly unfaithful women.\n\u2022 How the Bible does not stand up under honest scrutiny.\n\u2022 The fact that there were dozens of other gospels and epistles, and that most Christians are entirely unaware of them, unaware of how some went in and out of the canon, fail to ask the questions of why those other books were left out, and fail to be shocked at why their church leaders never mentioned them.\n\u2022 The appeal yet ultimate emptiness of progressive Christianity.\n\u2022 The idea that if you haven\u0027t at least flirted with the idea that there is no god, you haven\u0027t deconstructed far enough.\n\u2022 How the evolution of humanity\u0027s mindset will require us to jettison religion.\n\u2022 How leaving Christianity is about graduating from bad ideas in order to become the best person and embrace the most accurate worldview we can.\n\nThanks to Derrick for sharing some of his story today \u2026 I can\u0027t wait to connect with him again!\n\n_______________________________________\n\n\nDerrick\u0027s Amazon page\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Derrick-E-Day/e/B01N6KOGRM/\n\nThe Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\nhttps://heretichappyhour.podbean.com/\n\nDerrick\u0027s blog: Love Minus Religion\nhttps://www.patheos.com/blogs/loveminusreligion/\n\nDerrick\u0027s Youtube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/agapedominion\n\nDerrick\u0027s multimedia FB page:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/derrickdaymultimedia\n\n_______________________________________\n\n\nAlso mentioned in this video:\n\nMythVision / Derek Lambert\u0027s YT channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/MythVisionPodcast/videos\n\nDragons in Genesis\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/DragonsinGenesisPodcast/videos\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n*** Please subscribe to my other channels ***\n(many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",

      "description": "This video is about our need to resist the hate speech otherwise known as Christianity.  I hope you\u0027ll join me and help change our world for the better by pushing back against mythological worldviews.\n--Tim\n\n______________________________________\n\nThe Bible is hate speech, and inspires its followers to hate speech and a hateful worldview.  This is just the tip of the iceberg:\n\nPsalm 139:21-22 ESV\nDo I not hate those who hate you, O Lord? And do I not loathe those who rise up against you? I hate them with complete hatred; I count them my enemies.\n\nEzekiel 25:17 ESV\nI will execute great vengeance on them with wrathful rebukes. Then they will know that I am the Lord, when I lay my vengeance upon them.\n\nRevelation 21:8 ESV\nBut as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.\n\n2 Thessalonians 1:7-9, ESV\nwhen the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels 8 in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.  They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might.\n\nJude 1:7 ESV\nJust as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire.\n\nMatthew 10:15 ESV\nTruly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.\n\nMatthew 10:28 ESV\nAnd do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.\n\n2 Thessalonians 1:9 ESV\nThey will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might,\n\nMatthew 25:46 ESV\nAnd these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.\n\nGenesis 19:24 ESV\nThen the Lord rained on Sodom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the Lord out of heaven.\n\nDeuteronomy 20:17 ESV\nBut you shall devote them to complete destruction, the Hittites and the Amorites, the Canaanites and the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites, as the Lord your God has commanded.\n\n1 Corinthians 6:9-10 ESV\nOr do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.\n\nPsalm 137:8-9 ESV\nO daughter of Babylon, doomed to be destroyed,\n    blessed shall he be who repays you\n    with what you have done to us!\nBlessed shall he be who takes your little ones\n    and dashes them against the rock!\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n*** Please subscribe to my other channels ***\n(many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",

      "description": "Today I spoke with Tara Banks, who grew up in a Fundamental Baptist church environment, but eventually deconverted after thinking through the philosophical issues of the Christian worldview and the origins of Christianity.\n\nAs we discussed her journey, we touched on many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 How church teachings can cause people to have nonstop fears, and even nightmares, about dying and going to hell, being tortured, dealing with demons, or the Rapture taking place and some people being left behind.\n\u2022 How the Christian worldview tries to remove a person\u0027s power and well-being through fear tactics.\n\u2022 The discrepancy of the Yahweh character requiring forgiveness of his people, and yet being one of the most unforgiving literary characters ever invented.\n\u2022 How Christians are effectively predators of young children, taking advantage of their ignorance, preying on their ability to be easily molded and indoctrinated, sheltering them from alternative perspectives of reality, and psychologically scarring them in various ways.\n\u2022 How Christians frequently discourage questioning the bizarre stories, doctrines, and discrepancies of the Bible, insisting only on blind faith and obedience.\n\u2022 How Christians ignore the reality that there are multiple canons across Christendom, and multiple versions of the books in the canons.\n\u2022 How Christians try to harmonize the two creation stories in Genesis, and ignore the other mythologies of that era, such as Lilith, Enoch, etc.\n\u2022 The idea that Yahweh would kill his own son, but he won\u0027t just kill Satan right from the beginning.\n\u2022 How the Judeo-Christian worldview depicts women as inferior afterthoughts and ensures they have very limited power in the faith community.\n\u2022 How women are seen as inherently temptresses, and men as out of control in their sexuality, women consistently to blame--rarely men--for sexual temptations and scandals.\n\u2022 How Christianity convinces people that they are endlessly blameworthy  because any lack of peace or joy or commitment is entirely our fault, not god\u0027s.\n\u2022 The common experience of Christians feeling the need to \u0022get saved\u0022 or be \u0022born again\u0022 over and over, in case it was potentially not real the first time.\n\u2022 The experience of watching Christianity\u0027s claims collapse around you.\n\u2022 How Christianity causes emotional damage as it tears you down and leaves you feeling constantly deficient, as you wait on a non-existent deity to transform you or reveal himself or his will to you.\n\u2022 How Christians force believers to witness to others and push the narrative that \u0022their blood is on our hands\u0022 if we don\u0027t share the Gospel.\n\u2022 How the church divides and polarizes the world into \u0022us vs. them,\u0022 i.e. worldly sinners vs. Christians. \n\u2022 How Christians desensitize people from the horrific teachings of the Bible by instilling the stories in them at a very young age and trying to use the \u0022holiness of god\u0022 as an excuse to justify genocide and other crimes.\n\u2022 Being able to see the universe as much more beautiful once you remove mythological worldviews.\n\u2022 The importance, after deconversion, of building a community that can support you.\n\u2022 The importance of being patient with ourselves as we heal from a religious worldview and from religious trauma.\n\n \nMany thanks to Tara for sharing her story!\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n*** Please subscribe to my other channels ***\n(many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",

Our goal is not to argue with them more, it is to ignore their ridiculous arguments and charlatanism.  We thrive best we lower the volume on those who would try to force their blood magic, scapegoating, human sacrifice death cult on us and our children.\n\nThank you all for your support and daily encouragement!  \n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n*** Please subscribe to my other channels ***\n(many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",

      "description": "Today I spoke with Dr. David D\u0027Andre, who grew up in an independent, fundamental Baptist environment, and even went into ministry and missions, until he eventually deconverted from Christianity.\n\nAs we discussed his journey, we touched on many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 The ways that Calvinism is detrimental to our emotional and mental health.\n\u2022 The idea that healing, in large part, involves the release of fear and pain, and since the Christian message by definition revolves around the fear of who we are in light of who god is, inner healing requires moving on from Christianity.\n\u2022 How the Yahweh character never shows unconditional love, instead always basing his actions on fear, manipulation, and eternal punishment.\n\u2022 The psychopathic nature of the requirement of perfection/righteousness, and its corollary requirement, penal substitution.\n\u2022 The dynamics behind Christians blaming AIDS and natural disasters on homosexuality.\n\u2022 The experience of growing up knowing we were \u0022sinners in the hands of an angry god\u0022 and in danger of actual hellfire.\n\u2022 The idea that saying the words, \u0022I believe in Jesus\u0022 becomes a form of using magic words, in order to gain personal access to substitutionary atonement.\n\u2022 Christian mixed messages over receiving all your wisdom from god--via the Bible--versus just hearing directly from god.\n\u2022 The practical Christian experience of opening the Bible to a random page and expecting to receive a personal message from god for you from those verses.\n\u2022 The moment we realize that it\u0027s a strong possibility that god is a figment of our imagination.\n\u2022 How discarding the belief in a literal hell is often the first step toward deconversion, especially as we realize that if there is no hell, there\u0027s no real need for Christianity.\n\u2022 Growing up in a church context where you\u0027re not allowed to fully admit and deal honestly with Bible discrepancies and other issues with the Christian worldview.\n\u2022 Realizing how textual criticism and the documentary hypothesis affect our view of Biblical inspiration and inerrancy.\n\u2022 Learning to switch our mentalities from god and the Bible being the judge of us, to us becoming the judge of the Bible and of the Yahweh character.\n\u2022 Realizing there is no divine presence in the universe, and the implications.\n\u2022 Seeing that Christianity taught us to categorize everyone we meet: saved vs. damned, elect vs. non-elect, insiders vs. outsiders, etc., and the relief of being able to finally see people for who they are without imposing our agenda or worldview on them.\n\u2022 The damage done by the Christian message of \u0022You are broken and incomplete, and you have a void in your life that only god can fill,\u0022 and the perspective shift that occurs when you realize that there is no god, so there is no god-shaped void, and that we are not waiting for a deity to complete and redeem us.\n\u2022 How breaking the hold of the biblical worldview on our lives frees our minds and gives us a chance to truly thrive.\n\u2022 The dynamic of pastors and teachers withholding critical information regarding the origins of Christianity and Judaism from their congregations and students.\n\u2022 How Christian doctrines can be especially harmful to those who do not have kind parents, as messages of unworthiness and badness are mixed with a lack of love.\n\nThanks to Dr. D\u0027Andre for sharing his story and for his great insights!\n\n______________________________________\n\n\nConnect with Dr. D\u0027Andre:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/david.dandre\nand\nhttps://www.facebook.com/daviddandrephd/\n\n______________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.  \nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nThe more support I receive, the sooner I can do this full time!\n--Tim",

      "description": "Today I spoke with Jillian Aurora, who grew up in an ultra-conservative, fundamentalist Christian environment until she deconstructed its core beliefs, and ultimately deconverted.\n\nAs we talked through her story, we discussed:\n\n\u2022 Being extremely sheltered, even within the church.\n\u2022 The practice of \u0022shadowing,\u0022 where children must be near their parents at all times in order to deeply condition Christian behaviors.\n\u2022 The idea of women having to wear dresses, be domesticated, and put very little focus on their education beyond homemaking and child rearing.\n\u2022 The idealization of ultra-young marriage of women and having many children (quiverfull).\n\u2022 The very dark sides of purity culture, with its emphasis on the inherently seductive nature of womanhood.\n\u2022 The idea that the more extreme you are, the more evidence you show of your commitment to Jesus.\n\u2022 Going through seasons of purging worldly items from your life to demonstrate a willingness to give up anything for Jesus and to be more holy.\n\u2022 How conservative Christianity burns patriarchy into your psyche via a male god, male church leadership, husband and father leadership, the husband representing the holy god and the wife representing the sinful church, women needing to keep quiet in church and being the weaker vessel, and especially in the idea of a daughter submitting to her father\u0027s ownership until he passes that ownership to her future husband.\n\u2022 How people are taught to submit to authority, even bad authority, and are thus very vulnerable to abuse.\n\u2022 How the combination of Christianity\u0027s loyalty programming and injunctions to constantly give selflessly often leads to extreme codependency and open the door to abuse.\n\u2022 The path to reclaiming personal authority, and especially feminine authority for women escaping from a patriarchal mindset and culture.\n\u2022 How the Bible is hateful, horrific, and sexist toward women.\n\u2022 How the idea that the Christian worldview is intrinsically broken and flawed can be such a terrifying and threatening concept to believers, and why they cannot even begin to entertain that possibility.\n\u2022 Dealing with Christians who try to explain away others\u0027 deconversions.\n\u2022 Learning that your own self-worth has no prerequisites, in direct opposition to the message of the Bible.\n\u2022 How a lot of adherence to Christianity stems from nothing more than social conditioning.\n\u2022 Learning to trust ourselves and our own wisdom again after we realize that the god we were supposed to be trusting and listening to doesn\u0027t exist and that the supposed wisdom of the Bible is actually a terrible worldview.\n\u2022 Realizing that goddess worship was once a major part of Judaism and Christianity.\n\u2022 Basing personal relationships on a partnership paradigm instead of a hierarchy paradigm.\n\nMany thanks to Jillian for sharing her story, and for her amazing work to help others heal and thrive!\n\n______________________________________\n\n\nConnect with Jillian\nhttps://www.jillianaurora.com/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/iamunapologetic\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/braveheartconversations\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/iamawarriorgoddess\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goddesscoaching/\n\n______________________________________\n\n\nMentioned in this interview:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Pure-Inside-Evangelical-Movement-Generation-ebook/dp/B075RLVVXW/\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/s?k=brene\u002Bbrown\n\n______________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.  \nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nThe more support I receive, the sooner I can do this full time!\n--Tim",

Neil grew up in a liberal Methodist background, then got pulled into the Worldwide Church of God cult before he questioned Christian assumptions and examined every layer of his beliefs, and ultimately deconverted from Christianity.\n\nAfter we briefly discussed his personal story, we went on to discuss various topics, including:\n\n\u2022 The ways that churches condition people to fall in line with their thinking.\n\u2022 How tithing requirements can make the givers destitute.\n\u2022 How \u0022using the Bible to interpret the Bible\u0022 ends up distorting our ability to see the Bible as a collection of different books with often opposing messages.\n\u2022 The dynamic of church leaders expecting you to follow their convictions, and then after they move on or die, the next church leaders expect you to follow their different convictions.\n\u2022 \u0022Waking up\u0022 and realizing that our prayers are going to a non-existent character, that the Bible is nonsense, and that Christianity is as good as fairy tales.\n\u2022 Realizing it\u0027s our faith that is propelling Christianity, not a real god.\n\u2022 The ways many Christian denominations fight against evolution, despite the overwhelming scientific evidence.\n\u2022 The experience of admitting to ourselves that we had fallen for significant logical fallacies when we were Christians.\n\u2022 The important contributions of Earl Doherty (author, \u0022The Jesus Puzzle: Did Christianity Begin with a Mythical Christ?\u0022 and \u0022Jesus: Neither God Nor Man - The Case for a Mythical Jesus\u0022)\n\u2022 The ways that \u0022consensus\u0022 berates and shuns those who don\u0027t agree with them, and how their failure to address critical and relevant questions, and instead just dismiss them, leads people to more easily see the failures of the consensus and to continue on to better questions and research.\n\u2022 Learning to see the Gospels as re-writes of Old Testament stories.\n\u2022 How the books \u0022The Ascension of Isaiah\u0022 and \u0022Enoch\u0022 affected the origins of Christianity.\n\u2022 How the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD was a large impetus behind the creation of early Christianity.\n\u2022 The question of whether ancient Rome had any part to play in the origins of Christianity.\n\u2022 Trying to understand how early Christianity, where the Jesus story was a parable, got turned into a historicized story.\n\u2022 How to view Christianity and other Christians after we have deconverted.\n \n\nUnending thanks to Neil for his studies and for sharing his fantastic insights with us as we work to understand the true origins of Christianity.\n\n______________________________________\n\n\nMentioned in this interview\n\nNeil\u0027s websites:\nhttps://vridar.org/\nhttp://vridar.info/\n\nNeil\u0027s story\nhttps://vridar.org/2011/05/03/i-left-the-cult-and-met-the-enemy/\nhttps://vridar.org/tag/neil-godfrey/\n\nEarl Doherty\u0027s books\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Earl-Doherty/e/B00MMKLHL2\n\n\u0022J\u00E9sus-Christ, sublime figure de papier\u0022 by Nanine Charbonnel\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Jesus-Christ-Sublime-Figure-de-Papier/dp/2370201096/\n\n______________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.  \nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nThe more support I receive, the sooner I can do this full time!\n--Tim",

      "description": "Today I spoke with Monica Dux, a writer, social commentator, and columnist in Australia.  We discussed her experience growing up Catholic, and even wanting to be a nun, before she eventually deconverted.\n\nWe touched on many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 Seeing the Jesus character \u0022repackaged\u0022 after Vatican II.\n\u2022 Wanting to feel god\u0027s presence, but never actually having any sense that he was real.\n\u2022 Being afraid of purgatory and hell.\n\u2022 The consuming ideas of confession and of purging your soul.\n\u2022 Going through various motions to show piety and devotion to god, including giving things up for him, so that there will be some kind of positive response from god.\n\u2022 How stricter, ritualistic versions of Catholicism and other religions are very similar to tribal animism.\n\u2022 How repetition as a child creates an imprint on your mind and worldview, and the importance of stopping childhood indoctrination.\n\u2022 How ex-communication and god\u0027s \u0022get out of jail free cards\u0022 work in Catholicism.\n\u2022 The strange way that the god character in the Bible seems able to be easily duped and manipulated.\n\u2022 The fact that many people in the church don\u0027t actually know why they\u0027re doing what they\u0027re doing, even when the rituals and actions they do are bizarre.\n\u2022 How religion is mostly about power and control.\n\u2022 How trying to \u0022feel\u0022 god when he\u0027s truly not there is like trying to fall in love with someone that you just don\u0027t love.\n\u2022 How the church tries to dictate perspectives on sexuality, masturbation, pleasure, and family planning.\n\u2022 How the choice to reject religion is, at the same time, a choice to embrace something positive and wonderful.\n\u2022 The way the church instills in you that you are sinful and unworthy.\n\u2022 How deconversion is like an unraveling of belief that takes time to walk through and recover from, as we reclaim our identity and move past religious baggage.\n\nThanks to Monica for sharing her fascinating story and journey!\n \n_________________________________\n\n\nConnect with Monica Dux:\nhttps://www.monicadux.com.au/\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Lapsed/dp/0733340814/",

      "description": "Today I spoke with Steve Hilliker, the creator and host of the podcast \u0022Voices of Deconversion.\u0022\n\nWe had an open dialogue about various topics as we talked through the highlights of his deconversion from Christianity, touching on topics such as:\n\n\u2022 The fear-based love of Christianity.\n\u2022 Believing in the Rapture, Tribulation, and 2nd coming of Jesus.\n\u2022 Repeatedly rededicating his life to god to make sure it was real and that he was \u0022definitely\u0022 saved\n\u2022 The cycle of thinking you want/need god, and then sinning, so realizing you want/need god even more to resolve the sin issue, and then sinning again/more, so wanting god even more, ultimately going to more and more extremes to please him.\n\u2022 The cycle of shame that is wrapped up in the pretend relationship that Christians think they have with the god character.\n\u2022 How Christianity pounds into your mind that you are the problem--because the problem cannot be god, the Bible, or the Christian worldview.\n\u2022 The ways that Christianity has the god character watching you and seeing inside your head, and constantly judging you.\n\u2022 The idea that you are nothing without god.\n\u2022 The idea that apostates are worse than those who have never heard the Gospel yet.\n\u2022 The ways that early church councils decided on what was \u0022orthodox\u0022 based on majority rule, power struggles, and infighting.\n\u2022 The idea of asking god to do whatever it takes--deprive us of good things, of our dreams, etc.--to make us holy.\n\u2022 The experience of constantly hoping to \u0022hear\u0022 from god and never hearing from him--and doubling down on our efforts to hear from him.\n\u2022 The idea that god can only \u0022use\u0022 you if he \u0022breaks\u0022 you first.\n\u2022 The Christian mentality of quiverfull, being fruitful and multiplying, and of outbreeding the pagans.\n\u2022 The idea of god \u0022coming into your story\u0022 when you are at your weakest/lowest point--and what it does to people when they feel like god never showed up in those dark times of life.\n\u2022 The way that Bible discrepancies as well as varying interpretations of Biblical doctrines, evolution, etc., can help start the deconstruction process.\n\u2022 How people can slowly get fed up with believing in an illogical fantasy world.\n\u2022 The fact that there have been many stories of dying and rising gods, and that Christianity doesn\u0027t look at all like the original, but a story that emerged out of other worldviews and stories/holy books.\n\u2022 How learning about the formation of the Bible / canonicity helps advance deconstruction.\n\u2022 The emotions of falling in love with the god/Jesus characters and then realizing they have never been real.\n\u2022 The ways that Christian apologists are extreme charlatans.\n\u2022 How Christians ignore comparative mythology and the history of the Levant around the several hundred years around the time that Christianity formed.\n\u2022 Facing the moral atrocities of the Old Testament and the Yahweh character, and admitting that the Yahweh character is a tyrant.\n\u2022 Being \u0022unequally yoked,\u0022 where a Christian is married to someone who is no longer a believer.\n\u2022 Reclaiming your identity after deconversion, especially regarding your moral compass and your strengths.\n\u2022 How to begin healing from religious trauma, especially embracing reality when you\u0027ve been sold a fantasy.\n\u2022 Why the Christian delusion is so toxic for our world.\n \n\nThanks to Steve for his Voices of Deconversion podcast, and all the ways he helps the deconstructing and deconverting community.\n\n______________________________________\n\n\nConnect with Steve:\n\nhttps://voicesofdeconversion.com/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/vodpodcast\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzyPNxMCF-Fo_INpOgADrng/videos\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Voices-of-Deconversion/dp/B08JJTC2H3\n\n______________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.  \nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nThe more support I receive, the sooner I can do this full time!\n--Tim",

      "description": "Today I spoke with TV anchor and radio personality Cheryl Marella, who grew up exposed to Catholicism first, then Protestantism and being \u0022born again,\u0022 before she began her deconstruction and eventual deconversion from Christianity.\n\nWe covered many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 Seeing her parents get \u0022born again\u0022 and how other family members got pressured to do the same.\n\u2022 Experiencing a barrage of Christian events that were designed to indoctrinate.\n\u2022 Growing up under a strict and fierce preacher.\n\u2022 Being told that god intends for you to suffer a lot as part of his master plan.\n\u2022 How transforming our minds away from religion helps us to thrive.\n\u2022 How patriarchy, especially from religion, creates a stifling and toxic environment, but is accepted, even by women, due to extensive brainwashing.\n\u2022 How a lot of faith is based on fear of punishment and hell.\n\u2022 Grappling with the experience of sincerely wanting god to feel real to you, but never actually feeling his presence or feeling like the teachings make any significant difference to your life experience.\n\u2022 Realizing during deconstruction that we don\u0027t agree with the Bible\u0027s bizarre morality anymore.\n\u2022 Working through how Christianity denigrates people\u0027s self-worth and teaches us we are broken without the psychotic and bloodthirsty Yahweh character.\n\u2022 Healing from the injunction to submit -- to the Bible, to the mythological Yahweh character, to church leadership, and (for women) to men.\n\u2022 The dynamic of Christians feeling like they should have a platform and a strong voice, but that others who disagree with them should have their platform diminished or silenced.\n\u2022 Dealing with anger after we deconvert, as we realize others who were steeped in mythology were dominating our lives and decisions for many years.\n\u2022 Realizing that sexuality and pleasure are beautiful and healthy parts of life, especially as we remove shame and \u0022dirtiness\u0022 from our worldviews.\n\u2022 Grappling with the reality that years of brainwashing cannot be undone quickly, and searching for the many roots of religious ideas that are deep in our psyches.\n\u2022 Learning to own the process of reclaiming our identity and the life skill of loving ourselves just as we are, apart from the god character and the Bible\u0027s false messages.\n\u2022 Dealing with the (often) total lack of compassion from Christians.\n\u2022 Learning to live in the present once you realize the afterlife is made up as part of mythology.\n\u2022 Undo the damage of the teaching that we need to distrust ourselves, and instead trust the Yahweh character, with his capricious, bizarre, psychopathic, narcissistic, bloodthirsty nature.\n\u2022 Deconstructing the teachings of the eternal, infinite, conscious torture of hell over finite sins.\n\u2022 How Christians think they are on the right path and everyone else is fringe, even though they are extremely fringe, compared to reality.\n\u2022 How to begin healing from religious trauma.\n\u2022 How dealing with friends who are still stuck in the Bible prison feels like a nonstop battle.\n\u2022 The importance of pursuing the truth, regardless of where it takes us.\n \nMany thanks to Cheryl for sharing her story, and for the many ways she reminds us to get empowered, educated, inspired, to love ourselves, and to awaken as many people as possible of the importance of self-improvement.\n\n_________________________________\n\nConnect with Cheryl at:\nhttps://www.cherylmarella.net/\n\n_________________________________\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.

      "description": "Today I spoke with Pablo Chaverri, who was raised Catholic, and even being groomed to become a priest, until he thought deeply about the background, content, and implications of the Christian faith, and ultimately deconverted from Christianity.\n\nWe talked about:\n\n\u2022 How culture and social cognition shape our worldview and beliefs.\n\u2022 How church leaders manipulate poor people through the demand of a tithe to the church in order to be blessed.\n\u2022 The idea that when things go well in your life, it\u0027s because of god\u0027s blessing, but when things go badly, it\u0027s due to your lack of faith or because of demonic activity.\n\u2022 How Catholic teachings on hell instill fear in children.\n\u2022 The Catholic church\u0027s obsession with making young people ashamed over masturbation.\n\u2022 The Catholic church\u0027s extreme and criminal abuse of children.\n\u2022 How the Catholic church instills fear in believers with the fear of dying without unconfessed in.\n\u2022 The psychological damage of forcing people to constantly search their hearts for secret/unconscious sins.\n\u2022 How the Catholic church teaches followers that sex is mostly for procreation instead of for pleasure and enjoyment.\n\u2022 How Christianity effectively teaches you to see god as a safety net and a magic charm.\n\u2022 The ways that Christianity is a form of mental control, where the god character knows everything and can read your mind, and he requires you to think and act correctly, with full sincerity and no doubt, or he will be angry at you.\n\u2022 The ways that even smart people can drop their critical thinking and start basing their thoughts on magic and superstition.\n\u2022 The ways that Christians want to \u0022feel\u0022 more than they want to think and analyze.\n\u2022 Dealing with our intense desire for their to be hope beyond our physical life.\n\u2022 How Christianity and its make-believe afterlife doctrine effectively keeps people from truly grieving when someone\u0027s death, because we are not truly grieving their one life, we are grieving as if it is temporary and we are going to see them again.\n\u2022 The bizarreness of the teaching that the slaughter of an innocent person can resolve another person\u0027s guilt.\n\u2022 How Christianity is a blood magic death cult.\n\u2022 How Christianity is a cult of suffering.\n\u2022 How skepticism and critical thinking, without any fear, is far better than faith.\n\u2022 How Christianity uses guilt to manipulate people.\n\u2022 The deeply disturbing psychological abuse that Christianity inflicts on children.\n\u2022 The ways Christians act like they have hurt feelings, instead of choosing to embrace critical thinking, when the inconsistencies and contradictions of their worldview are exposed.\n\u2022 How Christianity trains people in the habit of believing lies.\n \nThanks to Pablo for sharing his thoughts on all these topics, and for his great insights!

      "description": "Today I spoke with author Jonathan M.S. Pearce about his new book \u0022The Resurrection: A Critical Examination of the Easter Story.\u0022\n\nAs we dove into his book, we touched on many aspects of the story of the resurrection of Jesus, including:\n\n\u2022 The elitist side of Christian apologetics, where apologists say that only if you study hard enough can you find the truth of how the atonement truly works.\n\u2022 The competing theories of atonement, including penal substitution.\n\u2022 Blood magic, Yom Kippur, and the Pascal lamb.\n\u2022 The moral culpability of the god character, who supposedly created the world with divine foreknowledge, yet his creation is a big mess theologically.\n\u2022 How god is burning most humans just to go to hell (or be annihilated).\n\u2022 The dynamic that stunningly extraordinary and exceptional claims require stunningly extraordinary and exceptional evidence.\n\u2022 The special pleading and begging that Christians do regarding the claims of the Gospels regarding the Resurrection, especially in light of prior probability, such as the way that Christians reject the claims of other similar Greco-Roman mystery cults while still claiming Christian claims are legitimate.\n\u2022 How the Gospels are written in unknown places, at unknown times, by unknown authors--none of whom were eyewitnesses--with ex-post-facto agendas, making claims to people who, at the time, did not verify the claims, and had no way of verifying them.\n\u2022 How the \u0022historical methods\u0022 used by the Gospels is exceptionally poor.\n\u2022 The fact that the NT writers had an agenda.\n\u2022 Realizing that Christians cannot imagine that the Resurrection might be simply \u0022made up,\u0022 even though the evidence overwhelmingly points that way.\n\u2022 Terror management: how Christians cannot rationally debate or analyze the claims and details of the NT, because they cannot handle the implications, which threaten their hope of an afterlife and their overall worldview.\n\u2022 Why we need to accept explanations that are most probable versus those that make claims which have no evidence and fall apart logically.\n\u2022 How childhood indoctrination sets us up to analyze the world based on what we\u0027re taught, versus what is probable, and how we can do it with other religions, but not our own.\n\u2022 How we are programmed to believe our elders.\n\u2022 The dangers of taking ideas \u0022on faith,\u0022 which amounts to belief without evidence.\n\u2022 How Christians claim that their evidence is much better than it really is.\n\u2022 How every single Gospel claim is problematic and easily challenged.\n\u2022 Realizing that while we were stuck in Christianity we were blind to its bizarreness, such as the doctrine of transubstantiation, where we \u0022eat the flesh and drink the blood\u0022 of our demigod.\n\u2022 How our dread of death and fears of mortality drive us to \u0022need\u0022 the story of the resurrection to be true.\n\u2022 How the Bible\u0027s god character creates a fa\u00E7ade of being a stabilizing and protective psychological function that \u0022fills the void.\u0022\n\u2022 The reality that absence of evidence for extraordinary claims DOES mean evidence of absence, if evidence never appears.\n\u2022 The fact that Paul provides almost no details about the resurrection, and that the Gospels introduce later embellishments to the early versions of the Resurrection story.\n\u2022 How the dynamics of apocalypticism and messianism could have mixed with the disappointment, grief, anger, and guilt of early Christians in order for them to come up with the Resurrection mythology.\n\u2022 How the Resurrection is \u0022theology with an agenda,\u0022 but not history.\n\u2022 The fact that we believe because of indoctrination and societal pressure, not because we\u0027ve truly studied the evidence.\n\u2022 Rebuilding our identities and worldview, and learning to celebrate life, after we realize that the resurrection stories are mythological.\n\u2022 And much more!\n\nThanks to Jonathan for his amazing insights and for helping us to see that the stories of Christianity are not history.\n\n_________________________________\n\n\nJonathan\u0027s website\nhttp://www.tipplingphilosopher.com/\n\nJonathan\u0027s blog\nhttps://patheos.com/blogs/tippling/\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ATipplingPhilosopher/\n\nAmazon page\nhttps://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/entity/author/B004DAVFKC?_encoding=UTF8\u0026node=2656022011\n\n____________________________________\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.

      "description": "Today I spoke with Jennifer Fernandez, who shared her story growing up in a conservative, fundamentalist Christian environment before going through the long and painful process of deconstructing and leaving Christianity.\n\nThroughout the interview, we touched on:\n\n\u2022 Enduring the personal oppressive holiness culture of Calvary Chapel.\n\u2022 Saying the \u0022sinners prayer\u0022 repeatedly to be sure she was saved.\n\u2022 Fear of being \u0022left behind\u0022 if the Rapture occurred and she was not saved.\n\u2022 Fear over demonic influences.\n\u2022 The dynamics of Christian homeschooling, including sheltering and protecting kids from worldly ideas, especially evolution.\n\u2022 How living in an area where most everyone is a Christian makes it easier to ignore the moral problems of the god character allowing others to burn in hell forever.\n\u2022 Constantly second guessing ourselves as Christians.\n\u2022 Shame and guilt over struggling to \u0022remain pure.\u0022\n\u2022 Being exposed to the cultish teachings of Bill Gothard.\n\u2022 The mentality behind the quiverfull movement and the desire to \u0022outbreed the pagans.\u0022\n\u2022 The pressure to speak in tongues.\n\u2022 How Christian authority figures create security, while at the same time instilling a fear of listening to anyone else.\n\u2022 Guilt over not going to church anymore, and the anxiety and shame over leaving the faith.\n\u2022 Fear over the early steps of deconstruction and where the hard questions might be leading.\n\u2022 No longer believing that a loving god could send people to burn in hell for all eternity.\n\u2022 Going through deconstruction in isolation, without any support or other people to talk to about it.\n\u2022 Dealing with the issue of homosexuality as a conservative evangelical Christian.\n\u2022 Beginning to question the Bible\u0027s inerrancy.\n\u2022 How the Bible\u0027s message is unclear and confusing.\n\u2022 Realizing the neurological dynamics happening inside the brains of religious believers.\n\u2022 How deconverting can shake us up as we realize the implications, but also frees us and gives us peace.\n\u2022 The identity crisis that deconversion presents to us, as we realize that our identity was caught up in a pretend god and our focus was wrapped up in a mythological worldview.\n\u2022 The role of good therapy in healing from religious trauma and reclaiming our identity after deconversion.\n\u2022 Adjusting to realizing there\u0027s probably no afterlife.\n \nThanks to Jennifer for sharing her story, and for the many insights she has been sharing with the community, especially regarding deconversion, purity culture, Christian homeschooling, and deconstructing while being focused on motherhood and family.

      "description": "Today I spoke with Keith Giles, an author, blogger, podcaster, and teacher who focuses on the dynamics of deconstruction.\n\nWe talked through his story growing up Southern Baptist and eventually becoming a pastor, when he started to analyze his beliefs and reassess his worldview.  We touched on various topics, such as:\n\n\u2022 God\u0027s wrath, penal substitution, eternal conscious torment, universal salvation, and the nature of the Gospel.\n\u2022 The history of canonicity, including the colorful and shaky history of how the canon came to be, and how there are various canons, even today.\n\u2022 The fact that many church fathers included books in the canon that many of us have never read or heard of, such as: the Didache, the Shepherd of Hermes, the Book of Baruch, Jubilees, the Letter of Jeremiah, and Enoch.  They also did not include all the books that were later added to the canon.\n\u2022 How to overcome the fear of asking hard questions and analyzing the faith we were taught as children.\n\u2022 Dealing with ostracization and loss of community when Christian family and friends realize you are deconstructing.\n\u2022 Respecting others who don\u0027t agree with where we \u0022land\u0022 during our deconstruction, i.e., people who remain in theism in some way vs. those who see no evidence for any gods.\n\u2022 The toxicity that can occur in certain theological constructs, and how to deal with loved ones who are still proponents of teachings we are strongly opposed to.\n\u2022 The pagan parallels and source stories that were used to create the Jesus character, such as Dionysius, Homer\u0027s epics, Pythagoras, the Zodiac (in the Gospel of Mark), Josephus, Plutarch, etc.\n\u2022 Realizing that each of us is probably not done changing our perspectives and worldview, even if we\u0027ve already changed a lot, and how that realization helps us to be more patient and gracious with others.\n\nMany thanks to Keith for the great questions he\u0027s always bringing to the table, the graciousness he shows to people who disagree with him, and his compassion for people who are deconstructing and reclaiming their identities as they reshape their worldviews and heal from religious trauma.\n\n\n_____________________________________\n\n\nKeith\u0027s website:\nhttp://www.KeithGiles.com\n\nKeith\u0027s blog:\nhttps://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/\n\nKeith\u0027s Youtube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/kgilesify\n\nThe Heretic Happy Hour Podcast:\nhttps://heretichappyhour.podbean.com/\nhttps://heretichappyhour.com/\n\nPacifist Fight Club\nwww.PacifistFightClub.com\n\nKeith\u0027s books on Amazon:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Keith-Giles/e/B0076E0UA8\n\nOr through his blog:\nhttps://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/publications/\n\nRead about his newest book, Before You Lose Your Mind:\nhttps://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2021/04/before-you-lose-your-mind-a-response-to-the-gospel-coalition/\n\nand read it here:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B093WM4X43/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0\n\n\n____________________________________\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.

      "description": "Today I spoke with Ralph Ellis, a historian and author who has spent more than three decades searching for secular similarities and parallels between the disciplines of history and theology. \n\nWe briefly discussed his background, and then dove into many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 How the Hebrews were actually the Hyksos, who did exit Egypt and conquer Canaan.\n\u2022 How the Garden of Eden was based on the Egyptian garden of Aten, and the fascinating history of Pharaoh Akhenaten and Queen Nefertiti, who were major players in the move toward monotheism, as they worshipped Aten, the sun disc.\n\u2022 The fact that neither the characters of Jesus and Paul are not attested in the historical record, and what that implies regarding the major cover-up of their true identities, including the kingdom of Edessa.\n\u2022 How the Gospels and Acts represent historical events and people, but 40 years later than Christians are taught.\n\u2022 The theological and academic blindness that keeps people from seeing alternatives to what they\u0027ve been taught, and how the issue is not just what people DON\u0027T know, but what they WON\u0027T know.\n\nMany thanks to Ralph for the many ways he sheds light on important issues and shares insightful historical connections.  His work inspires me more than ever to dig into history.\n\n_____________________________\n\n\nRalph\u0027s website\nhttp://edfu-books.uk/\n\nRalph\u0027s Youtube channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/ralphellis\n\nRalph\u0027s books on Amazon.com\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Ralph-Ellis/e/B0034PJHIE\n\n____________________________________\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.

      "description": "Today I spoke with Will Thorpe, who was a Christian for 20 years before his deconversion and the launch of his platform, Heretical Theology.\n\nWe touched on various topics and parts of his story, including:\n\n\u2022 Growing up in a Methodist environment.\n\u2022 Attending and being a counselor at Abstinence Camp,\n\u2022 Hearing god\u0027s voice and knowing his will, especially regarding going into ministry.\n\u2022 Working through marriage where one spouse deconverts a while before the other.\n\u2022 Going through a deconstruction himself later.\n\u2022 Experiencing the early part of deconstruction with the expectation that \u0022god\u0022 is going to fill in the gaps and resolve the issues, such that the end expectation was of a stronger Christian faith--not a deconversion.\n\u2022 Helping the church to understand that there are parts of their theology that are fundamentally dangerous to humanity.\n\u2022 Seeing the sexist side of church up-close.\n\u2022 Knowing the Bible inside and out, and yet not believing anymore.\n\u2022 Hearing the perspectives of atheists and textual critics, which fueled the deconstruction process.\n\u2022 Acknowledging that there are good things that the church does on the surface, but that doesn\u0027t rescue it from all the evil that it does.\n\u2022 Learning to love your spouse for who they really are, not for their faith and theology, or lack thereof.\n\u2022 Exemplifying the importance of \u0022unequally yoked\u0022 spouses loving and truly listening to each other.\n\u2022 Experiencing how the \u0022light bulb\u0022 comes on in our minds when we allow the possibility that the Bible is full of errors.\n\u2022 Realizing that elaborate Christian rationalizations and harmonizations don\u0027t actually work.\n\u2022 Facing the conundrum of whether we have satisfactory answers to the discrepancies and issues of the Bible, or whether the alternative is more likely.\n\u2022 Seeing the ridiculousness of how hard Christians try to ignore the pagan parallels of Jesus to the earlier Greco-Roman mystery cults.\n\u2022 Noticing that the Christian worldview creates a susceptibility to conspiracy theories.\n\u2022 Dealing with the cognitive dissonance of Christians who try to merge the Bible with science.\n\u2022 Realizing how ignorant we were when we were Christians, and how much we lacked truth and reasoning when we were stuck in it.\n\u2022 Seeing how Christian views of sexuality try to make us guilty of thought crimes.\n\nThanks to Will for all he does on the Heretical Theology platform, especially the ways he helps people to heal and thrive after deconversion.\n\n_______________________________\n\n\nConnect with Will!\n\nInstagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/heretical_theology/\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Heretical-Theology-104007741125939\n\nBlog\nhttps://hereticaltheology.blogspot.com/?fbclid=IwAR2ceztOm6NtFyFk6iw_B43klvJsMsfvgIsRfOCoGY7hvkN3iOTN20nCHZU\n\n_______________________________\n\nMentioned in the video:\n\nEhrman vs Wallace debate - Can We Trust the Text of the NT?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRHjZCKRIu4\n\nDebate on whether the Catholic Church is a Force for Good\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZRcYaAYWg4\n\nHitchens - Atheist Anthem\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj38jinDL_w\n\nYale Religious Courses (free)\nhttps://oyc.yale.edu/religious-studies\n\n____________________________________\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.

She hosts workshops called Divorcing Religion, as well as the Conference On Religious Trauma.\n\nAs we talked through her story together, touching on these aspects of her story and of the resulting insights:\n\n\u2022 Growing up and seeing other family members walk away from Christianity and determining to stay faithful to the Lord.\n\u2022 The dynamics of multi-generational brainwashing.\n\u2022 Legalistic Bible teachings regarding women being submissive to men and modestly dressed, and to fit in the roles assigned by the church.\n\u2022 Being exposed to the Holdeman Mennonite community.\n\u2022 How the ability to strictly obey the rules of church can lead to pride and a sense of being close to the Lord.\n\u2022 The anti-feminist perspectives of Christianity.\n\u2022 The negative ways that women are influenced by viewing their husbands as their god-given leader, and that god would speak to the men to give guidance for the family.\n\u2022 How community bubbles , especially conservative Christianity, create fundamentalist echo chambers.\n\u2022 How homeschooling plays into the Christian goal of protecting children from \u0022the world.\u0022\n\u2022 How seeds of doubt and discontent get sown.\n\u2022 How child getting a life-threatening diagnosis affects our view of god.\n\u2022 How negative life situations, disillusionment, and mourning the loss of our dreams can help plant seeds of doubt.\n\u2022 The strange experience of realizing that stepping away from Christianity is healthier than being in it.\n\u2022 The difference that support groups make to the deconversion process.\n\u2022 Realizing, after deconversion, that Christianity is truly a cult.\n\u2022 Moving past deconversion to being able to assist others with the healing process.\n\u2022 The pain, trauma, and isolation that occurs after the disillusion of our Christian beliefs and Christian identity.\n\u2022 The losses that occur from walking away from the faith ideologies of our families and communities.\n\u2022 How to build a secular life that is healthy, happy, and fulfilling.\n\u2022 Balancing freedom and responsibility after we deconvert.\n\u2022 How to deal with Christians who remain insensitive and who cannot understand the grieving process of those who deconvert.\n\u2022 The importance of having someone to talk through the post-deconversion season.\n\u2022 How to address triggers that come to deconverted Christians from Christians who have not deconverted yet.\n\u2022 How religion causes us to give up our autonomy and agency.\n\u2022 The importance of protecting our mental health.\n\u2022 The tendency to leave fundamental Christianity but not leave a fundamentalism mindset, where we feel the need to \u0022make others pay\u0022 when they don\u0027t think just like us.\n\u2022 The importance of those of us who have already deconverted to help those who are being disenfranchised.\n\u2022 How tragedy works to shake people free from their cognitive dissonance and to give people permission and courage to doubt.\n\u2022 The importance of graciousness as we realize that other people are trying very hard to protect their fragile belief system and to protect their worldview at all costs.\n\u2022 How, to a fundamentalist, any cause can seem like a holy cause, if we\u0027re desperate enough\n\u2022 The importance of focusing our energy mostly on helping those who are deconverting, instead of on fighting with fundamentalists.\n\u2022 How indoctrinating children into Christianity is a form of psychological abuse, and how Christian doctrines prey on children\u0027s best instincts.\n\u2022 The importance of stopping the group religious delusions of Christianity that have saturated in our culture.\n\u2022 How Christianity preys on the vulnerable and becomes a replacement addiction for their other addictions.\n\u2022 The importance of honoring our grief, and of learning to rebuild ourselves and reclaim our identity after deconversion.\n\u2022 Getting the right tools to thrive in the next chapter of life after deconversion.\n \n\nMany thanks to Janice for sharing her story, as well as for her amazing work as she helps the community at large, as well as individuals, in the deconstruction and healing journey.  I look forward to speaking with Janice again and hearing more of her heart in these crucial arenas.\n \n\n______________________________________\n\n\nMentioned in the interview\nhttps://www.divorcing-religion.com/\n\n\nLeaving the Fold by Marlene Winell\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Marlene-Winell/e/B001K8BI7U\n\n\nThe 5 Levels of Attachment\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Five-Levels-Attachment-Toltec-Wisdom-ebook/dp/B00BEPB004/\n\n\nConnect with Janice on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/Wise_counsellor\nhttps://twitter.com/divorcereligion\n\n\nJanice\u0027s YT page\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxcCYdtSFUDK896rMRi7J_w/featured\n\n\nThe CORT Facebook page\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ConferenceOnReligiousTrauma/\n\n____________________________________\n\nYour support for my channel is appreciated. \n--Tim\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist",

      "description": "Today I spoke with Neil Bernstein, a.k.a. \u0022Neil the 604 Atheist.\u0022\n\nWe had a casual chat about various topics, including:\n\n\u2022 His childhood, growing up in a moderately Jewish home.\n\u2022 The path of questioning former beliefs. \n\u2022 Giving up on the idea of an all-powerful deity.\n\u2022 The bizarre morality and atrocities of the Bible.\n\u2022 The fact of evolution.\n\u2022 The realization that this life is \u0022it\u0022 and that we won\u0027t be reunited with people in some kind of afterlife.\n\u2022 How comparative mythology helps in the deconstruction process.\n\u2022 How recent American politics is giving people more reasons to escape the Christian worldview.\n\u2022 The dynamics of religious shunning.\n\u2022 How to help others on their journey away from religion.\n\u2022 How to deal graciously with family and friends that are still stuck in theism.\n\u2022 How future technologies and scientific discoveries could help eliminate religion.\n\u2022 The need to empower more atheists to create a platform and use their voices to make a difference.\n\n\nMany thanks to Neil for sharing some of his story with me today.  I applaud him very highly for the tremendous efforts he puts into helping those who are deconstructing, and to the atheist community as a whole.\n\n\n__________________________________\n\nNeil the 604 Atheist\u0027s YT channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOkKPs3juZb9iwFn7Z29-Lw\n\n__________________________________\n\n\nMentioned in our interview:\nhttps://mjl.clarivate.com/home\n\n\nTrueNorth Talk\u0027s YT channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNfxQd9br_C-u06pTzu1Y1Q\n\n\nAnthony Magnobasco\u0027s YT channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCocP40a_UvRkUAPLD5ezLIQ\n\n\nCordial Curiosity\u0027s YT channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiWKxPMKUBFjN3Ny_VxpkYw\n\n\nThe book \u0022Alpha God\u0022\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Alpha-God-Psychology-Religious-Oppression/dp/1633880206\n\n\nThe Non-Prophets YT channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYKh0dYF1LfSTs0pjUb5rcQ\n\n\nLaughing in Disbelief YT channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDJYlFBEwFT52u1ja7uFWtw\n\n\n____________________________________\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.

      "description": "Today I spoke with Summer Biby, a mother of four and fellow YouTuber who grew up in Pentecostal Christianity but eventually deconverted after diving into the philosophical and historical issues of the Bible and the Christian worldview.\n\nWe discussed many aspects of Summer\u0027s story, from upbringing through deconversion, touching on many topics along the way, including:\n\n\u2022 The reality distortions propagated by Pentecostalism.\n\u2022 The negative influence of King James Only-ism.\n\u2022 The very shaky ground of canonicity and church \u0022history\u0022.\n\u2022 Growing up fearful of dying with unconfessed sin that could \u0022condemn us to hell.\u0022\n\u2022 The cracks in the theological structures we Christians grew up with.\n\u2022 The teaching on depravity that is behind our need for the \u0022gospel.\u0022\n\u2022 How Christian parents sow in their kids\u0027 hearts the untruth that they are intrinsically broken.\n\u2022 How Christianity creates feelings of failure in believers, and then preys on those feelings.\n\u2022 How Christianity teaches people to interpret internal dialogue and intuition as the Holy Spirit talking to us.\n\u2022 Realizing that we have nothing to be \u0022saved\u0022 from.\n\u2022 The horror of the god character who creates people knowing they will be tortured forever in hell.\n\u2022 The bizarreness of clear teachings in the Bible that say God has favorites, i.e., people he has picked and loved, and others he has not picked and therefore hated.\n\u2022 The origins of the Yahweh character and the strangeness of his capricious jealousy.\n\u2022 Being sheltered from reading non-Christian books during childhood.\n\u2022 How Christianity borrowed from many other religions during its creation and evolution.\n\u2022 The bizarreness of blood magic and of why it was acceptable to believe in \u0022drinking his blood.\u0022\n\u2022 How we see other gods as strange but ours as normal.\n\u2022 The realization that \u0022if others are indoctrinated, maybe I got indoctrinated too.\u0022\n\u2022 How charismatic Christianity preys on people\u0027s desire to feel something special from god\n\u2022 How Christianity preys on the needy\n\u2022 How difficult it is to leave the community that you were deeply plugged into in Christianity.\n\u2022 The negative effects of the purity culture and shame culture.\n\u2022 The Christian dynamic of telling women they are responsible to diminish their curves and demeanor to not distract and tempt men.\n\u2022 How deconversion hits us in waves as we realize the ways that theism has defined many parts of our worldview, and how we get to realize reality is entirely different than our old Christian construct.\n\u2022 How Christians cherry pick topics in the Bible to obey and not obey, based on what is culturally acceptable.\n\u2022 Realizing that religion is just the story of humans trying to figure out who god is--if there were a god--and not actually the story of any real god.\n\u2022 How the church uses scare tactics, such as fear of god \u0022cursing\u0022 us, to get people to fall in line with their authority.\n\u2022 Losing the fear of the pretend deity.\n\u2022 How to study our way out of faith.\n\u2022 The powerlessness of the Bible and of the Christian message.\n\u2022 Learning to stop seeing people as projects to fix and \u0022save.\u0022\n\u2022 How the synoptic problem of the gospels helps us see that the Bible has errors in it.\n\u2022 How Christianity tries to teach its adherents to use circular reasoning.\n\u2022 Being ok with not knowing all the answers.\n\u2022 How deconversion from Christianity helps us to live in the moment and appreciate our lives more.\n\u2022 How deconverting is like waking up from a bad dream.\n\u2022 The need for slow and thorough healing from religious trauma and deception.\n\u2022 The general dynamic of recovering from a religious worldview, and rebuilding from the ground up.\n\n\nThanks to Summer for her great contributions on her Youtube channel, and for sharing her heart in these matters during our interview today.

Throughout our conversation, Dr. Mason provides valuable insights about what conclusions may be warranted and which are assumptions, providing valuable guidance for how to stay on track as students of history.\n\nMany thanks to Dr. Mason for his lifelong contributions toward Josephus studies, and for his presentation here today.

She is the author of \u0022Trusting Doubt: A Former Evangelical Looks at Old Beliefs in a New Light,\u0022 as well as two other books.\n\nWe talked briefly about her background, and then moved through various topics, including:\n\n\u2022 How the Christian experience eventually feels like you\u0027re holding your beliefs together with \u0022duct tape and bailing wire.\u0022\n\u2022 How Christians try to gaslight those who deconvert by saying they hadn\u0027t actually been Christians or weren\u0027t truly committed to Jesus.\n\u2022 The distastefulness, abusiveness, and self-serving ideas that stem from the belief that suffering is from god and should be seen as a good thing\n\u2022 The common experience Christians have of repeatedly asking Jesus to save them, just to be sure it was real.\n\u2022 How the ideas of personal failure, helplessness, self-recrimination, and judgment get bound up in the Gospel message of \u0022divine love.\u0022\n\u2022 How Christian theology triggers people who struggle with post-traumatic stress from their time brainwashed by Christian theology.\n\u2022 How teaching kids about demons is like teaching them that there are monsters in the closet.\n\u2022 How teaching kids about the end times/rapture concepts often instills in them a fear that they will be \u0022left behind\u0022 in this world.\n\u2022 Dealing with the fear of \u0022hell.\u0022\n\u2022 The leaps of logic and tweaking of reality that are part of the Christian worldview, which ultimately help us see its bizarreness.\n\u2022 Dealing with our imperfect human processing and flaws in our ability to discern what is true.\n\u2022 The real-world contingencies that govern our well-being.\n\u2022 Confirmatory thinking and cognitive dissonance.\n\u2022 The cultishness of Christianity.\n\u2022 How compassion for others and anger over theodicy were core factors in her deconversion.\n\u2022 The inexcusable cruelties of the Bible\u0027s Yahweh character.\n\u2022 How to not \u0022miss having a god\u0022 once we realize that the story is fabricated and mythological.\n\u2022 How to help others work through religious indoctrination and trauma.\n\u2022 The horrific idea that Christians in heaven will be blissfully indifferent to the torture happening in \u0022hell.\u0022\n\n\nThanks to Dr. Tarico for her strong voice in these subjects, and for the ways she passionately makes a difference in our culture, as well as in the experience of individuals who are working through their deconversion and the process of creating of a healthy worldview.\n\n_______________________________\n\nDr. Tarico\u0027s website is:\nhttps://valerietarico.com/\n\n\nCheck out Dr. Tarico\u0027s books:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Valerie-Tarico/e/B0032MSJRE\nand\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/list/112322.Valerie_Tarico\n\n_______________________________\n\nReferenced in this video:\n\nAndy Thompson, Why We Believe in gods:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iMmvu9eMrg\nand\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRfUJDWUUGk\n\n\nWelcome To The Cult Factory: A Conversation with Tristan Harris, by Sam Harris\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1se6POdUcWM\n\n_______________________________\n\n** Apologies for the few minutes where the video and audio are slightly out of sync.\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nPlease subscribe to my other channels:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@HarmonicNatureAmbience/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@HarmonicRefuge/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@HarmonicRefugeASMR\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      https://paypal.me/harmonicatheist\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n\n_________________________________________",

      "description": "Today I was honored to speak with Bill Zuersher, author of the book \u0022Seeing Through Christianity: A Critique of Beliefs and Evidence,\u0022 and one of the people who had a profound influence on my deconversion from Christianity.\n\nBill\u0027s passion stems from his observation of the ways that American culture has drifted to allow Christianity to occupy a prominent and privileged position in the public square--versus maintaining a strong separation of Church and State.  That dynamic motivated Bill to speak up and make a difference, primary by exposing the true origins of Judaism and Christianity, which are unknown to many.\n\nWe touched on his unique experience growing up in a Christian home with a Lutheran father and a Christian Scientist mother, and went on to talk through many topics Bill is passionate about, such as:\n\n\u2022 Addressing the deep philosophical questions of life\n\u2022 The ways that mythology has been institutionalized\n\u2022 How to help people widen the lens of how they see the information regarding the origins of Christianity\n\u2022 How the Bible\u0027s authors wrote stories after an event occurred and then claimed to have written a prophecy that got fulfilled\n\u2022 The evolution of the Yahweh character\n\u2022 The idea that \u0022The smarter you are, the more clever the excuses you can make for the things you already believe\u0022\n\u2022 The power of worldview, and of what we unwittingly accept as axiomatic.\n\u2022 How there were so many legends added to the Jesus story from the beginning that it\u0027s hard to tell which parts of the story have any basis in history\n\u2022 How many other stories of other gods and mystery religions of that time were very similar to Christianity\n\u2022 The evolution of Judaism and Christianity\n\u2022 The apostle Paul\u0027s role in creating Christianity\n\u2022 Presuppositionalism and the transcendental argument for god\n\nMany thanks to Bill for his life-changing effect on my life, and for his impact in providing critical information about the pagan origins and mythological content of the Christian worldview.\n\n___________________________________\n\nThe video of Bill\u0027s presentation that we mentioned several times in our interview:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AdPoHDebjU\n\nBill Zuersher\u0027s website:\nhttps://www.seeingthroughchristianity.com/\n\nThe highlighted page on his website that he mentioned:\nhttps://www.seeingthroughchristianity.com/polytheism-in-the-old-testament/\n\nBill Zuersher\u0027s Youtube channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3-Jn6x9rtH9wHeHSt04TXw/videos\n\n______________________________________\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.  \nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nThe more support I receive, the sooner I can do this full time!\n--Tim",

      "description": "Today I was delighted to speak with Sara Martin, a musician and fellow Youtuber.  We discussed her journey growing up as a Christian, heavily exposed to Gospel messages and calls to ministry, attending a Christian college and going on mission trips, but eventually deconstructing her faith and deconverting from Christianity.\n\nThroughout our discussion, we touched on:\n\n\u2022 The general Christian goal of getting to heaven, and before that, living a life with god at the center, and fulfilling his plans for our lives.\n\u2022 The Christian focus on being intentional and on fire for Christ, to not live an average life for God, and to make an impact for the kingdom of god.\n\u2022 Struggling with self-esteem, even while knowing god loves us\n\u2022 The perpetual guilt of not measuring up, not praying enough, etc.\n\u2022 How Christianity becomes part of your identity, to the point that it is painful to disconnect from it when you eventually realize it\u0027s mythology, and deconvert.\n\u2022 The psychology of Christian ideas.\n\u2022 The ways that Christian college and missions trips can lead to deconversion, as they create disillusionment over the Christian worldview\u2019s poor answers to life\u2019s questions.\n\u2022 The dynamic of Christians convincing themselves that they are sensing God\u0027s strength in situations that were really difficult, that god\u2019s work was evident in their lives (\u0022that was a god thing\u0022), and how that causes Christians to look for \u201Cgod moments,\u201D and \u201Cgod signs,\u201D such as seeing god in rainbows, special cloud formations, life situations.\n\u2022 How Christians assure themselves that they feel their god\u0027s peace and presence.\n\u2022 How Christians think that their god is opening doors, but how that perspective falls apart badly as life situations don\u2019t work out well at all.\n\u2022 How it \u0022wears you out\u0022 to live with the cognitive dissonance of Christianity, and how critical it is to prioritize our own mental well-being over that cognitive dissonance.\n\u2022 Walking through deconstruction alone, not having safe places to talk about it and to ask honest questions about faith.\n\u2022 The guilt and fear people grapple with over losing their faith, not wanting to be a heretic.\n\u2022 How Christian faith falls apart.\n\u2022 What it\u2019s like to finally allowing ourselves to admit Christianity\u2019s not real, to go \u0022over the edge\u0022 and admit you no longer believe.\n\u2022 Grappling with the idea that god has a plan for people\u0027s lives, even in contexts where entire generations faced genocide and extreme poverty.\n\u2022 The ways that the purity culture shames people and drowns them in legalism and guilt.\n\u2022 The unhealthiness of the Christian view of sexuality, the dangers of the ultra-modesty culture, how the desire for sexual pleasure is normal and appropriate, and how sex before marriage is not \u201Csinful.\u201D\n\u2022 How Christianity deprives us of the ability to thrive.\n\u2022 The hypocritical Christian message of god loves us, he hates us, and thus \u201CI love myself, I hate myself.\u201D\n\u2022 Giving ourselves the right to say when something sounds wrong and no longer accepting pat answers.\n\u2022 Pursuing the truth, wherever it leads us.\n\u2022 The importance of living an authentic life.\n\u2022 The final steps of deconversion.\n\u2022 Walking away from Christianity and our \u0022relationship\u0022 with Jesus.\n\u2022 How Christianity is about blood magic and scapegoating.\n\u2022 Why it makes no sense that \u0022the soul that sins must die\u0022 versus just being forgiven.\n\u2022 How bizarre the Bible is in light of its messages of genocide, slavery, misogyny, the psychopathic deity character, etc.\n\u2022 How deconversion brings more peace than being a Christian.\n\u2022 After deconversion, being able for the first time to see people for who they really are.\n \nThanks to Sara for sharing her story here today, and in more detail on her channel.

      "description": "Today I spoke with David LeBlanc about his story of walking away from Christianity when he realized that its fundamental claims are deeply flawed.\n\nWe discussed his deconstruction journey, starting with growing up Catholic, then moving into Protestantism via a Calvinistic church, then Calvary Chapel, and lastly into Messianic Judaism, before deconverting.\n\nWe dove into many parts of his story, focusing on topics related to deconstruction, such as: \n\n\u2022 The hypocrisy of the Catholic church.\n\u2022 The ludicrous nature of the doctrines of blood magic and the Trinity.\n\u2022 The discrepancies in the Bible.\n\u2022 The quasi-intellectual side of Christianity.\n\u2022 How religious groups see many critical questions as \u201Coff limits,\u201D and why it\u2019s important to ask the hard questions, despite push-back.\n\u2022 The unspoken social construct in religious circles that followers must accept the narrative, even when it doesn\u0027t make sense.\n\u2022 How increasingly extreme religious beliefs drive people to get involved in ministry \u002B how imitation of Jesus and a call to be ultra-committed to him pulls people to more extremist lifestyles as proof of discipleship.\n\u2022 The Christian call to \u201CCome under authority,\u201D \u201CSuffer for Christ and the Gospel,\u201D and \u201CTo not seek your own glory.\u201D\n\u2022 How Christianity is a performance-based narrative, despite the surface message of grace.\n\u2022 How Christians will often oppose stories about magic and mythology, while concurrently embracing a book that is full of magic and mythology.\n\u2022 The triumphalist view of Christians that their interpretation of Jewish writings was more accurate than Jewish interpretations.\n\u2022 How the original Jesus movement leaders took Old Testament narratives and deceptively wrote the Jesus story to try to make it look like he had selectively fulfilled certain prophecies.\n\u2022 The Christian distortions around Jesus being the Messiah.\n\u2022 The arrogance of the mentality that \u0022We\u0027re right and everyone else is wrong.\u0022\n\u2022 How Christianity is a cult.\n\nThanks to David for sharing his story, including some of the more painful parts of it.  I appreciate your vulnerability.\n\n______________________________\n\n\nPlease visit David\u0027s Youtube channel!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM5QXJmec38cdwq3PI7nwUQ/videos\n\n______________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.  \nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nThe more support I receive, the sooner I can do this full time!\n--Tim",

      "description": "Today I spoke with Andrew Jasko, a seminary-educated minister who ultimately left his religious faith and community.  He is now focused on helping others heal from religious trauma.\n\nAndrew shared his background growing up in the Assemblies of God church and being groomed to become a minister and missionary.  He eventually questioned the content and philosophical implications of the Christian worldview and belief system, and deconverted.\n\nThroughout our discussion, we touched on:\n\n \u2022 The traumatic, bedrock fear of the unending torture of hell as the motivation behind Christianity.\n \u2022 How to unwind the indoctrination and fears.\n \u2022 The premise of human beings fundamentally wicked.\n \u2022 The \u0022identity theft\u0022 that occurs through religion and how it\u0027s difficult to see the psychopathic nature of the Yahweh character of the Old Testament when your identity is wrapped up in him, and the side effect of how those beliefs degrade our humanity.\n \u2022 The victim mentality and disempowered position that comes from seeing your identity, acceptance, safety, and power as coming from an outside source, through belief and obedience.\n \u2022 The danger of seeking solutions from a religious system, and of always concluding that the issue is ourselves, not our religious beliefs.\n \u2022 The idea that the Bible is a flawless communication from god, that you have to obey everything in it, and that you can\u0027t scrutinize and judge the god character.\n \u2022 Seeing sexuality as a curse where you are constantly trying to fight your urges.\n \u2022 Being programmed for severe repression on many levels.\n \u2022 The baseline of purity in thoughts and desires, especially in the area of sexuality, and the resulting guilt and shame trauma.\n \u2022 The Yahweh character being able to see every thought in our heads.\n \u2022 How religion enslaves us.\n \u2022 Outsourcing our power vs. standing in our own sovereignty.\n \u2022 The rude awakening of deconversion.\n \u2022 Committing ourselves to dealing directly with the bad ideas\n \u2022 Cultivating a non-judgmental, empathic awareness.\n \u2022 The psychology of believers, especially regarding the cognitive dissonance of Christianity.\n \u2022 How to approach theists who are stuck in an apologetics mindset.\n \u2022 Having grace with ourselves through the healing process, so that we truly give ourselves the time, freedom, and patience to heal.\n \u2022 Integrating all aspects of ourselves.\n \u2022 The role of religious trauma counseling, as well as meditation.\n \u2022 Non-dual humanism.\n\n\nThanks to Andrew for the many ways he helps others heal and reclaim their identity after religious indoctrination.\n\n__________________________________\n\n\nAndrew Jasko\u0027s website:\nhttps://lifeafterdogma.org/\n\nFacebook page:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/lifeafterdogma/\n\n** To schedule an Inner Breakthrough Session with Andrew and see whether the Healing from Religious Trauma Coaching Program is a fit for you, go to:\nhttps://innerfreedomsession.as.me/\n\n______________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.  \nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nThe more support I receive, the sooner I can do this full time!\n--Tim",

      "description": "Today I spoke with Tammie Willis, who shared her story of growing up in the Independent Fundamental Baptist Church cult.  She described the ways that the church psychologically abuses people, especially children, as it tries to indoctrinate them into the mythology of Christianity.\n\nWe discussed the negative results of the purity culture movement, and touched on the ways that threatening kids with hell and instilling in them a fear of the end times, i.e., being \u0022left behind,\u0022 creates an extremely toxic environment.  We zoomed out a bit as well to talk about the larger context of how the church blinds people people from critical information and alternative perspectives, and ultimately impairs people\u0027s ability to think critically and keeps them from questioning the Judeo-Christian narrative.\n\nWe moved on to discuss how ongoing experiences with Christians can trigger those of us who have escaped, and how we should deal with those situations and emotions, as well as the broader issue of healing from religious trauma.\n\nWe ended by talking about the beauty of life without religion, about the joy of embracing reality, and about how to reframe the narrative of our lives once we are free from the Christian cult environment.\n\nThanks to Tammie for her vulnerability and power in sharing her story and helping others to think through these critical issues, as they reclaim their life and identity.\n\n**This video was taken before Christmas, but due to my backlog in processing videos, I am posting it later than anticipated.\n\n_____________________________\n\n\nPlease check out some of Tammie\u0027s other interviews, such as:\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/indoctrinationshow/thought-stopping-techniques-wtammie-willis\n\n(or, through Apple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/thought-stopping-techniques-w-tammie-willis/id1373939526?i=1000493081523)\n\nhttps://generationcult.com/2019/11/01/the-newest-episode-of-generation-cult-faith-based-fear-is-out-now/\n\n______________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.  \nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nThe more support I receive, the sooner I can do this full time!\n--Tim",

We walked through the ways her personal background and professional experience provided a backdrop for her to speak to and help others walk through the dynamics of healing from religious trauma.\n\nWe touched on how people learn to move past toxic religious ideas and theology as they process the feelings of deconversion and heal from the scars.  We talked through how we learn to trust ourselves and acknowledge that we aren\u0027t bad just because we don\u0027t subscribe to the mythology of Christianity.\n\nWe ended by talking about the ways that childhood indoctrination into Christianity is abusive, especially as it creates a trapped feeling in children, where they are forced to believe and follow certain rules, despite the profound damage it does and the cognitive dissonance it requires.\n\nThank you, Dr. Winell, for sharing some of your story as well as your passion and skill for walking people out of the darkness of religion, and into the resulting healing, peace, personal growth, and thriving that occurs.

We walked through his childhood and young adulthood, which were passionately focused on the Bible, the Gospel, ministry, and missions.\n\nTyler shared how his time with New Tribes Mission / Ethnos 360 created an environment in which various classes, experiences, and theological issues led him to deconstruct his faith, and to eventually--and joyfully--leave Christianity behind.\n\nWe discussed some of the difficult memories regarding how Tyler was treated in the Christianity community as a gay man, and how he has learned to express even more grace with others as a result.\n\nMy time chatting with Tyler was one of my most memorable interviews so far.  His sincerity, kindness, gentleness, introspection, maturity, patience, and core value of building relationships were humbling, and a breathe of fresh air.\n\nThanks to Tyler for sharing his journey with openness and bravery.

      "description": "Today I spoke with David Rich, author of books such as \u0022Myths of the Tribe\u0022 and \u0022Scribes of the Tribe.\u0022\n\nDavid and I took some time to discuss his early exit from Christianity.  He recognized as a very young man that the Christian worldview is full of fraudulent, misleading claims, that it is psychologically abusive, and that it prevents people from seeing reality, and instead provides a social construct bubble that is difficult to leave.  We discussed how myths can hamper reason and incite violence.\n\nIn his book \u0022Myths of the Tribe,\u0022 David promotes a rational analysis of all problems in the light of objective scientific evidence, a system of ethics that allows complete individual liberty constrained only by the principle of harming no one else, taking personal responsibility for one\u2019s own welfare and actions, and the absence of government control over the pursuit of happiness.  In his book \u0022Scribes of the Tribe,\u0022 David shares insights from great thinkers throughout the ages.\n\nThanks to David for his writing and speaking, and for his efforts for the atheist community.\n\n__________________________\n\n\nYou can read more about and purchase David\u0027s books here:\nhttps://www.booksforatheists.com/\n\nYou can see some of David\u0027s road trip stories and photos here:\nhttps://www.gonomad.com/author/david-rich\nand\nhttp://www.mytripjournal.com/RichWorld?fbclid=IwAR0k_lkcGJVLKcNly7CnU8pr-6GC6AS30EP9GUUo1Ls5_twaK1jZdBzSd-A\nand\nhttps://fineartamerica.com/profiles/david-rich\n\n______________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.  \nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nThe more support I receive, the sooner I can do this full time!\n--Tim",

Jason does an amazing job revealing the origins of many of the stories and characters we read about in the Bible, and how they were copied and syncretized into Judaism and Christianity.\n\nJason shared his background growing up as a Catholic, especially walking through the various ways the Catholic Church instills guilt and shame on its members.  \n\nWe touched on his deconversion from Christianity throughout the video, but a large portion of our video focused on Jason\u0027s lifelong struggle with depression and suicide.  Jason\u0027s openness and vulnerability are touching and inspiring.  Jason shared the ways he invents and fuels his purpose and motivation.\n\nWe left a lot of questions on the table, so we\u0027ll be touching base again soon to dig into them.\n\nThanks to Jason for his story, work, partnership, and mostly just for being his awesome self!

We briefly touched on her eventual deconversion from Christianity, and the beautiful effects of her exit.\n\nDr. Collins and I spent quite a while discussing the damage that the Christian worldview does to people, ranging from instilling a horrible self-image, to the shame/blame culture, to the promotion of a psychopathic deity character that Christians are taught to to accept and defend.\n\nThanks to Dr. Collins for her story, her insights, and her willingness to speak strongly about these issues.\n\n__________________________________\n\nDr. Collins\u0027 blog may be found here:\nhttps://saoirsewindsong.wordpress.com/\n\nPlease check out Dr. Collins\u0027 Youtube videos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpHBQ07_W5mj_CjDSZ7cdZw/videos\n\nDr. Collins also recently appeared on the MythVision channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaB-NKcElXQ\n\nDr. Collins\u0027 books are available on Amazon:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/s?i=stripbooks\u0026rh=p_27%3ASaoirse\u002BWindsong\u002BCollins\u002BPhD\u0026s=relevancerank\u0026text=Saoirse\u002BWindsong\u002BCollins\u002BPhD\u0026ref=dp_byline_sr_book_2\n\n______________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.  \nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nThe more support I receive, the sooner I can do this full time!\n--Tim",

We walked through the ways we both had tried to defend, excuse, and reconcile the bizarre, cultish beliefs of Christianity, instead of seeing it as it is: the blood magic death cult focused on human sacrifice, scapegoating, and hell.\n\nWe talked about the Bible\u0027s message of humanity\u0027s sinfulness, about constantly trying to please a pretend god, and about how some people may be intellectually ready to let go of religious ideas, but still not emotionally ready.  We also touched on the residual effects of having previously been a Christian, and how we have to give ourselves the patience and grace to learn how to embrace reality, love others, redeem our time, and live our lives without Christian mythology.\n\nWe discussed how to support others wherever they are in their journey, and giving people space and sensitivity to think through these issues and investigate for themselves the origins of the Bible and Christianity.\n\nWe wrapped up talking about the dangers of psychological abuse of childhood indoctrination into Christianity, and about the importance of raising kids without a mythological worldview and a fear of a mythological hell.\n\nMany thanks for Maria for her openness and vulnerability in our interview, and for the other subjects she covers on her own channel.\n\n\n__________________________\n\n\nMaria\u0027s Youtube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEU4E6IRIfgIu4IVG4QvLNQ\n\nMaria\u0027s wedding photography site:\nhttps://www.thegernands.com/\n\n__________________________\n\n\nIn our chat, we mentioned the Theramin Trees Youtube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/TheraminTrees/videos\n\n______________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.  \nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nThe more support I receive, the sooner I can do this full time!\n--Tim",

Mike is a researcher focused on the historicity and reliability of the Bible, especially the Gospel narratives.   He is also an activist, focused on trying to expose and stop the damage done by compulsory childhood religious indoctrination.\n\nWe discussed the historicity--or lack thereof--for Jesus, and what was going on at that time in history, especially the Temple destruction, that caused various Jewish sects to need to come up with an alternative way to deal with sin that still focused on blood magic atonement.\n\n\nOur discussion was fascinating, and we touched on many topics, including astrotheology, religious brainwashing, and ending with some counsel for Christians who are on the verge of deconverting, who are realizing and admitting to themselves that it is mythology.\n\n\nThanks to Mike for his strong voice in these discussions.  He has been an inspiration to me, and I deeply appreciate his work and his clarity of thought as he presents many years\u0027 worth of research.\n\nBy the way, the painting I used in the background for the video was painted by Mike himself!\n\n____________________________________\n\n\nMike Lawrence\u0027s website is:\nhttp://www.notori.co.uk/\n\n\nMike\u0027s newest book, 70, may be purchased here:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Seventy-Reverse-Construction-Thesis-Christians-ebook/dp/B087QQ8J9K/\n\n\nMike\u0027s Youtube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/NOTORIUK/videos\n\n\nSome of his other interviews may be seen here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/TalkBeliefs/search?query=mike%20lawrence\n\n______________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.  \nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nThe more support I receive, the sooner I can do this full time!\n--Tim",

      "description": "Today I was honored again to speak with Dr. Steve Mason, Distinguished Professor of Ancient Mediterranean Religions and Cultures at the University of Groningen.\n\nDr. Mason and I addressed several aspects of Jesus Mythicism, which I deeply appreciated.  We touched on the absence of historical information about Jesus in the letters of Paul, and whether Paul is anticipating the first, or second, coming of Jesus, in 1 Thessalonians 4:13-17.\n\nWe praised the voices in the Mythicist-Historicist conversation that are bringing valuable and insightful information to the forefront.  We also agreed that we all need to focus on mutual respect as we find points where we disagree, or areas where each of us chooses to focus our research. \n\nUltimately, we agree that whether there was \u0022a guy\u0022 at the start of Christianity, it is heavily built up with legend and mythology that needs to be studied and understood, in its proper context, in order to understand the origins of Christianity.\n\nWe also discussed Josephus, but saved a discussion on the Testimonium Flavinium for another time.  During today\u0027s conversation about Josephus, we focused on:\n\n--James the brother of Jesus\n--The ways that the author of the Gospel of Luke knew and used two of Josephus\u0027 books: Jewish War, and Jewish Antiquities.\n\nDr. Mason\u0027s expertise and insights regarding the Bible, Josephus, Jesus, and the cultures of that time are enlightening, and his desire to bring balance to these discussions shines through.  He always does an excellent job at explaining the role of a historian when investigating early Christianity. \n\nThanks again to Dr. Mason for his time.  I excitedly look forward to a discussion on the Testimonium Flavinium in the future!\n\n______________________________________\n\n\nDr. Mason\u0027s books may be purchased here:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Steve-Mason/e/B01HVVIDJK\n\nDr. Mason\u0027s page on the University of Groningen website is:\nhttps://www.rug.nl/staff/s.mason/\n\n______________________________________\n\nOur prior interview may be seen here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKcMlufpieA\n\n______________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.  \nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nThe more support I receive, the sooner I can do this full time!\n--Tim",

Jonathan blogs on a page called \u0022A Tippling Philosopher.\u0022\n\nWe touched on Jonathan\u0027s childhood journey with Christianity, and then spent a large portion of our chat going over highlights from several of his books.  Some of the topics we touched on include the psychology of religion, how small nudges add up to worldview changes, and the importance of libertarian free will.\n\nWe wrapped up talking about how to go beyond the facts and philosophies that cause deconversion, to the dynamics of truly processing and understanding the human experience and emotions of deconversion.\n\nJonathan\u0027s stories, his brilliant thought processes, and his contagious sense of humor are truly delightful to listen to and interact with.

We met in kindergarten, and remained good friends for many years as we attended Christian school together, where part of our indoctrination occurred.  We were also heavily involved in Bible quizzing, when we memorized hundreds of verses.\n\nWe discussed Susan\u0027s deconversion from Christianity, including the ways that the Christian worldview--especially the fundamentalist Christian one--hurts and emotionally scars people who grow up in it.  We talked about the cracks that appear early in life, which are painful to work through, but which ultimately help people to think more rationally, to realize that Christianity is mythology and that the Christian god is not actually real, and to truly begin to live their lives for the first time.\n\nThanks to Susan for her vulnerability, realness, wisdom, sensitivity, and love for life.\n\n\n______________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.  \nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nThe more support I receive, the sooner I can do this full time!\n--Tim",

We chatted about what it means to be on a path of rationality vs. blind acceptance of what we were taught as children.\n\nWe will check back in from time to time, by video interviews, with updates on our journeys.\n\n\n______________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.  \nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nThe more support I receive, the sooner I can do this full time!\n--Tim",
