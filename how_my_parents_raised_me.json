      "description": "This week my guest is Kendra Petty, the author of I Can\u0027t Believe I\u0027m Not Dead: Escaping Abuse, a Cult, Attempted Murder and Other Insanities. Kendra\u2019s story involves terrible abuse at the hands of her mother in a very toxic childhood home. Kendra\u2019s mother was deeply religious and eventually started a cult, preaching the word of god, whilst continuing to physically abuse Kendra until she was 18 years old. When Kendra was finally able to move away, the deep programming from an abusive parent continued to send Kendra into more and more situations of abuse throughout her life. An abusive marriage and an attempted poisoning by an employer leading to Graves Disease and a cancer diagnosis are just a part of this story. Kendra is an absolute THRIVER and you will hear about Kendra\u0027s decision that it was time to stop living in fear and create a life she desired for herself. You must get Kendra\u2019s book to hear the full story.
