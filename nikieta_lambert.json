If you feel yourself getting triggered, please pause to be able to process and reset. \n\n\n1- We warned you there may be profanity, but there is none! \n2- We have laid eyes on the Hampton Roads response to the rolling stones article. It includes the following verbiage:\n\u0022The leadership of the HRC takes these accusations and others like them seriously. If childhood sexual abuse is reported to any of our staff members, our process includes reporting the incident to legal authorities, as required by the laws of the state of Virginia. If any member has knowledge of childhood sexual abuse or any other criminal activity in the HRC, we encourage them to discuss it with a staff member or elder. At present we are not aware of any childhood sexual abuse incidents in the HRC or other churches in the ACR or in the ICOC churches.\u0022 \n\nand\n\n\u0022We also anticipate that those who have previously written or posted negative opinions about the ICOC churches may use the article to further their discussions on social media. We would encourage you to not get involved in arguments based on speculation and rumor, online or otherwise. Instead, we encourage you to pray for all involved in the lawsuits and for the church and its leadership to respond with love and wisdom.\u0022\n\nSo......there you go.",
