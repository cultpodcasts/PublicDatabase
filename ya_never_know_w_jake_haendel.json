      "description": "This episode picks up where Part One left off \u2014 after Daniella\u2019s daring escape from the Children of God cult. What came next was a new kind of structure, discipline, and control: the U.S. military. Daniella (@daniellamyoung_) opens up about serving two tours in military intelligence, the psychological aftermath of leaving one cult only to find herself in another, and how she ultimately reclaimed her freedom and voice. Her bestselling memoir, Uncultured: A Memoir (available everywhere), tells the story of her journey from indoctrination to independence. Her forthcoming book, The Culting of America (available now for pre-sale at knittingcultlady.com), explores how cult dynamics appear in modern society. This is Part Two \u2014 powerful, revealing, and impossible to forget.",

      "description": "This episode dives into a story so wild it sounds like fiction \u2014 but it\u2019s all very real. Daniella, also known as the knitting cult lady, was born into Children of God as a third-generation member. From birth, she suffered control, abuse, and was even trafficked across borders under the guise of loyalty to the cult. What makes her story even more extraordinary is how she broke free. As a teenager she escaped, built a new life for herself, and later served in the U.S. military. Her resilience led her to become an author. Her first memoir, Uncultured: A Memoir (available now) ( bookshop.org ) reflects on her journey through indoctrination and freedom. Her second book, The Culting of America, is currently on pre-sale (ships January 20, 2026) ( knittingcultlady.com ) and examines cult behavior in modern society. Follow Daniella on Instagram: @daniellamyoung_ This is Part One of her escape \u2014 raw, gripping, and full of revelations.",
