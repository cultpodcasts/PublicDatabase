      "description": "This episode dives into a story so wild it sounds like fiction \u2014 but it\u2019s all very real. Daniella, also known as the knitting cult lady, was born into Children of God as a third-generation member. From birth, she suffered control, abuse, and was even trafficked across borders under the guise of loyalty to the cult. What makes her story even more extraordinary is how she broke free. As a teenager she escaped, built a new life for herself, and later served in the U.S. military. Her resilience led her to become an author. Her first memoir, Uncultured: A Memoir (available now) ( bookshop.org ) reflects on her journey through indoctrination and freedom. Her second book, The Culting of America, is currently on pre-sale (ships January 20, 2026) ( knittingcultlady.com ) and examines cult behavior in modern society. Follow Daniella on Instagram: @daniellamyoung_ This is Part One of her escape \u2014 raw, gripping, and full of revelations.",
