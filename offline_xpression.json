      "title": "From Religious Cult to Live TV Director: The Logan Dean Story",
      "description": "Dean Logan grew up in a religious cult where he couldn\u0027t watch sports, eat chocolate, celebrate holidays, or go to gym class. He was bullied relentlessly, became suicidal at 17, joined the Air Force to escape, survived two tours in Iraq, came home with PTSD, went through a divorce, hit rock bottom drunk at 3AM in Belgium, and then made a choice that changed everything. Today, Logan directs live television events for the biggest productions in the world: Super Bowls, World Series, French Opens, Wimbledon, Australian Opens. But more importantly, he\u0027s a Personal Integrated Growth Strategist who helps people break free from the limits they\u0027ve placed on themselves, because he knows what it\u0027s like to start from zero, work for free for six months, and rebuild your entire life from scratch. This episode is raw, real, and necessary. If you\u0027ve ever felt stuck, broken, or like your limit has already been decided for you, this conversation will prove otherwise. You\u0027ll Discover: \u25CF How growing up in a religious cult shaped Logan\u0027s mental resilience \u25CF Why Logan joined the Air Force (and the dream that didn\u0027t work out) \u25CF What active warfare does to your brain (7 attacks a day for 6 months) \u25CF How Logan got into live TV production (and why it started with theater) \u25CF What a live TV director actually does during a game \u25CF The career change gamble (30 years old, no network, $200 left) \u25CF Why \u0022your limit is a lie\u0022 (neuroscience meets military strategy) \u25CF The Personal Integrated Growth Strategist approach (multiple pillars of life) PLUS, we talk about the difference between falling and failing: Failing = never trying again, Falling = we do it all the time (expected) \u2728 Watch now! \u0026#x1f49b; Don\u0027t forget to subscribe for more heart-centered conversations about mental health, reclaiming attention, and navigating life offline!
