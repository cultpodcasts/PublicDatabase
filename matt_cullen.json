      "description": "What started as a spiritual wellness group turned into one of the most disturbing cults in modern history. In this episode, I dive into the chilling true story of Buddhafield and its leader, Jaime Gomez (also known as Michel, Andreas, and Reyji) who manipulated his followers with promises of enlightenment, love, and healing\u2026 while hiding a dark, abusive truth.\n\nFrom the cult\u2019s beginnings in 1980s West Hollywood to its eerie rebirth in Hawaii, this is a story of plastic surgery, power, psychological control\u2014and the shocking sexual abuse allegations that rocked this so-called spiritual paradise. If you\u2019ve seen the Holy Hell documentary, you know how disturbing it gets. But there\u2019s even more to this story that didn\u2019t make the final cut.\n\nAll the footage is pulled from the Holy Hell documentary.
