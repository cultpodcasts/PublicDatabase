      "title": "Prince Andrew\u2019s biographer - disgraced Duke of York should face trial",
      "description": "Following the news that Prince Andrew is to give up his titles and honours, after more damaging headlines about the extent of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and the publication of Virginia Giuffre\u2019s posthumous memoir, Andrew Lownie, the Prince\u2019s biographer, joins Camilla and Tim in the studio on today\u2019s Daily T. Lownie tells Camilla and Tim that he believes Prince William drove the move to Andrew relinquish his titles, in an attempt at damage control ahead of more potentially embarrassing revelations. He claims that it\u2019s \u201Ctoo little, too late\u201D and that he should have been stripped of his titles by parliamentary act if necessary, as \u201Cnothing much has actually changed\u201D. He also explains how the Prince\u2019s links to the Chinese spy scandal may have played a role in the decision, claiming his behaviour over the years can be explained by a childhood in which he was \u201Cshown no boundaries and no discipline\u201D. \u25BA Sign up to our most popular newsletter, From the Editor.

      "description": "As the row inside Reform rumbles on, Camilla speaks to the man behind the headlines: Rupert Lowe. In the wake of his blistering attack on his former ally Nigel Farage, Lowe tells The Daily T the Reform leader is \u201Crunning a cult\u201D and a \u201Cnarcissist\u201D. He also says he might start a new party to the right of Reform, calling for \u201Ca satisfactory alternative\u201D that is \u201Cmore than just a mobile PR machine\u201D. Later, we bring you part two of The Daily T\u2019s interview with veteran Tory MP and father of the house Sir Edward Leigh, who\u2019s leading the charge against the legalisation of assisted dying. Ahead of another debate by MPs on Friday, Sir Edward explains why he has joined forces with Labour grandee Diane Abbott in an attempt to halt the Bill\u2019s progress.
