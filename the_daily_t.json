      "description": "This episode was recorded before the release of the latest tranche of Jeffrey Epstein documents by Donald Trump\u2019s justice department\n\nThe Duke of York was stripped of his remaining royal titles, patronages and protections as damaging emails with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein came to light. His fall from grace culminated in the loss of royal property, while Sarah, Duchess of York, was once again pulled into a scandal she had long insisted was firmly in the past.\n\nThis was not just another crisis for the Royal Family. It marked the moment the House of York collapsed \u2014 exactly as foretold in royal biographer Andrew Lownie\u2019s explosive book, The Rise and Fall of the House of York.\n\nSo how did Prince Andrew\u2019s downfall finally unfold \u2014 and what does it mean for the future of the British monarchy in 2026?\n\nIn this episode, Camilla is joined by Andrew Lownie and Hannah Furness, Royal Editor of The Telegraph, to examine how Prince Andrew was stripped of his royal titles, the impact of Virginia Giuffre\u2019s posthumous memoir, the Palace\u2019s shifting strategy, and what \u2014 if any \u2014 future remains for the disgraced Duke of York.\n\nThe discussion also explores whether Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie have survived the fallout, contrasts Andrew\u2019s collapse with the cautious re-emergence of Prince Harry following a security ruling U-turn and a rare meeting with King Charles, and assesses the ongoing controversies surrounding Meghan Markle.\n\nFinally, the episode examines the growing influence of the Prince and Princess of Wales, the death of the Duchess of Kent, and whether a slimmed-down monarchy is now facing an existential crisis.\n\n\nWe want to hear from you!

      "description": "Following the news that Prince Andrew is to give up his titles and honours, after more damaging headlines about the extent of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and the publication of Virginia Giuffre\u2019s posthumous memoir, Andrew Lownie, the Prince\u2019s biographer, joins Camilla and Tim in the studio on today\u2019s Daily T. Lownie tells Camilla and Tim that he believes Prince William drove the move to Andrew relinquish his titles, in an attempt at damage control ahead of more potentially embarrassing revelations. He claims that it\u2019s \u201Ctoo little, too late\u201D and that he should have been stripped of his titles by parliamentary act if necessary, as \u201Cnothing much has actually changed\u201D. He also explains how the Prince\u2019s links to the Chinese spy scandal may have played a role in the decision, claiming his behaviour over the years can be explained by a childhood in which he was \u201Cshown no boundaries and no discipline\u201D. \u25BA Sign up to our most popular newsletter, From the Editor.

      "description": "As the row inside Reform rumbles on, Camilla speaks to the man behind the headlines: Rupert Lowe. In the wake of his blistering attack on his former ally Nigel Farage, Lowe tells The Daily T the Reform leader is \u201Crunning a cult\u201D and a \u201Cnarcissist\u201D. He also says he might start a new party to the right of Reform, calling for \u201Ca satisfactory alternative\u201D that is \u201Cmore than just a mobile PR machine\u201D. Later, we bring you part two of The Daily T\u2019s interview with veteran Tory MP and father of the house Sir Edward Leigh, who\u2019s leading the charge against the legalisation of assisted dying. Ahead of another debate by MPs on Friday, Sir Edward explains why he has joined forces with Labour grandee Diane Abbott in an attempt to halt the Bill\u2019s progress.
