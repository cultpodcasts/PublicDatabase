      "description": "If you thought the Epstein Files would damage Donald Trump it is here in Britain where they have caused the most devastation. The most damning material yet about the former Prince Andrew include photographs that seem to show him on all fours over a woman on the floor, as well as humiliating emails from his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson to Epstein in which she appears to suggest he marries her. It all raises new questions about the conduct of certain Royals, the monarchy and the Palace\u2019s handling of this over many years, and what this new low means for the whole institution. Andrew has said nothing new - but consistently denies any wrongdoing, despite his financial settlement with Virginia Giuffre. Sarah Ferguson has previously expressed sympathy with Epstein\u2019s victims. In this episode of The Fourcast, Krishnan Guru-Murthy talks to biographer Andrew Lownie, whose work has explored the private world of the Windsors, and historian Kate Williams, who has charted the monarchy\u2019s turbulent existence across generations. Sarah Ferguson has previously said she \u201Cdeeply regret\u201D the involvement with Jeffrey Epstein and that she \u201Cabhor paedophilia and any sexual abuse of children and know that this was a gigantic error of judgment on my behalf\u201D.",

      "description": "In 2011, Virginia Roberts Giuffre became known as the most outspoken victim of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Her campaigning against their abuse and trafficking helped to get justice for many women, but she was perhaps best known for a now-infamous photograph, taken when she was aged just 17, meeting with Prince Andrew. She claimed it was taken prior to one of three times she was forced to have sex with the King\u0027s brother. Encounters he vehemently denies took place but which have led to his public downfall, with Prince Andrew reportedly paying around \u00A312 million to Roberts Giuffre, formally ending a civil case brought against him in the US without admitting liability. Earlier this year, Virginia took her own life. Before she died, she wrote a memoir, determined for the world to finally hear her story in her own words. In this episode of The Fourcast, Jackie Long speaks to Virginia\u2019s brother and sister-in-law, Sky and Amanda Roberts, about the woman behind the headlines, the legacy she leaves, and the campaigning she wanted to be remembered for. They also express their frustration with the Metropolitan Police response - but the Met reiterated to Channel 4 News today that they do not consider themselves the appropriate authority to investigate alleged crimes in the UK related to the Jeffrey Epstein case.This episode includes conversation around suicide and abuse.",
