      "title": "Chapel Probation s5- Andrea: Enduring Toxic Men at Wheaton and Beyond",
      "description": "Content Warning for descriptions of assault and rape. This week we go to the \u0022Harvard\u0022 of Evangelical schools, which is not really a thing. But we go to Wheaton and learn from semi-anonymous guest, Andrea, that the patriarchal systems in place protect men and harm women when it comes to harassment and assault. And at every instance, Christian women are there to defend the men and even find blame in the women who accuse them. Obviously Wheaton is not unique in this patriarchal nightmare, but Andrea went through it all both while there and in life after. Even her Christian therapist found ways to blame her for the horrible abuse she suffered at the hands of her ex-husband. But Andrea fought back and eventually left, both evangelicalism and her abusive marriage. She got a real education, married and not has a loving family, and now educates people. A true hero today. Check out her new Substack, Bullies for Jesus.

      "description": "Despite leaving christianity years ago, Katie Malia has never needed to find community centered on deconstruction. She forged her own creative life without ExVangelical twitter, podcasts, or White influencers. Not even Brian Recker! Gasp. Nope. Katie found life and community in the arts, comedy, and music.

Her deconstruction paved the way for finding humor as both a vocation and a tool for healing. Also a survivor of Scott\u0027s Introduction to Literature class, Katie has found a life outside of Christianity that has been so much fuller and, let\u0027s face it, funnier, than life inside evangelical culture. It\u0027s been an absolute privilege to stay in touch and watch Katie become such an amazing human.

Her latest project is called Mouth: A Little Book of Cheeky Poems, but as of this typing, there are only 5 left. So, hurry up and contact Marla to get yours. The word \u0022fuck\u0022 is provocative, profane, and sometimes the perfect word, especially today. Pairs perfectly with the word \u0022trump.\u0022 Try it!

      "description": "We are back at Bob Jones University, or BJU, with Rick Pidcock . Rick is a writer with Baptist News Global , and he has come a long way from those bizarre, high-control days of BJU. He tells his story of finding his way to being an empathetic human being in stark contrast with the uncaring theobro culture of BJU and how he became a stay-at-home dad, like Scott. And we finish with a last look at the deconstruction world, namely the White men who become influencer/pastors. Lots of great conversation.

      "description": "Jeff Karow told one of the most moving stories a couple of seasons ago, and he returns to Chapel Probation to give an update and to share some of his insights into putting his life together after leaving his conservative church and getting divorced. Like for so many people, deconstructing faith can have dire consequences. Relationships with family and friends can be strained or even irrevocably broken. And yet, we strive to remain true to ourselves as we build the life we want to live. \nAfter one more parting shot at Moody Bible Institute, Jeff talks about his life, and the good news is that things are much better today.\nChapel Probation is part of the\u00A0\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060Dauntless Media Collective\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\nJoin the\u00A0\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060Dauntless Media Discord\u00A0\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060for more conversation with all the podcast communities.\nScott\u0027s book,\u00A0\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060Asian-American-Apostate- Losing Religion and Finding Myself at an Evangelical University\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u00A0is available now!\nMusic by Scott Okamoto,\u00A0\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060Jenyi\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060,\u00A0\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060Azeem Khan\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060, and\u00A0\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060Shin Kawasaki\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u00A0and\u00A0\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060Wingo Shackleford\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\nJoin the\u00A0\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060Chapel Probation Patreon\u00A0\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u00A0to support Scott and for bonus content.\u00A0\nJoin the\u00A0\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060Chapel Probation Facebook\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u00A0group to continue the conversations.\nFollow Scott on\u00A0\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060Instagram\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060, \u2060\u2060\u2060Bluesky\u2060\u2060\u2060,\u00A0\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u00A0and\u00A0\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060Substack\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\nYou can subscribe to Scott\u0027s newsletter and learn more about the book, the blog, and performances at\u00A0\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060rscottokamoto.com\u2060",

      "description": "It often comes as a surprise to non-Asians that people like Rohadi Nagassar and myself have things to say. Especially inside of North American Christianity. Like the proverbial tree falling in the forrest with no one to hear it, we do exist. We Asians often have to find our way out of church to develop our voices. Forget about \u0022platforms.\u0022 We have to first decolonize our own minds to learn that we do have things to say, and then we have to find our people.

      "description": "As someone who was born into a family that got completely fucked by this country, I have some thoughts about the current situation. My family lost everything and had no due process before being incarcerated in concentration camps simply for being Japanese American. No one in my family takes freedom for granted because of this, and no one assumes this country has our best interests in mind ever. So for us, seeing what is happening, we do not hold out hope for the best outcome. For those of you who do not hail from societal and government tyranny, it has to be hard to come to grips with the fact that so much has been lost and so much is still to be lost. All the things this country has stood for, for better and for worse, are on the chopping block if they aren\u0027t already in the landfill. So it should come as no surprise that Scott thinks art and community are the only thing we can cling to as the we sink into the abyss. We are NOT going to be ok for the foreseeable future.

      "title": "Chapel Probation s5- Liz Matthews- Biola Basketball to Authentic Living",
      "description": "Liz Matthews has been a social media friend and member of the Chapel Probation Facebook group, and we finally got her on to tell her story. She graduated from Biola where she played basketball, but she actually had a good time there. Liz brings up the concept of \u0022shelving\u0022 borrowed from Ex-Mormon podcasts. It\u0027s where you place all the doubts, questions, and issues that aren\u0027t compatible with evangelical christianity. But there is only so much space on this existential shelf and when it fill up, it collapses. Liz tells her story of trying to reconcile her deeply-held faith with the realities of the world and her own identity as a queer woman. And it\u0027s epic.

      "description": "Welcome to the first full episode of Season 5! We kick things off with Mary B Safrit , a writer and podcaster who actually interviewed Scott a few weeks ago on her podcast, Found Family . Mary B grew up in a mix of christian traditions and went to a normal college where she worked with Young Life. This solidified her evangelical identity at the time, but she went on to come out as bisexual while still remaining a progressive christian. But fear not. She has done the work, decolonizing from patriarchy and White christian nationalism, and she is awesome to talk to.

      "description": "This week we talk to therapist, author, and podcaster, Janice Selbie. Scott and Priska saw an ad for the Shameless Sexuality conference and knew they had to talk to Janice about her story in which she went from the most conservative fundamentalist world to a sex-positive, religion-free life. The Pentecostal life wasn\u0027t restrictive enough for Janice, so she joined a local group of Mennonites where she did her best to fit in but was never fully accepted by the women there. Now, after an eventful deconstruction phase, Janice has created the Divorcing Religion organization (with a podcast Scott was a guest on) as well as the aforementioned Shameless Sexuality conference. Janice is also the author of Divorcing Religion: A Memoir and Survival Handbook.

After Scott\u0027s Substack post about Harris had 4x as many reads as he has subscribers, we figured we should take a look back at why today\u0027s Christians are so damaged. A big part of it is purity culture. Scott never read the book, having slammed it shut after the first page, but poor Priska grew up in the height of the purity movement. And she has some feelings and thoughts. CW- We don\u0027t pull any punches. This was one of the worst things we\u0027ve ever read (Scott read it for this episode).

      "description": "As we wrap up season 4, we return to where Chapel Probation began: Azusa Pacific \u0022University.\u0022 20 years ago, I was asked to take over a Freshman Writing class because the other adjunct quit suddenly. There I met Rochelle and we\u0027ve been friends ever since. From the shallow, fake people of the dorms to the fringes of APU\u0027s then progressive crevices, Rochelle went from evangelical christian to a shade of Buddhism and a heart for social justice. Her identity as a mixed-race person who is deeply thoughtful and always seeking truth has made her into an amazing person today.

      "description": "You\u0027ve probably heard Caleb Martin\u0027 s music somewhere on TV. I met Caleb in our music community through Shin Kawasaki, whose music you hear every week on Chapel Probation. But I had no idea Caleb had an evangelical background until just the past couple of years when we started chatting on IG about religious trauma. And I\u0027m glad we did chat because it gave me the perfect excuse to talk to him, someone I\u0027ve admired for the past 10 years or so. The admiration I have for such a fine musician and composer is still there, but now I also admire Caleb for his courage to come out of high control religion and forge a life of music and community outside.

      "description": "Happy New Year! We close out 2024 with Dr. Lucas Wilson who survived Liberty University and the conversion therapy it offered. Life at Liberty was complicated as Luke tried to follow the rules and heal himself from his \u0022same-sex attraction\u0022 as the christian put it. But he had some bizarre experiences that left him confused and searching for answer. He would not find the answers at Liberty. But he got himself out and into graduate programs that helped him deconstruct his beliefs and accept himself as he was and is. Conversion therapy was ridiculously weird and awful, but Luke is living as an academic now, and he has edited an amazing book, Shame Sex Attraction which is due out Jan 21. It contains stories of conversion therapy survivors that will make you recoil in horror and even make you laugh. Please give to REAP to help people like Luke make it through their time at christian colleges and universities.

      "description": "It\u0027s Christmas Eve and this means different things for everyone. Some have the family gathering with food and laughter. Many do not. Chaz grew up in an unhappy family that was fully devoted to the horrific teachings of a backwards church. He endured every kind of abuse there is before growing up and finding his way out. As a co-host of the Excommunication Station , Chaz pushes back at the harmful parts of christian culture and politics. And as a father and husband, he is healing from his childhood while fostering a loving and supportive family life. And even though Scott is known to be an anti-Christmas, pro-Krampus curmudgeon, he has a special Christmas message that he fully admits he teared up recording.

      "description": "Dr. Olsen was that kid who witnessed to his elementary teachers and still got A\u0027s. In college, he poked theological holes in his Cedarville classmates\u0027 theologies and was still popular. But ultimately, his quest for knowledge and truth caused him to deconstruct his fundamentalist faith and fully accept his identity as a queer man. Despite emerging from Cedarville with mostly fond memories, Dr. Olsen recognized that the evangelical culture\u0027s toxic views of queerness made many students, faculty, and staff suffer greatly, with some losing their friends and family, and some even taking their own lives. With that in mind, Dr. Olsen started a group called Cedarville Out to give support to LGBTQ\u0026#43; people at Cedarville, and decades later, he is still helping people find their way. You can help LGBTQ\u0026#43; people at schools like Cedarville by giving to the Religious Exemption Accountability Project (REAP) which is doing similar work. Donate here.

Not only do we get the scoop on the expected racism and misogyny, we actually get a practical look at what life under Project 2025 will be like. That\u0027s right. Attending christian schools is the perfect preview for Project 2025. It\u0027s just that instead of being limited to these campuses, the bizarre, oppresive rules will be applied to the entire country. In years past, Rebecca\u0027s story would be a painful reminder of the horrible treatment of women in fundamentalist settings, but alas, here we are, looking to it as a primer for what to expect.

      "description": "If you grew up in purity culture, you were taught that things like sex, alcohol, and porn were evil portals to demon possession, and you would become addicted to these kinds of vices. Of course people can become addicted to things, but purity culture lied to us. For most christians, there is no such thing as balanced living with people making choices and decisions about what they want to do or consume. Scott and Priska talk about their own stories and break down some of the falsehoods taught in purity culture that make people afraid to simply live their lives. Even worse, it teaches people to not trust their own instincts and abilities to assess risk. \n\nPlus, a clip from Content Warning 2024 about pornography and it\u0027s supposed addictive nature, featuring Erica Smith, Tori Williams Douglass, Transvangelica, Wyld Violet, and Cortland Coffey.\n\nPlus a primer on clown sex.\n\nThe Horny Chapel is part of the \u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060Dauntless Media Collective.\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\n\nSend us a message at \u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060hornychapel@gmail.com\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\n\n\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060https://www.instagram.com/hornychapel/\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\n\n\n--- \n\nSupport this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/scott-okamoto/support",

      "description": "Immigration reform has been completely abandoned by politicians on both sides with Christians leading the charge against people coming into the U.S. across the southern border. And with the coming winter of our discontent things will get worse. But it\u0027s important to point out that not all christians are anti-immigrant. In fact, the research of Dr. Lloyd Barba and Dr. Sergio Gonzalez helps us see that the work of creating Sanctuary spaces for undocumented people was started by devout Christians during the Reagan era. These movements formed the basis for attempts to reform immigration into a more humane, and in this case, more Christian system. Their recent limited series podcast, Sanctuary: On the Border Between Church and State is a comprehensive history of the Sanctuary Movement in the U.S. It shows the dire circumstances of people fleeing war, poverty, and oppression and how small groups of christians stood up to the U. S. government to harbor these people in their churches and homes, often at great cost.

      "description": "LGBTQIA students, faculty, and staff at chrisitian schools have always faced bigotry and discrimination. Since the election a few weeks ago, that bigotry and discrimination has increased at alarming levels. Although there is uncertainty about the future of Title 9 protections, the fact is that queer people have not been safe at christian schools and this will only worsen in the coming years as schools might not even need to justify their systemic queerphobia with exemptions to Title 9.

      "description": "Donavon Delisle grew up in a nightmarish household of bizarre christianity and an abusive father who controlled everything. As awful as Donavon\u0027s story is, it falls within the \u0022normal\u0022 area of christian households for the simple fact that it was patriarchal. Sexual, physical, and emotional abuse may have been factors in the house, but these were all under the umbrella of patriarchal normalcy. If it\u0027s acknowledged at all, it\u0027s forgiven and even sanctioned. Because the bible says so. That settles it. But Donavon found love and friendship outside of religion and clawed his way out. He is now a podcaster who used to co-host the Excommunication Station and currently hosts the No One Answered podcast focusing on abuse survivors and Jesus Stole Our Movies, which needs no explanation.

      "description": "Priska and Scott get spicy...well, as spicy as possible within the confines of purity culture...as they talk about their sexual awakenings. Even inside purity culture, curiosity and desire got stimulated, giving them a glimpse into sexual possibilities. From pop culture, movies, music, to their friends, sex and sexuality was on their minds, whether they wanted it to be or not. And as embarrassing or cringey as some of the stories are, Priska and Scott have learned to be gentle with their former selves as they navigated their way out. Hell, they\u0027re still navigating.

      "description": "One could argue that most christian churches and organizations are \u0022culty\u0022 or even proper cults. No argument necessary for the bizarre churches Uriah Wesman grew up in. With their ritual chanting, leaders choosing mates to have lots of children, and ridiculous levels of control over every aspect on one\u0027s life, yep. Cults. The very definition. But even as a kid, Uriah was brave enough to envision a life outside with love and joy and laughter. He used his sense of humor to make sense of things and became a comedian and storyteller with a one-man show that has already had 3 sold-out performances. You can see the next show at the Lyric Hyperion on Thursday, October 24. Get tickets here. --- Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/scott-okamoto/support",

She told me about her time teaching at a well-known Christian school in the area, and I was struck by how similar our stories were. Like me, the whole experience contributed greatly to her deconstruction, forcing her to choose her humanity over the bigotry embedded in evangelical culture, particularly against LGBTQIA people.

She found some good professors and even better friends while at Gordon who helped her to deconstruct her fundamentalist beliefs and forge a new worldview based on truth and love.

      "description": "Long before most of us were a glint in the eye of today\u0027s deconstruction world, Blake Chastain created the Exvangelical hashtag and Facebook group, giving the world the title and the framework for the good, bad, and the ugly of all things related to deconstruction. He also started the Irreverent Media Group bringing together so many great podcasts like the Dirty Rotten Church Kids, Straight White American Jesus, Go Home Bible, You\u0027re Drunk , God Has Not Given , Speaking in Church , and of course, the mothership: Exvangelical . These podcasts, that Facebook group, and the hashtag were the bedrock of the deconstruction world. Since then, as you\u0027ll hear me rant about, many more voices have entered the fray, some of them great, some of them...not so great. But however you feel about White former pastors with tattoos taking up too much space, Blake has written an incredible book, Exvangelical and Beyond , giving the history of both evangelicalism and our current movement away from it. Compared to some insipid influencers just telling you that racism and homophobia are bad, Blake\u0027s book is an actual pillar of information and truth.

      "description": "Earlier this year, I read an amazing piece in the Huffington Post about a woman who was once a pastor\u0027s wife who left the church and ended up opening up her marriage to explore dating and sexuality for the first time. I immediately thought this woman would fit in beautifully with our Content Warning community...only to discover she had actually been at Content Warning. I somehow didn\u0027t meet her there, but it made sense. And having her on Chapel Probation to tell her story and talk about her new explorations of her body and her sexual identity was a real honor. Yes, the SBD is a clusterfuck of patriarchy and sexual abuse, and we talk about that, but I hope you come away from this conversation with a new perspective of life and identity that can only exist outside of Christianity.

Keiko is best known for her role as Lane Kim on the show Gilmore Girls, but she is also a writer, artist, and beloved member of our AAPI arts and activist community in Los Angeles. With her own real-life evangelical past to draw on, she goes deep in analyzing her Lane Kim role as we talk about the dangers and harms to young women inside of purity culture. Gilmore Girls superfan, Priska, unleashes 16 years of pent up questions, making this conversation must-listen for all Gilmore Girls fans.

      "description": "Hannah Lee knew early on that life inside of her Korean American church was far too restrictive for her. And even though she felt that church life was deeply embedded into life as a Korean American, she saw its limitations as a curious, passionate person who valued art and people outside of the church. From her mom trying to exercise demons who would have her buy ski pants (true story) to the damage of purity culture in the 90\u0027s, Hannah broke free in early adulthood and has carved out a life outside. She found queer community and art to replace Christianity and Purity Culture even as she continues to find ways to connect to her family.

But there are still incredible similarities between our experiences...bad ones, mostly. Scott\u0027s experiences as a Gen X-er in the 80\u0027s was less intense than Priska\u0027s Millenial experiences in the 90\u0027s, but both were rife with guilt, shame, and racism. And sexism, of course. We basically tie it all together in this episode: race, gender, purity, and a struggle to find ourselves inside the christian world. We round up the episode with some observations about some AAPI christian churches, good and bad.

      "description": "Marla Taviano returns this week to talk about how her latest book of poetry, Poem Art Therapy , can help all women who\u0027ve been through terrible marriages and divorces in the christian world. Just as her White Girl Learning work reflects Marla\u0027s journey as she decolonizes her mind regarding race, Poem Art Therapy reflects her clap back against patriarchy and shitty christian marriages and men. She reads from her book at the end and the episode wraps with a track from Scott\u0027s old band, Band Moto, that perfectly represents Marla\u0027s and our feeling towards terrible men. For the first time I\u0027m including music Dave and I did with our old band, \u2060Band Moto\u2060 . So be warned.

      "description": "Christa Brown was a victim of horrible sexual abuse as a child by her SBC youth pastor. This took place in what she calls, \u0022Baptistland,\u0022 and this is the title of her incredible book . She writes unflinchingly at her childhood filled with abuse at the hands of said pastor and her family members, but she also pulls herself out of Baptistland to become a successful attorney. She eventually takes up the fight against the SBC when she discovers that her experience was not unique in the SBC. In an attempt to expose the coverup that was systemically engineered at every level, she created a database of pastors who had been credibly accused of sexual assault. This led to her being brutally attacked online and threatened in person by everyone from top SBC officials to everyday congregants of SBC churches. But through it all, she has found her voice and her identity. To me, she\u0027s a bonafide hero. You can read more from Christa on her Substack and her previous book, This Little Light: Beyond a Baptist Preacher Predator and His Gang.

      "description": "I knew Dave Galvan as a friend and bandmate for many years before I learned that he grew up in a strict Pentecostal church. And I learned in this episode that Dave led worship with a black Les Paul copy at that church. Epic. When you know people outside of religion, you can just live and enjoy life, so I was a little anxious making Dave go back through his early days, but that\u0027s what bandmates do. We go on each other\u0027s podcasts and talk about depressing shit. For the first time I\u0027m including music Dave and I did with our old band, Band Moto . So be warned.

But even more has happened since early 2022, so I\u0027m actually glad he finally agreed to come over and do this. It\u0027s a story of a common upbringing in high control pentacostalism to the lighter theologies of Inter Varsity Christian Fellowship at the beginning. But life got pretty damn scary for Mark after he joined the Navy while in medical school. After seeing up-close the horrors of war, he came home with his faith severely challenged. And then we almost lost him to a rare form of lung cancer that severely affected his life. But Mark has rallied, deconstructed, and is living an incredible life today. It\u0027s an epic tale that I just couldn\u0027t edit down because it has so much insight to offer us. And as you\u0027ll hear, it\u0027s a story that Mark is still processing today.

She has dedicated her life\u0027s work to helping people heal from their patriarchal pasts that stunted their development as sexual humans and move forward to explore their bodies and their sexuality. With a deep understanding of race, gender, and the maddening behaviors of fundamentalists, Erica is well-suited to help folks in deconstruction become more whole as humans. You can check out all of her courses and writings at her website. And be sure to check out Dr. Sara Moslener\u0027s incredible podcast about the history of Purity Culture and its ties to White supremacy, Pure White.

But Abraham Kim found music and drums early on to help him deal with life, drumming his response to violence at home and oppression in the church. And he found his way out with the help of Talbot (Biola) and found footing in a full, beautiful life with his life partner, Priska, who you heard in Season 3. He\u0027s one of my favorite drummers in the world, and one of the best people I know. You can purchase the Blazing Rays of the Sun\u0027s EP on Bandcamp.

But she met me when I was still trying to be a Christian, and she helped me become the person I am today. So it makes sense to have her be the guest for the 100th episode of Chapel Probation. You\u0027ll hear her story, her perspective as a visitor to APU when I was teaching there, and you\u0027ll hear the origins of her art and activism. Get to know this person. One of the best people I\u0027ve ever known. traci\u0027s book, Navigating Without Instruments is available, and it\u0027s an incredible collection of poems and short essays that reflect her life, the tragedies, the art and activism, family, and death.

      "description": "Despite this episode containing some incredible music by Shin and the presence of Keiko, a bonafide Gilmore Girl and TV/Movie star, very few people heard this, comparatively. So before season 4 gets going, I wanted to give newer listeners a chance to hear from two of my favorite people on the planet: Shin Kawasaki and Keiko Agena. Even as the show Gilmore Girls was winding down, Keiko Agena came to APU to participate in the first ever Asian club campus-wide event. Her husband, Shin Kawasaki came, too, joining several of our friends who came to support the Asian American students at APU. Keiko and Shin are two of my favorite people in the world, and they went on to come to APU for the next 6 years until I left. In this XL episode of After Hours, they reminisce about their memories of the events and the students, and they talk about some of the episodes of Chapel Probation. Shin\u0027s music has elevated this podcast for both seasons, and we get to hear him perform at a recent concert in Little Tokyo. You can support Shin\u0027s music by purchasing it on Bandcamp here. You can purchase Keiko\u0027s book, No Mistakes: A Perfect Workbook for Imperfect Artists here. And if you are interested in letter writing to encourage people to vote, check out V ote Forward , an organization Keiko has worked with for the past few elections.

      "description": "Repost in honor of The Brothers Sun, a series that was just cancelled despite being hugely popular. All the love to Jenny Yang. Before Jenny Yang became a big-time comedian and Buzzfeed sensation, before she became a writer for television, and before she was cast as one of the stars of The Brothers Sun, a Netflix dramedy starring Michelle Yeoh, Jenny was a brand new comic, looking for stage time. I had her perform at APU for the Asian club, APASO, and the head of Student Life liked her so much, he booked her for the big APU comedy night, giving Jenny her first full-length set of 45 minutes. Sure, APU was kinda pissed to later find out that Jenny was not, in fact, christian, but Jenny absolutely destroyed the audience. So much so, that I had an extra 5 or 6 students trying to crash my classes for the next few semester simply because of my association with her. Jenny was always so supportive of my work at APU, giving her time and talents to the APASO group, singing with my band, and doing standup. So I brought her onto Chapel Probation After Hours to reminisce our days of slogging through evening 210 freeway traffic to help out the Asian kids at APU.

About 11 years ago, I went to a Tuesday Night Cafe and saw a young woman in her early 20\u0027s perform there for the first time. Priska\u0027s voice and playing floored us as she performed her original songs, and she immediately became part of our community as an incredible singer/songwriter and all-around amazing human. As I got to know her, I discovered that she was in the process of deconstructing her faith, and we bonded over our shared love of music and our leaving christian faith. From trauma experienced as a young woman worship leader to navigating family dynamics with her still-christian family, Priska has experienced the full range of life in deconstruction. This is a special episode that features 5 songs from Priska\u0027s 2018 EP, State Change , which you can buy on itunes. She is working on a new EP that will be out soon.

      "description": "It\u0027s a bromance that eclipses the love of women. It\u0027s playful, raw, and unabashed. God has made men in his image, and that image is good, so young christian men at evangelical schools not only proudly display their dicks and balls, they create ways to interact with them. In this episode, we look at the practices and we laugh a little, but we also worry that this entitled, rather domineering display of manhood might have sadder and more insidious implications. These are christian men, after. We are joined by Tori and Justin on the Go Home Bible, You\u0027re Drunk podcast, Nate Nakao of the Full Mutuality podcast, and Jeremiah and Julia of the Sexvangelicals podcast. And go back to some old clips of this subject and even revisit some guests to talk more about dicks and balls. At the end there is a bonus segment with Hope and Nicole and BJ, reacting to the episode as only they can.

Jeremiah and Julia won\u0027t likely be listed in such lists for Abilene Christian or Calvin college. That\u0027s because they are licensed sex therapists who promote sexual wellbeing in all of its forms. Their podcast, the Sexvangelicals , is a great look into unpacking religious trauam when it comes to sex and sexuality, and a resource for people looking to expand their understanding of sex and sexuality. Here they talk about their religious backgrounds and how they found their way out to do the very important work they do today. In the conversation, Soulforce comes up, so here\u0027s the episode with AE Scott who went on the early bus rides and helped form the community that would become Haven at APU.

      "description": "Esther Tseng is a badass food blogger and writer who wrote the article, The Silence of My White Friends After Atlanta , back in 2021. She captured what a lot of us were feeling during a time when our AAPI community felt targeted by rabid, ignorant MAGA Trumpers. But before she became a renowned food writer and social justice advocate, Esther grew up in a fundamentalist christian home that hindered her growth as a human. Through progressive church and therapy, she found her way out of faith altogether, finding identity in community and food. Check out her Instagram to experience her journey of food and culture.

      "description": "It may seem a little harsh to post an episode the day after xmas with the creator of the Harmonic Atheist youtube channel, it just kinda worked out that way. Tim Mills is a self-described atheist who, like so many others this season, devoted his life to absolute adherence to fundamentalist Christianity. But his quest for the truth ultimately led him right out of faith, despite the horrible cost of losing friends and family. But he\u0027s doing good work, hosting the conversations that need to be had and pointing out the dangers of fundamentalist religion. Here\u0027s the link to the Bill Zuersher video mentioned in the episode UPDATE: in the original version of this episode during the first break, I incorrectly said that the bible was not written in Greek. I was dead wrong. I apologize. I misremembered some Bart Ehrman passages about the futility of learning the original languages because we still don\u0027t know who wrote them and we don\u0027t have anything close to original manuscripts. That\u0027s what happens when I rant about something I read 20 years ago. I\u0027ve corrected the rant.

But K realized she was not satisfied with the answers to her questions. It wasn\u0027t even close.

In the patriarchal, abusive, and oppressive world of IBLP, going to a Southern Baptist Convention college was a breath of fresh...er air. Freshness being relative in this metaphor, Kit, found freedom in SBC college and even got up the courage to finally break free of her bizarrely overprotective parents who really just wanted to keep her as a little girl until she could be handed off to a husband. Through health scares and personal growth, Kit finally deconstructed her faith and, spoiler, found an abundant life on the outside.

And Simon is one of the finest humans I\u0027ve had the pleasure of knowing. In the past year, we\u0027ve talked about our views on race, gender, patriarchy, and all aspects of life, and I knew I wanted to have a conversation with him on Chapel Probation. Think of this as an adjacent conversation to our usual talk of religious deconstruction. We\u0027re skipping ahead from religion and just focusing on what it takes to be a good human on this planet.

In this bonus episode while I\u0027m on vacation, Jo and I talk about our books while sitting on a bench in Central Park just a stone\u0027s throw from one of Turmp\u0027s towers. Jo\u0027s forthcoming book, Predatory God is due out next year, and she\u0027s currently in the editing phase, which can be a soul-crushing part of the writing process. From the haunting voices of our past selves to the patriarchal and White-dominated world we all live in, it can be tough to fight through our traumas to write a book. But Jo is doing it. She even wrote one of the endorsements for my book. As we talked about our books, we get deep into our lives and our processes, and I hope you enjoy this candid, vulnerable conversation between to friends and writers.

She was part of the group of students who saw me and welcomed me in as a fellow fringe/bad person at APU. I remembered my mentor professors who let me into their personal lives at UC San Diego, and I allowed myself to be that professor with them. And Kristin being an amazing writer meant we spent a lot of time workshopping her work and talking about life. I saw her go through some of the toughest times of her life, but I also saw her meet her now husband Nik. I even went to their wedding in the Bay Area. But we\u0027ve never really talked much about the christian stuff before, so this was an amazing chance to unpack all the turmoil and all the great times we had as we went through it. At the end, there is a special \u0022Band of my Deconstruction\u0022 segment with Sugarcult, who Kristin and I went to see once in Bakersfield, where she was living with her father at the time.

      "description": "I spend way too much time trying to figure out how fundamentalist, conservative White folks become enlightened and caring of the world around them. We may never know, but meeting Tim Cooper has given me hope. Tim deconverted slowly over time and taught himself to interrogate first his faith and then his worldview. And in a relatively short time, he has become an incredible human being, far from his religious and White-centered past. As recently as 2022, he was still trying to live as a christian, but no more. After going to Masters College, he asked all the questions even as he repeatedly doubled down on his faith. And then he decided to stop doubling down. And the world is better for it. Sketch-Alert: After hearing Tim talk about how Masters is known as a school that is \u0022serious\u0022 about the bible, I let some King Louie inspire me to come up with a sketch based on Monty Python moments. A bunch of christian college admins go on a talk show to decide whose school is the most serious about the bible. CONTENT WARNING: The usual offensive material we are known for.

      "description": "Jon Carl Lewis went to Princeton, but he sought out the repressive Christian elements he grew up with, hoping to \u0022pray the gay away.\u0022 But, he deconstructed after some horrific and lonely times to progressive forms of Christianity, eventually finding his way to leather bars in Boston and a life of sexual liberation. He has written and taught about sex and sexuality, even in largely White spaces like the Wild Goose Festival, using all of his life experiences to help others deconstruct their guilt-ridden purity culture pasts find liberation through their bodies and their sexuality.

Thankfully, his rigorous training, practicing, and performing in the Music Department kept him so busy that he didn\u0027t get the full brunt of all the usual racism, bigotry, and conservative fundamentalism of the school. And as the concept of the divine has come up in the past few episodes, Paul learned to find the divine in music and art as he deconstructed his faith.

He resolved to live as a celibate queer woman and become a youth pastor, and even did so for a time. But he eventually found a fuller life and a viable faith by transitioning. It was this new perspective as a man secure in his identity that unlocked the missing elements of christian faith and a life fully-lived.

Heather may have been born with some health issues, but her three-valve heart is strong, as you\u0027ll hear. From dutiful, yet repressed, childhood to an out and proud bisexual woman living free, Heather\u0027s story will inspire all who find themselves climbing out of oppressive religious culture.

      "description": "Andrew Pledger grew up in a Christian fundamentalist cult (IFB) that led him to attend Bob Jones University. He knew he was gay, and he knew things were not right with the faith that criminalized his very existence. But as a young man, he had no options to escape his family\u0027s control or the bizarre, abusive rules of BJU. At first, Andrew tried to put his head down, follow the rules, and get out with a degree. But BJU, a global pandemic, and his own development as a human made that impossible. He pushed back, got expelled, and has been speaking out ever since. Through it all, Andrew found his voice, and he\u0027s using it to help bring healing to survivors and attention to the dangers of these christian institutions that harm so many people. Andrew is the creator and host of Surviving BJU, which is set to premier on August 23. You can also listen to Andrew\u0027s previous podcast, Speaking Up .

Em went to Vanguard University for a year, trying her best to follow God\u0027s will, but when it became financially impossible for her to continue there, she started to question what God\u0027s will even meant. She attended and worked at churches that were trying to be \u0022relatable\u0022 and \u0022contemporary,\u0022 but the cracks in the shiny surface became something she couldn\u0027t ignore. Today Em lives with her husband and kids and is trying to be the supportive parent her own parents could never be because of their fundamentalist beliefs. And she\u0027s doing great.

But the connection to the bible and God never quite happened, despite her best efforts. But like a lot of us, she held on to the music in church until she just couldn\u0027t anymore. For both of us, music kept us in church and it led the way out and into the world. You\u0027ll hear clips of our jam session and learn about the bond between musicians, which is something you do not hear much these days. Best of all, you\u0027ll hear Jazz talk about her life during and post faith. She\u0027s just so damn cool.

      "description": "If you\u0027ve watched the documentary, Shiny Happy People , you know some of the horrific details of the Institute in Basic Life Principles (IBLP) and the Advanced Training Institute (ATI). Both are systems that drive a cult that became mainstream when The Learning Channel aired too many seasons of that insipid bullshit about the Duggar family. America ate that shit up and made the Duggars the placid faces of IBLP. Sickening. We\u0027ve since learned of the abuse and grooming of young women to be used by the men in power at IBLP/ATI. Content Warning: a lot of talk of abuse coming. Jessica Goforth\u0027s family got in early with IBLP, and her parents converted to the cult, thus ensuring Jessica\u0027s teen years would be spent in an abusive family and later an abusive \u0022training center.\u0022 This one is hard to listen to, so take care of your own mental health as you listen. Jessica is also a co-host of the Leaving the Village podcast that should be restarting soon. The podcast covers the stories from inside IBLP/ATI and will feature some of the people from Shiny Happy People.

      "description": "Think you know about evangelical revivals? Did you hear about the one at Asbury this year? This episode with author and life adventurer, Tim Mathis, will shed new light on how revivals erupt, so to speak. I promise you, it\u0027s not what you think. Or if it is, you\u0027re probably a regular listener of Chapel Probation. Tim Mathis shares his personal stories and observations of his time at Asbury, and he makes a compelling case that revivals and repressed sexuality are connected. We even have a sketch to explain it. CW-The sketch is R-rated, so be advised. Thanks to Ashley Dunston for playing the lead. Thanks to my nephew, Luke, for being the opening boy voice. And thanks to Owen, Ethan, Audrey, and their friends, Waseem, Shaunt, and Maria for lending their voices to the madness. And finally, Tim talks about his life as a self-described \u0022Dirt Bag\u0022 which he writes about in his book, The Dirtbag\u0027s Guide to Life: Eternal Truth for Hiker Trash, Ski Bums, and Vagabonds . Tim\u0027s first book, I Hope I Was Wrong About Eternal Damnation, was about his decision to leave faith for a more fulfilling life.

I want everyone who listens to Chapel Probation to also get to know the other podcasters in our Dauntless Media group , and Gail is one of the founding members. From rough family beginnings to foster care, Gail grew up in Canada in highly religious settings. But she, like her fiance, Nate Nakao, deconstructed to become an amazing human with a heart for all people. We talk about her story and her life and perspective today. Gail and Nate had me on Full Mutuality back in April when my book came out, and Nate was a guest here in season 2 where he talked about his time at Bob Jones.

But that was before REAP came on the scene bringing legal firepower to the fight against the inhumane bigotry and discrimination all evangelical schools are guilty of promoting and enforcing. The tide is turning now. Paul Southwick started REAP after working with trans students at an evangelical school, and Erin Green, an established queer activist on evangelical campuses in her own right, joined up to make one hell of a badass duo. You\u0027ll hear how Paul and Erin started out and how they do their thing. And you\u0027ll even have an opportunity to join a new religion that can have the same religious exemptions as christians, but you\u0027ll have to worship Erin...I mean we get to worship Erin. White nationalist, cis-het christians beware! You can read about the work REAP has done and is doing here . You can donate to REAP here .

She went to an EV college almost by accident before switching to a public school to finish undergrad, but then found herself at a conservative Catholic high school. Her experiences there were eerily similar to my own experiences teaching at APU with racism, misogyny, and anti-LGBTQIA hatred run amok. But Holly did her best to be a teacher who created space for the marginalized students and forged alliances with other teachers and students. Through it all, she deconstructed her faith and found her own worldview and identity. Just like I did.

      "description": "Peter Fenton is a young man just 6 years out of college at Wheaton, and he is killing it. His creative output for this year alone is incredible, and his past life as an evangelical has served to fuel his creative energy. He\u0027s got a film he produced making the festival rounds, and his play, Abandon All Hope is set to premier at the Rougue Theater Festival Off-Broadway this Saturday night. A lot has happened in a short amount of time for Peter professionally and personally. His faith, his sexuality, and his career path have all been affected by his deconstruction, and a lot of it can be traced back to his time at Wheaton. The bonus segment this week is a minor rant from Scott about the Texas battle to mandate a 10 Commandments in every public school classroom. As someone who loves public schools and once taught in them, myself, I have some thoughts. Question: can you list all 10 Commandments? I didn\u0027t think so. UPDATE: thankfully Texas Bill 1515, which sailed through the Texas senate, stalled in the House and didn\u0027t get a vote before the deadline. You can read about it here .

In this episode, Marla talks about her early days as a dedicated evangelical Christian, blissfully unaware of the bigotry and oppression BIPOC people face and her experiences and relationships that helped her see the world as it is in all its beauty and tragedy. After some missionary work and a wrenching divorce, Marla now lives a joyous life elevating marginalized voices and celebrating a life of wonder. UPDATE: Spotify has informed me that using this song is a violation of copyright, so I had to take the segment down. It was never monetized. Just free advertisement for the record company and Rush. Today\u0027s bonus segment is another Songs of My Deconstruction where I share my love for a band called, Rush. Because of the amazing musicality and heartfelt lyrics, Rush was part of my faith journey. They were also part of my deconstruction, as I saw the world through their eyes, musically and poetically.

From Calvin College to Claremont Graduate University, Dr. Moslener has become an academic force exposing the dangers of purity culture. Her first book, Virgin Nation: Sexual Purity and American Adolescence , put her on the radar of everyone interested in the creepy history of purity culture, and she has a new book coming out next year called, After Purity. She is an incredible speaker and conversationalist, and she is definitely funnier than Brad Onishi.

Advocating for social justice alienated him from his community, his best friends, and his family. The episode starts out as another great, fun, look at an evangelical school, in this case Moody Chicago, but it ended up being a life-changing experience for both of us. No comedy or music segments in this episode, although I did record a parody song, which I apologize for to everyone except Ed Sheeran.

      "description": "Dr. Julie Ingersoll is an expert fly fisher and fly fishing writer, but that\u0027s not why you\u0027re here. Dr. Ingersoll is also a researcher and scholar of religious studies, and she has been a leading voice in exposing American evangelicalism as a threat to democracy and a pluralistic society. Like me, she deconstructed decades ago, forging her own identity as a scholar and as a human outside of the confines of American christianity. Interestingly, she was once a part of the Christian Reconstructionist movement, one of the movements that influenced today\u0027s dominionist groups, including the New Apostolic Reformation. We eventually get to how fly fishing can heal our damaged psyches, but not before Dr. Ingersoll speaks some hard truths about how many branches of christianity harm us all today. Buy Dr. Ingersoll\u0027s book, Building God\u0027s Kingdome: Inside the World of Christian Reconstruction.

      "description": "Lily was a founding member of the Sisters 9, a group of writers, musicians, and artists, who carved out a space for themselves as free-thinkers devoted to lives filled with art and exploration. Naturally, she was an enigma at a place like APU, and she quickly deconstructed her faith, replacing it with a mission to bring uncensored art to the campus through zines and an open mic event called, \u0022The Line.\u0022 Clad in a dingy pink Bunny suit, she stood before the entire school during chapel and announced her event as a place to express unfiltered thoughts and expressions. Like me, she caught the attention of the school and had to answer for it all. But Lily began distancing herself from evangelical people and all faith, even fleeing SoCal when she graduated to live completely untethered from christianity in San Francisco. Dealing with her rough upbringing and religious trauma helped her become the person, the mom, and the artist she is today. A couple of new components to Chapel Probation in this episode: a new sketch of a \u0022children\u0027s\u0022 bible story program (1:11:30) about a terrifying story of Zipporah and Moses. My wife Geri and my son Owen helped out. And we have some bonus content at the end of the episode.

There she was indoctrinated into purity culture and fundamentalist views of the bible and church.

      "description": "It\u0027s Valentine\u0027s Day. Yay. Whatever. The topic that I get asked to cover most is purity culture. And while many of the guests on Chapel Probation have mentioned sex and sexual experiences, almost all the stories get told as cautionary tales that result in punishment or guilt or shame. Not fun. Sex and sexuality should be a normal part of human development, but if you add evangelical culture to the mix, it gets toxic. We were taught to deny our sexuality and fetishize our virginity as some kind of mark of Jesus on our soul. So how about we just talk about sex and sexuality without the guilt and shame. No embarrassment, even for the less good experiences, and no shame for our desires and identities. So, I brought S2.E1 guests, Hope and Nicole to help me tell stories and talk about sex. We had a blast, and we could have talked all night, but Nicole had a hot date with her husband, so we got a solid hour-plus of stories, observations, and claiming our sexuality. Content Warning: Lots of frank, open talk of sex and sexual acts. Listener discretion is advised.

I\u0027m talking about Daveo Mathias , a talented writer and creative human who got hammered by APU\u0027s evangelical culture to the point where he stopped believing in God because of his time there. As a new freshman, Daveo got a story published in the prestigious and new at the time web site McSweeny\u0027s. And while that might have offered a young writer some serious writing cred at a normal university, for Daveo, it was just one in a list of sins he committed simply by being a thinking, living human. Like many others, he found his people, but he still feels the pain of being rejected by an intractable, unforgivable culture that demanded conformity of its White students.

Brad\u0027s book, Preparing for War- The Extremist History of White Christian Nationalism and What Comes Next i s already a best-seller on Amazon during its presale days, and it\u0027s out today, January 3, 2023. It\u0027s a book that should be required reading to all who care about the state of this country. We talk about Brad\u0027s time as a student at APU, and note how the white nationalist culture of the early 2000\u0027s grew into the nightmare of MAGA Nation. And we talk about our heritage as Japanese Americans and how evangelical culture made us ashamed of who we are. We\u0027re all good now, and learning and growing still, but it\u0027s tough looking back at what we once were. We do settle a score from earlier this season when Blake Chastain and I called out Brad to outdo Blake\u0027s chapel probation story, so you can hear the results of the contest now. It was a close one, but I think I made the correct ruling. Let me know if you disagree.

But, no one I ever talked to, outside of my own friends and family, thought I could write a book worth reading. Until I met David Morris. First of all, how many male Asian American (much less Japanese American) authors of non-fiction can you think of? That pretty much tells you what the publishing world thinks of us. But David saw me and heard what I had to say. He saw value in both my voice and the stories I have to tell. Once I had David in my corner, I knew I could accomplish anything. David, in addition to a couple decades in the religious publishing world, has a doctorate in Psychology, and he brings his unique perspectives to Chapel Probation After Hours to talk about the podcast and his thoughts on the evangelical world. I even get him to cuss.

The underground LGBTQIA club, Haven, was fairly new, and the school was now fully aware of its existence and activities. Chris was part of the first group of leaders, along with Liz Cirelli, to start openly challenging the school\u0027s hateful policies and advocating for the rights of queer students. This led to the school doing the unthinkable to Chris, which made crystal clear the values of evangelical culture. Thankfully, Chris is living a great life today, advocating for queer youth, and raising a family of her own.

      "description": "Matt Kendziera is a writer, podcaster, and drummer who has lived an amazing life full of growth and change. And like all of us on Chapel Probation, he has had trouble with the evangelicals. But despite the hard times, Matt is a supremely positive person with a personality that draws people in, allowing them to tell their stories. His book, Bring it Home: The Adventure of Finding Yourself After Being Lost in Religion is out now, and it\u0027s a lovely read. You get a sense of nostalgia for childhood and youth, and you get Matt\u0027s story of experiencing various christian faiths before leaving most of it to create his own identity. There are many similarities to my own book in the themes, but readers of Matt\u0027s book will get a great sense of the midwest and the culture therein. And Matt\u0027s podcast, Chasing Goodness is an inspiring conversation between deep thinking people who have experienced a lot of life. Matt reflects on his own Inter Varsity Christian Fellowship experience, and relates his life to the themes of Chapel Probation. A really great conversation.

      "description": "Brent Walmsley has attended 3 evangelical schools, so naturally, he is no longer evangelical. From the Assemblies of God North Central, Bethel, to Fuller Seminary, he deconstructed at each stop, leaving it all in 2016 when Trump became the face of evangelical christianity. Along the way, Brent disagreed with the evangelical treatment of women, LGBTQIA people, and BIPOC people, as the culture of christianity cemented itself into bigotry and hate. Today, Brent is a moderator of the Life After Facebook group which is dedicated to providing resources to ex-evangelicals, and he is committed to being a resource for people who want to get out of evangelical christianity.

I wrote the scary theme music and do the editing and mixing for them. Mostly I just needed a little breather after 20 straight weeks of putting out episodes. We\u0027ll be back next week with another real episode and a new After Hours segment. This week I talk about the music behind Chapel Probation, shout out a few listeners, and ask the question: What should season 3 look/sound like? Have we decisively made the case against evangelical higher education? Certainly, there are lots more stories to tell, so we\u0027ll continue to tell them, but what other angles should we take?

My guest, a super cool Black woman who wishes to remain anonymous, worked at APU for 12 years and was beloved by students and her non-racist co-workers. But the culture of the staff at APU was ridiculously white supremacist and conservative, making most days at work unbearable. Anti-Blackness became the norm at places like APU in 2008 when Obama was first elected, and it rose to a fever pitch by the time Trump was elected. My guest endured so much racism, but she learned to push back before she finally left. The Black students had it bad at APU. The Black staff had it worse. Students were at least paying customers with some protections. There were no protections for staff like my guest today. She was literally told to take the opportunity to exercise forgiveness and grace when racist shit went down.

      "description": "Like some professors at evangelical schools, Michael Smith came to APU assuming he would be teaching at an academic institution. He quickly learned that the school was more concerned with teaching fundamentalist and conservative lifestyles than actual academic learning. Combined with the school\u0027s obsession with criminalizing sexuality and any faith traditions outside of evangelical christianity, Professor Smith struggled to find his footing. Faculty and administration seemed wary of his Episcopalian faith and status as a single man. Things got better when he got married, but the seeds of discontent were planted. Like so many other awesome profs, he left feeling disenchanted with both evangelical higher education and christianity in general. The draconian treatment of LGBTQIA students, the twisted manner the school treated all sexuality, and the campus-wide internet filters which no one, not even professors, could circumvent ultimately showed Professor Smith that the school was a Sunday School first and an academic institution second. This week\u0027s sketch features Hope and Nikki from the Biola episode that kicked off Season 2. Along with Scott\u0027s kids, Audrey and Owen, they parody the whole internet filter situation.

      "description": "Even though the 4 of us went to an actual \u0022top-notch\u0022 university, UC San Diego, our involvement with Inter-Varstiy Christian Fellowship meant our faith was in constant action and activity. We didn\u0027t have to deal with a university-wide culture of racism, misogyny, and anti-LGBTQIA hatred, but we embedded ourselves in a clatch of moderately conservative christianity that served to tamp down significant parts of our identities and sexuality. For Tim and Kevin, their experiences as closeted gay men added one more layer of shame, fear, and pain. Even still we were leaders in IVCF. Kevin was even a staff person for 5 years. We lived our faiths in \u0022radical\u0022 ways before we all deconstructed to varying degrees of faith and agnosticism. It is this experience as the best kind of christian in an academic and scientific setting that gave me (in my mind) the authority and the cred to teach at APU, even after I no longer believed in God. And even though we at UC San Diego got incredible educations, we did not escape the harm done to us by evangelical culture.

      "description": "Eugene was a student in my last ever Freshman Writing class at APU. We\u0027ve kept in touch over the years, and I knew I wanted him to tell his story on Chapel Probation early on. After sharing an experience on the facebook group, Eugene agreed to be interviewed, and I\u0027m so glad. We talk about the special brand of evangelical racism he encountered, his experiences being in all the different choirs, and his memories of being a closeted queer student before coming out years after he left APU. While most non-white cis-het men have to deal with bigotry and marginalization, Eugene had to deal with feeling both invisible and stereotyped as an Asian American, and feeling like his sexual identity was something to tamp down and ignore. Fortunately, he has learned and is learning to explore all aspects of his identity now. And like so many, he has APU to thank for his faith deconstruction, which has enabled him to dive into his identities. Nate and Gail from the Full Mutuality podcast join me and my daughter Audrey for this week\u0027s Chapel Probation players sketch. And we continue with our \u0022special\u0022 music bits with a bonus segment in which we re-imagine a beloved worship song as a queer anthem. You\u0027ll hear Eugene in the \u0022studio\u0022 recording the track as the \u0022producer\u0022 tries to make sense of it as the track becomes more and more...horny.

Through this community on both twitter and in real life, I\u0027ve met so many super cool people, including Blake, who I consider a friend today. Someday we\u0027ll hang in person, but this episode actually has me wondering if we might BE the same person in some sort of mishap with the space/time continuum. Until we get that sorted out, this episode has Blake talking his time at Indiana Wesleyan University where he began deconstructing from evangelical christianity. He had some great professors who challenge him and inspired him, and he had the typical professors who seemed as interested in fundamentalist indoctrination as teaching their subjects. But Blake has forged his own path of not just deconstruction, but decolonization, as he speaks often about his recognition of privilege as a White man and pushes back at White supremacy and complimentarianism. This episode begins with another meeting of the Asian American Secret Society with Brad Onishi and Nate Nakao and I discussing whether or not to let a new member into the group, Veterans of Culture Wars co-host, Zach Malm. I should have probably written a script for this one, but we had fun just vamping improv-style.

      "description": "Carla Godwin grew up in Nebraska in a conservative Christian household. She settled on Grace Bible College in Omaha knowing there were limited career options for women in that world. While being constantly reminded of the expectations for women, Carla began pushing back against some interpretations of the Bible. But patriarchy and purity culture kept forcing her to question even more of her faith, leading her to join more progressive churches and organizations. Even still, purity culture was ingrained into the heads of the men, highlighting the rift between men and women in christian settings. I was fortunate enough to meet Carla a the Deconstruction Meetup in Portland, and I am so grateful to call her a friend today. Her story and her perspective are so important for everyone to hear. We mentioned Dr. Tina Schermer Sellers and Pastor Josh Scott as excellent resources for christians regarding sexuality and a progressive worldview. I think they are also just great resources for everyone.

      "description": "Zach Malm came from a family prominent in the Vineyard church world and went to Seattle Pacific University where he was sorely disappointed in both the theological depth and the academic rigor. He ended up seeking these things at a new startup church called Mars Hill. Yes, that Mars Hill. The good news Is that Zach would eventually be credited with bringing Mars Hill down when he revealed to the world that a misogynistic asshole posting on the church website was none other than head pastor Mark Driscoll, himself. He deconstructed during the Trump era and now is a co-host of the Veterans of Culture Wars podcast. You can hear more about Zach\u0027s epic tale of taking down Mars Hill Church on the Full Mutuality Podcast, and his own VCW podcast. Bonus this week: We wrote and recorded a song. It\u0027s called, \u0022Jesus Is Cool- A-minor Worship). We joked on the VCW podcast that there weren\u0027t any worship songs in A-minor, so we decided to write a deconstruction \u0022worship\u0022 song. Mr. ExVangelical, himself, Blake Chastain, joined the choir at the end. The song is up on Scott\u0027s soundcloud .

Her 4 years culminated with the 2016 election and swearing into office Donald Trump, which made a lot of sense to her as she witnessed the rise of the alt-right at APU. But those 4 years helped Josie find both her community and her sense of purpose to push back at bigotry and oppression. As she shed her upbringing in Pentecostal and Baptist churches and found herself in opposition to fundamentalist teachings at APU, Josie found purpose and identity. She is a co-creator of the Speaking in Church podcast with her good friend Spencer Rose Taylor, and together they talk about \u0022about everything from current events and how your theology informs your responses to them to other hot topics in the church.\u0022 Chapel Probation is part of the Dauntless Media Collective Music by Scott Okamoto, Jenyi , and Shin Kawasaki and Wingo Shackleford Join the Chapel Probation Patreon to support Scott and for bonus content.

      "description": "John Verner and Chris Loux went to the Moody Bible Institute in Spokane, Washington in the years leading up to the Trump era. Like most guests of Chapel Probation, they came in on fire for their respective brands of fundamentalist faith, with John coming from a Calvinist background. Amazingly, these two became unlikely friends through their shared love of music, even though Chris had a completely different background. They both quickly began deconstructing their faiths as they learned more and asked questions. What really impressed me, though, is how these two white men, coming from vastly different backgrounds, both began decolonizing in the midst of some pretty hard deconstruction of their theologies and their faiths. They saw the overt racism, anti-LGBTQIA hatred, and misogyny in evangelical culture, and they pushed back. John is the creator of the Cult of Christianity podcast today, and his second season should be starting around the time of this episode\u0027s release. And even though John and Chris now live on opposite coasts, they are still great friends with Chris often joining John on the podcast. These young men give me hope for the future of this movement centered around deconstruction, and I\u0027m so glad I\u0027ve gotten to know them this year.

      "description": "While many of the guests on Chapel Probation explored and developed their identities as they actively fought against the bigoted culture at their evangelical schools, Bruce Whyte came to APU and never felt like those movements and the spaces that birthed them were for him. But Bruce was not a typical BIPOC student at APU whose mind was colonized by whiteness. Quite the opposite. Bruce just came to APU with an already developed sense of self as a Black man whose perspectives just didn\u0027t quite match those of the student groups trying to foment a new revolution at APU. Bruce was a keen observer of what was going on, though, and he used his observations and experiences to shape who he would become as an ordained chaplain. There is so much wisdom and insight into race, the human condition, and so much compassion and empathy in Bruce today, and his negative experiences at APU played in role in Bruce\u0027s growth as a person and as a chaplain. No Chapel Probation Players this week. Instead I took time to honor a former colleague, Dr. Matthew Hauge, who bore the brunt of the the dysfunction and brokenness of the BIPOC community at APU.

      "description": "Adrianne and her twin sister Analiese grew up just blocks from APU in the city of Azusa. They had no idea that the city they knew and loved had an enclave of mostly wealthy, predominantly White people who looked down on them and saw them as unsaved because they were Catholics. And unlike other BIPOC students on this podcast who found pockets of safety in the Multi-Ethnic Programs or in Haven, Adrianne struggled, at first, to find a place to just exist without judgment and condemnation. As someone who didn\u0027t speak Spanish, she didn\u0027t feel welcome in LASA. She had to hear students, faculty, and staff talk about the \u0022dangers\u0022 of the city of Azusa outside the walls of the APU campus. She faced overt racism. And she had to endure constant scorn and criticism of her, then, Catholic faith. Incredibly, Adrianne taught herself how to push back at the many layers of bigotry she faced. She engaged her classes and classmates, and she argued with her professors. In the end, the crucible that is APU molded Adrianne into a tough, compassionate person who fought for others as much as she fought for herself. It\u0027s a emotional ride to the end of this episode, and Adrianne shares a piece of her past self that paints APU as the bigoted, awful place it is for people like us. This week\u0027s Chapel Probation Players introduces Naomi Ko , an actress, writer, and filmmaker best known for her role in the film version of Dear White People and the Mortified podcas t and documentary on Netflix.

      "description": "Matthew came to APU looking like the prototypical APU man. He was a White guy from Orange County who attended a megachurch, but he came to school knowing he was not a straight man. As he navigated his faith and tried to reconcile it with his sexuality, he quickly discovered that he needed to push back at the professors spewing lies and hate at LGBTQIA people. He grew tired of the ridiculously bad academics in his liberal studies and education courses, so he took a second major in psychology to get some sense of an academic experience. It turns out pastors do not necessarily make good college professors. It also turns out the psychology department, at the time, hired and supported bigoted professors who spewed lies and evangelical bullshit. In this episode, Matt brings the heat with notes about all of his stories. We didn\u0027t even get to all of them, but this episode is an indictment of both the low-level academics and the bigoted views of the faculty at all evangelical schools.

Women get asked to forgive abuse from men all the time, and Ashley was asked to do everything she could to reconcile with a man who didn\u0027t respect her as a person for the sake of following the \u0022biblical\u0022 principle of family values. Along the way, Ashley began deconstructing her faith, with help from some solid professors who looked out for her, and she started to live life without evangelical fear. She eventually met, fell in love with, and married a man who supports her as she is. You can hear more of Ashley\u0027s story on the Profane Faith podcast here .

Her recent conversion, though, meant she didn\u0027t know all the cultural and social references to evangelical culture. Her decision to go to South Africa for a 3-month mission trip would become a first step out of evangelical christianity as she was thrown into a culture in transition with race tensions and the AIDS crisis raging through the country. Of course APU did not prepare students for what they would encounter, and the stress of living in such blatant racism and the callous treatment of people dying of AIDS gave Lina and many others PTSD. They are still dealing with the fallout to this day. To top it off, APU had one more traumatic experience to provide Lina right after the missions work ended.

We won\u0027t tell. A little longer episode than normal, but I just had to get all the stories into this one from Nate Nakao. Nate is the co-creator and co-host of the Full Mutuality Podcast , and his story of surviving Bob Jones University, or BJU (pause for teenage giggling)...will blow your mind. If life at APU, Biola, or Vanguard seems horrible, there are no words to describe life at BJU. With a draconian demerit system in place to monitor and police student behavior, they\u0027re basically hunting for reasons to expel students as sinners or, dare I say, reprobates. In a place where a single drink of alcohol or viewing of a PG movie results in immediate expulsion, the notion of any kind of life that values art and connection to the world is simply not possible. But Nate pushed back, even as he fought to remain at BJU, and came out feeling certain that this kind of christianity was not for him, or anyone who had any sense of self. Sadly, Nate would go on to join the megachurch world, including Hillsong, which you can learn about on the Full Mutuality Podcast , but this episode is just about BJU. And it\u0027s a lot. Happily, Nate is now a self-actualized person. He and his partner Gail have started the podcast collective Dauntless Media, which you\u0027re tuning into now, and he is doing the work to undo the damage done by evangelical culture. A happy ending after BJU.

      "description": "Every adjunct college professor dreams of having a full-time, tenure-track position. Cynthia Vacca Davis was offered a tenured position teaching English at a small Bible College, a job that offered a good salary with benefits. The problem was, Cynthia had just agreed to be a supporter of her friend Danny, who had just come out as an intersex male after living well into his adulthood as a female. The president of the Unnamed Bible College (UBS) pretty much lost his dull, tiny mind upon hearing about Cynthia\u0027s friend and her plan to write about Danny in her MFA program. So, Cynthia had to make a choice: sign the violently anti-LGBTQIA faith statement to get the job or forego the job in hopes of finding something else. Evangelical schools make every student, faculty, and staff member sign statements of faith that contain all manner of indefensible garbage, and many sign it in bad faith, choosing to ignore the statement and still be in good standing at the school. I have a whole book about doing this, myself. But Cynthia couldn\u0027t bring herself to attach her name to a school that expressed such overt hatred towards so many people in the world. She has a book, Intersexion , from Lake Drive Books about her and Danny\u0027s journeys that I hope you all will buy and read. I know I learned a lot about intersex people from it.

      "description": "In the second part of our almost 4-hour conversation, Abbie and Liz talked about the many ways evangelical culture oppresses women, particularly queer women and women of color. They tell stories of how they fought patriarchal systems from the inside at APU through the so-called Women\u0027s Resource Center and inside the classrooms. As we suffer through a dark time of Supreme Court activism on behalf of fundamentalist views, Abbie and Liz remind us that this fight has existed long before 2022, long before they fought the good fight at APU from 2007 to 2012, and even before that. But they also remind us that it\u0027s worth the cost to wage this war for women because so much is at stake. Evangelicals really believe women are subservient to men, and this view is dictating the very laws that govern our country. I know you will be inspired by the courage and the clarity of thought from Abbie and Liz in this episode.

      "description": "Biola is a Southern California evangelical school, similar to APU. It tends to be a little more conservative in every measurable way, but Hope and Nikki decided early on to push back at the repressive culture around them. They lived their lives to the fullest, going to great lengths to appear to be \u0022good\u0022 Biola students while maintaining a fast-paced life of partying and fun. But it wasn\u0027t all fun and games. Their unwillingness to cater to white male fundamentalist rules made life difficult and even dangerous for them. In the end, both Hope and Nikki saw through the charade of Biola\u0027s \u0022chill\u0022 and \u0022relatable\u0022 evangelicalism and recognized the racism, sexism, and ridiculous purity culture vibes all around them. Most importantly for them, they realized the treatment of women and women of color were a preview of the coming age of Trump. Be sure to check out Hope\u0027s blog, And Hope Does Not Disappoint.

      "description": "Long before Haven, led by Glenda and her friends, found themselves in a national spotlight, Amy Scott came to APU not yet understanding their identity. Within a year of their time there, they would realize they was not straight, and that this part of their identity was a threat to the fabric of APU\u0027s conservative evangelical culture. This also meant, the culture was a very real threat to their fledgling community being formed in the wake of Soul Force\u0027s Equality Ride. That event would embolden two students to take a stand against the school\u0027s anti-LGBTQ policies, and it would give Amy a sense of purpose for themself. They would go on to be an activist with Soul Force, staging protests against the military\u0027s so-called, \u0022Don\u0027t Ask, Don\u0027t Tell\u0022 rule and the barbaric treatment of LGBTQ students at APU. I distinctly remember watching Amy from afar, deciding just how I wanted to make it known that I was an ally. The posts on the infamous Door of Discussion were getting campus-wide attention thanks to two students who identified as gay, and there was pressure for all faculty to toe the evangelical line. But once the door had been opened, pun intended, the choice was clear to me. I couldn\u0027t just hide behind my role as English professor. I had to pick a side, and I knew I had to pick the right side. When students soon after started the Gay/Straight Alliance (GSA), they asked me to be a part of it, and I jumped in. Abbie and Liz\u0027s and Glenda\u0027s episodes tell those stories. But Amy and their friends were all alone, in a much more scary time for them. Whereas Glenda described Haven\u0027s influence on the campus which created a kind of \u0022cool\u0022 rebellious vibe where straight kids wanted to be involved and often presented themselves as queer, Amy and their friends went to APU at a time where queerness was universally regarded as being an abomination. Students were being expelled, faculty were being fired, and the culture was completely unforgiving to anyone who was queer or queer-affirming. It was extremely rare for me to encounter a student who was not openly hostile to queer people. And yet, Amy and their friends pushed and resisted, sacrificing their sanity and their safety to make change in an impossible setting. But there were young people watching, and they would continue the fight that continues to this day. You can follow Amy Scott on instagram .

      "description": "Glenda McDannel was tapped by Haven\u0027s graduating leaders to be a co-leader of the group just as it was emerging from the shadows of APU\u0027s underground. She didn\u0027t know it at the time, but she would help lead the group into battle with the homophobic and transphobic culture and administration to make the campus safer than it was. And during her final years, she would see Haven become a nationally known group. APU\u0027s Queer community became a fascinating cross-section of students who were openly queer, students who were \u0022wrestling\u0022 with their queerness, and students who simply wanted to appear to be counter-cultural. It reminded me of wealthy white students adopting hip hop identities as some kind of cool rebellion in a conservative white space. Some students even claimed to be some form of queer while also maintaining their fundamentalist, purity culture, evangelical values. If the journey of coming out is complicated in the secular world, it is exponentially more complicated in evangelical spaces. With all of the spiritual and emotional abuse and resulting baggage, the process is fraught with guilt, anxiety, and fear. Even so, Glenda and her community fought for their place at APU. Building on the work of the generations before them, they continued the activism, and art nights, and the celebrations of life needed to make the fight worthwhile. But in the end, Glenda would be expelled from APU in the shadiest of manners, leaving us to believe she was booted out for her role in making APU safer for LGBTQ students. This was confirmed by a well-intentioned administrator keeping in touch with her and reaching out to help her get back in years later and after an official LGBTQ student org was in place. The fact that he thanked her for all her work to help LGBTQ students only made it worse. The very things she was kicked out for were being lauded but only because the policies had changed. To her credit, Glenda refused to return and finish the 2 classes needed to graduate. She is living her life with a good job. She is married. And she is still an amazing person I am honored to know.

      "description": "Dr. Craig Boyd came to APU to be the Director of the Institute of Faith Integration. Within the first week, he was confronted with the absurd nature of the rest of the administration comprised of confused men and women trying to serve the two mutually exclusive masters of respectable academia and evangelical culture. At every turn, Dr. Boyd would learn, evangelical culture would win, leaving him struggling to figure out how to navigate the \u0022systems\u0022 of a university suffering a crisis of identity. It is an honor to have Dr. Boyd join us on Chapel Probation to give us insight into what went on behind the closed doors of an administration that loudly claimed to care about things like diversity and academic excellence while seeming to make decisions contrary to those ideals. What we as faculty and students assumed was some kind of evil intent (and I\u0027m sure that was there), might have simply been incompetence coupled with blind allegiance to the almighty conservative dollar from alumni and far-right donors. Whatever the reasons for all the shit we went through, systemically, culturally, and theologically, there seem to have been confused and inept administrators pulling the strings and pushing the buttons, and Dr. Boyd was there to witness it all. You will be amazed. You will gasp in disbelief. You will laugh out loud. And if you went to APU or any school like it, you will be depressed.

      "description": "Dr. Daniel White Hodge survived 8 long years at APU, teaching in Global Studies and Biblical Studies. He refused to play nice with the white supremacist culture of the school, and that, as many of us know very well, makes for a tortuous experience at APU. But like many of us, Dan found and developed his identity as a Black man and as a Christian as he fought for his humanity and his place at the school. After 8 years of teaching and fighting the racist culture of the students, the faculty, and the administration, Dan was done. He has gone on to teach at other schools and his podcast, Profane Faith is in its 6th season. I met Dan through Sammie Howell , whom you\u0027ve heard in episode 4 of this podcast, and loved seeing him around campus and hanging out once in a while. He was gracious enough to come speak to APASO one night, and he scared the bejesus out of the Asian kids with his account of his experience in the LA Riots. But Dan is such a great ally of all marginalized peoples, including Asian Americans, and his humor and generous spirit is infectious. Through his teaching and his podcast, he is making the world a better place through dialogue and story.

      "description": "Jonathan Garcia just gets shit done. He has made a life of putting himself in places of power and influence, at times at great cost to his sanity and humanity. As an undergrad and graduate student at APU, he forged his identity as a co-founder of LASA (Latin American Student Association), as a leader in student government, and as a member of the administration itself. That put him at the table with rich, conservative, bigoted people, but Jonathan worked to form relationships and influenced their views. The significance of the fact that he got the president of the school at the time, Jon Wallace, to change his views on immigration can\u0027t be overstated. APU is a place where hispanic students can go with support and financial aid, regardless of citizenship status. Real change as a result of Jonathan and LASA. For people like me, I have only disgust and hurt when I think of APU\u0027s administration and board of trustees. I was never given the benefit of the doubt, and I was listed as a \u0022bad\u0022 or \u0022dangerous\u0022 professor simply because I dared talk about social justice, racism, sexuality, and identity in my classes. But Jonathan reminds me that the people I hate are, in fact, people. He gave them the chance to see him and rethink their views. He\u0027s a goddamn hero. Jonathan is currently the Chief of Staff at Portland Public Schools. He has worked in education at several huge school districts, and he was named by Forbes as one of their 30 Under 30 in Education.

      "description": "Liam Young is a former student who, by all measures, shouldn\u0027t have gotten along with me. When we first met, he was ultra-conservative and a newly enlisted Marine. But from the very beginning, he was interested in learning and being challenged. Seeing firsthand how the prosperity gospel is both a horrible misreading of the bible and a weapon used against lower-income people, Liam began deconstructing from evangelicalism early on. From there he saw racism and other forms of bigotry ingrained in evangelical culture, but here\u0027s where it gets interesting. Instead of sliding into liberal or progressive views, Liam looked more into older versions of christianity. It\u0027s not my thing at all, but it makes a kind of sense when you think about it. Contemporary versions of christianity have added white nationalism, bigotry, and worship of money to their religion, Liam went looking to church traditions that existed around 1500 years before evangelicals were formed. There he and his wife found theological answers to his criticisms of evangelicalism, but there was a catch. They found all this theological wonder in an Egyptian Coptic Orthodox church. In the end, Liam is a kindred spirit who cares about humanity while holding to his faith. I salute him for that. So many conservative kids came and went through my classroom who refused to engage in discourse about tough topics. Liam was always up for discussion, and he was an eager and active listener. All this made for an amazing story of personal convictions leading to growth and discovery. An inspiring and fascinating story all around.

      "description": "Before LASA (Latin America Student Association), ethnic orgs at APU were places to hide out away from the oppressive white culture that dominated the campus. The Multi-Ethnic Programs office was safe space to find your people and build communities of support. Matthew Gonzalez, Rod Olmeda-Lopez, and Jonathan Garcia created LASA during the beginning of the Obama era. Not content to just offer support and care to the shell-shocked Latino(x) community\u0027s daily experiences of racism, they forced APU to confront its racism head on. They changed school policy and fought the school\u0027s racism when the school told them they couldn\u0027t honor the late Joe Snell, the director of MEP, with a Dia de los Muertos offrenda. APU only had Town Hall meetings when the shit really hit the fan. Just a year earlier, it held one to address one of the many swastika incidents. LASA would force a second one when it voiced its anger at having their Dia de los Muertos display taken down for no other reason than it was not a white tradition. The admin told them it had pagan roots despite acknowledging that school-sanctioned events around Halloween and Christmas also had pagan roots. The difference? Hmmmm.... But it wasn\u0027t just protesting. They worked with administration and the board of trustees to get APU designated as \u0022serving hispanic communities,\u0022 they made financial aid available to undocumented students, and they got Spanish translations for the live stream of graduation. Just as importantly, LASA pushed the culture to pay attention to all non-white communities, which may sound strange, but believe me...that was something. These guys are my brothers. I\u0027m so proud of who they have become, and I\u0027m honored to have seen them grow from confused young evangelical men into who they are today. Do I poke fun of them? Of course. But they are two of the strongest and most admirable people I\u0027ve ever known. Enjoy the episode.

      "description": "For at least 6 or 7 years, maybe more, an amazing event took place at APU (and then the Citrus College parking lot when they got booted). The LGBTQ club, first called the GSA (gay-straight alliance) and then Haven, put on a showcase of LGBTQ creativity and pride. At first, it was just called \u0022Art Night,\u0022 and it was held at the 7 Palms, an outdoor amphitheater ringed by palm trees...7 of them, I believe, though I don\u0027t think I ever actually counted. The first few years, the group was underground, and we relished the thrill of putting on an event with poetry, music, and visual art celebrating LGBTQ identities in plain sight on APU\u0027s campus. It was a brazen thing to do, since technically, we could have all been kicked out for doing it. But we did it. Abbie and Liz Cirelli both played significant roles in making the GSA/Haven and Art Night happen, and they both organized protests and movements to change the draconian culture and policies of APU. They made things happen by building coalitions and using them to force the administration and the culture to shift its policies and views of LGBTQ people. Badasses, both of them. This is the first of two episodes with Abbie and Liz who will be back to continue the stories about feminism and misogyny inside APU\u0027s conservative evangelical culture.

      "description": "Ella Baker survived APU while presenting as a half Korean and White young man knowing she was something more. Her deconstruction began early on as she realized through the sheer force of her intellect that evangelical culture had lied to her. After a period of atheism and anger, she channeled her energies into spiritual growth and became a strong, zen, christian, trans woman. While at APU, she was part of a group of students called, the Sisters 9. It was a writing group where they could share their writing and music that didn\u0027t fit with the values and ethos of APU\u0027s ultra-conservative evangelical culture. This group inspired me with its commitment to developing their craft with all of them developing their own identities in direct opposition to APU\u0027s identity. They were, to me, a combination of the Bloomsbury Group in 1920\u0027s England and the Beat generation of the 60\u0027s. You will hear more from this group in the future. Finally, you will hear an indictment of evangelical higher education. While there are some damn fine professors at places like APU, far too many classes are taught as evangelical indoctrination courses instead of the stated subjects in the course descriptions. Depending on your path through the faculty, you could be well-prepared for graduate school or horribly unprepared. Or something in between. Whatever the academic experience, you will be traumatized if you aren\u0027t a conservative cis-het, white person. As with others on this podcast, Ella found a way to survive and learn to convert the trauma into life skills. You will be inspired. You can find Ella at Heyellabird on Instagram.

      "description": "Sammie Howell was one of the progressive pillars of her class of 2010. She went from \u0022on fire\u0022 somewhat conservative evangelical to firebrand progressive warrior in her four years at APU. From the very beginning of her experience, she found herself on the outside of APU\u0027s white, wealthy culture. After an early incident where a fellow student asked her if she knew how to use chopsticks (Filipinos don\u0027t use chopsticks for their food), she found APASO (Asian Pacific American Student Org) and began her growth into a badass leader in a sort of Multi Ethnic Org renaissance. In addition to her work and advocacy for race issues, she joined the newly formed Gay/Straight alliance, even taking great risk in lending her apartment as the secret meeting space. If we had been found out, we would have faced grave consequences, as we had members of student government, RA\u0027s, and...a faculty member at those meetings. There is a surprise at the end of the episode that both gives a glimpse into Sammie\u0027s strength, pain, and love, while at the same time making the case that white evangelical spaces are not safe for those on the margins. Join the fight on the Chapel Probation Patreon where you can hear an introductory interview with Satan and Baby Jesus with more content on the way.

She looks back and talks about how she was so angry at the white evangelical culture around her while simultaneously playing along and repping the school as a Multi-Ethnic senator. She also shares the struggle students face when they come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds than the majority of students at APU. One of Scott\u0027s most memorable moments in his 15 years at APU came courtesy of Dacia. In her last semester, she was forced to take a freshman-level Intro to Literature class in order to graduate, so she took Scott\u0027s class. In it, she performed a poem and created a moment that will forever be cemented in Scott\u0027s (and the class\u0027s) memory. V is for victory and...

      "description": "If APU knew that it was directly responsible for the deconstruction of conservative, white men, it would lose a lot of sleep. BJ Karlik is a physical therapist in Colorado Springs who now identifies as an atheist. He credits APU\u0027s Bible classes for his deconstruction, and his story obliterates the current narrative from famous Evangelical pastors who say the EX-Vangelical movement is based solely on \u0022isolated\u0022 bad experiences of bigotry and a desire for hedonism. Bigotry is, indeed, an issue, and hedonism is fun, but those are not the only reasons for deconstruction. In BJ\u0027s case, they weren\u0027t remotely involved in his deconstruction. There is a salute to BJ\u0027s wife, Carrie, who BJ says \u0022did a little Campus Crusade in college\u0022 (sounds like drug experimentation!) who came to understand the urgent need to see the Evangelical world for what it is. It takes courage to ask hard questions and take stands that leave you on the outside of communities created for you, and both BJ and Carrie have shown a great deal of it.

      "description": "Dez Revish revisits his unique time at APU and recounts his deconstruction of faith. After growing up in a Black church, the christianity of the evangelical world felt like a completely different religion with a different god and Jesus. As a leader in the Multi-Ethnic Programs community, Dez became a conduit between administration and the students. This put him in a tough spot, as he learned that the administration had no real interest in changing the racist culture, but rather it wanted to appease the progressive students and stay in the good graces of the Board of Trustees and all conservative funders. In the end, Dez is happy being far away from evangelical culture and APU. He currently lives in Texas with his girlfriend and two kids. --- Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/scott-okamoto/support",
