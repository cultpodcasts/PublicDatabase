      "description": "TW: Child Sex Abuse - Abuse Cover Up Discussion Within 2x2 Church Leadership\n\nThe viewing/listening of this can be confronting for anyone, but especially for victims. Suggestions for safe viewing/listening include: choosing to listen/watch it alongside people you feel safe with and trust, rather than listening/watching it alone. You can choose to listen/watch it in small portions rather than all at once. Know that there is no requirement to listen/watch it as soon as it comes out, or even at all - do what is best for your mental well-being. You could ask someone you trust to watch it and share the information. And lastly, if you are distressed by listening/watching it, remember that you are not alone and there are others who will be experiencing the same response as you. There is no shame in that response. Always if you need to, reach out for support.\n\nFollowing is the full audio, with captions, of a recent Washington, Northern Idaho, Alaska (WANIDAK) workers\u2019 meeting discussing the rejection of guidelines of child sex abuse and sex assault, as well as the results of a sex abuse investigation conducted by the GRACE organization (Godly Response to Abuse in the Christian Environment).\n\nIn the meeting, Darryl Doland, overseer of the WANIDAK region, shares that he is concerned about a recent investigative report by the GRACE organization, and the implementation of guidelines regarding sex abuse allegations (including CSA/SA) within the fellowship.\u00A0\u00A0Doland states, \u201DAnd I don\u0027t know anyone that was closely involved in the investigation that would ever do it again. And I\u0027ve, of course, talked to everybody that\u0027s been involved. At this point, I\u0027m going to have to say, from my perspective, I\u0027m not sold on investigations.\u00A0\u00A0And that\u0027s a pretty major thing, because if I\u0027m not sold on investigations, our guidelines have problems.\u201D\u00A0\u00A0\n\nDoland goes on to say, \u201CAnd like when we hired GRACE, the idea of that was that it would be like the gold standard in that If we had an investigation like that, that people would be able to trust the results.\u00A0\u00A0Well, I don\u0027t think it changed anybody\u0027s mind. If it did, I don\u0027t know who it is.\u201D\u00A0\u00A0Doland shares that earlier in the day, \u201C....Alan Mitchell (Overseer of Queensland, Australia) called me from Australia and he goes, \u2018Hey, Darryl, I\u0027ve got to hear about your investigation, how are you feeling about it?\u2019\u00A0\u00A0And I said, \u2018Well, I don\u0027t think I\u0027d do it again.\u2019 He said, \u2018Oh, I\u0027m so glad to hear that. Do you mind talking to all the overseers in Australia and New Zealand about this?\u2019\u201D In the recording, Doland shares his feelings that implementing policies, guidelines, and investigations fall outside of the scope of his spirit-led leadership.\u00A0\u00A0He offers a reflection of the significance of being aligned with scripture, and that they had not been considerate of a significant number of CSA victims and perpetrators that had moved on saying, \u201CBut I realize that there is actually an amazing number of people in our fellowship who have had bad experiences, including with CSA, and both the perpetrator and the victim have moved on with God\u0027s grace.\u201D\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\n(For the record, the comprehensive investigation conducted by GRACE found the victim to be credible.\u00A0\u00A0We are left to wonder why the ministry is so unhappy with the investigation.\u00A0\u00A0Also for the record, it is AFFT\u2019s understanding that the survivor who was the subject of the investigation spoke with Doland and indicated they were unhappy with the investigation; however, it seems Doland misunderstood or mischaracterized what the survivor meant.\u00A0\u00A0The survivor made the point that the investigation did not have to take place because none of the information was new. It was all known before the investigation started. If the ministry believed all victims, the investigation wouldn\u0027t have been needed. The survivor believes there are cases where investigations will be needed, but in the majority of cases, a determination could be made with the information presented in the allegation if the survivor victim is believed.)",
