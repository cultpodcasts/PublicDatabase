      "description": "Lauren and Lisa are calling out the dirty dynamics of cult-hoppers. Unfortunately, it is very common for people who spent many years in cults or high control groups, to find themselves in another dysfunctional organization or relationship down the line. Because the subtle abuses of the leader/abuser have been normalized, the dysfunctional behavior and cunning tactics are tolerated. It is a muddy mindf**k, to say the least! Find out how to become aware of the patterns, to stop them in their filthy tracks! *Podcast content can be triggering.

      "description": "It\u0027s common to struggle with perfectionist tendencies. We want to be the best parent, student, or person we can be. But some classic cults, oppressive religions, and narcissistic abusers take it way too far and filthy. Impossible standards are presented (that the leaders claim to have achieved), and expect their followers/members/partners to reach these levels of perfection. The victims are sent into an obsessive state of striving to be the most \u0022pure\u0022 or \u0022clear\u0022 that they can be. Sometimes their entire salvation and worthiness are dangled in front of their faces as a constant reminder of what they will lose if they don\u0027t adhere to these mythological standards. Lisa and Lauren call out these dirty tactics, and explain how this unattainable pursuit of perfection is meant to keep you stuck, disempowered, and devoted to dysfunction.

The world was shocked when a recorded conversation between Lori Vallow Daybell and her sister was played in court during her recent trial. Lori\u2019s deeply dirty mind was exposed, along with other dysfunctional traits and characteristics that point to grandiosity, narcissism, and chronic victimization. How do we spot the signs we need to avoid these types of people efficiently? And which of us are more at risk? *This episode was recorded before a verdict was reached in the trial, and we are happy to report that justice was reached for every victim, as Lori Vallow Daybell was found guilty of all counts. **Podcast content can be triggering.

The Doomsday mom\u2019s reactions in court have been downright strange, but we can understand her muddy murderous mind a little better when looking at it through the lens of fight/flight/freeze/fawn responses. Lauren then reflects on these responses in abusive dynamics (that any of us could be exposed to!), and how to spot the red flags before our beliefs get too dirty and distorted! *This episode was recorded before a verdict was reached in the Lori Vallow Daybell trial, and we are happy to report that justice was reached for every victim, as she was found guilty of all counts. **Podcast content can be triggering.

One of the yuckiest manipulations is slowly guiding us to shut down the part of our brains that accesses critical thinking. Without it, we turn off our true sources of intuition and knowing, which -spoiler alert!- actually causes us to live in a chronic state of self doubt and anxiety (along with many other filthy feelings).
