      "description": "In what ways can sending a child to a religious school shape their social life and development? How does the concept of disconnection as practiced in Scientology affect the concept of family and personal relationships? What are the emotional consequences of such a policy? Today, we\u0027re venturing into a world that\u0027s often shrouded in secrecy and controversy\u2014Scientology. Our brave guest, Reese Quibell, aka Relatable Reese shares a deeply personal journey of growing up within the confines of this organization. Reese opens up about the challenges she faced, from the emotional desensitization she endured to her chilling recount of abuse and the community\u0027s severe repercussions for her cries for help. Reese\u0027s story isn\u0027t just a tale of survival within Scientology\u0027s oppressive walls - it\u0027s also a testament to the power of healing and reclaiming one\u0027s life. She describes the complex impact on her child\u0027s life, their silent pact to protect him from Scientology\u0027s reach, and the heart-wrenching choices they\u0027ve had to make. We\u0027ll delve into the emotional and psychological upheaval Reese has gone through and the strategies she\u0027s employed in her remarkable path towards recovery. From praise to L. Ron Hubbard to the estrangement from loved ones, Reese shares the emotional turmoil caused by the organization\u2019s practices. The powerful influence stories like Reese\u2019s have had on the public perception of Scientology becomes evident as she recounts her reaction to television portrayals of the cult\u2019s abuse. Our own Reena Friedman Watts engages with Reese, reflecting on the parallel challenges of motherhood and the innate desire to protect our children. Wayne Friedman offers his insights on spirituality, free thought, and applauds Reese\u2019s strength and openness.
