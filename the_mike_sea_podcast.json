      "description": "In this episode, host Mike Sea speaks to Isabella Young, a former messianic cult member. Isabella shares her personal story for the first time and gives a riveting account of the murder of her son, and the brainwashing she experienced under the rule of a cult. What started as a seemingly innocent relationship with a spiritual guru led to years of mental abuse and manipulation. Isabella shares her brave account of escaping this cult community and her healing journey from the trauma of the entire experience.\n\n\u2605 TABLE OF CONTENTS \u2605\n0:00 Start\n2:40 How It All Started\n9:54 Arrival At The Ashram\n15:00 Tactics Of Cults\n22:06 Sexual Abuse And Manipulation\n30:20 Theological Teachings\n35:55 Punishments Of The Cult\n35:26 Common Problems In Marriages Today\n39:35 Marriages And Finances\n41:02 Cult Leader Gaslighting\n44:11 The Loss Of Isabella\u0027s Son\n50:21 Isabella\u0027s Breaking Point\n54:24 Custody Battle\n58:40 How To Leave A Cult\n\n\nShow notes:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@feelingbetternaturally1099/videos\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nThe Mike Sea Podcast/Natural Man, LLC is intended as general information for educational purposes only and should not be construed as professional advice, assessment or a diagnosis of any kind or as a substitute for licensed treatment by a qualified professional.
