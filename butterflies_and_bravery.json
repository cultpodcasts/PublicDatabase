      "description": "Sometimes we all need a little reminder that we\u2019ve got this. In this episode, Whisper and Jemima share some affirmations that can give us that reminder. And in their signature fashion, throw in a little bit of everything as they wander around things off topic, catch up on their week and spend time laughing at themselves. So if you need a little break from your day, this episode is for you.1. I am worthy. Worthy of being loved and cared for. Worthy of the good that comes to me. Worthy of being able to express my feelings.2. I deserve to take up space. I don\u2019t need permission to exist.3. I am not my trauma. My dysfunctions are not a measurement of my true ability.4. I have the right to acknowledge my feelings without having to justify them.\u00A0 I have a right to express all my feelings \u2013 positive or negative.5 Thinking suicidal thoughts doesn\u0027t mean I want to kill myself, it\u0027s means I am hurting and in need of care.6. I have a right to ask for what I want and I have the right to be happy.7. I have a right to change my mind.8. I have the right to say \u201Cno\u201D to anything.

      "description": "\u0022Grief does not change you. It reveals you.\u201D -- John GreenGrief and loss are things that we all face at some point in our life. But when losses come one after another, we can end up in grief overload. Melissa found herself facing this, having lost her mother and two brothers in a short period of time. But where many might have crumbled, Melissa found the strength to not only hold the many facets of her grief, but to find her joy again as well.\u00A0 In this episode Melissa joins us to talk about it all and share what she learned on her journey.We have included below something Melissa wrote about grief and some of the things that it has taught her.10 lessons I learned on grief1. Everyone grieves differently.Be authentic in your grief. Some grieve with tears and outward pain. Others don\u0027t cry, or quietly grieve or some grief is expressed in the honoring of requests, memories. I could go on with so many ways we grieve but through all grief, may we be authentic in carrying our memories and love, not judging ourselves for either being in tears or not, whether at the appropriate time or not.2. Grief IS physical. Be kind to yourself and take time to care for your body, mind and spirit.\u00A0During times of grief, find something you love to do and make time for it. Whether it\u0027s taking a walk, dancing, a long bath, playing music... make an effort to do at least one thing that makes you smile.\u00A03. Life goes on. This can be a blessing, but sometimes this can be the saddest part of loss.\u00A0Life is busy and that can help to keep you distracted from falling too deeply into depression during loss, but sometimes the fact that life is happening and your loved one is no longer there to share it with you can be just as painful.\u00A04. Almost every emotion you\u0027ll feel in the roller coaster of grief can be traced and connected to love. Even anger, it all stems from love.\u00A05. Grief is lonely. Don\u0027t deny yourself though, the solitude. With time, when you\u0027re ready to engage again, your true friends will still be there waiting to include you, with no judgment.\u00A06. Initially, focusing on your loved ones death is all consuming. But with time, and maybe with intentionality, your focus will change to their life. It\u0027s a beautiful transition that honors, not the fact that they died, but that they lived.\u00A07. Life is precious and living with regrets is bitter.\u00A08. Stop expecting, or hoping the pain to disappear. The moment you accept that you\u0027ll walk with grief as a companion for the rest of your life, the more you \u0022settle into it\u0022 instead of fight it. It\u0027s the fighting it that gets tiring!\u00A09. You will never fully return to being the person you were before your loss. Grief will irrevocably change you! Accept yourself as you are now, you may be more compassionate, maybe less tolerant of selfish or shallow people. You will, without a doubt, see life in a different way.\u00A010. It is possible to have your heart bursting with happiness and gratitude while simultaneously carrying grief and pain.\u00A0For some reason I had this idea that I\u0027d be full of only sadness from day one until whatever date I finally \u0022got over\u0022 my grief. But now I realize that\u0027s so far from the truth. The day I accepted my ability to carry both happiness and grief at the same time was a day I finally felt peace. My heart will always carry my grief but it now has space to simply live with happiness and joy at tSupport the showSupport The Show: https://paypal.me/bnbdonations?country.x=US\u0026locale.x=en_USVisit our WebsiteFollow us:InstagramFacebookTwitter",

Leaving religion and deconstructing the trauma that she had experienced may have been easier if her life wasn\u0027t struck with tragedy in her teen years. Somehow she stumbled upon Dr. Janja Lalich\u0027s Take Back Your Life Courses, and now works with Dr. Lalich, Sally Martin and Beth Matenaer who are survivors and trauma informed therapists.

Growing up with an abusive step parent made it almost like he had never left the cult. Life as an adolescent \u0022on the outside\u0022 was a culture shock for Joe. Having lived in India during his childhood, returning to school in Australia was a whole new world he had never experienced. Joe was able to pick up the shattered pieces of his childhood, and create a life for himself and his family that was worth living. Just when everything seemed like it was perfect, the proverbial rug was ripped out from under him yet again.

After being excommunicated from the cult, the only world she had ever known at the age of 15, she put herself through\u00A0 school and then decided to join the military.\u00A0 As she climbed the ranks in the United States Army and made history for American women in combat, she realized that the two groups were not as different as one might think.\u00A0 Listen as we delve into the world of psychology, discuss the dangers of group think and ponder our similarities as humans regardless of our backgrounds or the trauma we\u0027ve experienced.
