      "description": "It all started with one profound question in the classroom: \u0022How could the German people sit back while the Nazis slaughtered those around them?\u0022 Ron Jones, their history teacher, found himself at a loss for words. He didn\u2019t have an answer\u2014at least, not one that truly satisfied him. The question haunted him, lingering in his mind long after the class ended.\n\nBut Jones wasn\u2019t just any teacher; he was the kind of teacher every student wished for\u2014charismatic, engaging, and deeply invested in their learning. Determined to teach them in a way they would never forget, he devised an experiment that would literally change their life\u2014one that would challenge not only their understanding of themselves but also our collective understanding of human nature.",
