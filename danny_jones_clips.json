      "description": "Flirty Fishing: How a Religious Cult Used Sexual Favors to Recruit Members. Dive deep into one of the most shocking and controversial recruitment tactics ever employed by a modern religious movement\u2014the Children of God (later known as The Family International). In this video, Ray Connolly uncovers the origins, implementation, and long-term consequences of \u0022Flirty Fishing,\u0022 a practice introduced by founder David Berg in the late 1970s that encouraged female members to use romantic and sexual relationships as a form of evangelical outreach.\n\nLearn how this method dramatically boosted membership during the cult\u2019s early years, the theological justifications Berg provided, the exploitation and trauma experienced by many women involved, and why the practice was officially abandoned in the 1980s amid growing criticism and the AIDS crisis. We\u2019ll examine primary sources, survivor testimonies, and declassified internal documents to separate fact from sensationalism.\nThis disturbing chapter reveals the extremes some groups will go to in the name of spreading their message and serves as a cautionary tale about manipulation, consent, and the dark side of charismatic leadership in new religious movements.\n\n#FlirtyFishing #ChildrenOfGod #ReligiousCults\n\n\uD83D\uDCE2 Subscribe for more: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ_piSR8gm-TfHZcDWOJciA?sub_confirmation=1",
