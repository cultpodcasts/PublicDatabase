      "description": "What if I told you there was a Utopia that turned into a Terrifying and Dark Cult.\n\nThis is a true story about the infamous cult that is Rajneeshpuram.\n\nWe will be delving into the historical context, philosophy, and impact of this Cult. \n\n\nSources\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nhttps://news.uoregon.edu/rajneesh_collection\n\nhttps://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=\u0026httpsredir=1\u0026article=1121\u0026context=usp_fac\n\nMusic from Suno AI and Epidemic Sound \n\n\nNote: The character Betty Olson is a fictional name based on a true story. I decided to keep the name anonymous as it was hard to fact check the story as there was countless cases like this. This doesn\u2019t take away anything from the story, as it was the general account for all of the 750\u002B victims. \n\n\nThis video took me 50\u002B hours to make.
