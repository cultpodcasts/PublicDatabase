      "description": "In this episode of Begin Again, Davina McCall sits down with the brilliant Deborah Frances-White \u2014 comedian, author, and host of The Guilty Feminist \u2014 for a raw and courageous conversation about truth, identity, and the power of difficult conversations.\nDeborah opens up about her early life in a high-control religious group and the journey of breaking free from the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses to forge a new life on her own terms. She shares the challenges of navigating identity, belonging, and voice \u2014 and how comedy became both a lifeline and a catalyst for change.\nDrawing on her new book Six Conversations We\u2019re Scared to Have, Deborah reveals why the hardest conversations \u2014 about religion, race, gender, money, and grief \u2014 are the ones that have the power to transform us. She shares practical insights for tackling the conversations we often avoid, and how facing discomfort with honesty can lead to deeper connection, freedom, and growth.\nThis is a conversation about reclaiming your story, challenging silence, and daring to speak the unspeakable. It\u2019s honest, funny, fearless \u2014 and an invitation to live with more courage and compassion.\n\nDeborah\u0027s Book Is available here NOW!: https://www.virago.co.uk/titles/deborah-frances-white/six-conversations-were-scared-to-have/9780349015811/ \n\n\uD83D\uDCE2 Drop a comment: What\u2019s your biggest takeaway?
