      "description": "In this solo episode, Dr. Mara Einstein follows the trail from Jonestown to Apple, to TikTok influencers, and MLMs, uncovering how cult psychology has quietly become a blueprint for modern marketing. What used to live on remote compounds now lives in your feed, your shopping cart, and the brands you identify with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Mara breaks down how vulnerable people get targeted, love-bombed, upsold, and turned into unpaid evangelists\u2014and why she believes we\u2019re not in an attention economy anymore, but an anxiety economy.
