      "description": "What exactly is a cult\u2014and how is it different from religion? In this opening episode, Dr. Mara Einstein sits down with Kathryn Lofton, one of today\u2019s most incisive scholars of religion and culture, to unpack how belief, devotion, and consumer behavior intertwine. From worshiping gods to worshiping brands, Lofton and Einstein explore how modern life blurs the line between the sacred and the sold.

Now a tenured professor of media studies at CUNY, she\u2019s dedicated to helping people understand how marketing shapes what we buy, what we believe, and even who we think we are.
