      "description": "As a psychotherapist, Vanessa has extensive experience with narcissism based on her own encounter with a narcissist in her personal life and so she offers not just the clinical perspective, but an extreme and very exclusive story of abuse. She has developed a coaching program based on her own experience and what helped her to recover from her psychological trauma after fleeing from her narcissist in the middle of the night. Her practice works to educate you on narcissism and what/who you are actually dealing with; Narcissism is categorized as a personality disorder by the mental health profession and is referred to as NPD or Narcissistic Personality Disorder, but it is FAR bigger than what is stated clinically in the DSM-V and few people are diagnosed because few people go to therapy. Vanessa ran across the state of New York in a wedding dress to raise awareness about narcissistic abuse. In this episode, she shares her unique perspective on narcissism and cults, the brain damage caused by narcissistic abuse \u0026 trauma and actionable tips for survivors.
