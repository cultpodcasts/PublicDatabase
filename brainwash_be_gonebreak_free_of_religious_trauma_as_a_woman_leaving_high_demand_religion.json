      "description": "High demand religions don\u0027t tolerate questions. Were you ever told to stop asking questions about your faith, and did it make you doubt your own judgment? If you\u0027ve grown up in or left a high-control religion, you may still feel a tug-of-war between your natural curiosity and the old rule to be quiet and compliant. This episode explores how discouraging inquiry erodes confidence, blurs critical thinking, and can put you in harm\u2019s way, and how reclaiming your questions helps you make clear, self-honoring choices. \u2022 Recognize the common tactics (appeal to authority, false dichotomies, circular reasoning) used to shut down inquiry, and why they\u2019re not about your worth or morality. \u2022 Rebuild trust in your own mind so you can ask clarifying questions, spot inconsistencies, and make informed decisions without fear. \u2022 Adopt empowering beliefs that honor intellectual curiosity as part of healthy spirituality and a fully human life. Press play now to learn how to honor your curious mind, set safer boundaries, and start trusting your own judgment today.
