      "description": "Have you ever been told to \u201Csubmit to your husband\u201D? This episode of Brainwash Be Gone unpacks one of the most damaging and normalized teachings from high-control, high demand religions and reveals how it impacts women\u2019s autonomy, self-worth, and relationships even after leaving religion. If you\u2019ve ever struggled with people-pleasing, self-censorship, or guilt when standing up for yourself, this episode helps you understand where that conditioning came from\u2014and how to release it. Clare explores how this rule strips women of adulthood, reinforces unhealthy power structures, and creates cycles of emotional and spiritual harm that extend across generations. Listeners will learn: - How the \u201Csubmit to your husband\u201D doctrine undermines personal sovereignty and reinforces control. - Why rejecting hierarchical conditioning restores emotional balance and mutual respect. - The empowering mindset shift that helps you reclaim authority over your life and relationships. Press play to uncover the freedom that comes when you step into your full self-authority and let go of learned submission for good.

      "description": "Have you ever been told \u201Cyour body is a temple\u201D in a way that left you feeling ashamed, restricted, or disconnected from yourself? For many of us, this is part of our religious trauma.

This episode reframes the metaphor so you can reclaim autonomy, rebuild trust with your body, and express yourself on your own terms. What you\u2019ll get from this episode: \u2022 Reclaim personal authority over your body and choices\u2014without apology. \u2022 Understand how shame-based modesty and purity codes fuel control, anxiety, and even scrupulosity. \u2022 Learn practical, compassionate ways to practice consent, set boundaries, and nurture genuine self-expression.

This episode explores how discouraging inquiry erodes confidence, blurs critical thinking, and can put you in harm\u2019s way, and how reclaiming your questions helps you make clear, self-honoring choices. \u2022 Recognize the common tactics (appeal to authority, false dichotomies, circular reasoning) used to shut down inquiry, and why they\u2019re not about your worth or morality. \u2022 Rebuild trust in your own mind so you can ask clarifying questions, spot inconsistencies, and make informed decisions without fear. \u2022 Adopt empowering beliefs that honor intellectual curiosity as part of healthy spirituality and a fully human life. Press play now to learn how to honor your curious mind, set safer boundaries, and start trusting your own judgment today.
