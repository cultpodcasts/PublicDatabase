      "description": "Have you ever been told to \u201Csubmit to your husband\u201D? This episode of Brainwash Be Gone unpacks one of the most damaging and normalized teachings from high-control, high demand religions and reveals how it impacts women\u2019s autonomy, self-worth, and relationships even after leaving religion. If you\u2019ve ever struggled with people-pleasing, self-censorship, or guilt when standing up for yourself, this episode helps you understand where that conditioning came from\u2014and how to release it. Clare explores how this rule strips women of adulthood, reinforces unhealthy power structures, and creates cycles of emotional and spiritual harm that extend across generations. Listeners will learn: - How the \u201Csubmit to your husband\u201D doctrine undermines personal sovereignty and reinforces control. - Why rejecting hierarchical conditioning restores emotional balance and mutual respect. - The empowering mindset shift that helps you reclaim authority over your life and relationships. Press play to uncover the freedom that comes when you step into your full self-authority and let go of learned submission for good.

      "description": "So many of us have been taught that to be a good girl or a polite woman, we have to be physically small and demure. and modest, and just really fold ourselves into the smallest space possible. We learn to shrink ourselves in both physical and more metaphorical ways. And the effect of having been conditioned to do that really holds back our true essence. This episode is about some of the ways we might be inadvertently making ourselves small, how we can overcome it, and the idea of taking up space as an intentional act to show up as our best selves in this world.
