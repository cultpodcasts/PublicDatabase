      "description": "A FUNDAMENTAL belief of Scientology is that 75 Million Years ago an ALIEN OVERLORD (called XENU) brought billions of ALIENS to Earth in SPACECRAFT (that resembled the McDonnell-Douglas DC8) and, after stacking them around VOLCANOES, he blew them up with HYDROGEN BOMBS. When man evolved (about 74 million years later) the ALIEN GHOSTS attached themselves to the newly formed humans and continue parasitize us today. Hubbard called these Alien Spirits \u0022THETANS\u0022 and Scientologists place considerable emphasis on NEUTRALIZING these Alien Souls and their ILL EFFECTS (i.e. MENTAL\r\nPROBLEMS AND DISEASES). As modern PSYCHIATRY doesn\u0027t take into account ALIEN SPIRITS, Scientologists reject this branch of Medicine completely.\r\n\r\nIn this video, a CNN reporter takes to the skies to view the huge ALIEN LANDING SITES that the Church of Scientology has carved into the ground in New Mexico. These strange symbols, like ancient NAZCA lines, can only be seen from the air. Adjacent to these carvings is the highly-guarded Church of Scientology\u0027s ARCHIVE BUILDING (which holds L Ron Hubbard\u0027s original writings transcribed for eternity onto Titanium plates). The whole area is HIGHLY SECRETIVE and the Scientologist\u0027s frightened off all the local pilots, who refused to take the CNN crew over the site. However, CNN managed to persuade one very brave pilot to take a risk. And this is the video that was filmed.",

      "description": "You may be surprised to learn that in America, one group enjoys a tax-exemption and special privileges from the IRS, privileges that go beyond those afforded to any other taxpayer.\r\n\r\nAlso surprising is the fact that for over 25 years, the IRS fought against this group in the courts, arguing that it did not qualify for any tax-exemption due to \u0022the commercial character\u0022 of much of the groups operations, and its \u0022virtually incomprehensible financial procedures\u0022.\r\n\r\nIn 1991, an unusual meeting was held between the leader of the group (David Miscavige) and the IRS Commissioner (Fred T. Goldberg Jr.).\r\nA complete reversal of the IRS\u0027 position came into effect in October 1993.\r\n\r\nA secret deal now provides this group with rights that exceed those of the average citizen.\r\n\r\nThis group and its associated corporations are known by various names, including: \r\nChurch of Scientology International \r\nChurch of Spiritual Technology \r\nReligious Technology Center\r\n\r\nFront Groups include:\r\nApplied Scholastics\r\nNarconon\r\nCriminon\r\nCitizen\u0027s Commission on Human Rights\r\n\r\nA New York Times investigation revealed that Scientology\u0027s tax exemption \u0022followed a series of unusual internal IRS actions that came after an extraordinary campaign orchestrated by Scientology against the agency and people who work there.\u0022\r\n\r\nScientologists are able to claim tax-deductions of a nature that is prohibited for members of any other group...\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Constitution upholds the principle of the separation of Church and State. The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment ensures Government policy remains neutral towards religious groups. According to the Constitution, one religious group should not receive special treatment by the U.S. Government.\r\n\r\nOn February 4, 2008, Judge Kim Wardlaw summarized the situation:\r\n\r\n\u0022The view of the IRS is that it can unconstitutionally violate the Constitution by establishing religion, by treating one religion more favorably than other religions in terms of what it allows as deductions, and there can never be any judicial review of that?\u0022\r\n\r\n\u0022This does intrude into the Establishment Clause. The whole point is Government neutrality towards religion, and that\u0027s exactly what the IRS is not doing here\u0022\r\n\r\nThe affidavit of Lawrence H. Brennan, filed on May 6, 2008 reveals that Scientology corporations deliberately worked to create the appearance of a religious group in order to gain a tax-exemption and hide its assets from outsiders. \r\n\r\nIf you feel that Scientology\u0027s secret deal with the IRS is an injustice to American taxpayers, please write to your Congressman, and inform others about this unacceptable situation.",

They worked seven days a week, often on little sleep, for sporadic paychecks of $50 a week, at most.\r\n\r\nBut after 13 years and growing disillusionment, the Collbrans decided to leave the Sea Org, setting off on a Kafkaesque journey that they said required them (1) to sign false confessions about their personal lives and their work, (2) pay the church thousands of dollars it said they owed for courses and counseling, and (3) accept the consequences as their parents, siblings and friends who are church members cut off all communication with them.",

Specifically, it involved a series of infiltrations and thefts from 136 government offices that were known to be critical of Scientology.\r\nIn 1979, eleven high ranking members of OSA, including its leader, Mary Sue Hubbard, pleaded guilty to obstructing justice, burglary of government offices and theft of government documents and property.  They were sent to prison for 8 months.  Hubbard himself, in hiding, was named as an \u0022un-indicted co-conspirator\u0022.\r\nIn this video, OSA covert operative, Mike McClaughry, talks about his role in Operation Snow White.  This involved stealing documents from the Attorney General\u0027s office in California.\r\n(This footage is converted from a damaged video and so, unfortunately, much of the footage is fragmented - although the audio is fine).",

      "description": "Scientology\u0027s latest public relations stunt has drawn criticism, as former members speak out about the organization\u0027s destructive policies. \r\n\r\nMultiple reports indicate that children are being exploited, denied a proper education, and are being separated from their families by Scientology organizations.\r\n\r\nMembers of the Sydney Church of Scientology swooped upon the Hunter\u0027s Hill Festival last Sunday in a despicable attempt to associate the controversial organisation with a legitimate police initiative focusing on missing persons.\r\n\r\nThe Australia Federal Police (AFP) held Missing Person\u0027s Week to raise awareness of an issue that causes immense heartache to families. The AFP motto reportedly read: \u0022When communication goes missing, so does our youth. Don\u0027t close the door to communication.\u0022 \r\n\r\nHowever, these public comments are in stark contrast to the official policies of Scientology. In the United States, the Church of Scientology has come under intense criticism for its practice of enforced \u0022disconnection\u0022. \r\n\r\nCritics claim this cult-like policy tears families apart, as Scientologists are required to cut off all contact with anyone who is considered by the Church to be a \u0022suppressive person\u0022. \r\n\r\nIn a recent report aired by ABC Nightline, the niece of Scientology\u0027s current leader spoke out against Scientology\u0027s destructive and coercive policies. \r\n\r\nJenna Miscavige Hill recounted how she rarely saw her parents, who were members of Scientology\u0027s core group known as the Sea Organization (Sea Org). \u0022What we\u0027re told is that they have to work so hard because they\u0027re helping other people. Your family isn\u0027t the most important thing.\u0022 \r\n\r\nAt the age of 12 she was pressured into joining the Sea Org, where she was made to work extremely long hours (12 hours a day from the age of 7) for little pay. \u0022I saw my mom probably a half an hour, one time, from when I was twelve \u0027til I was sixteen.  I saw my dad maybe three times, for half an hour each time.\u0022 \r\n\r\nAfter her parents left the church, Ms Hill was ordered to stop communicating with them, and she was prohibited from answering the phone in case they attempted to call her. \r\n\r\nAstra Woodcraft similarly was barred from speaking with her father after he left Scientology. She has since left Scientology and has joined Jenna Miscavige Hill and Kendra Wiseman in setting up the website exscientologykids.com to support children who have been harmed by the abusive policies of the Scientology organization. \r\n\r\nIn March 2008, Susan Lentsch issued a press release pleading for the Church of Scientology to allow her to see her daughter, Katherine \u0022Kate\u0022 Olson. Olson had repeatedly been denied permission to leave the Scientology facility where she works in Scientology\u0027s Sea Organization. Ms. Lentsch reports \u0022Kate was crying when she was put on the speaker phone to say hello to her grandparents.\u0022 \r\n\r\nFollowing the release of her statement, the Church allowed a brief meeting between the mother and daughter, in the presence of a Scientology escort.\r\n\r\nIn Australia, the Workplace Ombudsman and the Victorian Department of Education are investigating allegations that children as young as thirteen are being used as child labour in Scientology organizations, while being denied a proper education. \r\n\r\nThis investigation was prompted by the testimony of a whistleblower who went to the authorities with evidence of the illegal practice at the Melbourne Church of Scientology. \u0022At the end of the day, Scientology is a business - that operates as a cult  and pretends to be a religion.\u0022 said the informant in comments to the media.\r\n\r\nFormer high-level Scientologist Jason Beghe left the organization last year, and has spoken out against the abusive practices in Scientology.  \u0022What they do to recruit actors is one thing - what about the little children they get into the Sea Organization?  \r\n\r\nYou hear my story, and I got out and I got some sad tales and maybe I got ripped off for a good chunk of money. If you look at that, as compared to someone who joins the Sea Org, it\u0027s not even comparable.  A hundred hours probably is what the average Sea Org person works a week and then you get that for 50 years because they get them when they\u0027re teenagers. I mean that\u0027s taking people\u0027s lives away. That\u0027s enslaving somebody\u0027s mind.\u0022\r\n\r\nIn comments to the Australian media, Beghe said \u0022Everybody has a right to believe what they want to believe. But I don\u0027t believe that anybody has a right to trick anybody, to hurt anybody, to harm somebody for their own purposes.\u0022",

He had negotiated a buyout to leave the company.\r\n\r\nBut it now appears Fowler had no intention for Ciancio or himself to ever walk out.\r\n\r\nThe affidavit shows Fowler may have planned Ciancio\u0027s murder.\r\n\r\nEmployee Robert Read told police \u0022Thomas Ciancio started to become very frustrated with Fowler, saying he was embezzling money and a crook.\u0022\r\n\r\nA former employee, Stephan Samuel, said, \u0022he and Ciancio were able to see several large withdraws by Fowler totaling $200,000 to $250,000.\u0022\r\n\r\nSamuel says \u0022Thomas Ciancio did not like William Fowler taking the company\u0027s money and causing a financial hardship on the company.\u0022\r\n\r\nEmployees say that money went to the Church of Scientology. \r\n\r\nFowler\u0027s wife knew of the turmoil between Ciancio and Fowler.\r\n\r\nJan Fowler told police Ciancio had sent a threatening e-mail to Fowler, saying he was going to hire an attorney to get money owed him.\r\n\r\nShe told police \u0022Fowler is a Scientologist\u0022 and that he \u0022would not have gone without a fight.\u0022 She said Fowler \u0022probably would have grabbed the gun during the struggle and that William Fowler would have not just let somebody shoot him.\u0022\r\n\r\nFowler\u0027s wife also demanded a briefcase removed from her husband\u0027s office saying, \u0022it\u0027s important to me, my church, and it is religious material and I want it now!\u0022\r\n\r\nPolice suspect the handgun Fowler used was a gift from his son, Alexander, who had registered it at an address on L. Ron Hubbard way in Los Angeles.

      "description": "The manner in which Indian-origin psychiatrist, Raj Persaud, was suspended for misconduct has become controversial - after it emerged that the complaints of plagiarism against him were brought by a Church of Scientology front-group  the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR)  which is intensely hostile to Psychiatry.\r\nPersaud - a high-profile psychiatrist known across Britain for his frequent television and radio appearances - was barred from practicing Psychiatry for three months by the regulatory General Medical Council (GMC) after he admitted to plagiarizing the works of other academics in newspaper articles and a book.\r\nHowever, it has emerged that the complaint to the GMC was not brought by any of the academics whose work Persaud had plagiarized - but by the Scientology organization which is hostile to his profession.\r\nThe church of Scientology, founded in 1952 by American science fiction writer, L. Ron Hubbard, considers psychiatry to be useless at helping people cope with psychological disorders.  This is because the church teaches that all of our fears, anxieties and diseases are caused by the parasitic ghosts of dead aliens  and these dead aliens can only be removed by Scientology.\r\nIn addition, the Church teaches its followers that psychiatry was responsible for World War I, the rise of Hitler and Stalin, the decline in education standards in the United States, the wars in Bosnia and Kosovo, and the September 11 attacks.\r\nThe Churchs point of view on these issues is documented extensively in the Churchs magazines, books and videos.  In addition, the Church has created a museum which specifically teaches that Psychiatrists are responsible for the Holocaust.  When BBC journalist, John Sweeney, visited the site in 2006, he was so disgusted that he lost his temper with his tour-guide (Church Spokesperson, Tommy Davis).\r\nWhile suspending Persaud the GMC also noted that the psychiatrist had been praised by celebrity British television journalists and presenters, as well as former Foreign Secretary and Health Minister Lord David Owen.  Owen, a respected veteran of British politics, said he has the highest regard for Persauds skills as a popularizer and explainer of mental health issues.\r\nThe article that the Citizens Commission on Human Rights complained about was published in The Independent newspaper June 30, 2005 under the title A Dangerous War on Psychiatry.  In it Persaud wrote: The war against psychiatry was integral to the mission of the founder of Scientology, Ron Hubbard, since the publication of his first book, Dianetics, in 1950, and that it continues to this day. \r\nHubbard indicated as far back as the 1960s that one of the key enemies of Scientology was the profession of psychiatry. This small but internationally connected group, Hubbard claimed, was behind the lies and slander that both the press and government agencies received about Scientology.\r\nPersaud took the passage from American academic Stephen A. Kents The Globalization of Scientology: Influence, Control and Opposition in Transnational Markets.\r\nMeanwhile, David Nias, a British clinical psychiatrist, said the practice of plagiarism was so rife that an example had to be made of Persaud but added that such complaints were very rare.   Its something that is so rife, usually a blind eye is turned to it, or just a warning given, Nias told the Channel 4 television in a news report titled Raj Persaud - plagiarist or hero?\r\nIt is very rare for someone to be reported or punished for this, he said.  Because he is so high profile and a celebrity he was much more likely to be highlighted, he added. \r\nIn conclusion, it is clearly evident that the Church of Scientology has been scrutinizing all newspaper, magazines and books regarding Psychiatry and Scientology and has been waiting for a Psychiatrist of Persauds reputation to slip up.\r\nPersonally, I find fact that Persaud marginally plagiarized his colleagues work for a newspaper article and a book pretty trivial (especially when his colleagues werent bothered and when its so common).  More sinister is the fact that the Church of Scientology is closely monitoring Psychiatric publications with a view to Fair Gaming the author and destroying his or her career.\r\nIll leave it to the public  each individual - who simply has to ask themselves  if I start to show symptoms of depression, epilepsy, Parkinsons disease, schizophrenia or Alzheimers disease do I go to see a Psychiatrist - or the Alien Ghostbusters?",

This is because the church charges its followers $385,000 for this information.  Indeed, L Ron Hubbard, the cults founder, was so paranoid about the information being leaked he declared that should someone read it without paying, then they would die from Pneumonia!\r\nOne of the most sensitive Scientology courses is OT-III.  This deals with a sacred story of how, 75 million years ago, an evil intergalactic overlord killed billions of aliens from a distant galaxy on earth and how, now, these dead aliens possess humans and cause all of our fears, diseases and psychiatric problems.\r\nThe leaking of the Xenu story caused Scientology huge embarrassment and financial damage and they are very upset and angry.\r\nIn this video, former Scientologist, Frank Notaro, reveals that whilst he was picketing outside of a COS building with a sign mentioning Xenu, he was attacked and beaten up by a group of Scientologists irate with his sign.",

      "description": "We all know how the Church of Scientology likes to wheel out its Celebrity recruits in an attempt to give the cult and its arcane practices an air of respectability.\r\nLess well known, however, are the cults infamous Celebrity parishioners, which include no other than CHARLES MANSON, the lunatic who ordered his followers to murder actress Sharon Tate, entrepreneur Leno LaBianca and a number of others - and, whilst on trial, for carving a Nazi Swastika into his own forehead.\r\nManson was introduced to Scientology by Lanier Rayner, a cell mate at McNeil Island Penitentiary, Washington, in 1961. Manson became so obsessed with Scientology that he would speak of nothing else and, when asked by the prison service for his religion, he would reply \u0022Scientology.\u0022\r\nIt is known that whilst serving this prison sentence, Manson took over 150 hours of Scientology training.\r\nIt has been documented that when Manson was released from prison in 1967, he had developed a philosophy of life that blended Scientology with aspects of Nietzsche. Manson was so taken by Scientology\u0027s brainwashing techniques that he bought his own e-meter.\r\nIn addition, Bruce Davis, one of Manson\u0027s gang members, had also studied Scientology (in London), before he brutally murdered Doreen Gaul and James Sharp in November 1969.\r\nScientology tries to distance itself from Charles Manson. However, Manson\u0027s membership of the cult was confirmed by Paulette Cooper at the Clearwater Scientology Hearings in May 1982.\r\nThese Paulette Cooper tapes are available on You Tube.",

Moreover, and in addition, he discussed the fifty-plus beatings that he himself had received at the hands of Miscavige.  \r\nThe interviews became part of the paper\u0027s \u0022The Truth Run Down\u0022 special issue.  \r\nRinder said he was now speaking out because \u0022I don\u0027t want people to continue to be hurt and tricked and lied to by Scientology.  \r\nRinder also told how Scientology silenced critics, such as Bob Minton and Paulette Cooper, by digging into personal details, secretly recording conversations and fabricating criminal offences against them.\r\nMike Rinder now works as a car salesman in Virginia.

      "description": "This is a prequel to the last video I uploaded on You Tube.  Firstly, Id like to say that that the overwhelming majority of Greater Manchester Police officers that supervise Anonymous protests against the Church, or Cult, of Scientology are warm, engaging and fair.  I couldnt praise them more.\r\nHowever, on the May 10 2008 International Protest against Scientology a mounted police officer (Police Constable Price) and decided to Physically Assault and Verbally Attack over 200 Peaceful Protesters.\r\nHe confiscated my poster because it showed a picture of Lisa McPherson  purporting to be acting under section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986. He even impounded the poster after Id covered up the picture of Lisa. \r\n\r\nPC Price then aggressively moved the entire protest from its location outside the Scientology building into an obscure side street. He announced that if we didnt move, he would end the protest and arrest everybody who refused to leave. Liberty (and Greater Manchester Police) later confirmed that PC Price did not have the authority to do this. The hostility of this officer frightened many of the younger female protesters.\r\n\r\nAfter the protest was moved, I approached PC Price. In the course of a verbal exchange PC Price violently and without reason grabbed hold of my arm and dragged me to the other side of Deansgate. When alone, he threatened me with arrest, hand-cuffing and a beating in the cells. Both Liberty and Greater Manchester Police confirmed that I could prosecute PC Price for this hostility.\r\n\r\nMy official protest against P.C. Price was made to David Whatton, the Acting Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police.  He replied to my complaint within one week and promised that an official Internal Investigation would be made against P.C. Price.\r\nI met Mr Robert Meek of Internal Affairs a few weeks later and my close friend, Tony Leigh, came with me as a witness to the discussion.\r\nRobert Meek couldnt have been more pleasant and co-operative.  He told me that Officer Price had been given a permanent black mark on his record.  He also confirmed that Officer Price would be interviewed by Internal Affairs within the next 4 weeks. If I was happy with Prices response, my response could be resolved as a LOCAL RESOLUTION PROCESS.  However, if I was unhappy with Prices response, I could instruct my Solicitor to take Officer Price to Court in a Civil Prosecution for Assault and threatening battery.\r\nRobert Meek returned my Lisa McPherson poster in a very apologetic manner.  I was happy with PC Prices reprimand and the congenial and contrite attitude of Robert Meek.",

      "title": "Scientologist, TRACY FISH, attempts to have Doctor Chris Doyle Arrested in Frustration",
      "description": "Tuesday 24 November, 2009\r\nToday I received a telephone call from a Greater Manchester police officer regarding a series of postcards that Ive been sending to the Church of Scientology in Manchester for the past 12 months.\r\n\r\nThe officer stated that multiple complaints have been made by Manchester Scientologist, Tracy Fish, who has been demanding my arrest for being an irritation and a nuisance.\r\n\r\nThe police officer was extremely warm and engaging and assured me that none of the cards that Id sent were threatening or illegal and that no crime had been committed.  He also told me that he had recommended to Tracy Fish that if she wasnt interested in the cards then she should simply put them in the bin.\r\n\r\nThe following images show the Front and Back of the postcards that I sent to the Church of Scientology in Manchester (and to Scientology Orgs all over the world).  They reflect my greatest grievance against Scientology; the insensitive and heartless killing of innocent people like Lisa McPherson, Kaja Ballo, Noah Lottick, Eric Rubio, Shaun Lonsdale, Quentin Hubbard, Susan Meister and Konrad Aigner.\r\n\r\nThe only named Scientologist to have made an official complaint against me was Tracy Fish  and her name was mentioned to me at least 3 or4 times during our conversation.  Perhaps Tracy Fish is the only Scientologist in the UK (and in the world) to be annoyed by the receipt of my postcards.  However, I strongly suspect that Tracy Fish has been elected by Saint Hill Manor as the official complainant to the police.  This idea is supported by the fact that the officer stated that he had been given a bundle of postcards by Tracy.\r\n\r\nTracy Fish, and the Greater Manchester police, knew that I was the sender of the cards because I always attach a permanent sticker with my contact details onto each postcard.  This is so that my cards can be readily differentiated from other cards that might be sent to the Orgs  cards which may, for example, threaten violence, terrorism, bombings or the physical stalking of individuals.\r\n\r\nThe Officer who telephoned me did say that some cards forwarded to him by Tracy Fish were anonymous in nature (i.e. had been sent by an unnamed unidentified individual) and that some were indeed threatening in nature.  He also stated that some people had send cards in envelopes.  \r\n\r\nI ALWAYS SEND MY POSTCARDS UNCOVERED  WITH LISAS AUTOPSY PHOTOGRAPHS VISIBLE - AND SCIENTOLOGYS RESPONSIBILITY FOR HER DEATH AVAILABLE FOR EVERYONE TO READ\r\n\r\nI want as many postal workers as possible - and as many scientologists as possible - to see and read these cards.  My motive for sending the cards is to highlight the death of Lisa McPherson in the hope that, like me, they will research the subject further and discover the revolting and dangerous truth behind scientology.\r\n\r\nIf anyone watching this video is, similarly, interested in expressing their grievances to Scientology centers via postcard communication, then www.Vistaprint.co.uk is a competitive printing company.  Like all things in life, the more cards you buy, the relatively cheaper they become.  I buy 1000-2000 cards at a time, which works out at about 9p per card.  A minimum order of 100 cards would cost about \u00A315\r\nYesterdays contact with the police is not my first confrontation with them following a complaint by the Manchester Church of Scientology.  In May 2008, the cult had my The Church of Scientology Killed Lisa McPherson protest poster confiscated by the police.\r\nOn this particular occasion, the police officer involved was extremely confrontational and violent (see pictures on Tony Leighs most recent video).  The following day, I made an official complaint about this officers behavior to Liberty and to Greater Manchester police and, following an official interview with the police complaints board (which was also attended by my close friend, Tony Leigh), the officer involved had his service record darkened and my poster was apologetically returned.",

In addition, the program can take many years to complete.  Critics of Scientology, including former Scientologists, have compared the RPF with the gulag system of the Soviet Union.  RPFs sleep 12 to 20 in a dorm.",

      "description": "On Tuesday, October 27, 2009, a French court found the French branch of the Church of Scientology guilty of fraud and fined them $888,000. The suit followed complaints from two former Scientology members claiming they were \u0027manipulated\u0027 out of $33,000 and $73,000 for ritual products. French Scientology leader, Alain Rosenberg, was also found guilty of fraud, fined $44,000 and given a two-year suspended prison sentence.\r\n\r\nGeorges Fenech, head of French government anti-cult unit Miviludes, stated that the court\u0027s decision \u0022condemned [the French branch of Scientology] as an entity ... due to its fraudulent way of operating.\u0022 He further said, \u0022if they begin swindling again, they can be subject to dissolution in the future.\u0022 According to Fenech, this ruling \u0022is a historical turning point for the fight against cult abuses.\u0022\r\n\r\nThe Church of Scientology in the US and abroad has taken its fair share of blows since the 1986 passing of founder, L. Ron Hubbard. Wiki says Hubbard developed the body of beliefs and related practices in 1952 and incorporated the Church of Scientology in 1953. While Scientology has been granted tax-exempt status as a religion in the U.S., it does not have religious status in Germany, France or the United Kingdom. By definition, a religion is a system of human thought which includes a set of narratives, symbols, beliefs and practices that give meaning to the practitioner\u0027s experiences of life through reference to a higher power, deity or deities, or ultimate truth. Faith is belief in the absence of proof. Both of these key components, religion and faith, are under fire this week for the Church of Scientology.\r\n\r\nKnown for having a large celebrity following in the U.S., the Church of Scientology was shoved into the media spotlight when George Haggis, award winning writer and director of Crash, defected. His reasons for leaving the organization include Scientology\u0027s support of California\u0027s Prop 8 which bans gay marriage in the state, and an accusation of church policy ordering \u0022disconnection\u0022 or disassociation with anyone who leaves the church, family members included.\r\n\r\nScientology\u0027s recent run of bad publicity effects not just an entity, but individuals who have believed in the teachings of the organization. As spiritual beings having a human experience, we are all connected. The pain and suffering of one is damaging to us all. Agreement or disagreement among religions is an age old debate. But when it comes to the people involved ...the humans ... shattered faith can have a devastating impact on people\u0027s lives. These unfortunate issues in Scientology may be a golden opportunity for mankind to exercise compassion in an area that sometimes fuels intense arguments and spawns wars as people fight over the \u0027true\u0027 meaning of God and religion. Perhaps it\u0027s our chance to take one tiny step up the ladder leading to higher thought and spiritual ascension.\r\n\r\nIf today you stand firmly in your spiritual and religious convictions, ask for the healing of members and believers in Scientology as they navigate through this difficult flurry of events. Seek connection with their hearts and spirits on a higher plane and wish them well as they search for their own meaning in these tribulations. Nothing is by accident and there is no such thing as coincidence, so we must all know that it is for the greatest good of the universe when we are forced out of our comfort zone into areas where heat and pressure facilitate personal growth.",

      "description": "Hello, this is Anonymous.\r\n\r\nIt has been discovered by Anonymous that several high level managers within the Church of Scientology are currently working in the United Kingdom without the appropriate work permits. They are effectively working and living in the country as illegal immigrants. This information has been passed to the UK Border Agency, who are now mounting an investigation.\r\n\r\nThis Information concerns the following individuals:\r\n\r\nUS Citizen, Maia Dube, Commanding Officer of the Commodore\u0027s Messengers Organization UK.\r\n\r\nCanadian citizen, Janet Laveau, Head of the Office of Special Affairs UK, Scientology\u0027s Intelligence division.\r\n\r\nBob Bledsoe, of the United States. Commanding Officer of the Continental Liaison Office UK.\r\n\r\nJohn Danilovoch, of the United States. Captain of the Advanced Org Saint Hill UK.\r\n\r\nAustralian, Colin Davie, Commanding Officer of the Flag Operations Liaison Office UK.\r\n\r\nMelanie Schwandt, of the United States. Deputy Religious Technology Centre Representative UK.\r\n\r\nLucky Story, of the United States. Executive Director of London Org.\r\n\r\nInformation obtained by Anonymous strongly suggests that a scheme to attempt to circumvent the work permit requirements of the United Kingdom is being used on a regular basis. The source of this information is documentation that was carelessly discarded by a law firm retained by the Church of Scientology in the UK. This information has now been passed to the proper authorities.\r\n\r\nThe method to this scheme is as follows: Scientology staff members acquire a visitor visa prior to entering the UK, then just before this is due to expire, they fly to an airport within France or another country within the European Union. From there they fly to Dublin or Cork in Ireland where they stay overnight, getting the visa stamped in Ireland enabling them to travel back to the United Kingdom under another visitor visa.\r\n\r\nThe Church of Scientology will undoubtedly attempt to attack Anonymous for revealing this information and attempt to discredit said information.\r\nThis is to be expected. However, journalists and other interested parties should be able to independently corroborate it via other sources now that the technique used has actually been revealed. Anonymous is aware that this is a highly serious allegation.  However, the Border Agency of the United Kingdom is taking this matter very seriously. Anonymous suggests that any journalists who wish to follow up on this story contact the Border Agency for further comments and an official response. \r\n\r\nAnonymous also expects these members of staff to be reassigned as soon as the cult hears of this investigation. This may already have happened and if the Church of Scientology attempts to suggest that these people have already left the UK and never worked in the country, then this will be why. However, a paper trail and evidence of their actions will still exist and Anonymous is confident that the UK Border Agency will be thorough in their investigation.\r\n\r\nIt is not Anonymous that is guilty of crimes, but rather the Church of Scientology that has neither respect for the law nor personal freedoms. Their attempts to circumvent immigration laws is further evidence of this, as are the growing number of assaults perpetrated by Scientologists worldwide against Anonymous Protesters - several of which have been filmed and documented. The release of this information and the full co-operation of Anonymous with the Border Agency of the United Kingdom should speak for itself, and is in direct contrast to the Church of Scientology\u0027s disregard for anything other than furthering its own agenda. \r\n\r\nRegardless, Anonymous finds humor in the fact that the Church of Scientology\u0027s United Kingdom operation has been caught in this way. Furthermore, Anonymous will be informing other Immigration officials across the globe of the current violations in the United Kingdom being committed by the Church of Scientology. Anonymous promised new and invigorated tactics to be revealed on 8th August 2008, and as always, Anonymous delivers.\r\n\r\nWe are Anonymous\r\nWe are Legion.\r\nWe do not Forgive.\r\nWe do not Forget.\r\nExpect Us.\r\n\r\nEXPAND: download press release PDF\r\nhttp://img1.anonbw.com/press/888.pdf\r\ndigg it here:\r\nhttp://digg.com/world_news/Anonymous_...",

      "description": "James Barbour, the 41 year-old Broadway actor and prominent member of the Church of Scientologist, who was recently seen in the world premiere of A Tale of Two Cities, was sentenced in Manhattan Superior Court in March 2008 to a 60-day jail term and three years\u0027 probation, for pleading guilty to two sexual acts with a child.\r\nBarbour confessed that he lured a high school student back to his dressing room after she saw him in a production of Jane Eyre.  The actor - who appropriately played the Beast in Beauty and the Beast - revealed he touched the aspiring actress sexually.  \r\nHe then admitted to additionally arranging for her to visit him at his home on New York\u0027s Upper West Side, where he sexually molested her again.\r\nBarbour, who admitted to Judge Micki Scherer that he knew the girl was underage, agreed to enter a guilty plea in a deal with prosecutors which avoids his name being added to the American sex offenders\u0027 register. The sentencing followed Barbour\u0027s January guilty plea to \u0022two counts of endangering the welfare of a minor.\u0022 \r\nThe 41-year-old actor - who has also appeared on Broadway in Assassins, Urinetown, Carousel and Cyraano - The Musical\u2014 had been indicted in 2006 on NINE counts of engaging in criminal sexual acts, sexual abuse and endangering the welfare of children.\r\nHowever, had he opposed the deal, and had been found guilty on all NINE counts of pedophilia, he faced four years in jail and NINE COUNTS of acts of CRIMINAL SEX in the third degree. \r\nBoth sides spoke during the sentencing. The victim said, \u0022I struggled with complete lack of self-esteem, panic attacks, and put considerable distance between my family and friends for years. I had always blamed myself and felt like I had done something wrong. \r\nThe woman, who was 20 last year, came forward before the five-year statute of limitations expired, stated that she is pleased at the prison term and hopes that the sentence \u0022will prevent him from even thinking of touching another child.\r\nHowever, Assistant District Attorney, Maxine Rosenthal, speaking at the hearing, said although prosecutors were aware of an additional EIGHT CASES where Barbour allegedly had sexual contact with other underage girls, including one in California, these cases were not raised as a consequence of the plea bargain.",

At various times Hubbard and his followers have courted different governments \u2014 in the 1960s in Rhodesia (for which he wrote a proposed Constitution), and in Greece (with the would-be University of Philosophy in Corfu); in the 1970s in Morocco and later Mexico, where members of the government opposition travelled to Florida for counselling. China and several African nations have been approached, with offers of help with educational policy. Ron Hubbard would have liked to rule the world. He believed, and said, that benevolent dictatorship is the best political system, and saw himself as the only natural candidate. His successors possibly suffer from the same conceit.\u0022",

It premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 2001.\r\nDistribution of the film was prohibited by an American court order which resulted from a lawsuit brought by the Church of Scientology.\r\nAlthough the filmmaker says that the film is not about Scientology, The Profit was banned in the United States in 2002.  This was during the Lisa McPherson Trial.\r\nThe Profit is widely seen as a parody of the Church of Scientology and its founder, L. Ron Hubbard. \r\nThe main character L. Conrad Powers leads an organization called the \u0022Church of Scientific Spiritualism\u0022, and any elements about both the Church portrayed in the film, and Powers\u0027 life have been compared to Scientology and Hubbard.",

      "title": "WHY did L Ron Hubbard suddenly REJECT PSYCHIATRY",
      "description": "In 1950 L Ron Hubbard, an author of short Science Fiction stories published a controversial book entitled, Dianetics: the Modern Science of Mental Health.  \r\n\r\nThe ideas he presented in this book were unscientific, untested, unproven, irrational and often bizarre, yet Hubbard claimed that by reading this book everyone on the planet would be able to clear their minds of all their psychological problems such as fear, anxiety and depression.\r\n\r\nHubbard published the book intending it to be an adjunct to psychiatry.  At this point, Hubbard respected Psychiatry and had sought psychiatric help himself several times earlier on in his life and had actually used psychotropic drugs on several occasions.\r\n\r\nHowever, not unsurprisingly, Dianetics was rejected completely by the Psychiatric and Medical community and Hubbard took this rejection deeply personally and became intensely bitter and paranoid towards Psychiatry (and several other branches of the Medicine).\r\nSo, in 1969, he set up the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) to expose what he considered to be the evils of psychiatry.  \r\n\r\nThe ideas expressed by the CCHR are so extreme, bizarre, irrational, illogical and ridiculous that it is impossible to take them (or Dianetics) seriously or reasonable in any way.  In fact they are completely and utterly absurd, mindless, senseless and absolute nonsense.\r\n\r\nFor example, Hubbard (and the Church of Scientology) blames Psychiatry on the rise of Hitler and Stalin, on World War 2, on the Holocaust, on the attack on the Twin Towers of the World Trade Centre on 9/11, on the Virginia Tech shootings, on the war in Kosova and numerous other international tragedies.\r\n\r\nThis video explains why Hubbard abandoned and forbid Psychiatry.",

      "description": "Earlier this year, the Church of Scientology reached a new level of depravity when it released this advertisement.\r\nWithin days of its appearance, Kaja Ballo, a Norwegian student, committed suicide after Scientology found her ruin and then rubbed her nose in it.\r\nHowever, the controversial church has now sunk even lower by using wounded American soldiers in its new Dianetics book drive.\r\nJust as the church preyed upon the victims of the Virginia Tech shootings, Hurricane Katrina and 9/11, David Miscavige has now started to Steal Valor from American heroes in an attempt to generate revenue.\r\nAt Dianetics.org, there is a new promotional video showing an American soldier getting shot in Iraq.\r\nThe video shows a tense US soldier on patrol.\r\nNext, we see the soldier recoil as a bullet tears into his upper body.\r\nThe soldier then falls to the ground.\r\nIn the real world, the next frame would show comrades and medics running to aid the wounded soldier.  However, reality does not sell Dianetics books and that is the purpose of this video.  So, instead, we are presented with Scientology gobbledygook and the fictional concepts of \u0022engrams\u0022 and the \u0022reactive mind\u0022.\r\nThe next frame of the churchs video shows the soldier at a picnic back in the USA.  There are stars and stripes displayed and this video was clearly released to milk US patriotism during the recent 4th of July holidays.\r\nIn the next scene, a group of teenagers nearby light some firecrackers.\r\nThe firecrackers sound like machine gun firing and frighten the soldier. This represents the natural reaction of someone who has recently been shot.  However, Scientology depicts the reaction as a mental weakness called an engram and the video goes on to suggest that Dianetics can remove engrams and leave you in a state of clear (in which you no longer react emotionally to negative memories).\r\nSo why do I find this video obnoxious?  Well, its not just this particular video.  The church of scientology has a habit of milking natural and man-made disasters for its own benefit.  The church has been heavily criticized for turning up at the Virginia Tech shootings, in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and at Ground Zero following 9/11  and for handing out thousands of promotional leaflets and for getting in the way of true heroes (see my video Church of Scientology  SHAMELESS PARASITES).\r\nI also object to this particular video because it cheapens the deaths of thousands of American (and British) soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.\r\nI also object to it because engrams, the Reactive Mind and the state of Clear are Science Fiction (created by L Ron Hubbard, a charlatan 1950s Science Fiction writer).",

This is bad news for many of its followers, who are often disturbed or mentally ill.\r\nIn 2001, Jeremy Perkins, a 24 year old man from Buffalo, New York, was diagnosed with Schizophrenia.  His Scientologist parents (Elli and Don) sent him to Sea Org in California for auditing, but he returned home a few months later still experiencing auditory hallucinations, paranoia and delusional thinking.  \r\nAfter being found trespassing outside of the University of Buffalo on August 14, 2001, Jeremy was arrested and remanded to a local psychiatric hospital for treatment.\r\nHowever, Elli Perkins convinced a court to release Jeremy into her custody and, refusing to let him take his anti-psychotic medication, she treated him with vitamins instead.\r\nJeremys condition worsened and, in 2002, he attempted suicide.  He survived.  However, he started to believe that his mother was trying to poison him and, feeling threatened, he stabbed her to death.  Elli Perkins death has become a yardstick for everyone who sees Scientologys rejection of Psychiatry as sinister and dangerous.\r\nIndeed, Justice Anderson, of the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia, recently stated:  Scientology is the worlds largest organization of unqualified persons engaged in the practice of dangerous techniques which masquerade as mental therapy.",

      "description": "Reporter: Bryan Seymour\r\nBroadcast Date: May 29, 2009\r\n\r\nThe church of Scientology is fighting one of the biggest battles in its 50-year history.\r\n\r\nForget Xenu, the alien overlord, and Tom Cruise\u0027s bizarre outbursts - this time they\u0027re in court facing serious fraud charges.\r\n\r\nA woman in France alleges she was manipulated into handing over her life savings.\r\n\r\nBryan Seymour reports the case has ignited questions here about how Scientology minds its own business.\r\n\r\nScientology is under siege.\r\n\r\n\u0022Well in Germany Scientology isn\u0027t recognised as a religion and in France its leaders are facing fraud charges\u0022, said Nick Xenophon, the Independent Federal Senator from South Australia.\r\n\r\nIn Paris a court will decide if Scientology fraudulently manipulated a woman into handing over $36,000.\r\n\r\n\u0022The only purpose of Scientology is to take money from people,\u0022 said the French prosecutor in the case. He is seeking to have Scientology\u0027s leaders found guilty and fined over ten million dollars and to have the group banned from France altogether.\r\n\r\nThe French spokeswoman for Scientology was blunt in her assessment of the case: \u0022it\u0027s nothing really, it\u0027s bullshit really.\u0022\r\n\r\nShe added that the judge may have been influenced \u0022by the media and the climate\u0022 to allow the trial to proceed, which is a serious and unfounded allegation.\r\n\r\nOriginally four people were accusing Scientology of fraud but two of them came to a financial settlement with the organisation.\r\n\r\nThe woman at the centre of the trial says she was walking past Scientology headquarters in Paris in 1998. She was approached in the street and offered a free personality test.\r\n\r\n\u0022She was humiliated and defrauded for a long time, she bought cases full of expensive books and cassettes all cloaked in this goal of self-improvement to become this incredible person,\u0022 said the French Prosecutor trying the case\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, the test revealed she had shortfalls. She says she was told Scientology had the cure and was then scammed into buying books, courses, vitamins and even an electrometer, which is supposedly able to measure mental energy.\r\n\r\nScientology says the case is one of religious discrimination rather than the alleged fraud leading to members handing over their life savings.\r\n\r\n\u0022There\u0027s no witch-hunt, France respects freedom but even with religious freedom France can\u0027t ignore people breaking the law, if you have religious freedom if you can\u0027t do things that are above the law,\u0022 said a French Government official.\r\n\r\nAfter a nine year inquiry into the group, a French judge declared Scientology is first and foremost a commercial business.\u0022\r\n\r\nProsecutors allege the director of Scientology in France, Alain Rosenberg, and six other top officials preyed on vulnerable would-be followers \u0022with the goal of seizing their fortune by exerting a psychological hold.\u0022\r\n\r\nToday Tonight were contacted by a woman who claimed she had been recruited into Scientology as a child and manipulated into handing over a vast sum of money. When Today Tonight approached Scientology to respond to her claims, they said the woman had signed a confidentiality contract with them and they sent their lawyers scurrying to court seeking an injunction on the story.\r\n\r\nBut that\u0027s not why Today Tonight decided not to show the interview.  Her family asked that the interview not be aired - and Today Tonight agreed; her best interests should come first.\r\n\r\nFederal senator Nick Xenophon says it\u0027s time to re-examine Scientology\u0027s claims as a religion and to change the laws to force the group to start paying tax.\r\n\r\n\u0022We need to have a close look at those laws because I think there\u0027s a lot of community concern that an organisation such as Scientology gets the huge benefits of having the tax exempt status as a religion\u0022, Senator Xenophon said.\r\n\r\nHistorically Scientology brands anyone who questions their organisation a religious bigot.\r\n\r\n\u0022This is not about religious bigotry.   This is about accountability and I think it\u0027s pretty cowardly of an organisation to start accusing those that just want to question they way they operate, to make sure what they do is transparent, accountable and fair\u0022, Senator Xenophon said.\r\n\r\nAs always, the church of Scientology declined a request to be interviewed.\r\n\r\nNo doubt they\u0027ll be closely watching what happens in France.\r\n\r\n\u0022I think there is a role for regulators, for governments to have a very close look at these tactics because if they don\u0027t we\u0027ll continue to see more and more of these cases emerging where people\u0027s lives are being destroyed because they\u0027ve handed over their life savings, they\u0027ve handed over their inheritances to Scientology\u0022, Senator Xenophon said.\r\n\r\nThe cult information and family support network has branded Scientology a cult, not a religion and say ex-members can contact them for help and advice.",

However, this ludicrous philosophy means that the cult also rejects other branches of medicine too.\r\nIn this video, Roxanne Friend tells how the cult refused to let her undergo cancer treatment when she was diagnosed with a tumour. Instead, the church decided that they could cure her cancer with auditing (listening to her talk about her illness and then encouraging her to talk to the parasitic alien ghosts and persuading them to leave her body). Not unsurprisingly, Roxanne failed to get better.\r\nDisillusioned with the cults failure to deliver on their promise of a cure, she left the church shortly afterwards. However, before she died (from the cancer), Roxanne was interviewed by the BBC TV to expose the unscientific, unethical and bizarre ideas that scientology has towards medicine. It is likely that if Roxanne had received proper medical care when she first presented with the disease, then she would have made a full recovery.",

      "description": "Kaja Bordevich Ballo, aged 20, the daughter of Norwegian MP Olav Gunnar Ballo, committed suicide two months ago after been persuaded to take a free Scientology personality test. The family blames the Church of Scientology for her death and has decided to go public with the story. Ballo\u0027s Test results and suicide note were discovered after her death.\r\n\r\nOn March 28, 2008, Ballo, a student at the University of Nice took the Scientology personality test. A few hours later she killed herself by jumping from the window of her dormitory. Her friends and roommates claim she was in good spirits and showed no signs of a mental break down or depression prior to taking the test. The test was stamped and dated by the Church just hours prior to her suicide.\r\n\r\n\u0022I believe Kaja would have been alive today if she had not gone to the Scientologists,\u0022 says friend and fellow student Henrik M\u00F8inichen, 19, to Dagbladet.\r\n\r\nThe Church, which is located only meters from Ballo\u0027s dormitory, states that the results had shown Ballo was \u0022DEPRESSED, IRRESPONSIBLE, HYPER-CRITICAL and LACKING IN HARMONY\u0022 (results contrary what her friends and family report). The Church also states that it is \u0022unfair to blame Scientology\u0022 for Ballo\u0027s death and that the test is not dangerous and had nothing to do with it. However, the Church has since REMOVED THE TEST from its Norwegian website (an action strongly suggesting the test was responsible for Kaja\u0027s death). Kaja left behind a note telling her family she was sorry for not \u0022being good for anything.\u0022\r\n\r\nThe incident has generated criticism against the Church from friends, family members and politicians. Inga Marte Thorkildsen, one of the members of Norway\u0027s Parliament, told the Oslo newspaper Dagbladet that \u0022All indications are that the Scientologist sect has played a direct role in Kaja\u0027s choice to take her own life.\u0022\r\n\r\nPsychologists state that the \u0022Oxford Personality Test\u0022 used by Scientology has no Scientific validity and that it is deliberately rigged to produce poor results. The candidate, in the face of a disappointing result, is then encouraged to buy expensive books and courses to \u0022improve themselves\u0022. The test has no connection to Oxford University and the cult uses the title to give the test a false validity.",

Friedman stressed in his touching eulogy how the Church wrung every last cent from Hayes, including taking the gate fees from his unskilled live performances after his 2006 stroke.  These allegations, clearly insidious enough to defend his late friends honour, fall short of DIRECTLY blaming the Church outright for Hayes\u0027s death.\r\nHowever, there are a lot of questions still to be answered about Isaac Hayes\u0027 death. Why, for example, was a stroke survivor on a treadmill all by himself?  What was his neurological condition?  What kind of treatment had he had since his stroke?  Members of Scientology are required to sign a form promising that they will never seek psychiatric or mental assistance - but stroke rehabilitation requires the help of neurologists and psychiatrists, not to mention psychotropic drugs - exactly the kind of medical treatment that the church of Scientology forbids.\r\nIsaac Hayes may well still be alive today had he been allowed to seek the assistance of neurologists and psychiatrists following his stroke.

After his death, a controversy arose revolving around his parents\u0027 concern over his membership in the Church of Scientology. Noah Lottick had taken Scientology courses, and paid $5,000 for these services. After taking these courses, Lottick\u0027s friends and family remarked that he began to act strangely. They stated to Time magazine that he told them that his Scientologist teachers were telepathic, and that his father\u0027s heart attack was purely psychosomatic. Five days before Lottick\u0027s death, his parents say he visited their home claiming they were spreading \u0022false rumors\u0022 about him. Lottick\u0027s suicide was profiled in the Time cover story that was highly critical of Scientology, \u0022The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power,\u0022 which received the Gerald Loeb Award, and later in Reader\u0027s Digest. Lottick\u0027s father, Dr Edward Lottick, stated that Scientology is a \u0022school for psychopaths\u0022 and he blamed the church for his son\u0027s death. The Church of Scientology also haggled with him over $3,000 that Noah had paid to the Church and not utilized for services; they claimed Lottick had intended for this to be a donation. Dr Lottick later added that Scientology therapies were manipulations and that no Scientology staff members attended Noah\u0027s funeral.",

      "description": "\u0022According to a complaint filed in Florida federal court, an adult son, Kyle Brennan, visits his Scientologist father and he has with him a prescription to Lexapro for depression and social anxiety. The Scientologist father lives in a complex with other Scientologists and the father is instructed by a church chaplain to take away the sons Lexapro so he locks the medication in his truck. On February 16th with ready access to a loaded gun, the son shot himself in the head.\u0022\r\n\r\nHere are more details:\r\nKyle Brennan was born in Virginia in 1986 and was baptized a Catholic.\r\nHe was buried a Catholic by his mother, Victoria, in 2007.\r\nKyle died whilst visiting his Scientologist father (Tom Brennan), in Clearwater, in 2007.  Kyles father, being a Scientologist, and being apposed Psychological medicine, pilfered Kyles medication and hid it overnight in his truck.\r\n\r\nWhen Tom Brennan returned home that evening, Kyle had shot himself in the head.\r\nFinding his son dead, Tom Brennan called the Church of Scientology and, after a long discussion, they decided to send Jerry Gentile to Toms Apartment.\r\nJerry Gentile arrived 45 minutes later.\r\nJerry Gentile is married to Denise Miscavige (the sister of DAVID MISCAVIGE, the Head of the Church of Scientology).\r\nDavid Miscavige took the decision to call 911 and request an ambulance for Kyle.\r\nThis telephone call was made roughly 90 minutes Kyle Brennan was found dead.\r\nKyle Brennan, like Lisa McPherson before him, was declared Dead on Arrival at hospital.\r\nThe Clearwater Police found Kyles medication hidden in Tom Brennans truck the next day.\r\n\r\nKyle\u0027s father was more concerned with protecting the interests of the Church of Scientology that he was of saving his son\u0027s life. \r\nHe was also guilty of negligent homicide by depriving his son of his medication.\r\n\r\nIf you want to protest about Kyles murder by Tom Brennan, Jerry Gentile, David Miscavige and the Church of Scientology, \r\n\r\nIf you are outraged by the circumstances of Kyle\u0027s death, please express your disgust to the following authorities:\r\n\r\nAttorney Luke Lirot,\r\n2240 Belleair Road, Suite 190,\r\nClearwater,\r\nFlorida 33764.\r\nhttp://www.lukelirot.com/\r\n\r\nSteven E.

      "title": "Is DAVID MISCAVIGE implicated in the Death of KYLE BRENNAN?",
      "description": "In 1995, Lisa McPherson died after been locked alone inside a room for 17 days without food and water. \r\nWho locked her inside the room? \r\nThe Church of Scientology.\r\nFollowing her death, the Church of Scientology was indicted on two felony charges:\r\n1. \u0022Abuse and/or neglect of a disabled adult\u0022 and \r\n2. \u0022Practicing medicine without a license.\u0022\r\nHowever, David Miscavige, the Leader of the Church, hired a team of hot-shot lawyers to \u0022Fair Game\u0022 Joan Wood, the Medical Examiner. And, through intimidation and blackmail, they persuaded her to change the cause of Lisa\u0027s death to \u0022accidental\u0022. As a consequence, the prosecutions case collapsed.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, a 20 year old boy, Kyle Brennan, died suspiciously while visiting his Scientologist father in Clearwater, Florida. Kyle had a minor psychiatric condition but, when the paramedics arrived, Kyle\u0027s medication was missing. It was later discovered by the Police hidden and locked inside his father\u0027s truck.\r\n\r\nIt is now known that the Church of Scientology is being investigated for culpability in Kyle\u0027s death. Moreover, the Leader of the Church, David Miscavige, may be DIRECTLY involved and indicted. Here are the critical facts regarding Kyle\u0027s death.\r\n\r\n\u2022 When he found Kyle unconscious, his father\u0027s first call was to the Church of Scientology for advice on what to do.\r\n\u2022 A Senior Church official was dispatched to the apartment. \r\n\u2022 The official was JERRY GENTILE\r\n\u2022 Gentile took 45 minutes to reach the apartment\r\n\u2022 After an undisclosed period of time, TOM BRENNAN and JERRY GENTILE eventually called for an ambulance for Kyle\r\n\u2022 Kyle was already dead when it arrived\r\n\u2022 Who is JERRY GENTILE? He is the husband of DENISE MISCAVIGE\r\n\u2022 Who is Denise Miscavige? She is the SISTER of DAVID MISCAVIGE; the Head of the Church of Scientology\r\n\r\nFrom these facts, it is clear that Kyle\u0027s father was more concerned with protecting the interests of the Church of Scientology that he was of saving his son\u0027s life. He also put the church\u0027s policy if prohibiting psychiatric drugs ahead of his son\u0027s welfare.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it is virtually certain that through his sister, Denise, David Miscavige would have been aware of Kyle\u0027s death and would have been orchestrating the Church\u0027s response to it via Jerry Gentile.\r\n\r\nRegarding the imminent litigation, who is formulating the prosecution of the Church of Scientology? These people:\r\n\r\nAttorney Luke Lirot,\r\n2240 Beelair Road, Suite 190,\r\nClearwater,\r\nFlorida 33764.\r\n\r\nSteven E. Ibison,\r\nSpecial Agent in Charge,\r\nFBI Tampa,\r\n525 West Gray Street,\r\nTampa, Florida 33609.\r\n\r\nBernie McCabe,\r\nState Attorney,\r\nSixth Judicial Circuit,\r\nPinellas \u0026 Pasco Counties,\r\nPO Box 5028,\r\nClearwater, \r\nFlorida 33758.\r\n\r\nYou might recognize Bernie McCabe from the Lisa McPherson trial.\r\n\r\nThe information in this video was taken from the operation Clambake website:\r\nhttp://ocmb.xenu.net/ocmb/viewtopic.p...",

      "description": "Kyle Thomas Brennan died under suspicious circumstances whilst visiting his Scientologist father, in Clearwater, in 2007.  Kyles Psychiatric medication was missing when he was found dead; only to found the next day locked inside his fathers truck.\r\nThis video is intended as a tribute and a memoriam for Kyle.\r\n\r\nKyle Thomas Brennan was born into a traditional Irish-American family on April 2nd 1986. He was baptized into the Catholic faith at 3 months old and was laid to rest as a Catholic on April 22nd 2007.\r\n\r\nContrary to what the Church of Scientology reported at the time of Kyle\u0027s death, Kyle DID NOT die for scientology. In fact he rejected its beliefs as \u0022absurd\u0022 and \u0022ludicrous\u0022 (Kyle\u0027s own words).\r\n\r\nHowever, Kyle\u0027s father was a scientologist (based at their headquarters in Clearwater, Florida, where so many of their deaths have occurred).\r\n\r\nThe facts of Kyle\u0027s death are as follows:\r\n(1) KYLE WAS STAYING WITH HIS FATHER IN CLEARWATER FLORIDA WHEN HE DIED.\r\n(2) WHEN HE FOUND KYLE UNCONSCIOUS, HIS FIRST CALL WAS TO THE CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY, TO ASK WHAT TO DO.\r\n(3) THEY SENT A SENIOR REPESENTATIVE TO THE APARTMENT.\r\n(4) HE ARRIVED 45 MINUTES LATER.\r\n(5) ONLY THEN DID THEY CALL FOR MEDICAL ASSISTANCE. KYLE HAD DIED.\r\n(6) KYLE\u0027S PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATION WAS NOT WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS FOUND DEAD.\r\n(7) IT WAS FOUND THE NEXT DAY BY THE CLEARWATER POLICE DEPARTMENT - LOCKED INSIDE HIS FATHER\u0027S TRUCK.\r\n\r\nKyle\u0027s father was clearly more concerned with protecting the interests of the Church of Scientology that he was of saving his son\u0027s life. He was also guilty of negligent homicide by depriving his son of his medication.\r\n\r\nThe loss of Kyle - and his father\u0027s inhuman behaviour - will haunt Kyle\u0027s mother forever. Indeed, whenever she sees college students, she often thinks of what might have been.\r\n\r\nIt was Kyle\u0027s dream to visit Ireland, his ancestral home, and his family has never lost their love of its culture and its music.\r\n\r\nFor this reason I\u0027ve decided to upload an Irish song as a tribute to Kyle. It was Ireland\u0027s very first winner of the Eurovision Song Contest. The song is \u0022All Kinds of Everything Remind Me of You\u0022 by DANA. I also chose it with Kyle\u0027s mother, Victoria, in mind.\r\n\r\nVictoria has produced a beautiful homepage in tribute of her son and I hope you will all take a look at it.\r\nIt is\r\nhttp://www.kylebrennan.com/\r\n\r\nMuch of the information I\u0027ve included in this video description was taken from Kyle\u0027s Obituary:\r\nhttp://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Secrets/Ky...\r\n\r\nTO KYLE - FROM ME\r\n\u0022Bail \u00F3 Dhia is Mhuire duit\u0022\r\n\r\nIf you are outraged by the circumstances of Kyle\u0027s death, please contact the following authorities and request a statement:\r\n\r\nATTORNEY LUKE LIROT,\r\n2240 BELLEAIR ROAD, SUITE 190,\r\nCLEARWATER,\r\nFLORIDA 33764,\r\nUSA\r\nhttp://www.lukelirot.com/\r\n\r\nSteven E.

Jane\u0022 actor who left the Church of Scientology in April after 14 years, is testifying about his experiences today in Hamburg, Germany.\r\nBeghe has been invited by Germanys Department of Interior Affairs to be part of a three hour seminar on Scientology in Hamburg called, \u0022Scientology: Reports from the USA.\u0022 The program will begin with an 11 a.m. press conference followed by three hours of in-depth lectures from 5 to 8 p.m.\r\nThe conference is organized by Ursula Caberta, whose title is \u0022Head of Working Group, Scientology, Office for Domestic Affairs, Hamburg.\u0022 The evening will start with opening remarks by Dr. Stefan Schulz, State Counsellor at the Office for Domestic Affairs.\r\nAccording to the releases that have gone out, Caberta is importing a number of American Scientology critics including Beghe, who, last April, after he famously exited Scientology after 14 years, said that he had wasted $1,000,000 on the ridiculous cult. Also on the list of guests are former Scientologists Larry Brennan and Mark Headley.\r\nCaberta said in an email, \u0022This will be the first time that somebody from the U.S. General Consulate in Hamburg is coming officially\u0022 to one of her hearings on this subject. In Germany, Scientology is considered by the government to be a cult and a danger to the National Constitution.",

      "description": "Source: SPIEGEL Online International - January 23 2009\r\nA poster denouncing Scientology has gone up on a public kiosk outside the Scientology headquarters in Berlin. \r\nLocal officials warn that Scientology may be \u0022undemocratic\u0022 -- part of an ongoing battle between Berlin and the guardians of L. Ron Hubbard\u0027s arcane belief system.\r\nWith Tom Cruise in town this week to promote his new Nazi drama Valkyrie, a district of Berlin has quietly posted a warning sign near the city\u0027s Scientology headquarters, explaining that local authorities mistrust the organization.\r\nA public kiosk on the sidewalk in Charlottenburg bears a poster with a big STOP sign and a printed message: The district of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf expresses its opposition to the activities of the Scientology sect in this district and in Berlin and hopes that responsible parties in Berlin will watch the Scientology sect with a critical eye in the near future, and hopes that any illegal activities will be made public.\u0022\r\nCruise is one of the world\u0027s most prominent Scientology members. Posters advertising his new film, about the 1944 attempt by Lt. Colonel Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg to assassinate Adolf Hitler, are plastered across the German capital.\r\nCruise said little about Scientology during his publicity tour through Berlin earlier this week, and the poster doesn\u0027t mention him. It only says that local officials see \u0022a possible danger to democratic society in the increased activities of Scientology in this district.\u0022\r\nThe Scientology headquarters in Berlin opened in January 2007 amid national controversy.\r\nThe German government has never considered the US-based \u0022Church of Scientology\u0022 a religion, it refuses to exempt it from taxes and spies on it regularly for \u0022anti-constitutional activity\u0022 because of its aggressive recruitment practices. \r\nDuring a failed attempt to ban Scientology in late 2007, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00E4uble told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper, \u0022fundamental basic and human rights like the dignity of man or the right to equal treatment are restricted or abrogated by the organization. It rejects the democratic system.\u0022 \r\nSabine Weber, president of the Berlin chapter of the Church of Scientology, called Sch\u00E4uble\u0027s remarks \u0022unrealistic\u0022 and \u0022absurd\u0022 at the time, and a government poster outside the chapter headquarters will increase the Scientologists\u0027 fear of government persecution. \r\nSome lawmakers in Germany have said the government won\u0027t find enough evidence to ban Scientology, but acknowledge that its recruitment practices are \u0022problematic\u0022 because, they say, it is more of a business than a religion and, once recruited, it recognizes that it can be difficult for members to leave.",

He actually abandons the body; i.e. the being is really gone.  There is a difference between a thetan leaving the body and the thetan being unconscious.  When a thetan is unconscious, he will still be breathing and have a pulse.  But when a person has left, breathing and pulse will have stopped.\r\nPROCEDURE: If a person has done a bunk, you can simply order him to come back and bring his body back to life.  The commands are addressed to the deceased and should be given in a tone of authority.\r\nIt would be as simple as: COME BACK AND BRING THIS BODY TO LIFE!\r\nOr ordering the corpse: COME BACK HERE AND PICK UP YOUR BODY!  AT ONCE! PICK IT UP! I ORDER YOU!   RIGHT NOW!\r\nYou just keep commanding him with Tone 40.  He is still around and can be gotten to come back again.\r\nWell, if it worked for Jesus, I suppose it could work for the Scientologists.",

However, their local church banned this avenue of treatment and applied their own methods (known as Introspective Rundown), which involves isolating the patient from human contact, denying them food and overloading them with high doses of vitamins.\r\nThis failed to cure Aaron (as it fails with every psychotic Scientologist) and Aarons parents sought traditional Psychiatric treatment, which effectively relieved Aarons symptoms, and Aaron now leads a normal life.\r\nThis pivotal video illustrates that Psychiatry works whilst Scientologys alternatives fail and this has lead to hundreds of deaths (please see my Playlist for details of many of the victims of Scientologys Medical Malpractice).",

The officers confirmed all the inmates and personnel at the facility were gone.\r\n\r\nThe city says Second Chance vacated its property on the West Mesa without warning. The rehabilitation program was still housing 19 violent inmates as of Wednesday.  On Saturday night, no one was able to say where they are.\r\n\r\n\u0022I would hope that those individuals were returned to the counties they came from,\u0022 Chief Public Safety Officer Pete Dinelli said.\r\n\r\nThe abrupt closing stems from a landlord-tenant dispute between Second Chance and the City of Albuquerque. Pete Dinelli said the rehabilitation center violated the terms of its lease.\r\n\r\n\u0022They basically had people in there that had no business being there,\u0022 he said. \u0022The facility was never designed for violent felons.\u0022\r\n\r\nCity leaders ordered Second Chance out by the end of January. But the dispute appeared to be headed for court until Saturday.\r\n\r\nNow, the city must decide what to do about the bill they say Second Chance has not paid.\r\n\r\n\u0022It looks like we may be owed some money. Anywhere between $10,000, upwards to $90,000 in past rents as well as utilities,\u0022 Dinelli said.\r\n\r\nThe city said they may have to sue Second Chance to get their money.\r\n\r\nCalls to the president of Second Chance went unanswered on Saturday.",

      "description": "The Church of Scientology regards homosexuality as a Contagious Disease and Gays and Lesbians as Perverts and that should be Quarantined and institutionalized.\r\n\r\nAs cities around the world prepare for their annual Pride celebrations, it is worth considering the CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGYS official and socially obnoxious position on gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and queer people (LGBTQ).\r\n\r\nAccording to Scientology, such \u0022perverts\u0022 should either be quarantined and institutionalized, or go through extensive Scientology \u0022processing\u0022 until once again they have value as human beings.\r\n\r\nKeywords: In the Scientology cult\u0027s most sacred text - \u0022Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health\u0022 - written in the early 1950s, a modern reader is somewhat startled to find this passage:\r\n\r\n\u0022The sexual pervert (which includes any and all forms of deviation in dynamic two [sexuality and procreation] such as homosexuality, lesbianism, sexual sadism, etc) is actually quite ill physically.\u0022\r\n\r\nThe cult\u0027s founder, science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard, felt LGBTQ people were malicious, untrustworthy and incredibly dangerous to society. \r\n\r\nIn his follow-up book, \u0022Science of Survival,\u0022 he establishes a \u0022tone scale,\u0022 ranging from -3 to \u002B4, for classifying categories of people and evaluating human behaviour. \u0022Perverts,\u0022 as he classified LGBTQ people, fall at 1.1 on Hubbard\u0027s scale. He considered them to be extremely dangerous to society.\r\n \r\n\u0022At 1.1 on the tone scale we enter the area of the most vicious reversal of the second dynamic. Here we have promiscuity, perversion, sadism, and irregular practices. \r\n\r\nPeople on this level on the second dynamic are intensely dangerous in the society, since aberration is contagious.\r\n\r\nA society which reaches this level is on its way out of history, as went the Greeks, as went the Romans, as goes modern European and American culture. Here is a flaming danger signal which must be heeded if a race is to go forward.\r\n\r\nThe person may claim to love others and to have the good of others as his foremost interest; yet, at the same moment, he works, unconsciously or otherwise, to injure or destroy the lives and reputations of people and also to destroy property \r\n\r\nNo social order which desires to survive dates over-look its stratum 1.1\u0027s. No social order will survive which does not remove these people from its midst.\r\n\r\nSuch people should be taken from the society as rapidly as possible and uniformly institutionalized; for here is the level of the contagion of immorality, and the destruction of ethics.\u0022\r\n\r\nThe only solution Hubbard envisions to this horrifying threat is essentially converting them back to \u0022normality.\u0022 \r\n\r\n\u0022The only answers would seem to be the permanent quarantine of such persons from society to avoid the contagion of their insanities and the general turbulence which they bring to any order, thus forcing it lower on the scale, or processing such persons until they have attained a level on the tone scale which gives them value.\u0022\r\n\r\nScientologists of today believe in Hubbard\u0027s absolute infallibility  the cult views very harshly any attempt to suggest that Hubbard was not perfectly correct in everything he ever said or did.\r\n\r\nIt is simply not permitted to change even one word of Hubbard\u0027s writings, and indeed, the two books cited above have kept these insane and homophobic passages, through all the subsequently printed editions.\r\n\r\nScientology is much more than just a weird and wacky Hollywood fad, in which celebrities make fools of them and provide material for gossip magazines. \r\n\r\nBeyond its status as a \u0022religion\u0022 in the USA, which it obtained through a secret deal with the Internal Revenue Service, and which give it extraordinary benefits not permitted to any other group, Scientology is also a multinational criminal racket. \r\n\r\nThe average person would be shocked to learn the amount of influence Scientology wields, mostly due to blackmailing and intimidation of government officials. \r\n\r\nScientology\u0027s primary goals are to \u0022clear the planet\u0022 (of people like those at \u0022tone 1.1\u0022) and to \u0022obliterate\u0022 the mental health profession, replacing it with Scientology. \r\n\r\nThey are prepared to do this by any means necessary, and are adept in using their many front groups to portray the cult as concerned humanitarians. \r\n\r\nThe opposite is true. \r\n\r\nIndeed, according to L. Ron Hubbard, critics of Scientology are to be considered \u0022fair game,\u0022 and \u0022[m]ay be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist. May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed.\u0022 (L. Ron Hubbard, \u0022HCOPL 18 October 67 Issue IV, Penalties for Lower Conditions\u0022).\r\n\r\nThousands of people around the world are currently engaged in activism to make Scientology accountable for its human rights abuses, fraud, and many other forms of criminality.\r\n\r\nTo join them, please visit \r\n\r\nhttp://www.xenu.net",

      "title": "Scientology Using Cute Young Girls as a Recruitment Tool",
      "description": "On Saturday January 11, after a trip to San Francisco, two Girl Scouts were walking back to the train station from a gallery show when a pretty little girl gave them a cute flyer and asked them if they wanted a free Compact Fluorescent Lamp.\r\n\r\nAll they had to do was pick them up from inside the building across the road. \u0022Sure,\u0022 the Girl Scouts said. \r\n\r\nHowever, it got a little weird when the girl surreptitiously pulled a phone out of her pocket and made a call. \u0022I\u0027ve got two!\u0022 she whispered. \r\n\r\nIt was a rainy day, and, having forgotten their umbrellas, the girls were, at first, glad to get out of the rain. However, the girls entered what turned out to be the Scientology building at the corner of Montgomery and Columbus in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nThey passed the reception desk, where they were greeted by some very perky scientologists, to a table at the very back of the room, a good fifty feet from the front door.\r\n\r\nAdjacent to the table was a huge bronze bust of L. Ron Hubbard.  They were asked to write their names in a log book, \u0022so that the company that gave us the lamps knows we\u0027re not selling them.\u0022 \r\n\r\nAnd here\u0027s where things started to move off course: in the same breath, they were asked by another cute little girl, who also appeared to be a girl scout, if they had time for a tour of the Scientology building. \r\n\r\n\u0022No, thanks,\u0022 the girls said, and they started to head for the door.  \r\n\r\nHowever, when they were about halfway to the door, one of the reception desk Scientologists swooped over to ask the girls if they had heard about Dianetics  which was explained in the brochure he was shoving in their hands. \r\n\r\n\u0022Yes,\u0022 the girls replied, but we just wanted a free lamp, and we\u0027re trying to catch the next train. \u0022So you don\u0027t have time for a tour?\u0022 he asked. \u0022No,\u0022 the girls said, as they made a beeline for the door.\r\n\r\nBack in the safety of the public street, the girls laughed about their brush with Scientology and made a joke comparing Suri Cruise to the Messiah  \r\n\r\nImmediately, a well-dressed couple in front of them turned around and gave the girls a cold, hard glare that could have easily turned hostile.\r\n\r\nThe free lamp had come in a plastic bag with several other items. These included\r\n\r\nA copy of The Way to Happiness: A Common Sense Guide to Better Living (64 pages, by L. Ron Hubbard)\r\n\r\nAnd a copy of The Truth about Painkillers.  Once prescribed, these drugs open the door to a tenacious addiction and a life of dependency (22 pages, also by L. Ron Hubbard.)\r\n\r\nPersonally, I am so disgusted by the use and abuse of cute young girls to furtively attract more cute young girls to Scientology that words fail me.  \r\n\r\nIts clearly an act of desperation by the sinister church but, to me, this crosses all previous boundaries of indecency to which Scientology has stooped to.",

      "title": "Church of Scientology Seeking BAN on HIV\u002B Protesters",
      "description": "The Church of Scientology is urgently trying to push through a law that would ban HIV\u002B protesters from approaching its buildings.  \r\nScientology also obtained the private medical records of two protesters, who happened to be HIV\u002B, and disclosed their status publicly.\r\nThe Church of Scientology has requested an urgent revision of a recently revised Riverside County (California) protest ordinance in order to virtually ban HIV\u002B gay activists and others from free speech.\r\nThe litigation is covertly aimed at preventing human rights protest group Anonymous from protesting Scientology human rights abuses at Scientologys 500 acre Gold Base world HQ at Gilman Hot Springs near Hemet, California.\r\nLast Tuesday, January 6, the Riverside Country Board of Supervisors approved a revised protesting ordinance Scientology had hoped would effectively prevent Anonymous from protesting. \r\nHowever, the revision preserved Anonymous\u0027 right to protest in its usual position across from the main gate. \r\nControversy is on going about interpretation of some ordinance provisions and a six month review has been arranged.\r\nAnonymous first protest under the new ordinance was called for Thursday, January 8. It was attended by LA Times reporter David Kelly and just three protesters from Anonymous, all of whom happen to be gay.\r\nThey were anti-Scientology attorney Graham Berry, Scientology critic and comedian Angry Gay Pope and former Scientology staff member Happy Smurf.\r\nKelly was astonished that no sooner had the group gathered than five police cruisers descended on the site.  Some of the 500 Gold Base staff members had called 911 to complain that their security was being threatened by the three gay protesters. \r\nGraham Berry noted, It quickly became evident to me that the entire Gold Base was on lock down. All of the blinds and shutters were drawn. \r\nThe only people visible were the silhouettes of the two security officers in the guard house and head of PR, Muriel Dufresne, noted for purchasing gifts for  and corrupting  Riverside officials.\r\nApparently, Dufresne has also been observed surreptitiously recording Hemet City Council meetings. Additionally, she has sat on the Hemet library committee (as a sort of de facto Scientology censor).\r\nThe Police Sergeant in charge was polite and adamant that they were not looking to interfere with the protesters First Amendment rights.  \r\nHowever, for most of the next hour all five Sheriff\u0027s deputies were huddled inside the Scientology compound with Muriel and her assistant.  \r\nFrom time to time, various deputies would come out and engage the protesters.  First, they demanded - and then took - all of the protesters driver\u0027s licenses, recording the details and passing them onto the church officials.\r\nAlthough this is unlawful, it is constantly done by Los Angeles and Riverside Police when called to pickets outside Scientology locations. \r\n It was the first time in twenty years of journalism that the Los Angeles Times reporter had been asked for identification by the police.\r\nAt one point, the Sheriff\u0027s Deputies emerged and their Sergeant informed us that Scientology and the Riverside County\u0027s Legal Counsel had worked out an interpretation of Ordinances 884 and 888.  \r\nProvided we did not use the name of any living Scientologist specifically, and only protested Scientology generally, we could protest up and down both sides of Highway 79.\r\nThe three Anonymous members continued to do that while Scientology\u0027s representatives, the five Sheriff\u0027s deputies and the Los Angeles Times reporter went inside the Scientology compound.\r\nThen came the shocking revelation regarding the protesters\u0027 HIV status.  Scientologist Muriel Dufresne provided the Sheriff\u0027s deputies with the personal private medical records of Angry Gay Pope and Happy Smurf. \r\nHappy Smurf and Angry Gay Pope were forced to confirm that they are both HIV\u002B.\r\n\r\nThis is an utterly outrageous breaking of First Amendment rights and aptly shows that L Ron Hubbard was - and the Church of Scientology is  homophobic.  \r\n\r\nMoreover, the church claims that homosexuality is a physical illness and that it can cured with vitamins, saunas and auditing (talking about it). \r\n\r\nThe gay community should be livid over all of this.\r\n\r\nThe issues are serious and have been heightened by the filing last week of Marc Headley vs Church of Scientology International.  \r\n\r\nHeadley was Executive Producer of Golden Era Studios which produces Scientology promotional materials working at Gold from 1990 - 2005. \r\n\r\nHe is directly challenging Scientology\u0027s claim that Sea Org staff are members of a religious order and therefore do not need to be paid a minimum wage. \r\n\r\nHe is claiming compensation under California Labor law for the meager 39 cents an hour wages he was paid. \r\n\r\nThe suit is potentially devastating to Scientology and may become important in the interpretation of constitutional law.",

      "description": "I accept that this video will not appeal to everyone who opposes the lies of Scientology, but I believe that the truth regarding Jetts death is more important than the celebrity image of John Travolta.\r\nThe fact is that virtually everything the celebrity family of Jett Travolta has said about the teenager since he died has been fabricated.  Even the publicity photos of Jett they sent out after his death have been image-enhanced.\r\nThe constantly changing versions of the events surrounding Jett\u0027s death have gripped the public\u0027s imagination because it is so congruent with the story of his father\u0027s life. \r\nJohn Travolta would have us believe that he is just a regular guy; that he is not a member of a crazy cult; and that he is straight. Both are false.  Let\u0027s count the inconsistencies, which extend back long before Jett\u0027s tragic passing:\r\n1.Jett\u0027s parents, John Travolta and Kelly Preston, adherents of Scientology, have long maintained that Jett suffered from Kawasaki disease, an immune disorder which causes inflammation of blood vessels. However, Kawasaki disease is not linked to seizures, according to medical experts. \r\n\r\n2.When they weren\u0027t blaming Kawasaki disease, they publicly maintained Jett\u0027s health was fine, even though many in Hollywood believed Jett suffered from autism. And suddenly, after his death, we learn that Jett wasn\u0027t fine; rather, he was constantly supervised by two nannies and a baby monitor. \r\n\r\n3.Autism would explain Jett\u0027s disturbingly affectless appearance in public; about a third of people with autism also suffer seizures. Travolta and Preston are followers of Scientology, which believes conditions like autism are all in the victim\u0027s head \u2014 that they are \u0022degraded beings\u0022 requiring \u0022purification.\u0022  Preston has said in the past that Jett underwent a Scientology purification, which reportedly involves high doses of niacin. \r\n\r\n4.Police in the Bahamas said Jett, who was found unconscious late on New Year\u0027s Day in his parents\u0027 condominium and died shortly afterward at hospital, had struck his head, and reported blood on the scene. The nanny who found him, Jeff Kathrein, a Scientologist wedding photographer hired by Jett\u0027s parents, John Travolta and Kelly Preston, was once spotted in an intimate kiss with Jett\u0027s father.  Police said Jett was alone for hours, after last being seen the evening of January 1.  In contrast, a family lawyer maintained that Kathrein, who slept eight feet away from Jett, found him almost right away. A funeral director hired by the family said there was no sign of a bruise on Jetts head and that Jett\u0027s body \u0022looked great.\u0022 The cause of death on Jett\u0027s death certificate was listed simply as a seizure. \r\n\r\n5.Two chartered planes and a police hearse, ostensibly carrying Jett\u0027s remains, waited on the tarmac Monday, as Bahamian police blocked access.  It was a ruse: Jett\u0027s body was being cremated at the time, and the family planned to fly his ashes back to Florida on Tuesday. \r\n\r\n6.Jett, in reality, had a rounder face. But so what?  The need to airbrush away Jett\u0027s chin is a metaphor for the pathetic deceptions the Travoltas have engaged in. What they are covering up is not worth covering up. This is not some grand crusade for the truth  it is the simple and tragic tale of a young boy dying too young and we, the public, were always going to focus on that. These lies, big and small, that John Travolta has told aren\u0027t for Jett - they\u0027re for him to maintain his fake, perfect public image. He asks us, out of gullibility, to swallow it whole. I, like everyone else, wants to let the family grieve. But Jett Travolta is the only one who should lie in peace.",

      "description": "One person, or a small group of people, has the ability to change the world.  \r\nSometimes their ideas are initially regarded as outlandish, impossible or even crazy but, ultimately, they are proved correct and the world is never the same again.\r\nFor example, take Galileo who was ridiculed for stating that the Earth was not the centre of the Universe.  \r\nOr Benjamin Franklin, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States of America.  Who was also a leading author, printer, political theorist, politician, scientist, inventor, civic activist, statesman and diplomat.\r\nThen there is Isaac Newton, who, regarded as an unpopular renegade, formulated Mathematical Calculus, the Laws of Motion and Gravitational theory and enabled man to walk on the Moon.\r\nFinally, being Irish, my personal favourite is the leading Irish rebel and member of the 1916 uprising, Michael Collins.  It was Michael Collins who, miraculously, achieved Independence for the Republic of Ireland through negotiation with Lloyd George and Winston Churchill in 1921.\r\nIt is my conviction that through perseverance, protest and by educating the public, Anonymous can change the world by forcing profound change within the church of Scientology.",

      "description": "When Katie Holmes Broadway show All My Sons opens on October 16, ticket holders wont be the only ones in attendance. The anti-Scientology group ANONYMOUS will be on hand for Holmes Broadway debut as well. \r\nThe group, highly critical of Scientology, plans to stage protests at the opening of Katie\u0027s Broadway show to save Katie\u0027 from Scientology. \r\nA spokesperson for the Anonymous organization said told MSNBC, \u0022We aren\u0027t looking to close the play down - we don\u0027t have the power or inclination to do that - we just want to tell the theatre-going people of New York about the Crimes, Human Rights Violations and Deaths perpetrated by the Scientology Cult.\r\n\u0022We want to draw attention to Scientology, and hopefully get Katie out of it before its too late and shes completely brain-washed.\u0022 \r\nAnonymous claims to be a collection of individuals united by ideals and be acting as the conscience of the Internet. So far, its activities have closed down the Scientology Org in Dusseldorf, resulted in the closing of the white-supremacist radio show produced by Hal Turner, has prompted the criminal prosecution of Canadian and American pedophiles Chris Forcand and James Barbour and has devastated Scientologys financial income and the recruitment of new members.\r\nAnonymous protests, when they take place, are easy to spot thanks to the tell-tale masks that members wear. The group, which calls itself a leaderless worldwide group of concerned citizens, recently picketed the Scientology Center on West 46th Street in New York as part of an International day of protest involving over 120 Scientology buildings world-wide.\r\nMembers of the group wear masks when protesting to protect their identities and, thereby, preclude social, political, and financial risks, because Scientology is a \u0022dangerous cult\u0022 with \u0022a well earned reputation for harassing, attacking and destroying critics at their homes and workplaces.\u0022\r\nHowever, of the groups plans to picket the All My Sons opening, the Anonymous spokesperson said their principle aim was to save Katie. We want to draw attention to Scientology, and hopefully get Katie out of it before its too late.",

      "description": "The number of people who have DIED as a result of their association with the \u0022Church\u0022 of Scientology is immense. It is certainly in the hundreds; it is perhaps over one thousand.\r\n\r\nMembers with physical and mental health problems are often persuaded to totally abandon their doctor\u0027s treatment in favour of vitamins and auditing (talking to their thetans); they have, consequently, died, or have caused the deaths of others.\r\n\r\nOne of the most avoidable deaths was that of Lisa McPherson. Lisa was taken to Hospital by Paramedics after taking off her clothes and walking down the street naked. Before she could receive PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT, however, the local Church of Scientology (Clearwater, Florida) removed her from the hospital and \u0022prescribed\u0022 INTROSPECTIVE RUNDOWN to cure her problems. This involved locking Lisa in a room at the Fort Harrison Hotel (owned by the Church) all by herself for 17 days. During this time, she was denied communication with others, food and water. Lisa lost 45lbs, lost consciousness, was bitten repeatedly by cockroaches and, eventually, died from dehydration.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, when Heribert Pfaff was denied his medication for epilepsy (in favour of vitamins and minerals); he died from a Grand Mal Seizure.\r\n\r\nWhen Schizophrenic, Jeremy Perkins, was taken off his medication by his mother, Elli (a practising Scientologist), he became paranoid and delusional. Believing that she was trying to poison him, he stabbed her 77 times with a kitchen knife.\r\n\r\nA number of CRITICS of Scientology have died under mysterious circumstances. The most recent of these is SHAWN LONSDALE, who was found dead in his car in February 2008.\r\n\r\nThis video pays tribute to many of the dead victims of Scientology.\r\n\r\nFor more information regarding the deaths for which the \u0022Church\u0022 of Scientology is culpable, please check out the following link:\r\nwww.whyaretheydead.net/",

People deemed to have hidden evil intentions (detected by the E-meter).\r\n2. People who were unproductive and scored poorly on the personality test.\r\n3. Repeated \u0022stat crashers\u0022 (people who were held responsible for declines in Scientology organizations\u0027 productivity)\r\n4. \u0022Overt product makers\u0022 (people who produced poor-quality work).\r\n5. People who spoke against any member of the church or church activity (declared a Suppressive Person).\r\n\r\nIn the RPF you are held AGAINST YOUR WILL for months or even years. There is no release until you are declared \u0022REDEEMED\u0022. If you are committed to an RPF late in your life, you might just die there (and be CREMATED before your family are informed of your death). \r\nYou will UNDERGO HARD LABOUR to- and beyond -- exhaustion. YOU HAVE TO RUN EVERYWHERE (WHILST CARRYING HEAVY WEIGHTS). You will be ordered to perform BIZARRE PHYSICAL TASKS, such as carrying buckets filled with sand up and down a ladder. You wear a PRISON UNIFORM to identify you as a CRIMINAL and to DEMEAN YOU. In the RPF you are FORBIDDEN ANY CONTACT WITH YOUR SPOUSE AND CHILDREN. In addition, whilst in the RPF, you are YOU ARE BILLED FOR EVERY SINGLE DAY YOU SPEND IN INCARCERATION AND FOR EVERY COURSE OF TREATMENT YOU RECEIVE.\r\n\r\nThese facts were confirmed in an investigative article in the LOS ANGELES TIMES (\u0022In interviews and public records, former staff and inmates have said they were alienated from society, stripped of familiar beliefs, punished for aberrant behaviour, rewarded for conformity (brain-washing), and worked beyond exhaustion.\u0022 (June 26, 1990, p.

      "description": "The tragic death of John Travolta\u0027s teenage son, Jett, could spell the end of Scientologys (and L. Ron Hubbard\u0027s) loopy, medicine-hating cult initiated in the 1950s.\r\nJett\u0027s parents, John Travolta and Kelly Preston, are both declared to be \u0022clear\u0022 - an exalted, expensively attained status in Scientology of completely perfect health and psychological flawlessness.\r\nCritics of Scientology have long known that the pseudo-religion, based on Hubbard\u0027s Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health, discourages adherents from seeking medical help for problems they deem \u0022psychosomatic.\u0022 \r\nThat old line about it being all in your head forms the basis of Scientology\u0027s weird belief system; most problems, even if they manifest themselves physically, are spiritual in nature, stemming from the patient\u0027s \u0022reactive mind.\u0022\r\nEven aspirin is deemed a mood-altering drug to be avoided  which is too bad if you need take it to prevent further blood clots from forming following a stroke or a heart attack. \r\nHence the controversy over Jett Travolta\u0027s apparent death from a head injury, most likely incurred after he suffered a seizure in the Bahamas hotel where the Travolta family were staying.\r\nJohn Travolta and Kelly Preston have long claimed Jett developed Kawasaki disease after exposure at a young age to carpet-cleaning chemicals; an allegation that medical experts find implausible.\r\nThe media has speculated for years that Jett was Autistic and was being denied essential psychiatric medication for seizures due to L. Ron Hubbards arcane ban on medication.\r\nAt the time of his death, Jett was under the care of Jeff Kathrein, a wedding photographer whose main qualification for the nanny post seemed to be a course he completed in Scientology and a kiss he shared with Jett Travolta.\r\nWhatever the cause of his seizures, a Travolta family lawyer now says Jett that had been taking Depakote, an anti-seizure medication, but had to stop because of liver damage. \r\nTravolta\u0027s actor friend Tom Cruise has made the church\u0027s stance infamous through his wildly unpopular tour of the talk shows in which he tried to advance Scientology\u0027s anti-psychiatry views. \r\nHis badgering of NBC\u0027s Matt Lauer on the Today show pales in comparison to his crazy-laughing-guy turn in a private Scientology video. \r\nHe\u0027s since declared that he\u0027s not going to share his Scientologist beliefs with the public, a decision which seems to have boosted box-office returns for Valkryie, his latest film.\r\nThis is good for Cruise and GREAT NEWS for Scientologists who may wish to take medication for their own or their childrens illnesses.\r\nHowever, it is bad news for Scientology, which desperately needs Cruise\u0027s star power to spread the church\u0027s message - as well as his money.  Rumor has it that the church, once a financial powerhouse, is said to be strapped for cash.\r\nTravolta and Preston surely loved Jett, and are as grieved by his death as any parent would be. But the accusation will linger that they privileged their adherence to Scientology over their devotion to their son. \r\nThe death of Lisa McPherson, a 36-year-old Florida Scientologist who died after church members removed her from a hospital where she was due to receive psychological care, initially received little attention outside of local newspapers. \r\nJett Travolta\u0027s death, on the other hand, is winning international attention, and raising the question of Scientology\u0027s anti-medicine stance.",

      "description": "By now almost everyone in the world will be aware of the terrible death of John Travolta\u0027s 16-year-old son Jett on a family holiday in the Bahamas.\r\n\r\nAnti-scientology campaigners claim that Jett - who apparently died after hitting his head in the bathroom following a seizure - suffered from autism and the seizure was a consequence of this illness.\r\n\r\nThe Travoltas have always denied Jett was Autistic because, as Scientologists, they fail to recognize the existence of the disease.  \r\n\r\nThe Church of Scientology disapproves of all psychiatric and drug treatment of autism, just as it rejects all psychiatry as pseudo-science.\r\n\r\nThey believe that the symptoms of the medical condition Autism are created by parasitic alien ghosts that can only be removed by auditing with an e-meter.\r\n\r\nNow, here\u0027s the potential bombshell. Anti-Scientology sites are currently linking Jetts death to a gossip website dating from November 2007, which apparently predicted Jett\u0027s death because his supposed autism was not being treated.\r\n\r\nHere is the link: http://www.wwtdd.com/post.phtml?pk=2268\u0026page_number=2 \r\n\r\nI can\u0027t promise that it will be working by the time you click on it as the Church of Scientology will be keen to remove all websites regarding Jetts death.\r\n\r\nAlso, you should look at this article:\r\nhttp://forums.whyweprotest.net/298-jett-travolta/what-scientology-will-probably-do-about-tragic-death-jett-travolta-35106/#post673351\r\n\r\nThis was posted by a member of the anti-Scientology group Anonymous, entitled \u0022What Scientology will probably do about the death of Jett Travolta\u0022. \r\n\r\nA third article that you should read is this:\r\nhttp://anonforgreatjustice.blogspot.com/2009/01/michael-pattinson-what-scientology-will.html\r\n\r\nI sense that Jetts tragic death could bring about a huge demise in the popularity of Scientology. I could be wrong and maybe I\u0027m being exploitative. But certain questions need answering  and with all respect to the bereaved parents - they must be asked.",

      "description": "Scientology prince, Tom Cruise, is supposedly no longer speaking publicly about his membership in the cult - a far cry from the days he used new films as a chance to promote the \u0022church.\r\nThe actor gave an interview to Britain\u0027s most popular newspaper, THE SUN, Sun, which today reports: Stung by negative comments about the religious movement, which has been accused of being a cult, Cruise insists he no longer wishes to talk about his beliefs. \r\nHe said: I say, Thats it, no more \u2014 if you want to know about Scientology go to the Scientology website!\r\nOn the TODAY show earlier this month, Cruise stated that he was done talking about Scientology, and just preferred to plug his new movie VALKYRIE.\r\nHe Stated, Ive been a Scientologist for 25 years and I think theres a time and place for it. When people are tuning in to hear about my movie, then thats what I should here to talk about.\r\nEither way, Cruise has definitely become more bashful about his Scientology ties than he was just a few years ago. He sponsored a \u0022Scientology tent on the set of the film \u0022War of the Worlds\u0022 in 2005.\r\nIn addition, he took 20 managers from \u0022War of the Worlds\u0022 distributor United International Pictures on a four-hour tour of three different Scientology facilities - specifically so they could more effectively field press inquiries about Scientology.\r\nHowever, that was back when fanatical Scientologist, Lee Anne De Vette, Cruise\u0027s sister, was doing the actor\u0027s publicity. \r\nIt now sounds like Cruise is waking up and smelling the coffee and realizing that the Religion is adversely affecting his career.\r\nIn addition, he has probably finally realized that Scientology is a waste of his time, his $100 Million in donations have failed to deliver him any supernatural powers, theres no such thing as Xenu   and its cellular defects that cause schizophrenia, epilepsy and cancer rather than parasitic alien ghosts.",

      "description": "An American court ruled this week that an Orthodox Jewish couple could not use tax deductions that Scientologists can use (deductions they obtained by way of a secret 1993 agreement with the Internal Revenue Service). \r\nIn the case Sklar v. Commissioner of the IRS, Michael and Marla Sklar tried to claim their childrens tuition for their Jewish day school as a tax deduction.\r\nHowever, their argument was rejected by the US Ninth Circuit Court because it violates the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, which states in the first sentence that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\r\nThe Sklars main argument was that section 170(f)(8) and 6115 of the IRS code authorized deductions for donations made to religious institutions if they provided intangible religious benefits. \r\nScientologists can claim deductions for religious services provided by the Church, and the Sklars argued that they too should be allowed to utilize this benefit. \r\nIf the Church of Scientology is allowed to violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, then Jews should be able to do the same thing in the name of consistency. \r\nThe court ruled in favor of not violating the First Amendment, which unequivocally states that no religion should have an advantage over the other. \r\nHowever, the Church of Scientologys uniquely enjoys this special privilege, which they allegedly obtained by shady means. \r\nThree years after the Church was established by L. Ron Hubbard in 1953, the IRS gave it tax-exempt status. \r\nHowever, in 1967, their tax-exempt status was stripped away because it was determined that the activities of the Church were commercial, and several US courts agreed. \r\nThis meant war between the IRS and the Church, which continued for 25 years.\r\nIn 1973, L. Ron Hubbard initiated Operation Snow White against the governments of several countries, including the United States. The main target of Project Hunter, the American branch of Snow White, was the IRS. \r\nOperation Snow White called for the infiltration of the IRS and other US government agencies in order to steal documents related to L. Ron Hubbard and the Church of Scientology. \r\nEventually, several Scientologists, including L. Ron Hubbards wife Mary Sue, were caught, and the FBI invaded Scientology offices in Los Angeles and Washington DC. \r\nIn 1979, eleven Scientologists, including Mary Sue Hubbard, were sentenced to five years in prison. \r\nThat did not stop the war against the IRS. Private investigators were hired by the cult to dig up dirt on various IRS officials, and in many cases, they found enough damning evidence to blackmail these officials.\r\nFinally, in 1993, then IRS Comissioner Fred Goldberg met with current Church leader David Miscavige and reached an agreement that would end all lawsuits against the IRS by the Church of Scientology: the war was finally over. \r\nAttempts by various IRS watchdogs to get the IRS to disclose this agreement have been unsuccessful, even though by law the IRS has to release it.\r\nThe question to ask is: why is a pseudo-religion started by a charlatan solely to make money allowed these special privileges, while legitimate religions are not? \r\nIll leave you with the relevant quote from L. Ron Hubbard, Somebody, some day, will say - this is illegal. By then the orgs will say what is legal or not.",

      "description": "The hideous Church of Scientology has been banned from a Midland shopping centre after a string of complaints that they had been stalking children. \r\n\r\nChurch leaders, understood to be from Birmingham, had set up a stall at Wolverhampton\u0027s Wulfrun Centre after making a booking under the name of Dianetics (the title of the cult\u0027s first book). \r\n\r\nThe Head of the Shopping Centre ordered the preachers to pack up and leave after angry parents said their children had been encouraged to take part in \u0022personality tests\u0022 - and then attempted to be indoctrinated into the religion. \r\n\r\n\u0022We had complaints that kids had been invited to take part in a stress test and were then asked questions about religion and their relationships with their parents\u0022 said operations manager Colin Quinton. \u0022We told them that we\u0027d had complaints, and we wouldn\u0027t be inviting them back. It didn\u0027t seem like a religious set-up and we wouldn\u0027t have allowed them in if we had realized who they were. We try and stay neutral on issues of politics and religion.\u0022 \r\n\r\nThe event, on Saturday, June 28, was understood to be part of a huge recruitment drive by Scientologists across Birmingham and the Black Country. \r\n\r\nThe controversial church includes Hollywood actor Tom Cruise among its supporters. Growing numbers of followers in Birmingham have submitted plans unveiled to spend \u00A34.25 million to turn Moseley\u0027s Grade II-listed Pitmaston building into the Midlands HQ for the church. \r\n\r\nGraeme Wilson, the church\u0027s public affairs director, said: \u0022The Wulfrun has adopted a policy of having no religious organizations at the centre (SO WHY DID THE SCIENTOLOGISTS TURN UP?). Scientologist, Graeme Wilson stated (inaccurately) \u0022Apparently there was one complaint by one person, who didn\u0027t identify himself, saying he had seen children approached and offered stress tests \u0022I understand that he did not claim to be a parent of any such children, and no evidence has been presented. \r\n\r\n\u0022Our stress tests are not offered to children,\u0022 Mr. Wilson added. However, this is clearly A FRAUDULENT LIE as a recent video in Cincinnati showed Scientologists specifically targeting children and quizzing them about their relationships with their parents and what physical punishments they had received from them. Scientologists are Opportunistic Parasites and should be avoided at all cost or you risk losing your children and your money.",

I\u0027m hoping this book can be a lifeline to my former comrades.\r\nDuignan says he began doubting the church, coincidentally, at a Scientology gala that featured Tom Cruise. \r\nAccording to Duignan, he began to see that the church was all about money.\r\nAn Amazon spokespeople claims that Cruise\u0027s visit and their reluctance to sell The Complex is merely co-incidental.\r\nThe book is available in the Irish Republic.",

      "description": "South Park has ridiculed it, protesters have attacked it and Germany has tried to outlaw it. \r\nYet the Church of Scientology still operates in 160 countries, with an extremely complex economic model that makes it hard for opponents to go after its finances. \r\nThis video gives a glimpse into the finances of the secretive church.\r\nEver since the 1980s, when it faced a potentially lethal class-action lawsuit and intense scrutiny from the U.S. government, the group has reportedly spread its revenues\u2014and its liability\u2014among a vast array of independent trusts, corporations and nonprofits. \r\nAll are reportedly tightly controlled by David Miscavige, a second-generation Scientologist, who has run the church since the 1986 death of its founder, science-fiction author L. Ron Hubbard.\r\nTax filings from the early 1990s show that the church was earning about $300 million a year back then, but the paper trail disappears after that. \r\nThe church won tax-exempt status in 1993 and is not required to file annual returns with the I.R.S., so its extremely difficult to tell just how much Scientology takes in during a given year. \r\nHowever, Portfolio.com asked a number of sources - ex-Scientologists familiar with the churchs finances to help arrive at an estimate of its annual revenue.\r\nAccording to a former Scientologist, a single 2007 event in the U.K. helped pay for dozens of new buildings and fueled a two-week pledge drive that netted nearly $50 million. \r\n\r\nThe biggest recent single U.S. gift was reportedly a $7.5 million donation from Nancy Cartwright, who does the voice of Bart Simpson. \r\n\r\nOther major donors include Tom Cruise, whos given an estimated $25 million over the years, Kirstie Alley, and Jenna Elfman.  \r\n\r\nThe estimated revenue from fundraising and donations is $100 million.\r\nScientology boasts hundreds of organizations, centers, and missions around the world, which charge annual membership fees to their members.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, followers also pay to be cleared of their problems via counseling sessions known as auditing, (which average $500 an hour).\r\n\r\nThe estimated revenue from compulsory donations and auditing is $400 million \r\nTherefore, the Bottom Line is that the TOTAL ESTIMATED ANNUAL REVENUE IS $500 MILLION",

      "description": "The body of Gregory B. Wisner, age 27, was found in the surf near Indian Rocks Beach, Florida on January 20, 2001.\r\n\r\nHe was killed by the Scientology Corporations NARCONON Institute.\r\n\r\nGregorys life was a tragedy.  He was DISCONNECTED by his father and the rest of his family when he was only 9 years old and he never recovered from this abandonment.\r\n\r\nHis father was R. Michael Wisner, a prominent Scientologist and chief spokesperson for NARCONON.  He often appeared on TV touting the benefits of NARCONON.  \r\n\r\nIn truth, a two year study by Duke University showed that the NARCONON programme was actually detrimental to recovery.  \r\n\r\nTwo years after NARCONON treatment, 94% of patients had relapsed. Of addicts who attempted to break their addiction alone, 89% had relapsed (a 5% improvement on NARCONON).  \r\n\r\nOf patients who had received traditional psychiatric treatment only 37% of patients had relapsed after two years.  These results provide a clear indication of the inefficacy of NARCONON and the beneficial effects of psychiatry.\r\n\r\nGregory Wisner had started to use cocaine in his teens to cope with his problems and, when he was 27, his parents contacted him and coerced him into joining the controversial NARCONON drug rehabilitation programme.\r\n\r\nThis involved taking lengthy saunas (up to 5 hours at a time) and ingesting huge quantities of vitamins (including Niacin, which is toxic at high doses) and drinking up to three gallons of water a day.\r\n\r\nThe church of scientology refers to this programme as Purification or Purif and it was created by the insane founder of the cult, L Ron Hubbard.  \r\n\r\nThis protocol was the cause of death of German Scientologist, Konrad Aigner (please see my video).\r\n\r\nNARCONON did not help Gregory in the least and, as a result, his family abandoned him once again.\r\n\r\nGregory confided in a friend, I have no one to turn to and that really sucks.  I have never been so stripped of my identity.  Im in the middle of nowhere and with no one to turn to.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards, Gregorys body was found washed up on a beach near Clearwater in Florida.  Postmortem findings found that he had drowned and detected Cocaine (0.70 mg/L) in his blood and urine. \r\n\r\nJohn R. Thogmartin, M.D., Chief Medical Examiner, commented, The cocaine intoxication may have contributed to his drowning but it is not known if his death was accidental or suicide.\r\n\r\nHowever, his state of mind, following DISCONNECTION by his family, and his weakened physical state following the ruthless Purif procedure are the true reasons for the young mans death.  Cocaine was merely the catalyst.\r\n\r\nGregory Wisners father, R. Michael Wisner, is still a prominent Scientologist has his own personal Scientology webpage: http://www.our-home.org/rmichaelwisner/\r\n\r\nIt contains no reference to his son.  He did not even attend his son\u0027s funeral.",

Anonymous too are fighting totalitarianism.\r\nRecently, the supply of V for Vendetta masks has dwindled  despite an enormous demand from members of Anonymous and other fans of the movie.\r\nWhat is the reason for this economic disparity?\r\n\r\nA Nameless Organization - thought by the \u0022Ozzie Dots\u0022 retail outlet in Hollywood to be the Scientology Corporation - has bought an entire shipment of \u0022V masks.\r\n\r\nIf true, what could be the churchs motives?\r\nThere are two possibilities.\r\nThe first is to market them in an attempt to gain the names and addresses of members of Anonymous.\r\n\r\nThe second would be to cut the supply of these masks in an attempt to deter people from joining Anonymous.  Without a V mask, most people would be put off from protesting in fear of Fair Game.",

      "description": "Scientology is one of many Alien cults that arose in the 1950s.\r\nHowever, unlike most Alien cults, who are proud of their extraterrestrial connections (e.g. Heavens Gate or Aetherius Society), Scientology is determined to try and hide their connection with Aliens.\r\nThrough the Internet, however, it is now widely known that at the heart of Scientology is the belief in an Alien Overlord named Xenu, who supposedly visited the earth 77 million years ago and killed billions of Aliens in the volcanoes of Hawaii.\r\nThe ghosts of these dead aliens (known as thetans) remain on earth to this day and parasitize each and every one of us causing all of our mental problems and other diseases.\r\nIn this video, two high-ranking Scientologists (one OT-7, the other OT-8) deny the Xenu story to camera (which is a blatant lie as the Xenu story is forms the basis of OT-3 and they are well aware of this).\r\nThey also deny that L. Ron Hubbard claimed Christ never existed  and deny that Hubbard taught Christ is actually an alien mind control implant (a story which is taught in OT-8).\r\nLater in the video, Tory Christman (a former OT-7 Scientologist and now a critic of the cult), corners and embarrasses another high ranking Scientologist who, as usual, denies the existence of Xenu.\r\nThis scientologist continues to deny the Xenu story despite Tory confirming that she actually saw the original document penned by Hubbard when she worked alongside him as one of his messengers.",

However, as of November 13th 2008, the trial had yet to begin.\r\n\r\nInitially, VIRGINIA STEWART, Spokesperson for the Church of Scientology Australia, denied that the victims were Scientologists.

China and several African nations have been approached, with offers of help with educational policy. Ron Hubbard would have liked to rule the world.

The Police will then turn up, warn the innocent Anonymous protesters, and once the Police have departed, a Scientologist will then sneak up on an unsuspecting activist and punch them in the face and then run away.\r\nOne such occurrence (caught on video) follows:\r\nIn a recent case (on Sunday, October 26th near Golden Era Studio), a young man and a female friend were lured in to bushes by Scientology Security Guards and beaten up.  A Riverside Sheriffs officer arrived and arrested the male victim on \u0022charges of trespassing!\r\nIn another case, in Hollywood, a young man protesting the death of Uwe Stuckenbrock in the RPF was punched in the head while two witnesses filmed his fleeing attacker and awaited the police. \r\nThe victim stated, \u0022There was absolutely no provocation on my part. The guy came from behind me, punched me and ran away.\u0022\r\n\r\nScientologist attorney Kendrick Moxon was on hand and demanded cameras to stop recording or he would be forced to sue. \r\nThe attacker attempted to lie to the LAPD; he had called them and reported \u0022being chased by Anonymous.\u0022  If not for the video tape, there would have been no evidence to collaborate the story.

Or is there possibility for reformation into a genuine religion.\r\nIf it is possible, a minor miracle is needed, as David Miscavige, a man known for his hostility to scientologists, scientology critics and his implacable opposition to change, will need to abandon thirteen of its most heinous and bizarre current policies.\r\nPOLICY 1: FAIR GAME MUST STOP.  Defending your religious beliefs is perfectly legitimate.  However, attempting to UTTERLY DESTROY anyone who criticizes them is totally unacceptable for an organization claiming to be a church.\r\nPOLICY 2: COMPULSORY and EXORBITANT CONTRIBUTIONS must end.

No religion needs a secret service whose responsibility is to specifically detect and destroy its critics.\r\nPOLICY 4: STOP ILLEGALLY PRACTICING QUACK MEDICINE.  You are not doctors, you have no medical qualifications and you do not have the right to deprive a sick person of their medication.\r\nIn many cases, the medication is a prerequisite to survival and, as a consequence, hundreds of people have died on account of Scientologys ridiculous religious beliefs.  \r\nInfamous deaths, to name just a few, are those of Lisa McPherson (Introspection Rundown for Psychosis), Roxanne Friend (Cancer), Heribert Pfaff (Epilepsy) and Noah Lottick (Depression).\r\nPOLICY 5: GIVE MEMBERS FREEDOM OF CHOICE and FREEDOM OF SPEECH.  If a member wishes to leave the church, let them.  If they really believe in Scientology they will return.\r\nPOLICY 6: DISCONNECTION MUST BE ABANDONED.  No one should have to choose between their family and their faith.\r\nPOLICY 7: STOP ALL ILLEGAL CHILD LABOUR.  Children should be allowed to play and receive a proper education. \r\nIn scientology, children are used for cheap/free labour.  Jenna Miscavige has testified that children as young as 6 have had to haul rocks over long distances to construct walls and other structures.\r\nPOLICY 8: FORCED ABORTIONS MUST BE ENDED FOR SEA ORG MEMBERS.  This is not just immoral but it takes away the parents basic human right of choice to have their baby.\r\nPOLICY9: DISBAND THE REHABILITATION PROJECT FORCE (RPF).  \r\nPunishment camps are not compatible with a religious organization.  In the RPF you are worked to total exhaustion, you are deprived of sleep and food and you can be kept in the RPF for years.\r\nChildren are not immune from the RPF and reports of abuse are common.\r\nMany people are kept in the RPF for so long that they die there.  Last week UWE STUCKENBROCK, a 46 year old German with severe Multiple Sclerosis died in the RPF.  He had been imprisoned for over 5 years and had progressively deteriorated.\r\nThe RPF is a death sentence for anyone with a severe illness.\r\nPOLICY 10: Stop selfishly blocking public streets at weekends for parties and carnivals.  It is a major disruption for the residents and motorists.\r\nPOLICY 11: CHURCHES and RELIGIOUS SERVICES should be available for anyone not just members of the club.\r\nPOLICY 12: SCIENTOLOGYS TEXTS SHOULD BE FREELY AVAILABLE TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN JOINING THE FAITH.  Scientology, being an Alien Religion, seems to be embarrassed by its beliefs (especially the OT3 course).\r\nMoreover, at the time of making this video, to cross the BRIDGE TO FREEDOM (comparable to completing the Christian Sacraments) costs $385,000.\r\nPOLICY 13: SCIENTOLOGISTS BELIEVE THEY ARE MORE ADVANCED and EVOLVED than the rest of mankind.  They refer to themselves as HOMONOVIS (as compared to Homosapien).\r\nThey also believe that as they progress across the Bridge to Freedom, they acquire Supernatural Powers.  This ridiculous lie must be abandoned.  Perhaps, it is the concept of Homonovis that attracts so many celebrities to the cult.",

Further lawsuits followed throughout the years, totaling nineteen from all over the world.\r\nThrough the next 15 years, as she continued to expose the Cult, Paulette Cooper was the target not only of litigation but of several harassment campaigns including a Scientology campaign known as OPERATION FREAKOUT, the goal of which was to have Cooper \u0022incarcerated in a mental institution or jail or at least to hit her so hard that she was put under so much stress and anxiety that she was incapable of work.\r\nThe Cult then broke into Coopers home and forged bomb threats using her typewriter and paper with her fingerprints on it.  Cooper was arrested by the FBI and charged.  She faced a jail sentence of 15 years.\r\nFortunately for Cooper, the Church\u0027s campaign was discovered when the FBI raided Scientology offices in 1977 and recovered documents relating to the operation.  The Church finally agreed to an out-of-court settlement with Cooper in 1985 in exchange for her discontinuing her legal actions against Scientology.\r\nThis video is a unique interview with Cooper about her attack by the scientology cult.",

Portions go to his 11 elder children; his widow and young son; and his charitable foundation.\r\nThere was no provision for the Church, which ordinarily requires its celebrity members to pony up when they die.\r\nKelly Preston, who only vaguely knew Hayes through the church, carried on at both Memphis funerals, crying on cue and blubbering to anyone whod listen about how much she \u0022loved\u0022 him.\r\nThis amused to no end the Memphis musicians whod known Hayes for 40 years.\r\nHayess eldest daughter, Jacqueline, is said to be in the forefront of settling Hayes financial matters.\r\nHayess heirs are keeping a keen eye on their fathers copyrights. Many of them were renewed in 1995-96 for a second 28 year term. \r\nThus, when those start expiring in 2024, the family will come into a fortune thanks to the Songwriters Act of 1927.",

      "title": "Anonymous CRUSHES Scientology! Victory for Gregg Housh!",
      "description": "After 7 months of Scientology stalling in the Boston courts, the judge has decided that it is stalemate and has ended the case in Gregg Houshs favour!\r\nScientology wanted to use Gregg Housh as an example of what it could do to its enemies; ruin them financially and destroy them completely for simply being critical of their policies.\r\nWhen the Cult of Scientology placed Housh on trial for harassment in March, spectators, including Attorneys, described the case against him as ridiculous\u0022. \r\nGregg Housh was on trial for 7 months on two charges of criminal harassment and trespassing. BOTH CHARGES HAVE BEEN DROPPED based on non-adequate prosecutor evidence. \r\nThe question is why a church would spend so long - and 10 pre-trial hearings  and so much money  on a case that they were almost certain to lose.\r\nThe DA is quoted as saying, After a review of the evidence, prosecutors determined they could not meet their burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt on this charge of criminal harassment and could not in good faith move forward with it.\r\nHad the case gone to trial, prosecutors would have had to introduce evidence and testimony to show that Housh and others entered the Church of Scientology\u0027s Beacon Street building in a boisterous manner during a March 15 protest, disturbing the proceedings and alarming those inside.\r\nThe cult instigated the trumped-up charges because Mr. Housh was the applicant on the permit for the first Boston Protest. \r\nThis involves a process where an actual person must file a permit with the city council to reserve a protesting spot.  This is a public filing, which is in the public records and which anybody can get a hold of. \r\nScientology\u0027s lawyers used it to identify Gregg Housh as the member of Anonymous who signed the application.  They then turned their full attention to destroying him because he was the only person they had any information to on. \r\nThe Scientology vs Gregg Housh case was a classic example of Scientology\u0027s Fair Game Act, which cult founder, L. Ron Hubbard, defined as the \u0022penalty\u0022 for anyone deemed to be in an \u0022enemy of the church\u0022.\r\nThe Act reads, ENEMY - SP Order.  Fair game.  May be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist.  May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed.\r\nAnonymous, a human rights and fee-speech group, challenged the Cult of Scientology when Scientology tried to pull an embarrassing Tom Cruise Video from the internet. \r\nAnonymous, discovering that the church was a criminal organization guilty of numerous human rights violations - and even murder - decided to declare war on the cult.\r\nThe war has persisted for months now and Scientologists have stalked, assaulted, tried to sue, and even attempted to murder a member of Anonymous. \r\nAttempts by Scientology  mainly by Tommy Davis - stating that Anonymous are the criminals have been dismal and totally dismissed by the public and the FBI.\r\nScientology has a history of being overly litigious. This lawsuit was their form of harassment, where the person getting sued, Mr. Housh, had to spend lots of money to defend himself against a trumped up charge in a court room for months. \r\nHoush has endured 10 pre-trial dates for charges including harassment and disturbing the peace, WHICH HAVE BEEN DROPPED.  Additional charges were added at the expense of the cult. \r\nThe cost of Houshs defence is unknown at this time.  However, since Boston Scientology took too long on a case where there was huge doubt, RESTITUTION CAN BE IN ORDER FOR MR HOUSH.\r\nThis wont really bother the Scientologists who believe:\r\n\u0022The purpose of the suit is to harass and discourage rather than win. The law can be used very easily to harass, and enough harassment on somebody will generally be sufficient to cause professional decease. \r\nIf possible, of course, ruin him utterly.\u0022\u2014L. Ron Hubbard, The Scientologist, a Manual on the Dissemination of Material, 1955 \r\nWBCN, a radio station in Boston, made a 4 day series about Scientology during its most popular radio hours - the Toucher and Rich show. \r\nThe radio show tapes prove in favor of Housh and I will be uploading them in the near future.  Mr. Housh was unavailable for comment at this time.",

      "description": "From Free Tibet to Stop the Iraq War, hordes of protesters milling around Boston is no longer a strange sight for its Harvard students. \r\nHowever, the recent exhibition Psychiatry: Industry of Death stopped students in their tracks and drew protests of its own at its 30 Brattle Street location. \r\n\r\nThe much-discussed exhibition, which closed last week, was organized by the Citizens Commission for Human Rights (CCHR), an immorally named group that is part of the Church of Scientology. \r\nAccording to the groups Web site, the non-profit organization hopes to clean up the field of mental health.\r\n\r\nTo do so, the exhibition uses its own form of shock therapy.  Video screens show graphic footage of lobotomies and electroshock treatment; treatments that the Scientologists seem to conveniently ignore are things of the past.\r\nLobotomies (surgical dissection of the prefrontal cortex) were most popular between 1930 and 1950 (for schizophrenia and intractable depression).  \r\nBy the early 1970s their use had generally ceased and the last time a lobotomy was used was in France in 1986.\r\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT), in which a seizure is induced in an anaesthetized patient (with intractable schizophrenia, psychotic depression, manic depression or catatonia) was, similarly, most popular between 1930 and 1950.  \r\nIt is rarely still in use today and has been shown clinically to be the most effective treatment for severe depression.  \r\nThe American Psychiatric Association and the British National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence have shown that the procedure does NOT cause brain damage in adults.\r\nBack at Harvard, a nearby board displays photos of celebrities, such as Kurt Cobain and Elliot Smith, who, the exhibit claims, had been killed by psychiatry. \r\nOutside on Brattle Street, the groups organizers handed out DVDs featuring the exhibitions footage to passers-by.\r\n\r\nIf CCHR doesnt sound familiar, Anonymous might.  Anonymous, which has previously protested against the Church of Scientology, brought swarms of its members to Brattle Plaza several times during the exhibitions run.\r\nCCHRs exhibition ran for several weeks longer than had been originally planned. But the tactics they employed to draw more visitors to the site were not met with approval. \r\n\r\nThey were persistent to the point of harassment, Kelly, a shop clerk, said. Some were reasonable; others would follow you. Sometimes, they pulled aside women with children. \r\n\r\nZhen Gong, a 10 year old boy, said he was accosted by one of the exhibitions representatives as he was about to eat at a local restaurant. \r\n\r\nI was waiting to meet a friend and his mom when someone came up to me.  He told me about the exhibition, gave me a flyer, and said Dont believe psychiatry! Its an industry of death! ADHD doesnt exist! \r\n\r\nPromotional tactics aside, many students said they thought putting an anti-psychiatry exhibition in the heart of an Ivy League campus was unorthodox. It wasnt what I would expect to see in the square. Kelly said. It was weird. \r\n\r\nMuch of the discussion and controversy stemmed from the claims made by CCHR.  \r\nOne particularly contentious claim in both the exhibit and the DVD was that in the past four decades, nearly twice as many Americans have died in government psychiatric hospitals than in all US wars since 1776. \r\nAnother alleged that psychiatrists are treating people against their will. \r\n\r\nThe DVD also ran through a history of eugenics and stated that psychiatrists were responsible for the Nazi actions during the Holocaust of WW2.  However, few, if any, visitors seemed convinced by this line of thought.\r\nThey also claim that psychiatrists were responsible for the world trade centre terrorism on 9/11.\r\n\r\nUnless you are easily convinced by a crazy amount of very graphic imagery and very shady looking video production, it wouldnt be convincing, Daniel Ashwood said. \r\n\r\nProfessor Anne Harrington of the History of Science department said that she thought CCHRs argument had no credibility. \r\n\r\nThe CCHR accept the words of psychiatrists which support what they want to hear - but they also talk about psychiatrists like a bunch of corrupt crooks, Harrington said. \r\n\r\nIts like holding up a distorted mirror to psychiatry, she added. The distortions get in the way of our ability to see the truth.\r\nMany famous people treated by psychiatrists have subsequently achieved outstanding accomplishments.\r\nFor example, the book and film A Beautiful Mind chronicled the life of John Forbes Nash, a Nobel Prize-winning mathematician and economist who was diagnosed with schizophrenia.\r\nIn addition, it is an ongoing question as to why many creative geniuses had bipolar disorder.   Famous bipolar patients include Ludwig van Beethoven, Sir Isaac Newton, Vincent van Gogh, Kurt Cobain, Charles Dickens and Stephen Fry.",

The medical expert also claims the Top Gun star may have suffered some kind of childhood trauma.\r\nHe writes, \u0022Why would somebody be drawn into a cultish kind of environment like Scientology? To me, that\u0027s a function of a very deep emptiness and suggests serious neglect in childhood, maybe even some abuse, but certainly neglect.\u0022\r\nHowever, Cruise\u0027s attorney, Bert Fields, has slammed the article, insisting Pinsky\u0027s analysis is absurd.\r\nHe tells the New York Post\u0027s gossip column PageSix, \u0022This unqualified television performer, who is obviously just looking for notoriety, is so grotesquely unprofessional as to pretend to diagnose Tom and others without ever meeting them.\r\n\u0022He seems to be spewing the absurdity that all Scientologists are mentally ill. The last time we heard garbage like this was from (Nazi propaganda chief) Joseph Goebbels.\u0022 \r\nWhere two views are diametrically opposed, the truth most often lies in between.  Pinsky is certainly not the first to question Cruises mental stability or his requirement for validation through Scientology.

      "description": "INSANE Scientologists are poisoning their children with a home-brewed baby formula created by L Ron Hubbard.\r\n\r\nA number of the lesser-know beliefs and practices of Scientology have come under public scrutiny lately due to the very public behavior of celebrity Scientologists Tom and Katie Cruise. \r\n\r\nOne such controversy involves the use of a Scientology-approved home-brewed baby formula, which critics claim causes malnutrition and tooth decay.\r\n\r\nL Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, had a number of peculiar views about childbirth, motherhood, and child rearing. His bizarre ideas are accepted unquestioningly be his followers, including notions that cigarettes cure cancer and radiation poisoning, that diseases are attributable to alien ghosts and that BREASTFEEDING AN INFANT IS ACTUALLY HARMFUL TO A CHILD. \r\n\r\nIn the Volunteer Minister\u0027s Handbook, Hubbard writes:\r\n\u0022Breast feeding babies may have a nostalgic background, particularly to a Freudian oriented medico, but real breast milk is usually a poor ration. Modern mothers smoke and sometimes drink. Smoking makes the milk very musty. Anyway, a nervous modern mother just can\u0027t deliver the right ration. Maybe it\u0027s the pace of the times or the breed, but there are few modern Guernsey-type mothers. So even without drinking or smoking, one should forget breast feeding.\u0022\r\nHubbard went on to devise his own baby formula recipe, which he purportedly discovered on a TIME-TRAVELLING VISIT TO ANCIENT ROME. The formula recipe consists of barley water mixed with cow\u0027s milk and corn syrup or honey.\r\nAnyone versed even slightly in infant nutrition will recognize this recipe as a disaster in the making. \r\n\r\nBesides lacking in essential nutrients and fatty acids, both Barley and cow\u0027s milk are difficult for babies to digest and pose allergy risks, while corn syrup is devoid of nutritional value and promotes tooth decay. \r\n\r\nIts recommended substitute, honey, is unthinkable for infants under one year of age due to an elevated risk of botulism poisoning - and Clostridium botulinum and the most poisonous toxin known.\r\nUnfortunately, due to the high regard that Scientologists hold for Hubbard, even advice as ridiculous as this is held almost as gospel, and the barley-water-honey formula is popular with Scientologist parents.\r\nUnfortunately, even with the wealth of information promoting breastfeeding as the best possible infant nutrition, Scientology\u0027s core doctrines promote mistrust of the medical community.\r\n\r\nModern medicine is regarded as primitive and inferior to Scientology\u0027s own practices, which call for Dianetics and auditing for most ills, and a variety of quack remedies penned by Hubbard, including potentially dangerous doses of Niacin for purposes of \u0022purification,\u0022 and smoking as both a curative and a nutritional supplement.\r\n\r\nTo this day, Scientologists with infants are pressured to adopt Hubbard\u0027s child rearing advice, from \u0022silent birth\u0022 to the potentially fatal home brewed baby formula. Even more alarming is the public use of the formula by Celebrity Scientologists such as Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes and Leah Remini.",

      "description": "Bill Maher is on his soapbox - looking like a lunatic - and holding court in London\u0027s Hyde Park.\r\nA crowd forms around the American talk show host - who is disguised in glasses and a funny hat as he preaches that aliens have infected our souls - and only Scientology provides the cure of removing them.\r\n\r\n\u0022Xenu brought aliens here 75 million years ago, stacked them around volcanoes and blew them up with H-bombs. You have to rid yourself of the implants from the extraterrestrial dictators\u0022 he tells his audience.  \r\nScientologists teach that these alien ghosts are responsible for all of our fears, anxieties, depression, mental illnesses and many other diseases (including epilepsy and cancer).\r\nMaher says, imploring folks to use an e-meter, Scientology\u0027s primary tool, to measure their alien ghost (or Thetan) levels and determine the extent of their alien infection.\r\n\r\nThis scene appears in Maher\u0027s new documentary, \u0022Religulous,\u0022 and it prompted roars of laughter from an audience at a screening last month. \r\nThe title of the documentary is a mixture of \u0022religious\u0022 and \u0022ridiculous\u0022 and it takes a shot at all religions.  \r\nHowever, Scientology receives the greatest contempt and Maher\u0027s comedic routine in Hyde Park was eminently successful at taking a shot at the 55-year-old religion - often called a cult -- that\u0027s turned Tom Cruise into such a weirdo.\r\n\r\nComedian, Politician and self-acclaimed aetheist, Maher concludes, \u0022Jesus with the virgin birth and dove and snake who talks in a garden -- that\u0027s cool.  \r\n\u0022But the Scientologists, they\u0027re the crazy ones - and what better way to discredit something than to make belief in it laughable?",

      "description": "On Sunday evening, October 12, a masked Anonymous, peacefully demonstrating on L Ron Hubbard Way in Los Angeles with other members of the group, was punched in the face by a member of the Church of Scientology. \r\nPolice were called and the unidentified Scientologist was handcuffed. Charges are pending.\r\nKendrick Moxon, Scientologys attorney, was present but did not make a statement for the record. \r\n\r\nHere is the report from the Anonymous protester who was assaulted:\r\n \u0022A few minutes after we arrived at Big Blue, a scientologist came out of nowhere and punched the side of my face. It was a loud punch as the mask crackled.\r\nWe have two witnesses and I started filming right after the event as we followed this man, while we called the cops. \r\nAfter the scientologist tried lying, the LAPD cop realized his story did not make sense - and the cop made him admit he hit me without provocation at which point he handcuffed him.\r\nThere was absolutely no provocation on my part. The guy came from behind me, punched me and tried to get away.\r\nMost of the events immediately following the events are on film, taken with better cameras than mine.\u0022\r\nThis is not the first time a peaceful protester has been assaulted by Scientologists in Los Angeles.  \r\nOn July 12, at a fast food restaurant next to LRH Way, a female demonstrator was shoved, grabbed and scratched by former voice over actress Noelle North, a prominent Scientologist and professor at Pasadena Community College. \r\nCharges have been pressed in that case, but no arrest was made at the time of the incident.\r\nIn San Francisco, ex-Scientologist Tommy Gorman was punched by a Scientologist while protesting. \r\nOther assaults have occurred in San Francisco, Battle Creek, MI, Toronto, OT, and elsewhere internationally. \r\n\r\nL. Ron Hubbard Way has become the focus of international attention in the past month. \r\nUwe Stuckenbrock, a former Security Chief of Scientology, reportedly died on October 8 of multiple sclerosis while on Rehabilitation Project Force in a building attached to the Scientology compound on L. Ron Hubbard Way. \r\nRPF is a form of punishment, including reduced rations and hard labor, meted out to the elite Scientology Sea Organization workers for perceived crimes against Scientology.\r\nDespite his medical condition, Stuckenbrock had been assigned to RFP for at least 5 years on L Ron Hubbard Way and had been treated at USC County General on welfare funds.\r\nSea Org members are not provided with health care or health insurance by the Church of Scientology.  They also must sign a contract which is binding through millions of reincarnations, and are paid less than $50 a week. \r\nScientology\u0027s assets -- which include vast properties around the world and a cruise ship, plus cash and copyrights -- are estimated to be worth over a billion dollars. However, due to their shadowy nature, exact figures are difficult to calculate. \r\nNancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson, recently donated $10 million dollars to the Church; other celebrity members who have made million-plus dollar donations include Tom Cruise and John Travolta.\r\nOn September 17, L Ron Hubbard Way received major media coverage and drew international interest.\r\nA resident of L. Ron Hubbard Way and an Anonymous free speech activist spoke before Los Angeles City Council to ask that Scientologys motion to close LRH Way, a public street, every weekend for a year be denied. \r\nThe Church wanted to continue to hold private parties every weekend - something which they had done for the last two years. \r\nThis was the first time residents realized they had legislative recourse and means to end the loud noise, driveway blockages, and harassment they had endured.\r\nA video of the meeting and a television news report were posted online, drawing thousands of views and numerous comments from around the world. \r\nThe Church of Scientology has since withdrawn their request and the street remains open on weekends, much to the dismay of Scientologists and relief of the residents.\r\nFor video updates on this most recent event go to the following link:\r\nhttp://forums.whyweprotest.net/121-raids/anonorange-gets-hit-face-scientologist-lapd-handuffs-him-30066/",

      "description": "BY NOW, most people have learned that France has decided to prosecute scientologys French organization, along with seven of its top managers, on fraud and drugs charges.\r\n\r\nLong before France pressed these latest fraud charges against Scientology, however, church officials were successfully convicted of fraud in Lyon in 1997, and again in Marseille in 1999.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, L Ron Hubbard, the cults founder, was convicted of fraud in that country in 1978 and sentenced to four years in prison. However, he never served his prison sentence despite pleading guilty.\r\n\r\nAfter a seven-year public inquiry and a lengthy trial, the Paris tribunal found four top scientologists, including Hubbard, guilty of making fraudulent claims that physical cures and professional success could be achieved through scientology. \r\n\r\nHubbard, who did not attend the trial, because he had already fled the country, was sentenced to four years imprisonment in his absence.\r\nThe judge concluded that the facts and statements made by the witnesses were ample proof of the veracity of the charge that scientology made false promises with the sole aim of increasing financial revenue. \r\nScientology also declared that psychotherapy and other medical treatments were being dispensed by members with no medical qualifications.  \r\nThey also claimed that Scientology was capable of curing 70 per cent of human illnesses, including radiation burns and poisoning from atomic bomb testing. \r\nHubbard never served his prison sentence because he was essentially on the run from the law, sailing in the Caribbean on his yacht Apollo, trying to avoid not only French authorities but the US authorities as well. \r\nIn 1978, the US federal government was preparing for the trial of Hubbards wife Mary Sue and numerous other scientology officials, on conspiracy and burglary charges. \r\nHubbard, along with scientology lawyer Kendrick Moxon, was named as unindicted co-conspirator in that case. This means the federal prosecutors were sure they were involved, but couldnt quite generate the evidence for a certain conviction. \r\nSue and the others ended up serving several years in federal prison. In addition, the internal revenue service had evidence that Hubbard was creaming hundreds of millions of dollars off the top of scientology profits and hiding it in overseas banks.\r\nHubbard never returned to France and was additionally banned from the United Kingdom because he would not discuss his conviction with British authorities. Hubbard died in 1986 on his secluded California ranch.\r\nPresumably his thetan is discovering the great mysteries of the Universe and having breakfast with God.",

As a result, friends say Tom has waged a desperate battle to change his wifes mind about the religion.  \r\nTom is completely horrified; hes desperate for Katie to stay, but Scientology is everything to him and he cant imagine it not being the guiding influence in their lives.  \r\nIf Tom fails, former high-ranking Scientologist, David Graham, told Womans Day magazine that this could put an irrecoverable strain on their marriage.  \r\nHe states, You are required to disconnect if the handling doesnt work and, in the process of disconnecting, you write to them and tell them that you can have no more to do with them.\r\nKatie joined Scientology shortly after she started dating Tom Cruise and initially claimed to enjoy the gruelling purification processes,  5 hour saunas, intensive and intrusive auditing sessions where she is forced to divulge all of her darkest secrets and sins.\r\nDavid Graham says that its not unusual for members to start questioning the religion as they progress through the hierarchy; Initially, when you first become involved it does seem a bit like therapy.  \r\nHowever, eventually, you realise that all of its promises of a perfect memory, increased intelligence and freedom from lifes stresses and strains are a lie.   \r\nThen, when you reach the OT3 level it starts to become pure science fiction and you realize that the religion is completely crazy. \r\nWill the fate of Katie Holmes follow that of Nicole Kidman, who was stunned to receive divorce papers two weeks after publicly revealing she was, a little bit of Buddhism, a little bit of Scientology  and a big part of me is still a Catholic girl.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\nhttp://brisanon.org/forums/brisanon/breaking-news/womans-day-katie-quits-scientology",

      "title": "The MESSIAH of SCIENTOLOGY - David Miscavige",
      "description": "The music for this video was inspirationally chosen by Anastasia, my friend in Toronto (AnonymousNasty): Youre so vain by Carly Simon.\r\nDavid Miscavige was born on April 30, 1960, in Philadelphia and, following in his fathers footsteps, joined Scientology in 1971. \r\nIn 1976 he left high school and joined the Sea Organization.  In 1977 he worked directly under L Ron Hubbard (the cults founder) as a cameraman for Scientology training films.\r\nFavoured by Hubbard, in early 1981 he was placed in charge of the Watchdog Committee and the All Clear Unit, whose duties were to handle the numerous legal claims that were being filed against Hubbard.\r\nIn 1981, Mary Sue Hubbard (L Rons wife), who, at that time, was second only to L. Ron Hubbard in Scientology\u0027s hierarchy, was appealing her prison sentence for her part in Operation Snow White - and she began to face criticism from within the Scientology organization. \r\nIn 1982, The St. Petersburg Times published an article, \u0022The Man Behind Scientology, in which it stated that \u0022During two heated encounters between Miscavige and Mary Sue Hubbard he persuaded her to resign her position as second in command.\r\nTogether they composed a letter to Scientologists confirming her decision -- all of this without even consulting L. Ron Hubbard.\r\nThis is the point where David Miscavige ENVISIONED himself as the successor to L Ron Hubbard as the Head of Scientology.\r\nHowever, in 1986, when L Ron Hubbard knew that he was dying, he circulated an order to the Sea Org that his best friends, PAT and ANNIE BROEKER, were to take over as leaders of the church. \r\nMiscavige was furious and, the following year, when he became Chairman of the Board of the Religious Technology Center, his first act was to criminally seize control of the cult for himself.\r\nHe did this by forcing the BROEKER\u0027S out by threatening to expose them to the IRS for failure to pay taxes; a crime which would have seen them spend the rest of their lives in prison.\r\nIn 1993, after lengthy negotiations, and a threat of 1,400 Legal Actions against the IRS, David Miscavige made an agreement with the IRS that formally acknowledged the organization as a church.   \r\nMany people, including Senators and High Court Judges, regard this freedom from paying taxes as illegal and millions of Americans (and millions world-wide) cant understand why the criminal 1993 decision hasnt been over-turned.  \r\nOne can only assume that the Blackmail used by David Miscavige in the potential 1,400 acts of litigation must have been extremely threatening and embarrassing to the IRS personnel at the time.\r\nIn 2008 members of the internet community Anonymous declared the start of a campaign to get the Tax Exempt Status of the Church of Scientology revoked. \r\nThis modern day Dictator shares the same goal of World Domination as his more illustrious Nazi counterpart. \r\nSimilarly, he uses Propaganda and Lies to fool thousands of naive and unsuspecting parishioners and uses the title \u0022church\u0022 as a \u0022religious cloak\u0022.\r\nIn addition, in common with the Nazi\u0027s, Scientology is revolted by the mentally ill and sees homosexuality as a physical and mental illness.\r\nThe church openly states that the Mentally Ill and Gays and Lesbians should be Quarantined and Institutionalized.\r\nTORY CHRISTMAN, a former OT-VII level Scientologist, confirms these facts in an interesting video discussing the death of L Ron Hubbard:\r\nURL http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=eKGDBASr2Vk). \r\nIn January 2008, when questioned about the allegation that Tom Cruise was second in command of the Church, Elliot Abelson, general counsel for the Church of Scientology stated: \u0022The only person who runs the Church and makes policy decisions is David Miscavige. \r\nDavids older brother, Ronnie Miscavige, also joined the church of Scientology in the early 1980s and was also in the Sea Org.  However, he famously left the Organization in 2000. \r\nSimilarly, his daughter, Jenna Miscavige Hill, another former Sea Org member, defected from Scientology in 2005.",

      "description": "Date of TV Broadcast: OCTOBER 01 2008\r\nSwedish taxpayers have been indirectly supporting the Church of Scientology though local government contracts given to front organizations with ties to the group.\r\nAccording to a Sveriges Television (SVT) documentary, 156 of Swedens 290 local councils have contributed more than 10 million kronor ($1.4 million) to the Scientology movement.\r\n\r\nMuch of the money has been channeled through contracts with Narconon, a company which offers a controversial (and ineffective) treatment method for drug addicts.\r\n\r\nAccording to SVT, Narconon also serves as a front organization for the Church of Scientology and contributes 10 percent of its earnings to the main branch of the movement.\r\n\r\nI dont actually think that politics can dictate what they do with their profits, said Cecilia Lund, a Social Democratic council member from Esl\u00F6v in southern Sweden, to SVT.\r\n\r\nEsl\u00F6v has paid Narconon more than 1.5 million kronor for its services in the last five years\r\n\r\nThe SVT report also details other organizations with ties to the Church of Scientology that has received contracts with various municipalities in Sweden.\r\n\r\nOne such organization is the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR), which attempts to discredit all forms of psychiatry and claims that psychiatry is to blame for the Holocaust and the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in America.\r\n\r\nSVT has interviewed people who have abandoned Scientology who explain that the movement relies on front organizations to raise money and recruit members.\r\n\r\nIf they give money to Scientology front-organizations, then the Scientologists will increase their control in Sweden in a very disingenuous way, said Los Angeles native and 24-year Scientology veteran Michael Pattinson to SVT.\r\n\r\nScientology is a body of beliefs and practices created by American author L. Ron Hubbard in the 1950s. Former members accuse the group of being a cult which brainwashes its members in an attempt to acquire their money and their assets.",

Kyles father, being a Scientologist, and being apposed Psychological medicine, pilfered Kyles medication and hid it overnight in his truck.\r\n\r\nWhen Tom Brennan returned home that evening, Kyle was unconscious due to a deficiency of his medicine.\r\nFinding his son unconscious, Tom Brennan called the Church of Scientology and, after a long discussion, they decided to send Jerry Gentile to Toms Apartment.\r\nJerry Gentile arrived 45 minutes later.\r\nJerry Gentile is married to Denise Miscavige (the sister of DAVID MISCAVIGE, the Head of the Church of Scientology).\r\nDavid Miscavige took the decision to call 911 and request an ambulance for Kyle.\r\nThis telephone call was made roughly 90 minutes Kyle Brennan was found unconscious.\r\nKyle Brennan, like Lisa McPherson before him, was delayed medical treatment and was declared Dead on Arrival at hospital.\r\nThe Clearwater Police found Kyles medication hidden in Tom Brennans truck the next day.\r\n\r\nKyle\u0027s father was more concerned with protecting the interests of the Church of Scientology that he was of saving his son\u0027s life. \r\nHe was also guilty of negligent homicide by depriving his son of his medication.  Litigation in this case is imminent.\r\n\r\nIf you want to protest about Kyles murder by Tom Brennan, Jerry Gentile, David Miscavige and the Church of Scientology, \r\n\r\nIf you are outraged by the circumstances of Kyle\u0027s death, please express your disgust to the following authorities:\r\n\r\nAttorney Luke Lirot,\r\n2240 Belleair Road, Suite 190,\r\nClearwater,\r\nFlorida 33764.\r\nhttp://www.lukelirot.com/\r\n\r\nSteven E.
