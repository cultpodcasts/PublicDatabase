      "description": "Faith and Adam are joined by Steven Hassan. In this episode, we discover the secrets of cults, the impact of AI, and the future of humanity. Steven, a cult expert and author, shares his personal experience within the Moonies cult, highlighting their manipulation and thought-stopping techniques.\n\nWe\u2019ll explore the psychology of cults, the \u0022malignant narcissism\u0022 in powerful figures, and the unsettling parallels between Donald Trump and cult leaders. We also look into AI\u0027s role in paranoia and social media\u0027s addictive allure with apps like TikTok and its potential for mind control by the Chinese government. \n\nWe\u2019re excited for you to hear this episode, we talk about so many different aspects of mind influence and coercion, and even futurist ideas like Elon Musk\u0027s Neuralink, and the controversial notion of trans-humanism.\n\nSubscribe to the Jolty Podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/jolty\n\nFOLLOW FAITH POPCORN\n\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@faithpopcorn\\\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@faithpopcorn\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/FaithPopcorn\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/faithpopcorn/\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/faithpopcorn/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/faithpopcornfuturist/",
