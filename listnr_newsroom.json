      "description": "Headlines:\u00A0Caravan with explosives found in Sydney allegedly intended for antisemitic attack, lowered inflation rates open the door to April election date and Sweden charges man in first ever drink driving case involving a drone.\n \n\nDeep Dive: Elizabeth Struhs was an eight-year-old girl, living with incurable Type 1 diabetes in regional Queensland. Instead of receiving the insulin she needed to live, her parents and other members of their fringe religious group, The Saints, withdrew her injections, believing the healing power of God would save her. She died of diabetic ketoacidosis in January 2022.\n \n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, in a bombshell Supreme Court ruling, 14 members of the congregation, including her parents, were found guilty of manslaughter. They included Elizabeth\u0027s father and the leader of the congregation, who had originally been charged with murder.\n \n\nIn this episode of The Briefing, Bension Siebert is joined by investigative journalist Richard Baker on the ground in Queensland to explain who The Saints are, why what happened to Elizabeth is manslaughter, and whether this case will have any impact on other fringe religious groups that reject modern medicine around the country.\u00A0\n \n\nFollow The Briefing:\u00A0\nTikTok: @listnrnewsroom \nInstagram: @listnrnewsroom\u00A0@thebriefingpodcast \nYouTube:\u00A0@LiSTNRnewsroom \nFacebook: @LiSTNR Newsroom\n\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener (https://omnystudio.com/listener)  for privacy information.",

      "description": "Cult leader Jim Jones ordered his followers in the jungle of South America\u2019s Guyana to drink punch-laced cyanide under the promise that they would be granted access to paradise. The compound in which Jones lived, preached and ultimately murdered hundreds of people has been reclaimed by the jungle and closed off since the late 70s. But a local travel agency has just started tours to the site, promising to honour the victims and their memories.\n But is it insensitive for tourists to visit a location with such a dark and tragic past? Or is it no different to the tourism we see at Auschwitz, the 9/11 site or Chernobyl? In this episode of The Briefing, Chris Spyrou speaks with tour organiser from Wanderlust Adventures, Roselyn Sewcharran.\u00A0\n Follow The Briefing:\u00A0TikTok: @listnrnewsroom Instagram: @listnrnewsroom\u00A0@thebriefingpodcast YouTube:\u00A0@LiSTNRnewsroom Facebook: @LiSTNR Newsroom\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",
