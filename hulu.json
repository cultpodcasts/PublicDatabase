      "description": "When popular vlogger Ruby Franke was arrested for child abuse in August 2023, it quickly became one of the biggest trending stories in America. For years, the Frankes\u2019 YouTube channel had documented a wholesome, happy family life, with 2.5 million subscribers tuning in at its peak.\n\nBut happy families are rarely what they seem. As the cracks began to show, the family turned to counselor Jodi Hildebrandt for guidance \u2013 and rapidly found themselves trapped in a nightmare. Only the Frankes know what went on inside their home.\n\nDevil in the Family: The Fall of Ruby Franke streams February 27 on Hulu and with Hulu on Disney Plus.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HULU\u2019S YOUTUBE CHANNEL\nClick the link to subscribe to our channel for the latest shows \u0026 updates: http://www.youtube.com/hulu?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSTART YOUR FREE TRIAL \nhttp://hulu.com/start \n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hulu/ \nHulu on Twitter: https://twitter.com/hulu\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hulu\n\nABOUT HULU\nHulu is the leading all-in-one premium streaming service that offers an expansive slate of live and on-demand entertainment, both in and outside the home.
