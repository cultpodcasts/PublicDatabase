      "description": "When it comes to cults\u2013from MLM to MAGA\u2013the question everyone wants answered is: how do I get my loved one out? In this episode, Dr. Mara Einstein tackles that question with Dr. Tanya Johnson, a therapist specializing in religious trauma, cult recovery, and high-control groups. She explains the cult recovery process while providing insights from her experience growing up Mormon.\n\n\nIn this episode, you\u2019ll hear:\n\n  \u2022  Dr. Johnson\u2019s personal background growing up in the Mormon church in Salt Lake City and what \u201Cnormal\u201D looks like when the belief system is the culture.\n  \u2022  How doubt begins: the strain of \u201Cmental gymnastics,\u201D and what it feels like to allow the thought \u201Cwhat if it isn\u2019t true?\u201D\n  \u2022  The \u201Cshelf break\u201D metaphor\u2014the point where accumulated contradictions collapse, and belief can\u2019t be forced back into place.\n  \u2022  Belief isn\u2019t purely a choice\u2014and why high-control systems can be especially brittle when core truth-claims fail.\n  \u2022  The more a group demands obedience to an external authority over your own judgment, the more \u201Chigh-control\u201D it is.\n  \u2022  The aftermath: grief, anger, disorientation, community loss\u2014and why leaving can feel like a death and a divorce at the same time.\n\nHow cults and high-control groups work (and how to recognize them):\n\n  \u2022  Dr. Johnson references frameworks like Steven Hassan\u2019s BITE Model, but also offers her own practical lens: \u201Clocation of authority\u201D, who has the final say in your life\u2014you, or an external authority you\u2019re expected to obey?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to help someone who\u2019s still inside:\n\n  \u2022  Why arguing facts often fails (closed-loop logic, thought-stopping clich\u00E9s, fear, exhaustion).\n  \u2022  What works better: staying connected, asking calm questions, and keeping the relationship intact so there\u2019s somewhere safe to land when the shelf finally breaks.\n  \u2022  Why vulnerability\u2014not intelligence\u2014is the real risk factor. There is no category of \u201Cpeople who could never fall for this.\u201D\n\nFor therapists and clinicians:\n\n  \u2022  This work requires specific training, because clients from high-control environments may instinctively transfer authority to the therapist, making it essential to keep handing power back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the guest\n\n\nDr. Tanya Johnson is a licensed mental health counselor, clinical supervisor, and professor with specializations in religious trauma and cult recovery, neurodivergence, and cross-cultural communication. As a Cuban-American, queer, neurodivergent ex-Mormon, Dr. Tanya blends personal insight and over 15 years of clinical experience to her work. She supports clients through her private practice, Evolve Counseling Center, mentors early-career therapists in her membership community, Colorful Minds Collective, and teaches counseling students as an adjunct professor at Antioch University. Based in Miami, Florida, Dr. Tanya is licensed in both Florida and Washington State. She holds a BS in Psychology from the University of Utah, an MA in Counseling from Liberty University, and a PhD in Counseling with a specialization in Marital and Family Therapy from Barry University.\n\n\nCounseling: www.evolvecounselingcenter.com (http://www.evolvecounselingcenter.com) \u00A0\n\n\nColorful Minds Collective: www.colorfulmindscollective.com (http://www.colorfulmindscollective.com) \u00A0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the host\n\n\nDr. Mara Einstein spent a decade in corporate marketing working for some of the world\u2019s biggest brands before turning her focus to exposing the industry\u2019s inner workings.

      "description": "Digital technologies have been fundamental to the proliferation and perpetuation of cults of all kinds. Joining Dr. Mara Einstein for an examination of belief, power, and persuasion are two very special guests: one a theologian and the other an internet scholar. Together they make the case that we are not just living with technology\u2014we are living inside its belief systems. And without conscious resistance, reform, and real-world community, those systems will continue to define reality for us.\u00A0\n\n\nIn Part 1, Dr. Mara speaks with Greg Epstein, humanist chaplain at Harvard and author of Tech Agnostic. From founders as prophets to platforms as congregations, tech didn\u2019t just borrow religious metaphors\u2014it replaced religion for many people, without the safeguards, humility, or reform movements that traditional religions developed over time. But if tech behaves like a religion, does it also behave like a cult? Together, Dr. Mara and Greg unpack charismatic leaders, apocalyptic thinking around AI, the myth of \u201Cdoing good,\u201D and why some of the most powerful people in tech may sincerely believe they\u2019re saving the world\u2014while making democracy, equality, and community harder to sustain.\n\n\nIn Part 2, Dr. Mara is joined by Jamie Cohen, a media scholar who studies digital culture, from surveillance capitalism to online radicalization. Algorithms, advertising infrastructure, data extraction, and prediction systems don\u2019t just sell products\u2014they sort people into belief systems. Micro-targeted ads, grievance-based online movements, incel and extremist ecosystems, and how algorithms reward identity silos, free labor, and radicalization all connect directly to cult dynamics: closed information loops, in-group language, moral certainty, and the increasing difficulty of exit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMentioned in this episode:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n  \u2022  Tech Agnostic \u2014 Greg Epstein\n  \u2022  Good Without God \u2014 Greg Epstein\n  \u2022  Hoodwinked \u2014 Dr. Mara Einstein\n  \u2022  Life 3.0 \u2014 Max Tegmark\n  \u2022  The Drama of the Gifted Child \u2014 Alice Miller\n  \u2022  \n     \n\nAbout the guest \u2014 Greg Epstein\n\n\nGreg M. Epstein serves as Humanist Chaplain at Harvard \u0026 MIT, where he advises students, faculty, and staff members on ethical and existential concerns from a humanist perspective. He was TechCrunch\u0027s first \u201Cethicist in residence\u201D and has been called \u201Ca symbol of the transition in how Americans relate to organized religion\u201D (The Conversation). He is the author of the New York Times-bestselling book Good Without God and has also written for MIT Technology Review, CNN.com, The Boston Globe, The Washington Post, and Newsweek. His most recent book is Tech Agnostic: How Technology Became the World\u0027s Most Powerful Religion, and Why It Desperately Needs a Reformation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the guest \u2014 Jamie Cohen\n\n\nJamie Cohen is an associate professor of Media Studies at CUNY Queens College. He is also a Salzburg Academy on Media and Global Change faculty fellow. Jamie is a digital culture expert, and his work focuses on internet literacies, memes, and visual media. His current project is Angry Boys Among Us: How the Manosphere Became Culture, and What We Can Do About It, an exploration of the manufactured manosphere created by an interconnected network of online men\u2019s influencers and entertainers who subsist and profit by exploiting vulnerable young men\u2019s fears and anxieties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the host\n\n\nDr. Mara Einstein spent a decade in corporate marketing working for some of the world\u2019s biggest brands before turning her focus to exposing the industry\u2019s inner workings.

What begins as \u201Cjust shampoo\u201D turns into unpaid labor, psychological manipulation, and moral injury\u2014mirroring the dynamics of high-control groups and cults.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether, Dr. Mara and Julie unpack why MLMs disproportionately target women, why governments continue to legitimize these structures, and how shame keeps people trapped. But, in a twist the industry didn\u2019t see coming, social media has steadily begun to crack the system open. Julie also explains how she transformed the very marketing skills she learned inside MLMs into a powerful force for exposing them\u2014online and offline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull shownotes and transcript: https://www.drmaraeinstein.com/podcast/commercial-mlm-cults\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this episode:\n\n  \u2022  Why Julie calls MLMs \u201Cendless chain recruitment fraud,\u201D not businesses\n  \u2022  How incentive periods, bonuses, and rank structures hook people early\n  \u2022  Why over 99% of participants must lose money for MLMs to function\n  \u2022  The personal-development trap\u2014and how coercion is disguised as motivation\n  \u2022  How MLM coaching programs replicate cult dynamics\n  \u2022  The psychological toll of realizing you\u2019ve harmed people you recruited\n  \u2022  The long exit: overcoming shame, cognitive dissonance, moral injury, and the slow lift of the \u201Cveil\u201D\n  \u2022  How TikTok and social media accelerated the collapse of MLM narratives\n  \u2022  Practical advice for people who feel ready to get out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMentioned in this episode:\n\n\nDocumentaries \u0026 Media\n\n  \u2022  LuLaRich \u2013 Amazon Prime\n  \u2022  The Vow \u2013 HBO (NXIVM)\n\nOrganizations \u0026 Institutions\n\n  \u2022  Federal Trade Commission (FTC)\n  \u2022  Direct Selling Association (DSA)\n  \u2022  Direct Selling Education Foundation (DSEF)\n  \u2022  Competition Bureau of Canada\n\nBooks \u0026 Podcasts\n\n  \u2022  Hoodwinked: How Marketers Use the Same Tactics as Cults \u2013 Dr. Mara Einstein\n  \u2022  Merchants of Deception \u2013 Eric Scheibeler\n  \u2022  Life After MLM \u2013 Roberta Blevins\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the guest\n\n\nJulie Anderson was simultaneously in a multi-level marketing company and an MLM-adjacent coaching cult for five years.

      "description": "In this episode, Dr. Mara Einstein sits down with Chris Kneeland, co-founder of Cult Collective and The Gathering, and anthropologist Ali Demos of StrawberryFrog, to unpack the surprising overlap between cult psychology, brand loyalty, and modern movement-making.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether, they explore why brands like Apple, LEGO, Costco, REI, Harley-Davidson, YETI, and even gas stations inspire devotion that looks a lot less like shopping and a lot more like belonging. They also break down how movements like Opt Outside or Money Like a Woman emerge from cultural undercurrents\u2014and why some brands earn genuine trust while others fall into the trap of purpose-washing \u2013 claiming a cause they aren\u2019t committed to \u2013 ultimately leading to boycotts and consumer distrust.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis conversation pulls back the curtain on the mechanics of brand cults: rites and rituals, villains and fights, co-creation, identity shaping, the erosion of traditional institutions, and the human desire to affiliate with something bigger than ourselves. It\u2019s a candid look at how these forces shape consumer behavior\u2014and why personal meaning-making has become fully embedded in the consumer marketplace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this episode:\n\n  \u2022  Why \u201Ccult brand\u201D doesn\u2019t always mean niche\u2014and how Barbie, the NFL, LEGO, and Porsche ended up in The Gathering\u2019s Brand Hall of Fame\n  \u2022  The difference between a brand cult (top-down, ritual-driven) and a brand movement (bottom-up, co-created, culturally activated)\n  \u2022  How brands use rites, rituals, insider language, and \u201Cpicking a fight\u201D to build irrational loyalty\n  \u2022  Why some brands (Lush, Patagonia, CVS) take real risks that prove purpose isn\u2019t just a tagline\n  \u2022  The anthropology of cult / culture / cultivate, and why brands have become identity engines as religion and long-term employment decline\n  \u2022  Why Costco shouldn\u2019t work on paper\u2014and why it\u2019s one of the strongest cult brands in America\n  \u2022  Why even gas stations or utilities can build cult-like devotion\u00A0\n\n\n\n\n\nMentioned in this episode:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBooks \u0026 Frameworks\n\n  \u2022  The Power of Cult Branding \u2013 Matthew W.

What used to live on remote compounds now lives in your feed, your shopping cart, and the brands you identify with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Mara breaks down how vulnerable people get targeted, love-bombed, upsold, and turned into unpaid evangelists\u2014and why she believes we\u2019re not in an attention economy anymore, but an anxiety economy. Most importantly, she shows you how to start spotting the pattern to reclaim your self-agency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this episode:\n\n  \u2022  How the word \u201Ccult\u201D went from derogatory description to being widely applied to religion, brands, and politics\n  \u2022  Why brands now sell identity (\u201CI am Mac\u201D) instead of products\n  \u2022  How cult recruitment steps parallel the marketing funnel, from targeting vulnerable prospects to conversion to loyalty\n  \u2022  How stealth ads, influencers, and algorithms blur the line between content and commerce\n  \u2022  Dr. Mara explains the \u201Ccult marketing continuum\u201D\u2014a theoretical framework for understanding the scope of cult tactics in marketing and politics\n  \u2022  Why most people eventually get out, and what that means for reclaiming your agency\n\n\n\n\n\nMentioned in this episode:\n\n  \u2022  Hoodwinked: How Marketers Use the Same Tactics as Cults \u2013 Dr. Mara Einstein\n  \u2022  The Wrong Way Home \u2013 Arthur Dyckman\n  \u2022  The Power of Cult Branding \u2013 Matthew W.
