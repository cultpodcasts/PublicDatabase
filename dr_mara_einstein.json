      "description": "Women who hope to start a small business are being encouraged to use micro loans.\n\nMicroloans have been used in so-called Third World countries to help women start businesses and help build up their communities.\n\nThe bank behind us was Grameen Bank. The US version of that bank is called Grameen America.\n\nThe chairperson and CEO is Andrea Jung. She used to have a similar position at Avon.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s coincidental that these loans are being promoted to join MLMs.\n\n#MLM #Anti-MLM #Marketing #Deceptive #microloans",
