      "description": "In this solo episode, Dr. Mara Einstein follows the trail from Jonestown to Apple, to TikTok influencers, and MLMs, uncovering how cult psychology has quietly become a blueprint for modern marketing. What used to live on remote compounds now lives in your feed, your shopping cart, and the brands you identify with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Mara breaks down how vulnerable people get targeted, love-bombed, upsold, and turned into unpaid evangelists\u2014and why she believes we\u2019re not in an attention economy anymore, but an anxiety economy. Most importantly, she shows you how to start spotting the pattern to reclaim your self-agency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this episode:\n\n  \u2022  How the word \u201Ccult\u201D went from derogatory description to being widely applied to religion, brands, and politics\n  \u2022  Why brands now sell identity (\u201CI am Mac\u201D) instead of products\n  \u2022  How cult recruitment steps parallel the marketing funnel, from targeting vulnerable prospects to conversion to loyalty\n  \u2022  How stealth ads, influencers, and algorithms blur the line between content and commerce\n  \u2022  Dr. Mara explains the \u201Ccult marketing continuum\u201D\u2014a theoretical framework for understanding the scope of cult tactics in marketing and politics\n  \u2022  Why most people eventually get out, and what that means for reclaiming your agency\n\n\n\n\n\nMentioned in this episode:\n\n  \u2022  Hoodwinked: How Marketers Use the Same Tactics as Cults \u2013 Dr. Mara Einstein\n  \u2022  The Wrong Way Home \u2013 Arthur Dyckman\n  \u2022  The Power of Cult Branding \u2013 Matthew W.
