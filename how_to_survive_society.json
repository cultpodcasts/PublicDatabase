      "title": "How To Survive Society with Isabella Young",
      "description": "Isabella Young (B.Ed., M.Ed. Pre.) studied and taught Physical Education, Outdoor Education, Health, and Exercise Physiology to undergraduate and postgraduate students in Victoria, Australia. She was a pioneer in the establishment, development, and research of therapeutic Outdoor Education programs in Australia, and a founder of Out Doors Inc. (www.outdoorsinc.org.au), a non-profit organization that has provided outdoor adventure and recreation programs for people with poor mental health since 1987. In 1994, while completing a Ph.D. and lecturing in Outdoor Education, personal tragedy struck. At 33, widowed, pregnant, and with a three-year-old son, Isabella began her own healing journey that has spanned three decades. She has crisscrossed three continents under three different names, undertaking pilgrimages, retreats, shamanic journeys, and vision quests; living in the wilderness and in ashrams, including eight years in a messianic cult as the wife of the \u201Cguru,\u201D who took the life of her son to prevent being exposed as a pedophile, a rapist, a thief, and a con man. Her son\u2019s murder broke her free from cult brainwashing, and she escaped to Hawaii. Through her relentless devotion to heal, free her mind, and discover the Truth, Isabella is now free from suffering and enjoying life immersed in the natural beauty of Kauai, writing, swimming, growing food, and going barefoot. Isabella is the author of Putting on the Armor of God: A survival handbook for the Great Awakening and the Future of Humanity, which is essential reading to understand that humanity and the organic evolution of our species is under attack and that we need to be connected to our Divine nature, Nature, and each other to ensure our health, well-being, the freedom and future of humanity.
