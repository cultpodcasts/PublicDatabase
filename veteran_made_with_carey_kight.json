      "description": "In episode 157, I sit down with Daril Fannin \u2014 Army veteran, award-winning screenwriter, producer, and the founder of KINO \u2014 for a raw, energetic conversation about his path from military life to Hollywood and the power of authentic human interaction.\n\nWe dive deep into Daril\u2019s upbringing in a fundamentalist Pentecostal cult, his eye-opening introduction to the world of movies, and how storytelling literally changed the course of his life. Daril\u2019s journey from combat medic to making deals with A-list celebrities in the entertainment industry demonstrates exactly what\u2019s possible when we choose to connect with others on a human level to build genuine relationships.\n\nWe don\u2019t sugarcoat the grind or the realities of transitioning from the military to an industry as ruthless as entertainment. Authenticity isn\u2019t just a buzzword, it\u2019s a real way of being and a real strategy for building a fulfilling, sustainable career. Cinema is more than escape; it\u2019s communal, foundational, and instructive. It shapes the very way we see the world. Through Daril\u2019s story, we break down the myth that success in Hollywood is about who you know or luck \u2014 it\u2019s about being deliberate with your relationships, relentless in your pursuit, and refusing to settle for transactional exchanges when you can build meaningful human connection instead.\n\nEpisode Sponsors:\nhttps://store.veteranmadeproductions.com/\nhttps://www.gopills.com/ -- use \u0022VM15\u0022 at checkout for 15% off your order.\nhttps://www.bubsnaturals.com/ -- use \u0022veteranmade\u0022 at checkout for 20% off your order.\nhttps://www.truemadefoods.com/ -- use \u0022VET\u0022 at checkout for 15% off your order.\nhttps://www.rucksox.com/ -- use \u0022VETERANMADE15\u0022 at checkout for 15% off your order.\nhttps://bravoactual.com/ -- use \u0022Veteran Made\u0022 at checkout for 15% off your order.\n\nIntro Song composed and produced by @cleod9music489 \n\nSOCIALS:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/veteranmade.ck/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/darilfannin/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/kinomakesmovies/\nhttp://x.com/veteranmade.ck\nhttps://x.com/kinomakesmovies",
