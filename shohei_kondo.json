      "description": "Today, I want to share my thoughts on the Japanese left-wing political party Reiwa Shinsengumi and its leader, who feels to me like a \u201Cdancing Bernie Sanders,\u201D but with his own unique background and approach. Recently, he\u2019s faced heavy criticism, and some people even call his supporters a cult. But are they really a cult? And if so, how? While editing this video, I realized why I wanted to make it. I\u2019ve been following him since 2011\u2014not as a supporter, but as someone who sees him as a person who genuinely wants to change Japan.\n\nIf you find this interesting, let me know your thoughts in the comments. Do you think Japan can change through movements like this?\n\n#reiwashinsengumi  #JapanesePolitics #Japan #Explainer",
