      "description": "Celine raises the question whether there is a link between religious belief and long life. Following the Netflix series Live to 100: Secrets of the Blue Zones the question of whether religious belief increases wellbeing is discussed by Stephen and Celine. Is there good data to suggest there is a link? If there is, is it a causal relationship or can it be explained through other factors. Is \u0022belief\u0022 itself the key or is it what the belief might make you do? Also should we care about the \u0022truth claims\u0022 that religions often make?

Maryann, Regina, Vincent, Tanya, Riley from the Jexit Channel and Scott from Witness Underground, discuss their own experiences of building a social world following isolation after leaving. They discuss their mistakes and lessons learned, and how they\u0027ve come through the process.

      "description": "This short bonus episode is the audio version of a blog Stephen recently published on Medium. Many leavers of high control religions use \u0027waking up\u0027 as a metaphor for realising the group we had been a member of had been telling us lies, and that we had a warped worldview. The film \u0027The Matrix\u0027 holds resonance for many of us. In this short piece Stephen explores this, and another movie about dreaming and waking up - Inception. Upon leaving, knowing how to relate to the world is difficult and a learned suspicion of authority can sometimes lead us into fringe belief systems and Stephen reflects upon his own journey and what he learned.

      "description": "It\u0027s perhaps the most famous psychological study ever but what does it really tell us? And what might it tell us about cults? In the 1970s Professor Philip Zimbardo created a simulated prison in the basement of a college building, separating volunteer students into the roles of prisoners and guards to observe their behaviour. What happened next is disturbing, and led to a view that when it comes to behaviour, more important than the individual\u0027s ethics and morality, it\u0027s the situation that really matters. In addition to the obvious ethical issues raised by the study there have fairly recently been challenges to its claims and the scientific methodology. Stephen and Celine go deep into what it really tells us and it\u0027s not what was claimed.

What is the story behind characters such as David Grusch and Louis Elizondo? At a deeper level, how do existing beliefs play into how we interpret evidence? Stephen also shares with Celine some surprising reporting about just what certain officials, at and around, the Pentagon believe and how close they are to this story.

Is there already a cult algorithm that coercive groups have been using for years? And what happens as AI gets smarter at deploying these online? How does YouTube\u0027s recommender algorithms brainwash people according to some computer scientists? Often described as a cult, online phenomena QAnon has spread largely thanks to algorithms, so Stephen and Celine find out where it came from and its effect. Finally the question: AI - what\u0027s the Bible\u0027s view? is a question no-one\u0027s been asking apart from JW.Org so Cult Hackers find out what they have to say on the matter.

      "description": "One of the most emotional interviews ever on our podcast, author Kimberley L Miller talks movingly about her life as Jehovah\u0027s Witness. She describes growing up as a Witness and the struggle to just be a child, to just be herself, and the fear that came along with that upbringing. She also talks about her leaving the organization, her return and the lowest point in her life. Kimberley\u0027s story is ultimately life affirming and inspirational. It was such a privilege to talk to her. Warning: This episode briefly discusses the suicide attempt Kimberley talks about in her book.

John is a successful artist and he talked about his journey out of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses back in September of 2021.\u00A0 Our main topic of conversation today is the natural world and we had an interesting chat about all things evolution, creation, our place in the Universe and other minor considerations. John also showed me the rewilding project he is working on as part of a local community project. If you want to see the area we walked, Sarah and I recorded a little video of the area as we took a stroll with our little dog Pepper.

It got me thinking about an episode Celine and I recorded about a year ago when we had very few listeners about the subject of life and death. I listened to it again and realised how much I had enjoyed the conversation and how much Celine\u0027s words had taught me. So we\u0027ve released it again.

The term \u0027New Religious Movements\u0027 is seen as a more appropriate and less prejudicial label than the word cult, should we be using it? Are anti-cult activists getting in the way of proper sociological research? Is brainwashing not really a thing?

      "description": "Erika Bornman, author of Mission of Malice talks to us about her life growing up in Kwasizabantu, a non-denominational Christian Group she describes as a cult. As a child and a young woman she endured physical and mental abuse, was groomed by her church \u0027counsellor\u0027 and witnessed horrendous abuses. In her early twenties she managed to escape but at great personal cost. Erika\u0027s story is emotional, touching and at times harrowing but at the heart of her story is a message of hope and of finding a way to make sense of life outside the confines of a controlling and damaging ideology.

When you leave there\u0027s a desire and a possible need for self development, but there\u0027s also a risk of getting sucked into another all-encompassing system of belief. We discuss this question and more in the latest episode.\u00A0 Plus we have \u0027Tweet of the Week\u0027 where we look at biases and how much High Control Groups use these to influence their followers and potential victims.

Alex was raised as a Jehovah\u0027s Witness and was an elder before leaving, going through a very difficult period until he discovered his real calling. Warning: During our discussion there is mention of suicidal thoughts. Alex talks frankly, and with plenty of humour about his life as a Jehovah\u0027s Witness child, growing up and then the crisis that led him out of the organisation. He is now a respected artist and shares his philosophy on life. This was such a privilege and a rare opportunity to talk to such a singular talent. We hope you enjoy is as much as we did.",
