This week some of the Cult Hacker Patreon supporters join Celine and Stephen on a panel of former Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, to explore the process of finding and making friendships outside a high-control group. Maryann, Regina, Vincent, Tanya, Riley from the Jexit Channel and Scott from Witness Underground, discuss their own experiences of building a social world following isolation after leaving. They discuss their mistakes and lessons learned, and how they\u0027ve come through the process. Christmas can also be a tricky time around friendships so the panel talk about their preferred way of either embracing it or escaping it.

      "description": "This short bonus episode is the audio version of a blog Stephen recently published on Medium. Many leavers of high control religions use \u0027waking up\u0027 as a metaphor for realising the group we had been a member of had been telling us lies, and that we had a warped worldview. The film \u0027The Matrix\u0027 holds resonance for many of us. In this short piece Stephen explores this, and another movie about dreaming and waking up - Inception. Upon leaving, knowing how to relate to the world is difficult and a learned suspicion of authority can sometimes lead us into fringe belief systems and Stephen reflects upon his own journey and what he learned.

As teenagers they believed Jesus return would happen in 1981 and that they would be saved if they stayed within the group that was following Jesus properly.

In the 1970s Professor Philip Zimbardo created a simulated prison in the basement of a college building, separating volunteer students into the roles of prisoners and guards to observe their behaviour. What happened next is disturbing, and led to a view that when it comes to behaviour, more important than the individual\u0027s ethics and morality, it\u0027s the situation that really matters. In addition to the obvious ethical issues raised by the study there have fairly recently been challenges to its claims and the scientific methodology. Stephen and Celine go deep into what it really tells us and it\u0027s not what was claimed.

Stephen provides insights into life in the group thanks to his many conversations with former members. It\u0027s some of the worst exploitation we\u0027ve heard about on this podcast with children being forced to work long hours from the age of six, very little freedom within a highly patriarchal and oppressive system. Stephen also provides some more general advice on how to use the law to hold high-control groups and cults accountable for their bad behaviour.\u00A0 Share this podcast with a friend https://pod.link/1540824671 To reach out to us: https://www.culthackers.com/ To become a patron: https://www.patreon.com/culthackers/posts Witness Underground Kickstarter https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/witnessunderground/431102735?ref=akkj92\u0026token=3e50ed5a",

A recent announcement at the JW AGM has informed the rank and file members that they will no longer be asked to report on their ministry.

Professor Touresh also speaks about his experience as a young man in a far left group he identifies as cultic, The Militant Tendency.

      "title": "Is there a UFO cult inside the Pentagon?",
      "description": "Today Stephen and Celine look at the news about claims of UFOs and UAP at the Congressional Hearing on July 26th 2023. This podcast has asked before, what would religious fundamentalists make of the existence of extra terrestrial life? What do we actually know about this story? What was said during the hearing? What is the story behind characters such as David Grusch and Louis Elizondo? At a deeper level, how do existing beliefs play into how we interpret evidence? Stephen also shares with Celine some surprising reporting about just what certain officials, at and around, the Pentagon believe and how close they are to this story. A slightly different feel to this week\u0027s topic episode but we hope you like it.

Is there already a cult algorithm that coercive groups have been using for years? And what happens as AI gets smarter at deploying these online? How does YouTube\u0027s recommender algorithms brainwash people according to some computer scientists? Often described as a cult, online phenomena QAnon has spread largely thanks to algorithms, so Stephen and Celine find out where it came from and its effect. Finally the question: AI - what\u0027s the Bible\u0027s view? is a question no-one\u0027s been asking apart from JW.Org so Cult Hackers find out what they have to say on the matter.

But what about the benefits of playing games and their role in finding community, experiencing a sense of competence and potential benefits around memory and thinking? Germ joins Celine and Stephen this week to talk all things gaming and games.

We chatted and she suggested that the way we think about death changes after we leave a belief system such as the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, who preach the possibility of living forever. It got me thinking about an episode Celine and I recorded about a year ago when we had very few listeners about the subject of life and death. I listened to it again and realised how much I had enjoyed the conversation and how much Celine\u0027s words had taught me. So we\u0027ve released it again. It\u0027s anything but morbid and I really hope you enjoy it too.\u00A0",

      "description": "Today We take a very deep dive into Festinger, Riecken \u0026 Schacter\u0027s seminal work \u0022When Prophecy Fails\u0022. This episode is packed with crazy stuff; exploration of the 1800\u0027s Millerite movement (to later inspire Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses and others), automatic writing, UFO cults, dianetics practitioners, flood prophecies, flying saucers, Atlantis with a bit of \u0027The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu\u0027 thrown in for good measure. Not to mention Venusian footprint interpretation. The idea of cognitive dissonance and its affect on followers facing disconfirmation of the end of the world has become well known, but the research has some real problems as well as some moments of comedy gold.\u00A0 To help follow the characters in the story you can download a table here\u00A0(or from copy and paste the link below).\u00A0 https://3e3480ad-2b0d-4112-8174-0fdd614840ec.filesusr.com/ugd/4c85e9_f1e86bb90c5f40b6a627de8751849978.pdf \u00A0",
