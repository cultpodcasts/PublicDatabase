We\u0027ll explore how El, the supreme deity, was eventually assimilated by Yahweh through centuries of religious blending.

In the Hebrew Bible, this assembly is frequently mentioned in Psalms and prophetic literature. Psalm 82, for instance, describes God standing in the divine council and judging among the gods, highlighting a scene where God holds other divine beings accountable. This portrayal suggests a structured divine realm where celestial beings have roles and responsibilities, often reflecting the governance structures seen in human societies.\n\nHeavenly Beings\n\nHeavenly beings are another integral part of the divine realm, encompassing a wide range of entities including angels, seraphim, cherubim, and other celestial figures. These beings are often depicted as messengers and servants of God, executing divine will and interacting with humanity. In texts like the Book of Daniel, heavenly beings such as Gabriel and Michael play crucial roles, delivering messages and offering protection. Their depiction varies from awe-inspiring and fearsome to comforting and protective, reflecting their multifaceted roles within the divine hierarchy.\n\nThe Divine Counsel\n\nThe Divine Counsel, often synonymous with the Divine Assembly, refers to a group of divine beings who advise and assist God in governing the world. This concept is seen in ancient Near Eastern texts beyond the Hebrew Bible, suggesting a widespread belief in a council of deities or spirits who participate in decision-making processes. In the Hebrew Bible, the Divine Counsel is depicted in scenes like 1 Kings 22, where a council in heaven decides the fate of King Ahab. This passage reflects a courtroom setting where divine beings deliberate and influence earthly events, showcasing a divine bureaucracy that mirrors human political systems.\n\nAssembly of Holy Ones\n\nThe Assembly of Holy Ones, mentioned in texts like Psalm 89, emphasizes the holiness and sanctity of these divine beings. This assembly is depicted as a gathering of celestial beings who praise and worship God, highlighting their purity and devotion. The term \u0022holy ones\u0022 underscores their separation from the mundane and their dedication to divine service. This assembly functions both as a chorus of worshipers and as a council participating in divine governance, reinforcing the idea of a structured and hierarchical divine realm.\n\n\n\r\n#MostHighGod #Elohim #Yahweh #Gnosis #SonsOfGod #BeneElohim \r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

      "description": "Two passionate Bible enthusiasts who both happen to be former #JehovahsWitnesses embark on a journey to explore the doctrine of Bible inerrancy. In this first episode, we\u0027ll delve into the idea of whether the Bible is truly infallible. We\u0027ll present examples, share our thoughts, and engage in lively discussions with each other and our audience. Whether you\u0027re a believer, a skeptic, or simply curious, we invite you to question, learn, and explore alongside us as we navigate this contemptuous topic!\n\nScripture of popular discussion today was 1 Sam and 1 Chron, with the census of David being either incited by Yahweh or Satan. We also hashed out some contrasts between Gen 1 and Gen 2 with two distinct creation stories. \r\n\r\nHosts of Echoes of the Past Podcast:\n@AGoddess \u0026 @ExJwMJ \n\nFor more information on the contradictions in the bible mentioned on today\u0027s show \r\n\uD83D\uDCDA Robin Faith Walsh - The Origins Of Early Christian Literature\r\n\uD83D\uDCDA Bart D.

They strongly believe that the lack of transparency in their former faith\u0027s handling of abuse is a serious issue that needs to be addressed. \r\n\r\nThrough candid conversations,  we\u0027ll explore the role of powerful organizations like the Catholic Church in keeping these secrets hidden and why it\u0027s important for justice and protecting the innocent.\r\n\r\nPlease bring your thoughts on the matter to the chat and discuss with us \u2764\uFE0Fl",

Additionally, the sentencing of \u0022That \u002770s Show\u0022 actor Danny Masterson to 30 years to life for rape has prompted his wife, Bijou Phillips, to file for divorce. Another shocking case unfolds in Utah, where Ruby Franke, a former parenting advice YouTuber, faces charges of child abuse after two of her children were found abused and malnourished.

      "description": "In today\u0027s interview, we have the pleasure of speaking with Micah Allen Losh, an accomplished author who has already published two books with a third one on the way. Micah\u0027s unique background as a former member of the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses organization gives him a unique perspective on life and religion.\n\nDuring our conversation, Micah shares his experiences of growing up as a member of the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses organization. He talks about how his family\u0027s beliefs and the organization\u0027s strict rules influenced his life choices. Micah also discusses the challenges he faced when he decided to leave the organization and the impact it had on his personal and professional life.\n\nOne of the most poignant moments of the interview is when Micah talks about the difficulties he faced when his parents abandoned him after he made the difficult decision to leave the organization. Micah\u0027s story highlights the struggles that many ex-Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses face when trying to rebuild their lives outside of the organization.\n\nOverall, this interview is a must-see for anyone interested in learning more about the experiences of ex-Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses and the impact that religious organizations can have on people\u0027s lives.\n\nHosted by: \nJonathan Wilson (Exwitnessawake) @exwitnessawake \n\nThumbnail by: Connor Marshman \n\nPlease support our guest by visiting his website at: \n\nhttps://www.micahallenlosh.com @malcontent1982 \n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nExwitnessawake (Jonathan) can be found on YouTube @ https://m.youtube.com/@exwitnessawake\n\u0026 on TikTok @ https://www.tiktok.com/@exwitnessawake?_t=8YDMACpdBrB\u0026_r=1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nJoin the Apostate Coalition Discord server, where like-minded apostates can associate and pitch ideas for activism. \nYou can find a link in my link tree. \n\n\n\nMusic: Overcome by Notomus feat.
