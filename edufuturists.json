Petra is a renowned mental health expert, TedX speaker, author, and CEO of mental health consultancy PVL. Her passion for creating psychologically safe spaces can be traced back to her unique background, having been raised in a notorious cult and struggling to find her place in the world. A series of life altering events led her to pursue a career as a psychotherapist so that she could help others. After working in various companies with toxic work environments, she has made it her life\u2019s mission to reinvent the world of work and completely shift the current system, ushering in the future of work.
