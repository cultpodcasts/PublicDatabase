      "description": "Imagine a village in the heart of Uganda, where whispers of prophecy and visions of the apocalypse spread like wildfire. In the late 1980s, a group led by Credonia Mwerinde and Joseph Kibwetere would emerge, claiming to have divine knowledge that the end of the world was near. Followers flocked to them, abandoning their lives, homes, and even families, believing salvation lay in strict obedience to the Ten Commandments. But as the year 2000 approached, things took a dark and tragic turn. Today, we\u2019re uncovering the unsettling story of the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God\u2014a tale of faith, manipulation, and a deadly promise of paradise that ended in unimaginable horror.\n\nDISCLAIMER: THIS VIDEO IS NOT MEANT TO OFFEND OR DISRESPECT ANYONE!

My name is Bongi and i post true crime videos on this channel on Wednesdays at around 3pm/5pm CAT. \nI\u0027ve been interested in true crime for as long as i can remember, and that\u0027s kinda what prompted me to study law. however, soon after enrolling into law school, i realised that i really didn\u0027t like what i was doing and so, as odd as it may be, i started watching a lot of true crime youtubers, and that\u0027s when i discovered youtubers like Bailey Sarian, Eleanor Neale and Kendall Rae. I used to think that all there was to true crime was long documentaries that sound monotonous and are boring to watch, but maan, these three ladies changed my perspective. i do wanna give all the credit to the three of them as they each inspired me to start my own true crime YouTube, and i\u0027ve never been happier. my style is similar to Eleanor\u0027s, with a hint of Kendall.
