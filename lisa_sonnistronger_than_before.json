      "description": "When a relationship feels like oxygen at first and a chokehold later, you\u2019re not \u201Cbeing dramatic\u201D\u2014you\u2019re being indoctrinated. Narcissistic abuse doesn\u2019t look like a one-off bad boyfriend; it mirrors a cult: love-bombing as recruitment, rules that keep shifting, punishment for noncompliance, and a leader who claims to be the only source of truth and love. If you\u2019ve ever wondered why smart, capable people stay, this is why. Lisa sits down with licensed therapist and author Vanessa M. Reiser, LCSW, to map the cult mechanics of narcissistic relationships: idealize\u2013devalue\u2013discard, the Pavlovian reward/punishment loop that forges a trauma bond, and the \u201Cdouble bind\u201D that ensures you\u2019re wrong whether you comply or resist. They dismantle myths (\u201CI\u2019d never fall for that,\u201D \u201Cyou could have left anytime\u201D) and name what\u2019s really happening\u2014coercive control that erodes free will, isolates you from your reality checks, and keeps you chasing crumbs after a manufactured high. Vanessa shares clear, clinician-backed ways to reclaim yourself: depersonalize the abuse (\u201Cit wasn\u2019t about your worth\u201D), rebuild nervous-system safety, and replace the fantasy with facts. \n\nYou are not weak for being targeted; predators select, condition, and confuse. Clarity is the exit ramp. With language for what happened and community that reflects your reality back to you, you can break the bond and rebuild a self that\u2019s yours again.  \n\nResources mentioned:\n\u2022 Vanessa M.
