      "description": "In December of the year 2000, an unknown male broke into a suburban Tokyo home and killed\u00A0an entire family.\u00A0Despite leaving thousands of pieces of evidence in the house, including his clothes, the murder weapon, his DNA, his blood, even his excrement\u2014we are no closer to knowing this man\u2019s identity. There\u2019s no clear motive. And no sign of the case being closed. The Miyazawa family murders are a paradox. They\u2019re a case which has haunted Tokyo police for 22 years now. A case which should\u00A0be solved. But one which has far more\u00A0questions than answers.See Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
