Candice\u0027s self-care journey helped her break free from the indoctrination and she shares her story to help others do the same. ------------------- To contact Candice: Instagram @candi_cee_",

      "description": "To contact Dr. Ryan: www.drryanlee.com\n\n\n\u0022I was raised as a Jehovah\u0027s Witness from birth until the age of 18, when I realized that there was more to the world than I had been taught. The following years, while exciting in some respects, were also challenging as I set out to rebuild my identity, world view and community from the ground up. \n\nI found my own time in therapy to be immensely helpful in this endeavor, however therapists I worked with had little familiarity with the depth to which this kind of religious conditioning penetrates the mind and soul. I often wished for someone who not only understood, but was equipped to help rewrite that unique brand of programming.\n\nAfter earning my doctorate in clinical psychology and accumulating over ten years\u0027 experience as a therapist, I am so happy to be able to make good use of my religious background in the service of supporting others who have made the courageous decision to listen to their heart and seek independence. \n\nI feel so blessed to have found an occupation that I feel so passionately about. My enthusiasm is based both in a love for the work itself and the joy of seeing the positive, life changing results this process has on those who engage with it.\n\nI am currently living in/working from Peru with my two whippets (who hold a very special place in my heart), and have an active interest in plant medicine (primarily ayahuasca), meditation, reading and creating stained glass\nart.\n\n#exjwsthink #jehovahswitnesses #psychology #cults #therapy #narcissism #exjw \n\n\nTo contact Ryan: www.drryanlee.com",

      "description": "Wesley David has lived 2 very different lives, and the only thing that\u2019s held them - and himself - together has been an obsession with music.  \n\nGrowing up in the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, the Singer-Songwriter has relied on a love of all things Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll since a young age as an escape - one which would eventually lead him to become a touring musician in LA, Arizona and the Southwest.  \n\nInfluenced at a young age by the alt-rock and pop of the 90s/2000s like Oasis , Nirvana and Radiohead, plus classic and prog rock from the Beatles to Rush, his whimsical, tongue-in-cheek songwriting style was both identity and escape from the often dreary and frightening world of an expectation of the Apocalypse (delayed).  \n\nHis new EP \u0027Satori\u0027 is a 6-song collection produced by Thom Flowers (Steve Perry, The Ataris, Toad the Wet Sprocket) and features \u0027Easy for You\u0027 \u0027Seesaw\u0027, and \u0027I\u0027ll be damned\u0027.  \n\nWebsite - https://wesleydavidmusic.com\n\nNew EP \u0027Satori\u0027 Signed Cassette - https://wesleydavid.bandcamp.com\n\nSpotify - https://open.spotify.com/album/0dOLLFslUryvWSwipjbksB?si=1QXqmrb3SoC62qnxIjJ1iw\n\nApple Music - https://music.apple.com/us/artist/wesley-david/1526621390\n\n\u0027Easy for You\u0027 Music Video - https://youtu.be/N81koVD1f6E\n\n@wesleydavidmusic\nhttps://instagram.com/wesleydavidmusic",

They created Oh The Crib! records in a house in the forest at teenagers, where he recorded his album for A.D.D. Chronicles, a band inside the cult. \n\nHe ran camera and sound for a local news station and then went university for photography and digital media. Today he runs Banana Island Films, which was born in Hanoi, Vietnam during his five years there, and their music documentary, Hanoi Mixtape, is streaming now at HanoiMixtape.com. Witness Underground is his sophomore film and a much bigger project which includes the Witness Underground Podcast and a series, \u0022XJW Coming Out of the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses.\u0022\n\n The proceeds from their Patreon go towards fostering new healing art through an ex-cult-member artist grant program. You can stream Witness Underground now at Patreon.com/WitnessUnderground.\n\nABOUT JAMES:\n\nJames Zimmerman was a third-generation Jehovah\u0027s Witness. During his time in the religion, he was a Regular Pioneer, Ministerial Servant, and Bethelite. After researching the organization\u0027s teachings, particularly its teaching of Noah\u0027s Flood, he began questioning the Watchtower\u0027s assertion of being \u0022the Truth\u0022. In the interest of raising their son honestly and authentically, James and his then-wife left the religion together. A lifelong Minnesota resident, James currently lives in St. Paul. James is also a licensed minister who has performed several weddings in the Twin Cities area.\n\nAdditionally, here is a link to acquiring his book via Amazon: \nhttps://www.amazon.com/Deliverance-Hand-Redemption-Jehovahs-Witness/dp/0988493802#customerReviews\n\nand here it is at Barnes and Noble: https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/deliverance-at-hand-james-zimmerman/1117024696.\n\n#exjw #jehovahswitnesses #witnessunderground #jworg #nucleargopher",

      "description": "\u0022What I got from drugs was the same thing I got from the organization.\u0022\n\nIt took Joakim a lifetime to understand to what extent growing up in the org controlled parts of his life, how he related to emotions, himself and others, how black and white in his choices, opinions and thinking he was. How it affected his #relationships.\n\n\nHow he for 23 years convinced himself that Addiction is just fun, he couldn\u0027t understand why people did not want to take drugs, a bit like a witness might think that people who have access to the truth and don\u0027t live by it are stupid. Though he was a little bit smarter a little better than others.\nLived in the periphery of society which leads to always feeling left out, unwelcome, less than, or excluded. Without understanding that he felt flawed and like someone who didn\u0027t deserve to belong.\n\n\nHe went from s*icidal into #rehab and discovered Bessel Van Der Kolk and Peter Levine\u0027s view on trauma and childhood adaptations and how it manifests in the body and nervous system. And Gabor Mates modality Compassionate Inquiry a somatic-based psychotherapeutic approach. Through this, Joakim began to heal and change the conditioning or actually, the trauma responses that arose and remained from the org and family dynamics to recognize and change the unconscious #beliefs that were residing in the nervous system.\n\n\nNow Joakim has trained in Compassionate Inquiry and works individually and in groups on zoom with #exjws co-creating a safe, compassionate, and accepting relational space to heal the disconnection that initially occurred in relation to parents, family, #god, and the org. He lives free and happy in Stockholm, Sweden with his 10-year-old twins.\n\n\nCONTACT Joakim:\nInstagram: @joakim_le_bolloch_appell\nTikTok\nWebsite: www.co-compassion.com \n\n\n#exjw #jworg #jehovahwitness #addiction #mindfulness #healing",
