In this video I describe the cult-like behaviour that is spread about miraculous healing beds that are supposedly the product of alien technology, secret military intelligence, or channelled information from angelic beings. Dodgy science and subtle acts of coercion blend together in a fascinating web of disinformation which ultimately results in controlling massive amounts of people around the globe.

      "description": "Patriarchy is a powerful tool for control, and cults know it. In this video, we break down how patriarchal structures are weaponised in cults to suppress, manipulate, and control women-using the infamous Gloriavale community as a case study.\n\nGloriavale, a reclusive Christian fundamentalist sect in New Zealand, enforces extreme gender roles that strip women of autonomy, limit their access to education and employment, and bind them to a life of servitude under male authority. But this isn\u0027t just about one group-it\u0027s a pattern seen in high-control religious movements worldwide.\n\nWe\u0027ll explore how cult leaders use patriarchal ideology to justify coercion, obedience, and silence. How do these groups convince women that submission is divine? Why do some stay despite the harm? And what happens when they break free? Drawing on survivor testimonies, expert analysis, and psychological insights, this video exposes the mechanisms of coercive control hidden behind \u0022traditional values.\u0022\n\nIf you\u0027re interested in dismantling patriarchal oppression, understanding cult tactics, or supporting survivors, this is a must-watch.

From international giants like Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, Scientology, and Twelve Tribes, to homegrown groups like The Family, Divine Truth, and Universal Medicine, these organisations thrive in the shadows, exploiting their members and leaving lasting harm.\n\n\uD83D\uDCA1 I\u0027m Renee \u2013 a teacher and mental health practitioner passionate about raising awareness of coercive control and cult dynamics. After losing my daughter to a destructive cult, I\u0027ve made it my mission to shed light on these hidden dangers.\n\n\uD83D\uDD0E In this video, I\u0027ll break down: \n- The key features of coercive control in high-demand groups.\n- An overview of 30\u002B cults operating in Australia, including some shocking stories.\n- How coercive tactics manipulate vulnerable individuals.\n- The fine line between harmless groups and harmful, controlling organisations.\n\n\uD83D\uDEA8 Why this matters: Cults don\u0027t discriminate \u2013 they thrive on ignorance and exploit trust. With over 3,000 groups estimated to operate across Australia, it\u0027s time we open our eyes to the reality of religious abuse and coercive control.\n\n\uD83D\uDCD6 Learn more: Visit my website at recoverfromcoercivecontrol.com for resources, support, and my detailed rubric for evaluating harmful groups.\n\n\uD83D\uDE4C If you\u0027ve had an experience with a group or have concerns, share your story in the comments or email me at coercionrecovery@gmail.com.

Drawing on real-life examples like the Peoples Temple, NXIVM, Providence (JMS), Shincheonji Church (SCJ), and my personal dealings with Jesus Christians, I explain how cult leaders use sophisticated psychological tactics\u2014not obvious red flags\u2014to manipulate anyone, regardless of intelligence or background.\n\nCults prey on human vulnerabilities like the need for connection, purpose, and belonging. Through love-bombing, isolation, and fear, they bypass critical thinking and exploit even the most rational individuals.

      "description": "Eugenics is a pseudoscience that proposed some individuals are superior to others based upon an inaccurate understanding of genetics and human variation. Historically, it has been used to discriminate and cause harm to those labelled as \u0022inferior\u0022. Similarly, spiritual eugenics proposes that some individuals are superior based upon subjective and bias indicators of spirituality. In this video, I examine the negative impact of these ideologies. \n\nPlease note: Pride and appreciation of one\u0027s physical or spiritual attributes is not the same as discriminating against others who have different attributes. \n\nADDITIONAL CLARIFICATIONS: \nSpiritual eugenics is an active, exclusionary pursuit of spiritual \u0022purity\u0022 that is intolerant of alternative perspectives. It differs from pride or conviction of belief which is a passive and internalised sense of esteem in one\u0027s chosen spiritual or ideological framework that does not cause harm.\n\nPhysical eugenics involves the belief in enhancing or preserving specific physical traits deemed \u0022superior,\u0022 often leading to discrimination or harm against those who don\u0027t fit the ideal, while spiritual eugenics applies similar exclusionary principles to beliefs or practices, treating certain spiritual paths as inherently superior. Just as pride in one\u2019s physical features is valid but doesn\u2019t justify harming or devaluing others with different traits, pride in one\u2019s spiritual beliefs should not translate into diminishing or excluding others with differing views. Both forms of eugenics misuse pride as a justification for exclusion or harm.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n01:07 What is Eugenics?

So how does it happen?\n\nIn this video, we break down the subtle but powerful psychological manipulation techniques cult leaders use to trap their followers. From offering unconditional love and certainty to gradually isolating individuals from their support systems, cults create a system where self-blame replaces critical thinking.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn how cults exploit vulnerability, why self-blame keeps people trapped, and most importantly, how awareness can prevent the cycle of coercion from ever starting.\n\n\uD83D\uDD11 Key topics covered:\n\nWhy good people are targeted by cults\nHow self-blame becomes a powerful tool of control\nThe gradual steps of psychological manipulation\nHow to support someone trapped in a coercive system\nUnderstanding these dynamics is essential\u2014not just for those who\u2019ve been affected but for anyone who wants to recognise and prevent the damage caused by high-control groups.\n\n\u2728 Knowledge is protection.

While Jung offered profound insights into the human psyche, his conclusions often fell short of fully piercing the veil of ancient wisdom. Peterson, as Jung\u0027s modern disciple, takes these ideas and runs with them\u2014sometimes into intellectual dead ends. Join me as I decode their theories, highlight where they went wrong, and reveal a clearer perspective on the symbolic threads connecting ancient cultures.\n\n#CarlJung #JordanPeterson #JungianPsychology #Archetypes #CollectiveUnconscious #Mythology #Symbolism #PsychologyExplained #Philosophy #MythologicalSymbols #IntellectualAnalysis #DebunkingMyths #PsychologicalTheory #FreudVsJung #CriticalThinking #CultofJung\n\nCREDITS: \nMusic by Greeble\nInstagram: @Greeble_\n\nJordan Peterson Tells An Old Story About Gods: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpqXNgvfa4k\n\nThe Religious Confabulations of Jordan Peterson vs Sam Harris: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucJE6AGyvL4\n\nJung Quotes from: The Concept of the Collective Unconscious\nhttp://www.bahaistudies.net/asma/The-Concept-of-the-Collective-Unconscious.pdf\n\nREFERENCE: \nGod is a Wandjina\nhttps://www.abc.net.au/religion/watch/compass/wandjina-is-god/13403554\n\nIMAGES: \nPylon of the Temple of Luxor with the remaining Luxor Obelisk in front\nBy Olaf Tausch - Own work, CC BY 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=86572669\n\nFlaminio Obelisk\u00A0of\u00A0Ramesses II\u00A0from\u00A0Heliopolis\u00A0stands in the centre of the\u00A0Piazza del Popolo,\u00A0Rome.By Jean-Christophe BENOIST - Own work, CC BY 2.5, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=2554019\n\nJordan Peterson\u00A0speaking at an event in Dallas, Texas.\nBy Gage Skidmore, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=70081384\n\nRoman Egyptian coin of\u00A0Antoninus Pius\u00A0(dated year 8 of his reign or 145 AD) showing his portrait and a Zodiac wheel with the busts of\u00A0Helios\u00A0and\u00A0Selene\u00A0in the center\nBy Classical Numismatic Group, Inc. http://www.cngcoins.com, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=148537526\n\nOttoman-style sundial with folded gnomon and compass.

      "description": "In this video, I share the story of my academic and professional journey, spanning over 25 years in teaching and mental health.\n\nI began with a Bachelor of Education (Secondary, Visual Arts) at the University of Melbourne, which led to a fulfilling teaching career, including time in Steiner Education. Later, I completed a Master\u2019s in Mental Health (Arts Therapy) at the University of Queensland and a Graduate Diploma of Psychology (equivalent to a Bachelor of Psychology) at the University of Melbourne. I\u2019ve also worked as a Community Mental Health Practitioner for over five years. My collective experiences bring a blend of expertise in education, psychology, and mental health to conversations I present on this channel.\n\nThe primary focus of this channel is raising awareness about coercive control in high-demand groups\u2014commonly referred to as cults. My commitment to this cause is deeply personal: I lost my daughter to one of the most destructive cults operating today, the Kidney Cult (Jesus Christians), led by David McKay. This group exemplifies how coercion and manipulation can shatter families and lives. My hope is to spare others from the pain and abuse I\u2019ve endured.\n\nIn 2023, I successfully sued McKay for defamation in Victorian Civil Court after he falsely accused me of \u201Cworshipping the devil.\u201D The evidence presented in court demonstrated his accusations were malicious lies. From the Judge:  \u0022At best, the defendant [McKay] had engaged in\nsupposition and guess work. He did not hold an honest opinion that Ms Spencer worshipped the Devil, but rather seized an opportunity to present a range of allegations about the parents of members using sensationalist language.\u0022\n\n This case highlights how such leaders use falsehoods and fear to control narratives and maintain their influence.\n\nOne of McKay\u2019s attempts to undermine me was to misrepresent my association with Steiner Education, falsely equating it with \u0022Luciferian veneration.\u0022 While this claim was rejected in court, it underscored a broader issue: misinformation about Steiner philosophy and my professional background. Addressing these misconceptions is important not just for setting the record straight, but also for supporting my mission to raise awareness of coercive control and its far-reaching consequences.\n\nThis video is my way of clarifying my background, beliefs, and motivations. I welcome thoughtful, respectful dialogue and encourage questions or challenges to my views. Together, we can shed light on coercive control and empower those affected by it.\n\nThank you for your support and for taking the time to listen to my story.\n\n#rudolfsteiner #steinereducation #waldorfeducation #psychology #cultawareness #coerciveorganizations #cultsinAustralia #coercivecontrol #cultmanipulation #cultcoercion #mentalhealth #HighDemandGroups #DefamationCase #RaisingAwareness #CriticalThinking \n\nCREDITS: \nMusic by Greeble\nInstagram: @Greeble_\n\nFootage of David McKay: 7NEWS Spotlight \u0022The dark reality of the Kidney Cult\u0022 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_D64VS-Owc\n\nImage of Steiner: Public Domain\nHallway: My own photos\nLucifer, Ahriman, \u0026 Christ: AI",

But Freud wasn\u2019t the only one borrowing from the Greeks\u2014Christian theology, too, was shaped by philosophers like Aristotle. I explore how Aristotle\u2019s flawed model of procreation influenced the Christian story of the Virgin Mary and examine how myths and legends, from ancient Greece to Christianity, were based on misunderstandings of human reproduction and brain functions. Coercive behaviours are identifiable in both contexts, so I end with a critique of Freud\u0027s cult following.\n\nApologies for any mispronunciations in the video, I have dyslexic tendencies.  \n\n#Freud #AncientGreekPhilosophy #Aristotle #ChristianTheology #VirginMary #Mythology #Psychoanalysis #Philosophy #Psychology #MisunderstoodMyths #IdEgoSuperego #RationalSoul #IrrationalSoul #ReligiousOrigins #HistoricalMisunderstandings\n\nMusic by Greeble\nInstagram: @Greeble_\n\nIMAGES:\nGold ring with Sitting goddess and row of Minoan Genius figures bearing offerings https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=31762241\n\nBronze genius depicted as pater familias (1st century AD)\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=7946831\n\nBritish Museum centaur  https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=5648794\n\nExtent of the empire of Alexander the Great\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=656066\n\nAristotle teaching Alexander the Great \nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Alexander_and_Aristotle.jpg#/media/File:Alexander_and_Aristotle.jpg\n\nUniversity of Vienna\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=56301\n\nEmepedolces\nhttps://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Fragments_of_Empedocles\n\nThe Ego and the Id\nhttps://www.sas.upenn.edu/~cavitch/pdf-library/Freud_SE_Ego_Id_complete.pdf\n\nPlatonic solids\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=77742585\n\nPortrait of Franz Brentano\nhttp://www.aschaffenburg.de/upl_img/c/ch/247/BrentanoFranzFotoMWacker.jpg, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=48572749\n\nOther: Public Domain / AI generated",

You might be surprised who\u2019s really behind these seemingly innocent interactions.\n\nCults don\u2019t reveal their true nature upfront; instead, they use deceptive tactics to lure people in. In this video, we expose the methods used by certain Christian-based cults, like the Unification Church, Shincheonji, JMS, and the Jesus Christians, who often disguise themselves as charity workers or community organizations. From \u2018harmless\u2019 Bible study invites to concealed identities, these groups operate under layers of secrecy. Learn how they draw people in, exploit them for labor, and maintain control\u2014all while keeping the truth hidden. Stay informed, stay aware, and protect your freedom.\n\n#deception #cultdepection #cultrecruitment #cultawareness #coerciveorganizations #controlofinformation #cultsinAustralia #coercivecontrol #thoughtreform #cultmanipulation #brainwashing #cultcoercion #mentalhealth #isolation #cultexploitation \n\nMusic by Greeble\nInstagram: @Greeble_\n\nREFERENCES:\nThe dark reality of the Kidney Cult | 7NEWS Spotlight\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_D64VS-Owc\n\nAustralian Link in Kenya\u2019s Doomsday Cult\nhttps://www.africa.com/australian-link-in-kenyas-doomsday-cult/\n\n\u201CPredatory cult\u201D: the shadow of Unification Church over Abe\u2019s funeral\nhttps://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/predatory-cult-shadow-unification-church-over-abe-s-funeral\n\nInside the bizarre recruitment tactics of the Shincheonji \u2018doomsday\u2019 church\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/17/how-the-shincheonji-doomsday-church-targets-and-recruits-people-in-australia-ntwnfb\n\nUntold stories of South Korean cult JMS more horrifying and cruel, says Netflix show\u2019s director\nhttps://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/untold-stories-of-korean-cult-church-jms-are-more-horrifying-and-cruel-netflix-show-s-director-says\n\nReligious Group Slammed As \u201CCoercive Cult\u201D After Pushing Members To Donate Their Kidneys\nhttps://www.boredpanda.com/kidney-cult-inside-church-encourages-followers-to-donate-organs/\n\nThe Dark Shadow Cast by Moon Sun Myung\u2019s Unification Church and Abe Shinzo\nhttps://apjjf.org/2022/17/mcgill\n\nShincheonji founder under criminal investigation\nhttps://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2024/11/113_285374.html\n\nSouth Korean prosecutors seek 30-year jail term for JMS cult leader charged with sexual assault\nhttps://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/south-korean-prosecutors-seek-30-year-jail-term-for-jms-cult-leader-charged-with-sexual-assault",

      "title": "Ignorance is Strength: Coercive Control relies on victims not seeing the strings being pulled",
      "description": "The biggest lie \u0022Brother Dave\u0022 (McKay) uses to keep followers under his control is that they are working for God not money. In reality, they are providing free labour that supports McKay\u0027s publishing business, all under the guise of religious devotion. McKay achieve\u0027s this by oppressing the flow of information to his followers: their ignorance gives him strength. \n\nBrother Dave may not be profiting millions of dollars off his followers, but that\u0027s not the point. Irrespective of how much or how little money McKay is making, he is still coercing people work for him - advancing his reputations as an author and script writer - without due compensation. They are not even allowed to have a holiday from this work! They are expected to work for him 5.5 days a weeks and are prevented from communicating from with their family and friends, unless it is under surveillance from agents that play a role similar to the \u0022thought police\u0022 in 1984. \n\nAdditional information about the situation: \n\nBrother Dave\u0027s followers are expected to work at least full time hours every week. \n\nTheir duties include: physically distributing books, DVDs, and pamphlets (authored by Brother Dave) or working on YouTube videos (mostly scripted by Brother Dave) and/or supporting the monetorised channels that promote the videos. Money sources include: collecting cash donations via distribution (Brother Dave\u0027s policy is to never give books, DVDs, or pamphlets away for free); online book sales (from various online distributers); donations given to his YouTube channel (I wonder how many kidney recipients give anonymous donations on a regular basis?), and money earned from YouTube. Some of this money goes towards follower\u0027s overheads like rent and petrol, with the rest going back into the system to produce more books (printing costs), DVDs, pamphlets, and YouTube videos. \n\nThe group warehouses massive stockpiles of publications in various locations around the world. In some instances, but not all, followers are required to purchase the books off McKay prior to distributing them on the streets. That\u0027s right - Brother Dave sells his books to \u0022volunteer\u0022 distributors.  \n\nQuotas for sells/likes/subscriptions are set. If these are not met then degrading comments about being \u0022out of spirit\u0022 are issues to low performers. Spreadsheets of distribution are tallied and high achievers receive pitiful rewards like an extra $5 a week on top of fuel rations. \n\nThe saddest part is that these so-called \u0022volunteer\u0022 workers are under such tight surveillance and scrutiny from Brother Dave, that they do not have the opportunity take a step back and see the manipulative strings that are being pulled on them. \n\nMcKay\u0027s business may or may not make a lot of money, but that\u0027s not the point. The point is that he has an oppressed labour force that is working for him without the protection of Fair Work. This is not freedom of religion, this is exploitation, plain and simple. \n\n\nCREDITS\nMusic: \u201CBuster\u201D by Greeble\nInstagram: @Greeble_ \nhttps://www.instagram.com/greeble_/\n\nThe Age article: https://www.theage.com.au/politics/victoria/satanist-melbourne-kidney-cult-youtube-sermon-sparks-defamation-battle-20221013-p5bpj8.html\n\nImages created by ChatGBT",

In a continuation of the Little Red Riding Hood them, I draw similarities between these features and wolves. \n\nREFERENCES\nhttps://www.ag.gov.au/families-and-marriage/families/family-violence/coercive-control#what-is-coercive-control\n\nIMAGES\nRomulus \u0026 Remus\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=16512985\n\nOdin Picture by Carl Emil Doepler\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=5251205\n\nIrish wolf by Chris Oxford \nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=45397989\n\nPhoto of wolf: By Gary Kramer\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=30605\n\nWolf with prey\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=19584974\n\nEtching of little red\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=567608\n\nPainting of wolf \u0026 kids\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=87500194\n\nWolves biting\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=24491190\n\nBlack and while wolves\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=19771230\n\nEurasian wolf at zoo/snew\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=95523086\n\nLone wolf: By Alfred Wierusz-Kowalski\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=32001530\n\nFranciszek Wastkowski\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=87977778\n\nAlfred Wierusz-Kowalski\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=131560510\n\nAgnus: By \u041A\u043E\u043D\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043D\u0442\u0438\u043D \u041A\u043E\u0440\u043E\u0431\u043E\u0432\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=125974883\n\nStado wilk\u00F3w\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=19204322\n\nChaperon Rouge\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=141041845\n\nWolf rei\u00DFt ein Lamm\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=67979335\n\nFight between Dogs and Wolves\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=97996445\n\nMural al carrer de les Carabasses, Val\u00E8ncia: By Joanbanjo\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=30923439\n\nLe loup et l\u0027agneau\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=27621745\n\nTrois femmes et trois loups\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=2735455\n\n\u0421\u0446\u0435\u043D\u0430 \u0441 \u0432\u043E\u043B\u043A\u0430\u043C\u0438 \u0432 \u043B\u0435\u0441\u0443\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=22460833\n\nPhotograph of Little Red Riding Hood\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=40253595\n\nThe last British Wolf\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=14732183\n\nDrawing of wolf in grandma clothing\nWalter_Crane26.jpg \n\nWolves Devouring a Horse\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=91938737\n\nFight between wolves and dogs\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=124556443\n\nWolves attacking sleigh cart\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=33311546\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=96976810\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood 1881\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=26016098\n\n\u041A\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043D\u0430\u044F \u0448\u0430\u043F\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0430 1887\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=18515652\n\nFarkasok\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=57766022\n\nIllustration of the legend of Gelert\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=9831593\n\nSh\u00F3-me-k\u00F3s-see, The Wolf, a Chief \nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=66387902\n\nBuffalo Hunt, White Wolves Attacking Buffalo Bull\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=23252196\n\nNapad wilk\u00F3w 1883\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=292429\n\nWolf in a Landscape Southern Netherlandish School Bonnefantenmuseum\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=80151615\n\nSibirischer Wolf\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=48840890\n\nGrabado antiguo de una manada de lobos\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=2688978\n\nWolf in a Rocky landscape c.1650\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=95054337\n\nA wolf\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=67183809\n\nWolves: By Johan Tir\u00E9n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=22931683\n\nDie W\u00F6lfe (Balkankrieg), 1913:\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=27830879\n\nBehavior of wolves hunting bison\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=56209550\n\nFolio 29r from a 13th century Bestiary, The Rochester Bestiary\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=344113\n\nWhite Wolves Attacking a Buffalo Bull\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=66361164\n\nWounded Buffalo Bull Surrounded by White Wolves:\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=66361291\n\nCh\u00E1h-ee-ch\u00F3pes, Four Wolves, a Chief in Mourning\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=66389721\n\nRoelant Savery -
