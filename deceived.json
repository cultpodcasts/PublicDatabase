      "description": "Some believe he was the greatest martial arts master that ever lived; faster and more powerful than Bruce Lee, more feared than Chuck Norris. To his followers, he had supernatural powers. Some said he could levitate and walk up the sides of buildings. To others, he appeared as a demon beast that haunted their dreams. On DECEIVED, we will peel away the mystery of a Korean immigrant who rose from being a janitor, to running a martial art school empire. This is the true story of the notorious martial art cult known as Chung Moo Quan; its powerful leader, Master John C. Kim.",

It was all instinct at this point. Standing in the bedroom was Keith Brown. He told Russell his waterbed was facing the wrong direction; it was bad to sleep with his head facing north. Keith explained that there was a certain bad energy from the north that could get into the mind at night, if he slept with his head facing north. Russell took this as a reference to North Korea.

      "description": "Russell was told, that Master Kim said a Chung Moo Quan instructor had 3 weaknesses: women, alcohol, and gambling. He was told that women were faulted by design, and that they had no minds. An instructor could lose his mind over a woman; they want control over the relationship, and the man. Russell had a hard time with this thinking, because he was raised by his mother, one of the most wonderful people he\u2019d ever known. One of the stories Keith liked to repeat was that, as part of Master Kim\u2019s training, Grandmaster Wang Po ordered him to sleep with 3,000 women. Not only was he to sleep with them, but get a picture with each one. The purpose of the story was, to say Master Kim had a deeper understanding of women, which could be used to justify his non-feminist views taught at School. It was said that after Master Kim had slept with all these women, they either became nuns or committed suicide, because they could not be with him. This was before digital cameras; Russell\u2019s thought was: that the Master\u2019s film development bill each month must have been huge.",

      "description": "Part of learning to handle a Chung Moo Quan Martial Arts School involved giving a private lesson. Each \u2018information\u2019 that came into the School was treated differently- Everyone\u2019s searching for something; that\u2019s what brought them to the School. The instructor\u2019s job was to figure out what that was. When they came in, instructors used \u2018sideways conversation\u2019 to ask questions without revealing the agenda. The first thing was to get them to take a free private lesson. Once they agreed, have them sign a release form, which was known in the School as the DDM form, which stood for - \u2018death doesn\u2019t matter\u2019. There was a story that an \u2018information\u2019 came into a Chicago School, signed the form, challenged the instructor, and the man was killed. The release form stated that death may occur during private lessons at the School, so they release all rights to hold the School responsible. Most of the time you wouldn\u2019t tell the information what was on the form; other times you\u2019d see there was a guy who wanted to cause a problem, i.e. fight. Then you made very clear the form says death may occur. If they still wanted to fight, you gave them a quarter and pointed at the gas station across the street and told them to go call 911 because after the fight one of us would be leaving in an ambulance.",

Russell watched as Aden performed acupressure, knowledge that he believed Master Kim had passed on to Aden. Keith told of an instructor in the Chicago area, who\u2019d been dying in the hospital with some mysterious disease, that most assumed was cancer. All the doctors were in the hospital room, surrounding the instructor, when \u201CMaster\u201D Kim entered. When he saw Master Kim, the instructor tried to get up from his death bed to bow, but Master Kim told him to stay down. Master Kim made all the doctors leave the room, even though they disagreed wildly. A short time later, Master Kim opened the door to announce, the instructor had been cured. The doctors were amazed and bewildered.",

Inside the practice area the National Instructors placed a prayer, from Master, behind the Korean and American flags. This is similar to a christening ceremony, in this case the blessing of Master Kim. Believing that Master Kim had the ability to put his mind into objects, this ritual allowed Master Kim to put his mind into the School. From that day forward, when they entered the practice area for the first time each day, they would stand toward the flags in bowing position. This was a long bow, so they could clear their minds of all outside influences and direct their thoughts towards Master Kim and Chung Moo Quan training. The ritual was silent and meditative. Russell would learn years later that the prayer note, placed behind the flags, asked to make Master Kim one of the richest men in the world. Russell thought Master Kim believed that if enough instructors bowed to the flags and thought about him, it would increase the chances of the prayer being answered.",

It would be the topic of internet chat rooms, discussion boards, and private conversations. Oddly enough, it was the one topic that the Moo would not comment on. In 1991, Russell Johnson first heard the name of John Brice Maddox, during a meeting with Assistant Illinois Attorney General Lynn Worley. Worley, who was suing the Moo Schools for consumer fraud, told Russell that Maddox drowned in the pool at the farm. She was curious about details of the death, but no one was talking. Worley searched public records, and discovered that two years after John\u2019s death, someone got a moving violation using his driver\u2019s license.",

      "description": "Chung Moo Quan: The Cult and the Con In the mid-1980s Pam Zekman, an investigative reporter for CBS Affiliate WBBM TV in Chicago, received a tip about the Chung Moo Quan martial arts schools, and started an investigation. Zekman is known for her aggressive investigative work. She has shared two Pulitzer Prizes for investigative reporting, for the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times. One of the tips was about a woman who started taking her son into a local Chung Moo Quan school for lessons. While waiting for her son during his lessons, she began a friendship with the instructor and enrolled in lessons herself. The friendship was said to have possibly evolved into a relationship. The married woman\u2019s family intervened, and hired Clinical Psychologist Dr. Edwin Morse to counsel her. According to Dr. Morse, in the spring of 1988 he began working with the woman, who was involved in Chung Moo Quan in the Chicago area. During this therapy, it became evident to him, that the woman was following behavioral and attitudinal practices contrary to her normal mode of operating, before she entered the School. Russell Johnson talked with her husband and he told him that he had hired someone to follow Master Kim, and take pictures of him. The pictures, along with a note, were sent to Master Kim, saying that he could be gotten to, and to leave the man and his family alone. The harassment stopped after that. He expressed to Russell Johnson that he would like nothing better than to see Master Kim dead. Russell took him seriously, but at the time could not comprehend why someone could hate Master Kim so much, that they would want him dead and now Russell Johnson says he is happy that Kim is dead.",

      "description": "Deceived Podcast Series, show host Charles Hubbell interviews Steve Hassan, founder of the Freedom of Mind Resource Center. For nearly four decades, Steve has lectured and counseled about brainwashing, deprogramming, mind control, cults, and undue influence. As a 19-year-old college student, he was recruited into the Unification Church, or Moonies, and rose to the rank of Assistant Director, even personally meeting Reverend Sun Myung Moon. Within three years, however, Steve was helping people exit destructive cults and, over the years, he developed non-coercive methods to help cult members quit their groups. In 1990, after reading one of Steve\u2019s books, podcast producer Russell Johnson sought out the author and received counseling from him. Steve put Russell in contact with a reporter working on a story about Chung Moo Quan, which led to Russell speaking out for the first time in public about the Moo. In this interview, Steve explains everything you always wanted to know about cults \u2013 or not \u2013 but were afraid to ask, including recruitment, avoidance, exit strategies, deprogramming, and how one becomes stronger for exiting and surviving a cult. Steve also discusses cult leaders: how cults \u201Cclone\u201D the leader\u2019s image, and their common type of narcissistic psychopathological personality disorder. \u0022Deceived: The Moo Years\u0022 is the true story of one young man\u0027s compelling, at times terrifying, former involvement with the martial arts cult Chung Moo Quan.",
