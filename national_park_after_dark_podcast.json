      "description": "Today we speak with Michelle Dowd, the author of the newly released book, Forager. Field Notes for Surviving a Cult. Michelle was raised within the boundaries of Angeles National Forest inside of a religious cult her grandfather created. She was raised to believe that the end of the world was near and in turn, was taught to forage off the land, navigate by the stars, and survive. After enduring years of abuse, she finally escaped. Now, after years of healing and moving forward with her life, she has put out a book detailing her story. In this episode, we all get the chance to know Michelle as we discuss her book, her past, and where she is at in her life today.\n\n\n\nYou can buy Michelle\u0027s book here (https://www.amazon.com/Forager-Field-Surviving-Family-Memoir/dp/1643751859)  or at your local bookstore.\n\n\n\nWe love our National Parks and we know you do too but when you\u0027re out there, remember to enjoy the view but watch your back.
