      "description": "In Episode 22 of the Pinky J Podcast, we dive into the harrowing story of Nancy, a survivor of the notorious WWASPS (World Wide Association of Specialty Programs and Schools). Founded in 1998 by Robert Lichfield, WWASPS claimed to provide education and treatment for troubled teens but was plagued by allegations of severe abuse and manipulation.\n\nNancy recounts her time at Red River Academy in Louisiana, where she faced abusive punishments and isolation at just 13 years old. She later endured the horrors of Seneca Ranch, an illegally operating facility owned by Narvin Lichfield. Nancy\u0027s personal connections with the Lichfield family, their homes in Utah, and the lasting impact of these experiences are unveiled in this powerful episode.\n\nHer story is one of resilience and survival, shedding light on the dark reality behind WWASPS. For a deeper exploration of these disturbing practices, watch the documentary The Program on Netflix.\n\nJoin us as we uncover the shadows and celebrate Nancy\u0027s strength in overcoming her past.",
