      "title": "When Mentors Become Tormentors || The Lighthouse Group, the UK Cult in your Neighbourhood",
      "description": "Fear, manipulation, a horrendous abuse of trust, and another case of data protection being used as an excuse - just some of the shocking stories unearthed by the BBC about the Lighthouse International Group. \n\nHow a group offering life coaching to entrepreneurs in the UK failed its members in the worst way, and took over their lives, and their money, showing itself to be a cult.\n\nThis story of the cult that could be hiding in plain sight in your neighbourhood hits home hard for me for a number of reasons, including the location. It really is too close to home for comfort!\n\nOutro music: \u0027The Moonlight and Me\u0027 by The Tap Room, Epidemic Sound (via Canva Pro Content License) https://www.epidemicsound.com/artists/the-tap-room/ \n\nThe BBC reporting on the Lighthouse International Group, lead by Catrin Nye is fantastic.
