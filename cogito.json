Brainwashed devotees worshipping a crazed narcissist and ready to sacrifice anything for them.\n\nWhile Jonestown, Heaven\u2019s Gate, and the Solar Temple have given cults a violent reputation, most cults keep a much lower profile.\n\nCults are everywhere. There\u0027s probably a cult in your town. And the tricks they use to lure people in aren\u2019t complicated but rather tried and tested social manipulation tactics that anyone can fall for.\n\nSo what is a cult, how do they trap people, and how do people end up believing that volcano alien ghosts are living on their bodies? Well Let\u2019s Find Out.\n\n\nI\u0027d like to thank the Associated Press for providing me with footage for this video http://www.aparchive.com/\n\nIF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CONTRIBUTE  TO MY PATREON PLEASE SEE HERE. \n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/CogitoEdu\n\nCheck Out Nebula, a streaming service made by and for educational creators.\nhttps://watchnebula.com/cogito\n\nFollow me on twitter\n\nhttps://twitter.com/CogitoEdu\n\nOr Reddit r/cogitoedu\n\nOr Facebook @CogitoYT\n\nMERCHANDISE\n\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/cogito-store\n\nHistory Of Tea | https://youtu.be/6S0hlv5sUbw\nWhat Was The Indus Valley Civilisation? | https://youtu.be/rlONwxT9Nlc\nWhat Is Judaism | https://youtu.be/0VAylWxDQfk\nHistory Of Ancient China | Dynasties, Confucius, And The First Emperor https://youtu.be/tpy5BMhMYYw\nWho Are The San Bushmen? | https://youtu.be/1oQ5Jd7p2aY\nWhat Is Jainism? https://youtu.be/KkwmYlgkOhU\nWho Are The Berbers Of North Africa https://youtu.be/a39oM3MJleY\nWhat Is Hinduism? https://youtu.be/xlBEEuYIWwY\nWhat Is Sikhism? https://youtu.be/L-1UAORcX4c\n\n\nSources:\nLosing Reality: On Cults, Cultism, and the Mindset of Political and Religious Zealotry Robert Jay Lifton | https://amzn.to/3eVmCMI\nTerror, Love and Brainwashing: Attachment in Cults and Totalitarian Systems Alexandra Stein | https://amzn.to/30JkqTd\nCults in Our Midst Janja Lalich and Margaret Singer | https://amzn.to/30KKQnO\nMisunderstanding Cults: Searching for Objectivity in a Controversial Field Benjamin Zablocki and Thomas Robbins | https://amzn.to/30GQOWN\nCULTS A Reference Handbook James R.
