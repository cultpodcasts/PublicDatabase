      "description": "This show appeared on Inside Edition and was part of a continuing investigation into the Word of Faith Fellowship assisted by the Trinity Foundation in Dallas, TX.  One of the Foundation\u0027s investigators, Pete Evans, took a lot of hidden camera footage while investigating undercover inside the group.  In 2017, the Associated Press interviewed over a hundred ex-members about practices that were 1st exposed by Inside Edition in the mid-1990s and continue to this day.  Th AP investigation placed the Word of Faith Fellowship squarely back in the news. In this broadcast, you will see and hear some disturbing things, including Darren Lloyd  talking about his father Harold Lloyd\u0027s death inside the church.",
