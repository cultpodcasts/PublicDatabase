      "description": "A federal judge has sharply rebuked Ghislaine Maxwell after she included confidential victim names in court filings while attempting to overturn her sex trafficking conviction. U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer ordered the filings sealed, warning Maxwell against further disclosures as the Justice Department begins releasing Epstein-related records under the Epstein Files Transparency Act. The ruling comes amid growing political backlash over heavily redacted disclosures and renewed scrutiny of the Epstein case.\n\n#Trump #EpsteinFiles #GhislaineMaxwell #JeffreyEpstein #epsteinandmaxwell #PamBondi  #EpsteinCase #EpsteinScandal #EpsteinDeath #SexTrafficking #Trumpnews #KashPatel #FBI #BillGates #Hollywood #USpolitician #USnews #latestUSnews #trump #jeffreyepsteinfullcase #topnews #live #breakingnews #AttorneyGeneral  #Trumpnews #latestnews #USCourts #FederalJudge\n\n\u25BA Subscribe to The Economic Times for the latest video updates.
