      "description": "POV: A 16 year girl plants a purity flag with her dad under the shadow of The Washington Monument, proclaiming her chastity alongside hundreds of other teenage girls, under the watchful eye of the Evangelical Christian Nation. Welcome to Episode 13 of Therapists IRL, where Jen and Steph discuss the impact of religion on mental health. Join us as Steph shares a little more of her story growing up in the 90s US Purity Culture, her brush with involvement in a pseudo-cult in college, and reclamation of her identity apart from internalized shame-based messages and the impact of toxic religion.
