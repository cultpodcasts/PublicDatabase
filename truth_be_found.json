      "description": "She escaped the walls of control; now she\u2019s shedding light on the abuse that keeps others trapped. In this powerful continuation of our two-part conversation, Justin Yentes sits down once again with Rachel Jeffs, survivor, author, and daughter of FLDS leader Warren Jeffs, and Tawni Browning, an advocate for survivors.

What it takes to help survivors rebuild: housing, mental health support, etc. The impact of the series \u201CEscaping Polygamy\u201D on those still inside the FLDS.
