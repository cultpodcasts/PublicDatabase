      "description": "In our latest podcast episode, we took a closer look at the tough topic of leaving cults and the importance of thinking for ourselves. We had a deep chat with Sarah Edmondson and Nippy Ames, who shared their brave story of getting out of the NXIVM cult. This episode isn\u0027t just about their story; it\u0027s about how we all can learn to think more critically and stand up for our own beliefs.Resources:Sarah\u0027s book, Scarred: sarahedmondson.com/bookA Little Bit Culty Podcast: alittlebitculty.comSarah\u0027s website: sarahedmondson.comWatch Sarah\u2019s TEDx Talk: youtube.com/watch?v=9K_CZbu-UAUThe Vow on Max: https://www.max.com/shows/vow/9dc0d8ae-fba1-4fd3-9479-c5824fec1421Start a free trial of CTCmath.com to try the math program that\u2019s sure to grab and keep your child\u2019s attention!Curious about Brave Writer but not quite sure what it\u2019s all about?
