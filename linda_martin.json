Reporter Dan Tilkin documents how their graves joined DOZENS of other children buried nearby that have died likely because their parents won\u0027t take them to a doctor. They belong to a faith healing church called The Followers of Christ in Idaho. Idaho is one of the last places in the U.S. where a parent won\u0027t be prosecuted if their parents rely on faith healing. A branch of the Followers of Christ exists in Oregon City. After dozens of children who belong to that church died, Oregon changed its laws to protect kids. Four sets of parents were prosecuted. Meanwhile, efforts to change the law in Idaho keep getting thwarted.",
