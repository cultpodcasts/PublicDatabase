      "description": "In this episode, we break down TLC\u2019s three-part documentary event The Cult of the Real Housewife, a chilling deep dive into the allegations surrounding Real Housewives of Salt Lake City star Mary Cosby and the Faith Temple Pentecostal Church. Using leaked audio, interviews with former church members, family testimony, and expert analysis on religious cults, the documentary paints a disturbing picture of fear-based faith, financial exploitation, emotional manipulation, and absolute control. We recap all three episodes \u2014 \u201CIt\u2019s a Cult,\u201D \u201CThat\u2019s When the Trouble Started,\u201D and \u201CA Message of Fear and Control\u201D and unpack how Mary Cosby\u2019s rise to power, controversial marriage to her step-grandfather Robert Cosby Sr., and leadership style fractured families, isolated congregants, and weaponized God as a tool of domination.
