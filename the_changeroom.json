      "description": "Today\u2019s episode, featuring the brilliant and hilarious Pamela Wong, is an exploration of some of the ways that we can question and decolonize the practice of yoga. Our ways of thinking are highly informed and shaped by the scientific method and the primacy of objective knowing rather than valuing subjective experience. This is a wild romp through the fields of philosophy, scientific method, colonialism and more so strap the F in. Pamela Wong is a yoga and meditation teacher, a community organizer who has worked in and with communities in remote northern Canada for more than fifteen years and a holder of a doctorate in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from the University of Toronto. Pam holds and inhabits both Western and non-western identities and models in her approach to work, life and community and she\u2019s a damn good yoga teacher and i\u2019m lucky to have her as a friend and colleague. @pamutayo",

      "description": "The unbelievable Tareyn Johnson joins us today to talk about the intersections between yoga in North America and the wisdom traditions of Indigenous communities. The resilience of individuals and groups that have lived through colonization, cultural suppression and attempts at cultural and literal genocides continues to build and be nurtured through the practice of other ways of being and knowing that are radically different from dominant cultural norms. Tareyn Johnson is the Director of Indigenous Affairs at University of Ottawa, where she provides leadership to Indigenous Affairs and Senior Administration to develop services and programs, Indigenous Knowledge Sharing sessions for faculty, staff, and students and also integrates Indigenous communities in university life. Tareyn is also the graduate of a 200-Hour Training and a long-time yoga practitioner.

      "description": "What does it feel like to be a straight, cis-man in a yoga studio? To advance conversations on gender, patriarchy, consent and privilege, it\u2019s really fascinating to explore how wellness spaces might actually be one of few spaces where there are risks for men who attend. It\u2019s a space that is really dominated by powerful women moving in ways that are unapologetically their own\u2026it\u2019s a place where the male gaze is not prioritized even though there are a lot of ways that it could be. Dennis Van Dine has been a lot of things in his life. A mathematician, an amazing musician, a tech start-up mastermind and probably most importantly, my friend for more than twenty years. Dennis is a student but not a teacher of yoga, bringing a different perspective to the table. @dvandine",

In this wide-ranging discussion with Indu Vashist, our brilliant guest, we dig into big topics like the deliberate Scandi-whitewashed aesthetic of yoga studios, white feminine fragility, fascism, the cost of radical politiics and more. It\u2019s a juicy one (and funnier than you would think too). Indu Vashist is a second generation settler in Canada and is of Punjabi ancestry. As a teacher, Indu shares tools like guided meditation, breathwork, movement and stillness that help us ride out our thoughts, feelings and experiences as they arise. In addition to being a movement teacher, Indu is also a trained historian. @indu_geita http://induvashist.com",

      "description": "As the incredibly insightful Nya Daley points out very succinctly in this interview, if you didn\u2019t notice a difference in the way that Black people were treated in most studios in North America (and maybe beyond) after the summer of 2020, then you really weren\u2019t paying attention. In this episode, Nya skillfully unpacks the position of Black movement and meditation teachers in studios and paths to creating the right opportunities for all teachers and practitioners. Nya Daley is an Atlanta, Georgia based social worker, community builder, yoga teacher and equity, diversity and belongingness educator, equipped with over 15 years of experience working in the wellness and social service sectors.
