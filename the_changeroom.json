      "description": "What does it feel like to be a straight, cis-man in a yoga studio? To advance conversations on gender, patriarchy, consent and privilege, it\u2019s really fascinating to explore how wellness spaces might actually be one of few spaces where there are risks for men who attend. It\u2019s a space that is really dominated by powerful women moving in ways that are unapologetically their own\u2026it\u2019s a place where the male gaze is not prioritized even though there are a lot of ways that it could be. Dennis Van Dine has been a lot of things in his life. A mathematician, an amazing musician, a tech start-up mastermind and probably most importantly, my friend for more than twenty years. Dennis is a student but not a teacher of yoga, bringing a different perspective to the table. @dvandine",

      "description": "In this week\u2019s episode, we discuss the intersections (past and present) between activism and yoga. In this wide-ranging discussion with Indu Vashist, our brilliant guest, we dig into big topics like the deliberate Scandi-whitewashed aesthetic of yoga studios, white feminine fragility, fascism, the cost of radical politiics and more. It\u2019s a juicy one (and funnier than you would think too). Indu Vashist is a second generation settler in Canada and is of Punjabi ancestry. As a teacher, Indu shares tools like guided meditation, breathwork, movement and stillness that help us ride out our thoughts, feelings and experiences as they arise. In addition to being a movement teacher, Indu is also a trained historian. @indu_geita http://induvashist.com",

      "description": "As the incredibly insightful Nya Daley points out very succinctly in this interview, if you didn\u2019t notice a difference in the way that Black people were treated in most studios in North America (and maybe beyond) after the summer of 2020, then you really weren\u2019t paying attention. In this episode, Nya skillfully unpacks the position of Black movement and meditation teachers in studios and paths to creating the right opportunities for all teachers and practitioners. Nya Daley is an Atlanta, Georgia based social worker, community builder, yoga teacher and equity, diversity and belongingness educator, equipped with over 15 years of experience working in the wellness and social service sectors. Nya is the founder and lead facilitator of Soulga Yoga, a wellness collective that is rooted in empowering, highlighting and supporting BBIMP* wellness professionals by facilitating accessible and culturally relevant movement, mentorship and educational offerings. https://www.soulgawellness.com/",
