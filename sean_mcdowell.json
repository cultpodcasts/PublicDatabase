      "description": "Naomi Wright is the daughter of a pseudo-Christian cult leader. She was raised, yet hidden, within mainstream culture and public school education, where no one knew or the few with a sense of something, stayed silent. Now she holds a Master\u0027s of Science in Social Work from the University at Buffalo and is a licensed mental health professional in the state of Colorado. She also holds a Master of Arts in Christian Studies from Denver Seminary. Her areas of speciality include grief and loss, spiritual abuse, including cult abuse, as well as biblical and theological studies.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: beEmboldened on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPSnkK3zLp0nK__Tdp9ZDRQ)\n\nREAD: Be Emboldened with Naomi Wright (https://www.beemboldened.com/naomi-wright)\n\n*Get a MASTERS IN APOLOGETICS or SCIENCE AND RELIGION at BIOLA (https://bit.ly/3LdNqKf)\n\n*USE Discount Code [SMDCERTDISC] for $100 off the BIOLA APOLOGETICS CERTIFICATE program (https://bit.ly/3AzfPFM)\n\n*See our fully online UNDERGRAD DEGREE in Bible, Theology, and Apologetics: (https://bit.ly/448STKK)\n\nFOLLOW ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA: \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Sean_McDowell \nTikTok: @sean_mcdowell \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/seanmcdowell/\nWebsite: https://seanmcdowell.org",
