      "description": "In this exclusive MovieWeb interview, director Nia DaCosta breaks down the themes driving \u002728 Years Later: The Bone Temple\u0027 \u2014 from grief, love, and \u201Cmemento mori,\u201D to cult psychology, belief systems, and the unsettling idea that humans may be more dangerous than the infected.\n\nDaCosta discusses Kelson\u2019s Bone Temple as a monument to love and memory, the emotional and moral weight of his relationship with Samson, and why Jimmy Crystal represents a different kind of horror \u2014 one rooted in trauma, charisma, and corrupted meaning. She also dives into why cults are so terrifying, how people lose individuality to feel safe, and what hope looks like in a world defined by rage.\n\nThis conversation explores how The Bone Temple expands the franchise in a darker, more intimate, and deeply human direction \u2014 while still leaving audiences unsettled long after the credits roll.\n\nSUBSCRIBE \u2192 https://goo.gl/rRQ5W7 \n\nMovie news, movie trailers, movie clips \u0026 more:\nhttps://movieweb.com\nFollow us on Facebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/movieweb\nFollow us on Twitter\nhttps://twitter.com/movieweb\nFollow us on Instagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/movieweb/\n\n#niadacosta #28yearslater #28yearslaterthebonetemple #interview #podcast",
