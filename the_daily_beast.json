      "description": "Michael Wolff joins Joanna Coles to trace how a president cornered by Epstein, ICE violence, collapsing polls, and mounting legal exposure responds the only way he knows how: by grabbing territory, media, and attention at scale. From the Foxification of CBS News and the quiet corporate bargain behind it, to Trump\u2019s fixation on Greenland, Venezuela, Iran, and elite cities he loves to demonize, this episode maps a presidency fueled by distraction, intimidation, and an audience of one. Wolff unpacks why Trump\u2019s pressure-point politics now extend from network newsrooms to foreign policy theater, why even loyal institutions are bending under threat, and why the nightmare Trump is trying to outrun\u2014Epstein.\n\n00:00 - Epstein Files and Trump\u2019s Mounting Exposure\n04:29 - Trump\u2019s Broader Power Grab: Media, DOJ, and CBS\n08:56 - CBS Under Barry Weiss and the Dokoupil Interview Fallout\n13:24 - The Fox-ification of Network News and Political Anchors\n17:51 - The Decline of CBS News and the Media Business Model\n22:21 - Inside Trump\u2019s Head: Controlling Media Through Corporate Pressure\n32:39 - ICE Shooting Video and the Indefensible Moment\n36:02 - Trump Sees ICE Crackdowns as a Political Liability\n38:36 - Epstein Heckling and Trump\u2019s Public Meltdown\n41:07 - Press Raids and the Chilling Effect on Journalism\n44:13 - Trump\u2019s Obsession With \u201CElite\u201D Cities Like London\n46:45 - Epstein, the Clintons, and Trump\u2019s Greatest Risk\n\n\uD83D\uDCD6 Title: Trump Knows Epstein Could Be His Mortal Threat\n\uD83D\uDC42 Podcast: Inside Trump\u0027s Head \n\uD83D\uDCFA Episode: 61\n\uD83C\uDFA7 Format:  Full Podcast\n\uD83D\uDCC5 Date: January 15, 2026\n\uD83C\uDF99\uFE0F Hosts: Joanna Coles, Michael Wolff\n\n#trump #news #podcast \n\nSubscribe to our new YouTube channel Obsessed: https://youtube.com/@TheObsessedChannel?sub_confirmation=1\n\nClick here to become an official member of the Daily Beast\u0027s YouTube community: https://youtube.com/@thedailybeast/join\n\nHave a question or comment for us?

From Iran\u2019s uprising to Venezuela\u2019s phantom \u201Cinvasion,\u201D Wolff explains how Trump exploits uncertainty by announcing conflicts he has no intention of prosecuting, using noise, grandiosity, and endless talking to stay at the center of attention while avoiding real risk or consequence. The conversation ranges from ICE and Minneapolis to Greenland, shoes, height, and the limits of loyalty, before landing on the most dangerous question of all: What happens when Trump\u2019s talent for manufactured crises collides with a real one\u2014Russia, Iran, or a nuclear threat he cannot simply talk his way out of?\n\n\uD83D\uDCD6 Title: The One Thing That Truly Terrifies Trump: Wolff\n\uD83D\uDC42 Podcast: Inside Trump\u0027s Head \n\uD83D\uDCFA Episode: 59\n\uD83C\uDFA7 Format:  Full Podcast\n\uD83D\uDCC5 Date: January 10, 2026\n\uD83C\uDF99\uFE0F Hosts: Joanna Coles, Michael Wolff\n\n#trump #podcast #news \n\nSubscribe to our new YouTube channel Obsessed: https://youtube.com/@TheObsessedChannel?sub_confirmation=1\n\nClick here to become an official member of the Daily Beast\u0027s YouTube community: https://youtube.com/@thedailybeast/join\n\nVisit our new Beauty website The Looker: https://thelooker.thedailybeast.com/\n\nHave a question or comment for us?

      "description": "Michael Wolff joins Joanna Coles to unpack one of the most confounding political inversions of the Trump era: the moment when lying stopped being a liability and became a source of power. Wolff argues that while past presidents were undone by exposed falsehoods, Trump\u2019s credibility has never been weaker\u2014and yet it has only strengthened him. Together, they examine how shamelessness, repetition, and brute insistence on an alternate reality have replaced truth as a governing tool, leaving institutions, media, and public protest strangely inert. From the collapse of shared reality to the media\u2019s inability to name what\u2019s happening in plain language, this episode digs into why transparent lies no longer undermine authority\u2014and what it means when reality itself stops working as a check on power.\n\n00:00 - Venezuela, Epstein, and a Trump Crisis\n03:30 - Are We Slipping Into Autocracy?\n07:00 - Stephen Miller\u2019s Rise and Dark Ideology\n10:30 - Trump, Force Politics, and Dangerous Parallels\n14:00 - ICE Shooting, Lies, and the Credibility Collapse\n17:30 - Media Normalizes Trump\u2019s Venezuela Invasion\n21:00 - RFK Jr., Miller, and the Madness Inside Power\n26:56 - Politics as a Job for Life\n27:29 - Why MAGA Likes Seth Moulton\n29:02 - Why Politicians Fail to Sound Human\n31:07 - The Mark Kelly Blowback Explained\n33:36 - Trump\u2019s Performative Overreaction\n35:34 - Should Politics Stay Out of High School?\n38:08 - Why Epstein Never Goes Away\n41:13 - Venezuela as Trump\u2019s Ultimate Distraction\n42:05 - The Greenland Illusion Explained\n47:27 - The Trump-ification of the Smithsonian\n48:48 - Why There\u2019s No Real Resistance\n49:57 - How Bad Is It for America, Really?\n\n\uD83D\uDCD6 Title: Why Trump Can\u0027t Escape Epstein Forever: Wolff\n\uD83D\uDC42 Podcast: Inside Trump\u0027s Head \n\uD83D\uDCFA Episode: 58\n\uD83C\uDFA7 Format:  Full Podcast\n\uD83D\uDCC5 Date: January 8, 2026\n\uD83C\uDF99\uFE0F Hosts: Joanna Coles, Michael Wolff\n\n#trump #news #podcast \n\nClick here to become an official member of the Daily Beast\u0027s YouTube community: https://youtube.com/@thedailybeast/join\n\nVisit our new Beauty website The Looker: https://thelooker.thedailybeast.com/\n\nHave a question or comment for us?

Drawing on years of interviews and firsthand reporting, Wolff argues that Trump and Epstein were not casual acquaintances but intimate allies, bonded by money, sex, models, and a shared outsider resentment of New York\u2019s elite. The episode traces how that alliance curdled into rivalry and fear\u2014through real estate betrayals, private planes, kompromat, and the moment Epstein believed Trump turned the authorities on him. Wolff details why Epstein obsessed over Trump even after their rupture, why other powerful men fell while Trump survived, and how Epstein\u2019s arrest and death intersected with Trump\u2019s presidency. If Epstein was the man who knew Trump best, what does it mean that this is the one story that still visibly unnerves him?\n\n#trump #podcast #news \n\nClick here to become an official member of the Daily Beast\u0027s YouTube community: https://youtube.com/@TheDailyBeast/join\n\nVisit our new Beauty website The Looker: https://thelooker.thedailybeast.com/\n\nHave a question or comment for us?

With shocking claims of assassination plots and palace cover-ups, nothing about this saga is as simple as it seems.

Wolff begins with their bond in the late-1980s New York, where Trump was chasing Manhattan legitimacy and Epstein was emerging as a fixer fluent in money, women, and leverage. From Trump introducing Epstein as \u201Cmy associate\u2014Jeffy,\u201D a pattern forms of shared ambition, cruelty, and secrecy. Wolff links those early dynamics to Trump\u2019s financial near-collapse in the 1990s and Epstein\u2019s claim that he helped Trump survive bankruptcy while keeping his tax returns hidden. If Epstein helped shape Trump\u2019s instincts before power, what does that say about the secrets that still follow him now?\n\n#trump #news #podcast \n\nClick here to become an official member of the Daily Beast\u0027s YouTube community: https://youtube.com/@TheDailyBeast/join\n\nVisit our new Beauty website The Looker: https://thelooker.thedailybeast.com/\n\nHave a question or comment for us?

From Pete Hegseth\u2019s troubling battlefield lore to Keystone Kash Patel\u2019s chaos, Wolff charts a mood shift that even Murdoch-world can\u2019t quite hide. Wolff outlines how Jeffrey Epstein once warned that Trump would misuse his pardon power, as evinced by Trump\u2019s pardon of Honduran ex-president and cocaine trafficker Juan Orlando Hern\u00E1ndez. Joanna presses the central question of the hour: Is this the moment when Trump\u2019s own allies decide the circus has finally become a liability?\n\nClick here to buy tickets for Inside Trump\u0027s Head with Michael Wolff and Joanna Coles live: https://www.92ny.org/event/joanna-coles-and-michael-wolff\n\n\uD83D\uDCD6 Title: Epstein\u0027s Warning About Trump is Coming True: Wolff\n\uD83D\uDC42 Podcast: Inside Trump\u0027s Head \n\uD83D\uDCFA Episode: 42\n\uD83C\uDFA7 Format: Full Podcast\n\uD83D\uDCC5 Date: December 2, 2025\n\uD83C\uDF99\uFE0F Hosts: Joanna Coles, Michael Wolff\n\n#news #trump #podcast \n\nClick here to become an official member of the Daily Beast\u0027s YouTube community: https://youtube.com/@thedailybeast/join\n\nVisit our new Beauty website The Looker: https://thelooker.thedailybeast.com/\n\nHave a question or comment for us?
