From mass shootings to corruption, donors, and a cabinet quietly hedging its bets, they trace how Trump\u2019s personal brokenness has become national policy\u2014and ask the defining question: How long can a political system function when it\u2019s built around one man\u2019s pathology?\n\n\uD83D\uDCD6 Title: Trump\u0027s Vile Reiner Post Confirms He\u0027s a Sociopath\n\uD83D\uDC42 Podcast: The Daily Beast Podcast\n\uD83D\uDCFA Episode: 624\n\uD83C\uDFA7 Format: Full Podcast\n\uD83D\uDCC5 Date: December 15, 2025\n\uD83D\uDC68\u200D\uD83D\uDCBC Guest: David Rothkopf\n\uD83C\uDF99\uFE0F Host: Joanna Coles\n\n#news #podcast #trump \n\nClick here to become an official member of the Daily Beast\u0027s YouTube community: https://youtube.com/@TheDailyBeast/join\n\nVisit our new Beauty website The Looker: https://thelooker.thedailybeast.com/\n\nHave a question or comment for us?

      "description": "Andrew Lownie joins Joanna Coles to examine wild new reporting that Jeffrey Epstein tried to hire a British sniper to kill Prince Andrew \u2014 a story now echoed by two separate sources. Joanna presses into the fever-dream paranoia that surrounded Epstein in his final years and the ripple effects now hitting the palace. Lownie, author of the bombshell book \u2018Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York,\u2019 explains why, if true, this plot reframes Epstein\u2019s reach and the danger surrounding everyone in his orbit. And Joanna ends by asking the blunt question lingering under all of it: what else was Epstein willing to do that we still don\u2019t know?\n\n#podcast #news #royalfamily \n\n\uD83D\uDCD6 Title: I Read FBI\u0027s Wild Epstein and Andrew Files: Author\n\uD83D\uDC42 Podcast: The Daily Beast Podcast\n\uD83D\uDCFA Episode: 612\n\uD83C\uDFA7 Format: Full Podcast\n\uD83D\uDCC5 Date: November 17, 2025\n\uD83D\uDC68\u200D\uD83D\uDCBC Guest: Andrew Lownie\n\uD83C\uDF99\uFE0F Host: Joanna Coles\n\nClick here to become an official member of the Daily Beast\u0027s YouTube community: https://youtube.com/@thedailybeast/join\n\nHave a question or comment for us?
