Claire shares what the daily routine was like in the TM community, how it felt believing every adult she knew could levitate, and the powerful mystique of Maharishi. Plus, she tells how the fall of the Berlin Wall and her subscription to Cosmopolitan magazine helped lead to her eventual awakening about the guru being a mere mortal, and the book she wrote about that experience, Greetings From Utopia Park.

Plus: the patterns and red flags she\u2019s learned to spot, why spiritual language is often used to disguise harm, and what to do if you get sued by your group for speaking out.

The girls then transition from the topic of her particular cult to a discussion on the cult-like patterns of the current American political landscape, and how to approach political disagreements with loved ones. Akina also reflects on her article for Salon, where she explores how the Trump administration employs many of the same tactics used by Reverend Moon, and how high-control groups tend to choose a group to scapegoat for their problems. They discuss the demonization of immigrants and trans folks, the realities of ICE kidnappings, and how the failures of political leadership effectively addressing income inequality created an opening for demagogues to thrive.

They\u2019re going to tell us how they got started writing about 3HO, both interacting with Kundalini yoga in different ways, who Yogi Bhajan was and whether he had any credibility in the Sikh religion (spoiler: he did not), and how he began to get white Americans to believe he was the ultimate spiritual authority, rapidly expanding and profiting off of the money and property of his followers. They\u2019ll tell us about some of the many ways Yogi Bhajan exerted control over his followers lives, the practice of separating children from their parents in a practice called \u201Cdistance therapy,\u201D and the boarding schools kids were sent to for years that turned out to be neglectful and abusive, all within full knowledge and approval of Yogi Bhajan. Plus, the wave of survivors that came forward to tell their stories of his and the organization\u2019s abuse, and how they were failed by 3HO\u2019s reparations program. We have deals for you!

      "description": "Groups!... I did it again. Jay Van Bavel, NYU Associate Professor of Psychology and Neural Science, Director of the Social Identity and Morality Lab, and co-author of The Power Of Us, discusses how our social identities change depending on our environment and context, how the groups we identify with affect our decisions and perception, and the importance of instilling healthy hierarchy in a group to prevent unhealthy leadership. They also discuss how emotionally charged situations can forge shared identities, how cults replace individual identities with group identities, what to do when someone has fallen prey to groupthink, and whether groups are even... good?

She\u2019ll tell us about her upbringing and her career as a young actor, living in LA on her own and joining a small Bible study group that seemed like the perfect place to share a community with like-minded young Christian actors, and how a charismatic preacher named Les began showing up, leading the meetings, and changing everything.\nShe\u2019ll tell us about going to a house in Idaho they called the \u201CGod spa,\u201D how she was drugged at the house (but did not realize until later), and how Les began to exert more and more control over her life - including isolating her from her family and taking over her finances, which were being drained without her knowledge the entire time she was working on a hit television show - and how the group\u2019s hold over her led her to turning down her dream role in her dream Broadway play.\nPlus, how she discovered her money was gone and finally decided to leave.\n\nWe have deals for you!!!\nPretty Litter: Looking for the right litter?

We also compare the similarities of Anne\u0027s experience with that of many cult leaders, how coming out of a paranoid delusion is similar to coming out of a cult belief, and why it can be wise NOT to directly attack the beliefs of someone experiencing a psychotic episode.\n\nTrust Me is brought to you by Shopify!

      "description": "Today our guest is Gareth Gore, journalist and author whose new book Opus is about Opus Dei, an ultra-conservative Catholic sect, its harmful practices, its history of dark money, and its connections to modern day right-wing American politics. Gareth shares how he came to this story while investigating the shady practices at a bank in Spain, the history of the group and the leader\u2019s goals of recruiting elite members of society, and its cultic practices like living in gender segregated homes with a highly controlled life and doing body mortification rituals. He tells about how members would groom kids as young as 11 or 12 to become people of influence in the group, how there are a number of reports of trafficking low-income young women and girls in various countries to exploit their labor at Opus Dei retreats, how some people were fed a cocktail of prescription drugs they didn\u2019t need, and whether there\u2019s been any accountability for these practices\u2014which the group tries to officially distance themselves from. Plus, its ties to prominent US conservative activist Leonard Leo, who\u2019s had an outsized influence in naming three of our current Supreme Court appointees and who\u2019s tied to Project 2025, seeking to \u201Ccrush liberal dominance.\u201D Check out our great sponsors!!

We\u2019ll talk about why it was exciting in the beginning to connect with other women in a new way, how other subgroups began to form (including one secret, exclusive one) and how the admin, who we\u2019ll call Vivian, seemed to be creating a space that prioritized social justice, equality, and helping other people\u2014at first. Norah shares how the culture of the secret smaller group, Girls Night In, began to change, becoming a place where posting nudes was normalized and encouraged, sending them to other people\u2019s boyfriends, and attacking anyone who deviated from Vivian\u2019s ideas about what was good or bad. Plus, red flags that popped up along the way, controversies that made Norah begin to question, and how the group finally collapsed. Trust Me is sponsored by BetterHelp!

We discuss how they strictly controlled their followers\u0027 diets, made them take a mysterious elixir while on retreats, and how they made their sales pitch to them while they were under the influence.

While Sara\u2019s specialty lies more in optimization of the nonprofit workplace, we\u2019re going to have more of a philosophical discussion about how we\u2019re expected to just trust in our tech overlords without questioning - both the CEOs and the algorithms themselves - how it\u2019s a sort of coercion to be handed algorithms and apps with no say in or understanding of how they work, and how AI factors into all of it. We\u2019ll talk about the difficulty of reining in tech fast enough, how social media is dulling our critical thinking skills, and what she sees as a better approach to tech - and life in general.

      "description": "Today is part one with Min Zhou, Distinguished Professor of Sociology and Asian American Studies at UCLA, who also grew up during the Cultural Revolution: a decade of social chaos in China in the 1960s and 1970s where intellectuals, artists, and anyone perceived as representing capitalism or the \u0022old ways\u0022 were persecuted and murdered in the hundreds of thousands or more. She\u2019ll tell us about the backstory leading to this moment in history, who Mao Zedong was and what the country\u0027s climate was like when he began to use propaganda to create a cult of personality around himself, and the movement to \u201Cpurge,\u201D through psychological or violent means, anyone who disagreed with Mao\u2019s policies.\nShe\u2019ll tell us about just how far the fanaticism and propaganda around Chairman Mao went, who the Red Guards were and how they initially seemed just like a cool subculture of young people when she was a kid - until they began to grow more destructive - and why her father was an immediate target. Plus, next week, we\u2019ll discuss the labor camps her parents were sent to, and what it was like trying to survive while they were away.\n\nCheck out our amazing sponsors this week!\u00A0\nCBDistillery: Reset your health!

She\u2019ll talk about how her time trying to save her baby in the children\u2019s hospital, plus working with women doctors and nurses, planted the seeds to help her imagine a world that wasn\u2019t completely run by men. She discusses moving to more heavily patriarchal churches, how the churches may change but it\u2019s all part of the same larger evangelical culture, and how she joined a more extreme and isolated one as her husband became more authoritarian. Plus, she touches on her recovery process, as well as the ongoing and growing danger of fundamentalist Christianity in the United States government.

Tia tells us about the culture of domestic abuse in the heavily patriarchal evangelical communities, including practices like wife spanking, and how various church leaders would enable the abuse.

She\u2019s going to talk to us about Munchausen by Proxy, or medical child abuse, from a new point of view: what it\u2019s like being related to the perpetrator. She\u2019ll tell us about what her sister was like growing up, how she had exhibited Munchausen behaviors from a very young age, making herself seem to be sick before she had children, and how common that and other forms of deception are among people who later develop Munchausen by Proxy. We\u2019ll talk about how her sister faked a pregnancy and miscarriage and how the discovery of that messed with Andrea\u2019s reality, the overlap of characteristics with people who exhibit signs of narcissism and psychopathy, and how actual medical misogyny complicates the whole thing. And next week, we\u2019ll talk about what her sister started doing to her children, what her family tried to do about it, and why they weren\u2019t able to stop her.",

      "description": "Today our guest is J. Wesley Boyd, psychiatrist, professor, and the director of education at the Harvard Medical School Center for Bioethics. He joins us to talk about Physician Health Programs, (or PHPs) which are under-the-radar programs that most states have. They\u0027re supposed to be a place where doctors who are struggling with substance abuse or mental illness can go to recover. But Wes shares how a shocking number of doctors who do *not* have a substance use disorder are coerced into for-profit inpatient treatment that rips them away from their lives and costs them tens of thousands of dollars of their own money. And if they don\u2019t comply with every demand, they\u2019ll very likely lose their medical licenses. We\u2019ll talk about the benevolent origin of PHPs, the profit motives that corrupted so many them over time, examples of folks who experienced this coercion at the expense of their mental health and career, and how no one believes people who were victims of them - which is why it\u2019s important for people like Wes, who worked for one as a psychiatrist, to speak out. And as always, we will discuss the exceptions, because of course there are people who have been helped by them too. Check out our great sponsors!!

Jordyn shares how they were medicated by their mom as a child, receiving surgery and treatments for conditions they never had, how they came to realize they had experienced MCA, and what it was like discovering evidence on their medical records, including learning that one doctor had tried to help.  Plus, can perpetrators be treated? Can it be passed down? What\u0027s the difference between hypochondria and MCA, and what\u0027s the path to recovery for survivors?

They discuss the overseer who was found dead in a hotel and the letter that exposed his sexual abuse, and how Kyle and Kari were then flooded with messages from survivors who\u0027d been sexually abused within the religion, with hundreds of perpetrators named (many by multiple victims), and the earth-shattering implications for the future of the group.

Keith Page, funeral celebrant, hospice chaplain, and death doula/midwife, shares what it was like being a pastor of large church and why parts of that experience made him uncomfortable, his fall from grace that led him to turn away from religion, and how he found his calling by helping people deal with death from a secular perspective. Plus, how you can find meaning and define your own values without religion, what Keith\u0027s end of life work actually entails (yes, sometimes there\u0027s dry ice involved), and the importance of normalizing death in our society.\u00A0  Trust Me is sponsored by Progressive Insurance!

      "description": "Once called \u201Cthe miracle on the beach,\u201D Synanon began in the 1960s as an experimental rehab facility in Santa Monica, California with a radical claim: It could cure heroin addiction. Before long, it would make an even bolder claim: It could cure any of your problems. All you had to do was move in. What started in a house on the beach, soon spread to compounds across the country. The man who made the miracle happen, Charles E. Dederich, aka \u201CChuck,\u201D would be the one to destroy it all, along with the lives of many of his followers and millions of dollars in assets. The Sunshine Place tells the mind-blowing, true-story of Synanon - one of America\u2019s most cutting edge social experiments, turned into one of its most dangerous and violent cults - as it\u2019s never been told before: by the people who lived it. Executive Produced by Robert Downey Jr., Susan Downey, and Emily Barclay Ford for Team Downey and C13Originals, together with Josh McLaughlin for Wink Pictures and written, produced, and directed by Peabody-nominated C13Originals, a Cadence13 Studio.",

CEO of the Arizona Trauma Institute and President at the Trauma Institute International Dr Robert Rhoton digs into the physiology of trauma, why the particular therapeutic model isn\u2019t THAT important (as long as our therapists are trauma-informed), how being dysregulated is akin to a certain Marvel character, and why it\u2019s important for our therapists to be regulated themselves.
