Some of you may remember our previous guest Priscilla from the same group - both of these gals were on Escaping Polygamy. Amanda\u2019s going to tell us who the Kingstons are, how many mothers she had, and the principle of \u201Cpure Kingston blood\u201D that led to people sometimes intermarrying with relatives - some of whom were underage girls.\nShe\u2019ll tell us about how her 2 years at public school helped her think critically about the differences between what the cult SAID about outsiders and people of color - versus the reality that they were just normal people, how children as young as 9 are sent to work after school, and why the day she left began with a physical altercation with a grown man in the group.\nSee resources below if you\u0027re in need of therapy or support:\n\nhttps://holdingouthelp.org/\u00A0\nhttps://voicesfordignity.com/\u00A0\n\n\nBUY OUR MERCH!! bit.ly/trustmemerch \u00A0\nGot your own story about cults, extreme belief, or abuse of power?

She\u2019ll tell us about her first obsessions about what was and was not sin, how she started to analyze the Bible with a critical mind to try to understand how to avoid hell, and how her parents tried to help but her church leaders didn\u2019t understand OCD and made it worse.\nWe\u2019ll talk about the compulsions she would engage in to make sure she was being the right amount of righteous, how she checked herself into a treatment facility for Christians, the incorrect diagnosis of bulimia she received, and how she finally got diagnosed with moral scrupulosity and began getting the treatment she actually needed.\n\nTrust Me is sponsored by ZocDoc!

They\u2019re going to tell us how they got started writing about 3HO, both interacting with Kundalini yoga in different ways, who Yogi Bhajan was and whether he had any credibility in the Sikh religion (spoiler: he did not), and how he began to get white Americans to believe he was the ultimate spiritual authority, rapidly expanding and profiting off of the money and property of his followers. They\u2019ll tell us about some of the many ways Yogi Bhajan exerted control over his followers lives, the practice of separating children from their parents in a practice called \u201Cdistance therapy,\u201D and the boarding schools kids were sent to for years that turned out to be neglectful and abusive, all within full knowledge and approval of Yogi Bhajan. Plus, the wave of survivors that came forward to tell their stories of his and the organization\u2019s abuse, and how they were failed by 3HO\u2019s reparations program. We have deals for you!

She\u2019ll tell us how some of the friends she made on there convinced her that she was spending too much time on the game, and that she should come live with them in upstate New York... in Crazyland. We\u2019ll talk about how 13 people were living in one trailer, extremely uncomfortable living conditions, but how it fulfilled her desire for a family to take care of (at first). We\u2019ll get into who the leader Ron was, the financial and sexual abuse he was committing, how he isolated her from her parents, and how she finally got out.\n\nEmail Tory to learn more about her story! toryhess037@gmail.com\n\nBUY OUR MERCH!! bit.ly/trustmemerch\u00A0\n\nGot your own story about cults, extreme belief, or abuse of power?

We also compare the similarities of Anne\u0027s experience with that of many cult leaders, how coming out of a paranoid delusion is similar to coming out of a cult belief, and why it can be wise NOT to directly attack the beliefs of someone experiencing a psychotic episode.\n\nTrust Me is brought to you by Shopify!

      "description": "Today our guest is Gareth Gore, journalist and author whose new book Opus is about Opus Dei, an ultra-conservative Catholic sect, its harmful practices, its history of dark money, and its connections to modern day right-wing American politics. Gareth shares how he came to this story while investigating the shady practices at a bank in Spain, the history of the group and the leader\u2019s goals of recruiting elite members of society, and its cultic practices like living in gender segregated homes with a highly controlled life and doing body mortification rituals. He tells about how members would groom kids as young as 11 or 12 to become people of influence in the group, how there are a number of reports of trafficking low-income young women and girls in various countries to exploit their labor at Opus Dei retreats, how some people were fed a cocktail of prescription drugs they didn\u2019t need, and whether there\u2019s been any accountability for these practices\u2014which the group tries to officially distance themselves from. Plus, its ties to prominent US conservative activist Leonard Leo, who\u2019s had an outsized influence in naming three of our current Supreme Court appointees and who\u2019s tied to Project 2025, seeking to \u201Ccrush liberal dominance.\u201D Check out our great sponsors!!

We\u2019ll talk about why it was exciting in the beginning to connect with other women in a new way, how other subgroups began to form (including one secret, exclusive one) and how the admin, who we\u2019ll call Vivian, seemed to be creating a space that prioritized social justice, equality, and helping other people\u2014at first. Norah shares how the culture of the secret smaller group, Girls Night In, began to change, becoming a place where posting nudes was normalized and encouraged, sending them to other people\u2019s boyfriends, and attacking anyone who deviated from Vivian\u2019s ideas about what was good or bad. Plus, red flags that popped up along the way, controversies that made Norah begin to question, and how the group finally collapsed. Trust Me is sponsored by BetterHelp!

She describes the beginning of her spiritual journey including reading the works of Eckhart Tolle, how one specific online guru captured her imagination, and how this guru\u0027s partner made the claim that they were Twin Rays with access to special spiritual knowledge despite their questionable backgrounds. We discuss how they strictly controlled their followers\u0027 diets, made them take a mysterious elixir while on retreats, and how they made their sales pitch to them while they were under the influence.

She will also talk to us about how Arun made her feel special and important, eventually revealing that he was in contact with a series of beings he called \u201Celders\u201D that gave him privileged access to the spiritual realm, some of the ways he began to work his magic on her and why she was the perfect target, and how she felt when he revealed they had been married in another life\u2014and should be married in this one, too.

While Sara\u2019s specialty lies more in optimization of the nonprofit workplace, we\u2019re going to have more of a philosophical discussion about how we\u2019re expected to just trust in our tech overlords without questioning - both the CEOs and the algorithms themselves - how it\u2019s a sort of coercion to be handed algorithms and apps with no say in or understanding of how they work, and how AI factors into all of it. We\u2019ll talk about the difficulty of reining in tech fast enough, how social media is dulling our critical thinking skills, and what she sees as a better approach to tech - and life in general.

She\u2019ll tell us about the backstory leading to this moment in history, who Mao Zedong was and what the country\u0027s climate was like when he began to use propaganda to create a cult of personality around himself, and the movement to \u201Cpurge,\u201D through psychological or violent means, anyone who disagreed with Mao\u2019s policies.\nShe\u2019ll tell us about just how far the fanaticism and propaganda around Chairman Mao went, who the Red Guards were and how they initially seemed just like a cool subculture of young people when she was a kid - until they began to grow more destructive - and why her father was an immediate target.

She\u2019ll talk about how her time trying to save her baby in the children\u2019s hospital, plus working with women doctors and nurses, planted the seeds to help her imagine a world that wasn\u2019t completely run by men. She discusses moving to more heavily patriarchal churches, how the churches may change but it\u2019s all part of the same larger evangelical culture, and how she joined a more extreme and isolated one as her husband became more authoritarian. Plus, she touches on her recovery process, as well as the ongoing and growing danger of fundamentalist Christianity in the United States government.

She\u2019ll tell us about what her sister was like growing up, how she had exhibited Munchausen behaviors from a very young age, making herself seem to be sick before she had children, and how common that and other forms of deception are among people who later develop Munchausen by Proxy. We\u2019ll talk about how her sister faked a pregnancy and miscarriage and how the discovery of that messed with Andrea\u2019s reality, the overlap of characteristics with people who exhibit signs of narcissism and psychopathy, and how actual medical misogyny complicates the whole thing. And next week, we\u2019ll talk about what her sister started doing to her children, what her family tried to do about it, and why they weren\u2019t able to stop her.",

He joins us to talk about Physician Health Programs, (or PHPs) which are under-the-radar programs that most states have. They\u0027re supposed to be a place where doctors who are struggling with substance abuse or mental illness can go to recover. But Wes shares how a shocking number of doctors who do *not* have a substance use disorder are coerced into for-profit inpatient treatment that rips them away from their lives and costs them tens of thousands of dollars of their own money. And if they don\u2019t comply with every demand, they\u2019ll very likely lose their medical licenses. We\u2019ll talk about the benevolent origin of PHPs, the profit motives that corrupted so many them over time, examples of folks who experienced this coercion at the expense of their mental health and career, and how no one believes people who were victims of them - which is why it\u2019s important for people like Wes, who worked for one as a psychiatrist, to speak out. And as always, we will discuss the exceptions, because of course there are people who have been helped by them too. Check out our great sponsors!!

Today we discuss how and when Derek\u2019s identity became exposed to their friend group, including drastically different reactions from fellow students, how they were invited to Shabbat dinner by some Jewish friends, and how over time the cognitive dissonance of believing in ideology that was dangerous to people they care about began to wear on them, eventually leading them to denounce white nationalism.

Derek, who came out as trans in this book, walks us through the white supremacist movement, where it stands now, what it was like growing up in a white nationalist family, being close to prominent neo-Nazi David Duke, how they were taught that the whole world misunderstood their \u0022scientifically correct\u0022 ideology, and speaking to the press and becoming a public-facing figure of racism as a child. They\u2019ll tell us about hosting a white nationalist radio show, going off to college, and how they began hanging out with a Jewish girl there who had no idea about this double life they\u2019d been leading. \n\nCheck out our great sponsors!!\n\nBabbel: Want to learn a new language?

Dr. Feldman discusses why he prefers the term medical child abuse (MCA), some of the more extreme cases he\u0027s seen, red flags he looks out for, and how parents get doctors to believe and treat their children\u0027s fictional illnesses.  Jordyn shares how they were medicated by their mom as a child, receiving surgery and treatments for conditions they never had, how they came to realize they had experienced MCA, and what it was like discovering evidence on their medical records, including learning that one doctor had tried to help.  Plus, can perpetrators be treated? Can it be passed down? What\u0027s the difference between hypochondria and MCA, and what\u0027s the path to recovery for survivors?

Before long, it would make an even bolder claim: It could cure any of your problems. All you had to do was move in. What started in a house on the beach, soon spread to compounds across the country. The man who made the miracle happen, Charles E. Dederich, aka \u201CChuck,\u201D would be the one to destroy it all, along with the lives of many of his followers and millions of dollars in assets. The Sunshine Place tells the mind-blowing, true-story of Synanon - one of America\u2019s most cutting edge social experiments, turned into one of its most dangerous and violent cults - as it\u2019s never been told before: by the people who lived it. Executive Produced by Robert Downey Jr., Susan Downey, and Emily Barclay Ford for Team Downey and C13Originals, together with Josh McLaughlin for Wink Pictures and written, produced, and directed by Peabody-nominated C13Originals, a Cadence13 Studio.",
