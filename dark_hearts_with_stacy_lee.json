      "description": "Detective Ron Goodwyn was concerned when a mysterious man and his small group of cult followers moved into his area. Lou Castro was a man with no verifiable past. The more Ron Goodwyn looked into this group, the more he realized, something was not right. His investigation went nowhere because Lou Castro was not documented anywhere. That\u0027s because Lou Castro was not the leader\u0027s real name. It was Daniel Perez. When cult members begin dying in unusual and frequent accidents, Ron Goodwyn learns that they had had expensive life insurance policies and he begins to form an idea as to how Daniel Perez is funding his lavish lifestyle.\n\n\u2764\uFE0F Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu9SNFGpY_odhZT_LevkGvw\n\uD83D\uDCF8 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/darkheartswithstacylee?igsh=Z2d3bTJtZ2NsNXIy\u0026utm_source=qr\n\uD83C\uDFB5 TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@darkheartswithstacylee?_t=8ns1oHffLyd\u0026_r=1\n\uD83D\uDCB0 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/DarkHeartswithStacyLee?utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator\n\uD83D\uDCB5 CashApp: https://cash.app/$stacyleeDWD\n\uD83E\uDD11 Venmo: \nhttps://www.venmo.com/u/DarkHeartsWithStacyLee\n\uD83D\uDCE7 Email: darkheartswithstacylee@gmail.com\n\nPodcast: Dark Hearts with Stacy Lee is on Apple, Spotify and Amazon",

When Ron and Dan Lafferty declare themselves to be prophets of God, they are excommunicated from the Mormon church and their wives divorce them. The two men decide that their sister in law, Brenda Wright Lafferty, was to blame for their divorces and they target her and the people responsible for their shunning by the Mormon church.

A former Nazi, Paul Sch\u00E4fer cozies up to the Chilean dictator, Jorge Alessandri Rodriguez and together, they form a devious plan. Paul Sch\u00E4fer is gifted a large plot of land and he begins moving his German cult followers to Chile. Soon, he has constructed a compound and people are no longer free to leave. Stories of abuse and child sexual abuse begin coming out of the cult but because of Sch\u00E4fer\u0027s connections, nothing is done about it. A new dictator is put in place and things get much worse. Working with DINA in Chile, illegally held prisoners are kept at Colonia Dignidad and some are murdered. Over time, eleven hundred people go missing and are murdered at the cult compound. The families of cult members are demanding justice but it takes far too long for action.\n\n\u2764\uFE0F Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu9SNFGpY_odhZT_LevkGvw\n\uD83D\uDCF8 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/darkheartswithstacylee?igsh=Z2d3bTJtZ2NsNXIy\u0026utm_source=qr\n\uD83C\uDFB5 TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@darkheartswithstacylee?_t=8ns1oHffLyd\u0026_r=1\n\uD83D\uDCB0 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/DarkHeartswithStacyLee?utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator\n\uD83D\uDCB5 CashApp: https://cash.app/$stacyleeDWD\n\uD83E\uDD11 Venmo: \nhttps://www.venmo.com/u/DarkHeartsWithStacyLee\n\uD83D\uDCE7 Email: darkheartswithstacylee@gmail.com\n\nPodcasts Dark Hearts with Stacy Lee, Dining With Death, and 15 Minute Mysteries are on Apple, Spotify and Amazon.",

Klara Mauerova and Katerina Mauerova have Klara\u0027s son Ondrej locked in the basement, where he has been for months. Just when this story cannot get any stranger, it does. Klara is the adoptive mother to a girl named Annika, who she claims is thirteen years old and suffering from leukemia. Annika is not who she appears to be and when she escapes, the police go on a year long manhunt to find this imposter. The two women are aided by Hana Bosova, Jan Scria and Jan Turek and you will simply not believe what these monsters are involved in.\n\n\n\u2764\uFE0F Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu9SNFGpY_odhZT_LevkGvw\n\uD83D\uDCF8 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/darkheartswithstacylee?igsh=Z2d3bTJtZ2NsNXIy\u0026utm_source=qr\n\uD83C\uDFB5 TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@darkheartswithstacylee?_t=8ns1oHffLyd\u0026_r=1\n\uD83D\uDCB0 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/DarkHeartswithStacyLee?utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator\n\uD83D\uDCB5 CashApp: https://cash.app/$stacyleeDWD\n\uD83E\uDD11 Venmo: \nhttps://www.venmo.com/u/DarkHeartsWithStacyLee\n\uD83D\uDCE7 Email: darkheartswithstacylee@gmail.com\n\nPodcasts Dark Hearts with Stacy Lee, Dining With Death, and 15 Minute Mysteries are on Apple, Spotify and Amazon.",

The religion was, in fact, made up by Yogi Bhajan, Harbhajan Singh Khalsa who was once respected and even honored at the White House. Then, women began coming forward with horrific stories of psychological, physical and sexual abuse. Katie Griggs, Kundalini Katie, Guru Jagat then becomes the face of the Millennial Girl Boss yoga movement. She has tried to become famous through many means and finally, she is. She becomes radicalized by QAnon theories and right wing conspiracies. She is single handedly responsible for a lot of the new age to right wing conspiracy pipeline phenomenon we have witnessed. Guru Jagat creates a clothing line called Robotic Disaster and begins making a lot of money selling clothing and crystals and tonics. Behind closed doors, she is a tyrant who verbally abuses her employees and refuses to pay them what is owed. She breaks her ankle in Germany and suddenly, her empire comes crashing down \u2764\uFE0F Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu9SNFGpY_odhZT_LevkGvw \u0026#x1f4f8; Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/darkheartswithstacylee?igsh=Z2d3bTJtZ2NsNXIy\u0026utm_source=qr \u0026#x1f3b5; TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@darkheartswithstacylee?_t=8ns1oHffLyd\u0026_r=1 \u0026#x1f4b0; Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/DarkHeartswithStacyLee?utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator \u0026#x1f4b5; CashApp: https://cash.app/$stacyleeDWD \u0026#x1f911; Venmo: https://www.venmo.com/u/DarkHeartsWithStacyLee \u0026#x1f4e7; Email: darkheartswithstacylee@gmail.com",

A man named Buffalo Bill Hawkins and his brother JG change their names to Yisrayl and Yaaqob and state that they are The Two Witnesses prophesied in the Book of Revelations. They gather a small following and before long, as in all cults, everything gets dark. Children are horrifically abused. Women are treated like cattle. Fire and brimstone reign down from Yisrayll\u0027s pulpit and he begins making predictions about the end of the world. He steals money, he starves his followers, he abuses everyone involved and then the authorities get involved.

After his death, a woman named Katie Griggs rose to take his place at the helm of this rich and powerful cult, owner of 3HO Corporation and all it\u0027s subsidiaries as well as the Ra Ma Institute. Katie claims to have had a very special relationship with Yogi Bhajan. Now it appears she never even met the man. Allegations come out in 2019 that forever changes the way the world will remember Yogi Bhajan. Guru Jagat, formerly Katie Griggs, denied the allegations and continued to build the massive corporation, spending money like there was a never ending supply. She fell down the hole of conspiracy theories, QAnon, Covid denial, and is largely responsible for the New Age to Right Wing pipeline phenomena we have witnessed.

We talk about how the cult grew in Hollywood after Jaime failed to make it as an actor, and then moved to Austin where it built the One World Theater, now owned by Joe Rogan, to produce ballets. Jaime Gomez put his cult members through two years of practice for a ballet that was never seen by anyone. The members of this cult worshipped Jaime. They gave him massages all day. They cooked his meals. They bought his food. They paid his expenses. But then, when it got out that Jaime was having sex with the male members, and abusing others, it all started to fall apart. Then the documentary, Holy Hell came out and it was all downhill from there.\n\n\u2764\uFE0F Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu9SNFGpY_odhZT_LevkGvw\n\uD83D\uDCF8 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/darkheartswithstacylee?igsh=Z2d3bTJtZ2NsNXIy\u0026utm_source=qr\n\uD83C\uDFB5 TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@darkheartswithstacylee?_t=8ns1oHffLyd\u0026_r=1\n\uD83D\uDCB0 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/DarkHeartswithStacyLee?utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator\n\uD83D\uDCB5 CashApp: https://cash.app/$stacyleeDWD\n\uD83E\uDD11 Venmo: \nhttps://www.venmo.com/u/DarkHeartsWithStacyLee\n\uD83D\uDCE7 Email: darkheartswithstacylee@gmail.com",

      "description": "You\u0027ve seen the posters advertising for Shen Yun Dance, a traveling Chinese dance troupe that comes to your town every so often. But did you know, Shen Yun is part of a very dangerous and insidious cult called Falun Gong? This cult deprives people of their freedom, their money, their personal possessions, and their individuality. It makes millions each year on the Shen Yun shows, the dancers in which are basically slaves. Falun Gong is also involved in a massive propaganda effort for the extreme right wing that includes the media outlet, The Epoch Times. Join me for this disturbing tale that reminds us, things that look beautiful from the outside are often hiding something very sinister inside.

Sean Moon, (Hyung Jin Sean Moon) son of Sun Myung Moon, founder of the cult commonly known as The Moonies, has started his own cult and it\u0027s even crazier than The Moonies. Sean believes The Rod of Iron mentioned in the Bible is not the word of god, or a metaphor for holding fast to the rod in order to return to heaven. Sean believes The Rod of Iron mentioned in the Bible is an actual AR-15. This cult is not just obsessed with guns, it actually worships guns. The cult is dangerous and its members are unhinged. This cult is homophobic, misogynistic, transphobic and anti-Constitution. It\u0027s also ridiculous and hilarious...well at least it would be if it weren\u0027t so scary.\n\n\u2764\uFE0F Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu9SNFGpY_odhZT_LevkGvw\n\uD83D\uDCF8 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/darkheartswithstacylee?igsh=Z2d3bTJtZ2NsNXIy\u0026utm_source=qr\n\uD83C\uDFB5 TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@darkheartswithstacylee?_t=8ns1oHffLyd\u0026_r=1\n\uD83D\uDCB0 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/DarkHeartswithStacyLee?utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator\n\uD83D\uDCB5 CashApp: https://cash.app/$stacyleeDWD\n\uD83E\uDD11 Venmo: \nhttps://www.venmo.com/u/DarkHeartsWithStacyLee\n\uD83D\uDCE7 Email: darkheartswithstacylee@gmail.com",

Samuel Shaffer and John Alvin Coltharp take their children, two boys and four girls under the age of eight and hide them from the law and their mothers. When the cops finally catch up to them, they almost cannot believe the stories the children have to tell but they must because they are all true. The level of abuse is unthinkable and the level of delusion is disturbing. What leads to this kind of paranoia and mental instability? My opinion might surprise you.

Taylor is a charlatan and conman who is bilking the faithful for millions of dollars to fund his lavish lifestyle and pay for all the gifts he gives his many girlfriends. There are accusations of slave labor inside the \u0022church\u0022 called JMMI and the \u0022church\u0022 called KOGGC. David E. Taylor makes wild claims that he can heal the sick, bring sight to the blind, give hearing to the deaf, make the disabled walk and that he can even raise the dead! He claims to be able to time travel and he says he has face to face meetings with Jesus on a regular basis. Many people have been conned and lost up to a million dollars for following this evil man and we need to get the word out about him. When I tell you these sermons are otherworldly?

This Video Created by dark hearts with stacey lee YouTube Channel. #breakingnews #elizabeth #crime_news \n\nToday we are doing a deep dive on someone who was once in the news every single day. We are talking about Brian David Mitchell, who first changed his name to Daveed and then to Immanuel. He is, of course, the man who kidnapped Elizabeth Smart but we aren\u0027t talking about that event today, as much as we are talking about what made Brian David Mitchell do what he did, and we are talking about the uptick in men who think like he does. There is a frightening and disturbing trend happening on social media right now, the trend of \u0022Trad Wives\u0022 and the men who love them...women who believe they are subservient to men and the men who demand servitude and subservience from those women. This is a trend that should disturb anyone with two brain cells and for that reason, it is important to discuss these stories to remind people what happens when men like this do what they want to do.\n\nFollow me on TT, on IG, and please like and subscribe.

The problem is, there is no proof that any child was ever rescued, or any woman for that matter. \nNow, Tim has been denounced by the Mormon church, and is embroiled in scandal as woman after woman comes forward accusing Tim of sexually assaulting him as they worked for him.

We discuss it\u0027s founders, Gene and Marsha Spriggs, and the allegations against the cult: child abuse, psychological abuse, labor law violations and physical abuse. We talk about the cult migration from Chattanooga, Tennessee to Vermont and then back to Chattanooga and we talk about the Yellow Deli history and current status. These are my opinions and thoughts.

      "description": "We discuss the recent disturbing story of Spring Thibaudeau, a Mormon woman who has very extreme and fringe beliefs, including a belief that her son Blaze is a Davidic Servant, tasked with ushering in the apocalypse and the second coming of Jesus Christ. I give you an overview of where these beliefs come from, from my perspective as an ex-Mormon. We talk about why this seems to be happening more and more and we discuss the events of this crime. Spring, her brother Brooke Hale, and her daughter Abigail Thibaudeau Snarr are convinced the world as we know it is ending in November 2023 and they believe that Blaze, a 16 year old boy from Arizona, is a divinely chosen player in the coming apocalypse. I give you the details of the story and bring you up to date as we wait for more details.\n\n\u2764\uFE0FSubscribe: https://youtube.com/channel/UCu9SNFGpY_odhZT_LevkGvw\n\uD83D\uDC27 Twitter: http://twitter.com/diningwithdeath\n\uD83D\uDCF8 Instagram: http://instagram.com/diningwithdeath\n\uD83D\uDE46\u200D\u2640\uFE0F Facebook: http://facebook.com/diningwithdeath\n\uD83D\uDCB0 Patreon https://www.patreon.com/DiningWithDeath\n\uD83C\uDFB5TikTok https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM8HkTANw/\n\uD83D\uDCB2 CashApp $stacyleeDWD\n\uD83D\uDCB0 Venmo @DiningWithDeath",

Satanic Panic has been dragged into 2023 and this self proclaimed guru is leading the charge. Teal Swan, raised in Utah, claims to be the victim of horrific satanic abuse. The problem is? Everyone who knows her claims it\u0027s all a lie. We discuss her slow rise to new age fame, her outlandish stories, and why she is so dangerous. Don\u0027t watch if you don\u0027t want my opinions.

We trace the cult\u0027s path through Canada into Ontario and we talk about Roch\u0027s ever changing and increasingly disturbing beliefs regarding sex, anatomy, health and the apocalypse. The cult, which came to be known as The Ant Hill Kids, was eventually disbanded after many years of hard work and we discuss what eventually happened to it\u0027s sick and twisted leader, Roch Th\u00E9riault and the film that was made about these events, Savage Messiah.\n\n\u2764\uFE0FSubscribe: https://youtube.com/channel/UCu9SNFGpY_odhZT_LevkGvw\n\uD83D\uDC27 Twitter: http://twitter.com/diningwithdeath\n\uD83D\uDCF8 Instagram: http://instagram.com/diningwithdeath\n\uD83D\uDE46\u200D\u2640\uFE0F Facebook: http://facebook.com/diningwithdeath\n\uD83D\uDCB0 Patreon https://www.patreon.com/DiningWithDeath\n\uD83C\uDFB5TikTok https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM8HkTANw/\n\uD83D\uDCB2 CashApp $stacyleeDWD\n\uD83D\uDCB0 Venmo @DiningWithDeath",

We talk about how he and his small group of followers banded together in their apocalyptic beliefs and what ultimately became of them. David Immanuel took the easy way out, leaving his wife Rachel to raise their seven children. When she decided she could not do that, she forced them off of the roof of the Shilo Inn in Salt Lake City Utah. Some of the older children jumped to their deaths. This group is sometimes called The Cult of David Immanuel or The Cult of David.\n\n\u2764\uFE0FSubscribe: https://youtube.com/channel/UCu9SNFGpY_odhZT_LevkGvw\n\uD83D\uDC27 Twitter: http://twitter.com/diningwithdeath\n\uD83D\uDCF8 Instagram: http://instagram.com/diningwithdeath\n\uD83D\uDE46\u200D\u2640\uFE0F Facebook: http://facebook.com/diningwithdeath\n\uD83D\uDCB0 Patreon https://www.patreon.com/DiningWithDeath\n\uD83C\uDFB5TikTok https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM8HkTANw/\n\uD83D\uDCB2 CashApp $stacyleeDWD\n\uD83D\uDCB0 Venmo @DiningWithDeath",
