      "description": "Ruby Franke\u2019s eldest daughter, Shari Franke, is speaking out for the first time about the alleged abuse she claims her mom inflicted on her as a child. She told her side of the story in her memoir, \u201CThe House Of My Mother: A Daughter\u2019s Quest For Freedom\u201D and stopped by \u201CGood Morning America\u201D on Jan. 7, to discuss some of the alleged abuse. \u0022When I was younger, around, like, five-six, Ruby was really physical,\u201D she said. \u201CWhether it was like a slap to the lip or-- a slap to the cheek\u2026when I would practice the piano, her hand would slam and it was really scary. And honestly, when she met Jodi [Hildebrandt], that kind of stopped.\u0022 Jodi Hildebrandt was a Mormon family counselor and mentor to Ruby. Shari told \u201CGMA\u201D she felt a shift when Jodi came into the picture. Ruby is a former YouTuber who rose to fame by sharing videos of her family life in Utah, even offering parenting advice, that was sometimes controversial. In August 2023 she was arrested along Jodi after authorities found an emaciated and malnourished juvenile with open wounds and duct tape on their extremities. That December, the former vlogger pleaded guilty to four counts of child abuse.\n\n0:00 - Introduction of Shari Franke\n0:36 - Childhood Experiences and Allegations\n1:20 - Impact of Jodi Hildebrandt\u0027s Influence\n2:05 - Context of Ruby Franke\u0027s Arrest\n3:13 - Conclusion and Reflection\n\n\u00BB SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiKGMZZmZXK-RpbKJGXgH3Q?sub_confirmation=1\n\u00BB Visit Our Website: http://accessonline.com\n\nGet More Access :\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/accesshollywood/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/accesshollywood\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/accesshollywood/\n\n#AccessHollywood\n\n\u0022Access Hollywood\u0022 is an entertainment news show featuring Mario Lopez, Kit Hoover, Scott Evans, and correspondent Zuri Hall.

People just like to put labels and categories on everyone and so that was a big part of it just feeling like I don\u0027t know how to talk about this where I feel like I\u0027ll be really understood and I was kind of terrified of being misunderstood.\u0022 Bethany also talked about her new single \u0022Strawberries\u0022 and revealed the inspiration behind the track, which is available to stream Aug. 18.",
