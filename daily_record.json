      "description": "A former priest who was the leader of evangelical movement the Nine O\u2019Clock Service has been found guilty of sexual offences against nine women.\n\nChristopher Brain, 68, from Wilmslow, Cheshire, was the leader of the Nine O\u2019Clock Service (NOS), part of the Church of England, in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, between 1986 and 1995.\n\nHe was found guilty by a jury at Inner London Crown Court on Wednesday of 17 counts of indecent assault during the years he led the movement.\n\nThe jury cleared him of 15 counts of indecent assault and are still deliberating on four counts of indecent assault and one of rape.\n\nBrain appeared unmoved in the dock as the verdicts were read out.\n\nProsecutors previously told jurors that the NOS group was aimed at younger people and \u201Cpresented itself to the outside world as a progressive force for good\u201D.\n\nThey said NOS became a cult in which Brain abused his position to exert control over the lives of his female followers and ostracised them from friends and family.\n\nBrain rejected evidence from alleged victims that he had tried to control people by making them wear the same clothing or lose weight, or that he discouraged them from maintaining friendships.\n\nJurors will return to court at 10am on Thursday to continue deliberations.\n\nDaily Record Homepage:  https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/\n\nDaily Record Facebook: https://facebook.com/TheScottishDailyRecord\nDaily Record Instagram: https://instagram.com/scottishdailyrecord\nDaily Record Sport Instagram: https://instagram.com/dailyrecord_sport\nDaily Record TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@scottishdailyrecord\nDaily Record Sport TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dailyrecord_sport\nDaily Record Twitter: https://twitter.com/Daily_Record\nDaily Record Newsletters: https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/newsletter-preference-centre/\n\nJoin our WhatsApp communities here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages:\n\nDAILY RECORD: https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/join-daily-records-whatsapp-community-31116469\n\nYou can get all the latest news, sport, showbiz and comment at DailyRecord.co.uk\n\nLIKE | COMMENT | SUBSCRIBE | SHARE\n#DailyRecord #nineoclockservice #court #priest",
