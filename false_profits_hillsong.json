      "description": "In the final episode of False Profits, Noemi asks \u201Chas Hillsong changed?\u201D And is it ready to talk to people like Noemi and listen to their stories? We put our questions to the church. And Noemi enlists the advice of a leading lawyer specialising in abuse. Campaigner Ashley Easter gives advice on how to advocate for victims. And cult survivor Dr Steven Hassan explains how all of us can become better critics of religious groups. Noemi and Elle meet up again and Elle shares the inside track on Hillsong. There are some big changes and the church is keen to move on from the Brian Houston era. But will it address the issues raised in the series? And Noemi heads to Pride New York to take back control and explains why she is not quite done with Hillsong yet.

Janice Lagata, Tiffany Perez and Noemi meet up in New York - where a culture of exploitation and abuse went unchecked. Noemi, Janice and Tiffany explore the bond that has formed among people who\u2019ve left the church and they jump into the issue of race. They say it\u2019s women of colour who are some of the loudest critical voices because \u201CHillsong never thought we would speak out, because they never saw us\u201D. The trio used podcasts and social media to ask awkward questions and call out those in power. They explore what justice looks like and wonder whether the best form of revenge could simply be finding happiness outside Hillsong?

And finally it was time to share that queer identity with family and church. But Noemi doesn\u2019t get affirmation and struggles to get answers from Hillsong. Does the church welcome gay people?

In this episode we go back to Hillsong\u2019s roots and the man who built a mega church - Brian Houston - aka \u2018The Big Eagle\u2019. For many years Brian Houston, his wife Bobbie and their kids were the Hillsong powerbase. But in March 2022 Brian steps down as leader. As the power structure crumbles, Elle Hardy heads to Sydney to explore the rise and fall of \u2018House of Houston\u2019. During the episode a bombshell drops: a whistleblower makes a series of claims about the church finances. Hillsong denies any wrong doing. But Elle finds Hillsong and its followers dealing with wave after wave of scandal. Thanks to Australian Broadcasting Corporation Library Sales for use of ABC news archive.
