      "description": "Oric Bovar gained a huge following throughout the 60\u0027s as a mail-order astrologer, and as he began claiming wild ideas and making tragic predictions, many of his followers stuck with him\u2014followers who happened to be high-caliber actors and artists, including Terence Stamp and Bernadette Peters. \n\nTod Jackson was his right-hand-man through much of Oric\u2019s ascent, and in his old age, Tod looks back in order to take us through the mental and emotional processes that culminated in an unfortunate series of death and loss. As Tod, still healing from these events, takes us through the journey of those days past, we also witness the journey of a man letting go of one of his closest friends.\n\n#Frameworks #Documentary #OricBovar\n--\nThis video is from BRIC TV\u2014 the first 24/7 television channel created by, for, and about Brooklyn.
