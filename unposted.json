Educate yourself and spread the word. Thank you. On today\u0027s episode our host Liz Bezler takes time to talk about the harsh realities of becoming a professional dancer and how her once glamorized dream is not anything like she thought it would be. Liz will talk about what it takes to become a professional dancer, her experience getting an agent and auditioning for big name brands and artists, not feeling valued on gigs, and how life is not linear. She reminds us that it is okay for our dreams to change and for doors to close that we once thought were what we wanted. Life is a roller coaster\u2026 and it\u2019s all a part of the journey.
