      "description": "As fitness studios exploded across Indian cities after the Covid pandemic, Cult.fit rose to prominence on the back of its fun, accessible classes that appealed to sedentary urbanites. Meanwhile, doctors noticed a sharp rise in workout-related injuries. Majority of those injured fell in the \u0022most vulnerable\u0022 35-45 age bracket. What\u0027s going on? The Ken reporter DVLS Pranathi explains. Tune in. Question for listeners: Whose responsibility is it to make sure you don\u2019t suffer from any injuries when you start your fitness journey? Is it yours or Cult\u0027s? Or do you think it\u0027s both? You can send in your answers to our Whatsapp number 8971108379. Also if you have any questions for Pranathi, you can send them on the same number as a voice note or a text message.
