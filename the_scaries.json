      "description": "WE\u0027RE BAAAAAACK!!!! Welcome to the dark, twisted world of cults, where manipulation is sold as salvation, and women, in particular, pay the price. In this week\u2019s episode of The Scaries, we investigate why women have historically been drawn into cults\u2014only to find themselves trapped in cycles of coercion, control, and, in some cases, outright abuse. Spoiler alert: this isn\u2019t just a thing of the past. From The Manson Family and Jonestown to the rise of \u201CTrad Wives\u201D and influencer-led digital cults, the tactics remain the same, just with a modern, Instagram-friendly twist. Why are women particularly vulnerable? And how can we spot the warning signs before it\u2019s too late? Tune in for the dark truth, some well-earned side-eye, and the tools to fight back. Because real empowerment never comes at the cost of your autonomy. Follow us on Instagram @raiseherco and @scaries.podcast and on TikTok @raiseherco.
