      "description": "I\u0027ve decided to upload a series of videos that relate to Scientology\u0027s mistreatment of children and young adults.  I\u0027ve chosen to focus on Wally Hanks because he is an easily accessible example of these types of crimes and the churches refusal to deal with these issues and possible encouragement of abusive behavior.  Wally Hanks was an upper level Scientologist who owned/ran The Mace Kingsley Ranch (made famous by Jenna Miscavige).  Because of his OT status Scientology covered up his activities.  When his activities could no longer be swept under the rug he was quietly processed out of the church.  The church decided to quietly oust him rather than publicly declaring him Suppressive and pressing charges because it would be bad public relations for such a high level member to be associated with these types of actions.\n\nThis particular video is a supposed interview with Wally Hanks.  In this part Wally Talks about \u0022Marco\u0022 (the boy in the famous audio recording of an actual beating given by Wally himself). I have no way of verifying its authenticity.  The interviewer removes his own voice with slides of what he was supposedly asking.  The video leaves a lot to be desired as far as credibility goes.  HOWEVER, I choose to believe it is LEGITIMATE.  \n\nFor more videos in this series check out the links below\nhttp://youtu.be/Vt1k65htRxI\nhttp://youtu.be/aoyOZJ_bvng\nhttp://youtu.be/m37MX5sDmXw\nhttp://youtu.be/jJQlyFFUz4U\nhttp://youtu.be/aYlCXSwcwXk\n\nThis video is uploaded with the intent of educating the public regarding Scientology and its belief structure.

Laugh if you want, but there is A LOT of controversy surrounding this film.  Between Scientology\u0027s hatred for it and all the legal s*it surrounding it I was literally losing sleep because I was afraid that either OSA would park outside my house or my channel would get shut down over it.  So as a comprise with myself I have posted this teaser and provided a link to a brave souls channel who has the whole thing up.  Check out the whole film at the link below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=063NOXxxb6s\n\n\n\nThe Profit is the video Scientology doesn\u0027t want you to see.  They actually had it banned from distribution in the United States for awhile.  It is an excellent dramatization with clear parallels to Scientology.  Of course it comes with the standard film disclaimer about any similarities to actual events or persons being purely coincidental *wink* .  I especially like this film over other Scientology related drama/fiction because it embraces the John Parsons / L Ron Hubbard connection as well as touching on the occult foundations of Scientology.  \nI HIGHLY encourage you all to watch this film.  I\u0027ll take The Profit over The Master any day.  \n\n\nCheck out the links below for more details...\n\nhttp://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/TheProfit/\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Profit\n\nhttp://weblog.sinteur.com/index.php/2008/03/22/anonymous-delivers-the-profit/\n\nThis video is uploaded with the intent of educating the public regarding Scientology and its belief structure.

      "description": "This video is perhaps one of the best deprogramming tools that I have found.  It features a Class 8 auditor named Aida Thomas and an interviewer whose name I can\u0027t remember at the moment.  Aida left the church of Scientology at some point and joined The FreeZone.  This video was originally presented in 7 parts but I edited it together into one single video because I personally HATE flipping through a bunch of short segments...I am king of the \u0022Play All\u0022 feature on DVDS...LOL.  \n\nIn the video Aida points out several alterations to LRH Tech (and provides documentation) that were made after L Ron Hubbard died....or \u0022dropped his body\u0022..depending on what side of the issue you are on.  I feel that it is important to mention that I am NOT a fan of Hubbard Tech...I am actually vehemently opposed to it.  However, I believe that the first step in deprogramming a Scio is to show the flaws in CoS itself rather than attacking the Tech.\n\nI give full credit for this video to Aida Thomas and highly encourage you to visit her channel and perhaps even subscribe to it.  She also has some very interesting videos where she and a group of FreeZone Scios visit Golden Era Productions and other CoS locations and are told to leave.  It\u0027s fun watching them spit Tech at each other!\n\nYou can visit her channel here:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UCymDiRFAp5BmfusZnkwT7mA\n\n\n\n\nThis video is uploaded with the intent of educating the public regarding Scientology and its belief structure.

      "title": "Steven Fishman Deposition Full Version",
      "description": "This is the famous \u0022Fishman\u0022 deposition as a whole instead of being broken into parts.  Mr. Fishman had one of the largest privately held collections of material by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard.  Despite Mr. Fishman\u0027s idiosyncrasies and his disputed level of involvement in the Church of Scientology, I believe that his descriptions of Scientology\u0027s Cosmology and general belief structure are a fair representation of some of the more arcane and esoteric teachings of the \u0022religion\u0022.  His insights are an invaluable peek into what is essentially a modern mystery religion.   His explanation of the \u0022between lives area\u0022 and the nature of reincarnation as understood by Scientology are both unique and rarely expounded on in this depth.  Considering his extensive library and obvious zeal for the topic I think his insights into the belief structure are both important and valid.  A rare treat in a subject where so few \u0022true believers\u0022 are willing to discuss their beliefs.  Keep in mind that some of the subject matter involves Mr. Fishman\u0027s personal \u0022whole track\u0022 and is relevant only to him and not Scientology in general.\nSay what you will about Mr. Fishman but, always remember that much of what we know about Scientology\u0027s beliefs were exposed by the various legal cases involving him. For bringing all this info to light we owe him a debt of gratitude.  You can find out more about him by checking out the following sites: \n\nhttp://fishman.home.xs4all.nl/  \n\nwww.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Fishman/\n\nhttp://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Fishman/Declaration/\n\nhttp://www.xenu-directory.net/critics/fishman1.html\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Fishman\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishman_Affidavit\n\nThen you can check out some of Scientology\u0027s responses to the Issue of Mr. Fishman at these sites:\n\nhttp://www.theta.com/fishman/\n\nhttp://www.religiousfreedomwatch.org/anti-religious-extremists/steven-fishman/",
