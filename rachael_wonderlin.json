      "description": "WOW. We had so much fun interviewing Anna about her experience in #DevilCorp that we knew we had to do it again! Before tuning into Part Two, check out Part One.\n\nShortly after graduating college, Anna was offered a job with a \u0022marketing company\u0022 who promised that, if she worked hard enough, she could one day become a BUSINESS OWNER!\n\nShoutout to Sarah Edmondson, whose book, SCARRED, I couldn\u0027t put down. Also, rest in peace, Mike Rinder, famous ex-Scientologist. Thank you both for the hard work you\u0027ve done getting people out of cults!\n\nAs you may have guessed, that didn\u0027t exactly pan out. Join us as we hear more about Anna\u0027s wild ride.",

There were four of us, sleeping on air mattresses, in a one-bedroom apartment.\u0022\n\nJoin us as we talk to Anna Faila about her experience in a business cult, \u0022DevilCorp,\u0022 (real name changed, of course) during her early 20s. When Anna and I first started talking about entrepreneurship, I had no idea that our discussion would lead here, but I knew immediately we needed to bring her on the podcast.\n\nThis was the wildest interview we\u0027ve done yet and we loved it so much, we\u0027re bringing Anna back for a second one!\u00A0\n\n#entrepreneurship #scam #scammer #business #cults #devilcorp",
