      "description": "The Republican-led House Oversight Committee says it will move to hold Bill Clinton in contempt of Congress after he refused to appear for a scheduled deposition tied to the Epstein probe. Oversight Chair James Comer accuses Clinton\u2019s legal team of months of delays and defiance of what he calls a lawful subpoena. The committee had also subpoenaed Hillary Clinton, with House Speaker Mike Johnson warning that skipping testimony could trigger contempt proceedings. In a sharply worded response, the Clintons argue the subpoenas are legally invalid, unconstitutional, and an unprecedented overreach by Congress. They deny any wrongdoing and say they are prepared to fight the matter in court. Photos released by the committee show Bill Clinton alongside Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell in the early 2000s. Clinton has acknowledged flying on Epstein\u2019s plane for foundation-related travel before Epstein faced criminal charges, but insists he was unaware of Epstein\u2019s crimes and cut ties years before Epstein\u2019s 2006 arrest.\n\n#BillClinton #EpsteinFiles #EpsteinInvestigation #HouseOversight #JamesComer #ContemptOfCongress #ClintonSubpoena #EpsteinCase #GhislaineMaxwell #CongressionalProbe #WashingtonPolitics #DOJEpsteinFiles #PoliticalAccountability #USCongressNews #PowerAndAccountability\n\nTimes Of India (TOI) Is The Largest Selling English Daily In The World. \n\nTimes Of India Videos Bring You Global News, Views And Sharp Analysis.

An FBI tip from 2020 describes allegations that Epstein filmed compromising material across multiple states and on private jets, possibly using recordings as leverage. Court records also reference an \u201CAdult Video Club\u201D rental agreement for video tapes and equipment, echoing long-standing suspicions about hidden recordings.

      "description": "A fresh release of Jeffrey Epstein documents has reignited scrutiny around President Donald Trump \u2014 but also triggered an unusually forceful response from the Justice Department. Newly disclosed FBI records detail a pre-election phone call alleging sexual assault involving Trump and Epstein, claims the DOJ says are \u201Cunfounded and false.\u201D Within hours of the documents becoming public, the FBI file containing the allegation was quietly removed from the DOJ\u2019s Epstein database. At the same time, internal Justice Department emails revealed that Trump flew on Epstein\u2019s private jet more times than previously known \u2014 information prosecutors described as \u201Csituational awareness,\u201D not evidence of wrongdoing. As nearly 30,000 pages of Epstein-related files flood the public domain, the case underscores a familiar tension in Washington: transparency versus proof, allegation versus evidence \u2014 and why some names continue to dominate the fallout from Epstein\u2019s shadowy past.\n\n#EpsteinFiles #TrumpDOJ #JusticeDepartment #FBIRecords #EpsteinInvestigation\n#PoliticalFirestorm #WashingtonPolitics #TransparencyDebate #PowerAndAccountability\n\nTimes Of India (TOI) Is The Largest Selling English Daily In The World. \n\nTimes Of India Videos Bring You Global News, Views And Sharp Analysis.
