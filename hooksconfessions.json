      "description": "You\u2019re not alone. In this video, I\u0027ll share my terrible experience with abuse by my psychologist. I went to therapy for child abuse and unfortunately my doctor was an actual psychopath. Narcissistic abuse in therapy by psychologists and therapists is far more common than most realize. Sadly, patients and victims are often confused and ashamed and reluctant to file reports.\n\nI suffered seizures, brain fog, memory loss, panic attacks, horrible depression. It destroyed my marriage and caused irreparable damage to many people I love most.\n\n\u2728ABOUT ME \u2728\nHey, I\u0027m Carolyn - a photographer, actor, a survivor of therapy abuse, a mom on the spectrum (AuDHD), a filmmaker, and crochet lover; creating a soft, real space for anyone healing or feeling overwhelmed by the noise of the patriarchy.
