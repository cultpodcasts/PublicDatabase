      "description": "When you think of a cult, you may picture one of the infamous ones. But in actuality, cults are able to hide themselves and operate in a much more insidious manner. Education and communication are two key components for keeping ourselves and our loved ones safe from the harmful influences of cults, so what do we need to watch out for? Executive Director of the Cult Education Institute Rick Alan Ross explains how cults are defined, why they can be destructive, and how people involved can be deprogrammed. Later, he looks back at some of the more memorable cases on which he\u0027s been involved.
