Do you think they are really appointed by Holy Spirit, considering CSA cases like those in Pennsylvania?\n\n\nWomen in the organization are counseled on lots of things, take make-up, and how you dress for instance. What are Jehovah\u0027s Witness men counseled on about things they do or say, or what they wear?\n\n\nHow many people do you really think are actively in the JW religion?\n\n\nWhat do you think was the real reason for the \u0022new light\u0022 about toasting/clinking glasses?\n\n\nHow long have you cursed? Did you just start after you walked away from that religion?\n\n\nI hope you enjoy this as much as I did!\n\n\n#EXJW #ex-JehovahsWitness #JW #jworg\n\n\nSupport the show (https://www.buzzsprout.com/2514763/support)",

Although it may hurt family and friends still in that organization, I have to stay true to myself. My number ONE reason for leaving is the organization\u0027s choice to hide and protect accused sexual predators within their organization in congregations around the world, not alerting the proper authorities on who they are, or what they have done. Instead, victims are shamed and silenced.\n\nI ask you to consider facts, and decide for yourself. My mission is to expose the false prophets at the world headquarters in New York, USA. The more people that are made aware of these horrible actions taking place, the sooner we can bring justice to the deserving victims.
