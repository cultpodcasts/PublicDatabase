We shared very similar upbringings in the Jehovah\u0027s Witness organization. Born and raised in it, an all-in mentality, moved up the ranks, and had numerous \u0022privileges\u0022 (duties) while in.\n\n\nGradually things made him rethink his life in that organization, specifically a very huge bombshell that woke him up totally. Chris is fortunate to have had his spouse wake up as well. Chris does something different, and actually asks me a question, which in turn got me a little emotional. I hope that you enjoy this thought provoking episode!\n\n\nSupport the show (https://www.buzzsprout.com/2514763/support)",

      "description": "Send me a text (https://www.buzzsprout.com/twilio/text_messages/2514763/open_sms) \n\n\nThis is a very special episode for me. I have mentioned in various videos the Jehovah\u0027s Witness involvement and treatment of CSA victims. In this episode my very special guest, Jared sheds light on this sensitive subject. Like me, Jared was born and raised in the religion. After baptism Jared moved through the ranks, and eventually became an elder. Get an inside look into the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses world of how they deal with CSA within their organization.\n\n\nJared also speaks about the religion\u0027s practice of shunning members, and the results that come from it. It\u0027s not all doom and gloom however. Jared gives great advice about life after leaving the organization, how to begin healing, and how to thrive in life. I truly hope you find value in this important episode.\n\n\n***During the episode Jared mentions two books that he wrote. Here are the links here:\n\n\n1) Burn The Scorecard:\u00A0 https://a.co/d/6JsSLnp\n\n\n2) Authentic Leadership - What Really Works: https://a.co/d/7ub1xzY\n\n\nSupport the show (https://www.buzzsprout.com/2514763/support)",

As I began my deconstruction I slowly began watching different EXJW\u0027s videos and listening to their stories. After being in the Jehovah\u0027s Witness cult for so long and basically being brainwashed, Marla is one of the first individuals that opened my eyes to the dark and wicked side of that organization as she very bravely, openly, and truthfully spoke of her experience with CSA. In this episode listen as she explains early life in the cult, how individuals in that cult let her down, and how she is thriving now in her life after being in the cult.\u00A0\n\n\nI truly hope this interview helps anyone who have been hurt and let down by the Jehovah\u0027s Witness Organization.\n\n\n#EXJW #ExJehovahsWitnessSupport #CSA #CSAsurvivors #jw #jehovahswitnesses #jehovahswitnessesCSAcoverup #mentalhealth\n\n\nSupport the show (https://www.buzzsprout.com/2514763/support)",

Although it may hurt family and friends still in that organization, I have to stay true to myself. My number ONE reason for leaving is the organization\u0027s choice to hide and protect accused sexual predators within their organization in congregations around the world, not alerting the proper authorities on who they are, or what they have done. Instead, victims are shamed and silenced.\n\nI ask you to consider facts, and decide for yourself. My mission is to expose the false prophets at the world headquarters in New York, USA. The more people that are made aware of these horrible actions taking place, the sooner we can bring justice to the deserving victims.
