      "description": "Join me for a conversation with Dr Janja Lalich, cult survivor, cult researcher, educator and author.  We start with the topic of reconciling the positive with the harmful aspects of the 2x2 church and go from there!  Her books include Take Back Your Life; Recovering from cults and abusive relationships, and Escaping Utopia, focused on children raised in cults.\n\nIf you feel the need of support regarding your involvement in the 2x2 church, or in any high control group please consider looking into what Dr Lalich has to offer at the Lalich Center website:\n\nwww.lalichcenter.org\n\nmy apologies for the sometimes poor audio quality",
