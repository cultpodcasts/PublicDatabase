The video is very long so be prepared to buckle in.\n\nI know I\u2019ve said this channel is going to explore true crime cases committed by religious fundamentalists, but I also want to cover cults on this channel. This is also a detour from murder so I hope everyone still enjoys it.\n\nPlease watch and comment, and if you like it, please subscribe.
