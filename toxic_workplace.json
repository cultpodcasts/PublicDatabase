      "description": "In this bonus episode, I talk with Amanda Fangman, an aspiring writer and educator who specializes in teaching people about undue influence and coercive control in the workplace \u2013 from labor trafficking and exploitation to cultic abuse at work. If you haven\u0027t listened to Amanda\u0027s story of working for a magazine crew (Season 2, Episode 14), please listen before playing this episode as it gives context to our discussion. Amanda seeks to arm people with the crucial knowledge she wished she had before joining the workforce: general awareness of these issues, education on the warning signs and indicators of a high control workplace.
