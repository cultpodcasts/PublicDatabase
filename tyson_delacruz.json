      "description": "God, Gold \u0026 Slavery: Inside a $50M Religious Cult\n\nTwo self-proclaimed religious leaders, David Taylor and Michelle Brannon, have been federally indicted in a $50 million forced labor and money laundering scheme disguised as a ministry. Prosecutors say they enslaved followers in call centers across four states, threatened them with divine punishment, and lived off luxury homes, cars, and boats. Taylor even required \u201Carmor bearers\u201D to transport women and allegedly forced emergency contraceptives afterward. This case exposes the dark side of religious fraud predators using faith to control, abuse, and profit while their victims suffered.\n\n#ReligiousFraud #DavidTaylor #MichelleBrannon #ForcedLabor #FBI #ReligiousScam #CultExposed #tysondelacruz \n\n\u2615Support the Channel (Buy Me A Coffee)\nhttps://www.tysondelacruz.com/Buy-Me-A-Coffee\n\nCash App \nhttps://cash.app/$mrtysondelacruz\n\n\u27A1\uFE0FDISCORD\nhttps://discord.gg/kKrZWhegdu\n\n\u2705 FOLLOW TYSON ON SOCIALS\nhttps://www.tysondelacruz.com/connect-with-tyson\n\nFAIR USE NOTICE: This video may contain copyrighted (\u00A9) material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.
