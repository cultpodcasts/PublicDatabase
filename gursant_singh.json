      "description": "Abuse and Manipulation\nMahan Kirn Kaur\u0027s testimony in HBO\u0027s \u0022Breath of Fire\u0022 reveals her courageous account of being raped by Yogi Bhajan as a teen, supported by former bodyguard Gursant Singh\u0027s 30-year insider perspective.\n\nKundalini yoga, especially the Breath of Fire technique and playing of the \u0022gong\u0022, induces a highly suggestible state, making practitioners vulnerable to indoctrination and manipulation by figures like Yogi Bhajan and Harijiwan Khalsa Jr aka \u0022The Toner Bandit\u0022. \n\nYogi Bhajan\u0027s practice of having female secretaries sleep in his room under the guise of \u0022protecting their aura\u0022 in Los Angeles and Espanola is now recognized as very disturbing and debauched behavior.\n\nFinancial Fraud\nHarijiwan Khalsa Jr aka \u0022The Toner Bandit\u0022, a master manipulator trained in NLP, was indicted for fraud involving sending out invoices with no product. Harijiwan is accused by the author and former followers of using hypnotic gong playing to manipulate followers.\n\nAnother disciple of Yogi Bhajan with a similar name, Hari Jiwan Singh Khalsa was charged in a \u0022field of schemes\u0022 by the Federal Trade commission and engaged in double invoicing for toner supplies, pocketing extra money from his partners under the pretense of funding Yogi Bhajan\u0027s lavish lunches.\n\nSpiritual Corruption\nYogi Bhajan twisted Sikh scriptures (Gurbani) to create a sacrilegious mantra combining Gurbani verses with a chant to Baba Sirichand, corrupting the original teachings.\n\nIn 2009, Gursant Singh realized Yogi Bhajan was a fraud and his close disciples like the two Harijiwans were criminals who had engaged in fraudulent activities and manipulation, even after  Harijiwan Jr aka \u0022The Toner Bandit\u0022 served 18 months in federal prison.\n\nLegal and Ethical Issues\nIn 1986, Kate Felt sued Yogi Bhajan for abuse and rape, but Harijiwan Jr aka \u0022the toner bandit\u0022 denied hundreds of abuse accounts in the Olive Branch report, despite overwhelming evidence.\n\nThe HBO docuseries inaccurately portrayed Sikhism, featuring a cut-haired activist violating Sikh code and omitting traditional Sikh perspectives on weapons and firearms.\n\nPsychological Tactics\nYogi Bhajan\u0027s manipulative techniques, learned from his time as a customs officer in India, incorporated NLP and Richard Bandler\u0027s teachings to extract money, power, and sex from followers.\n\nKundalini yoga creates a synthetic high, luring people into the cult and facilitating indoctrination, posing both physical and spiritual dangers to practitioners.\n\nThe author worked through the effects of Yogi Bhajan\u0027s manipulation for over 40 years, highlighting the long-term impact of cult involvement on followers.",

      "title": "Whistleblower Exposes 3HO Yogi Bhajan SSSC Board Candidates including pro YB leader Siri Mukta Singh",
      "description": "Siri Mukta Singh Khalsa along with eight or so other over 60 year old, white male candidates running for the SSSC Board, all desire a return to the \u0022good old days\u0022 when they were privileged to hang out with Yogi Bhajan, indulging in extravagant thousand dollar lunches and shopping for jewelry in Beverly Hills. \n\nWhile yoga students toiled for less than minimum wages at Golden Temple restaurants and other Yogi Bhajan enterprises, Yogi Bhajan sexually attacked his female students along with taking millions of dollars from na\u00EFve students\u0027 inheritances. \n\nAll through the 80\u0027s, 90\u0027s and I believe into the 2000s, Siri Mukta Singh was using fake names on the phone and engaged in deceiving unaware secretaries to buy toner and other office products at highly inflated prices. You may have heard about Siri Mukta\u0027s close friend and business associate, Harijiwan, the \u0022Toner Bandit\u0022 who spent 18 months in federal prison. \n\nInterestingly there was another Hari Jiwan who was the right hand man of Yogi Bhajan. Siri Mukta was also a close associate and friend of Hari Jiwan and they both spent a great deal of time going on expensive lunches and spending sprees with YB.      \n\nBelow you\u0027ll find accounts of the indulgences by Yogi Bhajan and his \u0022good old boys\u0022. Don\u0027t forget that Hari Jiwan Singh Khalsa is a good friend and companion of Siri Mukta Singh. Siri Mukta Singh was at 80% of these thousand dollar lunches \u0026 shopping sprees in Beverly Hills. I, Gursant Singh, know because I was on guard duty for many of these outings. \n\nYogi Bhajan and Hari Jiwan bought and sold gem stones and jewelry at Jerry\u0027s on Beverly Drive in Beverly Hills California, a favorite spot for their business activities. In June 1997,one year after this photo was taken, the Federal Trade Commission filed charges against Hari Jiwan. (Taken from an FTC press release) Hari Jiwan Singh Khalsa, also known as Stephen Jon Oxenhandler, a/k/a Bob Thomas; as part of \u0022Project Field of Schemes.\u0022 This law enforcement effort comprised of approximately 61 law-enforcement actions. In its complaint detailing the charges, the FTC alleged that the defendants routinely misrepresented the risk, value, appreciation and liquidity of the gemstones they sold and falsely claimed that consumers would realize tremendous profits. In addition, the defendants falsely pledged that they could and would easily liquidate consumers\u0027 gemstone portfolios after an 18-month holding period. In fact, according to the FTC, the defendants typically ceased all contact with consumers and refused to liquidate their gemstones after the 18-month period. Shortly after the complaint was filed, the court issued a temporary restraining order, froze the defendants\u0027 assets and appointed a temporary receiver over the corporate defendants.\n\nI went to Jerry\u0027s shop in Beverly Hills with YB and HJ almost every day as I was on YB\u0027s security. I also took Shakti Parwha Kaur to Wells Fargo bank on Wilshire Blvd in Beverly Hills about three times a week to get gems and a new set of YB\u0027s jewelry that he would adorn himself with for that particular day depending on what the astrological stars said he should wear. Shakti would say, \u0022Let\u0027s go get the crown jewels.\u0022 When Shakti and I entered the room at the bank to open the numerous safe deposit boxes full of the precious stones, I was shocked the first time I saw the outrageous amount of trays displaying these huge gemstones.\n\n\u0022I went on a few of those shopping trips to Jerry\u0027s place in Beverly Hills. To me it seemed that Jerry and YB were running some sort of scam on those who were coerced into making purchases.\u0022 http://forums.delphiforums.com/Kamallarose/messages?msg=1203.349\n\n\u0022YB and Jerry double-teamed people (not just the women), urging them to purchase things because they were \u0027beautiful\u0027 or \u0027good for your aura.\u0027 \u0022\n\nYou may read all the many letters from Hari Jiwan with comments from former followers of Yogi Bhajan at: http://www.gurmukhyoga.com/forum/index.php?id=157\n\n\u0022On a gorgeous spring afternoon in 1989 the Siri Singh Sahib was viewing a special Cartier broach and chain when he received a call from one of his secretaries.......\u0022\n\nThe letter below trying to censor Gursant Singh\u0027s criticisms of Yogi Bhajan was e-mailed out in 2009 by the same Siri Mukta Singh who is presently running as a candidate for the SSSC board \n\nFrom: sirikhalsa@cybermesa.com\nSent: Thu 12/31/09 11:11 AM\nTo: sirikhalsa@cybermesa.com\n\nDear Sadh Sangat, It has come to my attention that a former member of our Sangat, Gursant Singh, has been emailing a copy of a book which is out of publication and approximately 30 years old to various Sangat members. We dealt with this negative publication many years ago. Evidently, this gentleman is continuing to try and discredit us and our beloved teacher. I send this with the prayer that you disregard any communication regarding this matter. And, I further pray that Guru Sant Singh focus on his life rather than ours.\nHumbly, SS Siri Mukta Singh Khalsa",

      "description": "The Beadbi (disrespect) of Gurbani and Siri Guru Granth Sahib Ji you see in the video, takes place every morning inside the Yogi Bhajan dera Gurdwara. \nThe woman in the video is a long time Yogi Bhajan disciple who is leading this Yogi Bhajan \u0022Aquarian Sadhana\u0022. She is sitting where the camera is zooming in, just under the portrait of Guru Ram Das Ji in the Darbar of Siri Guru Granth Sahib Ji. \n In 1992 Yogi Bhajan commanded that all of his disciples - Sikhs and non-Sikhs do something he called the \u0022Aquarian Sadhana\u0022. This was to be done \u0022forever\u0027. In other words it is a permanent part of Bhajanism. \n\nYogi Bhajan instructed the \u0022Aquarian Sadhana\u0022 should be done in the \u0022Amrit Vella.\u0022 He also commanded his disciples to perform this \u0022sadhana\u0022 in the Gurdwara\u0022. \n\nYogi Bhajan\u0027s \u0022Aquarian Sadhana is a curious mixture of Gurbani, Yogi Bhajan kundalini yoga asanas and mantras that are cut and twisted from Gurbani. There is at least one Hindu Sanskrit mantra that is chanted during the Yogi Bhajan \u0022Aquarian Sadhana\u0022.\n\nThe Wah Yantee mantra is a Hindu mantra chanted every morning at the Yogi Bhajan dera inside the Gurdwara!\n\nThe official 3HO Yogi Bhajan website describes this mantra as follows:\n\u0022This mantra was given by Patanjali, a great Yogi. It is said that over two thousand years ago Patanjali was lecturing students on prophets who would come in the iron age, the age of Kaliyug.\nHe prophesied Guru Nanak Dev Ji\u0027s coming into the world and gave the \u0022Waa Yantee\u0022 mantra which describes Wahe Guru. \nThe \u0022Waa Yantee\u0022 mantra also predicted the coming of the \u0022Wahe Guru\u0022 mantra.\nThe \u0022Wah Yantee\u0022 mantra is known for awakening the intuition.\u0022\n\nThe Wha Yantee mantra  is one of the mantras on every Aquarian Sadhana CD and is chanted every morning inside the darbar of Siri Guru Granth Sahib Ji at the Yogi Bhajan dera Gurdwara!\n\nAccording to Yogi Bhajan the practice of this mantra is the culmination of hundreds of years of prayer.\n\nThis is a Hindu and Sanskrit mantra.",

      "title": "Why does Yogi Bhajan\u0027s Cult Security Manual have a Photo of Bhaj Buster, Gursant Singh on the cover?",
      "description": "The video is a compilation of two hours plus time in which I tried to gain access to visit and have darshan from the Siri Guru Granth Sahib Ji which was in Prakash at the Yogi Bhajan \u0022Raj Yoga Festival\u0022, 10 miles up the Santa Clara Peak Road above Espanola in the Jemez Mountains of New Mexico. I know Guru Sahib Ji was in prakash because at 4:45 in the video other people driving into the compound said they were attending Gurdwara when asked by security. \n\nThere is a lot of valuable insights into the workings of the Bhajanists\u0027  organizations recorded in the video.\n\n(1) The Bhajanists evidently think my YouTube videos and FB posts exposing Yogi Bhajan\u0027s lies and abuses are so damaging to their image that they posted an 8x10 photo of myself on the security table and another in their security manual. You can see this at 9:07 in the video\nThe caption above my photo on the Bhajanist\u0027s security table states, \u0022Have you seen Gursant Singh in the Camp?\u0022  \n\nThe caption below my photo on the Bhajanist\u0027s security table states, \u0022Not Allowed in Camp?\u0022\n\n(2) In order for the Bhajanists to file an official complaint against me, they had to reveal to the police officer who the authorized person is for making the executive decisions at \u0022Ram Das Puri\u0022 LLC. I learned the responsible person and \u0022Manager\u0022, who has authority to give me a \u0022No Trespass\u0022 notice, is a Guru Sadhana Kaur Khalsa. She is the wife of Sada Sat Simran Singh Khalsa who is the head of the world famous Sikh musician group the \u0022Chardikala Jatha.\u0022\n\n Guru Sadhana Kaur is also the granddaughter of James Angleton who was the disgraced CIA head of counter espionage during the 60\u0027s and 70\u0027s. Siri Hari Kaur(Cecilia Angleton) is Guru Sadhana Kaur\u0027s niece. They are all very wealthy and helped Yogi Bhajan both financially and politically. \nGuru Sadhana Kaur (wearing a yellow kurta) is pictured consulting with the police officer on how to keep me from trespassing on the Yogi Bhajan dera compound at 20:49 in the video. \n\nEvidently, from what I have heard from reliable sources, there is a lot of infighting going on within the Yogi Bhajan orgs between those who acknowledge accounts of abuse by Yogi Bhajan and those that are complete deniers of any abuse and hold fast to their undying loyalty to Yogi Bhajan. The members who at least acknowledge the abuse did NOT want this \u0022Raj Yoga Festival\u0022 to happen but because Guru Sadhana Kaur is a Yogi Bhajan hard core loyalist, she was able to over rule the other faction of moderates. Remember the old saying, \u0022follow the money\u0022. YB loved people with power and money so is it any wonder that with all the money and influence these Angleton\u0027s have, they are pulling the strings in the YB orgs. \n\n(3) Kulbir Singh Puri, Yogi Bhajan\u0027s son was in the video at 2:18. You can see me asking for Kulbir\u0027s help so that I may have access to visit Guru Sahib Ji. Sadly Kulbir shakes his head with a No response and does nothing, instead puts his arm up to block my video camera and drives away.\n\n(4) A former SSSC board member, Guru Amrit Singh Khalsa, is shown many times in the video telling me to leave the compound. Beginning at 58 seconds into the video Guru Amrit Singh Khalsa, wearing a yellow shirt, shows no sympathy for my desire to see Guru Sahib Ji. \n\nGuru Amrit Singh is a \u0022hard core\u0022 Yogi Bhajan supporter, a complete denier of any Rape, Child Abuse, Theft, Fraud, Criminal Activity, and Abuse. by Yogi Bhajan.\n\n(5) Siri Vishnu Singh Khalsa a current SSSC Board member is shown at 23:49 in the video consulting with the police officer on how to keep me from trespassing on the Yogi Bhajan dera compound. He is wearing a multi colored vest.   \n\n Again keep in mind that I have known all these people for 20, 30, and even 40 years. They are all hard core Yogi Bhajan loyalists and deniers that Yogi Bhajan ever lied or abused anyone. \n\nYogi Bhajan\u0027s legacy is one of Rape, Child Abuse, Theft, Fraud, Criminal Activity, Drug Smuggling, Brutality, Silencing, Broken Families and Abuse. \n\nVICE Documentary \u0022Empire of Yoga\u0022 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi9S7X4PORs\n\nIs this what New Mexicans want for a Memorial Highway in our State? \n\nCome protest, Call 505 903 2675 for more information.  \n\nSign Petition: \u0022Ax The Yogi Bhajan Highway\u0022 https://www.change.org/axyogibhajanhwy\n\nVICE Documentary \u0022Empire of Yoga\u0022 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi9S7X4PORs",

      "description": "I have just received from a very reliable source, a copy of a 3HO resolution adopted by Yogi Bhajan\u0027s leadership organization called the \u0022Khalsa Council\u0022(3H0 leadership), a resolution to endorse same sex marriages in the presence of Siri Guru Granth Sahib Ji (\u0027Anand Karaj\u0027 ceremony) in their Gurdwaras. \n\nIn January 2005, the Jathedar (custodian) of Sri Akal Takht Sahib, Amritsar, Punjab, India, the highest seat of Sikh temporal-religious (miri-piri) authority for interpreting Sikh teachings, issued an edict denouncing same-sex marriages, and urging the worldwide Sikh community not to allow such marriages to take place at any Gurdwara.\u0022 In fact all the Jathedars of the Sikh Community in Punjab, have taken a strong stance against homosexual marriages amongst Sikhs.\n\nWill this resolution by Yogi Bhajan\u0027s leadership organization to allow same sex marriages in their Gurdwaras along with their continued violations of the Sikh Rehat Maryada like the practice of astrology, chanting Hindu mantras, tantric yoga and worshiping Hindu deities, motivate Sikh leadership in Amritsar to either excommunicate the Yogi Bhajan organizations from the Khalsa Panth or at least sanction them?\n\nThis discussion has been going on among the Yogi Bhajan organizations for a number of years but it seems from Friday\u0027s Khalsa Council meetings, that the leadership decided they didn\u0027t care what the Akal Takhat thinks about same sex marriage and decided to go along with what the majority of their yoga students want. It looks like it is about keeping yoga students happy and the dollars flowing.\n\nI believe Yogi Bhajan\u0027s \u0022Khalsa Council\u0022 wants to seize control of worldwide Sikh leadership and subsume Sikhi into their anti-Sikh practices and if the Akal Takhat doesn\u0027t step up and excommunicate these frauds, they just might succeed! Let\u0027s not forget what Yogi Bhajan\u0027s right hand man said 10 years ago: \u0022The Master(Yogi bhajan)later explained to me that was the way it was supposed to be as it was the beginning of the switch in Sikh leadership from the Indian community to the American Sikh yogis \u2013 recognized or not.\u0022 ~ MSS Hari Jiwan Singh Khalsa in a letter to the American Sikh community dated 06/24/2011\n\nPlease click on the link to read an article on the subject: http://tatgyan.weebly.com/marriage-in-sikh-faith.html?fbclid=IwAR3quscItufoG5-IOLWmH5ZY0_DGKlBtoiAlZqNi25NFFgR1M5tdrD35G2g\n\nBriefly, the article gives Gurbani shabads which describe marriage to be only between a man and a woman.",

      "description": "Guru Fatha Singh Khalsa, a long-time ardent Yogi Bhajan supporter, has posted a defense on the Gurmat Learning Zone of the \u0022Siri Singh Sahib\u0022 title as used by Yogi Bhajan. You may read Guru Fatha Singh\u0027s entire post below in one of the screen shots. Here is also a link to his \u0022...substantive material that appears to prove, once and for all, the reality of the title \u0022Siri Singh Sahib\u0022 and its origins and support in Siri Amritsar and within the SGPC.\u0022 https://www.messengerfromthegurushouse.com/siri.html \n\nMy response is as follows:   Allow me to lay out ALL the reasons why: a) There never was is or will be a title \u0022Siri Singh Sahib\u0022 or any title of that nature (other than in the perception of Guru Fatha Singh Khalsa and the other Yogi Bhajan defenders) b) This whole thing was a great hoax that was perpetrated by Yogi Bhajan. Of course, it\u2019s hard to prove a negative. That is why I invite Guru Fatha Singh Khalsa or any other Yogi Bhajan supporter to prove that the SSS title was awarded by either the Akaal Takhat or the SGPC. If they are able to post a proclamation or similar document here on this web site stating that the SSS title was awarded to YB I will be the first to admit I am mistaken. Letters addressed to YB do not count; I am well aware that even Gurcharan Singh Tohra - in spite of his denial that the title was ever given \u2013 took to addressing YB as SSS in the last years of his life. These are my reasons why I think this was a contrived title: 1: The hukam nama issued by Sadhu Singh Bhora (sp), Jathedar of the Akaal Takhat in 1977 which states, \u0022The title of Singh Sahib or Siri Singh Sahib has never been bestowed by me to any person, since 1965 when I was appointed Jethedar Siri Akal Takhat Sahib Amritsar.\u0022  I have attached a screen shot of the letter below. Jethedar Sadhu Singh Bhora was the person who, if the title had actually been issued in 1971, would have been the one doing it. This was all explained in an article by Anju Kaur at the Sikh Free Press \u0022American yogis distort Sikh scripture\u0022  http://web.archive.org/web/20190327091059/http://www.sikhfreepress.org/headlines/2667/american-yogis-distort-sikh-scripture\n\nAnju Kaur also published in this article a Punjabi press clipping showing that Jethedar Sadhu Singh was intending to excommunicate Yogi Bhajan from the Khalsa Panth for teaching tantric yoga etc. I have attached that press article below as well. \u0022Rojaanaa Akaalee Patrikaa Jalandhar | Daily Akali Newspaper, Jalandhar | AKAALEE PATRIKAA | Yogi Bhajan Will Be Excommunicated from the Sikh Panth; Claim of Converting 200,000 Singhs is Wrong \u2013 Jathedar Bhaura | Amritsar 10 January \u2013 (Special Representative/Reporter) Sri Akal Takhat Sahib\u2019s jathedar, Sadhu Singh Bhaura ji said here today that Yogi Harbhajan having called himself Singh Sahib is wrong. He said he sent a registered letter asking Yogi Bhajan on what authority has he made himself Singh Sahib. He said questions raised in this letter and the related hukamnama (1977) have not yet been responded to by Yogi Bhajan. | Jathedar Bhaura said he will wait a few days and after that he will give one-months\u0027 notice to Yogi Bhajan. \u0022If he does not reply, then he will be excommunicated from the Sikh Panth,\u0022 J. Bhaura said. \u0022The yogi is exploiting Sikhs in the name of Sikhi and making owls (fools) of innocent Americans.\u0022 He said that the yogi\u2019s claim that he has created 200,000 Singhs is wrong. He said that the actual numbers are 1,500 up to 2,000. He said Sikhi is based on principles, not on beard and long hair alone.\u0022 2: There was also another letter sent by the Akal Thakat to Yogi Bhajan in 1979 (attached below) wherein the Akal Thakat warned Yogi Bhajan not to use Siri Singh Sahib title or issue any hukumnama or he would be excommunicated from the panth. 3: YB was a pathological liar. It has been shown on the Wacko World of Yogi Bhajan, time and time again, that YB told many, many lies. He was especially prone to lie about his achievements and qualifications.  The point is that we are looking at someone who seemed to have no hesitation in falsifying qualifications in order to make himself appear grander to the world.\u0022 http://www.gurmukhyoga.com/forum/index.php?mode=thread\u0026id=424",

      "description": "Stop Sexual Assaults by Yogi Bhajan Kundalini Yoga Instructors! \nSign Petition: https://www.change.org/p/stop-sexual-abuse-by-yoga-instructor-3ho-s-cover-up\n\nSikhs and yoga students should all be outraged by the sexual abuses and assaults against yoga students by kundalini yoga instructor Karta Singh. I know I am outraged by Karta\u0027s shameful actions which tarnishes the reputation of Sikhs around the world and so I\u0027ve started a petition to stop him and other sexual abusers in the Yogi Bhajan cult.  \n\nJust to give you some background about these complaints against karta who is accused of sexually abusing his yoga students. There were numerous complaints from Karta\u0027s yoga students that he had been having sex with his students and at least one account that Karta had been having sex with the wife of one of his ashram members at the Amrit Nam Sovar yoga dera in France. You can see in the photo Karta touching a yoga student most probably without her permission which is unethical and could lead to further unwanted sexual advances.  \n\nThe other very troubling fact that has surfaced in these complaints is that Yogi Bhajan 3HO leaders knew about Karta\u0027s sexual abuses against his yoga students for over ten years but did nothing to stop it! Current KY trainers and former 3HO members attest in letters at the links in the description to this video that there \u0022... was an incredible amount of teachers sleeping with students and cheating on their spouses going on in Europe...\u0022 and many 3HO leaders knew about this more than ten years ago.\u0022 \n\nYou can see Karta commiserating with his 3HO buddies in this picture. One only needs to visit Karta\u0027s Facebook page to see that his friend\u0027s list reads like a who\u0027s who in the 3HO leadership! Guruka Singh, Sat Santokh Singh, Nirvair Singh, just to name a few, all 3HO and KRI leaders.  \n\nMy name is Gursant Singh and as many of you may know, I was in the Yogi Bhajan tantric yoga cult for 30 years and a personal bodyguard to Yogi Bhajan for much of that time in Los Angeles so I am very familiar with what really goes on in the Bhajanist cult. I am of the firm belief that Yogi Bhajan himself was a sexual abuser and even raped his female yoga students! I know this may be hard for many of you to stomach but the truth is that I witnessed Yogi Bhajan sleeping in the same room alone with his female secretaries and when these same female secretaries sued Yogi Bhajan for rape and sexual assault, Yogi Bhajan refused to appear and give his deposition in the cases, he would always get medical excuses from his so called personal\u0022Khalsa\u0022 doctors but I know for a fact that Yogi Bhajan was healthy enough to give his deposition because we would all go to La Scala and shop all day in Beverly Hills during this same time when the lawsuits were going on in the 1980\u0027s.  \n\nThe truth is that Yogi Bhajan cultivated an environment where men in 3HO could get away with sexually abusing women! \n\n\nThe last straw for me when I knew I had to get away from these toxic sexual predators in Yogi Bhajan\u0027s cult was when a male long time Yogi Bhajan disciple \u0026 so called friend told me how he had sexually fondled a woman in a one on one personal yoga class he was giving her. Now this male yoga teacher is a certified KY teacher trainer and continues to teach KY to many unsuspecting yoga students. This cannot be allowed to continued and sanctioned!  \n\n\n3HO needs to wake up and admit to the sexual assaults \u0026 other crimes Yogi Bhajan committed against his yoga students! 3HO needs to stop using Yogi Bhajan as a mentor for how 3HO men should act. If 3HO doesn\u0027t change this toxic environment and tear down Bhajan\u0027s empire built on lies, these sexual abuses and other crimes will continue and get worse  \n\nIn conclusion I want to encourage everyone to speak out about this issue, write 3HO, SikhNet, sign this petition and do not let these sexual predators who mooch off of others and take huge amounts of money teaching yoga classes to continue to have power over our sisters, mothers and future generations of women.",

      "description": "#WakeupSikhs : Many of you probably saw Guru Jagat Kaur\u2019s disgraceful video; Yogi Bhajan \u0022kundalini yoga orgasm for a hot date\u201D in which Guru Jagat kaur displays her large breast cleavage, adorns herself with a huge red Hindu Jyotish gemstone ring and sports a Yogi Bhajan tantric necklace dripping from her neck. What is particularly alarming for Sikhs is how Guru Jagat wears Sikhi saroop with a white dastar(turban) while giving this \u201Ckundalini yoga orgasm for a hot date\u201D advice which is completely un becoming of a Sikh woman and an insult to the Sikh religion. The video has since been deleted from fb but not after being viewed by at least 30,000 people the last time I checked at 10pm PDT last night. I won\u2019t go into all of Guru Jagat Kaur\u2019s sleazy kundalini sex teachings and Hinduvata practices which I found on the internet but I will say that my research revealed that Guru Jagat Kaur is not married and has a boyfriend who apparently buys her sex enhancement stones! Guru Jagat Kaur says in an interview... \u0022So, more sex is a great way to keep your vitality, and you can look at the jade egg as an even more advanced tool in the same vein.\u0022 \nGuru Jagat Kaur goes on to say, \n\u0022I found that Yogi Bhajan, who is the founder of Kundalini yoga, had tons of teachings on this stuff. I started looking into it, and then a few years ago, my boyfriend bought me a jade egg.\u0022 https://intothegloss.com/2015/06/jade-eggs-exercises/\nThe really disturbing reality with these types of repulsive videos produced by rising Yogi Bhajan 3HO kundalini yoga \u201Cstars\u201D is that Guru Jagat Kaur and others like her are praised by 3HO Foundation for \u201Cdedication and truth which radiate out the teachings of Yogi Bhajan in the most authentic, powerful way.\u201D See 3HO\u0027s post \u0022Your Favorite Teachers\u0022 https://www.3ho.org/featured-communities/your-favorite-teachers\nThese 3HO kundalini yoga stars refuse to accept the Sikh Reht Maryada (Sikh code of conduct) but wear Sikhi saroop and use Singh, Kaur and Khalsa in their names. Sikhs cannot help but see how 3HO KY teachers are branching out into appalling un Sikh like practices like the Kundalini / tantric yoga instructor in Australia who now teaches Kundalini yoga while her and her students are completely naked! There was the naked kundalini yogini photo posted on SoundCloud with Snatam Kaur\u2019s rendition of Kirtan Sohila which went un challenged by 3HO or Snatam Kaur for over two years despite the pleas from concerned Sikhs who wrote 3HO and Snatam Kaur to ask them to protest the photo being associated with Gurbani! The list goes on and on! It will get worse until 3HO and SikhNet get back to Sikh principles and start listening to the larger Sikh community. \nYogi Bhajan\u2019s SikhNet, 3HO and Sikh Dharma International must urgently start listening to concerned Sikhs and take a good hard look at their whole Yogi Bhajan manmat tantra / mantra philosophy before it\u2019s too late! Vikram Singh, the first westerner to play Gurbani Kirtan at Harmandir Sahib, spoke out recently on this very subject: http://gurmukhyoga.com/forum/index.php?id=835 \nAntion Vikram Singh Meredith says: \nIn my view\u2026Most of the yoga students will not accept the true discipline of Sikhi and I fully expect to see different groups of Bhajanists starting their own thing, perhaps according to geographical issues or other interests.\nMany are chafing under the central control that has always been the practice in Bhajanism. It will not take much for those who want to practice \u0022Naked Yoga\u201D or \u201CGay Yoga\u201D or any other variation of YB\u0027s yoga to start their own group. Then we will see what happens.\u0022\nGursant Singh\u0027s comments to the disgusting Guru Jagat video which were copied before the video was deleted.",

(Kindle only 0.99 cents) http://www.amazon.com/Confessions-American-Sikh-corrupt-ebook/dp/B00ANSWUPM/ref=zg_bs_158529011_1\n\nWrite Gursant Singh at Gurusant@hotmail.com for a free pdf copy.\n \nGursant Singh\u0027s recounting of his passage to India and out of a corrupt yoga empire is as enjoyable as it is compelling. This is a story of exploitation -- Gursant\u0027s victimization by his fraudulent master, Yogi Bhajan, and his own demoralizing work running scams to prop up the yogi\u0027s luxurious lifestyle. It\u0027s a quick-paced adventure that describes the ersatz Sikh lifestyle dumped on a clutch of white Americans and the peculiar dangers of the Indian bride trade.\n The book revolves around Gursant\u0027s quest for a Punjabi marriage partner. His desire to acquire a subservient wife echoes Yogi Bhajan\u0027s tantric babble about men and women. If you\u0027ve endured a Yogi Bhajan \u0022teaching\u0022 on sexuality, you\u0027ll be dismayed, but not surprised, by his longtime student\u0027s view of women. Gursant\u0027s role as Bhajan\u0027s aide and bodyguard revealed the man his followers refuse to see -- a womanizer and a brute. Yogi Bhajan\u0027s round-the-clock use of a dozen female assistants is well-known. Those who question why the self-proclaimed leader of the Sikhs of the Western world required not just a personal harem but an armed security detail will find answers here. Gursant lays out his time among the sleazy operators and criminal hustlers swirling through Yogi Bhajan\u0027s Healthy Happy Holy Organization/3HO in some depth -- not enough intricacy for some of us, but doubtless far too much for the old charlatan\u0027s remaining devotees.\n \nFortunately, the book doesn\u0027t devolve into a personal Mea Culpa nor does it read like the diary of a starry-eyed seeker. The bizarre mishmash of Eastern aphorisms and yoga postures that Yogi Bhajan concocted made his Sikh Dharma group appealing to a small, lost tribe of the counterculture. Mercifully, Gursant was no hippie and he doesn\u0027t write like one. Yet his \u0022Confessions of An American Sikh\u0022 makes the case for Sikh Dharma\u0027s inclusion as a footnote to \u002760s experimental spirituality. More importantly, this book is a fascinating look at the seamy side of the Indian marriage business and a frank exploration of life in a destructive, authoritarian group.\n \nGursant\u0027s tone is appealing whether he is describing the filthy interior of a lock-up in Amritsar or his posh daily luncheons with Yogi Bhajan on Rodeo Drive. His growing disillusionment with Bhajan\u0027s bogus spin on the Sikh religion comes to a climax while Gursant is trapped in India. He finds himself trying to emerge from two forms of imprisonment -- one physical and the other spiritual. Through it all, Gursant maintains his sense of humor and his innate faith.\n \nThis is an absorbing story for any reader. And it\u0027s a must-read for those caught up in Yogi Bhajan\u0027s 3HO/Sikh Dharma --ex-followers, Second Generation casualties, family members, law enforcement, cult researchers -- and for every Kundalini yoga student or Yogi Tea drinker, past or present. http://www.amazon.com/Confessions-American-Sikh-corrupt-ebook/dp/B00ANSWUPM/ref=zg_bs_158529011_1\n\nThis review of the Scholarly report in the video which shows Yogi Bhajan\u0027s Tantric / Kundalini Yoga is a fraud \u0026 Kundalini Yoga was Yogi Bhajan\u0027s own invention was posted on a discussion forum of ex Yogi Bhajan followers: \u0022 \nhttp://www.wackoworldofyogibhajan.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=27\u0026t=57\n\nThis article goes back and forth between what YB taught and YBers claim, and what the author, through investigation, has discovered to be true. Which is to say, he takes on many of their stretchers. He exposes their lies. \n\nHe exposes their lies just like we have been doing here for years, but he does it much better, of course.......continued",
