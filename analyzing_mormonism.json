      "description": "Captain William Kidd (or Robert Kidd) was a Scottish privateer. He was likely born in Dundee and later settled in New York City. But 1690, Kidd had become a highly successful privateer, commissioned to protect English interests in North America and the West Indies. In 1695, Kidd received a royal commission to hunt down pirates and enemy French ships in the Indian Ocean. Later, England turned against him and he was denounced as a pirate. He was arrested upon his return to Boston and stood trial in London. He was found guilty and hanged in 1701. Because of his quick arrest, many believed that Kidd hid or buried his hoards of treasure and sought to uncover it. Among those who hunted for Kidd\u0027s treasure was the man who would later be called the founder of the Mormon Church: Joseph Smith.\n\nJoin Julia and America as they discuss the sources connecting Joseph Smith\u0027s to Captain Kidd\u0027s buried treasure.\n___________________\n\nWelcome to Analyzing Mormonism!

Joseph played the role of Seer in these digs, in which he looked into his white hat at a stone that supposedly showed him the locations of buried treasure. According to Dan Vogel, Joseph was involved in at least eighteen treasure digs. According to researcher and artist, Mark Elwood, Joseph Smith could have been involved in as many as forty treasure digs. To learn more from Mark Elwood, please visit his website theglasslooker.com. \n\nIn my opinion, Joseph Smith\u0027s treasure quests are among the most fascinating of Mormon History and the most underappreciated. I hope you enjoy Dan Vogel\u0027s essay!\n\nThis episode aired on March 19, 2023.\n\n___________________\n\nWelcome to Analyzing Mormonism!

      "description": "Dozens of individuals around the world claimed to have had heavenly visions, much like Joseph Smith. This episodes highlights eighteen of those individuals who gave their accounts before 1832 (with one in 1838 from a member of the Church). \n\nThese individuals are as follows: \n\nCatharine Hummer in 1786, the Richards Brothers in 1794, David Brainerd in 1812, Benjamin Abbott in 1813, Lorenzo Dow in 1814, Rachel Baker in 1814, Norris Stearns in 1815, Elias Smith in 1816, Charles G. Finney in 1821 (though published in 1876), Benjamin Putnam in 1821, Asa Wild in 1823, Alexander Campbell in 1824, Billy Hibbard in 1825, John S. Thompson in 1826, Solomon Chamberlin in 1829, Martin Harris in 1831, Harriet Tubman in 1832, and James G. Marsh in 1838 (just before Joseph Smith gave his most in-depth account that became the canonized version).\n\nWhy is Joseph Smith\u0027s first vision so foundational to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when it wasn\u0027t written down until twelve years later, no one was told of the vision before joining the Church, Heavenly Father didn\u0027t become a character in the vision until eighteen years later, and dozens of individuals were also having visions of God and Jesus Christ?\n\nHow could Joseph Smith\u0027s first vision be \u0022the greatest event in world history since [Jesus Christ]\u0022 if it seems by all accounts never to have happened?\n\nThis episode was aired August 2, 2022.\n\n___________________\n\nWelcome to Analyzing Mormonism!

His research goes over the accuracy of the revivals occurring in and around Palmyra, New York during the 1820s. His findings are revolutionary to understanding Mormon History. \n\nWhile there is only little that I disagree with from the Mormonism Research Ministry (namely their teachings on the Bible), these findings are sound and undeniable and I thank them for this important contribution.\n\nThis episode aired on August 21, 2022.\n\n___________________\n\nWelcome to Analyzing Mormonism!

(Which is nearly identical to the court notes published in Frazer\u2019s Magazine in 1873). Another document comes from W. D. Purple, published in the Chenango Union on May 2, 1877. The final account that we read is from the New England Christian Herald published on November 7, 1832. \n\nI also want to ask that you check out Mark Elwood\u2019s book \u201CThe Glass Looker.\u201D The book is filled with gorgeous illustrations and intriguing sources for Joseph Smith as a treasure digger. You can purchase his book on https://theglasslooker.com.\n\nJoseph Smith\u0027s beginnings as a treasure digger and his using multiple seer stones, gives a whole new side to the origins of the Church and to the prophet himself.\n\n___________________\n\nWelcome to Analyzing Mormonism!

      "description": "To persuade himself to invest so much into the printing of the Book of Mormon, Martin Harris went to a man named Charles Anthon to see if he could authentic the characters taken from the golden plates.\n\nIn this episode I read from the 1838 Church History account as well as the 1832 Church History account concerning Charles Anthon. I also read from the Palmyra Freeman that was published in 1829 which discusses the ordeal in some detail. Little known, however, is that Charles Anthon himself spoke out twice concerning Martin Harris\u0027 recollection of their encounter. He spoke out in 1834 and in 1841. \n\nJoin with me as I read and discuss the man named Charles Anthon and his association with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\n___________________\n\nWelcome to Analyzing Mormonism!

Julia and Carah from NuanceHoe discuss polygamy and all its downfalls through Don Bradley\u0027s argument as presented in his recent FAIR conference as well as on Ward Radio. The evidence shows that Joseph Smith was not as reluctant to participate in polygamy as Don Bradley wants to paint him.\n\n___________________\n\nWelcome to Analyzing Mormonism!

      "description": "In response to Fawn Brodie\u0027s book No Man Knows My History BYU Professor and Mormon apologist, Hugh Nibley wrote a booklet called No Ma\u0027am That\u0027s Not History. Published in 1946, the sixty-two page booklet is now out-of-print and mostly ignored even among active Mormon circles. I hope you enjoy listening to it as much as I did. \n\nThis is episode 24 in the podcast for Analyzing Mormonism. If you wish to hear the earlier discussions of Brodie\u0027s book, you can listen to episodes 20-23.\n\n___________________\n\nWelcome to Analyzing Mormonism!

The essay seeks for greater inclusion for the LGBTQ members and poses a number of questions as to why the Family Proclamation is set up the way that it is. This is me reading that essay. It is my hope that everyone can come with empathy and leave an ally.\n\n___________________\n\nWelcome to Analyzing Mormonism!

What evidence is there that Joseph Smith did, in reality, have this heavenly vision? Were there others that validated this claim?\n\nJoin us as we analyze historical documents (including letters, newspaper articles, and the religious activities of him and his family) and explore the evidence of Joseph Smith\u0027s first vision in 1820.\n\nThis is episode 11 on the podcast.\n\n___________________\n\nWelcome to Analyzing Mormonism!
