      "description": "In episode 79 of the Moral Combat Podcast, hosts Nathan and Zach dive into a wide-ranging discussion that starts with a reintroduction of themselves and their backgrounds as sons of evangelical Christian pastors. They express excitement about returning to solo episodes, reflecting on their past interviews with various religious guests and sharing their distinct approaches to social media. The main topic centers on \u0022Christian outrage,\u0022 sparked by a viral Instagram reel featuring Nathan\u0027s provocative statement, \u0022I am God, you are God, we are God,\u0022 which garnered over 2,600 comments. The hosts humorously read and react to the outraged responses, including accusations of blasphemy and threats of divine punishment, while reminiscing about their own experiences with fear-based religious teachings. They transition to discussing the backlash against the Paris Olympics opening ceremony, criticizing the organizers for apologizing and lauding France\u0027s secular traditions. The conversation shifts to potential civil unrest in the US, which they believe would manifest as isolated incidents rather than a full-scale war, driven by fear-mongering rhetoric. They also touch on political commentary, expressing support for Kamala Harris despite her controversial past, and discussing her stance on abortion rights and the Israel-Gaza conflict. The hosts emphasize the importance of holding all leaders accountable, likening political performance to their podcast. Briefly, they address the underpayment of Olympic athletes before engaging in a playful game of Mario Kart 64, where Zach emerges victorious. Wrapping up, they seek listener feedback on their political discussions, mention upcoming merchandise, outline their guest interview approach, and explain their podcast schedule, all while maintaining a casual, humorous tone filled with personal anecdotes.\n\nMoral Combat is a podcast hosted by siblings Nathan and Zach Blaustone.

She recounts her journey of questioning her faith during college, leading to atheism at age 19, and the subsequent impact on her family relationships. Lyn discusses the ingrained guilt and shame she struggled with, eventually seeking therapy at age 28. She delves into her fascination with brainwashing and groupthink, her triggers when watching \u0022The Book of Mormon \u0027\u0027 play, and Mormon beliefs about the afterlife. Lyn highlights the growing trend of millennials and Gen Z leaving the Mormon Church, particularly over LGBTQ\u002B issues, and emphasizes the importance of finding common ground in family estrangement. She reflects on whether complete healing from religious trauma is possible, suggesting that wounds can be transformed into compassion.

Shay, host of the podcast \u0022Grow with Shay\u0022 and co-host of \u0022The Waiting Table,\u0022 opens up about her weight loss surgery in 2022, which sparked profound self-discovery and a reevaluation of her Baptist upbringing. She recounts how reconnecting with her body and emotions led her to question her faith and confront the discomfort she felt regarding the treatment of LGBTQ\u002B individuals within her religious community. Shay reflects on her marriage to Dylan, their shared deconstruction process, and the pivotal moment they considered divorce. Drawing a vivid parallel to the film Pleasantville, she describes her awakening from a \u0022black and white\u0022 existence to one full of color and emotion. Throughout the conversation, themes of self-love, intuition, and spiritual openness emerge, as Shay shares a significant encounter with the angel Gabriel and her ability to sense and name emotional blockages in others. The hosts resonate with Shay\u0027s experiences, touching on their own spiritual and psychedelic journeys, and participate in a prayer experiment to release their blockages. The episode concludes with Shay offering heartfelt advice to those deconstructing their faith, emphasizing the importance of self-acceptance and the freedom in acknowledging one\u0027s own limitations. The hosts express gratitude for Shay\u0027s genuine insights and encourage listeners to explore her podcast and workshop on blockages.\n\nMoral Combat is a podcast hosted by siblings Nathan and Zach Blaustone.

Stacey\u0027s early experiences included accepting Jesus at age six without fully understanding it and feeling pressured by her mother to make \u0022good choices.\u0022 In middle school, she found a sense of belonging in a small Church of God congregation but also felt the burden of being the \u0022good Christian girl.\u0022 College life intensified these pressures with purity culture teachings and conservative doctrines. Despite international mission trips and a long-distance relationship with her now-husband Forrest, Stacey struggled with the colonialist aspects of evangelism and the oppressive expectations placed on women. After returning to the US and marrying Forrest, Stacey began questioning her faith, spurred by political events and the church\u0027s stance on LGBTQ\u002B issues. Her healing journey has included therapy, plant medicine, and EMDR, leading her to reclaim her voice and identity.

      "description": "In episode 74 of the Moral Combat Podcast, Sorcha Porter-Homes courageously recounts her harrowing journey of enduring sexual abuse within the Calvary Chapel youth group, where leaders not only failed to protect her but blamed her for dressing immodestly. She shares vivid memories from a youth mission trip to San Francisco\u2019s Tenderloin district and the damaging purity culture that treated girls as mere \u201Cgifts\u201D for their future husbands, shaming their bodies and clothing choices. Despite the abuse happening just feet away from oblivious adult leaders, Sorcha received no support until college when she revealed her trauma to her parents, who were devastated. Therapy helped her understand that the abuse wasn\u2019t her fault. Moving to Portland marked the beginning of her and her husband\u2019s simultaneous and independent deconstruction of their faith. Expelled from Moody Bible Institute for wearing pants, Sorcha had a liberating moment in 2018, fully rejecting the church\u2019s oppressive teachings. She and her husband sold everything to travel the world and deconstruct their limiting beliefs. Sorcha, now an agnostic ethnically Jewish intuitive witch, finds healing through therapy, medication, and spiritual practices like gardening. She has rebuilt her life, running businesses focused on financial freedom and advocating for others to listen to their inner voice. Her story underscores the persistence of abuse and toxicity despite adhering to Christian doctrines, offering a message of resilience, self-discovery, and profound transformation.\n\nMoral Combat is a podcast hosted by siblings Nathan and Zach Blaustone.

      "description": "In this captivating episode of the Moral Combat Podcast, hosts Nathan and Zachary, alongside guest Ivan Rodriguez, delve into the complex journey of healing from religious trauma after disentangling from evangelical Christian church involvement. Ivan shares his poignant experiences of growing up in an authoritarian Pentecostal church in Puerto Rico, where church leadership was rife with conflicts and scandals. From a young age, he felt compelled to lead a double life, concealing his true beliefs due to the oppressive environment at home and church. Despite the joy music and playing the violin initially brought him, it became just another obligation to the church, pushing him to pursue his passion against his family\u2019s wishes. Ivan\u2019s journey towards freedom began at 18 when he left his abusive home and church, with the support of his husband, who played a crucial role in helping him deconstruct his past religious trauma. Ivan\u0027s reflection on the healing process underscores the importance of persistence, kindness to oneself, and the therapeutic power of publicly sharing one\u0027s story. His eventual acceptance into Juilliard marked a significant turning point, transforming music from a mere life-raft to a profound tool for communication and expression.\n\nMoral Combat is a podcast hosted by siblings Nathan and Zach Blaustone.

His reflections on how religious teachings may be shaped by the unhealed traumas of their authors, along with his appreciation for the courage shown by Nathaniel and Zach in addressing religious trauma through the podcast, add depth to the conversation.

Kim also shares the distressing ordeal of her yard sale sabotage and the stark realization that her community, including those she once considered family, chose the church over her. Her journey highlights the painful yet eye-opening truth about conditional support and the harsh realities she faced for not conforming to the church\u0027s expectations. This clip is a raw and powerful testament to Kim\u0027s strength in navigating through betrayal and abandonment during a pivotal moment in her life.\n\nIn Episode 65 of the Moral Combat Podcast, hosts Zach and Nathan Blaustone delve into a deep conversation with guest Kim Shambaugh, exploring the impact of religious upbringing on personal growth and healing. Raised in an evangelical Baptist family, Kim\u0027s early life was dominated by purity culture and strict religious norms. Her journey, marked by a challenging marriage and struggles with perfectionism and eating disorders, led to a transformative divorce at 26 and subsequent ostracization from her church. Finding love and acceptance with her non-religious husband, Kim moved to Ohio, where she began deconstructing her faith and embracing practices like meditation and intuitive work. Her story culminates in founding Never Settle Life, a company focused on holistic nutrition and transformation, reflecting her journey towards self-discovery and healing.\n\nFull Episode: https://youtu.be/ao703w6LSUs \n\nKim Shambaugh:\nNever Settle Life - https://www.instagram.com/neversettlelife?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D \n\nMoral Combat is a podcast hosted by siblings Nathan and Zach Blaustone.

      "description": "In this revealing episode of the Moral Combat Podcast, Jonathan Garza shares his deeply personal journey of growing up in the Seventh Day Adventist (SDA) church, a life thoroughly intertwined with its doctrines and community. From a young age, Jonathan found himself questioning the church\u2019s claim to hold the complete biblical truth, a skepticism that grew as he matured. His story takes a poignant turn with his parents\u0027 divorce, an event that, as a church leader\u0027s child, brought him embarrassment and a sense of needing to hide the truth. College years brought a significant personal revelation as Jonathan first identified as bisexual, only to temporarily retreat into the closet, under the pressure of his religious upbringing. Eventually, Jonathan fully embraced his identity as a gay man, a decision that led to a gradual but definitive distancing from the Adventist church, catalyzed by the conflicting narratives of being gay and Christian. This transition wasn\u0027t without its challenges; Jonathan lost many relationships from his church community but maintained a close, albeit complex, bond with his mother. Her gradual acceptance, though not complete affirmation, of his sexuality highlights a journey marked by struggles with perfectionism, sexual repression, and a deep-seated need for external validation - all legacies of his religious upbringing. This episode poignantly captures Jonathan\u0027s struggle to reconcile his faith and sexuality, navigating external judgments and internal conflicts, while nurturing the enduring love between him and his mother.\n\nFull Podcast Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqxJSRkMxgw \n\nMoral Combat is a podcast hosted by siblings Nathan and Zach Blaustone.

      "description": "In the emotionally charged Episode 57 of The Moral Combat Podcast, brothers Nathan and Zachary delve into the intricate and deeply personal topic of guilt, an enduring legacy of their religious trauma rooted in their evangelical Christian upbringing. This poignant discussion unravels the ways in which the church ingeniously employed guilt as a tool to wield control over their behaviors and thoughts. The narrative unfolds as they recount their struggles with a pervasive sense of inherent sinfulness and unworthiness, perpetuated by the church\u0027s unwavering emphasis on morality and repentance, a toxic blend that bred guilt like wildfire. Doubt and questioning, once taboo within the church\u0027s confines, evolved into sources of profound guilt, further stifling their quest for personal truth. The hosts candidly share the debilitating guilt that shrouded their exploration of sexuality and purity, particularly surrounding the deeply intimate issue of masturbation. Adding to this complex tapestry of trauma, their roles as pastor\u0027s kids thrust them into the unforgiving spotlight of the church\u0027s expectations for evangelism and outreach, a burden that only amplified their guilt. This lingering guilt, an enduring shadow of their religious past, seeped into their post-evangelical lives, casting a long shadow over their relationships and mental well-being. Yet, in the cocoon of their podcast, Nathan and Zachary unearth the power of vulnerability and open conversation, forging a path toward healing and ultimately finding solace in the embrace of gratitude. This episode delves into the intricate web of guilt woven by the evangelical church during their childhood, its far-reaching ramifications, and the resilience borne from these candid dialogues as the brothers journey toward healing.

      "description": "In the thought-provoking 56th episode of The Moral Combat Podcast, brothers Nathan and Zach embark on a profound exploration of the trauma inflicted by religious rituals within the evangelical Christian framework. Drawing upon their shared upbringing in a devout Christian household, the hosts engage in a candid conversation that spans a wide spectrum of rituals inherent to their religious past. They traverse the emotional terrain of their experiences, from the uplifting and spiritual nature of rituals such as worship through music and prayer, to the unsettling and, at times, manipulative aspects found in rituals like communion and altar calls.
