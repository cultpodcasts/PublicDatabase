      "title": "6: Patty Hearst: From Heiress to Hostage to Outlaw",
      "description": "In the 50th year since the kidnapping of heiress Patricia Hearst by the Symbionese Liberation Army, and the resulting crime spree that shocked the nation, we can acknowledge the vintage pedigree of the case. But was she truly a villain? She was certainly portrayed that way throughout her saga in the mid-1970s, but two US Presidents would intervene on her behalf, and she would go on to become a centerpiece on discussions of accountability, brainwashing, and Stockholm Syndrome. Pertaining to the latter, you\u0027ll get plenty of discussion on what Stockholm Syndrome actually is (and isn\u0027t).
