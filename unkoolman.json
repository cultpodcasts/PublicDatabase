One particular caller describes how it felt to be a gay man trying to deal with the oppression of Revival homophobia.\r\n\r\nThe following media is part one of four parts\r\n\r\nSee the false prophesies of this cult exposed at\r\nhttp://revivalprophecy.blogspot.com/\r\n\r\nThe full updated version of this interview can be found at\r\nhttp://revivalvideos.blogspot.com/\r\n\r\nFor more information on the Revival Churches visit:\r\nhttp://revival.aimoo.com",
