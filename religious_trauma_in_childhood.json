      "description": "In which I reflect upon being raised in a bonafide cult. Most world religions are no longer considered cults. This is due to them listening to their members and over time, often centuries, they begin to soften their harshest teachings in order to retain membership. The cult in which I was raised is still out their. Their world-wide membership is still relatively small, and while they change their teachings as \u0022new light\u0022 shines upon their cult-bosses, they seldom soften their teachings. They give lip-service to authorities. They fight in court for their rights to religious freedom and protected speech, and adjust their teachings from time to time, often leaving them with weirder and more grotesque scenarios that their followers must adapt to.\n\nI speak about what children in cults are often subjected to, how they can begin to break away even while still at home, perhaps how to spot a child going through such things as cult-children are subjected to and how to help.\n\nVisit my other YouTube channel, Vibrational Tarot for inspirational readings combined with channeled sound healing using Tibetan Singing Bowls and Voice : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG6pO9rpeo18270xB5eUkPg",
