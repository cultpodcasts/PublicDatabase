Karen considers the attributes of a human predator given in Jon\u0027s book Opening Our Minds as they apply to Hubbard.\n\nOriginally broadcast on Jon Atack\u0027s channel: @jonatackfamilyfriends6176 \n\n____\nChapters:\n\n1:33 Richard de Mille nephew of legendary Cecil de Mille connects with Jon Atack and gives some surprising info.\n\n3:06 The story of Julia Lewis Salmen. A dedicated follower who shadowed him and supplied every need throughout the 1950s and some of the 1960s. A student of the first Class VIII course, Julia was hurled over the side of the APOLLO in 1968.\n\n4:00 Hubbard did have an explosive temper, monstrous rages, deep seething anger, and bellowing ferocity.\n\n7:00 The Class VIII course was given on the Apollo in 1968, mostly consisting of 2-hour lectures for 12 days\n\n13:00 John Sanborn is asked to transfer a large sum of money into Hubbard\u0027s bank account.\n\n16:00 The tradition of throwing staff into bodies of water continued after Hubbard. David Miscavige continued this by getting staff thrown into icy cold swimming pools, bacteria-infested lakes, or hosed down with high-powered hoses so they were soaking wet.\n\n19:10 The \u0022HOLE\u0022 was also called the Scientology Dungeon where 100 top SCN Executives were imprisoned. under appalling conditions.  No one rebelled.  My ex-husband Heber Jentzsch was in the HOLE for 8 years and ended up with Alzheimer\u0027s.\n\n22:00 It\u2019s this kind of conduct that eventually ends up at Government level; when the public feel that they have no option, they report to Government authorities.  The Apollo was kicked out of every port in the Mediterranean.\n\n25:40 Recommended book by your host Jon Atack  \u0022Let\u2019s Sell these people a Piece of Blue Sky\u0022  Buy it!  Read it!  Get educated!\n\n27:00 Steve Cannane \u0027s book tells the story of Scientology in Australia. Highly recommended reading.\n\n30:00 The IRS has 1000 agents working on the SCN case before they rolled over. The new generation of CPAs and Lawyers that work in the IRS  HATE SCN. They tried to sue 1400 agents personally; the current IRS agents spit on SCN. \n\n34:00 Janis Gilham Grady is sent to me on the Apollo where I was a public member, sending an invite from Hubbard for me to join the Sea Org. \n\n37:00 In an L RON HUBBARD lecture called  ALL ABOUT RADIATION, Hubbard said NOT SMOKING ENOUGH CAN GIVE YOU CANCER:\n\n39:00 Janis Gilham Grady was with Hubbard 8 hours a day for 11 years since she was a child 13 years old. The story of her torture, kidnap and imprisonment after Hubbard assigned her liability and she was sent to the prison camps (Rehabilitation Project Force = RPF)\n\n42:00 Describing the RPF: a Hubbard devised punishment on his own designed to shrink someone into a dot. People are in this prison for YEARS\n\n47:00 The cult put out the false rumor that Janis had had a psychotic break because in the culture no one speaks to you when you have had a mental breakdown.\n\n50:03 Peter Gilham, certified chartered accountant, was put in the Chain Locker as a punishment after he angered Hubbard.\n\n51:00 A four and half year-old Derek Greene was put in the chain locker for 3 days\n\n55:00 Jon has researched the SCN cult for decades and his books have helped numerous people free themselves from the cult.",

      "description": "Podcast: Mike Rinder Talks to Jeffrey Augustine About His Bestselling New Book \u201CA Billion Years: My Escape From a Life in the Highest Ranks of Scientology.\u0022\n\nMike\u0027s new book is available for purchase on Amazon. \n\nSummary: \nOne of the highest-ranking defectors from Scientology exposes the secret inner workings of the powerful organization in this remarkable memoir.\n\nMike Rinder\u2019s parents began taking him to their local Scientology center when he was five years old. After high school, he signed a billion-year contract and was admitted into Scientology\u2019s elite inner circle, the Sea Organization. Brought to founder L. Ron Hubbard\u2019s yacht and promised training in Hubbard\u2019s most advanced techniques, Mike was instead put to work swabbing the decks.\n\nStill, Rinder bought into the doctrine that his personal comfort was secondary to the higher purpose of Hubbard\u2019s world-saving mission, swiftly rising through the ranks. In the 1980s, Rinder became Scientology\u2019s international spokesperson and the head of its powerful Office of Special Affairs. He helped negotiate Scientology\u2019s pivotal tax exemption from the IRS and engaged with the organization\u2019s prominent celebrity members, including Tom Cruise, Lisa Marie Presley, and John Travolta.\n\nYet Rinder couldn\u2019t shake a nagging feeling that something was amiss\u2014Hubbard\u2019s promises remained unfulfilled at his death, and his successor, David Miscavige, was a ruthless and vindictive man who did not hesitate to confine many top Scientologists, Mike among them, to a makeshift prison known as the Hole.\n\nIn 2007, at the age of fifty-two, Rinder finally escaped Scientology. Overnight, he became one of the organization\u2019s biggest public enemies. He was followed, hacked, spied on, and tracked. But he refused to be intimidated and today helps people break free of Scientology.\n\nIn A Billion Years, the dark, dystopian truth about Scientology is revealed as never before. Rinder offers insights into the religion that only someone of his former high rank could provide and tells a harrowing but fulfilling story of personal resilience.",

      "description": "Mike Rinder and Jeffrey Augustine discuss the Church of Scientology in 2019. Topics discussed:\n\n\n1. The powerful and effective work of attorney Graham Berry in exposing and getting justice for the elderly victims of Scientology credit card and bank loan frauds. Graham stood out as a true hero in 2019.\n\n2. Rizza Islam et. al. to stand trial in 2020 for ripping off $3.8 million in a Medicare fraud based on running high school students through the Scientology-Narconon Purification Rundown. Jeffrey comments on his observations of the preliminary criminal trial at which the Islam family defendants used a bizarre sovereign citizen argument.\n\n3. Mike Rinder explains why he sees an inevitable divorce between the Nation of Islam and the Church of Scientology occurring very soon. Alfreddie Johnson, Tony Muhammad, and Louis Farrakhan are discussed. \n\n4. Mike and Jeff discuss Scientologists and crime: The Spina Brothers $80 million Medicare fraud for which the brothers will be sentenced in February 2020; the $1.8 billion Ponzi scheme known as GPB Capital Holdings that is owned and operated by Scientologist David Gentile. \n\n5. Jeffrey asks why the Church of Scientology is defending alleged serial rapist Danny Masterson even as Sea Org member Taryn Teutsch cynically used the #MeToo movement and the rape survivors in Denim Day in an attempt to get her father Mike Rinder fired from Scientology and the Aftermath. \n\n6. Jeffrey mentions that Curacao, the homeport of the Freewinds, is an island engaged in sex trafficking of women from Venezuela and other countries. Curacao is home to the largest open air brothel in the world, the notorious Campo Alegre. Scientology has never once protested sex trafficking or the other human rights abuses on Curacao despite the Church\u0027s claimed commitment the UN Human Rights charter. See Jeffrey\u0027s story on this at his blog: https://scientologymoneyproject.com/2019/05/04/scientologys-freewinds-home-port-is-curacao-an-island-engaged-in-sex-trafficking-forced-human-labor/\n\n7.

The Church of Scientology tried to convince Guy to divorce Suzette and remain in the Sea Org. Guy wanted his son to be with him. However, the Church feared that any custody battle could become a public legal matter and involve Mary Sue Hubbard as Suzette was living with her mother. Guy soon left the Sea Org and he and Suzette worked to reestablish their lives outside of the Sea Org. \n\nGuy disabuses the notion that L.

He soon joined Scientology staff and his dreams of music soon disappeared under the heavy demands of statistics. Robert worked as a body router and held other positions as a staff member. \n\nWhen Robert finished his staff contract he went into the printing business with a fellow Scientologist. Soon, the two were printing all of the magazines for Scientology Europe.

But then there was a problem.  Robert solved it but he was nevertheless blamed for crashing all of Scientology\u0027s stats on the European Continent. \n\nRobert was sent to Flag for brutal sec checking. In this podcast Robert describes the terror of being sec checked by then Inspector General RTC Marty Rathbun. \n\nThese sec checks had a brutal and expensive outcome. Coupled with Robert\u0027s inner torment with having to constantly pretend to others that he was an OT ate him up inside. \n\nRobert describes the events that led to he and his family leaving Scientology.

As part of her platform, Shastina opposes the widespread psychiatric drugging of children. Upon learning of her position on psychiatric medications, Scientology sent in an operative from its notorious front group Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR).  The CCHR agent met Shastina at a political meeting and gave her a CCHR package of materials. The agent never told CCHR was a part of the Church of Scientology. Rather, the CCHR agent played upon Shastina\u0027s opposition to drugging children and got her to support CCHR on her podcast. \n\nIn the podcast, Shastina and Jeffrey also discuss Scientologist Joy Villa and her foray into politics. Of note is Joy Villa\u0027s insistence that she is a Christian and a Scientologist when, in fact, Scientology does not allow its members to engage in other practices and considers all other religions to be implants.\n\nArticle on Shastina on the Scientology Money Project: https://scientologymoneyproject.com/2018/04/14/scientology-meddling-into-shastina-sandmans-us-congressional-campaign/\n\nFollow me on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/SurvivingScientology/\nFollow me on Twitter - https://twitter.com/KarendlaCariere\nMy Husband\u0027s Blog- https://scientologymoneyproject.com/\nRadio Podcasts - http://www.survivingscientologyradio.com/",

Valeska then describes the suicide of her stepfather Scientologist Albert Jaquier; the suicide of a member of a Sea Org member on the Freewinds; and the punishments she suffered on the ship. Valeska talks about her relationship to Shelly Miscavige who has not been seen in public for over a decade.  Other people discussed include Mike Napier, the Captain of the Freewinds, Guillaume Leserve, Heber Jentzsch, and Tom Cruise and his $400,000 birthday party on the Freewinds.\n\nAlbert Jacquier kept a diary as he was dying. After his death his wife, Valeska\u0027s mother, published it online. \u0022The Diary of a Dying Scientologist\u0022 is posted here: http://www.xenu.net/archive/photoalbum/jaquier.html\n\nFollow me on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/SurvivingScientology/\nFollow me on Twitter - https://twitter.com/KarendlaCariere\nMy Husband\u0027s Blog- https://scientologymoneyproject.com/\nRadio Podcasts - http://www.survivingscientologyradio.com/",

Among his other duties, Nibs served as an Enforcer for his father. Nibs left the Church. He later spoke out against his father and even sued to gain control of his father\u0027s estate. Nibs famously granted Penthouse Magazine an interview in which he said that Scientology was Black Magick spread out over time and that his father thought of himself as the Antichrist. Nibs was eventually \u0022recovered\u0022 by the Church of Scientology for an undisclosed sum of money. In exchange, Nibs recanted everything he had said about his father and thereby destroyed his own credibility forever. Jeffrey asks Jon, \u0022Is Marty Rathbun the new L.

      "description": "Please subscribe to my channel  and click the BELL beside the subscribe button for notifications..\n\nThis video :\nFormer Sea Org member Jason Harris was the D/Chug Project I/C for Technical (Director, Chug Project. In Charge for Technical. Jason was part of Scientology\u0027s  INCOMM computer unit where he read L. Ron Hubbard\u0027s super-secret \u0022Chug advices.\u0022 These advices were so secret that only a handful of Sea Org members have ever been allowed to read them. Anyone who reads the Chug advises had to sign a $500,000 bond. That was the size of the penalty Scientology wanted if anyone revealed the contents of Hubbard\u0027s Chug advices. \n\nWhat did the Chug advices say? From Jason Harris writing at xenu.net in 2008: http://ocmb.xenu.net/ocmb/viewtopic.php?f=9\u0026t=29126\n\n\u0022Chug was the name of a planet, that according to Hubbard, almost suffered from a revolution. The computer system put together the facts of civil unrest, and reduced tax revenue. It determined that the current Duke of Chug was actually increasing taxes, but not forwarding them on - he was embezzling the money. \n\n\u0022Hubbard\u0027s idea was that we could create a computer system similar to this. One that would watch the world wide scientology stats, and detect problem areas. Then take immediate action and prevent the situation from getting out of hand. \n\n\u0022So the computer would detect a scientology org that was not doing well, evaluate all the statistics, and then issue a rote \u0022handling\u0022. \n\n\u0022And BTW, according to Hubbard, that computer ordered the Duke of Chug executed. This was carried out and the planet went back to \u0022normal\u0022. \n\n\u0022Accordingly, the computer systems we programed had unlimited ethics powers, backed by Hubbards ethics policies. They never ordered anyone executed, but they had the full gamut of scientology ethics to apply. \n\n\u0022The SP Hall reminds me of the end result of another system. This was called Orders Logging. You may have heard BFG mention COB\u0027s staff that do nothing but log all the insane orders he gives? Well we designed and implemented a system that helped not only track all these orders, but tell you who was continually non-complying. All the orders were integrated, and non-compliance to one, meant all your other orders went up a notch. \n\n\u0022Every time you non-complied to an order from COB (no matter how ridiculous it was) you went up a gradient. This starts from noting your non-compliance, ordering a debug on the target, up the gradients through ethics investigations and hearings, then onto committes of evidence (courts martial). The end result of continual non-compliance was you getting a provisional SP declare, and eventually the real declare. Sound familiar? \n\n\u0022Scary stuff, but more about the contents of Dick Misgrabbich\u0027s order logging system later.\u0022\n\nFor more information on Scientology please visit The Scientology Money Project: https://scientologymoneyproject.com/\n\n\nFollow me on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/SurvivingScientology/\nFollow me on Twitter - https://twitter.com/KarendlaCariere\nMy Husband\u0027s Blog- https://scientologymoneyproject.com/\nRadio Podcasts - http://www.survivingscientologyradio.com/",

Big Tobacco, asbestos, pharmaceutical companies, and certain surgical procedures such a hip replacements have been the subject of daytime television ads by law firms in search of the next big class action lawsuit. \n\nThe Scientology Money Project (SMP) states that US Narconons reported ~$60,000,000 in 2012 revenues. SMP estimates  is that Narconon globally takes in $100,000,000 per year.\n\nScientology-Narconon has deep pockets, and, Narconon International\u2019s Legal Affairs Director stated in an e-mail that there is no scientific basis for Narconon\u2019s claim of a 70% success rate. \n\nSee the Scientology Money Project for more details: http://scientologymoneyproject.com/2015/02/09/law-firm-using-television-ads-to-target-scientologys-deceptive-narconon-drug-treatment-centers/",

      "description": "In this satirical video Scientology attorney E. Stuart Mills meets with a senior Church of Scientology official to discuss a very expensive problem. Scientology Dictator David Miscavige, it seems, is caught in a hellish dilemma. \n \nDavid Miscavige absolutely wants to be in charge the entire Church of Scientology and its vast piles of money, lawyers, PI\u0027s building, and everything else.\n \nAny yet, Miscavige told the IRS he is only in charge of the Religious Technology Center (RTC). Now that he is being named in lawsuits, Miscavige has to stick with the script he gave to the IRS. If it is proved that Miscavige runs the entire Church of Scientology then several corporate veils are pierced. This could cause big trouble. Therefore, Miscavige has to spend a fortune lawyers to keep all of his lies in place:\n \n* Captain Misavige\u0027s rank means nothing -- and don\u0027t you dare call him \u0022Captain\u0022 or else!\n \n* Captain Misavige has nothing to do with managing the daily affairs of the Church of Scientology International. \n \n* Captain Miscavige does not have a phone. But maybe he does. \n \nAs OTVIIIisGrrr8! wrote on December 10, 2014 on the Underground Bunker: \nWe in RTC feel the need to point out the obvious to the Chattering Wog Classes who understand neither the subtleties nor the niceties of the Scientology religion.\n\n1. Mr. Miscavige has no connections to Oklahoma, Texas, or anywhere else in the physical universe.\n\n2. As a Sea Org member, Mr. Miscavige is simply a part of an unincorporated membership association that has no address, no bank account, no stationery, and does not exist.\n\n3. Above all, as a thetan, Mr. Miscavige is a static. What is a static? As defined by Axiom 34, the ultimate truth is a static:\n\n\u0022Axiom 35: The ultimate truth is a static. A static has no mass, meaning, mobility, no wavelength, no time no location in space, no space. This has the technical name of \u0027basic truth.\u0027\u201D\n\nEssentially, then, Mr. Miscavige simultaneously does not exist, and, Mr. Miscavige is the ultimate truth. This explains why the mere mention of his name as-ises lawsuits and they vanish.\n\nAll lawsuits against Mr. Miscavige contain lies that cannot persist in the presence of ultimate truth.\n\nTherefore, any attempt by wogs to sue the ultimate truth who is being the nonexistent Mr. Miscavige only as an administrative convenience to facilitate the straight up and vertical expansion of Scientology organizations is doomed to failure. The ultimate truth cannot be sued anymore than any other nonexistent entity can be sued. Sue David Miscavige? One might as well sue Mickey Mouse for all the good it does.\n\nIt is futility itself to sue a static who does not actually exist in time and space. Mr. Miscavige\u0027s supernal physical body is actually a manifestation, or incarnation, of ultimate truth. The only thing that can be said about this supernal manifestation is that it likes to drink fine scotch and will never make itself available for either the service of summons or for deposition; this is the Tao of David Miscavige you see.\n\nDiscuss This on Reddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/\n\nRadio Podcasts\nhttp://www.survivingscientologyradio.com/tag/surviving-scientology/\n\n\nFollow me on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/karendelac\nFollow me on Twitter - https://www.twitter.com/KarendlaCariere\nFollow me on Google\u002B - https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/101921892352567477207/\u002BSurvivingScientology",

      "description": "When it comes to taking a person\u0027s money, the  Church of Scientology moves at the speed of light. When it comes to refunding money, however, the Church moves in a geological time frame and uses its bad faith sham contract terms to make it virtually impossible to get money back. \n\nOne example: By definition, donations to the IAS are inherently out exchange as nothing is exchanged with the donor. Compounding this violation of its own \u0022doctrine of exchange\u0022 that Scientology made such a big deal about with the IRS, IAS donations are non-refundable per the donation contract. \n\nThe inference here is that the IAS does not practice the doctrine of exchange and admits such when takes in donations on a nonrefundable basis. The IAS is yet another wealth extraction scam in the larger Scientology con game masquerading as a religion. \nThe Church of Scientology has given out a few refunds here and there. However, whenever it has done so there is always an SP Declare, a non-disclosure agreement, or some other self-serving penalty attached. \nThe Church of Scientology: Abandon hope all ye who enter these gates!\n\nDiscuss This on Reddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/\n\nRadio Podcasts\nhttp://www.survivingscientologyradio.com/tag/surviving-scientology/\n\n\nFollow me on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/karendelac\nFollow me on Twitter - https://www.twitter.com/KarendlaCariere\nFollow me on Google\u002B - https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/101921892352567477207/\u002BSurvivingScientology/",

The Church\u0027s favored form of attack is to call anyone who disagrees with it a bigot. \n\nWhy does the Church respond with such venom?\n\nIt is because Church of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard wrote a doctrine that orders Scientologists to attack any person or group that criticizes Scientology, \n\nIn this video Scientology critic Jeffrey Augustine discusses how Hubbard\u0027s \u0022Attack the Attacker!\u0022 doctrine cripples the Church by forcing it to engage in hostility rather than honestly and forthrightly addressing criticism as do other religions. \n\nAugustine has long noted that the Church of Scientology has no apologetics and therefore defaults to the violence of Fair Game, stalking, harassment, and ad hominem attacks on its critics.

It can cost $50,000 to $100,000 in Sec checks (confessionals)  These Sea org members, Ethics Officers and OSA INT Sea org members  are not on drugs.  They are not on alcohol.  They are stone cold sober.  Stone cold obsessive.  Stone cold paranoid on outside influences that could burst the Bubble.\n\nIn other words, the Church wants to be the ONLY influence and considers *ANY* influence other that fundamental Hubbard\u0027s  doctrines to be insidious, predatory, stretching with octopus tentacles into Church rank and file and negatively INFLUENCING the mind set. Scientology is basically a culture of isolation. Hence the Public and staff are forbidden to read the Internet.  Sea Org members are not even permitted to go their local library, leave alone surf the web.\n\nParents who demand some Christmas/Thanksgiving time with their own children (that they have turned over to the Sea org) are considered \u0022external Influences\u0022.   Sending gifts. money  to own kids can be viewed as such.\n\nThis is carried on to such an absurd degree, that almost ANYTHING that is not 100% Scientology  or Sea Org 24/7/365 can be deemed an \u0022EXTERNAL INFLUENCE\u0022.\n\nIn Part 2 of this Video I will explain \u0022Rollback technology\u0022 that the Church dramatizes with  inquisitions and investigations on these \u0022EXTERNAL INFLUENCES\u0022 that Scientology feels is *corrupting* the purity of total devotion to Scientology at the level of sacrifice of every thing else.\n\n\nRadio Podcasts\nhttp://www.survivingscientologyradio.com/tag/surviving-scientology/\n\n\nFollow me on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/karendelac\nFollow me on Twitter - https://www.twitter.com/KarendlaCariere\nFollow me on Google\u002B - https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/101921892352567477207/\u002BSurvivingScientology/",

A person must also take increasingly high daily doses of niacin until they reach a 5,000mg maximum. \nI have heard from some credible sources that there is an insistence on continuing the Purif at 5000 Niacin for some time before a person can attest they are done.  This is a Miscavige Order.

Chuck also discusses his experiences in Author Services Incorporated and the way Miscavige used ASI to assume power over the Church prior to becoming COB RTC. Chuck describes how ASI was created as a legal way to funnel money to L. Ron Hubbard. Jeff mentions a little known fact: David Miscavige had a life-threatening asthma attack in 1980. Emerging from this crisis in a hospital emergency room, David Miscavige told Paul Grady that he had a revelation that \u0022Power is Assumed\u0022 and thereafter began to assume power in the Church by whatever means it required.\nThis is part 2 of an on going Series exposing \u0022Author Services\u0022.\n\nRadio Podcasts\nhttp://www.survivingscientologyradio.com/tag/surviving-scientology/\n\n\nFollow me on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/karendelac\nFollow me on Twitter - https://www.twitter.com/KarendlaCariere\nFollow me on Google\u002B - https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/101921892352567477207/\u002BSurvivingScientology/",

This radio interview is about Sea Org life.\nJeffrey summarized it nicely ~\nI consider Sea Org members to be slaves and discuss this in part of my interview with Chris Shelton that will be released. The Cult has staked out a position whereby SO members are \u0022volunteers\u0022 of a religious order. IMO, there are numerous ways to legally challenge this, one of which is false imprisonment -- particularly when the SO recruitment process can be shown to be false and misleading in such a way as to lead a person to sign an unconscionable contract that leads to the unjust enrichment of the Cult of Scientology via the exploitation of captive workers.\n\nThis is false imprisonment under the cover of a religious order.\n\nNow that 990-T\u0027s are released, law firms, agencies, and governments can see that the Church has accumulated and hoarded money via a series of false and misleading representations made to its parishioners coupled with the the false imprisonment and exploitation of SO members. There is a pervasive and institutionalized pattern of conduct awash in lies, falsehoods, contracts of adhesion, unclean hands, self-dealing, and unconscionability. No one advised in advance of the actual situation, no one who had legal counsel beforehand concerning the actual terms and conditions, would agree to such bad faith and malicious conduct as practiced and perpetrated upon persons in the Cult of Scientology.\n\nDiversity, jurisdiction, and various causes of action are now known. IMO, the corporate veil has already been breached and it can be shown that the Church of Scientology is the alter ego of David Miscavige.\n\nRadio Podcasts\nhttp://www.survivingscientologyradio.com/tag/surviving-scientology/\n\nScientology Tax documents here ~~\nhttp://scientologymoneyproject.com/",

Several different issues may come up for discussion today. Monique filed a notice to depose David Miscavige on January 29, and Scientology responded with a motion to quash the deposition. Scientology also asked Judge Dib Waldrip to reconsider his order allowing Monique to depose Miscavige. But the main action today may be Monique\u0027s motion for sanctions. She\u0027s asking Judge Waldrip to punish Scientology because its employees, she says, have been dishonest in depositions and because Scientology has not turned over evidence.\n\nFor complete coverage check out Tony Ortega\u0027s Underground Bunker:\n\nhttp://tonyortega.org/2014/01/22/monique-rathbun-seeks-sanctions-scientology-tries-to-kill-miscavige-deposition-in-court-today/\n\nRadio Podcasts\nhttp://www.survivingscientologyradio.com/tag/surviving-scientology/",

Filing endless motions to stop the progress of any law suit rather than fight on merit is par for the course on this *pretense* of a religion which has morphed into  a runaway money extortion machine. In this video I tell about the the pressure on their staff  that was so great (included sleep deprivation ) to sell these re-packaged books \u0022The Basics\u0022.    Church staff stole unused payments and  billed clients accounts for Basics at $3000 or $5000 a set (unauthorized) on credit cards on file and unused advance payments.

David Miscavige bragged he made the Church $10 million dollars in one day. The fall out on staff was pretty horrific. Sleep deprivation was enforced on those that did not make their quotes. All staff, including Security Guards, OSA INT, canteen workers, you name it, EVERY staff member had to SELL for 2 1/2 hours a day in their so called \u0022study time.\u0022 Money extraction was THE prime target.\nThe public were scammed. Duped into high pressure from desperate andsleep deprived Sea Org Members, the public believed they were buying copies for *every* Library in the USA, then for each country in the world.\nBecause of limited shelf space, all libraries handle unsolicited donations the same way. They throw the unasked for books in the dollar bin, or they give them to someone, or they just throw them away or \u0022Return to Sender.\u0022 While Bridge Publications, knew these bundles of books were being returned by the truckload, none of the scammed money was returned to the Public and US libraries have a fraction of the \u0022Basics\u0022 that Scientology Inc pretends.\nWorse than that staff members charged unauthorized purchases of these Basics on credit cards, stealing $$$ and used up advance payments on account. The theft and criminality inside the Sea org took on a new level.\n\nRadio Podcasts\nhttp://www.survivingscientologyradio.com/tag/surviving-scientology/\n\nFollow me on TWITTER  @KarendlaCariere\nFollow me on FACEBOOK   https://www.facebook.com/karendelac?ref=tn_tnmn",

A ship chose to be the head office and corporation address of \u0022International Association of Scientologists\u0022 as a tax haven.  The Freewinds is not beholden to any government and on the high seas is away from the prying eyes of the FBI.  Unspeakable punishments are carried out here.  Senior Executives (my ex-husband Heber Jentzsch included) have to clean the BILGES 12 to 14 hours a day.  Scott endured sleep deprivation for months before he had a mental breakdown.  The 4 earlier videos in these stories tell you more of his story.   This is the finale and happy ending.\n\nRadio Podcasts\nhttp://www.survivingscientologyradio.com/tag/surviving-scientology/",

After serving 16 years in the so called \u0022clergy\u0022 of the Sea Organization, her son died at 27 of pneumonia on multiple drugs mainly METHADONE, a heroin derivative.   He was orphaned.  His father, imprisoned at the infamous \u0022Gold Base\u0022 Gulag for the last 20 years was only permitted to see Alexander 11 times in the last 15 years.   The Church manipulated and forced Alexander to \u0022disconnect\u0022 from Karen for the last 2 years of his life.\nHe was also trained to spy and report on his own Mom and \u0022knowledge report\u0022 her.\nAll children in the Church are trained at a very young age to snitch and rat on their own parents,\nThis is very prevalent in 2nd generation Scientologists who grow up in it all.\n\nFollow me on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/karendelac\nFollow me on Twitter - https://www.twitter.com/KarendlaCariere\n\n\nhttps://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-scientology-fair-game-68514402/episode/episode-8-fair-gaming-the-scientology-71493695/?keyid%5B0%5D=Scientology%3A%20Fair%20Game\u0026keyid%5B1%5D=Episode%208%3A%20Fair%20Gaming%20the%20Scientology%20President%27s%20Ex-wife\u0026sc=podcast_widget",
