      "description": "Send us a Text Message. Ever wondered what it\u0027s like to break free from a high-control environment? Join us as we celebrate Tia Leving\u0027s incredible achievement\u2014her book \u0022A Well-Trained Wife\u0022 has skyrocketed to the New York Times bestseller list. We share stories from our own past about compassionate bystanders who made a big difference and offer practical suggestions for ways to meaningfully support those in a major life transition or in a crisis situation. We also talk about the complex emotions of loss and new beginnings when cherished dreams crumble into dust. We reflect on the inevitable grief of unmet expectations and the magic of learning to hold mystery, uncertainty, and two competing truths at once. Finally, we touch on the unexpected influence of evangelical fundamentalism and Calvinism on contemporary Anabaptist communities, scratching our heads at the seeming contradictions and unlikely resonances between these religious traditions given their vociferous theological differences in past centuries.

      "description": "Send us a Text Message. Are women guilty of manipulation and passive-aggressive tendencies? Sure! However, we are here to point out that these tactics are used across the board by women AND men. Moreover, we can\u0027t ignore the unfortunate reality that many of us were trained as young children to avoid more direct ways of communicating, so manipulation is often the only tool available to us to get our needs met. In this episode, we talk about the role of authoritarian religious parenting in conditioning us to use manipulation to get our needs met, the social pressures that further promote manipulation, and the projection that often lurks behind accusations of manipulation. Rather than buying into notions of women as the \u0022weaker sex\u0022 and thus more prone to \u0022emotional irrationality,\u0022 we uncover the power struggle behind these deep-seated sexist ideas to show how they trap women (and men!) in dysfunctional and dissatisfying relationships. We also suggest more healthy alternatives that offer liberation to ourselves and our loved ones.

      "description": "Send us a Text Message. What if the best way to get ready for fall is to rest this summer? In this episode we challenge common expectations about productivity and laziness, making the case that rest is not a luxury but is foundational for being the happy, relaxed parent our children need. We\u0027re sharing 15 ways we\u0027re making the most of summer\u0027s remaining weeks. Instead of working harder, we\u0027re trying to work softer, to focus on what really matters, and soak up some low-brow fiction and TV. We discuss practical ways to prepare for the onslaught of school forms and artwork that will soon be pouring in and share our best tips for making housework and meal prep easier come fall.

      "description": "Send us a Text Message. This week we start out with an update on Naomi\u0027s recent health adventures and then turn our attention to recapping the first weekend in June when we attended a Symposium on How Our Amish Heritage Influences Our Education and Career at Elizabethtown College. It all started with a very social Costco run to kick off our girls\u0027 weekend with all the necessary supplies (cheesecake, almonds, and salsa, FTW). Next, we reflect on the Symposium and themes that emerged over the course of the day. Specifically, there was a consensus on what didn\u0027t matter nearly as much as we\u0027d feared (being smart enough) and what did matter (moral support and resources). Surprising challenges included things like the difficulty of finding new social circles and the loneliness of having no one to understand or celebrate your academic successes with you. Finally, we look ahead to possible future Symposia (join us!) and wonder about the need for a memoir writing workshop/group/retreat of some kind. And if you listen to the end, you\u0027ll learn how to enter to win a copy of Lizzie Hershberger\u0027s memoir, Behind Blue Curtains! Links to all the things we mentioned (or should have): Sonder : The profound feeling of realizing that everyone, including strangers passing in the street, has a life as complex as one\u0027s own, which they are constantly living despite one\u0027s personal lack of awareness of it (Wiktionary) A City at Work: 1912 and 2012 , specifically Mercy Hospital Operating Room: 1912 vs. 2012 A Heart for Truth (Cousin Erma\u2019s podcast) How Our Amish Heritage Influences Our Education and Career: A Symposium (event recap on Saloma Furlong\u2019s blog) Young Center for Anabaptist and Pietist Studies at Elizabethtown College Amish Descendant Scholarship Fund (Naomi Kramer Yoder and Emma Miller) Lizzie Hershberger , author of Behind Blue Curtains: A True Crime Memoir of an Amish Woman\u0027s Survival, Escape, and Pursuit of Justice Thanks for listening!

      "description": "Send us a Text Message. Have you ever reread a cherished story from childhood only to find your sense of nostalgia replaced by cringe? In this episode, we reflect on The Pineapple Story, a seemingly innocent book that, for us, represents a mashup of influences that colored our upbringing and sense of the world. The Pineapple Story is just one example of a missionary story that at first glance may seem to be an inspirational story of faith and personal growth, but when examined more closely, reveals a colonialist, xenophobic mindset and political agenda. We use research and analytical tools learned in college to question its assumptions and challenge its narratives. Links we (should have) mentioned: The Pineapple Story Western New Guinea (Wikipedia) Peek behind the IBLP curtain in the documentary, Shiny Happy People, that we reviewed last year here and here .

      "description": "Send us a Text Message. Have you missed us? We\u2019ve missed you! This episode was recorded in mid-May 2024 but not released until mid-June because of some health issues that threw a wrench in our production plans. We\u0027re happy to report that all is well and we\u0027re back in action. ------- Many of us who are the first in our families to go to college might be held back by the worry that we aren\u2019t smart enough for college. If that\u2019s true for you, you\u2019re in the right place! In this episode, we share our short quiz that will help put that question to rest once and for all. We also suggest more useful questions to ask when considering college and wondering how it might fit into a life that already has a full plate of responsibilities. We conclude that when a strong work ethic and a positive attitude aren\u2019t enough to help us reach big life goals, radical acceptance can often open our eyes to new strategies for overcoming obstacles in life.

We\u0027re also excited about the new texting option for listeners. (Click the link above to try it out!) Have you ever been overwhelmed by life circumstances beyond your control and wondered what good therapy could do? Maybe you\u0027ve tried everything and concluded there\u0027s nothing to be done so why talk about it? We\u0027ve been there too! Today we\u0027re unpacking those feelings and dishing about the good, bad, and the ugly of our own experiences with therapy. We discuss qualities we look for in a therapist as well as the value of reflecting on our emotional health and what important messages might be embedded in our deepest, darkest emotions.

This episode is for anyone who has called many different places home and often waffles just a bit before answering the question, \u0022Where are you from?\u0022 How do we answer this simple question while accounting for all the twists and turns and layers of experience that make up our identity? How deep do our roots need to go before we can claim to be Amish or Mennonite--or any other particular cultural identity? To help make sense of the patchwork of our lives, we turn to three different ways to understand cultural dynamics and to discuss why we can expect that any two individuals in the same culture will have significantly different experiences.

In this episode, we (Naomi and Rebecca) talk about our own experiences with campus visits--which came much later than you might expect. Now that we have experienced campus visits from a variety of roles, we\u0027re here to give listeners the low-down about what to ask, what to listen for, and what to consider when evaluating your options. The good news is that no one has it all figured out before they get started, but it\u0027s not too soon to start exploring your options today. Thanks for listening!

We start this episode with a pop culture minute where we wonder aloud about the Royal Family\u0027s odd handling of Kate Middleton\u0027s recent absence from the public eye as well as the public\u0027s reaction to the public\u0027s reaction. Then we shift our focus to analyze a short video clip of a domestic argument and the responses it prompted on social media. We discuss some of the different ways respect is defined and interpreted in families and by leaders, and we reflect on what we have personally observed about double standards in expectations for socially acceptable behavior. What kind of risks come with upholding a \u0022united front\u0022 at all costs? What does it mean when popular narratives have a survivorship bias and what is the minimum we all deserve in our relationships?

We reflect on last week\u0027s episode and the events that prompted it--such as public figures spreading misconceptions about Amish culture and failing to honor the truths of those living in high-demand religion. We stress the importance of listening to and respecting the broad range of individual experiences that together make up a culture far more dynamic and complex than any fiction writer could imagine. We also ask how our world might change if more women took our professed ideals and values more seriously than we do keeping the secrets of powerful men.

Well, just as the cottages in a Thomas Kincade painting don\u0027t actually exist (has anyone ever seen glowing windows in the middle of the day?), neither do the communities of Beverly Lewis\u0027 imagination. These books reflect as much about Amish culture as the Little House on the Prairie TV show tells us about pioneer life. But is it all just harmless fluff and fun? Does it really matter since fiction is fiction, after all? Naomi and Rebecca join a few friends to discuss the impact of these books on the lives of actual Amish women and the material harm it does to romanticize a culture as they do.

These are the kinds of questions many mothers face as they consider college and/or joining the workforce. We respond to a listener question about navigating the guilt that is often heaped upon mothers who break the family tradition of being a stay-at-home mom. We reflect on our own experiences with childcare while acknowledging the irony of hesitating to ask for childcare when we\u0027ve been providers ourselves. We unpack some of the challenges that come with making the best choices for our children while pointing out how broader gender norms and social policies shape the limited options available to American parents. (Warning: It gets a little punchy!) In the long run, arbitrary rules and cultural prejudices won\u0027t keep children safe; children thrive when they have curious, connected, and fulfilled parents.

It may seem that Wisconsin vs. Yoder was a major win for the Amish since today 85-90% of Amish young people continue in the tradition and the Old Order population doubles nearly every twenty years. However, in this episode, Naomi and Rebecca take a closer look at the realities of Amish life more than half a century out from that landmark Supreme Court decision. They find that banning formal high school education not only sabotages the lives of young people who leave (as was intended), but it also shortchanges the lives of those who stay.

The reality that Amish teens are prevented from attending high school has been supported by broader American society for more than fifty years\u2013and is often even romanticized as a cultural norm to celebrate. Yet how is this situation possible at a time when education is so crucial to becoming an employable adult? In this episode, Naomi and Rebecca discuss the internal contradictions and inconsistent logic of Wisconsin vs. Yoder, the 1972 Supreme Court decision that exempted youth in Amish (as well as in Amish Mennonite, Old Order Mennonite, and conservative Mennonite) communities from formal schooling beyond eighth grade.
