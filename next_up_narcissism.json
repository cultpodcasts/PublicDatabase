      "description": "Fawning isn\u2019t a flaw to fix. It is a brilliant survival response that can quietly shape your entire identity until you finally have the words for it. In this episode, I sit down with clinical psychologist and author Ingrid Clayton for a conversation that I know will resonate deeply with so many of you. We talk about fawning, what it is, how it shows up, and why it\u2019s so often misunderstood. If you\u2019ve ever felt like you disappeared in a relationship or lost touch with your own needs just to keep someone else happy, you\u2019re not alone. And chances are, your nervous system was doing exactly what it needed to do to keep you safe. Ingrid shares her own story as a survivor of complex trauma, and how that experience shaped the work she does now. We explore the difference between trauma that\u2019s tied to a single event and the kind that builds over time in ways that can be hard to name. We talk about what healing actually looks like, how to start reconnecting with yourself, how to recognize the patterns that no longer serve you, and how to hold space for the grief that sometimes comes with change. This isn\u2019t a conversation filled with quick fixes or five-step plans. It\u2019s honest and validating. If you\u2019ve ever asked yourself, \u201CWhy do I keep doing this?\u201D or \u201CWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201D I hope this episode helps you see that nothing about you is broken. There\u2019s a reason for the patterns. And there\u2019s also a way through.

      "description": "Coercive control is about trying to take away someone\u2019s autonomy and agency. It\u2019s a form of domestic abuse that is often misunderstood and frequently dismissed. In this replay episode, I sit down with the incredible Laura Richards\u2014renowned criminal behavioral analyst and expert on domestic violence\u2014to break it all down. Laura and I discuss the misuse of terms like \u201Cnarcissistic abuse\u201D and \u201Ctoxic relationships,\u201D and why getting the terminology right is critical. When these words are misapplied, it can cause real harm, making it harder for victims to recognize what\u2019s happening to them and for others to take it seriously. We also talk about the broader societal factors that allow domestic violence to persist and why these patterns are so deeply embedded. We take a closer look at high-profile cases like Gabby Petito and Lauren Dunne Astley to illustrate how coercive control plays out in real life and the devastating consequences it can have. Laura also sheds light on how the media often memorializes male perpetrators while subtly placing blame on victims, a pattern that continues to fuel dangerous misconceptions. Beyond analyzing the problem, Laura shares the incredible work she\u2019s doing to have coercive control legally recognized as a form of domestic abuse. She explains why advocacy, education, and legal reform are essential to protecting victims and shifting the way society understands domestic violence. This is an eye-opening conversation, and one I hope will help others recognize coercive control for what it is.

      "description": "Power and control shaped Diddy\u2019s rise, but did they also define a long-standing pattern of abuse? Emmy-winning journalist Mara S. Campo joins Dr. Z to unpack the allegations, the fallout, and what it means when survivors finally feel safe enough to speak out. Mara, a contributor to the docuseries \u201CFall of Diddy,\u201D shares what stood out most\u2014the sheer weight of the stories, the patterns that surfaced long before fame, and the emotional toll of confronting uncomfortable truths. How do we reconcile admiration for a cultural icon with the reality of horrific accusations? What happens when the image we once celebrated no longer holds up? This episode isn\u2019t just about Diddy. It\u2019s about the power dynamics that keep survivors silent, the fear that stops them from coming forward, and the cultural shift toward believing survivors. Quotes \u201CWhen I first read Cassie\u2019s lawsuit, I will say this is the worst civil suit I have ever read.\u201D (05:11 | Mara S. Campo) \u201CMy heart just breaks because I\u2019m thinking about how young this woman was at the time. And now, I\u2019m in my mid-40s, I\u2019m a mom. And I just think about where I was at that place in my life when I was her age.\u201D (08:44 | Mara S. Campo) \u201CI think a lot of times when we see these powerful men getting in trouble, people come forward with these awful allegations. Sometimes you have to wonder, was it the power in the money that maybe corrupted them or did that empower them to be able to behave in this way?\u201D (11:23 | Mara S. Campo) \u201CThere\u0027s kind of a grieving that takes place if you\u2019re someone who loved Bad Boy and everything that it stood for and everything that it brought to the world. And for me, personally, that has absolutely been the case because I grew up on Bad Boy.\u201D (23:15 | Mara S. Campo) \u201CIt\u2019s important not to discredit those who have the courage to come forward, to listen, to hear, and to really have a lot of compassion.\u201D (27:21 | Mara S. Campo) \u201CThe idea that there\u2019s a statute of limitations on sexual assault to me is bananas. There should not be a statute of limitations on sexual assault because it takes victims years to process, to feel empowered enough to confront their abuser.\u201D (31:10 | Mara S.

      "description": "Narcissists don\u2019t just take what they want\u2014they dismantle their targets in the process.\n\nIn this episode, Dr. Z welcomes filmmaker and author Mark Vicente to discuss the dark realities of narcissistic abuse and its psychological aftermath. Known for his work on HBO\u2019s  \u201CThe Vow\u201D and his upcoming documentary \u201CEmpathy Not Included: The Narcissist\u2019s Playbook,\u201D Mark sheds light on the manipulative behaviors of narcissists, the vulnerabilities they exploit, and the emotional fallout experienced by the survivors of their abuse. \n\nMark reflects on his personal journey of healing after being entangled with NXIVM, offering profound insight into how narcissists mirror their victims\u0027 deepest desires and vulnerabilities as a means to control them.  He also unpacks the chilling reality of how some narcissists knowingly cause harm\u2014and sometimes even revel in it.\n\nDr. Z and Mark touch on the broader implications of narcissism in society, from media manipulation to cultural denial of the harm narcissists can cause. Whether you\u2019re seeking to understand narcissistic abuse or rebuild after trauma, this episode offers a compassionate and empowering perspective.\n\nQuotes\n\u0022One of the things I learned as I began learning about what narcissism is and is not, I recognize that there was a certain place that people bumped up against. Most normal empathic people cannot imagine that these people exist.\u0022 (04:47 | Mark Vicente)\n\u201CThe thing about psychopaths that\u0027s so interesting is that they analyze us very unemotionally. and they learn about the way our data works, so to speak.\u0022 (16:15 | Mark Vicente)\n\u201CPeople sometimes can\u0027t tell, they think it\u0027s excitement and it is, but sometimes that excitement is tinged with fear and desperation. And I always say when you\u0027re in that state with somebody, especially at the beginning, run. Because your cognitive thinking is going offline.\u201D (20:26 | Mark Vicente)\n\u201CWhen you\u0027re mapping the mind of an insane person, it does damage to you. And when you\u0027re mapping a psychopath, it\u0027s very confusing. It starts to do a lot of bad things to you internally, psychologically.\u201D (26:11 | Mark Vicente)\n\nLinks\nConnect with Mark Vicente:\nhttps://www.markvicente.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/markvicente/\nhttps://x.com/markvicente\nhttps://www.empathynotincluded.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/empathynotincluded/\nPodcast: WTF is on my Mind?! https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/wtf-is-on-my-mind/id1646783869\nYouTube Channel https://www.youtube.com/@markvicente7\n\n\nConnect with Dr. Z:\nhttps://www.drjaimezuckerman.com/\nhttps://www.zgrouptherapy.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/dr.z_psychologist/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@dr.z_psychologist\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@DrJaimeZuckerman\n\nGet my FREE breathing exercise here: http://www.drjaimezuckerman.com/newsletter\nRegister for my on demand virtual courses here: http://www.drjaimezuckerman.com/workshops\nOrder my workbooks! *Find Your Calm / Find Good Habits* http://www.drjaimezuckerman.com/books\nShop my new Mindfully Messy hoodie here: http://www.drjaimezuckerman.com/apparel\n\n\nPodcast production and show notes provided by HiveCast.fm\n---\n\nDr. Jaime Zuckerman is a licensed clinical psychologist and national expert in narcissistic abuse.

      "description": "\u201CThe narcissist will never be able to fix their corrupt disorder. It is a rigid disorder,\u201D says Vanessa Reiser, a licensed clinical social worker and author who specializes in narcissistic and cult abuse. She joins Dr. Z to talk about the striking similarities between narcissistic relationships and cult dynamics, focusing on how coercive control plays a role in both. Drawing from her own life experiences and professional background, Vanessa shares insights from her book \u201CNarcissistic Abuse: A Therapist\u2019s Guide to Identifying, Escaping, and Healing from Toxic and Manipulative People.\u201D She breaks down how narcissists deploy tactics like gaslighting, isolating their victims, and enlisting enablers (often called \u201Cflying monkeys\u201D) to keep control. But how does this connect to cult-like dynamics? Vanessa explains that these methods work by stripping away a person\u2019s identity that will trap them in a mental prison that\u2019s just as damaging as the control seen in actual cults. This episode reminds listeners of the resilience required to break free from these toxic environments and the importance of building supportive relationships that will help individuals reclaim their identities. Vanessa\u2019s insights offer valuable tools and strategies for overcoming these challenges that encourage listeners to seek help and validation as they move toward healing and self-empowerment. Quotes \u201CA real cult is always led by somebody who\u2019s trying to control, groom, and manipulate others to get supply and attention. We see this in intimate relationships and families. What they\u2019re doing is using the classic tactics of narcissists to manipulate others to do what they want. They will isolate and get you to basically only view their opinions.\u201D (05:01 | Vanessa Reiser) \u201CThere\u2019s this misconception that people who get sucked into \u2018these cults\u2019\u2014whether it\u2019s a cult of one, within a family system, or on a larger scale hiding behind a religious organization\u2014have low self-esteem or no backbone. That\u2019s not true\u2026 It\u2019s important for people to understand that it has nothing to do with intelligence. The myth that you\u2019re a weak person comes from the fact that once you\u2019re in this cult\u2014whether it\u2019s a cult of one or something larger\u2014the whole point is to gain control and power over you. And with that comes the loss of self-identity.\u201D (07:48 | Dr. Z) \u201CA narcissist will never be able to fix their corrupt disorder. It is a rigid disorder.\u201D (16:49 | Vanessa Reiser) \u201CA narcissist is allergic to your power and autonomy. They want to groom you and keep you ignorant, unaware, and not in the know.\u201D (36:25 | Vanessa Reiser) Links Connect with Vanessa Reiser: https://www.facebook.com/vanessa.pugliese https://www.instagram.com/vanessareiserlcsw/ https://x.com/vanessareisersw https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrYVROGoPdYqsEFkr2XYC9A https://amzn.to/3XPf9ad Connect with Dr. Z: https://www.drjaimezuckerman.com/ https://www.zgrouptherapy.com/ https://www.instagram.com/dr.z_psychologist/ https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.z_psychologist Shop my new Mindfully Messy hoodie here: http://www.drjaimezuckerman.com/apparel Get my FREE breathing exercise here: http://www.drjaimezuckerman.com/newsletter Register for my virtual workshops here: http://www.drjaimezuckerman.com/workshops Order my workbooks! http://www.drjaimezuckerman.com/books Podcast production and show notes provided by HiveCast.fm",
