The Zizians, led by Jack \u0027Ziz\u0027 LaSota, were once just a fringe group, but recent events have brought them back into the spotlight. With shocking arrests, a deadly shootout, and new charges tied to multiple crimes, this story is still unfolding. Let\u2019s take a deep dive into one of the strangest and most disturbing cases to come out of the rationalist movement.\n\nSources: \nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy83958r2d0o\n\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/18/judge-orders-leaders-of-cult-like-zizian-group-to-be-held-without-bail\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/delirious-violent-impossible-true-story-zizians/\n\nhttps://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/a-timeline-of-cultlike-zizian-group-tied-to-killing-of-a-border-patrol-agent-in-vermont\n\nhttps://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/a-timeline-of-cultlike-zizian-group-tied-to-killing-of-a-border-patrol-agent-in-vermont\n\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/zizian-murders-david-maland-curtis-lind-b2701101.html\n\nIf I occasionally misgender the people in this case, I apologise, it is completely accidental and unintentional.\n\nPlease note that this video is intended for entertainment purposes only.
