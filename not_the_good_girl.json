They beamed a message of faith and prosperity into millions of living rooms every night. They promised their viewers heavenly rewards and earthly riches if they would just donate to them; and they donated in mass... Together, Jim and Tammy Faye built an empire of $240 million a year\u2026 They purchased three homes, owned multiple cars and limos, spent $2,000 a month on electricity to heat their swimming pools, and even built a giant Christian theme park to rival Disney.
