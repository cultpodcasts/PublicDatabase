      "description": "Church, cat rescue, doomsday cult? AND B@@bs?! Tighten your seatbelts, you\u2019re in for a bumpy ride with this episode! Ballerina and ballet teacher, Oph\u00E9lia Martin-Weber is back as co-host and we\u2019ll be riding with internet trolls who I guess are disappointed that their internet search delivered videos of non-pornified breastfeeding moms? Leaning into their mockery produced laughable results and good times. What is it like being the daughter of the founder of The Leaky B@@b online lactation support and a lactation educator who talks about chesty topics every day? I interviewed Oph\u00E9lia with her personal experiences growing up surrounded by t*ttee talk all the time and her experience with ballet, breasts, and social pressures. Exploring body image.
