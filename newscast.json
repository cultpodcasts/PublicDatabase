      "description": "Today, we discuss the allegations made in Virginia Giuffre\u2019s memoir against Prince Andrew. Virginia Giuffre passed away in April after taking her own life, but finished writing the book before her death. The book goes into detail about the allegations she has made against Jeffrey Epstein, Prince Andrew and Ghislaine Maxwell. Prince Andrew denies all of the allegations made against him, but gave up his royal titles on Friday. What does Giuffre say in the book, and how have the Royal Family responded? Adam is joined in the studio with BBC Newsnight presenter Victoria Derbyshire, and BBC royal correspondent Daniela Relph. You can now listen to Newscast on a smart speaker.
