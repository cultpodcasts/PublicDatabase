      "description": "Record #1: Cult #1, Berkeley, CA Berkeley, 2001. I was twenty-something, restless, and aching for spiritual direction when I drove eight hours through the night to knock on a tantric yoga teacher\u0027s door. He told me I needed to do something extraordinary to prove my devotion. So I showed up in the fog at midnight. This is the record of a tantric yoga community in the Berkeley Hills led by a teacher who claimed lineage with Swami Satyananda Saraswati and Swami Niranjanananda Saraswati at the Bihar School of Yoga in India\u2014gurus who had never heard of him. It was a community where beautiful, devoted women enforced the hierarchy. Where silence was considered devotion. Where questioning was spiritual immaturity. Where sexual abuse was disguised as sacred tantric \u0022practice.\u0022 I thought I was choosing spiritual freedom and transformation. I was choosing erasure. This is my origin story\u2014why I recognize cult patterns and manipulation in yoga communities so clearly now. Why I can\u0027t be gaslit by institutional yoga\u0027s accountability theater. Why I understood exactly what was happening when abuse allegations against Pattabhi Jois became public. Why I left Ashtanga yoga when so many others couldn\u0027t. Years later, the truth emerged: the teacher had been raping one of his students for years. There were lawsuits. Whispers of women drugged. A pregnant woman. He eventually fled to Thailand. Had I pleased him with the fish dinner I cooked that night, I would have lived in that house. I would have shared her fate. I walked in hungry. I left dangerous. This is Record #1: Cult #1 Content Warning: This episode contains detailed descriptions of sexual coercion, spiritual manipulation, and abuse within a tantric yoga community.

      "title": "The Myth Of The Balanced Woman",
      "description": "We\u2019re told that the goal of a \u201Cgood life\u201D is balance. Balance between work and family, activism and self-care, health and relationships. But what if balance isn\u2019t real? What if the myth of the balanced woman is actually a trap designed to keep us exhausted, ashamed, and profitable to a system that was never built to support us?\nIn this episode of Spiritual Autopsy, I unpack how \u201Cbalance\u201D has been sold as control: eat perfectly, work out perfectly, manage your stress, stay calm, never tip too far. Through the lens of Ayurveda, I explore why balance isn\u2019t a static state but a living relationship with change. Change that moves with seasons, hormones, emotions, and cycles.\nAbout Magnolia Zuniga:\n Magnolia Zuniga is a former Ashtanga yoga teacher and one of only 20 women worldwide who were certified by the K.
