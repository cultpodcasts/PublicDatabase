This documentary, Lisa Mcpherson, Going Clear and Leah Remini all led to me doing this very podcast. For me and many others speaking against the methods, pain and the destruction of Scientology...it starts with John Sweeney.\n\nAlso, Clearwater does right by it\u0027s residents and my odd visit to the Orlando Scientology Org. \n\nDid John know just how aggressive Tommy Davis would be? Was Scientology cause for more PTSD than being behind enemy lines under cover?
