Lori has done everything short of AtoE steps (A long and arguous expensive process of reindoctrination and admittance of wrong doing, which didn\u0027t happen, to establish a connection again. It\u0027s also quite expensive) to establish a reconnection with the family she never wanted to lose. Lori didn\u0027t make them choose as she has unconditional love for her kids. The church made them choose, always conditions. \n\nHear what happened behind closed doors at Marty Rathbun\u0027s leading up to and after the Squirrelbusters came. It\u0027s something that adds more intriuging questions to the entire story between Jeremy\u0027s 3Million Dollar gag order and Marty\u0027s story.

We talk about how Scientology rates \u0022Gay\u0022 as being among the lowest of beings and how they tried to \u0022Audit\u0022 the gay away. Hear how the word \u0022Escaped\u0022 actually is the correct word and how far she would go after being convinced through punishment and auditing she didn\u0027t deserve to live. \n\nWhy was Nora considered a \u0022Unicorn\u0022? Marc Headley wrote a book about escaping Scientology that comes off like an action thriller, Will Nora\u0027s story convince you this is very plausible? Does Nora\u0027s story end at leaving?

Do people devalue one\u0027s pain over another based on experiences? Did Cathy ever get the Alien Sperm she needs for her new show?!\n\nFind out the answers to these questions and more on Come Get Sum Extra!!!\n\nAlso, Ex Top Scientologist turned Critic turned Critic of something he invented called the \u0022Anti Scientology Cult\u0022 turned David Miscavige Puppet Marty Rathbun has been shredding his former friends with lies and hateful indifference to their various horrific experiences in a series of boring cringe worthy videos. For the first time ever and without a net nor any personal knowledge of the man, I\u0027ll let my feelings on this fly uncensored with a special message for Marty!\n\nWhy am I of all people mad at this stranger? What message could I possibly have for him? and How far will I go? Will I stoop as low as Scientology hate speech? Will I name call and give them ammo?\u00A0\n\nHere\u0027s a hint: I don\u0027t give a F**k!!! Should be fun right!?\n\nSqueezemycans.com\n\n@squeezemycans",

      "description": "In August of last year I spoke to my first ex Scientologist Cathy Shenkelberg. She has been an Actress, Voice Actress and stage Actress but in this instance she was the every girl.Speaking with her made those things you wonder about much more clear and connected the dots. I thought after speaking to her I understood Scientology. I was wrong.\n\nCathy has been touring with her One Woman Show Squeeze My Cans since then and brought her show to Tampa FL. I finally got to see it.This is my brief review of that show!\n\nDid the show live up to expectations? Was there a dry eye in the room? Do I understand Scientology now?\n\nThe answer to these questions and more will be answered on this episode of Come Get Sum!!!!\n\nFollow Cathy on Twitter @SqueezeMyCans\n\nHellp Cathy\u0027s Hatch Fund:\u00A0http://www.hatchfund.org/fund/squeeze_my_funds_matchfund",
