      "description": "In this Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Season 15 ep7 gossip dump and recap, I\u0027m breaking down Amanda Frances responding to being called a scammer by multiple cast members with a bizarre money-filled car video\u2014plus I\u0027m exposing what her Money Mentality Makeover testimonials actually reveal and the shocking details of how she financed Kyle Richards\u0027 former home. Then we\u0027re getting into Rachel Zoe\u0027s new man Sasha Hart, a relationship coach giving me major red flags (and wait until you hear about Jennifer Aniston\u0027s boyfriend situation). Lisa Rinna just dropped a bombshell in her new book claiming Kyle and Lisa Vanderpump pushed her into the Yolanda Hadid Lyme disease storyline\u2014and I have my own tea about Kyle trying to do something similar with me back in the day. I\u0027m also revealing that Sophia Umansky, Nick Dubrow, and Mason Grammer are filming Next Gen LA together. In the episode recap, Kyle makes a heartbreaking confession about not feeling \u0022seen\u0022 by Mauricio and almost filing for divorce, Dorit makes some very interesting moves to get Mo\u0027s number with visible chemistry, and we watch Kyle emotionally break down returning to her old house where the good times ended. Plus the Amanda vs. Dorit drama explodes at the birthday party when Dorit suggests Amanda used her baby loss as a manipulation tactic\u2014and Kyle\u0027s already calling Amanda the new Crystal Minkoff. Stay until the end for my anti-inflammatory hot chocolate recipe!\n\nGet my other shows for $6.00 per month! https://www.patreon.com/cw/DishingDramaWithDanaWilkey\n\nTIME CODE HIGHLIGHTS:\n\u26A0\uFE0F 0:00 - Welcome \u002B cold weather update \u0026 son\u0027s flu on the anti-inflammatory diet journey\n\uD83D\uDEA9 1:02 - Rachel Zoe\u0027s new man Sasha Hart revealed - why relationship coaches are a red flag\n\uD83D\uDEA9 1:51 - Jennifer Aniston\u0027s boyfriend is also a life coach - when will these women learn?\n\uD83C\uDFAC 2:19 - Amanda Francis responds to scammer allegations with bizarre money-decorated car video\n\uD83D\uDCB0 5:50 - Breaking down Amanda\u0027s testimonials - why none of them make sense\n\uD83D\uDD0D 6:18 - Money Mentality Makeover exposed - what people are really saying about the course\n\uD83C\uDFE0 7:25 - Amanda Francis bought Kyle\u0027s house with massive debt - $4.8M mortgage \u002B $240K HELOC\n\uD83D\uDC60 8:09 - Sasha Hart explains why he became a relationship coach (red flag energy continues)\n\uD83D\uDCD6 10:05 - Lisa Rinna\u0027s book bombshell - claims Kyle and LVP made her go after Yolanda Hadid\n\uD83C\uDF75 10:17 - My personal tea: Kyle tried to do the same thing with ME against Lisa Vanderpump\n\uD83D\uDC94 11:09 - Yolanda\u0027s Lyme disease was real - David Foster allegedly convinced everyone she was faking\n\uD83D\uDCFA 12:08 - Sophia Umansky, Nick Dubrow \u0026 Mason Grammer filming Next Gen LA\n\uD83C\uDFAC 12:28 - RHOBH Episode Recap begins - Rachel Zoe \u0026 Erica Jane take Dorit\u0027s side\n\uD83D\uDC0D 12:47 - Kyle manipulating Amanda against Dorit - classic Kyle gameplay exposed\n\uD83D\uDC76 15:08 - Dorit claims Amanda used her baby loss as a \u0022block\u0022 - things get uncomfortable\n\uD83D\uDD2E 15:45 - Amanda Francis was in a CULT for two years?!\n\uD83D\uDE0F 15:59 - Dorit getting Mauricio\u0027s number - the chemistry and what it means for Kyle\n\uD83D\uDC94 13:44 - Kyle confesses she almost filed for divorce - doesn\u0027t feel \u0022seen\u0022 by Mauricio\n\uD83C\uDF0D 14:00 - Mauricio dropping his new UAE/Saudi Arabia agency on the show\n\uD83D\uDE22 16:45 - Kyle breaks down crying in her old house - when the good times really ended\n\uD83C\uDF82 18:37 - Dorit\u0027s birthday party - Amanda vs. Dorit showdown setup\n\u26A1 20:28 - Kyle says Amanda has \u0022Crystal Minkoff vibes\u0022 - ultra-conscious energy\n\uD83C\uDF6B 21:02 - Anti-inflammatory hot chocolate recipe - you\u0027re welcome! \n\n#rhobh #kylerichards #doritkemsley #wwhlbravo #bravotv #tmz #deux #danawilkey #decadishdana #decadish #kathyhilton #parishilton  #lisavanderpump #lisarinna #yolandahadid #suttonstracke #rachelzoe #jennifertilly #amandafrances #jenniferanistan #deniserichards #erikajayne #radioandy #jefflewislive #hayu #peacocktv #realitytv #gossip #bozsaintjohn #rachelzoe #crystalminkoff",

      "description": "Mary Cosby\u0027s cousin just dropped a TLC project allegedly exposing her lies I share the highlights, and Whitney Rose, Mary, and Bronwyn Newport triple down on camera with serious drug and alcohol accusations against Meredith Marks - they\u0027ve said this THREE TIMES which is huge. Bronwyn drops a bombshell about Seth Marks with a mysterious woman at a New York restaurant, but Meredith\u0027s social media claps back and Watch What Happens Live shade about Bronwyn\u0027s sealed criminal background reveals the battle lines. I\u0027ve got tea from Monica Garcia about a shocking Heather Gay ambulance incident involving alcohol poisoning that was allegedly covered up, plus why Lisa Barlow calling Brittani Bateman a liar backfired when Jared Osmond confirmed the truth.\nFor Members Only Palm Beach - you can\u0027t film on Palm Beach Island where real socialites live, so none of these women are actual queens. Taja Abitbol was accused in a 2022 arson lawsuit of setting a fire to land RHONY, though Jill Zarin defended her. Hillary Mooser married an 80-year-old at age 30 for her first of FIVE marriages, and my insider has tea about her properties. I believe Rosalyn Yellen\u0027s husband represents Mar-a-Lago explaining her Trump access, while Gail Brophy was removed by Secret Service trying to approach him and kicked out of Taja\u0027s viewing party. But the REAL Palm Beach queens? Everglades Club costs $300K to join, Eleanor Aquavela sells art for $120 million, and the Peltz family owns 13 acres worth $400 million - explaining Nicola Peltz\u0027s power over Brooklyn Beckham!\n\nFull episode only available at Dishing Drama Dana Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/cw/DishingDramaWithDanaWilkey\n\nTIME CODE HIGHLIGHTS:\n\uD83C\uDF89 0:00 - Happy New Year from Ireland - RHOSLC recap and Palm Beach deep dive\n\uD83D\uDC40 0:32 - Mary Cosby\u0027s cousin Dan TLC project exposing her lies\n\uD83D\uDE31 3:06 - Salt Lake recap begins - nine minutes of filler torture\n\uD83D\uDC8A 6:53 - Whitney, Mary \u0026 Bronwyn triple down - Meredith has drug/alcohol problem\n\uD83D\uDE2D 8:13 - Mary crying - outing Meredith forever on the show\n\uD83D\uDC94 9:59 - Bronwyn\u0027s bombshell - Seth Marks with mystery woman in NYC restaurant\n\uD83D\uDCF1 11:06 - Meredith\u0027s social media clap back - claims it\u0027s business partner\u0027s wife\n\uD83C\uDFAD 12:19 - Meredith\u0027s Watch What Happens Live shade about Bronwyn\u0027s criminal background\n\uD83D\uDE91 17:27 - Monica Garcia reveals Heather Gay ambulance alcohol poisoning coverup\n\uD83C\uDFAC 19:23 - Moving to Netflix Members Only Palm Beach secrets\n\uD83D\uDD25 20:17 - Palm Beach show background - originally Bravo\u0027s Snowbirds\n\uD83C\uDFDD\uFE0F 24:43 - Can\u0027t film on Palm Beach Island - none of these women are real queens\n\uD83D\uDD25 31:22 - Taja\u0027s arson scandal - 2022 lawsuit accused her of setting fire for RHONY\n\uD83D\uDC8D 41:10 - Hillary\u0027s gold digger past - married 80-year-old at age 30\n\uD83C\uDFDB\uFE0F 45:06 - Rosalyn\u0027s husband represents Mar-a-Lago theory explained\n\uD83D\uDEA8 46:59 - Gail removed by Secret Service trying to approach Trump\n\uD83C\uDF77 47:34 - Gail kicked out of Taja\u0027s viewing party for drinking\n\uD83D\uDC8E 1:00:17 - The REAL Palm Beach queens - Everglades Club revealed\n\uD83D\uDC51 1:04:21 - Pauline Pitt, Eleanor Aquavela, Sarah Wettenhall - actual royalty\n\uD83D\uDCB0 1:08:44 - Peltz family 13 acres worth $400M - Nicola\u0027s power over Brooklyn explainedClaude is AI and can make mistakes.
