      "title": "The Sullivanians: A group that went from Creativity to  Cult",
      "description": "Today\u0027s episode begins Thanksgiving Day three years after \u00A0 I became entangled with the\u00A0 Sullivanians a seemingly benign group\u00A0 that \u00A0 supported creativity but\u00A0 would morph into the singular cult that remained undetected on Manhattan Upper West Side.\n\nAnnie was my roommate and friend,\u00A0 but I on that day I began to realize her ardent belief in the Sullivanians as the vanguard party that would would soon shape\u00A0 the world\u0027s future was all encompassing. \u00A0 On that frigid day we found our way to a Greenwich Village cafe where Annie also openly discussed wrestling with the presence of her mother in the group.\u00A0 I\u0027d often\u00A0 thought of Maria as an older sister and\u00A0 Annie as the younger but going forward,\u00A0 her declaration left me in the murky waters of uncertainty. \u00A0\n\nThe episode doesn\u0027t end at the caf\u00E9, though. Learn why I was referred to a fourth therapist in three years and how I\u00A0 wind up at Reliable Lists, Inc and how I\u0027m guided by\u00A0 Stan Arnold, my new therapist, to become part of that office\u0027s union drive.\u00A0\n\n\u00A0The episode culminates in an emotionally charged farewell,, as Maria Alena departs for Sierra Leone. \u00A0 This\u00A0 episode carries you little further along my intertwining personal path, that\u00A0 eventually carved a way for me out of the Sullivanian cult and towards a new beginning.\n\n\nThe complete documentary Through a BlueWindow can be seen on my youtube channel shellfein1. I would love to hear your thoughts.\nThank you",

      "description": "In the 1970\u0027s, on Manhattan\u0027s upper west side, there existed a pyscho sexual therapy group known as the Sullivanian\u0027s  In later years characterized as a cult, the therapists advocated patients sleep with the therapists and cut off all contact with their families. Babies were forcibly taken from their mothers.  I was involved for five years. This is my story. (c) 2019 S. feinerman",
