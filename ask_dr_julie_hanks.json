      "description": "In this special episode of the Ask Dr. Julie Hanks Podcast I sit down with Kevin Franke, former husband of Ruby Franke from the 8 Passengers family vlog, as he shares his lived experience inside a high-control marriage and cult-like system connected to therapist Jodi Hildebrandt. During our conversation, Kevin speaks openly about how emotional vulnerability, religious culture, and misplaced trust created the conditions for manipulation, gaslighting, and isolation. Listen to understand how cult dynamics develop inside families, relationships, and belief systems, and why even intelligent, capable people can become trapped in these environments. Kevin Franke reflects on the rise and fall of 8 Passengers, his marriage to Ruby Franke, the psychological control exerted by Jodi Hildebrandt, and the devastating personal consequences that followed, including loss of identity, faith confusion, PTSD symptoms, and public scrutiny. He also shares what healing has looked like since leaving the system, rebuilding self-trust, reconnecting with safe relationships, and creating a life grounded in agency and emotional health.

      "description": "In this episode, I sit down with David Matheson, a former LDS conversion therapist who is now openly gay. You may recognize David from episode 1 of Bravo\u2019s Surviving Mormonism with Heather Gay. In our conversation, David opens up about his own experience as a client in conversion therapy, the harmful assumptions that shaped that world, and the moment he realized that no amount of effort would change his sexual orientation. We also talk about the tender complexity of mixed-orientation marriages, his personal coming-out process, and what he would say today to the clients he once tried to help in ways he now knows were damaging. If you\u2019re navigating your own faith expansion, supporting a loved one who has come out, or simply wanting to understand these experiences with more compassion, this episode offers a gentle, grounded space to listen and learn.

To top it off, her daughter has had a difficult time with her mother\u2019s decision to leave the Church. We discuss strategies\u2014like debriefing after church and staying in contact with her daughter\u2019s teachers\u2014that can help Saren and her daughter discuss spiritual matters while also keeping a pulse on what she is learning. This is a great opportunity for Saren to help her daughter develop skills like critical thinking, self trust, and sense of self. They are in different places spiritually, but that doesn\u2019t mean that they can\u2019t maintain a deep and genuine relationship. By being true to herself, Saren is modeling how to individualize spirituality and experience continual growth. Have you ever thought, \u201CI want to ask Dr. Julie Hanks a question\u201D?

She feels angry when she thinks about the time she lost living in a patriarchal marriage and sad when she thinks about her past self who didn\u2019t feel empowered. I invite Alyssa to allow herself to feel the anger that comes up when she thinks about what she lost. Pushing the anger away will only prolong her healing. No experience is wasted. There are opportunities Alyssa didn\u2019t have in a patriarchal marriage, and she also gained certain experiences during that time that help her to be who she is today. There are opportunities wasted, but the work that she has been doing is still meaningful. Caring for a home and family is meaningful work. And now she gets to do it consciously and with balance while building a life she loves. Have you ever thought, \u201CI want to ask Dr. Julie Hanks a question\u201D? Well, now\u2019s your chance!

I used to think that sustain meant agree, but I see the word differently now.

      "description": "In this episode I talk with Michelle and answer the question \u201CHow do I share my doubts about the LDS Church with my family?\u201D Michelle\u2019s parents are both very religious, and she is unsure how to share the news of her faith journey with them. Part of being honest about where you are on a faith journey is often disappointing your parents. This is especially hard for Michelle who has felt pressure to be one of her parents\u2019 children who stays in the faith. We talk about how she will lose that role in her family when she tells her parents, and that that will be sad. It\u2019s okay for her to grieve that role, and it\u2019s also okay for her to be true to herself. Have you ever thought, \u201CI want to ask Dr. Julie Hanks a question\u201D?

Her family has been accepting and supportive, but she has noticed they tend to be awkward and avoidant when her girlfriend is around. To Rebecca, it feels like she is being rejected. I ask Rebecca if there is room for people to be awkward around her and her partner without rejecting them. I invite her to recognize moments when she feels that awkwardness and allow room for other interpretations. I also encourage her to tell her family exactly what they could do when she is around to help her feel loved and celebrated.

Though she doesn\u2019t feel like she fits in, she has been looking for any possible way to stay. Tanya shares that she was taught she must be 100% in line with the Church or leave. I tell her that she gets to decide whether or not she wants to live that way. Who said that faith or Church involvement have to be an all-or-nothing matter? Part of growing up is taking ownership of your life. As you claim personal power for your life, you get to decide what and how you want to believe instead of relying on others to tell you what you should be doing or feeling. I also share that as Tonya gains confidence to live more authentically, she will start attracting more people who think like her.

Caregiving is valuable work, but the way the church presents it leads to an either or. During this episode, Dr. Hanks guides Hannah through reframing some of the messaging the LDS church has presented about idealizing motherhood, while also valuing caregiving as a legitimate vocation and life choice for men and women. Overall, who you are and how you live is the biggest way you can make an impact, and being bold about that wherever you have a sphere of influence.
