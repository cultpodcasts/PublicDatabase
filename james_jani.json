Malena Stark) - The Darkness Of The Light\n\n\n\n******\nThese companies follow a Multi-Level Marketing model, that means they often do not sell their products/services via retailers, but through a workforce of people sometimes called their \u201Cdistributors\u201D. This strategy is also often labelled as Network Marketing. \n\nExamples of these companies are: Herbalife, Amway, ACN, Younique, LuLaRoe, Arbonne, Beachbody, doTerra, Mary Kay, Nu Skin, etc. \n\nAlthough it seems ordinary on the surface, many of these companies have received a great amount of backlash, with entire communities built to oppose these companies (often labelled as the anti-mlm community). \n\nThe question here is: why the backlash? \n\nIn this video we dive into the industry and the reasoning behind the backlash, as well as the shady practices some MLM companies use in order to keep their distributors inside the company. \n\nSome of these practices include the selling of a \u201Cdream\u201D and promises of high returns, wealth, residual income, or \u201Cfinancial freedom\u201D if they join, whilst simultaneously promoting many self-help concepts. \n\nWe also take a look at what exactly a Pyramid Scheme is, how to spot one, and whether the accusations against network marketing companies are deserved. \n\nThe pursuit of wealth and financial freedom can often be consuming \u2013 the question is who out there is choosing to exploit these desires\u2026 \n\n\n******\n\uD83D\uDE4F Special thanks to everyone who agreed to be interviewed and helped me out for my research on this video. \n\nAlso big thank you to @rubensalsaa (on Instagram) for helping me sort through my research and the countless clips! \n\n******\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
