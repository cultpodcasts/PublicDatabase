Sarah and Andrea recount how they met many years ago and the similarities in their work with Munchausen and Munchausen adjacent stories. Sarah reveals a personal story about how she got into this line of work. Kaitlyn\u2019s Baby, is about a woman that had been serially fabricating pregnancies, contacting doulas, and once they had agreed to help, taking them through a series of escalating crises. Andrea and Sarah dive into the depth of emotional betrayal experienced by the victims in this case and the thrill of deception experienced by these perpetrators. Sarah talks about the lack of framework in the criminal justice system for someone who has not been physically harmed or cheated out of their money or property, as well as the complicated questions that arise for her as she investigates these cases. *** Listen to The Con: Kaitlyn\u2019s Baby: https://podcasts.apple.com/at/podcast/the-con-kaitlyns-baby/id1663956121 Order Andrea\u2019s book The Mother Next Door: Medicine, Deception, and Munchausen by Proxy .

      "description": "Mishelle describes her brother Collin as a vibrant little boy who loved to joke around and make people laugh. All of that changed, seemingly overnight. Sabrina and Mishelle walk Andrea through their memory of the timeline of Collin\u2019s symptoms, and his eventual diagnosis with NMO (Neuromyelitis Optica). This recounting of events exposes some discrepancies in the family\u2019s memory and Lisa\u2019s public story, as well as a rapid escalation in the medication given to Collin. We\u2019re introduced to Lisa\u2019s blog on CaringBridge, where she kept a detailed account of Collin\u2019s medical journey. She quickly begins referring to NMO as a fatal disease, even mentioning the possibility of hospice care. However, this portrayal is challenged by a pediatric neuroimmunologist we\u2019ll refer to as Dr. K, who specializes in NMO. Dr. K offers a clear explanation of what Neuromyelitis Optica is, the diagnostic criteria, and just how rare the condition is\u2014particularly in children. As suspicions grow within their tight-knit community and the family\u2019s financial support runs dry, the McDaniels relocate to Alabama to seek care from NMO expert Dr. Jayne Ness. *** Andrea\u2019s August 1st event with Gregg Olsen: https://www.libertybaybooks.com/event/west-sound-crime-con-2025-local-authors-gregg-olsen-and-andrea-dunlop Order Andrea\u0027s new book The Mother Next Door: Medicine, Deception, and Munchausen by Proxy .

They also explore a darker side of medicine\u2014where financial incentives might be shaping decisions more than patient outcomes and niche specialists become gatekeepers to high-risk surgeries. The conversation culminates in a whistleblower complaint that reveals systemic issues within the field. *** This podcast is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

      "description": "In the 4th part of our Case Files series on Rady Children\u2019s, Andrea and Dr. Mary Sanders from Stanford University deep dive into the emotional and legal complexities of child abuse cases. They unpack how surveillance in hospital settings\u2014while potentially life-saving\u2014raises big questions around privacy and consent. The conversation also explores the difficult dynamics of teenage victims, how hard these cases are to diagnose, and why the trust between parents and healthcare providers is often the first casualty.\n\nAndrea and Mary also examine how conspiracy theories infiltrate the courtroom and public opinion, warping our understanding of child welfare. From the strain on therapists to the trauma carried by kids in foster care and legal battles, this episode is a raw, thoughtful look at what happens when the system meant to protect children is itself under pressure.\n\n***\n\nThis podcast is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

This is Andrea\u2019s conversation with Chalice Howard, Sophie\u2019s friend of nearly 10 years.\u00A0\n\nWith many similarities, being white single moms of adoptive black daughters and a shared faith, Chalice and Sophie found a kinship with each other despite living on opposite sides of the country. Chalice shares about her relationship with Sophie and the girls, the journey to learning about and accepting what Sophie\u2019s been doing to C, and why she decided to contact Andrea. She describes how things came to a head with Sophie and gives a touching message to C and M.\n\n***\nPlease remember that this conversation is from Chalice\u2019s perspective and experience, so we are not able to fact check certain dates/times, nor her conversation with Sam. We have invited\u00A0 Sophie and other members of the Hartman family onto the podcast to tell their\u00A0 side of the story, but at the time of publishing have not received a response.. As always, the door remains open if Sophie or other members of the Hartman family would like to tell their version of events.\n\n***\nLinks and Resources:\n\nClick here to view our sponsors.

We\u2019re joined by Dr. James Hamilton, an MBP expert with a PhD in clinical psychology, to walk us through some of Sophie\u2019s most chilling journal entries collected in the case files. We also look at Sophie\u2019s disturbing internet search history during the time of C\u2019s alleged Central precocious puberty (CPP) diagnosis. After being separated from Sophie, M and C are placed with Sophie\u2019s mom and sister. Detective Lee discusses the problems that arise when placing children with people that are most likely going to side with the perpetrator. In April of 2022, C and M are returned to Sophie and criminal charges are subsequently dropped. Andrea offers a key insight into how this might have happened by revealing a surprising member of Sophie\u2019s legal team: her sister, Megan Carter. *** Links and Resources: Dr. James Hamilton: https://www.munchausensupport.com/who-we-are/ Check out Olivia LaVoice\u2019s podcast, The Bakersfield Three: https://www.iheart.com/podcast/867-the-bakersfield-three-128074552/ Learn more about our featured non-profit and mutual aid organizations: https://www.nobodyshouldbelieveme.com/nsbm-supports/ Check out You Probably Think This Story\u0027s About You: https://brittaniard.com/podcast Click here to view our sponsors.

But according to police interviews, very few people in C\u2019s orbit ever witnessed an episode, and if they did, they described symptoms that, alone, are not indicative of AHC. We also hear snippets of interviews stating that Sophie often presented AHC as a terminal illness, a claim that Dr. Zupanc refutes. Dr. Jill Glick, a child abuse pediatrician from the University of Chicago, returns to talk us through the process hospitals go through when evaluating medical child abuse cases.

      "description": "In 2020, the Hartmans grow even more isolated as Covid hits: Sophie pulls C out of school citing worsening health and breaks with the church community who\u2019ve been supporting her and her daughters. Concerns for abuse grow as Sophie begins to push a new narrative that C has central precocious puberty (CPP), a condition that causes the body to go through puberty prematurely, After making an initial DCF report in 2019 and tracking Sophie\u2019s demands for increasingly invasive procedures: Seattle Children\u2019s Child Abuse Team files an official report to the Department of Children, Youth, and Families. Her daughters are subsequently placed in protective custody and Sophie is charged with assault of a child in the second degree. We hear from the Seattle reporter who broke the story, Olivia LaVoice and dig into the extensive documentation from the investigation with Detective Michael Lee, a major crimes detective in Texas and co-founder of the National Crimes Against Children Investigators Association.. Andrea also talks with Dr. Mary Zupanc, a pediatric neurologist and epilepsy specialist with over 30 years of clinical and research experience with AHC. She gives listeners a better understanding of AHC by describing the history of the disorder, the various symptoms, common environmental triggers, and how clinical diagnoses of AHC are made. *** Links and Resources: More about Dr. Mary Zupanc: https://www.childneurologysociety.org/awards/mary-l-zupanc-md/ Check out Olivia LaVoice\u2019s podcast, The Bakersfield Three: https://www.iheart.com/podcast/867-the-bakersfield-three-128074552/ Chad Goller-Sojourner\u2019s Sitting in Circles with Rich White Girls: Memoir of a Bulimic Black Boy will be adding show dates in spring 2025.

      "description": "From corporate sponsorships to fundraisers large and small, Sophie Hartman was an expert at raising money for C\u2019s various medical devices, mobility aids, and specialized treatments. But were any of these things actually needed? We hear audio from the police interviews of Sophie\u2019s next door neighbors and a school aide who note that they rarely saw C in her wheelchair. We also take a closer look at C\u2019s diagnoses with friend-of -the-show (our not-so-secret Florida doctor) Dr. Bex, joins us briefly to explain the process that pediatricians go through to provide a clinical diagnosis to their patients. We take a closer look at the narrative Sophie weaves on Instagram, documenting her daughter C\u2019s medical journey on both her personal account and where she posts relentlessly about C\u2019s health and includes pictures of her G-Tube and Cecostomy Tube. We listen to reports from both Sophie\u2019s mother and father stating that C had no trouble eating by mouth, and we\u2019re joined by Dr. Jill Glick, a Child Abuse Pediatrician from the University of Chicago, who explains why a child who can eat normally but still has a G-Tube, as requested by a parent, is incredibly troubling. *** Links and Resources: More about Dr. Jill Glick: https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/jill-c-glick Preorder Andrea and Mike\u2019s new book The Mother Next Door: Medicine, Deception, and Munchausen by Proxy Catch Andrea and Mike at their Seattle Book Launch Event: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrea-dunlop-and-mike-weber-the-mother-next-door-tickets-1097661478029 Learn more about our featured non-profit and mutual aid organizations: https://www.nobodyshouldbelieveme.com/nsbm-supports/ Check out You Probably Think This Story\u0027s About You: https://brittaniard.com/podcast Click here to view our sponsors.

Just three days after C\u2019s third birthday, she is diagnosed with Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood (AHC), a rare, one-in-a-million neurological disorder. Simultaneously, Sophie enrolls her older daughter, M, in an elite gymnastics program. We speak to some of the moms who knew Sophie from the gym to get a better picture of Sophie and the two girls. They reveal a picture of a woman who, despite seeming to move from one crisis to the next, is somehow caring for a medically fragile child, nurturing an aspiring Olympian and financing all of this without a job or a partner. *** Links and Resources: Chad Goller-Sojourner\u2019s Sitting in Circles with Rich White Girls: Memoir of a Bulimic Black Boy will be adding show dates in spring 2025.

From claiming that adopting a child from Zambia was God\u2019s path for her life to allegedly performing an exorcism, Sophie\u2019s faith is an integral part of this case. We hear from Dr. Lauren Turek, an Associate Professor of History at Trinity University in San Antonio, TX and author of To Bring the Good News to All Nations: Evangelical Influence on Human Rights and U.S. Foreign Relations, gives us a context about Evangelical Christianity in the US and abroad and helps us understand Sophie\u2019s religious upbringing and worldview. Andrea is then joined by some of the Nobody Should Believe Me team: Senior Producer Myrriah Gossett and Lead Researcher/Producer Erin Ajayi to attempt to fill in the many blanks left by Sophie\u2019s memoir about her time in Zambia. The three of them lay out a timeline leading up to Sophie\u2019s adoptions of M and C, while at the same time examining the series of omissions and half-truths riddling Sophie\u2019s story. *** Links and Resources: Learn more about Dr. Lauren Turek: https://laurenturek.com/ Preorder Andrea and Mike\u2019s new book The Mother Next Door: Medicine, Deception, and Munchausen by Proxy Catch Andrea and Mike at their Seattle Book Launch Event: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrea-dunlop-and-mike-weber-the-mother-next-door-tickets-1097661478029 Click here to view our sponsors.

      "description": "In the second episode of Andrea\u2019s coverage of the Jesika Jones case, she\u2019s joined by Derek Jones, Jesika\u2019s then-husband. Derek bravely tells the story of how he and Jesika met, their home life, and the decline in their daughter\u0027s health. Talking to Derek gives listeners insight into the manipulative nature of perpetrators, not only with their victims, but also with everyone around them, and the mental toll of coming to terms with such a monumental breach of trust. Stay tuned for part 2 of their conversation, coming next week. *** Links/Resources: Preorder Andrea and Mike\u2019s new book The Mother Next Door: Medicine, Deception, and Munchausen by Proxy Click here to view our sponsors.

      "description": "While the Nobody Should Believe Me team is hard at work on season 5, we\u2019re revisiting the first episode of our third season, which covered the Kowalski v Johns Hopkins All Children\u0027s trial, also known as the Take Care of Maya Case. Next week, we have a brand new miniseries coming to your ears, so stay tuned. *** As the Maya Kowalski case heads to trial, we dig into the massive trove of documents about this case and begin to unpack what we know about what really happened during Maya Kowalski\u2019s fateful stay at Johns Hopkins All Childrens in October 2016. The Netflix documentary about the case\u2014and the prevailing media narrative---would have you believe that Maya was ripped from her parents by a corrupt system, and that this could happen to any parent of a sick child. But did Maya really have a deadly disease for which she required the massive amounts of ketamine and other drugs she was being given? Was the hospital unfairly biased against Beata Kowalski because she was difficult, or was something more sinister at play? We talk to national law enforcement expert on medical child abuse, Detective Mike Weber, as well as a Florida pediatrician who helps us unravel some of the myriad strange details about Maya\u2019s medical history. The beginning of our multi-part deep dive into the case reveals the shocking events that led up to the family separation. *** Links/Resources: Join Patreon for a look at Andrea and Dr. Bex\u2019s previous coverage of the Kowalski case: https://www.patreon.com/collection/548199 Preorder Andrea\u0027s new book The Mother Next Door: Medicine, Deception, and Munchausen by Proxy Click here to view our sponsors.

      "description": "Welcome to the first episode of Case Files, our new series for episodes between seasons! Andrea, either solo or joined by guests, will be taking listeners through additional Munchausen by Proxy cases, updates on previously covered cases, and the broader societal impact of this form of child abuse. In this conversation, Andrea and Dr. Bex (our secret Florida doctor friend from season 3) delve into the growing popularity of ketamine usage and the public perception of the role that it played in the Take Care of Maya case compared to the death of Friends actor Matthew Perry. After giving a quick overview of the Kowalski v Johns Hopkins trial and an update on the appeal, they discuss how ketamine was used in Maya Kowalski\u2019s treatment vs the current medical standard. Andrea and Dr. Bex then go on to recap and draw parallels to what happened to Matthew Perry. * * * Links/Resources: Join as a free Patreon member to listen to our interview with Ethen Shapiro about the appeal in Kowalski v Johns Hopkins All Children\u2019s: https://www.patreon.com/posts/kowalski-case-to-110897045 Preorder Andrea\u0027s new book The Mother Next Door: Medicine, Deception, and Munchausen by Proxy Click here to view our sponsors.

Everything about their history was suddenly cast in a new light: from the mysterious illnesses they\u2019d been plagued with since birth to the constant emergency room visits to the gaslighting from their mother. Now, years later, Jo returns to their small, rural hometown of Hutchinson, MN to try to put the pieces back together and help make sense of their traumatic childhood. Along the way, the story of Jordyn\u2019s life will be rewritten and their relationship with their mother takes a turn they never could have anticipated.

Finally, she tells Hope that if she really wants her family back, she should get treatment and offers to help her if she wants that.

      "description": "We take a look back at the third episode of the show. At the end of the episode, we catch up with Detective Mike Weber, friend of the show and expert in the investigation of Medical Child Abuse. *** Andrea speaks to Deanna Boyd, the crime reporter who broke the Hope Ybarra case and discovers that Hope\u0027s was one of many Munchausen By Proxy cases in Tarrant County that Deanna unearthed; all of which had flown under the radar. What\u0027s going on here? Why are there so many cases in this one area? As Andrea interviews Deanna and meets with Detective Mike Weber, as well as Dr. Jayme Coffman and Dr. Karen Shultz--two doctors involved with the Ybarra and many other MBP cases--she makes a chilling discovery. It\u0027s not that there are so many cases in Tarrant County, it\u0027s just that they\u0027re catching them. If the systems meant to protect children were functioning, every county would look like Tarrant. Andrea can only guess as to what truly went on behind the scenes in her own family\u0027s case, but she begins to grasp what the systems involved--CPS, the police, the doctors--are up against and why so many cases are destined to fail. Meanwhile, Andrea continues her maddening back-and-forth with Hope. * * * Follow Andrea on Instagram for behind-the-scenes photos: @andredunlop Buy Andrea\u0027s books here .

We explore how not only the Netflix film but a high-profile piece in New York Magazine rewrote the narrative of the Kowalski case and Dr. Smith\u2019s involvement to cast her as a villain. We unpack the stories of the four other families in the Netflix film\u2014featured as examples of \u201Cfalse allegations\u201D made by Dr. Smith\u2014and uncover the more complicated truth about what happened to the children involved. We hear from Dr. Smith about how the media has stoked outrage and real-life threats and harassment against her, her coworkers, and her family. We see the horrifying truth that what happened to Dr. Sally Smith could happen to any doctor in her position; looking at how the conspiracy theory of \u201Cmedical kidnapping\u201D is being constructed and affirmed by media on both sides of the political spectrum. *** Read Dyan Neary\u0027s New York Magazine piece here: https://www.thecut.com/article/child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy.html Watch the full video of John Stewart here: https://www.tiktok.com/@blind_gossip/video/7295142757612588334?_r=1\u0026_t=8gwrdSfC298 Records of the four families covered in the film here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FpSFjvX_8WB5cgPCI0E_cpXj1jaeVcC4?usp=sharing Munchausen Support accepts donations and volunteers at www.munchausensupport.com If you have a story about medical child abuse that you are ready to share you can tag @andreadunlop, email hello@nobodyshouldbelieveme.com or leave us a voicemail at (484) 768-0266 Follow host Andrea Dunlop on Instagram for behind-the-scenes photos: @andreadunlop Buy Andrea\u2019s books here .

Jo shares their personal story of revelations of abuse and recounts the emotional toll of constantly having to prove their own sickness. Andrea and Jo discuss the Maya Kowalski case and Jo provides insight into the parent-child dynamics, including the enmeshment, lack of boundaries, and parentification often seen in abusive situations. Andrea and Jo grapple with the complicated feelings around Maya\u0027s continued defense of her mother. Jo also opens up about how painful it is for survivors to hear their abuse erased and denied. They offer a message of validation and fight to other survivors struggling with self-doubt in the wake of this high-profile case. This is a thoughtful, nuanced discussion around the themes of voice, compassion, and the ripple effects of denying abuse. *** Munchausen Support accepts donations and volunteers at www.munchausensupport.com Click here to view our sponsors.

We take a deeper look at how entertainment reporter Caitlin Keating stumbled onto the story at her job at People Magazine, and despite her questionable grasp of medical child abuse issues, made a movie about a complicated case that was subsequently viewed by millions of people.

Shapiro unpacks how harmful the verdict is for healthcare providers now unsure about reporting potential abuse and explains why the media coverage of this case and others like it is asymmetrical warfare.

She examines why some mothers accused of medical child abuse are viewed as monsters and others as martyrs. Andrea looks at the charges against social worker Cathy Bedy the woman who became the face of the child welfare bureaucracy during the Maya Kowalski case and examines her testimony. We also seek out answers about the troubled state of child welfare in America by talking to Dr. Jessica Pryce, author of the forthcoming book Broken: Transforming Child Protective Services\u2014Notes of a Former Caseworker. Dr. Pryce shares heart-wrenching stories of mothers whose lives have been turned upside down by investigations and sets out a compelling and urgent case for an overhaul of CPS. With her inside view of the system, she also gives insight on how doctors and other mandated reporters can do the best for the families they want to help even within the current, deeply flawed system. This episode grapples with the complexity around reporting child abuse suspicions and the potentially chilling ripple effects of the explosive verdict in Kowalski v Johns Hopkins All Childrens. It examines the lack of support for struggling parents in America, while leaving the listener with urgent questions about justice and equity. *** Pre-order Dr. Jessica Pryce\u2019s book here: https://www.amazon.com/Broken-Transforming-Protective-Services_Notes-Caseworker/dp/0063036193 Learn more about Dr. Pryce\u2019s work on her website: https://jessicaprycephd.com/ Munchausen Support accepts donations and volunteers at www.munchausensupport.com If you have a story about medical child abuse that you are ready to share you can tag @andreadunlop, email hello@nobodyshouldbelieveme.com or leave us a voicemail at (484) 768-0266 Follow host Andrea Dunlop on Instagram for behind-the-scenes photos: @andreadunlop Buy Andrea\u2019s books here . *** Click here to view our sponsors.

      "description": "As we continue to process the far-reaching implications of the shocking verdict in the Kowalski case, we take a closer look at Maya Kowalski\u2019s testimony and what we know about her. She\u2019s emerged as a divisive figure in the case: alternately being cast as a brave heroine or as a manipulator. But given the evidence of her possible abuse and the questionable motives of the adults surrounding her, the truth is far more nuanced. We bring in survivor Jordyn Hope and child and adolescent psychiatrist Dr. Mary Sanders to help unpack the impact of trauma on memory and the aftereffects of medical child abuse. As Maya continues to be thrust into the spotlight for a role she didn\u2019t choose, we grapple with the outcome of what it could all mean for her. *** Munchausen Support accepts donations and volunteers at www.munhausensupport.com If you have a story about medical child abuse that you are ready to share you can tag @andreadunlop, email hello@nobodyshouldbelieveme.com or leave us a voicemail at (484) 768-0266 Follow host Andrea Dunlop on Instagram for behind-the-scenes photos: @andreadunlop Buy Andrea\u2019s books here .

After 9 weeks of testimony, the jury awarded the Kowalski family nearly $300 million in damages from Johns Hopkins All Children\u0027s Hospital. Bex shares her perspective as a pediatrician on how this verdict will impact the medical community and reporting of suspected child abuse cases. They discuss the implications for social workers and hospital staff who stood up and testified, and grapple with how the jury seemed to side with the emotional storytelling despite medical evidence. Andrea and Bex reflect on what this means for the U.S. justice system, mandatory reporting laws, and the public\u0027s willingness to accept that medical child abuse exists. *** Follow host Andrea Dunlop on Instagram for behind-the-scenes photos: @andreadunlop Buy Andrea\u2019s books here .

They analyze the dueling opening statements, consider what each side is likely to look for in jurors, and which of the charges\u2014if any\u2014might be most viable. Andrea shares insights on the lawyers after watching their interactions in court. She also weighs in on the extensive medical testimony so far, including a major revelation about the origins of Maya\u0027s controversial CRPS diagnosis. We also share a chilling account of Maya\u2019s ketamine coma that was shared in court via missives written by Beata herself. As both sides begin their closing arguments Andrea weighs the merits of what each side has told the jury and considers what the ramifications of the imminent verdict might be. *** To support the show, subscribe on Apple Podcast s or go to Patreon.com/NobodyShouldBelieveMe where you can listen to exclusive bonus content and access all episodes early and ad-free, including weekly recaps of the Kowalski trial.

Did Maya really have CRPS or was something else going on? With trial watchers choosing sides and digging in: what does the evidence actually tell us?

      "description": "In the flattened version of the Maya Kowalski story that has dominated the headlines, Beata Kowalski is a mother who fell prey to age-old biases against women. This story attaches itself to the well-documented reality that women are all too often not believed when it comes to their own pain, the stories of their own lives, and their professional opinions. Beata is cast as the martyr in Netflix\u2019s \u201CTake Care of Maya\u201D and two other women, Cathy Beady and Dr. Sally Smith, are cast as the villains. Today, we unpack the messy gender dynamics of this case. Cathy Beady is the social worker with a troubling past who\u2019s been accused of grooming and assaulting Maya Kowalski. What do we know about what happened during Maya\u2019s stay at Johns Hopkins All Childrens? Was Cathy Beady really hellbent on keeping Maya and Beata apart? Media coverage of the Maya Kowalski story has also done irreparable harm to the life and career of the respected doctor at the center of the controversy: child abuse pediatrician Sally Smith. She\u2019s been accused of violating HIPPA in a single-minded crusade to create a case against Beata Kowalski. But is there evidence that Dr. Smith did anything other than her job? Did she drive Beata to death as the film suggests or is it possible her interventions saved Maya Kowalski\u2019s life? As we break down the narratives and misinformation surrounding this case we get to the heart of the matter. The Kowalski legal team\u2019s claims that Munchausen by proxy is based on \u201Cjunk science\u201D and that Beata Kowalski wasn\u2019t guilty of medical child abuse because this form of abuse isn\u2019t even real. *** To support the show, subscribe on Apple Podcast s or go to Patreon.com/NobodyShouldBelieveMe where you can listen to exclusive bonus content and access all episodes early and ad-free, including weekly recaps of the Kowalski trial.

Beata Kowalski\u2019s tragic death by suicide in January of 2016 is at the center of the $220 million lawsuit Jack Kowalski has filed against Johns Hopkins All Childrens hospital. But did Beata really take her own life to free her daughter from the hospital keeping her captive as the plaintiff claims? As with everything in this story, the truth is much more complicated. The narrative told in the Netflix film \u201CTake Care of Maya\u201D is far from a complete picture of the harrowing series of events that led to Beata\u2019s death. In this episode we go through the police reports of the incident and various testimonies of those who were present to fill in the gaps of the days and hours leading up to Beata\u2019s death. We also examine the final court hearing Beata attended, which gives us a glimpse into where the case stood at the time of her death. *** To support the show, subscribe on Apple Podcast s or go to Patreon.com/NobodyShouldBelieveMe where you can listen to exclusive bonus content and access all episodes early and ad-free, including weekly recaps of the Kowalski trial.

Was Jack really just being pressured to throw his wife under the bus? Or did he have suspicions of his own about her? We also unpack some of the many discrepancies in Maya\u0027s medical history and the troubling behaviors of her mother Beata, showing that that this pattern of deceptive behavior went way beyond the question of whether her daughter\u2019s diagnosis of CRPS was correct or not As the Kowalski v Johns Hopkins All Children\u2019s trial unfolds in real time, we examine the facts of the case as they stood when Beata died and show how the prevailing media narrative about this case is getting it all wrong. *** To support the show, subscribe on Apple Podcast s or go to Patreon.com/NobodyShouldBelieveMe where you can listen to exclusive bonus content and access all episodes early and ad-free, including weekly recaps of the Kowalski trial.

      "description": "As the Maya Kowalski case heads to trial, we dig into the massive trove of documents about this case and begin to unpack what we know about what really happened during Maya Kowalski\u2019s fateful stay at Johns Hopkins All Childrens in October 2016. The Netflix documentary about the case\u2014and the prevailing media narrative---would have you believe that Maya was ripped from her parents by a corrupt system, and that this could happen to any parent of a sick child. But did Maya really have a deadly disease for which she required the massive amounts of ketamine and other drugs she was being given? Was the hospital unfairly biased against Beata Kowalski because she was difficult, or was something more sinister at play? We talk to national law enforcement expert on medical child abuse, Detective Mike Weber, as well as a Florida pediatrician who helps us unravel some of the myriad strange details about Maya\u2019s medical history. The beginning of our multi-part deep dive into the case reveals the shocking events that led up to the family separation. *** Follow host Andrea Dunlop on Instagram for behind-the-scenes photos: @andreadunlop Buy Andrea\u2019s books here .

We think NSBM listeners will be especially fascinated by his episodes on con artists and abnormal psychology. Our new season \u201CMaking Sense of Maya\u201D drops NEXT WEEK! Andrea and Jordan discuss: \u00B7 Munchausen syndrome by proxy (aka factitious disorder imposed on another): a form of medical child abuse where parents or caregivers fake or exaggerate their child\u2019s health problems for personal gain. \u00B7 How the widespread availability of medical information online, social media platforms, and crowdfunding has broadened the spectrum of people engaging in medical child abuse beyond professionals in the healthcare field. \u00B7 What the long-term psychological toll looks like for children who survive such abuse and how they struggle to discern the truth as they grow older. \u00B7 Why prosecution of medical child abuse cases is difficult when family courts may not thoroughly examine medical records and even accept a guilty parent or caregiver\u2019s word as fact. \u00B7 How we can keep an eye out for signs of medical child abuse, and who we should contact if we suspect the worst. \u00B7 And much more\u2026 *** Follow host Andrea Dunlop on Instagram for behind-the-scenes photos: @andreadunlop Buy Andrea\u2019s books here .

Despite the immense challenges she has faced, Alyssa shines as a beacon of intelligence, strength, and resilience. Her story is a testament to the capacity of the human spirit to overcome even the darkest of circumstances. During a visit to Fort Worth, we meet Alyssa: a smart, happy, athletic teenager who is starting her new after-school job later that day. Alyssa has found solace and normalcy after enduring so much at such a young age. Her determination to move forward and create a brighter future is truly inspiring. Alyssa shares her memories of the abuse she endured, the experience of testifying against her biological mother, and the profound impact it had on her life. Despite the pain, she remains steadfast in her commitment to fight for those who are voiceless, even testifying before the Texas State Legislature in support of a bill that bears her name. Alyssa opens up about her hopes and dreams for the future, revealing the strength and resilience she has found in her family. We also get an update on Brittany as Andrea shares some final thoughts for the season. *** Follow host Andrea Dunlop on Instagram for behind-the-scenes photos: @andreadunlop Buy Andrea\u2019s books here .

      "description": "In this gripping episode, we delve into the heart-wrenching account of Jordyn Hope, another survivor of medical child abuse. Taking a brief departure from Alyssa\u0027s story, we shine a spotlight on a far more common outcome for MBP survivors in which they are never successfully protected from their abuser. From a young age, Jordyn was led to believe they were a chronically ill child by their mother. Life-threatening asthma, organ removal attempts, and countless hospital visits became their horrific norm. But everything changed in 2018 when Jordyn stumbled upon the concept of Munchausen by Proxy during a community college class. Suddenly, the veil of deception was lifted, and the true extent of their mother\u0027s abusive behavior came into sharp focus. As we explore Jordyn\u0027s journey, we uncover the painful aftermath of confronting their mother\u0027s manipulation and the ongoing trauma they continue to navigate. Jordyn illuminates how the deep bond between victims and their parents often shapes their very perception of reality, leading to a harrowing and profoundly destabilizing road to recovery. Tragically, Jordyn\u0027s story exemplifies the most likely outcome of a medical child abuse case: one in which a perpetrator is never brought to justice despite the concerns and reports of numerous family members and medical professionals. Jordyn shines a light on the terrifying reality of Munchausen by Proxy and shows us a way forward for survivors both in their lived example and their own work to help others. *** Follow host Andrea Dunlop on Instagram for behind-the-scenes photos: @andreadunlop Buy Andrea\u2019s books here .

      "description": "In the wake of obtaining shocking public records about her sister\u2019s case, host Andrea Dunlop decides to divulge the details of the second investigation into her sister, Megan Carter. Seated alongside Detective Mike Webber, Andrea delves into the extensive documentation, and together the two unpack the devastating information about what reportedly happened to her niece. Despite video evidence, a successful separation test, and expert testimony from one of the most well-respected experts in the country, the juvenile court judge who reviewed the case returned custody of Megan\u2019s two children. Andrea remains deeply concerned that her niece and nephew are victims of a flawed system incapable of addressing the horrifying reality of medical child abuse and makes public the evidence against her sister as a last resort to protect them. During their discussion, Andrea and Mike also examine an irresponsible and misleading article about Megan\u2019s case published by NBC in collaboration with King 5, a local Seattle news outlet. In what has become a distressing pattern in media coverage of medical child abuse cases, this article attacks the doctor who reported the abuse and neglects to mention the evidence that made her do so. Meanwhile the judge\u2019s order that returned custody of the two children\u2014and on which the media\u2019s reporting appears to have relied\u2014contains shocking mistakes and untruths. Andrea talks to someone close to the case to set the record straight. The reporting in this episode is based on information in the public record.

Dawn Ferguson, the prosecutor on the case elucidates the challenges of convincing a jury that a mother could engage in such abuse against her own child. After six months of review and preparation, the legal team enters the courtroom armed with reams of eyewitness accounts and, most damningly, Brittany\u2019s grisly search history. Detective Mike Webber walks us through the complications of the trial and unpacks why the judicial system is not equipped to handle this form of abuse. Throughout the trial, the Waybourns strive to protect Alyssa but ultimately, the now seven-year-old girl has to take the stand to testify against her mother. *** Follow host Andrea Dunlop on Instagram for behind-the-scenes photos: @andreadunlop Buy Andrea\u0027s books here .

After a shocking incident pushed Heather to report Brittany to CPS, she was dismayed when no one intervened.

Brittany was always talking about her child\u2019s health issues, and complaining that she couldn\u2019t keep food down\u2014but it didn\u2019t add up with what people were seeing. Still, no one quite knew how to intervene. It didn\u2019t help that Brittany was a bulldozer, bullying anyone who disagreed with her and always causing maximum drama. Season 2 delves deep into a chilling case that exposes the shocking realities of Munchausen by Proxy and how it can show up. Unlike the charismatic manipulator in Season 1, Hope Ybarra, Brittany didn\u0027t need charm; she used force to get what she wanted. She wasn\u2019t fooling anyone, but it still felt like no one could stop her. *** Follow host Andrea Dunlop on Instagram for behind-the-scenes photos: @andreadunlop Buy Andrea\u0027s books here .

For years, Brittany lied about her daughter Alyssa\u2019s medical history and symptoms and subjected her to unnecessary medical procedures. Family members, healthcare providers, and even Child Protective Services knew something was wrong, but no one could figure out how to stop her. Detective Mike Weber, the lead investigator who helped put Hope Ybarra behind bars, is on the case once again; and we hear from more top experts in the field, family members, and survivors to help us understand the complexities of this abuse. Andrea will also reveal much more about her own family situation, unpacking the case against her sister that she touched on in Season 1.

      "description": "Andrea has made an intense connection with Hope Ybarra\u0027s family, and asked experts, doctors, and the detective so many of her burning questions about Munchausen by Proxy. But she\u0027s become increasingly fixated on talking to Hope herself as she comes to realize that it may be her only chance to get the insights she needs. In this stunning season one finale, Andrea travels to Mountain Home, Idaho, to meet with Hope Ybarra. In this intense, emotional back-and-forth, we hear straight from Hope what life is like for her after being released from prison. We find out what she\u0027s up to and what she hopes for from the future. Hope listens to her own family\u2014all of whom she\u0027s estranged from with the exception of Robin\u2014talk about what she was like before everything fell apart. She insists that she still loves her children, despite what she did. We see the human being behind the monstrous acts that splashed Hope\u0027s story across headlines and landed her in prison for a decade. Andrea asks Hope what might have been done to help her and what she might say to her younger self if she could go back. Finally, she tells Hope that if she really wants her family back, she should get treatment and offers to help her if she wants that. Hope is friendly and warm in person, but Andrea is left with the unsettling truth that she hasn\u0027t changed. * * * Follow Andrea on Instagram for behind-the-scenes photos: @andreadunlop Buy Andrea\u0027s books here .

At the end of the episode, we get a visit from very special guest, Erica Blake (then Handt), one of the sisters we interviewed almost 3 years ago. Andrea reconnects with her to chat about life since that interview. *** As Andrea contemplates what the future looks like for survivors of Munchausen by Proxy, she gets an unexpected message from two young women who\u2019ve lived it.

Liz and Erica Handt were taken from one terrifying situation to another when the foster mom who adopted them turns out to be abusive, telling the girls they had Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and dragging them from specialist to specialist.

What\u0027s going on here? Why are there so many cases in this one area? As Andrea interviews Deanna and meets with Detective Mike Weber, as well as Dr. Jayme Coffman and Dr. Karen Shultz--two doctors involved with the Ybarra and many other MBP cases--she makes a chilling discovery. It\u0027s not that there are so many cases in Tarrant County, it\u0027s just that they\u0027re catching them. If the systems meant to protect children were functioning, every county would look like Tarrant. Andrea can only guess as to what truly went on behind the scenes in her own family\u0027s case, but she begins to grasp what the systems involved--CPS, the police, the doctors--are up against and why so many cases are destined to fail. Meanwhile, Andrea continues her maddening back-and-forth with Hope. *** Follow Andrea on Instagram for behind-the-scenes photos: @andreadunlop Buy Andrea\u0027s books here .

      "description": "Novelist Andrea Dunlop is looking for answers. When her older sister was first investigated for Munchausen by Proxy abuse more than a decade ago, it tore her family apart. This catastrophic series of events sent Dunlop on a journey to understand this most taboo form of abuse. In this groundbreaking podcast, she talks to some of the top experts in the world to explore the criminology and psychopathology behind Munchausen by Proxy and to reveal the wide swath of destruction these perpetrators leave in their wake. Along the way, she becomes captivated by the case of Hope Ybarra: Dunlop speaks to those most familiar with the case, from the reporter who broke the story, to the detective who investigated it, to the family who lived through it. In the dramatic finale, she\u2019ll speak to Hope Ybarra herself.\u200B Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
