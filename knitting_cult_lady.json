      "description": "In this candid and wide-ranging conversation, Daniella Mestyanek Young unpacks how cult dynamics shape everyday life\u2014from the military to motherhood, from corporate jargon to childhood punishments over \u201Cscowling at the Word of God.\u201D She and Rebecca dig into the subtle and overt ways white supremacy trains white women into compliance and calls it safety. Daniella also breaks down the coded messages in American media\u2014including her darkly hilarious theory that Winnie the Pooh is a cult.\nThrough stories of her upbringing, military career, and anti-racism work, Daniella helps listeners understand how deeply entrenched programming operates\u2014and how to begin deconstructing it. The episode invites white women to stop waiting for a dramatic \u201Cbattle vs. brunch\u201D moment and instead get honest about the slow erosion of freedom already underway. Haley, the show\u2019s producer, also jumps in to share a disturbing moment that made them stop letting their son watch Winnie the Pooh, connecting racism in children\u2019s media to the broader themes of the episode.\nConnect with Rebecca at:\nThe White Woman Whisperer Website\n \nThe White Woman Whisperer Patreon\n \nThe White Woman Whisperer TikTok\n \nConnect with Daniella at:\nGo Fund Me for Publishing Culting of America: https://tr.ee/FTOBLyQnYo\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/4muxbu6 / @knittingcultladychat\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nCults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://sites.libsyn.com/534892/site\nWhite Women Get Ready: https://www.mistresssyndrome.com/book\n\nRebecca\u2019s Links: \nWebsite: https://www.whitewomanwhisperer.com/Cults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://tr.ee/IZBXVo667J\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/whitewomanwhisperer\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@white_woman_whisperer?_t=8nslhOSSy8g\u0026_r=1\nUnamerican Videobook: https://tr.ee/ODM-qtUJaR\nSecret Practice Videobook: https://tr.ee/DGEY3IeQQm\n\n\n\uD83D\uDD11 Key Takeaways\n\u25CF Privilege is most clearly understood when it\u2019s about something like eyesight\u2014something not politicized but deeply unequal in terms of access.\n\n\u25CF \u201CWinnie the Pooh is a cult\u201D: Each character in the Hundred Acre Wood mirrors a role in coercive systems\u2014Tigger as cult leader, Rabbit as enabler, Eeyore as the depressed second-gen scapegoat.\n\n\u25CF White women are often trained to wait for either \u0027brunch\u0027 or \u0027battle\u0027\u2014but this binary thinking ignores how authoritarianism creeps in quietly.\n\n\u25CF \u201CCotton-picking\u201D language still shows up in kids\u2019 media\u2014revealing how embedded racist ideologies are in even the most innocent-seeming content.\n\n\u25CF Resting bitch face, attitude policing, and productivity metrics are all part of controlling systems\u2014whether in cults, corporations, or culture.\n\n\u25CF The military is not a monolith: Daniella challenges assumptions about who serves, who gets platformed, and who gets believed.\n\n\u25CF Accountability means being wrong out loud\u2014and using your own moments of unlearning as tools for others.\n\n\u25CF The goal isn\u2019t just to de-center men or whiteness\u2014it\u2019s to center something better.\n\n \nChapters\n0:00 The Privilege of Vision\n07:10 Cultural Reflections on Perception and Behavior\n10:08 Media, Representation, and Racial Dynamics\n12:44 The Impact of Language and Cultural Narratives\n15:46 The Role of Authority and Leadership in Communities\n18:50 Brunch Culture and Social Activism\n21:22 Navigating White Privilege and Social Responsibility\n24:21 The Dynamics of Protest and Representation\n27:12 Emergent Strategies in Social Movements\n33:35 Awakening to Systemic Issues\n34:59 Preparing for Difficult Conversations\n37:18 The Military and Representation\n39:54 Understanding Power Dynamics\n41:46 The Role of Women in Patriarchy\n44:57 The Impact of Leadership on Perception\n46:39 Recognizing Patterns of Abuse\n49:14 The Importance of Acknowledging Mistakes\n52:25 Navigating Conversations on Identity\n55:19 Empathy and Understanding in Activism\n01:02:18 Understanding Neurodivergence and Personal Growth\n01:04:48 The Dynamics of Tough Love and Communication\n01:08:41 Attention as Currency in Social Dynamics\n01:11:44 Building Unique Markets and Personal Branding\n01:16:18 Navigating Identity and Societal Expectations\n01:19:31 Skills Acquired from Cult Experiences\n01:23:37 Resistance and Survival Skills in Adversity\n01:30:14 The Legacy of Cults and Historical Figures\n01:32:54 Patriarchy and Hierarchical Structures\n01:35:17 Surviving Trauma and the Importance of Community\n01:38:06 Understanding Human Experiences Across Cultures\n01:40:43 Navigating Power Dynamics in Conversations\n01:43:41 The Role of Privilege and Proof of Purpose\nProduced by Haley Phillips",

      "description": "In this revealing and emotionally rich episode of Cults and the Culting of America, Cynthia Williams joins hosts Scot Loyd and Daniella Mestyanek Young to unpack her journey through\u2014and out of\u2014the United Pentecostal Church International (UPCI). Cynthia shares how, like many others, she once believed that her local church was different. The rules were strict, yes, but they felt spiritually justified\u2014until the cracks began to show.\nAs Cynthia puts it, the realization came slowly: \u201CI think it\u0027s probably just in the last two years\u2026 that I finally was like, wait a minute, I think I was in a cult.\u201D That moment of clarity is a turning point in the episode, as the conversation explores how UPCI and similar groups protect themselves through plausible deniability. \u201CNot my church,\u201D people say\u2014oblivious or unwilling to confront the broader systemic harm. Cynthia describes how Bible college exposed her to both a deeper version of indoctrination and\u2014paradoxically\u2014the seeds of her exit. Through theology classes and critical thinking challenges, she began questioning the very doctrines that once gave her purpose. The episode also dives into her experience witnessing the tragic death of a teenage girl at Bible school\u2014a loss that the church quickly co-opted into a martyrdom narrative, silencing Cynthia\u2019s voice and rewriting the truth. Alongside moments of grief and spiritual disillusionment, the hosts discuss cult tactics like toxic positivity, spiritual bypassing, gendered control, and the recurring pattern of falling into other high-control environments even after leaving religion. From the military to corporate America, Cynthia\u2019s story traces how these systems echo one another\u2014and how healing requires naming those echoes for what they are. With warmth, honesty, and shared survivor wisdom, this episode is a candid look at what it means to say, \u201CMaybe it was my church after all.\u201D\n \nFor more info on me:\nGo Fund Me for Publishing Culting of America: https://tr.ee/FTOBLyQnYo\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/4muxbu6 / @knittingcultladychat\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nCults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://sites.libsyn.com/534892/site\n\nKey Take-Aways\n\u25CFRules varied by pastor but enforced absolute obedience, reinforcing the illusion of autonomy while maintaining tight control.\n\u25CFWomen were subjected to extreme modesty standards, with the specifics often shifting\u2014creating confusion and deep internalization of shame and obedience.\n\u25CFPlausible deniability (\u0022not my church\u0022) was used to disguise systemic problems across UPCI.\n\u25CFWomen in UPCI were expected to be either angelic \u201Csaints\u201D or demonized \u201CJezebels\u201D\u2014no in-between.\n\u25CFWomen showing independence or intellect were often ostracized or tightly policed.\n\u25CFCynthia\u2019s racial identity and outsider status gave her marginal freedom to step outside strict gender molds\u2014but also made her invisible in some ways.\n\u25CFBible school inadvertently helped Cynthia develop critical thinking, ultimately aiding her exit.\n\u25CFLeaving the group meant not just losing community, but also certainty, purpose, and a framework for meaning.\n\u25CFLike many ex-cult members, Cynthia found herself repeatedly drawn to similarly high-control environments even after leaving UPCI.\n\u25CFThe murder of a student Cynthia mentored was mishandled by the church, which spun the event into a martyrdom narrative\u2014silencing Cynthia and distorting the truth.\n\u25CFCynthia shares how old coping strategies like breaking into church songs still emerge under stress\u2014signs of deep conditioning and dissociation.\n\u25CFDaniella highlights the concept of being an \u201Cinvisible immigrant\u201D\u2014growing up in an insular religious world without cultural references or grounding in the outside world.\n\u25CFThey celebrate the comfort and solidarity found in the \u201Cex-cult sisterhood\u201D\u2014a chosen family of people who get it.\n\nChapters\n00:00 Introduction to Cult Experiences\n 03:10 Personal Journeys in the United Pentecostal Church\n 06:01 Expectations and Restrictions for Women\n 08:46 Identifying Cult-like Behaviors\n 11:54 The Role of Education in Cult Awareness\n 15:05 Navigating Gender Dynamics in Cults\n 17:45 The Impact of Nostalgia and Shared Experiences\n 20:59 Emotional Healing and Reflection\n 23:57 Coping with Life After Leaving a Cult\n 30:20 Revisiting Trauma and Dissociation\n 31:55 Toxic Positivity in High-Control Groups\n 34:14 Tragedy and Manipulation: The Church\u0027s Narrative\n 39:40 The Impact of Violence on Faith Communities\n 43:23 Identity Crisis After Leaving the Cult\n 50:07 Life After the Cult: Finding New Paths\nProduced by Haley Phillips",

One important thing to think about with this trail is how people in the real world are processing the way people respond to it\u2013 which is why the \u201Cwhy didn\u2019t they just leave?\u201D or \u201Cshe\u2019s only in it for the money\u201D rhetoric can be so dangerous. \nSomeone in your life might be in a similar situation and decide not to disclose abuse or confide in you if you engage in this kind of victim blaming, the more the public discourse continues in this manner, the harder it becomes for people to talk about this if it\u2019s happening to them.\nMia, one of the victims (this is her pseudonym) was asked about supportive messages she sent him and why she continued to interact with him, she said \u201CI was brainwashed\u201D\nWe know Diddy bribed hotel security to get his hands on the only copy of the video of him beating Cassie up as she tries to escape. \nLaura Richards, a criminal behavior analyst summed so much of this trial and issues around coercive control up so well when she said \u201Cwhen fear is present, consent is not.\u201D\n\nAustralia: Religious Sect Faces Scrutiny\nIn Queensland, a conservative Christian sect known as \u0022The Saints,\u0022 led by Brendan Stevens, is under investigation following the death of an eight-year-old girl who was denied insulin for her diabetes. The group, which rejects modern medicine in favor of faith healing, has been labeled a cult by critics.\n\nPalm Springs Fertility Clinic Bombing\nOn May 17, 2025, Guy Edward Bartkus, a 25-year-old self-described member of a \u0022pro-mortalist\u0022 death cult, detonated a car bomb outside the American Reproductive Centers in Palm Springs, California. The explosion killed Bartkus and injured four others. Prior to the attack, Bartkus posted a manifesto declaring war against pro-lifers and criticizing IVF as epitomizing \u0022pro-life ideology.\u0022 The FBI labeled the explosion an intentional act of terrorism.\n\n\u0027Cult of Body \u0026 Soul\u0027 Podcast Investigates SoulCycle\nA new podcast titled \u0022Cult of Body \u0026 Soul,\u0022 produced by Jess Rothschild, delves into the history of SoulCycle, the high-intensity indoor cycling brand. The podcast explores the brand\u0027s rise and examines its internal culture through interviews with former instructors, revealing stories of partying, drug use, and a culture bordering on the cultish.\n\n\nCULT of MAGA Updates: \nCulting of America updates: \nDone, Jan 20, chapters recorded soon \nEvents update\nPodcasts: \nBookclub: \nGOFUNDME:",

      "description": "This week on Cults and the Culting of America, we\u2019re turning the mic toward someone you all know well\u2014our beloved cohost, Scot Loyd. With no guest this episode, Daniella takes the opportunity to spotlight Scot\u2019s powerful personal journey and upcoming book, The God That I Was Given.\nIn an open and layered conversation, Scot reflects on his years inside the United Pentecostal Church, his rise to leadership, and what it meant to deconstruct the faith and ideologies that shaped him. He and Daniella discuss the gendered nature of cult experiences, the silence often expected of men, and how writing becomes both a weapon and a lifeline for survivors.\nThey also dig deep into the racist roots of Pentecostalism, the enduring myth of white Christian victimhood, and how cult dynamics echo through American politics today.\nWhether you\u2019ve been here since episode one or are just tuning in, this intimate episode offers a closer look at Scot\u2019s story and the broader systems of power so many of us are still trying to untangle.\nDaniella\u0027s Links:\nYou can read all about my story in my book, Uncultured-- buy signed copies here. https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\n \nFor more info on me:\nGo Fund Me for Publishing Culting of America: https://tr.ee/FTOBLyQnYo\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/4muxbu6 / @knittingcultladychat\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nCults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://sites.libsyn.com/534892/site\nWhite Women Get Ready: https://www.mistresssyndrome.com/book\n\nTakeaways\n\u25CF Even Survivors Can Be Complicit\n Scot reflects on how he not only endured harm within the United Pentecostal Church but also perpetuated it as a preacher and leader. His journey involves confronting both victimhood and complicity\u2014a nuanced look at accountability in high-control systems.\n\n\u25CF Patriarchy Shields Men from Cult Harm\u2014and From Speaking Out\n The conversation explores why fewer men write cult survivor memoirs: patriarchal systems often cushion men from the worst abuses and discourage emotional vulnerability, leaving their stories underrepresented.\n\n\u25CF Faith Deconstruction Is Not Bitterness\u2014It\u2019s Clarity\n Scot addresses the accusation that leaving high-control religion makes you \u201Cbitter.\u201D Drawing on biblical stories (like Naomi in Ruth), he reframes bitterness as a justified and even holy reaction to harm\u2014and a fuel for transformation.\n\n\u25CF Cults Mirror American Systems of Power\n The episode draws strong parallels between cult dynamics and systemic issues in the U.S., including white supremacy, evangelical nationalism, and the cult of personality around political figures like Donald Trump.\n\n\u25CF Telling the Truth Is a Radical Act\n Both hosts emphasize the importance of sharing honest, unvarnished stories to give future generations language and context for their own experiences\u2014and to challenge whitewashed versions of history.\n\n\u25CF The Tools Used to Indoctrinate Can Be Used to Liberate\n Scot talks about reclaiming the skills he developed in church\u2014preaching, writing, public speaking\u2014to critique the very systems that shaped him. Daniella echoes this with her own story, highlighting the healing power of storytelling.\n\n\u25CF Cult Experiences Are Strikingly Universal\n While each cult has its own doctrine or dogma, the episode highlights the common traits\u2014performance culture, black-and-white thinking, suppression of autonomy\u2014that unite cult survivors across backgrounds.\n\nChapters\n00:00 Introduction and Book Projects\n 03:26 Exploring Gender Perspectives in Cult Experiences\n 06:37 The Unraveling of Beliefs and Personal Reflection\n 09:27 The Role of Education in Leaving Cults\n 12:20 Writing as a Tool for Healing and Reflection\n 15:36 Navigating the Complexity of Cult Narratives\n 18:24 Confronting the Charge of Bitterness\n 21:17 The Power of Personal Stories in Cult Recovery\n 24:25 The Importance of Documenting Experiences for Future Generations\n 31:56 The Burden of Representation in Cults\n 35:18 Historical Narratives and Cultural Spin\n 39:56 The Roots of Pentecostalism and Racism\n 44:39 The Legacy of Racism in American Christianity\n 49:40 Cult of Personality vs. Cult of Ideas\n 56:11 The Current Political Climate and Its Cult-like Dynamics\n\nProduced by Haley Phillips",

They explore the historical context of cults, the role of fear and control, and the lasting impact of cult experiences on individuals. Through personal stories and reflections, the conversation highlights the intricate dynamics of cults and their cultural significance.

Rudnev, 57, had previously been sentenced to 11 years in a Siberian prison for rape and running a sex cult. He now faces fresh charges, including human trafficking, sexual exploitation, and drug offenses. Rudnev founded the Ashram Shambala cult in 1989, manipulating mostly female followers into surrendering their assets and engaging in coerced sexual rituals. The arrest was triggered by the discovery of a frightened and malnourished young pregnant Russian woman, sparking suspicions of abuse and underage involvement. \n\nBethany Joy Lenz\u0027s Memoir Resonates with Abuse Survivors \nActress Bethany Joy Lenz, known for her role on \u201COne Tree Hill,\u201D has been receiving daily messages from women in abusive relationships following the release of her memoir, \u201CDinner with Vampires.\u201D In the book, Lenz details her decade-long experience in a controlling religious cult while working on the hit TV series. Her candid revelations about emotional abuse and manipulation have resonated deeply with readers, empowering many to confront their own situations. \nSome of the Zizians have had court appearances related to their alleged crimes\nSFGate has a headline reading Zizians Bay Area court appearance descends into chaos which seems on brand for a group that tried to kill someone with a samurai sword.\nOne of the members of the cult who is transgender has been vocal about these trials being an effort to force her to detransition, which is interesting because she\u2019s right about the pervasiveness of antitrans thinking, but the crimes were real. Could be that Ziz took advantage of her reasonable fears and manipulated them. \nDallas observer has an article about Homestead Heretige, another case of a possible cult (but definitely fringe religious group) in plane sight. \nIt has a \u201Ccheese cave\u201D (a cheese aging facility) which is advertised with billboards along the highway. The have a bunch of attractions that give off a homesteady vibe for folks who want low commitment tradlife vibes for a day or so.\nAccording to the article, the group claims their attractions draw hundreds of thousands of visitors a year, which is possible but also we can\u2019t trust the numbers put out by a suspected cult. \n\nKNit picking",

They explore personal experiences with cults, the intersection of race and cults, and the societal responses to these groups. The discussion highlights the role of white women in these conversations, the importance of listening and learning from diverse experiences, and the manipulative tactics employed by cults. The speakers emphasize that conflict can be a necessary part of understanding and navigating these topics, and they advocate for a more nuanced approach to discussing race and identity within the context of cults. In this conversation, Daniella and Rebecca explore the complexities of racial discussions, the importance of asking questions, and the role of community in understanding different perspectives. They delve into the nuances of consumer privilege in content creation, the challenges of neurodiversity, and the impact of cultural practices on comfort and community. The discussion also touches on the significance of authenticity, self-reflection, and the dynamics of rebranding in personal and societal contexts.\nIn this episode of Cults and the Culting of America, hosts Scot Loyd and Daniella Mestyneck Young explore the current political climate in the U.S. and its parallels to cult dynamics. They discuss the rise of cult mentality, the deification of leaders, and the implications of executive power. The conversation emphasizes the importance of community, collective action, and the role of art in resisting oppressive governance. The hosts encourage listeners to engage with their communities and resist fear-driven narratives, highlighting the need for resilience and creativity in challenging times.\nSHiney happy trafficking \nThought terminating cliches \nWhere we see them\nHow they impact our relationships with people both in and out of cults\nHow to manage them when we encounter them \nTantric Yoga Guru\u2019s Exploitation in the UK\nThe Tara Yoga Centre in London and Oxford, led by Gregorian Bivolaru, has been exposed for manipulating members under the guise of Tantric yoga.

The discussion touches on themes of identity, race, and the struggles of belonging within high-control groups. They explore the dynamics of critical thinking versus apologetics in Christian education, the impact of the model minority myth, and the role of empathy in Christianity. Scott reflects on his experiences teaching at a Christian university and the challenges he faced while trying to foster a more inclusive environment. The conversation culminates in a discussion about the current state of Christianity and its intersection with social justice, as well as Scott\u0027s ongoing work in helping others navigate their own journeys out of high-control groups.\n\nScott Okamoto\u0027s Links:\nSubstack: https://substack.com/@rscottokamoto\nPodcast: https://dauntless.fm/podcast/chapelprobation\nBook: https://www.amazon.com/Asian-American-Apostate-Evangelical-University/dp/1957687134/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3QP6SE2AAI1T1\u0026dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.0p-xvXdpJMmt_FA1Q-HkqRgPCiXPDvPM3EppX46bKPjZUG4WpTESenEla-l9DYyxPCkDQnVJJ9qrLZSh4WZ_1uIDAGYESVjxRR79uaOQHpd06LPxG_h4e_0I3_m3H9l4L_lb_6sOrETyVNX4bpTSvQ.JIctlVaeieZomPYqV3T5eFblD6jkharPVN3lCXVwExo\u0026dib_tag=se\u0026keywords=asian\u002Bamerican\u002Bapostate\u0026qid=1736191778\u0026sprefix=asian\u002Bamerican\u002Bapostate%2Caps%2C226\u0026sr=8-1\n\nDaniella\u0027s Links:\nYou can read all about my story in my book, Uncultured-- buy signed copies here. https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\nFor more info on me:\nPatreon: https://bit.ly/YTPLanding\nCult book Clubs (Advanced AND Memoirs) Annual Membership: https://bit.ly/YTPLanding\nGet an autographed copy of my book, Uncultured: https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\nGet my book, Uncultured, from Bookshop.org: https://bit.ly/4g1Ufw8\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/3V6GK6k / KnittingCultLady\nInstagram:  https://bit.ly/4ePAOFK / daniellamyoung_ \nUnamerican video book (on Patreon): https://bit.ly/YTVideoBook\nSecret Practice video book (on Patreon): https://bit.ly/3ZswGY8\n\nOther Podcasts\nDaniella\u0027s other podcast: Hey White Women--https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp/\n\nTakeaways\nScott Okamoto shares his experience growing up in evangelical Christianity.\nThe conversation highlights the struggles of identity and belonging in high-control groups.\nCritical thinking is often stifled in Christian education, replaced by apologetics.\nThe model minority myth complicates the experiences of Asian Americans in evangelical spaces.\nEmpathy is lacking in contemporary Christianity, as evidenced by recent teachings.\nScott\u0027s journey out of evangelicalism was gradual, marked by many small realizations.\nInterpersonal relationships can be a significant barrier to leaving high-control groups.\nScott\u0027s current work focuses on helping others navigate their experiences in Christian schools.\nThe conversation draws parallels between cult dynamics and the tech industry.\nThe hosts emphasize the importance of questioning and critical engagement in all areas of life.\nChapters\n00:00 Introduction and Acknowledgment of Social Issues\n 01:55 Scott Okamoto\u0027s Journey in Evangelical Christianity\n 06:53 Struggles with Identity and Belonging\n 10:40 The Role of Argumentation in Cults and Christianity\n 15:13 Toxic Masculinity and Church Dynamics\n 18:24 Racial Dynamics in Christianity\n 23:44 The Model Minority Myth and Its Implications\n 30:03 Recognizing Our Place in the Movement\n 31:08 The Journey of Awakening\n 32:13 The Struggle with Faith and Reality\n 35:01 The Cop-Out of Prayer\n 36:28 The Politics of Panic\n 38:57 Interpersonal Relationships and Leaving the Church\n 40:05 Finding Community Beyond the Church\n 43:30 Empathy and the State of Christianity\n 44:44 The Podcast and the Book\n 52:41 The Cult of the Tech Industry\nProduced by Haley Phillips",

It is being propagated by a cult expert who is wrong about this. \n\nTo clarify: being transgender is an identity, NOT a cult. There can and are trans people in cults (like there can be cis people in cults), and in this case we have a trans cult leader. But trans identity is not a cult. \n\nAbout Me: \nI\u0027m Daniella Mestyanek Young, scholar of cults, extreme groups, and extremely bad leadership.

Taylor shares her experiences with an online cult, discussing the similarities between online and in-person cults, the recruitment tactics used, and the psychological manipulation involved. The conversation explores the dynamics of charismatic leadership, the exploitation of belonging and purpose, and the red flags that led to Taylor\u0027s eventual departure from the cult. The discussion also touches on the importance of healthy leadership and the potential for spiritual practices to exist without devolving into cult-like behavior. In this conversation, Taylor Marie shares her harrowing experience of being involved in a cult-like astrology group, detailing the emotional turmoil and moral conflicts she faced. She discusses the manipulative tactics of the cult leader, the fear of leaving, and the subsequent backlash she received after her departure. The conversation highlights the importance of questioning authority and the role of social media in exposing harmful groups. Taylor\u0027s journey of self-discovery and the impact on her family dynamics are also explored, culminating in a powerful narrative of resilience and personal growth.\n\nDaniella\u0027s Links:\nYou can read all about my story in my book, Uncultured-- buy signed copies here. https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\nFor more info on me:\nPatreon: https://bit.ly/YTPLanding\nGet an autographed copy of my book, Uncultured: https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\nGet my book, Uncultured, from Bookshop.org: https://bit.ly/4g1Ufw8\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/3V6GK6k / KnittingCultLady\nInstagram:  https://bit.ly/4ePAOFK / daniellamyoung_ \nUnamerican video book (on Patreon): https://bit.ly/YTVideoBook\nSecret Practice video book (on Patreon): https://bit.ly/3ZswGY8\n\nOther Podcasts\nDaniella\u0027s other podcast: Hey White Women\nTakeaways\nTaylor Marie is a mental health therapist specializing in narcissistic abuse and cult recovery.\nOnline cults operate similarly to in-person cults, with differences mainly in communication.\nRecruitment often occurs through social media platforms like TikTok, using charisma and confidence.\nThe sense of belonging is a powerful tool used by cults to maintain control over members.\nCharismatic leaders often exploit followers\u0027 desires for purpose and belonging.\nRed flags include isolation from outside information and constant negative comparisons to others in the field.\nHealthy leadership promotes free thinking and allows for questioning and disagreement.\nCults often take credit for the successes of their members, creating a cycle of dependency.\nLeaving a cult can feel like a crisis, as one\u0027s worldview is challenged and dismantled.\nIt is possible to lead in spiritual practices without coercion or manipulation. The breaking point often comes when personal values clash with group beliefs.\nQuestioning authority can lead to significant personal revelations.\nLeaving a cult can involve emotional and legal repercussions.\nSocial media can amplify voices and expose harmful practices.\nThe aftermath of leaving a cult can affect family relationships.\nCult leaders often manipulate their followers through fear and guilt.\nIt\u0027s important to recognize the signs of cult-like behavior in groups.\nPersonal growth often follows the questioning of long-held beliefs.\nThe experience of leaving a cult can be isolating and traumatic.\nSupport from family and friends is crucial during the exit process.\nChapters\n00:00 Introduction to Cults and Online Communities\n 01:32 Defining Online Cults\n 05:11 The Evolution of Relationships in the Digital Age\n 07:19 Recruitment Tactics in Online Cults\n 10:18 The Dynamics of Charismatic Leadership\n 12:21 The Exploitation of Belonging and Purpose\n 14:24 Red Flags and Realizations\n 21:55 Healthy Leadership vs. Cult Leadership\n 28:21 The Crisis of Leaving a Cult\n 28:46 The Breaking Point: Values and Morals in Conflict\n 31:24 Questioning Authority: The Cult Leader\u0027s Influence\n 34:04 The Cost of Leaving: Emotional and Legal Retaliation\n 43:53 Going Viral: The Power of Social Media in Exposing Cults\n 50:17 The Aftermath: Family Dynamics and Public Scrutiny\nProduced by Haley Phillips",

Tia shares her insights on the dynamics of complementarianism, the consequences of perfectionism, and the importance of storytelling in healing. The conversation emphasizes the need for awareness and empowerment among those affected by high-control groups, while also exploring the complexities of societal change and the role of women in shaping the future.\n\nTia\u0027s Links\n\nhttps://tialevings.com/\n\nhttps://tialevings.substack.com/\n\nInstagram @tialevingswriter\n\nThreads @tialevingswriter\n\nTikTok @tialevingswriter\n\nDaniella\u0027s Links:\n\nYou can read all about my story in my book, Uncultured-- buy signed copies here. https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\nFor more info on me:\nPatreon: https://bit.ly/YTPLanding\nCult book Clubs (Advanced AND Memoirs) Annual Membership: https://bit.ly/YTPLanding\nGet an autographed copy of my book, Uncultured: https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\nGet my book, Uncultured, from Bookshop.org: https://bit.ly/4g1Ufw8\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/3V6GK6k / KnittingCultLady\nInstagram:  https://bit.ly/4ePAOFK / daniellamyoung_ \nUnamerican video book (on Patreon): https://bit.ly/YTVideoBook\nSecret Practice video book (on Patreon): https://bit.ly/3ZswGY8\nOther Podcasts\n\nDaniella\u0027s other podcast: Hey White Women\n\nTakeaways\n\nTia\u0027s book started as therapeutic journals recommended by her therapist.\nThe journey to writing a memoir can take years and evolve over time.\nChristian patriarchy influences many aspects of American culture.\nThe concept of a \u0027cult without walls\u0027 highlights the pervasive nature of these deologies.\nTraditionalism can appear attractive but often masks deeper issues.\nPerfectionism is a significant burden for survivors of cults.\nThe most vulnerable individuals often bear the brunt of abuse in high-control groups.\nHope and empowerment are crucial in the face of societal chaos.\nPeople should always come before ideas in any belief system.\nBitterness can serve as a powerful tool for healing and empowerment. \nSound Bites\n\n\u0022Welcome to 2025: A New Beginning\u0022\n\u0022It took years to tell my story\u0022\n\u0022Hope is stubborn and necessary\u0022\n\nChapters\n\n00:00 Introduction and Context of 2025\n03:39 The Journey to Writing a Memoir\n06:25 The Impact of Christian Patriarchy\n09:30 The Connection Between Personal Experience and Cultural Issues\n12:25 The Allure of Traditional Gender Roles\n15:27 Nostalgia and Misconceptions of the Past\n18:15 Facing the Truth of Domestic Discipline\n21:30 The Importance of Sharing Stories\n24:14 The Dynamics of Complementarianism\n27:14 Recognizing Abuse and Empowering Individuals\n31:20 Breaking Free from Perfectionism\n33:39 Childhood Vulnerability in Cults\n35:53 The Future of Cults and Youth Movements\n37:18 Chaos and Fundamentalism\n38:02 Narcissism and Cult Leadership\n39:29 Women\u2019s Empowerment and Resistance\n40:27 Surviving Authoritarianism\n41:53 The Power of Storytelling\n43:16 Bitterness as Empowerment\n52:59 People Over Ideas: A Fundamental Principle\n\nProduced by Haley Phillips",

      "description": "In this conversation, Daniella and Jack explore the parallels between cult dynamics and the education system, particularly focusing on how teaching can exhibit cult-like characteristics. They discuss the impact of masculinity, patriarchy, and the control of children within educational settings. The conversation delves into the degradation ceremonies present in both cults and schools, the role of punishment in hierarchical systems, and the importance of unstructured outdoor time for child development. They also address the exploitation of teachers\u0027 labor, the purpose of education in society, and the need for resistance against oppressive structures. Ultimately, they emphasize the importance of community action and hope for a better future.\n\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@knittingcultlady?lang=enYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nUnamerican Videobook: https://tr.ee/ODM-qtUJaR\nSecret Practice Videobook: https://tr.ee/DGEY3IeQQm\n\nConnect with Scot Loyd\u0027s social media :https://www.tiktok.com/@thescotloyd",

The hosts and guest discuss the coercive tactics used in recovery programs, the sacred status of AA, and the lack of alternative options presented to individuals seeking help. They explore the psychological impacts of language used in these groups, the importance of personal agency, and the potential for abuse within leadership structures.

      "description": "The conversation explores the topic of underwear and its role in control and oppression. It delves into the societal expectations and policing of women\u0027s bodies, the arbitrary nature of professionalism, and the intersection of underwear with race and gender. The discussion also touches on the history of underwear, the influence of capitalism and consumerism, and the connection between underwear and abuse in cults. Overall, the conversation highlights the ways in which underwear is used as a tool for control and the need to challenge societal norms and expectations. The conversation explores various topics related to identity, race, and gender. It touches on issues such as colorism, body image, breastfeeding in public, and the challenges faced by women in the military. The speakers discuss the infantilization and sexualization of women, the pressure to conform to societal expectations, and the importance of understanding and acknowledging one\u0027s own privilege. They also highlight the need for white women to listen and learn from marginalized communities, rather than trying to prove their goodness or uniqueness. In this final part of the conversation, Rebecca and Daniella discuss the insidious nature of white supremacy and the need for white people to trust Black people\u0027s awareness of racism. They also explore the importance of questioning societal norms and expectations, such as appearance control and underwear requirements. They emphasize the need for white people to deconstruct white supremacy and opt out of the game, leading to true freedom, joy, and friendship.\n\nTakeaways\n\nUnderwear is often used as a tool for control and oppression, with societal expectations and policing of women\u0027s bodies.\nThe concept of professionalism is arbitrary and can be used to marginalize and exclude certain individuals.\nThe history of underwear reveals the influence of capitalism and consumerism, as well as the infantilization of sexuality in society.\nUnderwear can be connected to abuse in cults, where it is used as a means of control and surveillance.\nChallenging societal norms and expectations around underwear is important for promoting body autonomy and dismantling oppressive systems. Colorism and body image issues are prevalent in society, leading to the infantilization and sexualization of women.\nBreastfeeding in public is still stigmatized, despite laws protecting a woman\u0027s right to do so.\nWomen in the military face challenges related to uniform fit, gender expectations, and stereotypes.\nWhite women should listen and learn from marginalized communities, rather than trying to prove their goodness or uniqueness. White people need to trust Black people\u0027s awareness of racism and understand that they know more about racism than white people do.\nQuestioning societal norms and expectations, such as appearance control and underwear requirements, is essential in deconstructing white supremacy.\nWhite people should opt out of the game of white supremacy and embrace true freedom, joy, and community.\nDeconstructing white supremacy takes time and ongoing work, and it is a continuous process of learning and unlearning.\nThe goal is not to be obsessed as white people, but to challenge and dismantle white supremacy for a more equitable society.\n\nProduced By: Haley Phillips\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@KnittingCultLady\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nRebecca\u2019s Links: \nWebsite: https://www.whitewomanwhisperer.com/Cults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://tr.ee/IZBXVo667J\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/whitewomanwhisperer\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@white_woman_whisperer?_t=8nslhOSSy8g\u0026_r=1\nUnamerican Videobook: https://tr.ee/ODM-qtUJaR\nSecret Practice Videobook: https://tr.ee/DGEY3IeQQm",

      "description": "In this episode of \u0022Cults and the Culting of America,\u0022 hosts Scot Loyd and Daniella Mestyanek Young delve into the concept of charismatic leadership within cults. They begin by discussing how the idea of a charismatic leader is often associated with cults, highlighting that many of these leaders are typically perceived as white males. Daniella explains that while cults have been largely defined by white western academics, the underlying structure of patriarchy predates even white supremacy and capitalism, making it a fundamental aspect of coercive control in cults.\n\nThe conversation touches on notable examples of charismatic leaders, including Keith Raniere, David Berg, and Jim Jones, as well as Elizabeth Holmes and Adam Neumann. Daniella emphasizes that charismatic authority is not just about charm but involves qualities that make people grant these leaders extraordinary influence. She discusses how these leaders often transition from being charismatic figures to being deified by their followers, creating a system where their personal mythology becomes integral to the group\u0027s identity.\n\nScot and Daniella explore the psychological and social mechanisms that make individuals susceptible to charismatic leaders. They discuss the concept of \u0022front-of-the-room advantage,\u0022 where the mere act of being in a position of authority can make a person seem more credible and likable. They also highlight the role of rhetoric and persuasive communication in enhancing a leader\u0027s influence, noting how leaders use techniques like \u0022trance talk\u0022 to captivate and manipulate their audience.\n\nThe episode concludes with a discussion on the importance of critical thinking and diverse social connections in protecting oneself from falling prey to cult-like influence. Daniella shares her \u0022guru gotcha\u0022 checklist, a tool she developed to help identify potential red flags in leaders and groups. Both hosts stress the need for self-awareness and skepticism, encouraging listeners to examine the charismatic leaders in their lives critically. They also preview upcoming episodes, including an exploration of the role of the \u0022skinny white woman\u0022 in cult dynamics and the broader impact of group psychology on individual behavior.",

      "description": "In this conversation, Daniella Mestyanek Young and Rebecca discuss their experiences with cults and the deconstruction of white supremacy. They explore the stages of leaving a cult and the process of deprogramming from the myth of white supremacy. They also touch on topics such as privilege, racism, and the impact of cult dynamics on society. The conversation highlights the need for self-reflection, questioning societal norms, and working towards equality. In this conversation, Daniella and Rebecca discuss the importance of self-reflection and deconstructing the systems of white supremacy and patriarchy. They emphasize the need for white women to recognize their privilege and actively work to dismantle oppressive systems. They also discuss the power of vulnerability and the role of social media in spreading awareness and creating change. The conversation touches on topics such as the cult-like nature of societal systems, the challenges of living authentically within capitalism, and the role of art and creativity in personal growth.\n \nConnect with Rebecca at: \n\nWebsite: \n\nhttps://www.whitewomanwhisperer.com\n\nPatreon: \n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/whitewomanwhisperer\n\nTikTok: @white_woman_whisperer\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@white_woman_whisperer?_t=8nslhOSSy8g\u0026_r=1\n\n \n\n \n\nConnect with Daniella at:\n\nDaniella\u0027s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\n\nTikTok: @daniellamestyanekyoung\n\nInstagram: @_daniellamyoung\n\nhttps://www.uncultureyourself.com/\n\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\n\nUnAMERICAN Videobook\n\n \n\nGet the book: UNCULTURED: A Memoir    \n\n\u0022A propulsive memoir delivered in the honest tones of a woman who didn\u0027t always think she\u0027d live to tell her story.\u0022 --NYT  \n\n \n\nSee a Sample Chapter in Rolling Stone Magazine \n\nSee a Sample Chapter in The Sydney Herald\n\n \n\nWords in: Newsweek \u0026 Narratively\n\n \n\nGet a copy of UNCULTURED: Digital, Audio, or Hardcopy or preorder the paperback as a holiday gift for a friend.\n\nGet an Autographed copy here: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\n \nTakeaways\nThere are three stages of leaving a cult: waking up, cracking the brainwashing, and physically and mentally leaving the cult.\nDeconstructing from the myth of white supremacy requires a process of deprogramming that can take years.\nWhite supremacy is like a cult, and deconstructing it involves questioning societal norms and recognizing the impact of privilege and racism.\nCult dynamics, such as the need to defend the good intentions of the group, can be observed in white supremacy and other systems of oppression.\nRecognizing and challenging the sacred assumptions of white supremacy is essential for dismantling the system and creating equality. Recognize and reflect on your own privilege and the systems of white supremacy and patriarchy that perpetuate inequality.\nChallenge and dismantle oppressive systems by actively working to create change.\nEmbrace vulnerability and use your voice to spread awareness and inspire others to take action.\nQuestion and deconstruct your own beliefs and behaviors to ensure they align with your values and promote equality.\nFind ways to live authentically and resist the pressures of capitalism and societal expectations.\nUse art and creativity as a means of personal growth and self-expression.\nSound Bites\n\u0022White supremacy is like a booger\u0022\n\u0022White supremacy starts radicalizing you the second you set foot here\u0022\n\u0022Deconstructing white supremacy is a process of self-reflection and questioning\u0022\n\u0022Hey, black women, if you\u0027re alone in a conference room and someone\u0027s about to walk in and it\u0027s gonna be a white person, would you rather be a white man or a white woman?\u0022\n\u0022White women are the men of women.\u0022\n\u0022Once you can name it, you can fix it.\u0022\nChapters\n00:00Introduction and Background\n02:32Growing Up in Diverse Communities and Discovering Cult Dynamics\n05:22Creating Safe Spaces for Black People to Share with White People\n07:49Leaving Seattle and Deconstructing White Supremacy\n10:11White Supremacy as a Booger and Challenging Sacred Assumptions\n13:07The Radicalization of White Supremacy and Deconstructing Beauty Standards\n20:49The Interconnectedness of Patriarchy and White Supremacy\n25:01The Need to Stack Rank and the Impact of White Supremacy\n28:18Questioning the Cult of Capitalism and Valuing Humanization\n31:04The Con of White Supremacy and the Benefits of Equality\n37:02The Power of Vulnerability and Spreading Awareness\n48:56Living Authentically and Resisting Capitalism\n53:28Art and Creativity as Tools for Personal Growth",

(Charismatic Leadership)\n\nThis chapter begins with the story of how two kids from communes built an organization that seemed to hypnotize people out of their money. Despite all the red flags, investors flocked to the charismatic leader, and the young and hip followed him, with his pretty wife by his side, as WeWork plummeted from startup darling to embarrassment.\n\nIn this chapter, we\u2019ll take a look at the science of charisma and the process of deification that give us leaders like both Churchill and Hitler. We\u2019ll take a detour into presentation, style, and the development of what some are calling \u201Cguru voice,\u201D and see how people like Adam Newman of WeWork worked all of these quite successfully into his business persona. We\u2019ll learn how these leaders who love to think of themselves as unique actually set predictable enough patterns that they appear \u201Cto have all attended the same Messiah school,\u201D according to renowned cult expert Dr. Janja Lalich. We\u2019ll take a look at the rise of the thought leader and influencer, ever more popular with the debut of each new social media platform, and we\u2019ll explore how businesses and religions have become cults in the past.\n\nSign up here for my women\u2019s/non-binary veteran support group book club: https://tr.ee/7kETMnSylC\n\n- [ ] Get an autographed copy of my critically acclaimed memoir, Uncultured, here: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\n\nHere is where you can purchase UnAmerican , my video book, and sequel to uncultured: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal/shop/unamerican-video-book-memoir-217440?utm_medium=clipboard_copy\u0026utm_source=copyLink\u0026utm_campaign=productshare_creator\u0026utm_content=join_link\n\n- [ ] Here\u2019s my knitting cult lady store (just flip to store tab) https://linktr.ee/Daniellamyoung?utm_source=linktree_profile_share\u0026ltsid=7a4a3793-44e8-433a-8c72-e39ed754562c\n\nI\u2019m Daniella, scholar of cults, extreme groups, and extremely bad leadership.

I have a masters degree from the Harvard extension school in organizational psychology, and I\u2019m writing my next book, the Culting of America.\n\nIt is also an audio, the editor of the New York Times arts and culture section, said it was one of his favorite things of 2023: https://www.audible.com/pd/B09Q7JWDRS?source_code=ASSORAP0511160006\u0026share_location=pdp\n\nIf you like one of the T-shirts you see me wearing, get your own disrespectful T-shirt here: https://www.uncultureyourself.com/disrespectful-tshirts\n\nIf you like the custom crocheted jewelry (dissent collar, exit cuffs, love bomb earrings) my Etsy shop is here: https://www.etsy.com/shop/combatbarbie101/?etsrc=sdt\n\n#groupbehaviorgal #groupbehaviorscholar #cultscholar #\n#uncultured #organizationalpsychology #harvard #culttalk #cultsurvivor   #deconstruction #deconstructingchristianity #deconstructingcults #womenveterans #usarmy #departmentofdefense #rapeculture #totalinstitutions #knitting #crochet #cultgirl #armygirl #harvardgirl #groupbehavior #powerandcontrol #programming and influence #groupsandsystems #systemsofpower #groupdevelopment #extremism  #terrorism #childrenofgod #cultbaby #cultingofamerica #cultinessspectrum #alittlebitculty #therearenogurus #therearenosuperheroes #deconstruction #exchristiantiktok #organizationalvalues #freedomofmind #exmo #ldscult #ldshighcontrol #magicunderwear #exvangelical #exchristian #religion #exreligion #highcontrolgroup #cultleadership #leadership #goodleadership #organizationalleadership #grouplanguage #groupthink #insiderlanguage #outsiderlanguage #coercivecontrol #indoctrination #booksworthreading #readingforpleasure #knittingcultlady #devotionswithdaniella",

The charismatic leader (\u0026 their skinny white woman) \n2. Worldview shift that brings you under the sacred assumption\n3. The transcendent mission \n4. Self-sacrifice of members\n5. Limits access to outside world\n6. Distinguishable vernacular\n7. Us versus them mentality\n8. Exploits members labor\n9. High entrance \u0026 exit costs \n10.
