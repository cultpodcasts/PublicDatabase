Rudnev, 57, had previously been sentenced to 11 years in a Siberian prison for rape and running a sex cult. He now faces fresh charges, including human trafficking, sexual exploitation, and drug offenses. Rudnev founded the Ashram Shambala cult in 1989, manipulating mostly female followers into surrendering their assets and engaging in coerced sexual rituals. The arrest was triggered by the discovery of a frightened and malnourished young pregnant Russian woman, sparking suspicions of abuse and underage involvement. \n\nBethany Joy Lenz\u0027s Memoir Resonates with Abuse Survivors \nActress Bethany Joy Lenz, known for her role on \u201COne Tree Hill,\u201D has been receiving daily messages from women in abusive relationships following the release of her memoir, \u201CDinner with Vampires.\u201D In the book, Lenz details her decade-long experience in a controlling religious cult while working on the hit TV series. Her candid revelations about emotional abuse and manipulation have resonated deeply with readers, empowering many to confront their own situations. \nSome of the Zizians have had court appearances related to their alleged crimes\nSFGate has a headline reading Zizians Bay Area court appearance descends into chaos which seems on brand for a group that tried to kill someone with a samurai sword.\nOne of the members of the cult who is transgender has been vocal about these trials being an effort to force her to detransition, which is interesting because she\u2019s right about the pervasiveness of antitrans thinking, but the crimes were real. Could be that Ziz took advantage of her reasonable fears and manipulated them. \nDallas observer has an article about Homestead Heretige, another case of a possible cult (but definitely fringe religious group) in plane sight. \nIt has a \u201Ccheese cave\u201D (a cheese aging facility) which is advertised with billboards along the highway.

They explore personal experiences with cults, the intersection of race and cults, and the societal responses to these groups. The discussion highlights the role of white women in these conversations, the importance of listening and learning from diverse experiences, and the manipulative tactics employed by cults. The speakers emphasize that conflict can be a necessary part of understanding and navigating these topics, and they advocate for a more nuanced approach to discussing race and identity within the context of cults. In this conversation, Daniella and Rebecca explore the complexities of racial discussions, the importance of asking questions, and the role of community in understanding different perspectives. They delve into the nuances of consumer privilege in content creation, the challenges of neurodiversity, and the impact of cultural practices on comfort and community. The discussion also touches on the significance of authenticity, self-reflection, and the dynamics of rebranding in personal and societal contexts.\nIn this episode of Cults and the Culting of America, hosts Scot Loyd and Daniella Mestyneck Young explore the current political climate in the U.S. and its parallels to cult dynamics. They discuss the rise of cult mentality, the deification of leaders, and the implications of executive power. The conversation emphasizes the importance of community, collective action, and the role of art in resisting oppressive governance.

The discussion touches on themes of identity, race, and the struggles of belonging within high-control groups. They explore the dynamics of critical thinking versus apologetics in Christian education, the impact of the model minority myth, and the role of empathy in Christianity. Scott reflects on his experiences teaching at a Christian university and the challenges he faced while trying to foster a more inclusive environment. The conversation culminates in a discussion about the current state of Christianity and its intersection with social justice, as well as Scott\u0027s ongoing work in helping others navigate their own journeys out of high-control groups.\n\nScott Okamoto\u0027s Links:\nSubstack: https://substack.com/@rscottokamoto\nPodcast: https://dauntless.fm/podcast/chapelprobation\nBook: https://www.amazon.com/Asian-American-Apostate-Evangelical-University/dp/1957687134/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3QP6SE2AAI1T1\u0026dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.0p-xvXdpJMmt_FA1Q-HkqRgPCiXPDvPM3EppX46bKPjZUG4WpTESenEla-l9DYyxPCkDQnVJJ9qrLZSh4WZ_1uIDAGYESVjxRR79uaOQHpd06LPxG_h4e_0I3_m3H9l4L_lb_6sOrETyVNX4bpTSvQ.JIctlVaeieZomPYqV3T5eFblD6jkharPVN3lCXVwExo\u0026dib_tag=se\u0026keywords=asian\u002Bamerican\u002Bapostate\u0026qid=1736191778\u0026sprefix=asian\u002Bamerican\u002Bapostate%2Caps%2C226\u0026sr=8-1\n\nDaniella\u0027s Links:\nYou can read all about my story in my book, Uncultured-- buy signed copies here. https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\nFor more info on me:\nPatreon: https://bit.ly/YTPLanding\nCult book Clubs (Advanced AND Memoirs) Annual Membership: https://bit.ly/YTPLanding\nGet an autographed copy of my book, Uncultured: https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\nGet my book, Uncultured, from Bookshop.org: https://bit.ly/4g1Ufw8\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/3V6GK6k / KnittingCultLady\nInstagram:  https://bit.ly/4ePAOFK / daniellamyoung_ \nUnamerican video book (on Patreon): https://bit.ly/YTVideoBook\nSecret Practice video book (on Patreon): https://bit.ly/3ZswGY8\n\nOther Podcasts\nDaniella\u0027s other podcast: Hey White Women--https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp/\n\nTakeaways\nScott Okamoto shares his experience growing up in evangelical Christianity.\nThe conversation highlights the struggles of identity and belonging in high-control groups.\nCritical thinking is often stifled in Christian education, replaced by apologetics.\nThe model minority myth complicates the experiences of Asian Americans in evangelical spaces.\nEmpathy is lacking in contemporary Christianity, as evidenced by recent teachings.\nScott\u0027s journey out of evangelicalism was gradual, marked by many small realizations.\nInterpersonal relationships can be a significant barrier to leaving high-control groups.\nScott\u0027s current work focuses on helping others navigate their experiences in Christian schools.\nThe conversation draws parallels between cult dynamics and the tech industry.\nThe hosts emphasize the importance of questioning and critical engagement in all areas of life.\nChapters\n00:00 Introduction and Acknowledgment of Social Issues\n 01:55 Scott Okamoto\u0027s Journey in Evangelical Christianity\n 06:53 Struggles with Identity and Belonging\n 10:40 The Role of Argumentation in Cults and Christianity\n 15:13 Toxic Masculinity and Church Dynamics\n 18:24 Racial Dynamics in Christianity\n 23:44 The Model Minority Myth and Its Implications\n 30:03 Recognizing Our Place in the Movement\n 31:08 The Journey of Awakening\n 32:13 The Struggle with Faith and Reality\n 35:01 The Cop-Out of Prayer\n 36:28 The Politics of Panic\n 38:57 Interpersonal Relationships and Leaving the Church\n 40:05 Finding Community Beyond the Church\n 43:30 Empathy and the State of Christianity\n 44:44 The Podcast and the Book\n 52:41 The Cult of the Tech Industry\nProduced by Haley Phillips",

It is being propagated by a cult expert who is wrong about this. \n\nTo clarify: being transgender is an identity, NOT a cult. There can and are trans people in cults (like there can be cis people in cults), and in this case we have a trans cult leader. But trans identity is not a cult. \n\nAbout Me: \nI\u0027m Daniella Mestyanek Young, scholar of cults, extreme groups, and extremely bad leadership.

Taylor shares her experiences with an online cult, discussing the similarities between online and in-person cults, the recruitment tactics used, and the psychological manipulation involved. The conversation explores the dynamics of charismatic leadership, the exploitation of belonging and purpose, and the red flags that led to Taylor\u0027s eventual departure from the cult. The discussion also touches on the importance of healthy leadership and the potential for spiritual practices to exist without devolving into cult-like behavior. In this conversation, Taylor Marie shares her harrowing experience of being involved in a cult-like astrology group, detailing the emotional turmoil and moral conflicts she faced. She discusses the manipulative tactics of the cult leader, the fear of leaving, and the subsequent backlash she received after her departure. The conversation highlights the importance of questioning authority and the role of social media in exposing harmful groups. Taylor\u0027s journey of self-discovery and the impact on her family dynamics are also explored, culminating in a powerful narrative of resilience and personal growth.\n\nDaniella\u0027s Links:\nYou can read all about my story in my book, Uncultured-- buy signed copies here. https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\nFor more info on me:\nPatreon: https://bit.ly/YTPLanding\nGet an autographed copy of my book, Uncultured: https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\nGet my book, Uncultured, from Bookshop.org: https://bit.ly/4g1Ufw8\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/3V6GK6k / KnittingCultLady\nInstagram:  https://bit.ly/4ePAOFK / daniellamyoung_ \nUnamerican video book (on Patreon): https://bit.ly/YTVideoBook\nSecret Practice video book (on Patreon): https://bit.ly/3ZswGY8\n\nOther Podcasts\nDaniella\u0027s other podcast: Hey White Women\nTakeaways\nTaylor Marie is a mental health therapist specializing in narcissistic abuse and cult recovery.\nOnline cults operate similarly to in-person cults, with differences mainly in communication.\nRecruitment often occurs through social media platforms like TikTok, using charisma and confidence.\nThe sense of belonging is a powerful tool used by cults to maintain control over members.\nCharismatic leaders often exploit followers\u0027 desires for purpose and belonging.\nRed flags include isolation from outside information and constant negative comparisons to others in the field.\nHealthy leadership promotes free thinking and allows for questioning and disagreement.\nCults often take credit for the successes of their members, creating a cycle of dependency.\nLeaving a cult can feel like a crisis, as one\u0027s worldview is challenged and dismantled.\nIt is possible to lead in spiritual practices without coercion or manipulation. The breaking point often comes when personal values clash with group beliefs.\nQuestioning authority can lead to significant personal revelations.\nLeaving a cult can involve emotional and legal repercussions.\nSocial media can amplify voices and expose harmful practices.\nThe aftermath of leaving a cult can affect family relationships.\nCult leaders often manipulate their followers through fear and guilt.\nIt\u0027s important to recognize the signs of cult-like behavior in groups.\nPersonal growth often follows the questioning of long-held beliefs.\nThe experience of leaving a cult can be isolating and traumatic.\nSupport from family and friends is crucial during the exit process.\nChapters\n00:00 Introduction to Cults and Online Communities\n 01:32 Defining Online Cults\n 05:11 The Evolution of Relationships in the Digital Age\n 07:19 Recruitment Tactics in Online Cults\n 10:18 The Dynamics of Charismatic Leadership\n 12:21 The Exploitation of Belonging and Purpose\n 14:24 Red Flags and Realizations\n 21:55 Healthy Leadership vs. Cult Leadership\n 28:21 The Crisis of Leaving a Cult\n 28:46 The Breaking Point: Values and Morals in Conflict\n 31:24 Questioning Authority: The Cult Leader\u0027s Influence\n 34:04 The Cost of Leaving: Emotional and Legal Retaliation\n 43:53 Going Viral: The Power of Social Media in Exposing Cults\n 50:17 The Aftermath: Family Dynamics and Public Scrutiny\nProduced by Haley Phillips",

      "description": "In this conversation, Daniella and Jack explore the parallels between cult dynamics and the education system, particularly focusing on how teaching can exhibit cult-like characteristics. They discuss the impact of masculinity, patriarchy, and the control of children within educational settings. The conversation delves into the degradation ceremonies present in both cults and schools, the role of punishment in hierarchical systems, and the importance of unstructured outdoor time for child development. They also address the exploitation of teachers\u0027 labor, the purpose of education in society, and the need for resistance against oppressive structures. Ultimately, they emphasize the importance of community action and hope for a better future.\n\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@knittingcultlady?lang=enYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nUnamerican Videobook: https://tr.ee/ODM-qtUJaR\nSecret Practice Videobook: https://tr.ee/DGEY3IeQQm\n\nConnect with Scot Loyd\u0027s social media :https://www.tiktok.com/@thescotloyd",

The hosts and guest discuss the coercive tactics used in recovery programs, the sacred status of AA, and the lack of alternative options presented to individuals seeking help. They explore the psychological impacts of language used in these groups, the importance of personal agency, and the potential for abuse within leadership structures.

      "description": "The conversation explores the topic of underwear and its role in control and oppression. It delves into the societal expectations and policing of women\u0027s bodies, the arbitrary nature of professionalism, and the intersection of underwear with race and gender. The discussion also touches on the history of underwear, the influence of capitalism and consumerism, and the connection between underwear and abuse in cults. Overall, the conversation highlights the ways in which underwear is used as a tool for control and the need to challenge societal norms and expectations. The conversation explores various topics related to identity, race, and gender. It touches on issues such as colorism, body image, breastfeeding in public, and the challenges faced by women in the military. The speakers discuss the infantilization and sexualization of women, the pressure to conform to societal expectations, and the importance of understanding and acknowledging one\u0027s own privilege. They also highlight the need for white women to listen and learn from marginalized communities, rather than trying to prove their goodness or uniqueness. In this final part of the conversation, Rebecca and Daniella discuss the insidious nature of white supremacy and the need for white people to trust Black people\u0027s awareness of racism. They also explore the importance of questioning societal norms and expectations, such as appearance control and underwear requirements. They emphasize the need for white people to deconstruct white supremacy and opt out of the game, leading to true freedom, joy, and friendship.\n\nTakeaways\n\nUnderwear is often used as a tool for control and oppression, with societal expectations and policing of women\u0027s bodies.\nThe concept of professionalism is arbitrary and can be used to marginalize and exclude certain individuals.\nThe history of underwear reveals the influence of capitalism and consumerism, as well as the infantilization of sexuality in society.\nUnderwear can be connected to abuse in cults, where it is used as a means of control and surveillance.\nChallenging societal norms and expectations around underwear is important for promoting body autonomy and dismantling oppressive systems. Colorism and body image issues are prevalent in society, leading to the infantilization and sexualization of women.\nBreastfeeding in public is still stigmatized, despite laws protecting a woman\u0027s right to do so.\nWomen in the military face challenges related to uniform fit, gender expectations, and stereotypes.\nWhite women should listen and learn from marginalized communities, rather than trying to prove their goodness or uniqueness. White people need to trust Black people\u0027s awareness of racism and understand that they know more about racism than white people do.\nQuestioning societal norms and expectations, such as appearance control and underwear requirements, is essential in deconstructing white supremacy.\nWhite people should opt out of the game of white supremacy and embrace true freedom, joy, and community.\nDeconstructing white supremacy takes time and ongoing work, and it is a continuous process of learning and unlearning.\nThe goal is not to be obsessed as white people, but to challenge and dismantle white supremacy for a more equitable society.\n\nProduced By: Haley Phillips\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@KnittingCultLady\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nRebecca\u2019s Links: \nWebsite: https://www.whitewomanwhisperer.com/Cults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://tr.ee/IZBXVo667J\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/whitewomanwhisperer\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@white_woman_whisperer?_t=8nslhOSSy8g\u0026_r=1\nUnamerican Videobook: https://tr.ee/ODM-qtUJaR\nSecret Practice Videobook: https://tr.ee/DGEY3IeQQm",

      "description": "In this episode of \u0022Cults and the Culting of America,\u0022 hosts Scot Loyd and Daniella Mestyanek Young delve into the concept of charismatic leadership within cults. They begin by discussing how the idea of a charismatic leader is often associated with cults, highlighting that many of these leaders are typically perceived as white males. Daniella explains that while cults have been largely defined by white western academics, the underlying structure of patriarchy predates even white supremacy and capitalism, making it a fundamental aspect of coercive control in cults.\n\nThe conversation touches on notable examples of charismatic leaders, including Keith Raniere, David Berg, and Jim Jones, as well as Elizabeth Holmes and Adam Neumann. Daniella emphasizes that charismatic authority is not just about charm but involves qualities that make people grant these leaders extraordinary influence. She discusses how these leaders often transition from being charismatic figures to being deified by their followers, creating a system where their personal mythology becomes integral to the group\u0027s identity.\n\nScot and Daniella explore the psychological and social mechanisms that make individuals susceptible to charismatic leaders. They discuss the concept of \u0022front-of-the-room advantage,\u0022 where the mere act of being in a position of authority can make a person seem more credible and likable. They also highlight the role of rhetoric and persuasive communication in enhancing a leader\u0027s influence, noting how leaders use techniques like \u0022trance talk\u0022 to captivate and manipulate their audience.\n\nThe episode concludes with a discussion on the importance of critical thinking and diverse social connections in protecting oneself from falling prey to cult-like influence. Daniella shares her \u0022guru gotcha\u0022 checklist, a tool she developed to help identify potential red flags in leaders and groups. Both hosts stress the need for self-awareness and skepticism, encouraging listeners to examine the charismatic leaders in their lives critically. They also preview upcoming episodes, including an exploration of the role of the \u0022skinny white woman\u0022 in cult dynamics and the broader impact of group psychology on individual behavior.",

      "description": "In this conversation, Daniella Mestyanek Young and Rebecca discuss their experiences with cults and the deconstruction of white supremacy. They explore the stages of leaving a cult and the process of deprogramming from the myth of white supremacy. They also touch on topics such as privilege, racism, and the impact of cult dynamics on society. The conversation highlights the need for self-reflection, questioning societal norms, and working towards equality. In this conversation, Daniella and Rebecca discuss the importance of self-reflection and deconstructing the systems of white supremacy and patriarchy. They emphasize the need for white women to recognize their privilege and actively work to dismantle oppressive systems. They also discuss the power of vulnerability and the role of social media in spreading awareness and creating change. The conversation touches on topics such as the cult-like nature of societal systems, the challenges of living authentically within capitalism, and the role of art and creativity in personal growth.\n \nConnect with Rebecca at: \n\nWebsite: \n\nhttps://www.whitewomanwhisperer.com\n\nPatreon: \n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/whitewomanwhisperer\n\nTikTok: @white_woman_whisperer\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@white_woman_whisperer?_t=8nslhOSSy8g\u0026_r=1\n\n \n\n \n\nConnect with Daniella at:\n\nDaniella\u0027s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\n\nTikTok: @daniellamestyanekyoung\n\nInstagram: @_daniellamyoung\n\nhttps://www.uncultureyourself.com/\n\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\n\nUnAMERICAN Videobook\n\n \n\nGet the book: UNCULTURED: A Memoir    \n\n\u0022A propulsive memoir delivered in the honest tones of a woman who didn\u0027t always think she\u0027d live to tell her story.\u0022 --NYT  \n\n \n\nSee a Sample Chapter in Rolling Stone Magazine \n\nSee a Sample Chapter in The Sydney Herald\n\n \n\nWords in: Newsweek \u0026 Narratively\n\n \n\nGet a copy of UNCULTURED: Digital, Audio, or Hardcopy or preorder the paperback as a holiday gift for a friend.\n\nGet an Autographed copy here: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\n \nTakeaways\nThere are three stages of leaving a cult: waking up, cracking the brainwashing, and physically and mentally leaving the cult.\nDeconstructing from the myth of white supremacy requires a process of deprogramming that can take years.\nWhite supremacy is like a cult, and deconstructing it involves questioning societal norms and recognizing the impact of privilege and racism.\nCult dynamics, such as the need to defend the good intentions of the group, can be observed in white supremacy and other systems of oppression.\nRecognizing and challenging the sacred assumptions of white supremacy is essential for dismantling the system and creating equality. Recognize and reflect on your own privilege and the systems of white supremacy and patriarchy that perpetuate inequality.\nChallenge and dismantle oppressive systems by actively working to create change.\nEmbrace vulnerability and use your voice to spread awareness and inspire others to take action.\nQuestion and deconstruct your own beliefs and behaviors to ensure they align with your values and promote equality.\nFind ways to live authentically and resist the pressures of capitalism and societal expectations.\nUse art and creativity as a means of personal growth and self-expression.\nSound Bites\n\u0022White supremacy is like a booger\u0022\n\u0022White supremacy starts radicalizing you the second you set foot here\u0022\n\u0022Deconstructing white supremacy is a process of self-reflection and questioning\u0022\n\u0022Hey, black women, if you\u0027re alone in a conference room and someone\u0027s about to walk in and it\u0027s gonna be a white person, would you rather be a white man or a white woman?\u0022\n\u0022White women are the men of women.\u0022\n\u0022Once you can name it, you can fix it.\u0022\nChapters\n00:00Introduction and Background\n02:32Growing Up in Diverse Communities and Discovering Cult Dynamics\n05:22Creating Safe Spaces for Black People to Share with White People\n07:49Leaving Seattle and Deconstructing White Supremacy\n10:11White Supremacy as a Booger and Challenging Sacred Assumptions\n13:07The Radicalization of White Supremacy and Deconstructing Beauty Standards\n20:49The Interconnectedness of Patriarchy and White Supremacy\n25:01The Need to Stack Rank and the Impact of White Supremacy\n28:18Questioning the Cult of Capitalism and Valuing Humanization\n31:04The Con of White Supremacy and the Benefits of Equality\n37:02The Power of Vulnerability and Spreading Awareness\n48:56Living Authentically and Resisting Capitalism\n53:28Art and Creativity as Tools for Personal Growth",

(Charismatic Leadership)\n\nThis chapter begins with the story of how two kids from communes built an organization that seemed to hypnotize people out of their money. Despite all the red flags, investors flocked to the charismatic leader, and the young and hip followed him, with his pretty wife by his side, as WeWork plummeted from startup darling to embarrassment.\n\nIn this chapter, we\u2019ll take a look at the science of charisma and the process of deification that give us leaders like both Churchill and Hitler. We\u2019ll take a detour into presentation, style, and the development of what some are calling \u201Cguru voice,\u201D and see how people like Adam Newman of WeWork worked all of these quite successfully into his business persona. We\u2019ll learn how these leaders who love to think of themselves as unique actually set predictable enough patterns that they appear \u201Cto have all attended the same Messiah school,\u201D according to renowned cult expert Dr. Janja Lalich. We\u2019ll take a look at the rise of the thought leader and influencer, ever more popular with the debut of each new social media platform, and we\u2019ll explore how businesses and religions have become cults in the past.\n\nSign up here for my women\u2019s/non-binary veteran support group book club: https://tr.ee/7kETMnSylC\n\n- [ ] Get an autographed copy of my critically acclaimed memoir, Uncultured, here: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\n\nHere is where you can purchase UnAmerican , my video book, and sequel to uncultured: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal/shop/unamerican-video-book-memoir-217440?utm_medium=clipboard_copy\u0026utm_source=copyLink\u0026utm_campaign=productshare_creator\u0026utm_content=join_link\n\n- [ ] Here\u2019s my knitting cult lady store (just flip to store tab) https://linktr.ee/Daniellamyoung?utm_source=linktree_profile_share\u0026ltsid=7a4a3793-44e8-433a-8c72-e39ed754562c\n\nI\u2019m Daniella, scholar of cults, extreme groups, and extremely bad leadership.

I have a masters degree from the Harvard extension school in organizational psychology, and I\u2019m writing my next book, the Culting of America.\n\nIt is also an audio, the editor of the New York Times arts and culture section, said it was one of his favorite things of 2023: https://www.audible.com/pd/B09Q7JWDRS?source_code=ASSORAP0511160006\u0026share_location=pdp\n\nIf you like one of the T-shirts you see me wearing, get your own disrespectful T-shirt here: https://www.uncultureyourself.com/disrespectful-tshirts\n\nIf you like the custom crocheted jewelry (dissent collar, exit cuffs, love bomb earrings) my Etsy shop is here: https://www.etsy.com/shop/combatbarbie101/?etsrc=sdt\n\n#groupbehaviorgal #groupbehaviorscholar #cultscholar #\n#uncultured #organizationalpsychology #harvard #culttalk #cultsurvivor   #deconstruction #deconstructingchristianity #deconstructingcults #womenveterans #usarmy #departmentofdefense #rapeculture #totalinstitutions #knitting #crochet #cultgirl #armygirl #harvardgirl #groupbehavior #powerandcontrol #programming and influence #groupsandsystems #systemsofpower #groupdevelopment #extremism  #terrorism #childrenofgod #cultbaby #cultingofamerica #cultinessspectrum #alittlebitculty #therearenogurus #therearenosuperheroes #deconstruction #exchristiantiktok #organizationalvalues #freedomofmind #exmo #ldscult #ldshighcontrol #magicunderwear #exvangelical #exchristian #religion #exreligion #highcontrolgroup #cultleadership #leadership #goodleadership #organizationalleadership #grouplanguage #groupthink #insiderlanguage #outsiderlanguage #coercivecontrol #indoctrination #booksworthreading #readingforpleasure #knittingcultlady #devotionswithdaniella",

The charismatic leader (\u0026 their skinny white woman) \n2. Worldview shift that brings you under the sacred assumption\n3. The transcendent mission \n4. Self-sacrifice of members\n5. Limits access to outside world\n6. Distinguishable vernacular\n7. Us versus them mentality\n8. Exploits members labor\n9. High entrance \u0026 exit costs \n10.
