      "description": "In this episode, Daniella Mestyanek Young (Knitting Cult Lady) and Rebecca (White Woman Whisperer) unpack the process of recording the audiobook version of Daniella\u2019s upcoming book and explore how their collaboration reflects deeper dynamics of race, privilege, and creative responsibility. They discuss rejecting the \u201Ceasy\u201D or most cost-effective route in favor of ethical decisions that honor Black voices and resist capitalist shortcuts. The conversation then broadens into weaponizing whiteness for good\u2014how white women can leverage social privilege to confront injustice\u2014and the nuances of accountability, cultural power, and self-deconstruction. From Taylor Swift and fandom culture to the politics of \u201CKaren energy\u201D and organizing white women, they tackle how white femininity functions within systems of white supremacy and how to redirect it toward meaningful change.\n\n Connect with Rebecca at:\u00A0\u00A0\n\nhttps://www.whitewomanwhisperer.com/\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/whitewomanwhisperer\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@white_woman_whisperer\n\nPreorder for Culting of America: https://knittingcultlady.com/products/the-culting-of-america\nGo Fund Me for Publishing Culting of America: https://tr.ee/FTOBLyQnYo\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/4muxbu6 / @knittingcultladychat\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nCults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://sites.libsyn.com/534892/site\nWhite Women Get Ready: https://www.mistresssyndrome.com/book\n\n\n Key Takeaways:\n\n The fear of standing out in white culture traces back to witch trials and remains embedded in social norms.\n\n White supremacy and patriarchy teach emotional repression as moral strength.\n\n The military and corporate systems reinforce conformity and replaceability over individuality.\n\n \u201CNon-practicing white\u201D fails as a concept because whiteness itself is an imposed norm that denies difference.\n\n Beauty standards valorize proximity to whiteness while extracting ethnic features.\n\n Cultural evangelism\u2014needing others to adopt your way of life\u2014comes from fear of isolation within whiteness.\n\n Self-care and emotional expression are forms of resistance against white patriarchal conditioning.\n\n Dance and communal expression highlight how joy is systemically stripped from white cultural spaces.\n\n True cultural integration requires curiosity and humility, not performance or token participation.\n\n Reclaiming identity means finding safety in individuality rather than sameness.\n\nChapters\n\n00:00 The Audiobook Journey\n02:53 Navigating Identity and Voice\n05:36 Community and Collaboration\n08:38 The Power of Whiteness\n11:19 Understanding Miscommunication\n13:58 Weaponizing Whiteness\n16:51 The Role of White Women in Activism\n19:38 The Influence of Culture and Media\n26:53 The Promise and the Disappointment\n28:09 Taylor Swift\u0027s Influence and Responsibility\n30:18 Cult of Personality: Taylor Swift as a Leader\n34:30 Deconstructing the Swiftie Identity\n37:41 Navigating Fandoms and Personal Identity\n43:57 Music as a Reflection of Self\n49:01 The Complexity of Critique and Nostalgia\n54:21 Cultural Misunderstandings and Identity\n56:26 The Impact of Whiteness on Discourse\n58:35 Exploring Vulnerability and Cultural Exchange\n01:01:42 The Role of Women in Social Change\n01:06:05 Taylor Swift: A Case Study in Feminism\n01:08:38 The Limitations of Individualism in Leadership\n01:13:53 The Importance of Accountability in Communities\n\nProduced by Haley Phillips",

These days, I\u0027m also known as the Knitting Cult Lady. I grew up in the Children of God cult (also known as the Family International), and served 2 tours of duty in the cult of the US army.  I noticed that those two organizations had a lot in common and have been studying them and what we can learn about other cults-- and how to protect ourselves from coercive control and abusive situations. My second book, The Culting of America, delves even deeper into the ways that cultic systems and coercive control show up in every day life.

Their conversation explores how America\u2019s educational and social systems function as cult-like institutions that condition compliance, suppress individuality, and reflect deeper cultural hierarchies. Together, they draw parallels between trauma survival, masking behaviors, racial inequity, and the ways storytelling can challenge systemic norms. They also discuss how white privilege manifests in subtle daily ways, the importance of listening across difference, and the transformative power of reading beyond one\u2019s own identity.\n\n Daniella\u0027s Links:\n\n  Preorder for Culting of America:  https://knittingcultlady.com/products/the-culting-of-america\n\nGo Fund Me for Culting of America: https://tr.ee/fldwYRFTJI\n\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\n\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\n\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\n\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@knittingcultlady?lang=en\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\n\nUnamerican Videobook: https://tr.ee/ODM-qtUJaR\n\nSecret Practice Videobook: https://tr.ee/DGEY3IeQQm\n\n\n Scot\u0027s Socials\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@thescotloyd\n\n@thescotloyd \n\nHaley\u0027s Tiktok\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@nuancedmasculinities\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n    Jamal Bruce, a Black high school teacher in Chicago, found Uncultured profoundly validating and inspiring, prompting his shift toward social work.\n\n    Daniella and Jamal discuss how schools often mirror cult-like systems that demand conformity and suppress individuality.\n\n    Both highlight how trauma survivors often overachieve as a coping mechanism\u2014seeking safety in perfection and compliance.\n\n    Educators of color are more likely to \u201Csee\u201D marginalized students and advocate for them because of shared systemic experiences.\n\n    The U.S. educational model has roots in Puritan indoctrination and continues to prioritize obedience over humanity.\n\n    White privilege shows up in small, everyday ways\u2014like who gets questioned, believed, or celebrated for multilingualism.\n\n    The conversation emphasizes the need to believe marginalized voices rather than debate their experiences.\n\n    Daniella reflects on how publishing, like education, gatekeeps whose stories are told and deemed \u201Cmarketable.\u201D\n\n    Both guests stress reading broadly and engaging with diverse perspectives as a way to dismantle bias and foster empathy.\n\n    Uncultured demonstrates how personal trauma can illuminate collective social conditioning, inviting broader discussions of power, race, and belonging.\n\nChapters\n\n00:00 Introduction to Uncultured Perspectives\n02:41 The Role of Educators in Social Change\n05:26 Personal Stories of Advocacy and Support\n08:19 The Cult-like Nature of Education\n11:20 Navigating Identity and Trauma in Education\n14:10 The Intersection of Race and Education\n16:44 The Impact of Trauma on Academic Performance\n19:35 The Complexity of Privilege and Identity\n22:33 The Need for Authenticity in Education\n25:27 Conclusion: Shared Experiences and Collective Growth\n29:03 Finding Your Audience in Storytelling\n30:25 Relating Through Shared Emotions\n32:33 Understanding Different Perspectives\n34:53 The Importance of Believing Experiences\n37:32 Recognizing Privilege in Society\n40:32 Bilingualism and Perceptions of Intelligence\n44:06 Challenging Gender and Racial Stereotypes\n48:18 The Journey of Deconstructing Worldviews\n51:06 The Power of Diverse Narratives\n\nProduced by Haley Phillips, Lizy Freudmann, and Meghan Picmann",

      "description": "In this episode, Daniella (\u201CKnitting Cult Lady\u201D) and Rebecca (\u201CWhite Woman Whisperer\u201D) have a deep, layered conversation about deconstructing whiteness, celebrity culture, and over-identification through the lens of Taylor Swift. Daniella shares her personal process of deconstructing her identity as a lifelong Swiftie and connecting it to her broader work dismantling white womanhood and American cultic structures. Rebecca brings in a critical Black feminist lens, exploring the difference between individualism and community, white women\u2019s relationship to innocence and denial, and how fandom functions as a mirror for identity and privilege.\n\nThe two also connect this conversation to broader cultural patterns\u2014from Gilmore Girls to Game of Thrones\u2014and discuss how media teaches white women to see themselves as exceptional, misunderstood, and self-made. They unpack \u201Cterminal uniqueness,\u201D \u201Cfake niceness,\u201D and the coercive politeness embedded in white culture. Daniella and Rebecca close by reflecting on faith, atheism, and hierarchy within whiteness\u2014especially how Christian supremacy informs cultural norms in America.\n\n Connect with Rebecca at:\n\n The White Woman Whisperer Website\n\n \n\n The White Woman Whisperer Patreon\n\n \n\n The White Woman Whisperer TikTok\n\n \n\n Connect with Daniella at:\n\n Preorder for Culting of America: The Culting of America PRE-SALE (SHIPS BY JANUARY 20, 2026) \u2013 Knitting Cult Lady\nGo Fund Me for Publishing Culting of America: https://tr.ee/FTOBLyQnYo\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/4muxbu6 / @knittingcultladychat\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nCults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://sites.libsyn.com/534892/site\n\n    \uD83D\uDCA1 Key Takeaways\n\n        Deconstructing fandom is deconstructing identity. Daniella\u2019s \u201Cbreakup\u201D with Taylor Swift represents more than music taste\u2014it\u2019s a symbolic dismantling of the white feminine ideal she once internalized.\n\n        White womanhood as cultic identity. Whiteness offers a readymade script for identity and safety, one that requires complicity and denial of harm to others.\n\n        Rebecca\u2019s insight: Black women often see the patterns first because racism makes those structures visible sooner; white women must choose to see them.\n\n        Over-identification as trauma behavior. Daniella connects her past idolization to childhood deprivation of identity and expression, explaining how celebrity worship fills that void.\n\n        The myth of \u201Cself-made.\u201D Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201Cself-made billionaire\u201D narrative mirrors American capitalist mythology and ignores systemic privilege.\n\n        \u201CSaving face is killing your body.\u201D Rebecca\u2019s phrase captures how protecting image and comfort perpetuates harm in whiteness.\n\n        The cult of America. Daniella names fame, capitalism, and Christian supremacy as overlapping cults driving American ideology.\n\n        Polite coercion. They close by dissecting \u201Cfake niceness,\u201D the performance of friendliness and small talk as tools of social control within white culture.\n\n    Chapters\n\n    00:00 Introduction to the Conversation\n    03:25 Deconstructing Celebrity Culture and Identity\n    07:13 Understanding Whiteness and Privilege\n    10:40 The Impact of Taylor Swift on Black Women\n    14:12 The Role of Media in Shaping Identity\n    18:33 Betrayal and Trust in Celebrity Fandom\n    25:13 Concluding Thoughts on Deconstruction and Identity\n    27:05 Identity and Celebrity: The Swiftie Experience\n    29:56 Language and Identity: The Power of Vernacular\n    32:21 Cultural Reflections: Music, Media, and Self-Discovery\n    38:34 Community Dynamics: Protecting the Queen vs. Individuality\n    44:02 The Cult of Fame: Hollywood\u0027s Influence on Identity\n    50:09 Critique vs. Attack: Navigating Conversations about Celebrity\n    56:51 Navigating Social Norms and Expectations\n    59:10 Cultural Differences in Social Interactions\n    01:01:43 Neurodivergence and Communication Challenges\n    01:03:55 The Complexity of Listening and Learning\n    01:06:41 Romanticizing Endings and Life Changes\n    01:09:21 Deconstructing Whiteness and Identity\n    01:12:26 The Burden of Expectations in Art and Business\n    01:15:13 The Journey of Self-Discovery and Growth\n\n    Produced by Haley Phillips",

      "description": "In this episode of Cults and the Culting of America, hosts Scot Loyd and Daniella Mestyanek Young unpack Secretary of War Pete Hegseth\u2019s recent dystopian-sounding address to military leadership, examining it through the lens of cult psychology, gendered standards, and authoritarian control.\n\nDaniella dissects how \u201Cstandards\u201D and \u201Cprofessionalism\u201D in the military are tools to maintain patriarchal and racial hierarchies, using examples like grooming policies and \u201Cgender-neutral\u201D male standards. She argues that rhetoric like Hegseth\u2019s is part of a broader movement toward Christian nationalism and toxic militarized masculinity, dubbing it the \u201CMojo Dojo Casa Military.\u201D\n\nTogether, they explore whether the U.S. military could ever be used against American citizens, why cult-like obedience structures are dangerous, and how individual ethics, diversity, and generational change make full-scale authoritarian control unlikely.\n\nThe conversation then shifts toward Scot\u2019s new book, The God That I Was Given: Looking for Faith After Losing My Religion. Daniella and Scot discuss faith deconstruction, privilege, and how to hold space for both pride in one\u2019s past and critical honesty about harm. They reflect on storytelling, accountability, and how both military and religious institutions reward conformity and punish introspection.\n\n Daniella\u0027s Links:\n\nPreorder for Culting of America: The Culting of America PRE-SALE (SHIPS BY JANUARY 20, 2026) \u2013 Knitting Cult Lady\nGo Fund Me for Publishing Culting of America: https://tr.ee/FTOBLyQnYo\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/4muxbu6 / @knittingcultladychat\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nCults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://sites.libsyn.com/534892/site\n\n Scot\u0027s Socials\n\nTikTok:   @thescotloyd\n\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/@thescotloyd\n\nHaley\u0027s Tiktok\n\n@nuancedmasculinities\n\uD83D\uDD11 Key Takeaways\n\n    \u201CStandards\u201D are culturally constructed \u2014 often used to uphold existing power structures under the guise of objectivity.\n\n    \u201CGender neutral\u201D usually means \u201Cmale\u201D \u2014 erasing femininity and reinforcing patriarchal norms.\n\n    Hegseth\u2019s rhetoric reflects toxic masculinity, racial dog whistles, and authoritarian nostalgia for a \u201CDepartment of War.\u201D\n\n    Military culture mirrors cult structures, but its guiding \u201Ccult\u201D is loyalty to the Constitution \u2014 not to any single leader.\n\n    Younger service members (Millennials \u0026 Gen Z) are reshaping the culture toward diversity, empathy, and critical thinking.\n\n    Brainwashing tactics from abusive systems and cults were deliberately baked into modern military training.\n\n    Deconstruction is not destruction \u2014 you can be proud of aspects of your experience while acknowledging systemic harm.\n\n    Both hosts connect cult dynamics across institutions \u2014 religion, the military, and politics all rely on controlling narratives.\n\n    Writing memoirs like Uncultured and The God That I Was Given provides a model for honest reflection that includes both pride and pain.\n\n    Truth-telling invites criticism, but it\u2019s vital for cultural healing and understanding.\n\nChapters\n\n00:00 Introduction to the Podcast and Guests\n00:53 Military Standards and Gender Equality\n03:43 Rhetoric and Leadership in the Military\n06:29 Concerns Over Military Use Against Citizens\n09:21 Basic Training and Military Culture\n12:08 The Role of Experience in Military Leadership\n14:54 Political Rhetoric and Military Professionalism\n17:51 Diversity in the Military and Its Implications\n20:39 Public Perception and Military Loyalty\n23:23 Historical Context of Military Orders\n26:09 Conclusion and Future Implications\n28:18 Generational Perspectives in the Military\n32:50 The Culting of America: A Deeper Dive\n37:16 Navigating Privilege and Perspective\n41:48 The Complexity of Faith and Deconstruction\n47:06 The Power of Storytelling and Truth\n54:22 Closing Thoughts on Diversity and Listening\n\nProduced by Haley Phillips, Meghan Picmann, and Lizy Freudmann",

Rebecca revisits her viral \u201Ccaption gate\u201D controversy, unpacking how white women often use moralized accessibility language (\u201Cjust add captions\u201D) as a covert way to assert dominance and demand labor. The two also dissect the cultural discomfort around Black women expressing anger, the dehumanizing expectations placed on female creators, and the myth that public educators or creators owe perpetual pleasantness to their audiences.\nThey expand the conversation to systemic scales: the white supremacist work ethic that glorifies suffering, the military\u2019s regressive standards, and the false nostalgia driving political backslides. The pair closes with reflections on intergenerational whiteness, transracial adoption, and the ongoing need for white women to reckon with their racialization\u2014rather than seeing themselves as raceless allies.\nIt\u2019s a dense, sharp, and often darkly funny exchange about boundaries, race, labor, and community care online.\n\nConnect with Rebecca at:\nhttps://www.whitewomanwhisperer.com \nhttps://www.patreon.com/whitewomanwhisperer\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@white_woman_whisperer?_t=8nslhOSSy8g\u0026_r=1\n \nConnect with Daniella at:\nPreorder for Culting of America: The Culting of America PRE-SALE (SHIPS BY JANUARY 20, 2026) \u2013 Knitting Cult Lady\nGo Fund Me for Publishing Culting of America: https://tr.ee/FTOBLyQnYo\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/4muxbu6 / @knittingcultladychat\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nCults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://sites.libsyn.com/534892/site\n\nKey Takeaways\nConsumer privilege often disguises itself as politeness (\u201Cjust asking nicely\u201D) but still demands access and compliance.\n\nAccessibility discourse can be co-opted to center white comfort rather than actual inclusion.\n\nTone policing is a key mechanism of white supremacy\u2014framing emotional expression by women, especially Black women, as unprofessional or undeserving.\n\nFree content \u2260 public ownership.

The conversation highlights how overwork, guilt, and moral injury can act as control mechanisms in \u201Chelping professions\u201D like veterinary care\u2014mirroring high-demand group tactics.\nDr. Jo discusses the emotional toll of her work, including the constant oscillation between joy (new puppies) and grief (euthanasia), the high suicide rate among veterinarians, and the systemic lack of self-care built into the profession. Daniella connects these patterns to her broader analysis of institutional cultures that exploit compassion, while Scot reflects on similar burnout dynamics from his time as a pastor.\nThe trio also dives into capitalism\u2019s role in normalizing self-sacrifice, the ethics of euthanasia, empathy toward animals and humans, and the need for structural\u2014not just individual\u2014change to protect caregivers from exploitation.

      "description": "In this episode of Cults and the Culting of America, hosts Daniella Mestyanek Young and Scot Loyd welcome musician and activist Candi Carpenter. The conversation dives into parallels between growing up in evangelical Christianity and high-control cult environments, with both Daniela and Candi sharing deeply personal stories.\n\nCandi discusses their upbringing as a pastor\u2019s kid in a gospel family band, the ways purity culture and religious control shaped their identity, and their long deconstruction journey. They reflect on how music, satire, and community have helped them reclaim their voice and selfhood after years of suppression.\n\nThe discussion touches on the loneliness of cult childhoods, the psychological effects of being taught constant fear of sin and hell, and how neurodivergence (autism, OCD) made them especially vulnerable to indoctrination. Humor and satire emerge as powerful tools of resistance\u2014whether in music videos mocking political figures or in Daniella\u2019s plans for a \u201Ccult baby musical.\u201D\n\nThe episode closes with reflections on healing, therapy, medication, and the importance of building authentic community beyond transactional, conversion-driven relationships.\n\nCandi\u0027s Links: \nhttps://open.spotify.com/artist/1puU6o4S6FqGkdcPoImWVr\nhttps://music.apple.com/us/artist/candi-carpenter/43501706\nhttps://www.youtube.com/candicarpenter\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@candi_carpenter\nhttps://www.instagram.com/candicarpenter/\n\nDaniella\u0027s Links:\nGo Fund Me for Publishing Culting of America: https://tr.ee/FTOBLyQnYo\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/4muxbu6 / @knittingcultladychat\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nCults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://sites.libsyn.com/534892/site\nWhite Women Get Ready: https://www.mistresssyndrome.com/book\n\nScot\u0027s Socials\nTikTok:  @thescotloyd\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/@thescotloyd\n\nHaley\u0027s Tiktok\n@nuancedmasculinities\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nParallel Journeys: Both Daniela and Candi grew up under strict religious control, with performance and purity culture shaping much of their childhood.\n\nMusic as Survival: Candi uses songwriting to process trauma, reclaim identity, and connect with others who share similar experiences.\n\nDeconstruction \u0026 Identity: Their exit from evangelicalism was gradual, involving moments of perspective shift (like viewing church rituals through outsiders\u2019 eyes) and self-discovery (embracing their non-binary identity).\n\nNeurodivergence \u0026 Cults: Autism and OCD traits made Candi especially susceptible to religious rules, scrupulosity, and fear-based control.\n\nPurity Culture \u0026 Harm: Conversations highlighted how purity teachings overlap with exploitation, creating damaging relationships with sex, self, and others.\n\nSatire as Activism: Through bold political satire (like their \u201CAmerican God\u201D video), Candi critiques extremism and authoritarianism with humor.\n\nCommunity After Cults: Online spaces like Candi\u2019s Discord \u201CCandyland\u201D provide connection and solidarity for those who once felt isolated.\n\nHealing Tools: Therapy, finding the right medication, and embracing joy (from late-night milkshakes to creative play) are key in recovery.\n\nUnmasking \u0026 Authenticity: A central theme is moving from masking and people-pleasing (ingrained by cult culture) toward living authentically without fear of rejection.\n\nShared Mission: Both Daniela and Candi see their art\u2014books, music, satire, musicals\u2014as ways to expose control systems, build resilience, and help others heal.\n\nChapters\n00:00 Introduction to Candi Carpenter and Cult Themes\n02:51 Exploring the Impact of Cults on Identity\n05:31 Deconstructing Religious Upbringing and Its Effects\n08:38 The Role of Music in Healing and Community\n11:19 Navigating Personal Trauma and Artistic Expression\n14:07 The Intersection of Humor and Activism\n17:23 Political Satire and the Role of Artists\n20:03 Embracing Individuality and Non-Binary Identity\n22:54 The Future of Music and Activism\n25:44 Conclusion and Reflections on Fear and Anger\n30:42 The Journey of Healing and Self-Discovery\n34:23 Navigating Relationships Beyond Cults\n37:16 The Struggle with People-Pleasing\n40:21 Embracing Authenticity and Self-Acceptance\n44:45 The Role of Therapy and Medication in Healing\n49:37 Creating Art as a Means of Expression\n\nProduced by Haley Phillips",

Daniella shares insights from her forthcoming book The Culting of America, reflecting on the accessibility of ideas across mediums (books, documentaries, TikTok), and the challenges of being taken seriously while calling the military a cult. The discussion ranges from personal deconstruction journeys, the paradox of proving oneself, and the caste-like structures of whiteness, to critiques of purity culture, efficiency-driven institutions, and performative empathy. The episode closes with a reminder to focus on joy, embodiment, and building community beyond oppressive systems\n\nConnect with Rebecca at:\nhttps://www.whitewomanwhisperer.com/\nhttps://www.patreon.com/c/whitewomanwhisperer/home\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@white_woman_whisperer?_t=8nslhOSSy8g\u0026_r=1\n \nConnect with Daniella at:\nGo Fund Me for Publishing Culting of America: https://tr.ee/FTOBLyQnYo\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/4muxbu6 / @knittingcultladychat\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nCults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://sites.libsyn.com/534892/site\nWhite Women Get Ready: https://www.mistresssyndrome.com/book\n\nKey Takeaways \n\u25CF The U.S. military operates with cult-like dynamics, even if the industry resists that framing.\n\n\u25CF Proving yourself to institutions or skeptics is draining and cedes power \u2014 the paradox of proving.\n\n\u25CF Storytelling across mediums (books, documentaries, TikTok) makes ideas more accessible.\n\n\u25CF Whiteness often relies on denial and purity culture, dismissing lived realities.\n\n\u25CF Shared learning (like audiobooks) can support personal and relational growth during deconstruction.\n\n\u25CF Reading should be about joy and curiosity, not purity tests of \u201Cseriousness.\u201D\n\n\u25CF Systems built on efficiency reduce people to products or instruments of productivity.\n\n\u25CF Centering joy, embodiment, and community resists oppressive systems.\n\nChapters\n00:00 The Value of Ownership in Creative Work\n05:51 The Impact of Race on Opportunities\n11:46 Mind Control and Societal Expectations\n17:29 The Importance of Shared Ideas in Relationships\n26:06 The Impact of Trauma on Reading\n29:29 Navigating Feelings in Literature\n33:57 The Pressure of Academic Success\n35:48 The Value of Exploration in Learning\n37:47 The Complexity of Life Decisions\n40:03 The Freedom of Childhood\n41:24 The Burden of Decision-Making\n43:33 The Dynamics of Agreement and Disagreement\n45:10 The Role of Expertise in Conversations\n47:42 Understanding Hierarchies in Knowledge\n50:33 The Intersection of Identity and Expertise\n50:50 The Humiliation Ritual of White Women\n53:16 Cultural Differences in Body Image\n54:47 The Denial of Reality in Whiteness\n57:04 Experiencing Pain and Denial\n59:24 Believing Black Experiences\n01:01:53 The Control of Narrative\n01:03:20 The Illusion of Protection\n01:05:36 The Burden of Women\u2019s Safety\n01:07:34 The Real Dangers of Racism and Violence\n01:09:50 Acknowledging Internalized Bias\n01:11:19 The Value of Diverse Skills\n01:13:12 The Hierarchy of Worth in Society\n01:15:02 The Importance of Community\n01:17:56 The Debate Over Symbols and Identity\nProduced By Haley Phillips",

Ruwan recounts his two years in the organization, explaining how he was drawn in by its promises of intimacy and meaning, but soon became entangled in manipulation, labor exploitation, and coercive sales tactics.\n\nThe discussion highlights parallels between OneTaste and other coercive groups, including the use of s#! as recruitment, redefining language to control members\u2019 worldview, punishing dissent, and demanding lifelong commitment. Ruwan also reflects on the psychological toll of leaving, the social shunning he endured, and how indoctrination made it difficult to criticize the leader. The episode closes with reflections on cult dynamics, the dangers of committing one\u2019s life to a group or ideology, and Ruwan\u2019s upcoming memoir that ties his personal journey to OneTaste\u2019s recent criminal convictions.\n\nDaniella\u0027s Links:\nGo Fund Me for Publishing Culting of America: https://tr.ee/FTOBLyQnYo\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/4muxbu6 / @knittingcultladychat\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nCults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://sites.libsyn.com/534892/site\nWhite Women Get Ready: https://www.mistresssyndrome.com/book\n\nScot\u0027s Socials\nTikTok:  @thescotloyd\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/@thescotloyd\n\nRuwan\u2019s Pre-order Book\nhttps://orgsmbook.com/\n\nHaley\u0027s Tiktok\n@nuancedmasculinities\n\nKey Takeaways\nSex as a recruitment tool: OneTaste initially used sexuality to attract members but retained them through promises of connection, meaning, and personal growth.\n\nLabor exploitation: Members often worked for extremely low wages (e.g., $2/hour) under the belief that they were serving a higher cause.\n\nManipulation through language: Words like orgasm were redefined to mean progressively broader and more spiritual concepts, fostering a worldview unique to the group.\n\nHigh performer recruitment: Contrary to stereotypes, cults often seek intelligent, articulate, and passionate individuals who can recruit others effectively.\n\nIsolation tactics: Practices like banning \u201Ccollusion\u201D (sharing doubts) kept members from validating each other\u2019s concerns. Dissenters were shunned or vilified.\n\nCommitment pressure: Members were pushed to \u201Ccommit their lives\u201D by giving up finances, autonomy, or public loyalty, often under threat of rejection.\n\nGood cop/bad cop dynamics: Leaders or lieutenants alternated between affection and criticism to manipulate compliance.\n\nFalse empowerment: Despite its branding as a female empowerment movement, OneTaste remained patriarchal and exploitative, especially of young women.\n\nLeader protection: The founder avoided blame by delegating harsh decisions, maintaining a \u201Chalo effect\u201D that made criticism difficult.\n\nLeaving costs: Exiting meant social exile, loss of community, and pressure to humiliate oneself in order to be accepted back.\n\nParallels to other systems: Comparisons were drawn to military indoctrination, religious cults, NXIVM, and Scientology, showing shared patterns of control.\n\nHuman vulnerability: Cults thrive by appealing to universal desires\u2014belonging, meaning, and devotion to a higher purpose\u2014while exploiting them for control.\n\nChapters\n00:00 Isolation and Emotional Turmoil in Cults\n33:10 The Legal Consequences of Cult Activities\n36:09 The Dynamics of Power and Gender in Cults\n39:01 Reflections on Cult Experiences and Future Directions\n\nProduced By Haley Phillips",

      "description": "This episode brings Daniella Mestyanek Young and Rebecca into a candid conversation about cult dynamics, purity culture, whiteness, and the process of building communities rooted in truth rather than secrecy or shame. They unpack how cult logic\u2014like the weaponization of secrets, unquestioned authority, and worship of the written word\u2014maps onto broader systems like white supremacy and American culture. Daniella reflects on her work writing Uncultured and her upcoming projects, highlighting how her extreme experiences serve as an entry point for others to recognize parallels in their own lives. Rebecca emphasizes \u201Cun-gaslighting\u201D as a practice\u2014naming harmful cultural dynamics so people can break free from them. Together, they discuss credibility, community care, and how both survivors of cults and white women confronting systemic racism can take responsibility for their healing without centering competition or trauma-shaming. The conversation balances personal storytelling with calls to collective responsibility and imagination for healthier communities.\n\nConnect with Rebecca at:\nhttps://www.whitewomanwhisperer.com\n https://www.patreon.com/whitewomanwhisperer\n https://www.tiktok.com/@white_woman_whisperer?_t=8nslhOSSy8g\u0026_r=1\n \nConnect with Daniella at:\nGo Fund Me for Publishing Culting of America: https://tr.ee/FTOBLyQnYo\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/4muxbu6 / @knittingcultladychat\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nCults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://sites.libsyn.com/534892/site\nWhite Women Get Ready: https://www.mistresssyndrome.com/book\n\nKey Takeaways\n\u25CF Secrets as a red flag: Both cults and oppressive systems often rely on secrecy and silencing. Naming and sharing truth is a liberating act.\n\u25CF Worship of the written word: Blind adherence to texts (like the Bible or Constitution) enables harm; authority must be questioned, not just accepted because it\u2019s written.\n\u25CF Community building: Daniella and Rebecca frame their work as \u201Cun-gaslighting,\u201D affirming survivors\u2019 stories without gatekeeping what counts as \u201Creal\u201D trauma.\n\u25CF Relatability as entry point: Daniella\u2019s extreme cult background creates credibility, but the deeper goal is helping everyday people recognize how white supremacy and patriarchy function in subtler ways.\n\u25CF Responsibility in whiteness: White women in particular must deconstruct their complicity in white supremacy and should see themselves as \u201Cgraduate students\u201D learning, not professors teaching.\n\u25CF Trauma without competition: Healthy communities don\u2019t shame members for their trauma or create hierarchies of suffering.\n\u25CF Credibility and confidence: Both speakers reflect on moving past needing external validation (degrees, books, male approval) and instead trusting their lived expertise.\n\u25CF Sustainable activism: Both stress pacing, safety, and intentionality\u2014choosing to build platforms that reach the right people rather than chasing universal approval.\n\nChapters\n00:00 Defending Perspectives and Building Platforms\n02:54 The Value of Self-Identification and Expertise\n05:59 The Role of Written Word and Capitalism\n08:55 Secrets, Trauma, and Community\n11:53 Cult Survivorship and Storytelling\n14:32 Building a Supportive Community\n17:41 Worship of the Written Word and Its Implications\n20:41 Navigating Trauma and Identity\n25:50 Navigating Perceptions and Identity\n26:56 The Power of Saying No\n29:21 Purity Culture and Its Implications\n31:13 The Role of Authority in Religion\n33:54 Establishing Credibility and Expertise\n37:28 Audience Engagement and Reactions\n39:59 Understanding Authoritarianism and Voting Behavior\n42:52 The Role of Influencers in Social Change\n53:47 Collaboration and Visibility in Activism\n54:34 Bridging the Gap in Conversations\n57:57 The Role of White Creators in Deconstructing Whiteness\n01:00:55 Understanding Achievement Addiction and Its Implications\n01:03:45 Redefining Cults and Coercive Control\n01:07:41 Using Privilege for Positive Change\n01:09:34 The Power of Collective Action\n01:12:37 Navigating Conversations on Race and Privilege\nProduced by Haley Phillips",

Sydney recounts her family\u2019s involvement with the commune Christ Circle in the 1970s\u201380s, her experience being homeschooled in a high-control, secrecy-driven environment, and the lingering effects of trauma passed down through generations.\n\nShe reflects on estranging from her mother, the challenges of being the \u201Ccycle breaker\u201D in her family, and how medical neglect, secrecy, and MAGA ideology compounded dysfunction. Sydney shares her diagnosis with POTS, her healing journey, and how reading Daniella\u2019s book gave her the language to process her past. The conversation highlights themes of secrecy, performance versus authenticity, generational trauma, and the courage it takes to leave and heal.\n\nThe episode closes with Sydney reading a moving reflection addressed to \u201Ccycle breakers,\u201D emphasizing the exhausting but vital work of stopping harmful patterns and choosing a different path for future generations.\n\nSydney\u0027s Podcast: \nSpotify\n\nDaniella\u0027s Links:\nGo Fund Me for Publishing Culting of America: https://tr.ee/FTOBLyQnYo\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/4muxbu6 / @knittingcultladychat\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nCults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://sites.libsyn.com/534892/site\nWhite Women Get Ready: https://www.mistresssyndrome.com/book\n\nScot\u0027s Socials\nTikTok:  @thescotloyd\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/@thescotloyd\nHaley\u0027s Tiktok\n@nuancedmasculinities\n\nKey Takeaways\nSecrecy as a control tactic: Families and cults often weaponize secrecy to hide abuse and dysfunction.\n\nGenerational trauma: Even those who didn\u2019t grow up directly in the cult carry the impact of their family\u2019s involvement.\n\nCycle breaking: Refusing to pass trauma down to children requires conscious effort, vulnerability, and immense energy.\n\nMedical neglect in cults: Distrust of healthcare often leads to undiagnosed or untreated conditions, deepening harm.\n\nAuthenticity vs. performance: Survivors reclaim agency by refusing to be \u201Cshiny showpieces\u201D and instead choosing authentic lives.\n\nEmpowerment through language: Finding words to describe trauma and control systems is a crucial step in healing.\n\nHealing through community: Safe environments, supportive partners, and shared survivor stories provide tools for recovery.\n\nChapters\n00:00 Introduction to Culting and Personal Stories\n01:56 Sydney\u0027s Journey: Growing Up in a High Control Environment\n04:25 The Impact of Secrecy in Cults\n10:21 Family Dynamics and Dysfunction\n12:16 Breaking the Cycle of Trauma\n18:34 Responsibility of the Cycle Breaker\n20:41 Navigating Medical Denials and Personal Growth\n23:18 Breaking Free from Toxic Relationships\n25:56 The Impact of Cults on Parenting and Family Dynamics\n30:13 Authenticity vs. Performance in Cult Environments\n33:29 Finding Safety and Healing in New Relationships\n35:51 The Journey of a Cycle Breaker\nProduced by Haley Phillips",

      "description": "In this episode, Daniella \u0026 Rebecca dive into themes of creativity, body image, cultural conditioning, \u0026 the lingering impacts of cult and purity culture. Daniella shares her journey of transforming clothing \u0026 crafts as a form of healing, while Rebecca draws connections between whiteness, consumerism, and self-imposed restrictions on bodies and identities. Together, they unpack how purity culture manifests in practices like \u201Cpurity balls,\u201D clothing expectations, \u0026 even shower habits, connecting these to deeper systems of control rooted in patriarchy, whiteness, \u0026 colonization.\nThe conversation also explores cross-cultural experiences of communal bathing, body acceptance, \u0026 how exposure to diverse bodies \u0026 practices can shift self-perception. They highlight how ignorance\u2014whether about washing, menstruation, or cultural traditions\u2014becomes institutionalized \u0026 weaponized, often to exclude or control marginalized groups.\nThe episode closes by reflecting on language, labeling, \u0026 how subtle choices in words carry histories of colonization, while also pointing toward possibilities for decolonizing everyday life through awareness, community, \u0026 art.\n\nConnect with Rebecca at:\nhttps://www.whitewomanwhisperer.com \nhttps://www.patreon.com/whitewomanwhisperer\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@white_woman_whisperer?_t=8nslhOSSy8g\u0026_r=1\n\nConnect with Daniella at:\nGo Fund Me for Publishing Culting of America: https://tr.ee/FTOBLyQnYo\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/4muxbu6 / @knittingcultladychat\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nCults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://sites.libsyn.com/534892/site\nWhite Women Get Ready: https://www.mistresssyndrome.com/book\n\nKey Takeaways\n\u25CF Art as Healing and Resistance: Crafting \u0026 repurposing clothes can serve both as personal healing from trauma \u0026 as a way to resist consumerist and body-restrictive culture.\n\u25CF Purity Culture as Control: Practices like purity balls \u0026 body-based restrictions reflect patriarchal \u0026 white supremacist control, often disguised as morality or tradition.\n\u25CF Flat Stomach as \u201CPrison\u201D: Daniella critiques the societal fixation on a flat stomach as a harmful, imprisoning ideal tied to disordered eating and control of women\u2019s bodies.\n\u25CF Cults and Time Travel: Beyond \u201Cspace travel,\u201D cults often promise or enforce \u201Ctime travel\u201D\u2014keeping people fixated on returning to an idealized past or fearing an uncertain future.\n\u25CF White Culture\u2019s War on Washing: Shower control, limited bathing, and metaphors like \u201Cbrainwashing\u201D reveal deeper histories of colonization, scarcity, and body regulation.\n\u25CF Communal Bathing as Counterculture: Exposure to communal, intergenerational bathing practices fosters body acceptance and challenges shame-based conditioning.\n\u25CF Ignorance and Shame: Whiteness often weaponizes ignorance\u2014mocking or shaming people for \u201Cnot knowing\u201D\u2014rather than embracing education as ongoing growth.\n\u25CF Language Matters: Word choices carry colonial and cultural weight. Shifts in language (e.g., moving away from terms like \u201Csacred cow\u201D or \u201Cknitter\u201D) can open space for inclusivity.\n\u25CF Privilege as Managed Consequences: White privilege often shows up as having consequences absorbed or managed by others\u2014shielding people from accountability.\n\u25CF Self-Dehumanization: Systems like patriarchy and whiteness train people to see themselves as unworthy, reinforcing cycles of control and comparison.\n\nChapters\n00:00 Crafting Connections: The Art of Creation\n 02:56 The Healing Power of Crafting\n 05:49 Fashioning Identity: Clothes and Self-Perception\n 08:23 Cults and Cultural Commentary\n 11:18 The Intersection of Control and Identity\n 14:19 Purity Culture and Its Implications\n 19:36 The Control of Scarcity and Hierarchy\n 22:15 Self-Care vs. Self-Slavery\n 25:37 Deconstructing Identity and Cultural Norms\n 29:12 Patterns of Control in Cultures and Societies\n 33:17 The Impact of Purity Culture on Self-Perception\n 38:20 Communal Bathing and Body Acceptance\n 42:23 Body Image and Self-Compassion\n 43:23 Vulva Trauma and Representation\n 44:46 Cultural Ignorance and Period Stigma\n 46:52 Racial Dynamics and Cultural Identity\n 49:24 Compliments and Social Expectations\n 51:32 Emotional Responses and Social Norms\n 54:35 Privilege and Consequences\n 58:38 Language and Cultural Sensitivity\n 01:08:22 The Political Shift in Creative Spaces\n 01:11:25 Racism and Class Dynamics in Brazil\n 01:13:34 Challenging Hierarchies and Embracing Community\n 01:17:27 Redefining Living Spaces and Authenticity\n 01:21:21 The Illusion of Retirement and Life Balance\n 01:23:21 Exploitation of Labor and the Cult of Capitalism\n 01:29:10 Activism and the Power of Sitting In\nProduced by Haley Phillips",

      "description": "In this episode, Rebecca and Daniella (Knitting Cult Lady) dive into the intersections of social conditioning, cult dynamics, whiteness, and language.\nThe conversation begins with Daniella\u2019s reflections on color, identity, and creativity, connecting personal expression (knitting, design, aesthetics) to larger cultural narratives. Together, they explore how white women are socialized into \u201CSleeping Beauty\u201D and \u201Cmain character\u201D frameworks\u2014delusions that foster passivity, entitlement, and distorted views of desirability.\nFrom there, they interrogate purity culture and linguistic habits, challenging terms like \u201Cguys\u201D and \u201Cfemale\u201D while unpacking the resistance people have to changing language. They argue that words carry history, reveal cracks in social brainwashing, and shape how oppression is minimized or erased.\nRebecca and Daniella also critique systems of power from the inside\u2014military, academia, and Wall Street\u2014questioning whether representation within oppressive structures can truly lead to change when survival often requires assimilation. They highlight how women and people of color who \u201Cmake it\u201D are often forced to silence themselves to maintain those positions.\nThe episode weaves in cultural analysis, drawing from Game of Thrones, Ozark, and The Sopranos to illustrate how mainstream media normalizes cult-like manipulation, glamorizes authoritarian leaders, and conditions audiences to root for abusive systems.\nFinally, the hosts reflect on accountability in their own creative work. Daniella shares how she built \u201Cguru gotcha\u201D safeguards to avoid slipping into cult-leader dynamics herself, emphasizing the importance of self-reflection, transparency, and community in resisting power distortions.\n\nConnect with Rebecca at:  \nThe White Woman Whisperer Website: https://www.whitewomanwhisperer.com\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/whitewomanwhisperer \nThe White Woman Whisperer TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@white_woman_whisperer?_t=8nslhOSSy8g\u0026_r=1\n\n\n \nConnect with Daniella at:\nGo Fund Me for Publishing Culting of America: https://tr.ee/FTOBLyQnYo\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/4muxbu6 / @knittingcultladychat\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nCults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://sites.libsyn.com/534892/site\nWhite Women Get Ready: https://www.mistresssyndrome.com/book\n\nKey Takeaways\nSocial conditioning of white women: Narratives like Sleeping Beauty and purity culture foster passivity, delusions of desirability, and control over women\u2019s self-perceptions .\n\n\nLanguage matters: Terms like \u201Cguys\u201D and \u201Cfemale\u201D carry gendered and historical baggage; changing language takes effort but signals shifts in awareness .\n\n\nWhiteness as gated community: Whiteness creates isolated \u201Ccul-de-sacs\u201D of safety that reinforce politeness while masking violence and exclusion .\n\n\nCult dynamics in media: Stories like Game of Thrones mirror cult recruitment and manipulation, showing how narratives glamorize coercive systems .\n\n\nSilencing of women in institutions: Military culture punishes women for naming gendered experiences, causing long-term psychological fallout .\n\n\nAccountability in leadership: Daniella built \u201Cguru gotcha\u201D safeguards into her work to avoid replicating cult-like patterns\u30105\u2020source\u3011etty privilege and online dynamics**: Compliments and baiting can serve as tools of control, forcing creators into defensive positions.\n\n\nPersonal deconstruction: Haley\u2019s story of separation highlights how leaving relationships\u2014or cults\u2014requires painful reevaluation of trust, growth, and manipulation .\n\n\nResilience through community: Strong, honest friendships serve as grounding support systems during transitions \n\n\nChapters\n00:00 Colorful Expressions and Identity\n02:53 Language, Cursing, and Code-Switching\n05:57 Navigating Identity and Privilege\n08:47 Changing Systems from Within\n11:54 The Burden of Representation\n14:52 Waking Up from the Cult of Norms\n17:28 Language and Gender Dynamics\n26:54 Language and Identity: The Nuances of Communication\n29:49 The Impact of Language on Gender Perception\n34:20 Cultural Reflections: Language and Identity in Society\n38:59 Billboard Culture: The Intersection of Identity and Geography\n43:06 The Complexity of Social Interactions and Expectations\n49:00 Self-Reflection and the Challenges of Identity\n54:54 Cults and Social Dynamics: Understanding Power Structures\n56:21 Cult Dynamics and Media Analysis\n59:35 Creative Expression and Emotional Release\n01:01:00 Navigating Personal Relationships and Growth\n01:02:50 Life Changes and Community Support\nProduced by Haley Phillips",

      "description": "This episode of Cults and the Culting of America features guest Jess M. (aka White Mess Express), a former nurse, alongside hosts Daniella Mestyanek Young and Scot Loyd. The conversation explores how the U.S. healthcare system\u2014particularly nursing\u2014resembles a cult in its culture, practices, and systemic issues.\nJess describes the hierarchical \u0022rite of passage\u0022 culture in nursing (e.g., new nurses being called \u201Cbaby nurses\u201D and forced through hazing-like experiences). They highlight systemic contradictions: nurses are told to always be learning but punished for questioning authority, encouraged to self-sacrifice at the expense of their own health, and held individually responsible for systemic failures.\nThe discussion broadens to the U.S. healthcare system as a whole\u2014its prioritization of profit over care, its inequities toward marginalized groups, and the emotional toll on providers and patients alike. Daniella and Scot connect these patterns to cult dynamics: degradation rituals, infantilization, blind obedience, toxic positivity, and punishment for dissent.\nJess shares personal experiences of disillusionment: discovering nursing\u2019s promises of stability and meaning were hollow, dealing with disability from the physical demands of the work, and grieving the loss of identity and purpose after leaving the profession. They emphasize the need for gratitude toward frontline staff, patient self-advocacy, and systemic change.\nThe episode closes with encouragement: while healthcare workers may feel trapped in a \u201Ccult of medicine,\u201D deconstructing the experience allows them to reclaim their skills and narratives. Jess also shares where listeners can follow their ongoing work on TikTok and other platforms.\nDaniella\u0027s Links:\nGo Fund Me for Publishing Culting of America: https://tr.ee/FTOBLyQnYo\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/4muxbu6 / @knittingcultladychat\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\nIG: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nCults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://sites.libsyn.com/534892/site\nWhite Women Get Ready: https://www.mistresssyndrome.com/book\n\nScot\u0027s Socials\nTikTok:  @thescotloyd\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/@thescotloyd\n\nHaley\u0027s Tiktok\n@nuancedmasculinities\n\nJess\u0027s Links: \nlinktree\n\nKey Takeaways\n\u25CF Nursing culture as a \u201Ccult\u201D:\n\u25CB Hierarchical structure with forced rites of passage (\u201Cbaby nurse\u201D system).\n\u25CB Bullying, hazing, and degradation rituals normalize suffering.\n\u25CB Emotional suppression is enforced\u2014nurses must \u201Cput on a nurse face.\u201D\n\u25CB Constant demand for self-sacrifice, often leading to burnout or worse.\n\u25CF Systemic contradictions:\n\u25CB Nurses are told to always be learning, but punished for questioning authority.\n\u25CB Healthcare talks about being \u201Csystemic\u201D but punishes individuals for systemic failures.\n\u25CB Promises of good pay, benefits, and flexibility often clash with reality (mandatory overtime, long shifts, poor work-life balance).\n\u25CF Healthcare as a profit-driven business:\n\u25CB U.S. healthcare prioritizes money over patient wellbeing.\n\u25CB Marginalized groups bear the brunt\u2014Black and brown people, unhoused individuals, women, the poor.\n\u25CB Providers often have no say in pricing or systemic policies.\n\u25CF Impact on patients and providers:\n\u25CB Patients face bankruptcy, neglect, or dismissal of their concerns.\n\u25CB Providers internalize a culture of silence, mistrust, and emotional suppression.\n\u25CB Many healthcare workers avoid seeking care themselves due to stigma or normalization of suffering.\n\u25CF Breaking out of the \u201Ccult\u201D:\n\u25CB Leaving healthcare can feel like grief or loss of identity.\n\u25CB Gratitude from patients can be more meaningful than institutional rewards (\u201Cpizza party\u201D culture).\n\u25CB Patients can advocate for themselves by remembering they are the experts on their own bodies.\n\u25CB Deconstructing cult-like systems allows survivors to reclaim and repurpose their skills and experiences.\n\nChapters\n00:00 Introduction to the Healthcare System\u0027s Cult-like Nature\n 02:53 The Hierarchical Structure in Nursing\n 05:43 Systemic Issues in Healthcare\n 08:35 The Role of Nurses vs. Doctors\n 11:23 Healthcare as a Business\n 14:29 The Impact of Privilege on Healthcare Access\n 17:29 Experiences with Vulnerable Patients\n 20:20 Expectations vs. Reality in Nursing\n 23:28 Emotional Toll of Nursing and Military Service\n 28:08 Navigating Emotions in Healthcare\n 31:02 The Patient Experience: A Nurse\u0027s Perspective\n 33:45 The Reality of Nursing: Expectations vs. Reality\n 37:47 The Cult of Healthcare: A Critical Examination\n 47:34 Self-Advocacy in Healthcare: Empowering Patients\n 50:33 The Grieving Process of Leaving Healthcare\nProduced by Haley Phillips",

      "description": "In this episode, Rebecca and Daniella weave between personal stories, cultural critique, and nuanced discussions of race, privilege, and community building. Daniella shares her upcoming RV book tour, the planning quirks of packing crafting supplies, and the deliberate choice to travel through Canada to avoid unsafe environments in the U.S. The conversation pivots into an exploration of \u201Cpaperwork privilege,\u201D contrasting how bureaucratic systems treat white people versus Black people, and the mental toll of anticipating discrimination even when no harm occurs.\nThey address audience critiques\u2014particularly around Daniella\u2019s whiteness and conversational style\u2014breaking down how online perceptions can misinterpret co-host dynamics, especially in the context of shared neurodivergence and authentic dialogue. The discussion expands into how white women can make spaces safer for Black women, diversifying conversations about cults and religious extremism, and the importance of naming whiteness explicitly in spaces that claim to be inclusive. They end with reflections on small but impactful acts (like capitalizing \u201CBlack\u201D), politeness as social control, the \u201Ccompliment sandwich\u201D as manipulation, and how patriarchal systems differently incentivize men to maintain the status quo.\n\nConnect with Rebecca at:\nWebsite: https://www.whitewomanwhisperer.com/Cults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://tr.ee/IZBXVo667J\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/whitewomanwhisperer\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@white_woman_whisperer?_t=8nslhOSSy8g\u0026_r=1\nUnamerican Videobook: https://tr.ee/ODM-qtUJaR\nSecret Practice Videobook: https://tr.ee/DGEY3IeQQm\n \nConnect with Daniella at:\nGo Fund Me for Publishing Culting of America: https://tr.ee/FTOBLyQnYo\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/4muxbu6 / @knittingcultladychat\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nCults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://sites.libsyn.com/534892/site\nWhite Women Get Ready: https://www.mistresssyndrome.com/book\n\nKey Takeaways\n\u25CF Paperwork privilege: White people often get the benefit of the doubt in bureaucratic and legal systems, reducing stress and consequences in everyday interactions.\n\n\u25CF Perception vs. reality in allyship: Online audiences can misinterpret authentic, collaborative dialogue as dominance, missing the mutual respect and self-advocacy between co-hosts.\n\n\u25CF Naming whiteness matters: Acknowledging whiteness in books, clubs, and spaces creates safety for Black participants by setting clear expectations for racial discourse.\n\n\u25CF Space-making responsibility: White women can act as \u201Csecurity\u201D in shared spaces, actively intervening against behavior that would alienate or harm Black women.\n\n\u25CF Diversifying representation: Conversations about cults and religious extremism are overrepresented by white narratives; bringing in non-white voices changes the frame and content.\n\n\u25CF Everyday micro-shifts: Small acts\u2014like saying \u201Cexcuse me\u201D in public spaces or capitalizing \u201CBlack\u201D\u2014signal awareness and inclusion.\n\n\u25CF Whiteness and fear culture: In many white spaces, caring is often expressed as fear or worry, which contrasts with the joy-seeking resilience common in Black cultural spaces.\n\nChapters\n00:00 The Knitting Cult Adventure Begins\n 02:51 Planning the Crafting Road Trip\n 05:48 Navigating Travel and Identity\n 11:48 Privilege and Paperwork\n 17:38 Awareness and Consequences of Identity\n 20:45 Navigating Identity and Privilege\n 24:14 The Complexity of White Womanhood\n 29:15 Conversations on Communication and Intentions\n 34:10 Diversity in Spaces and Representation\n 38:38 The Need for Broader Narratives\n 42:43 The Importance of Representation in Storytelling\n 45:18 Navigating Whiteness and Safety in Spaces\n 47:35 Creating Safe Spaces for Black Women\n 50:32 The Dynamics of Politeness and Assertiveness\n 55:33 The Performance of Professionalism and Authenticity\n 58:19 Understanding Privilege and Exploitation in Cultures\n 01:00:18 Embracing the Learning Process Together\nProduced by Haley Phillips",

      "description": "In this episode of Cults and the Culting of America, Scot Loyd joins Haley while Daniella is away on her book tour. The conversation centers on Scot\u2019s forthcoming memoir The God I Was Given: Looking for Faith After Losing My Religion, which blends personal memoir with philosophical and scholarly reflections on growing up in the United Pentecostal Church (UPC). Scot discusses the creative and emotional risks of releasing such a personal work, particularly the fear of being misunderstood or dismissed by current UPC members.\nHe shares vivid stories from his childhood in rural Arkansas, shaped by his religious grandmother\u2019s influence and the paradox of being raised under a strong female matriarch within a patriarchal religious system. The discussion explores masculinity, gender socialization, identity loss after leaving a high-control religion, and the role of storytelling in fostering empathy and understanding. Scot emphasizes that leaving the church cost him his core identity as a \u201CPentecostal preacher,\u201D but also gave him the opportunity to discover and cultivate other talents.\nThroughout, Scot and Haley highlight the need for nuance in conversations about faith, deconstruction, and human identity, advocating for a broader cultural shift toward allowing multiple ways of being without harm.\nDaniella\u0027s Links:\nGo Fund Me for Publishing Culting of America: https://tr.ee/FTOBLyQnYo\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/4muxbu6 / @knittingcultladychat\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nCults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://sites.libsyn.com/534892/site\nWhite Women Get Ready: https://www.mistresssyndrome.com/book\n\nOther Podcasts\nDaniella\u0027s other podcast: Hey White Women\nScot\u0027s Socials\nTikTok:  @thescotloyd\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/@thescotloyd\nHaley\u0027s Tiktok\n@nuancedmasculinities\n\nKey Takeaways\nBook Launch \u0026 Themes: Scot\u2019s book is a hybrid of memoir and analysis, examining his upbringing in the UPC and the philosophical implications of faith, identity, and place.\n\n\nFear of Misunderstanding: He worries readers\u2014especially current UPC members\u2014may not engage with the book\u2019s nuance, expecting it to be more condemning than it is.\n\n\nNuance Over Binary Thinking: Scot stresses that his church experience included both positive and harmful elements, and that faith should be open to scrutiny.\n\n\nMatriarch in a Patriarchal World: His grandmother wielded significant influence despite strict religious rules limiting women\u2019s roles, creating a confusing model of gender for Scot.\n\n\nMasculinity \u0026 Socialization: Haley and Scot discuss how men raised as \u201Cchoosers\u201D in patriarchal contexts may struggle with rejection, and how rigid gender roles harm everyone.\n\n\nLoss of Identity After Leaving: Exiting the UPC meant losing his defining role as a preacher, forcing a reevaluation of self and purpose.\n\n\nStorytelling as Healing: Scot sees storytelling as a vital tool for empathy and connection, more impactful than sermons or lectures.\n\n\nValues as Identity Anchor: Both discuss grounding identity in values rather than rigid self-concepts to avoid spirals and allow personal growth.\n\n\nChapters\n00:00 Introduction and Book Announcement\n 03:27 Fears and Expectations of a New Author\n 11:25 The Influence of Geography on Faith\n 20:04 Navigating Patriarchy and Matriarchy\n 29:25 Masculinity and the Burden of Choice\n 31:30 The Burden of Expectations\n 37:48 Navigating Identity and Masculinity\n 43:09 The Power of Storytelling in Healing\n 46:34 The Cost of Leaving a Religious Identity\n 54:35 Values Over Identity: A New Perspective\nProduced by Haley Phillips",

      "description": "This episode of Cults and the Culting of America features guest Kelvin, a political scientist and community organizer, in a deep dive on whether capitalism functions as a cult and how overlapping systems like patriarchy, white supremacy, and religion have historically reinforced each other. The hosts, Scot and Daniella, explore the evolution of these frameworks\u2014from European colonialism and the doctrine of discovery to modern American politics\u2014and discuss how these systemic beliefs sustain cult-like behaviors in society. The conversation covers the historical hijacking of Christianity, education as a control mechanism, the cult of Americanism, and the psychological and political strategies that uphold oppressive systems. The episode closes with an optimistic note about generational shifts, the decline of white supremacist capitalism, and practical advice on grassroots activism.\nDaniella\u0027s Links:\nYou can read all about my story in my book, Uncultured-- buy signed copies here. https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\n \nFor more info on me:\nGo Fund Me for Publishing Culting of America: https://tr.ee/FTOBLyQnYo\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/4muxbu6 / @knittingcultladychat\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nCults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://sites.libsyn.com/534892/site\nWhite Women Get Ready: https://www.mistresssyndrome.com/book\n\nScot\u0027s TikTok\n@thescotloyd\nHaley\u0027s Tiktok\n@nuancedmasculinities\n\n\uD83D\uDD11 Key Takeaways\n1. Capitalism as a Social Framework (Not Just Economics)\n\n\u25CB Capitalism is more than markets; it\u2019s a way of being that shapes education, infrastructure, and social values.\n\n\u25CB Systems like schooling and urban planning are designed to sustain capitalist efficiency, not holistic human development.\n\n2. The \u201CCult of Americanism\u201D\n\n\u25CB American identity was built on the fusion of capitalism, patriarchy, and white supremacy, forming a powerful social order.\n\n\u25CB These ideologies served as tools to consolidate and distribute power, functioning like a macro-level cult.\n\n3. Religion as a Tool of Oppression\n\n\u25CB Early Christianity advocated communalism and equity, but the Roman Empire co-opted it into a hierarchical system for control.\n\n\u25CB Similar hijacking occurs today: religious rhetoric justifies policies that maintain systemic inequality.\n\n4. Historical Continuity of Control\n\n\u25CB From feudal Europe\u2019s restricted education to modern book bans and anti-CRT measures, elites have always used education to control narratives.\n\n\u25CB Missionary work historically served as an agent of colonialism, reinforcing white supremacist dominance.\n\n5. Cult Dynamics in Modern Politics\n\n\u25CB Donald Trump leveraged pre-existing ideological \u201Cmini cults\u201D into a cult of personality.\n\n\u25CB Fear-mongering and disinformation perpetuate obedience, especially among poor whites who vote against their own interests.\n\n6. Intersection of Racism, Class, and Patriarchy\n\n\u25CB Patriarchy incentivizes Black men\u2019s alignment with conservative politics despite racial oppression, framing it as access to power.\n\n\u25CB Economic myths\u2014like the American Dream\u2014sustain loyalty to capitalist structures even among those it exploits.\n\n7. Signs of Systemic Decline\n\n\u25CB Demographic shifts and younger generations\u2019 progressive values suggest that white supremacist capitalism is in \u201Cdeath throes.\u201D\n\n\u25CB Cults collapse when they lose control of youth\u2014an encouraging sign for future equity.\n\n8. Action Step for Listeners\n\n\u25CB \u201CFind something you care about and show up where it\u2019s happening.\u201D\nCollective action grows when individuals commit to causes aligned with their values.\n\nChapters\n00:00 Introduction and Book Launch\n03:02 Exploring Capitalism as a Social Framework\n05:44 Cults and Cultural Frameworks\n08:51 The Cult of Americanism\n11:50 Racism and Colonialism in America\n14:52 The Evolution of Christianity and Power\n17:50 Missionaries and Colonialism\n20:59 The Arrogance of White Supremacy\n23:45 Closing Thoughts on Education and Power\n29:12 The Role of Education in Society\n31:21 Questioning Authority and Personal Experiences\n35:09 The Impact of Capitalism and White Supremacy\n39:13 The Illusion of the American Dream\n43:52 The Death Throes of White Supremacy and Capitalism\n48:55 Shifts in Political Support Among Black Men\n53:25 Hope for the Future and Community Engagement\nProduced by Haley Phillips",

      "description": "In this candid and wide-ranging conversation, Daniella Mestyanek Young unpacks how cult dynamics shape everyday life\u2014from the military to motherhood, from corporate jargon to childhood punishments over \u201Cscowling at the Word of God.\u201D She and Rebecca dig into the subtle and overt ways white supremacy trains white women into compliance and calls it safety. Daniella also breaks down the coded messages in American media\u2014including her darkly hilarious theory that Winnie the Pooh is a cult.\nThrough stories of her upbringing, military career, and anti-racism work, Daniella helps listeners understand how deeply entrenched programming operates\u2014and how to begin deconstructing it. The episode invites white women to stop waiting for a dramatic \u201Cbattle vs. brunch\u201D moment and instead get honest about the slow erosion of freedom already underway. Haley, the show\u2019s producer, also jumps in to share a disturbing moment that made them stop letting their son watch Winnie the Pooh, connecting racism in children\u2019s media to the broader themes of the episode.\nConnect with Rebecca at:\nThe White Woman Whisperer Website\n \nThe White Woman Whisperer Patreon\n \nThe White Woman Whisperer TikTok\n \nConnect with Daniella at:\nGo Fund Me for Publishing Culting of America: https://tr.ee/FTOBLyQnYo\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/4muxbu6 / @knittingcultladychat\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nCults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://sites.libsyn.com/534892/site\nWhite Women Get Ready: https://www.mistresssyndrome.com/book\n\nRebecca\u2019s Links: \nWebsite: https://www.whitewomanwhisperer.com/Cults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://tr.ee/IZBXVo667J\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/whitewomanwhisperer\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@white_woman_whisperer?_t=8nslhOSSy8g\u0026_r=1\nUnamerican Videobook: https://tr.ee/ODM-qtUJaR\nSecret Practice Videobook: https://tr.ee/DGEY3IeQQm\n\n\n\uD83D\uDD11 Key Takeaways\n\u25CF Privilege is most clearly understood when it\u2019s about something like eyesight\u2014something not politicized but deeply unequal in terms of access.\n\n\u25CF \u201CWinnie the Pooh is a cult\u201D: Each character in the Hundred Acre Wood mirrors a role in coercive systems\u2014Tigger as cult leader, Rabbit as enabler, Eeyore as the depressed second-gen scapegoat.\n\n\u25CF White women are often trained to wait for either \u0027brunch\u0027 or \u0027battle\u0027\u2014but this binary thinking ignores how authoritarianism creeps in quietly.\n\n\u25CF \u201CCotton-picking\u201D language still shows up in kids\u2019 media\u2014revealing how embedded racist ideologies are in even the most innocent-seeming content.\n\n\u25CF Resting bitch face, attitude policing, and productivity metrics are all part of controlling systems\u2014whether in cults, corporations, or culture.\n\n\u25CF The military is not a monolith: Daniella challenges assumptions about who serves, who gets platformed, and who gets believed.\n\n\u25CF Accountability means being wrong out loud\u2014and using your own moments of unlearning as tools for others.\n\n\u25CF The goal isn\u2019t just to de-center men or whiteness\u2014it\u2019s to center something better.\n\n \nChapters\n0:00 The Privilege of Vision\n07:10 Cultural Reflections on Perception and Behavior\n10:08 Media, Representation, and Racial Dynamics\n12:44 The Impact of Language and Cultural Narratives\n15:46 The Role of Authority and Leadership in Communities\n18:50 Brunch Culture and Social Activism\n21:22 Navigating White Privilege and Social Responsibility\n24:21 The Dynamics of Protest and Representation\n27:12 Emergent Strategies in Social Movements\n33:35 Awakening to Systemic Issues\n34:59 Preparing for Difficult Conversations\n37:18 The Military and Representation\n39:54 Understanding Power Dynamics\n41:46 The Role of Women in Patriarchy\n44:57 The Impact of Leadership on Perception\n46:39 Recognizing Patterns of Abuse\n49:14 The Importance of Acknowledging Mistakes\n52:25 Navigating Conversations on Identity\n55:19 Empathy and Understanding in Activism\n01:02:18 Understanding Neurodivergence and Personal Growth\n01:04:48 The Dynamics of Tough Love and Communication\n01:08:41 Attention as Currency in Social Dynamics\n01:11:44 Building Unique Markets and Personal Branding\n01:16:18 Navigating Identity and Societal Expectations\n01:19:31 Skills Acquired from Cult Experiences\n01:23:37 Resistance and Survival Skills in Adversity\n01:30:14 The Legacy of Cults and Historical Figures\n01:32:54 Patriarchy and Hierarchical Structures\n01:35:17 Surviving Trauma and the Importance of Community\n01:38:06 Understanding Human Experiences Across Cultures\n01:40:43 Navigating Power Dynamics in Conversations\n01:43:41 The Role of Privilege and Proof of Purpose\nProduced by Haley Phillips",

      "description": "In this revealing and emotionally rich episode of Cults and the Culting of America, Cynthia Williams joins hosts Scot Loyd and Daniella Mestyanek Young to unpack her journey through\u2014and out of\u2014the United Pentecostal Church International (UPCI). Cynthia shares how, like many others, she once believed that her local church was different. The rules were strict, yes, but they felt spiritually justified\u2014until the cracks began to show.\nAs Cynthia puts it, the realization came slowly: \u201CI think it\u0027s probably just in the last two years\u2026 that I finally was like, wait a minute, I think I was in a cult.\u201D That moment of clarity is a turning point in the episode, as the conversation explores how UPCI and similar groups protect themselves through plausible deniability. \u201CNot my church,\u201D people say\u2014oblivious or unwilling to confront the broader systemic harm. Cynthia describes how Bible college exposed her to both a deeper version of indoctrination and\u2014paradoxically\u2014the seeds of her exit. Through theology classes and critical thinking challenges, she began questioning the very doctrines that once gave her purpose. The episode also dives into her experience witnessing the tragic death of a teenage girl at Bible school\u2014a loss that the church quickly co-opted into a martyrdom narrative, silencing Cynthia\u2019s voice and rewriting the truth. Alongside moments of grief and spiritual disillusionment, the hosts discuss cult tactics like toxic positivity, spiritual bypassing, gendered control, and the recurring pattern of falling into other high-control environments even after leaving religion. From the military to corporate America, Cynthia\u2019s story traces how these systems echo one another\u2014and how healing requires naming those echoes for what they are. With warmth, honesty, and shared survivor wisdom, this episode is a candid look at what it means to say, \u201CMaybe it was my church after all.\u201D\n \nFor more info on me:\nGo Fund Me for Publishing Culting of America: https://tr.ee/FTOBLyQnYo\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/4muxbu6 / @knittingcultladychat\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nCults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://sites.libsyn.com/534892/site\n\nKey Take-Aways\n\u25CFRules varied by pastor but enforced absolute obedience, reinforcing the illusion of autonomy while maintaining tight control.\n\u25CFWomen were subjected to extreme modesty standards, with the specifics often shifting\u2014creating confusion and deep internalization of shame and obedience.\n\u25CFPlausible deniability (\u0022not my church\u0022) was used to disguise systemic problems across UPCI.\n\u25CFWomen in UPCI were expected to be either angelic \u201Csaints\u201D or demonized \u201CJezebels\u201D\u2014no in-between.\n\u25CFWomen showing independence or intellect were often ostracized or tightly policed.\n\u25CFCynthia\u2019s racial identity and outsider status gave her marginal freedom to step outside strict gender molds\u2014but also made her invisible in some ways.\n\u25CFBible school inadvertently helped Cynthia develop critical thinking, ultimately aiding her exit.\n\u25CFLeaving the group meant not just losing community, but also certainty, purpose, and a framework for meaning.\n\u25CFLike many ex-cult members, Cynthia found herself repeatedly drawn to similarly high-control environments even after leaving UPCI.\n\u25CFThe murder of a student Cynthia mentored was mishandled by the church, which spun the event into a martyrdom narrative\u2014silencing Cynthia and distorting the truth.\n\u25CFCynthia shares how old coping strategies like breaking into church songs still emerge under stress\u2014signs of deep conditioning and dissociation.\n\u25CFDaniella highlights the concept of being an \u201Cinvisible immigrant\u201D\u2014growing up in an insular religious world without cultural references or grounding in the outside world.\n\u25CFThey celebrate the comfort and solidarity found in the \u201Cex-cult sisterhood\u201D\u2014a chosen family of people who get it.\n\nChapters\n00:00 Introduction to Cult Experiences\n 03:10 Personal Journeys in the United Pentecostal Church\n 06:01 Expectations and Restrictions for Women\n 08:46 Identifying Cult-like Behaviors\n 11:54 The Role of Education in Cult Awareness\n 15:05 Navigating Gender Dynamics in Cults\n 17:45 The Impact of Nostalgia and Shared Experiences\n 20:59 Emotional Healing and Reflection\n 23:57 Coping with Life After Leaving a Cult\n 30:20 Revisiting Trauma and Dissociation\n 31:55 Toxic Positivity in High-Control Groups\n 34:14 Tragedy and Manipulation: The Church\u0027s Narrative\n 39:40 The Impact of Violence on Faith Communities\n 43:23 Identity Crisis After Leaving the Cult\n 50:07 Life After the Cult: Finding New Paths\nProduced by Haley Phillips",

One important thing to think about with this trail is how people in the real world are processing the way people respond to it\u2013 which is why the \u201Cwhy didn\u2019t they just leave?\u201D or \u201Cshe\u2019s only in it for the money\u201D rhetoric can be so dangerous. \nSomeone in your life might be in a similar situation and decide not to disclose abuse or confide in you if you engage in this kind of victim blaming, the more the public discourse continues in this manner, the harder it becomes for people to talk about this if it\u2019s happening to them.\nMia, one of the victims (this is her pseudonym) was asked about supportive messages she sent him and why she continued to interact with him, she said \u201CI was brainwashed\u201D\nWe know Diddy bribed hotel security to get his hands on the only copy of the video of him beating Cassie up as she tries to escape. \nLaura Richards, a criminal behavior analyst summed so much of this trial and issues around coercive control up so well when she said \u201Cwhen fear is present, consent is not.\u201D\n\nAustralia: Religious Sect Faces Scrutiny\nIn Queensland, a conservative Christian sect known as \u0022The Saints,\u0022 led by Brendan Stevens, is under investigation following the death of an eight-year-old girl who was denied insulin for her diabetes. The group, which rejects modern medicine in favor of faith healing, has been labeled a cult by critics.\n\nPalm Springs Fertility Clinic Bombing\nOn May 17, 2025, Guy Edward Bartkus, a 25-year-old self-described member of a \u0022pro-mortalist\u0022 death cult, detonated a car bomb outside the American Reproductive Centers in Palm Springs, California. The explosion killed Bartkus and injured four others. Prior to the attack, Bartkus posted a manifesto declaring war against pro-lifers and criticizing IVF as epitomizing \u0022pro-life ideology.\u0022 The FBI labeled the explosion an intentional act of terrorism.\n\n\u0027Cult of Body \u0026 Soul\u0027 Podcast Investigates SoulCycle\nA new podcast titled \u0022Cult of Body \u0026 Soul,\u0022 produced by Jess Rothschild, delves into the history of SoulCycle, the high-intensity indoor cycling brand.

      "description": "This week on Cults and the Culting of America, we\u2019re turning the mic toward someone you all know well\u2014our beloved cohost, Scot Loyd. With no guest this episode, Daniella takes the opportunity to spotlight Scot\u2019s powerful personal journey and upcoming book, The God That I Was Given.\nIn an open and layered conversation, Scot reflects on his years inside the United Pentecostal Church, his rise to leadership, and what it meant to deconstruct the faith and ideologies that shaped him. He and Daniella discuss the gendered nature of cult experiences, the silence often expected of men, and how writing becomes both a weapon and a lifeline for survivors.\nThey also dig deep into the racist roots of Pentecostalism, the enduring myth of white Christian victimhood, and how cult dynamics echo through American politics today.\nWhether you\u2019ve been here since episode one or are just tuning in, this intimate episode offers a closer look at Scot\u2019s story and the broader systems of power so many of us are still trying to untangle.\nDaniella\u0027s Links:\nYou can read all about my story in my book, Uncultured-- buy signed copies here. https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\n \nFor more info on me:\nGo Fund Me for Publishing Culting of America: https://tr.ee/FTOBLyQnYo\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/4muxbu6 / @knittingcultladychat\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nCults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://sites.libsyn.com/534892/site\nWhite Women Get Ready: https://www.mistresssyndrome.com/book\n\nTakeaways\n\u25CF Even Survivors Can Be Complicit\n Scot reflects on how he not only endured harm within the United Pentecostal Church but also perpetuated it as a preacher and leader. His journey involves confronting both victimhood and complicity\u2014a nuanced look at accountability in high-control systems.\n\n\u25CF Patriarchy Shields Men from Cult Harm\u2014and From Speaking Out\n The conversation explores why fewer men write cult survivor memoirs: patriarchal systems often cushion men from the worst abuses and discourage emotional vulnerability, leaving their stories underrepresented.\n\n\u25CF Faith Deconstruction Is Not Bitterness\u2014It\u2019s Clarity\n Scot addresses the accusation that leaving high-control religion makes you \u201Cbitter.\u201D Drawing on biblical stories (like Naomi in Ruth), he reframes bitterness as a justified and even holy reaction to harm\u2014and a fuel for transformation.\n\n\u25CF Cults Mirror American Systems of Power\n The episode draws strong parallels between cult dynamics and systemic issues in the U.S., including white supremacy, evangelical nationalism, and the cult of personality around political figures like Donald Trump.\n\n\u25CF Telling the Truth Is a Radical Act\n Both hosts emphasize the importance of sharing honest, unvarnished stories to give future generations language and context for their own experiences\u2014and to challenge whitewashed versions of history.\n\n\u25CF The Tools Used to Indoctrinate Can Be Used to Liberate\n Scot talks about reclaiming the skills he developed in church\u2014preaching, writing, public speaking\u2014to critique the very systems that shaped him. Daniella echoes this with her own story, highlighting the healing power of storytelling.\n\n\u25CF Cult Experiences Are Strikingly Universal\n While each cult has its own doctrine or dogma, the episode highlights the common traits\u2014performance culture, black-and-white thinking, suppression of autonomy\u2014that unite cult survivors across backgrounds.\n\nChapters\n00:00 Introduction and Book Projects\n 03:26 Exploring Gender Perspectives in Cult Experiences\n 06:37 The Unraveling of Beliefs and Personal Reflection\n 09:27 The Role of Education in Leaving Cults\n 12:20 Writing as a Tool for Healing and Reflection\n 15:36 Navigating the Complexity of Cult Narratives\n 18:24 Confronting the Charge of Bitterness\n 21:17 The Power of Personal Stories in Cult Recovery\n 24:25 The Importance of Documenting Experiences for Future Generations\n 31:56 The Burden of Representation in Cults\n 35:18 Historical Narratives and Cultural Spin\n 39:56 The Roots of Pentecostalism and Racism\n 44:39 The Legacy of Racism in American Christianity\n 49:40 Cult of Personality vs. Cult of Ideas\n 56:11 The Current Political Climate and Its Cult-like Dynamics\n\nProduced by Haley Phillips",

Rudnev, 57, had previously been sentenced to 11 years in a Siberian prison for rape and running a sex cult. He now faces fresh charges, including human trafficking, sexual exploitation, and drug offenses. Rudnev founded the Ashram Shambala cult in 1989, manipulating mostly female followers into surrendering their assets and engaging in coerced sexual rituals. The arrest was triggered by the discovery of a frightened and malnourished young pregnant Russian woman, sparking suspicions of abuse and underage involvement. \n\nBethany Joy Lenz\u0027s Memoir Resonates with Abuse Survivors \nActress Bethany Joy Lenz, known for her role on \u201COne Tree Hill,\u201D has been receiving daily messages from women in abusive relationships following the release of her memoir, \u201CDinner with Vampires.\u201D In the book, Lenz details her decade-long experience in a controlling religious cult while working on the hit TV series. Her candid revelations about emotional abuse and manipulation have resonated deeply with readers, empowering many to confront their own situations. \nSome of the Zizians have had court appearances related to their alleged crimes\nSFGate has a headline reading Zizians Bay Area court appearance descends into chaos which seems on brand for a group that tried to kill someone with a samurai sword.\nOne of the members of the cult who is transgender has been vocal about these trials being an effort to force her to detransition, which is interesting because she\u2019s right about the pervasiveness of antitrans thinking, but the crimes were real. Could be that Ziz took advantage of her reasonable fears and manipulated them. \nDallas observer has an article about Homestead Heretige, another case of a possible cult (but definitely fringe religious group) in plane sight. \nIt has a \u201Ccheese cave\u201D (a cheese aging facility) which is advertised with billboards along the highway.

These days, I\u0027m also known as the Knitting Cult Lady. I grew up in the Children of God cult (also known as the Family International), and served 2 tours of duty in the cult of the US army.

      "description": "In this episode of Cults and the Culting of America, hosts Scot Loyd and Daniella Mesteneck Young engage in a deep conversation with Scott Okamoto, who shares his journey from evangelical Christianity to questioning the very foundations of his beliefs. The discussion touches on themes of identity, race, and the struggles of belonging within high-control groups. They explore the dynamics of critical thinking versus apologetics in Christian education, the impact of the model minority myth, and the role of empathy in Christianity. Scott reflects on his experiences teaching at a Christian university and the challenges he faced while trying to foster a more inclusive environment. The conversation culminates in a discussion about the current state of Christianity and its intersection with social justice, as well as Scott\u0027s ongoing work in helping others navigate their own journeys out of high-control groups.\n\nScott Okamoto\u0027s Links:\nSubstack: https://substack.com/@rscottokamoto\nPodcast: https://dauntless.fm/podcast/chapelprobation\nBook: https://www.amazon.com/Asian-American-Apostate-Evangelical-University/dp/1957687134/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3QP6SE2AAI1T1\u0026dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.0p-xvXdpJMmt_FA1Q-HkqRgPCiXPDvPM3EppX46bKPjZUG4WpTESenEla-l9DYyxPCkDQnVJJ9qrLZSh4WZ_1uIDAGYESVjxRR79uaOQHpd06LPxG_h4e_0I3_m3H9l4L_lb_6sOrETyVNX4bpTSvQ.JIctlVaeieZomPYqV3T5eFblD6jkharPVN3lCXVwExo\u0026dib_tag=se\u0026keywords=asian\u002Bamerican\u002Bapostate\u0026qid=1736191778\u0026sprefix=asian\u002Bamerican\u002Bapostate%2Caps%2C226\u0026sr=8-1\n\nDaniella\u0027s Links:\nYou can read all about my story in my book, Uncultured-- buy signed copies here. https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\nFor more info on me:\nPatreon: https://bit.ly/YTPLanding\nCult book Clubs (Advanced AND Memoirs) Annual Membership: https://bit.ly/YTPLanding\nGet an autographed copy of my book, Uncultured: https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\nGet my book, Uncultured, from Bookshop.org: https://bit.ly/4g1Ufw8\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/3V6GK6k / KnittingCultLady\nInstagram:  https://bit.ly/4ePAOFK / daniellamyoung_ \nUnamerican video book (on Patreon): https://bit.ly/YTVideoBook\nSecret Practice video book (on Patreon): https://bit.ly/3ZswGY8\n\nOther Podcasts\nDaniella\u0027s other podcast: Hey White Women--https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp/\n\nTakeaways\nScott Okamoto shares his experience growing up in evangelical Christianity.\nThe conversation highlights the struggles of identity and belonging in high-control groups.\nCritical thinking is often stifled in Christian education, replaced by apologetics.\nThe model minority myth complicates the experiences of Asian Americans in evangelical spaces.\nEmpathy is lacking in contemporary Christianity, as evidenced by recent teachings.\nScott\u0027s journey out of evangelicalism was gradual, marked by many small realizations.\nInterpersonal relationships can be a significant barrier to leaving high-control groups.\nScott\u0027s current work focuses on helping others navigate their experiences in Christian schools.\nThe conversation draws parallels between cult dynamics and the tech industry.\nThe hosts emphasize the importance of questioning and critical engagement in all areas of life.\nChapters\n00:00 Introduction and Acknowledgment of Social Issues\n 01:55 Scott Okamoto\u0027s Journey in Evangelical Christianity\n 06:53 Struggles with Identity and Belonging\n 10:40 The Role of Argumentation in Cults and Christianity\n 15:13 Toxic Masculinity and Church Dynamics\n 18:24 Racial Dynamics in Christianity\n 23:44 The Model Minority Myth and Its Implications\n 30:03 Recognizing Our Place in the Movement\n 31:08 The Journey of Awakening\n 32:13 The Struggle with Faith and Reality\n 35:01 The Cop-Out of Prayer\n 36:28 The Politics of Panic\n 38:57 Interpersonal Relationships and Leaving the Church\n 40:05 Finding Community Beyond the Church\n 43:30 Empathy and the State of Christianity\n 44:44 The Podcast and the Book\n 52:41 The Cult of the Tech Industry\nProduced by Haley Phillips",

      "description": "Here\u0027s an update on the Zizian cult-- which has been making headlines recently for a) being violent and b) because the media is calling it a trans cult. \n\nThis language comes from Christian nationalism, and is hateful.  It is being propagated by a cult expert who is wrong about this. \n\nTo clarify: being transgender is an identity, NOT a cult. There can and are trans people in cults (like there can be cis people in cults), and in this case we have a trans cult leader. But trans identity is not a cult. \n\nAbout Me: \nI\u0027m Daniella Mestyanek Young, scholar of cults, extreme groups, and extremely bad leadership. These days, I\u0027m also known as the Knitting Cult Lady. I grew up in the Children of God cult (also known as the Family International), and served 2 tours of duty in the cult of the US army. I noticed that those two organizations had a lot in common and have been studying them and what we can learn about other cults-- and how to protect ourselves from coercive control and abusive situations. \n\nYou can read all about that story in my book, Uncultured-- buy signed copies here. https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\n\nFor more info on me: \nPatreon: https://bit.ly/YTPLanding\nCult book Clubs (Advanced AND Memoirs) Annual Membership: https://bit.ly/YTPLanding\nGet an autographed copy of my book, Uncultured: https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\nKnitting Cult Patterns: https://bit.ly/4alDbQe\nGet my book, Uncultured, from Bookshop.org: https://bit.ly/4g1Ufw8\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/3V6GK6k / KnittingCultLady\nInstagram:  https://bit.ly/4ePAOFK / daniellamyoung_  \nUnamerican video book (on Patreon): https://bit.ly/YTVideoBook\nSecret Practice video book (on Patreon): https://bit.ly/3ZswGY8\nEtsy Store: https://bit.ly/4gewkdh\n\n#CultScholar #cultexpert #CultSurvovor #knittingcultlady #CultingofAmerica #Uncultured #groupbehaviorgal #groupbehaviorgal #Cults #CoerciveControl #Zizians",

      "description": "In this episode, Scott Loyd and Daniella Mestyneck Young engage in a deep conversation with Taylor Marie, a mental health therapist and cult survivor. Taylor shares her experiences with an online cult, discussing the similarities between online and in-person cults, the recruitment tactics used, and the psychological manipulation involved. The conversation explores the dynamics of charismatic leadership, the exploitation of belonging and purpose, and the red flags that led to Taylor\u0027s eventual departure from the cult. The discussion also touches on the importance of healthy leadership and the potential for spiritual practices to exist without devolving into cult-like behavior. In this conversation, Taylor Marie shares her harrowing experience of being involved in a cult-like astrology group, detailing the emotional turmoil and moral conflicts she faced. She discusses the manipulative tactics of the cult leader, the fear of leaving, and the subsequent backlash she received after her departure. The conversation highlights the importance of questioning authority and the role of social media in exposing harmful groups. Taylor\u0027s journey of self-discovery and the impact on her family dynamics are also explored, culminating in a powerful narrative of resilience and personal growth.\n\nDaniella\u0027s Links:\nYou can read all about my story in my book, Uncultured-- buy signed copies here. https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\nFor more info on me:\nPatreon: https://bit.ly/YTPLanding\nGet an autographed copy of my book, Uncultured: https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\nGet my book, Uncultured, from Bookshop.org: https://bit.ly/4g1Ufw8\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/3V6GK6k / KnittingCultLady\nInstagram:  https://bit.ly/4ePAOFK / daniellamyoung_ \nUnamerican video book (on Patreon): https://bit.ly/YTVideoBook\nSecret Practice video book (on Patreon): https://bit.ly/3ZswGY8\n\nOther Podcasts\nDaniella\u0027s other podcast: Hey White Women\nTakeaways\nTaylor Marie is a mental health therapist specializing in narcissistic abuse and cult recovery.\nOnline cults operate similarly to in-person cults, with differences mainly in communication.\nRecruitment often occurs through social media platforms like TikTok, using charisma and confidence.\nThe sense of belonging is a powerful tool used by cults to maintain control over members.\nCharismatic leaders often exploit followers\u0027 desires for purpose and belonging.\nRed flags include isolation from outside information and constant negative comparisons to others in the field.\nHealthy leadership promotes free thinking and allows for questioning and disagreement.\nCults often take credit for the successes of their members, creating a cycle of dependency.\nLeaving a cult can feel like a crisis, as one\u0027s worldview is challenged and dismantled.\nIt is possible to lead in spiritual practices without coercion or manipulation. The breaking point often comes when personal values clash with group beliefs.\nQuestioning authority can lead to significant personal revelations.\nLeaving a cult can involve emotional and legal repercussions.\nSocial media can amplify voices and expose harmful practices.\nThe aftermath of leaving a cult can affect family relationships.\nCult leaders often manipulate their followers through fear and guilt.\nIt\u0027s important to recognize the signs of cult-like behavior in groups.\nPersonal growth often follows the questioning of long-held beliefs.\nThe experience of leaving a cult can be isolating and traumatic.\nSupport from family and friends is crucial during the exit process.\nChapters\n00:00 Introduction to Cults and Online Communities\n 01:32 Defining Online Cults\n 05:11 The Evolution of Relationships in the Digital Age\n 07:19 Recruitment Tactics in Online Cults\n 10:18 The Dynamics of Charismatic Leadership\n 12:21 The Exploitation of Belonging and Purpose\n 14:24 Red Flags and Realizations\n 21:55 Healthy Leadership vs. Cult Leadership\n 28:21 The Crisis of Leaving a Cult\n 28:46 The Breaking Point: Values and Morals in Conflict\n 31:24 Questioning Authority: The Cult Leader\u0027s Influence\n 34:04 The Cost of Leaving: Emotional and Legal Retaliation\n 43:53 Going Viral: The Power of Social Media in Exposing Cults\n 50:17 The Aftermath: Family Dynamics and Public Scrutiny\nProduced by Haley Phillips",

      "description": "The conversation explores the topic of underwear and its role in control and oppression. It delves into the societal expectations and policing of women\u0027s bodies, the arbitrary nature of professionalism, and the intersection of underwear with race and gender. The discussion also touches on the history of underwear, the influence of capitalism and consumerism, and the connection between underwear and abuse in cults. Overall, the conversation highlights the ways in which underwear is used as a tool for control and the need to challenge societal norms and expectations. The conversation explores various topics related to identity, race, and gender. It touches on issues such as colorism, body image, breastfeeding in public, and the challenges faced by women in the military. The speakers discuss the infantilization and sexualization of women, the pressure to conform to societal expectations, and the importance of understanding and acknowledging one\u0027s own privilege. They also highlight the need for white women to listen and learn from marginalized communities, rather than trying to prove their goodness or uniqueness. In this final part of the conversation, Rebecca and Daniella discuss the insidious nature of white supremacy and the need for white people to trust Black people\u0027s awareness of racism. They also explore the importance of questioning societal norms and expectations, such as appearance control and underwear requirements. They emphasize the need for white people to deconstruct white supremacy and opt out of the game, leading to true freedom, joy, and friendship.\n\nTakeaways\n\nUnderwear is often used as a tool for control and oppression, with societal expectations and policing of women\u0027s bodies.\nThe concept of professionalism is arbitrary and can be used to marginalize and exclude certain individuals.\nThe history of underwear reveals the influence of capitalism and consumerism, as well as the infantilization of sexuality in society.\nUnderwear can be connected to abuse in cults, where it is used as a means of control and surveillance.\nChallenging societal norms and expectations around underwear is important for promoting body autonomy and dismantling oppressive systems. Colorism and body image issues are prevalent in society, leading to the infantilization and sexualization of women.\nBreastfeeding in public is still stigmatized, despite laws protecting a woman\u0027s right to do so.\nWomen in the military face challenges related to uniform fit, gender expectations, and stereotypes.\nWhite women should listen and learn from marginalized communities, rather than trying to prove their goodness or uniqueness. White people need to trust Black people\u0027s awareness of racism and understand that they know more about racism than white people do.\nQuestioning societal norms and expectations, such as appearance control and underwear requirements, is essential in deconstructing white supremacy.\nWhite people should opt out of the game of white supremacy and embrace true freedom, joy, and community.\nDeconstructing white supremacy takes time and ongoing work, and it is a continuous process of learning and unlearning.\nThe goal is not to be obsessed as white people, but to challenge and dismantle white supremacy for a more equitable society.\n\nProduced By: Haley Phillips\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@KnittingCultLady\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nRebecca\u2019s Links: \nWebsite: https://www.whitewomanwhisperer.com/Cults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://tr.ee/IZBXVo667J\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/whitewomanwhisperer\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@white_woman_whisperer?_t=8nslhOSSy8g\u0026_r=1\nUnamerican Videobook: https://tr.ee/ODM-qtUJaR\nSecret Practice Videobook: https://tr.ee/DGEY3IeQQm",

      "description": "In this conversation, Rebecca and Daniella discuss the concept of body coverage as a form of appearance control in cults and white supremacy. They explore the loaded language and thought-stopping cliches used to enforce modesty and control women\u0027s bodies. They also touch on the intersection of race and body coverage, highlighting the policing of black women\u0027s bodies and the privileging of white beauty standards. The conversation delves into the influence of cult language and the importance of challenging and deconstructing these harmful ideologies. The conversation explores the limitations placed on professional women in terms of appearance, the power of language, and the impact of beauty standards. It delves into the intersectionality of race and gender, the control and behavior prescriptions imposed by appearance standards, and the need for representation and diverse perspectives in positions of power. The discussion also touches on the troubled teen industry, the importance of storytelling and language, and the potential for change in the political landscape. The conversation explores the themes of identity, white supremacy, misogyny, and the pressure to conform to societal expectations. It delves into the experiences of being a woman and the challenges faced in navigating patriarchal systems. The speakers discuss the importance of self-acceptance and finding one\u0027s own mission in life.

      "description": "Disembodiment in cults happens when individuals lose their sense of personal identity and autonomy, becoming fully absorbed in the group\u2019s ideology and the leader\u0027s vision. Through intense indoctrination, isolation from outside influences, and suppression of personal thoughts and feelings, members gradually detach from their previous selves. They adopt the group\u2019s beliefs and behaviors as their own, which deepens their dependence on the group and diminishes their capacity for independent decision-making and critical thinking. This psychological and emotional transformation reinforces the control that the cult exerts over its members.",

      "description": "In this episode of \u0022Cults and the Culting of America,\u0022 hosts Scot Loyd and Daniella Mestyanek Young delve into the concept of charismatic leadership within cults. They begin by discussing how the idea of a charismatic leader is often associated with cults, highlighting that many of these leaders are typically perceived as white males. Daniella explains that while cults have been largely defined by white western academics, the underlying structure of patriarchy predates even white supremacy and capitalism, making it a fundamental aspect of coercive control in cults.\n\nThe conversation touches on notable examples of charismatic leaders, including Keith Raniere, David Berg, and Jim Jones, as well as Elizabeth Holmes and Adam Neumann. Daniella emphasizes that charismatic authority is not just about charm but involves qualities that make people grant these leaders extraordinary influence. She discusses how these leaders often transition from being charismatic figures to being deified by their followers, creating a system where their personal mythology becomes integral to the group\u0027s identity.\n\nScot and Daniella explore the psychological and social mechanisms that make individuals susceptible to charismatic leaders. They discuss the concept of \u0022front-of-the-room advantage,\u0022 where the mere act of being in a position of authority can make a person seem more credible and likable. They also highlight the role of rhetoric and persuasive communication in enhancing a leader\u0027s influence, noting how leaders use techniques like \u0022trance talk\u0022 to captivate and manipulate their audience.\n\nThe episode concludes with a discussion on the importance of critical thinking and diverse social connections in protecting oneself from falling prey to cult-like influence. Daniella shares her \u0022guru gotcha\u0022 checklist, a tool she developed to help identify potential red flags in leaders and groups. Both hosts stress the need for self-awareness and skepticism, encouraging listeners to examine the charismatic leaders in their lives critically. They also preview upcoming episodes, including an exploration of the role of the \u0022skinny white woman\u0022 in cult dynamics and the broader impact of group psychology on individual behavior.",

Recognize and reflect on your own privilege and the systems of white supremacy and patriarchy that perpetuate inequality.\nChallenge and dismantle oppressive systems by actively working to create change.\nEmbrace vulnerability and use your voice to spread awareness and inspire others to take action.\nQuestion and deconstruct your own beliefs and behaviors to ensure they align with your values and promote equality.\nFind ways to live authentically and resist the pressures of capitalism and societal expectations.\nUse art and creativity as a means of personal growth and self-expression.\nSound Bites\n\u0022White supremacy is like a booger\u0022\n\u0022White supremacy starts radicalizing you the second you set foot here\u0022\n\u0022Deconstructing white supremacy is a process of self-reflection and questioning\u0022\n\u0022Hey, black women, if you\u0027re alone in a conference room and someone\u0027s about to walk in and it\u0027s gonna be a white person, would you rather be a white man or a white woman?\u0022\n\u0022White women are the men of women.\u0022\n\u0022Once you can name it, you can fix it.\u0022\nChapters\n00:00Introduction and Background\n02:32Growing Up in Diverse Communities and Discovering Cult Dynamics\n05:22Creating Safe Spaces for Black People to Share with White People\n07:49Leaving Seattle and Deconstructing White Supremacy\n10:11White Supremacy as a Booger and Challenging Sacred Assumptions\n13:07The Radicalization of White Supremacy and Deconstructing Beauty Standards\n20:49The Interconnectedness of Patriarchy and White Supremacy\n25:01The Need to Stack Rank and the Impact of White Supremacy\n28:18Questioning the Cult of Capitalism and Valuing Humanization\n31:04The Con of White Supremacy and the Benefits of Equality\n37:02The Power of Vulnerability and Spreading Awareness\n48:56Living Authentically and Resisting Capitalism\n53:28Art and Creativity as Tools for Personal Growth",

      "description": "Chapter 1: A Hitler and A Churchill... (Charismatic Leadership)\n\nThis chapter begins with the story of how two kids from communes built an organization that seemed to hypnotize people out of their money. Despite all the red flags, investors flocked to the charismatic leader, and the young and hip followed him, with his pretty wife by his side, as WeWork plummeted from startup darling to embarrassment.\n\nIn this chapter, we\u2019ll take a look at the science of charisma and the process of deification that give us leaders like both Churchill and Hitler. We\u2019ll take a detour into presentation, style, and the development of what some are calling \u201Cguru voice,\u201D and see how people like Adam Newman of WeWork worked all of these quite successfully into his business persona. We\u2019ll learn how these leaders who love to think of themselves as unique actually set predictable enough patterns that they appear \u201Cto have all attended the same Messiah school,\u201D according to renowned cult expert Dr. Janja Lalich. We\u2019ll take a look at the rise of the thought leader and influencer, ever more popular with the debut of each new social media platform, and we\u2019ll explore how businesses and religions have become cults in the past.\n\nSign up here for my women\u2019s/non-binary veteran support group book club: https://tr.ee/7kETMnSylC\n\n- [ ] Get an autographed copy of my critically acclaimed memoir, Uncultured, here: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\n\nHere is where you can purchase UnAmerican , my video book, and sequel to uncultured: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal/shop/unamerican-video-book-memoir-217440?utm_medium=clipboard_copy\u0026utm_source=copyLink\u0026utm_campaign=productshare_creator\u0026utm_content=join_link\n\n- [ ] Here\u2019s my knitting cult lady store (just flip to store tab) https://linktr.ee/Daniellamyoung?utm_source=linktree_profile_share\u0026ltsid=7a4a3793-44e8-433a-8c72-e39ed754562c\n\nI\u2019m Daniella, scholar of cults, extreme groups, and extremely bad leadership.
