      "description": "In this episode we speak with Andrew Pledger who is the creator and host of Speaking Up and Surviving Bob Jones University. Andrew grew up in the Independent Fundamental Baptist Movement. He now considers his religious upbringing and the organization that he was a part of to be a religious cult. As a member of the LGTBQ community, Andrew describes the difficulty that he had with being accepted by the group that he was a part of. He created the Speaking Up podcast as a way to give a platform for others that have lived through religious abuse and religious trauma.  In doing such a project, he then created the Surviving Bob Jones University podcast where he explores the extreme teachings and behaviors of his former college.
