      "description": "In this shocking conclusion of a two-part series, Mackenzie and Hanna continue listening to Jubilee\u0027s story, whose journey takes listeners through the dangerous intersection of cult beliefs, prophetic manipulation, and emotional abuse. Jubilee begins by recounting her entry into the Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry, a religious community known for its belief in miracles and prophetic visions. Amid the indoctrination, she meets Ted, a charismatic fellow member whose grand romantic gestures and shared faith quickly draw her in. Their whirlwind romance takes a dramatic turn when a public prophecy declares Jubilee as \u0022God\u2019s gift\u0022 to Ted, cementing the belief that their union is divinely ordained, but everything is not what it seems.
