      "description": "Jim Jones was an American cult leader and mass murderer who founded and led the Peoples Temple between 1955 and 1978. In what Jones termed \u0022revolutionary suicide\u0022, Jones and the members of his inner circle planned and orchestrated a mass murder-suicide in his remote jungle commune at Jonestown, Guyana, on November 18, 1978. As a child Jim Jones was entranced with two things - Pentecostal preachers and Communism. Reflecting back on his participation in the Communist Party, Jones said that he asked himself, \u0022How can I demonstrate my Marxism? The thought was, infiltrate the church.\u0022 AND SO HE DID. He began his religious career in 1952, Jones was hired as student pastor to the children at the Sommerset Southside Methodist Church, where he launched a project to create a playground that would be open to children of all races. Jones continued to visit and speak at Pentecostal churches while serving as Methodist student pastor. He felt called to the pomp and circumstance of the Pentecostal movement. There was something about the attention that he just could not get enough of... that would lead him to start his own Church, The Peoples Temple.

The group taught a hodgepodge of Western and Eastern religious doctrines, with Hamilton-Byrne claiming to have been a reincarnation of Jesus. Classic cult move, Anne.... The group became the centre of controversy when its compound in Olinda, Victoria, was raided by police in August 1987 amid allegations of child abuse. All children were removed from the premises, and were discovered to have been adopted through illegal means. Hamilton-Byrne and her husband were eventually arrested in 1993 and charged with conspiracy to defraud and to commit perjury in relation to the adoption scams, but those charges were eventually dropped and they fled on the lamb to the Catskill Mountains of New York.

He was good at the art of the con. And if he wasn\u2019t going to be a rockstar in 1969 he was going to become famous for something else.

WWASP, deaths and lack of regulation - all stops along the winding road from Synanon. We\u2019re not talking about insects, but an organization that runs dozens of troubled teen camps across the country and the world. Their sting? Just as painful, and sometimes, even deadly.  And like, Chuck Dietrich of Synanon, we have another unqualified man ready to carry the torch of attack therapy and abuse all the way to the bank. A man by the name of Robert Litchfield, who without the benefit of a college degree, parlayed his work into a multi million dollar industry. And inspired scores of programs like his that are responsible for many horrific deaths of children, a few of which we will hear about today.  We will also hear about what Breaking Code Silence and celebrities like Paris Hilton are doing to shut these facilities down.

      "description": "Lust in the simplest of terms can be described as an intense longing, perhaps a coming of age confused - constant thought of a high school crush or a celebrity you see on TV.\u00A0 People who are in the throes of lust may lose their sensibilities, since lust seems unable to recognize the reality of a situation or motivates one to neglect it. It\u2019s a excuse that can be slightly valid in the most innocent of cases but there\u2019s a fine line between a crush, and lust crossing dangerously over into stalking, non consent, or even worse violent sexual assault. But the crush excuse or innocent lack of \u201Csensibility\u201D in the moment does not describe the subject of this season\u2019s lustful lecher Pastor Matt Baker.\u00A0 No, in fact he was callous, unashamed, and unapologetic in his pursuit to control and take what he felt he deserved.\u00A0 He \u201Cordained\u201D the time or place of the encounter. He sought to conquest and manipulate,\u00A0 but mostly barrel his way into groping or finding the most disgusting of times to violate innocent teens, women, and overall, everyone that knew him.\u00A0 But the person he manipulated, gas lit and violated the most was his unbelievably devoted wife, who\u2019s life was destroyed by her husband Matt Baker...

      "description": "Jim \u0026 Tammy Faye Bakker broke into television in the heyday, when no medium could rival the Christian ripoff off of Mr. Rogers Neighborhood. Their televangelist show thrived at appealing to the sensibilities of bible belt stay at home wives with kids. The ratings soared and so did the ministry donations leaving Jim and Tammy in control of more money than they\u0027d ever even thought of... but they knew just how to spend it. They went as far as breaking ground on a half baked attempt at a Christian Disneyland before envy got the best of an opportunistic rival in the ministry game: Jerry Falwell; and he was seeking to banish them from God\u0027s stage forever.\u00A0 Sex, Drugs, and millions of stolen dollars are at the heart of this sordid Evangelical story.\u00A0 And it wasn\u0027t just the predatory sexual encounter he had with 19 year old Jessica Hahn that landed him in jail, it was a forensic accounting look into his fraudulent use of viewers donations.\u00A0 You\u0027d think he\u0027d spend his life repenting but no no, Jim Bakker is still to this day grifti-ng his way into vulnerable people\u0027s pockets selling end of times kits and Coronavirus cures.\u00A0  SOURCES- PTL: The Rise and Fall of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker\u0027s Evangelical Empire -Book by John H.
