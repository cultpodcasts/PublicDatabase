      "title": "From Cult-Controlled to CEO: The Power of Choosing Again",
      "description": "Jasmine Chambers had built what looked like a faithful life: leadership roles, four children, community respect. But beneath the surface, she was dreaming of disappearing. Raised in a highly-controlled religious environment that would later be classified as a cult, Jasmine had learned to silence her inner voice and follow external authority. Until the night she and her husband loaded their four children into a truck and drove toward the unknown. It\u2019s a story rooted in the messy, years-long work of undoing a lifetime of conditioning while simultaneously building something entirely new. From getting her high school diploma at 31 to launching a luxury home-building company, Jasmine reveals the real cost of living someone else\u0027s version of your life, and the power that comes from choosing your own dreams, again and again.
