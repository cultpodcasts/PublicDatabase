      "description": "Today we\u0027re taking a close look at Monat and uncovering some sketchy and concerning things. We\u0027ll go over what it takes to join Monat, their (supposedly the most competitive) compensation plan, their \u0022free car\u0022 program, the products, the outrageous claims of these products, and the lawsuits that Monat is facing. As always, my goal is to inform and educate, never to belittle or harm. My issue with MLM companies is and always will be regarding their bad business practices, and is never about the people in these MLMs.\n\nFAIR USE - Copyright Disclaimer under Section 107 of the copyright act 1976, allowance is made for fair use for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarship, and research.
