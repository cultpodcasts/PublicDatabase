      "title": "The Real Story Behind Wayward: My Time Inside the School That Inspired a Netflix Nightmare",
      "description": "Everyone\u2019s talking about Netflix\u2019s new series Wayward \u2014 but for me, it\u2019s not just entertainment. It\u2019s my life story. In this deeply personal episode, I break down what\u2019s real and what\u2019s made for TV in the hit series \u2014 because I actually lived it. Long before Wayward became a pop culture obsession, I attended CEDU, the original \u201Ctherapeutic boarding school\u201D that inspired this world. I graduated from its first campus, endured its methods, and witnessed firsthand how a program built on healing was actually rooted in Synanon, a 1960s cult known for psychological control and emotional abuse. Watching Wayward sent me into full-blown PTSD \u2014 not because it\u2019s fiction, but because it\u2019s frighteningly accurate. If you\u2019ve been bingeing the series and find yourself wondering how much of it could really happen\u2026 this episode is for you. \u0026#x1f4a1; In this episode, you\u2019ll hear: \u2022 What was real in Wayward \u2014 and what was dramatized for TV \u2022 The shocking history of CEDU, the program that inspired an entire industry of \u201Ctroubled teen\u201D schools \u2022 How the Synanon cult shaped the foundation of emotional-growth education \u2022 The disturbing practices that students endured in the name of therapy \u2022 The lasting trauma \u2014 and what healing looks like when you finally tell the truth --- --- --- PLEASE LIKE, SHARE, SUBSCRIBE, AND GIVE US A 5-STAR REVIEW!: ratethispodcast.com/missunderstood Become a Patreon Member: https://www.patreon.com/c/MissUnderstoodwithRachelUchitel Shop Miss Understood Merch https://missumerch.com/ \u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060Follow Rachel on Instagram!\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060 https://www.instagram.com/racheluchitelnyc/?hl=en Follow Rachel on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@itsracheluchitel Executive Producer: \u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060George Carmona Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/miss-understood-with-rachel-uchitel/exclusive-content Advertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brands Privacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

      "description": "She had a thriving restaurant, a cult following, and a mission to change the way people eat. Then, almost overnight, Sarma Melngailis became the woman at the center of Bad Vegan \u2014 a Netflix scandal that made headlines but missed the real story. Now, in her brand-new memoir The Girl with the Duck Tattoo, Sarma is reclaiming the narrative. And in this in-person interview \u2014 recorded live in New York City \u2014 she opens up to me like never before. This episode isn\u2019t about viral fame or courtroom drama. It\u2019s about the slow unraveling of identity, how coercive control works, what it takes to survive psychological abuse, and how one woman is writing her way back to herself. \u0026#x1f4a1; Why it matters: This isn\u2019t just a story about scandal. It\u2019s a story about control, recovery, and how smart women can still be broken down \u2014 and also built back up. \u2E3B \u0026#x1f517; CONNECT WITH SARMA \u0026#x1f4d8; The Girl with the Duck Tattoo \u2013 https://www.amazon.com/Girl-Duck-Tattoo-Memoir/dp/1544548982 \u0026#x1f4f8; Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sarmamelngailis/ \u2E3B \u2764\uFE0F Loved this conversation?
