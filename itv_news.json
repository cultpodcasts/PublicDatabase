The former prince has always denied any wrongdoing.\n\nMs Giuffre took her own life in April 2025.\n\nIn an interview with ITV News, her brother Sky Roberts was joined by his wife Amanda.\n\nThey called on the Metropolitan Police to re-open its investigation into the allegations against Mr Mountbatten-Windsor relating to Virginia Giuffre.\n\nA statement released by the force in December last year said: \u201CA decision was made in November 2016 not to proceed to a full criminal investigation. That decision was reviewed in August 2019 and again in 2021 and 2022; in each instance, the position remained unchanged, and Ms Giuffre and her legal representative were informed.\n\n\u201CFollowing recent reporting suggesting that Mr Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor asked his Met Police close protection officer to carry out checks on Ms Giuffre in 2011, the MPS has carried out a further assessment. This assessment has not revealed any additional evidence of criminal acts or misconduct.\u0022\n\nBuckingham Palace has said it will assist with any inquiries relating to the King\u0027s brother, in relation to a Thames Valley Police investigation relating to misconduct in a public office.\n\nThe pair also spoke about Lord Mandelson, and said that he had questions to answer over his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nHe has previously given the following statement: \u0022I was never culpable or complicit in his [Epstein\u2019s] \rcrimes.
