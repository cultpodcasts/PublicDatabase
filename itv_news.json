      "description": "A survivor of the serial paedophile Jeffrey Epstein has given her first on the record interview telling ITV News how the disgraced financier tried to lure her to a dinner with a member of the British Royal family. \n\nAnn Fisher says she was assaulted by Epstein in May 2001 at his Upper East Side mansion in New York, having gone to what she thought was a business meeting. \n\nAfter talking for some three hours, he invited her to an upcoming dinner with a member of the Royal family where he said she would fit in well as Fisher is half English and according to Epstein, resembled Princess Diana. \n\nEpstein then attacked her. He later offered her a cheque which she refused. In the subsequent days, one of Epstein\u2019s assistants repeatedly called her, on her mobile phone, her work phone and her home phone, pestering her to attend the dinner. \n\n\u2022 Subscribe to ITV News on YouTube: http://bit.ly/2lOHmNj \n\u2022 Get breaking news and more stories at http://www.itv.com/news\n\nFollow ITV News on TikTok https://www.tiktok.com/@itvnews?lang=en\nFollow ITV News on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/itvnews/\nFollow ITV News on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/itvnews/ \nFollow ITV News on X: https://twitter.com/itvnews",
