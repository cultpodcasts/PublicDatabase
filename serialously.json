      "description": "In today\u0027s episode, we delve into the DISTURBING new allegations and reports that have surfaced regarding Ruby Franke, known for her Family Vlogger YouTube channel \u00228Passengers,\u0022 which followed the life of her Mormon family. \u201C8Passengers\u201D blew up and quickly gained a following of over two million subscribers. However, not long after becoming a household name, her online audience started questioning her parenting style and whether family vloggers, in general, are problematic. The YouTube channel was eventually shut down, and instead, Ruby was involved in a parenting advice podcast called Connexions with Jodi Hildebrandt, a close friend and therapist. Ruby and Jodi were arrested last week in Ivins, Utah. Police alleged in a statement that one of Ruby\u2019s children escaped Jodi\u2019s house and ran to a neighbor, asking for food and water. Authorities say officers then found another young child who also appeared \u201Cmalnourished\u201D inside Jodi\u2019s home. Both children showed signs of being taped and tied up. This is an ongoing investigation. All of the case facts in this podcast episode are alleged and cited by court documents, and anything else is my opinion only.\u00A0   Your True Crime BFF, Annie Elise  Merch Drop Link: https://shop10tolife.com/\u00A0 All Social Media Links\u00A0 https://www.flowcode.com/page/annieelise_ About Me: https://annieelise.com/ SERIALously FB Page: https://www.facebook.com/SERIALouslyAnnieElise/ For Business Inquiries:\u00A0 10toLife@WMEAgency.com    ",
