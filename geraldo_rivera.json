Jentzsch and author Steve Hassan.\n\n\u0022Do you sir, allege that Scientology is a destructive cult?\u0022\n\nThis segment largely begins with a response to a recent Time magazine article which accused the religous organization of being less than scrupulous.  We hear from Scientologists in the audience, as well as from Monica Pignotti a former member and confidante of L. Ron Hubbard.\n\nIn 2025, the controversy continues.  Scientology - religion to help millions around the world to a better life, or extortionist cult benefiting those at the top?\n\nThis day, Geraldo\u0027s television history.",

      "description": "1991.  Geraldo Rivera on his Now It Can Be Told program investigates \u0027JR\u0027, or John Roger, who has built a multi-million dollar tax exempt empire around his claim to holiness.  Mr. Roger says he was endowed with godly powers during kidney stone surgery in 1963, and he could teach other mortals to use power of the mind in acquiring worldly goods.\n\n\u0027The Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness\u0027, or MSIA has devotees living at a seminary in Los Angeles, and this church of John Rogers has also attracted some very high profile Hollywood personalities.  The school he founded, the University of Santa Monica, offers Insight Seminars which are popular in the United States and around the world.  Attendees are frequently sent by federal agencies, including the Navy and the Social Security Administration.\n\nLater in the segment we hear from the Cult Awareness Network about the MSIA, and throughout are former disciples, defectors and others familiar with this shadowy network of holy man and tax money.  John Rogers did not want to answer any questions and when found at one of his book signings laughed off the questions.\n\nThe MSIA, Univeristy of Santa Monica, and Insight Seminars all still exist today in 2025.  John Rogers passed away in 2014, age 80.",

This exclusive sit-down with the madman uncovers a lot of his criminal mindset.  Serial killer, cult leader....is he a \u0027sane\u0027 trickster or legitimately psycho?  We start with about 1 minute of recap, before Charlie recounts his childhood and world view.  The interview moves on to various aspects of blaming society for wanting him to be the evil man, to \u0027not being guilty of anything\u0027, to his relationship with his followers and how it began.\n\n\u0022I\u0027m in paradise..\u0022 \n \n\u0022I\u0027m the lawmaker...\u0022 \n\nIn the course of this interview Charlie admits having influenced \u0027the kids at the ranch\u0027 but denies responsibility for the 7 murders that put him in prison. \n\nCharles Manson died at age 83, after 4 decades behind bars.",

      "description": "1990.  On his namesake talk show, Geraldo Rivera hosts Patricia Ryan, the daughter of deceased congressman Leo Ryan.  This clip starts with a look at  the \u0022Peoples Temple\u0022, an allegedly religious movement known for a mass death event at their remote location in Guyana, 1978.  Footage is shown of the location as it was later found by the government of Guyana.  We then hear from daughter Patricia Ryan about what it was like to grow up the midst of these events, losing her father.  \n\nThese events occured in 1978.\n\nCongressman Leo Ryan led a fact finding mission to \u0027Jonestown\u0027 amid reports of involuntary confinement and even murder of the followers there.  On his initiative a large group went to Guyana, including concerned family members of the Jonestown followers.  Upon his departure Congressman Ryan was gunned down by fanatical \u0022People\u0027s Temple\u0022 followers, along with four others, hours before the mass death event killed over 900 people at Jonestown itself. \n\nLarry Layton, likely the first to open fire inside of Congressman Ryan\u0027s departing cessna, was convicted in 1987 of aiding and abetting the murder of the Congressman as well as other crimes.  He served 18 years in prison and was released from custody in 2002.\n\nIn total five people were murdered at Port Kaituma under Jim Jones direction, including Congressman Leo Ryan, as their plane was preparing for departure.\n\nFour others committed suicide at a People\u0027s Temple facility in Georgetown, the capital of Guyana.\n\nHours later 909 cult members died at the Jonestown facility after consuming a grape flavor-aid beverage laced with poisons.  Many were likely injected against their will.",
