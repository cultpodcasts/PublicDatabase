Anouska De Georgiou is a former model and actor who testified in court in 2019  in a special hearing by a US judge to allow victims their chance to be heard, after Epstein took his own life. Anouska was a close friend of Virginia Giuffre. Ms Guifree accused Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein of sexual abuse, and died by suicide in April, aged just 41. \n\nVirginia Giuffre claimed Prince Andrew had sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was 17, allegations he has repeatedly denied. The Prince settled a civil sexual assault case brought against him in the US by Virginia Giuffre. The out-of-court settlement said the Duke - who made no admission of liability - would pay an undisclosed sum to Ms Giuffre. Prince Andrew said in an interview with this programme that he had no recollection of ever meeting Ms Giuffre.\n\nMs De Georgiou talks to Victoria about the legacy of Virgina Giuffre. She is also joined by physician and author\u00A0Gabor Mat\u00E9 to the discuss trauma and living with its impacts.\n\nNewsnight is the BBC\u0027s flagship news and current affairs TV programme - with analysis, debate, exclusives, and robust interviews. \n\nWebsite: https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsnight\nX: https://twitter.com/BBCNewsnight\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@newsnightbbc\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/newsnightbbc\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/bbcnewsnight",
