      "description": "The details of Keith Raniere\u0027s shadowy reign as the leader of NXIVM, which has for years withstood allegations that it was a cult-like criminal enterprise, are expected to be fully revealed at his federal criminal trial in May.  Raniere, long known to his followers as \u0022Vanguard,\u0022 has for more than two decades been a captivating figure after founding the Capital Region-based organization that amassed thousands of followers and pledged to help \u0022humanity rise to its noble possibility.\u0022  But behind the programs that promised executive success and self-empowerment, Raniere\u0027s penchant for manipulating those who believed in him, especially the many women who would become his sexual partners, would lead to last year\u0027s collapse of NXIVM.  All these issues and more are covered by Times Union investigator editor Brendan Lyons for the first episode of the \u0022NXIVM on Trial\u0022 podcast series. Learn more about your ad choices.
