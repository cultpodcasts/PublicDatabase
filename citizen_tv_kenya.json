      "description": "Tonight, we unravel how controversial pastor Paul Mackenzie acquired the Shakahola cult farm using elders from the 5 clan groups that claim ownership of more than 100,000 acres of the Chakama ranch in Kilifi County. Emmanuel Mwaro one of the signatories to an agreement says Mackenzie doesn\u2019t own the land but only paid 500,000 shillings for a one-year stay commonly known as Kajama. \nIn an exclusive agreement in our possession Mackenzie initially wanted to settle in and use 800 acres before changing his mind and opting for a 500-acre piece of land. And as Francis Mtalaki reports top security officers were aware of the transactions and at some point accompanied Mackenzie for his mission in the forest.",
