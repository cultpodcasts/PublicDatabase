Emmanuel Mwaro one of the signatories to an agreement says Mackenzie doesn\u2019t own the land but only paid 500,000 shillings for a one-year stay commonly known as Kajama. \nIn an exclusive agreement in our possession Mackenzie initially wanted to settle in and use 800 acres before changing his mind and opting for a 500-acre piece of land. And as Francis Mtalaki reports top security officers were aware of the transactions and at some point accompanied Mackenzie for his mission in the forest.",
