Out of eight senators in the Committee, three senators excused themselves, and five voted for the bill. \n\nSenate Bill 360 requires Clergy to Report Child Abuse and Neglect Under Any Circumstancess. Although current law includes clergy members in the list of 46 professionals to report, the law also exempts clergy from such reporting if they gain their knowledge or suspicion of the crimes during \u201Ca penitential communication.\u201D\n\nSee also\n\n\u0022Two witness rule\u0022. According to Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses if a child abuse victim makes an accusation the congregation will refuse to accept it unless there is a second witness.  It will never be reported to the police. \n\nhttp://jwfacts.com/watchtower/paedophilia.php\n\nJehovah\u0027s Witnesses have been hiding thousands of pedophiles in their congregations and allowing them to reoffend. The Australia Royal commission has been investigating them only to uncover their disgusting fruitage of a demonic Spirit. This organization is pushed by heavy cult influence while claiming godly authority.
