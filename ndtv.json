      "description": "Rina Oh, a survivor of Jeffrey Epstein\u0027s abuse, speaks to NDTV about how she was targeted at age 21, the lasting trauma of earlier childhood abuse that made her vulnerable, and the moment she decided to walk away after Epstein turned violent. Now one of the most vocal survivors, Rina says the U.S. government has not done enough-and calls the recent action involving former UK Prince Andrew a necessary step toward accountability. In this candid conversation, she reflects on survival, silence, justice, and why powerful men linked to Epstein must finally answer for their actions.\n\n#EpsteinFiles #EpsteinScandal #JeffreyEpstein #EpsteinFilesFallout #EpsteinSurvivor #RinaOh \n\nAbout NDTV (English news channel):\r\n\r\nNDTV is India\u0027s Most-Trusted News Broadcaster with the latest updates in news, sports, entertainment and much more from within India and around the world.
