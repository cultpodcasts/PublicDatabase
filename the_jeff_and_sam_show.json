      "description": "It\u0027s spooky season so it\u0027s getting dark. This week Sam recounts the harrowing story of the Kurim case, a horrific child abuse scandal that emerged in the Czech Republic in 2007. This gripping story unveiled a clandestine cult shrouded in manipulation and cruelty, as well as the shocking revelation of a 33-year-old woman who was ...hiding a secret. The case first came to light in May 2007 when a man in Kurim inadvertently intercepted his neighbor\u0027s baby monitor signal. What he witnessed was nothing short of horrifying: unsettling images of a naked and bound young boy named Ondrej, imprisoned in a cupboard.
