      "description": "In this conversation, Anne L Peterson, Brian Nord, and Erik Rojas discuss their experiences with Landmark Worldwide, a high control organization. They explore the challenges of leaving such an environment, the impact of speaking out publicly about their experiences, and the emotional and mental struggles that come with questioning long-held beliefs. The discussion highlights the importance of community, the complexities of personal development, and the courage required to confront the darker aspects of self-help organizations.TAKEAWAYS: ** The transition from being a part of a high control organization to leaving it is complex and emotionally challenging.** Speaking out about personal experiences can lead to healing and community support.** Many individuals in high control organizations struggle with questioning their beliefs and experiences after leaving.** The culture within organizations like Landmark can lead to emotional and physical abuse, which is often normalized.** Finding a new community after leaving a high control organization can be a significant source of healing.** The tools and teachings from self-help organizations can be both beneficial and harmful, depending on the context.** It\u0027s essential to recognize and address exploitation within self-help and personal development spaces.** Courage to question long-held beliefs is crucial for personal growth and recovery.** The impact of leaving a high control organization can affect personal relationships and mental health.** Recovery is an ongoing process that requires time, reflection, and support.RESOURCES \u0026 LINKS Watch Brian and Erik\u2019s show \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0/\u00A0@howdidigetherechannel\u00A0\u00A0 If you or someone you know is wrestling with recovery after being involved in a high-control group, relationship or any organization, check out the Healthy Healing and Recovery Group w/ Rachel Bernstein https://ilumn8.life/op/lgat-recovery-...

      "description": "In this conversation, Kari Bunn, a survivor of the controversial \u0022troubled teen\u0022 school C.E.D.U., joins Anne Peterson to unpack the complexities of the troubled teen industry. Together, they explore the duality of these programs\u2014shedding light on the mix of emotional growth promises and harmful practices rooted in celebrity culture, self-help movements, and coercion.\nTheir dialogue dives into personal stories, the trauma of misguided therapeutic methods, the role of documentaries in shaping public perception, and the lasting impact on survivors. With a focus on healing, awareness, and community, this conversation emphasizes the importance of learning from past abuses to foster healthier approaches to personal growth and therapy. \n\nSUPPORT Kari and her colleagues to get their documentary made. \nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cedudocumentary/cedu-documentary \n\nCONNECT to Kari https://www.facebook.com/kari.bunn \n\nCELEBRATE some recent accomplishments. \nParis Hilton has made it her mission to empower the survivors of these schools after her own traumatic experiences as a student. https://parishilton.com/paris-impact-work/ \n\nHilton is the force behind the Stop Institutional Child Abuse Act, which passed the House and Senate last week. The legislation creates a federal work group on youth residential programs to oversee the health, safety, care, treatment and placement of minors in rehab and other facilities. The new law is personal for Hilton, who has testified before Congress that she faced abuse in such facilities as a teen. \n\nhttps://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1351?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22Stop\u002BInstitutional\u002BChild\u002BAbuse\u002BAct%22%7D\u0026s=1\u0026r=1\n\n\nWHAT is CEDU \n\nIn 1967, Mel Wasserman and his wife Brigitta founded CEDU Educational Services, Inc in California. Mel Wasserman had previously sponsored recovering addicts at nearby Synanon and highly regarded Charles E. Dederich. The name, CEDU, was thought to be an acronym for \u201CCharles E. Dederich University.\u201D Several Synanon acolytes worked at CEDU such as Bill Lane who was one of Synanon\u2019s first and youngest members. In fact, Dr. Frank Seixas wrote an endorsement letter of CEDU in 1972 which acknowledged that Mel Wasserman had experience with Synanon and modeled CEDU\u2019s \u201Ctherapy\u201D after it. When Synanon later fell out of favor in the public eye due to its criminal activities, Mel Wasserman would claim that the name CEDU had nothing to do with Synanon and instead stood for \u201CSee yourself as you are and do something about it.\n\nThe average time that children would attend CEDU was 2.5 years. The program did not believe in the use of medicine or most traditional therapy. Punishment such as hard labor, isolation, attack group sessions, etc was often used. At least three times a week, students were required to attend \u201Crap\u201D  sessions \u2013 which were attack pseudo-psychology sessions led by untrained staff. These were very similar to Synanon\u2019s \u201CGame.\u201D Students also were required to attend multi-day workshops called \u201CPropheets\u201D \u2013 similar to Synanon\u2019s \u201CThe Trip.\u201D\n\nCEDU would later branch out and open up multiple schools in California and Idaho until their closure in 2005. Multiple CEDU spinoff programs were created by former staff and students and some continue to operate to this day using the same structure and methods as the original CEDU.  \n\nRead more https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEDU \n\n\nGENERAL RESOURCES \u0026 LINKS \nRead Anne\u2019s Book Is This A Cult: Confronting the Line Between Exploitation and Transformation https://a.co/d/7uoGYRs \n\nIf you or someone you know is wrestling with recovery after being involved in a high-control group, relationship or any organization, check out the Healthy Healing and Recovery Group w/ Rachel Berstein https://ilumn8.life/op/lgat-recovery-group/ \n\nMODERATION NOTE: \nWhile healthy debate and discussion regarding the topics being discussed is encouraged, personal (ad hominem) attacks on people, places or things will be deleted. \n\nFINALLY \nPlease consider supporting this channel which helps us to offer more and better content and resources.

It is legendary in the Landmark/Werner Erhard circles. The discussion covers the program\u0027s history, structure, and the experiential learning processes involved. While we have found many stories about the dangers of the est training and the Forum, we have heard almost nothing but huge praise for the course known as the 6 Day.

      "description": "In this episode, we explore the concept of weaponized empathy. We look at how empathy can be manipulated and used as a tool for control with the end justifies the means argument and how this moral theme is common in high-control groups, cults or culty groups and extremist ideologies. And what about the weaponization of empathy in the context of misinformation and narcissism? Often these people then become true believers who go to extreme lengths to spread the group\u0027s message and defend it, often causing harm to themselves and others in the process. We discussed how to recognize and protect oneself from being taken advantage of by weaponized empaths who mean well. In this part of the conversation, Chris discusses the process of deprogramming and deconstructing cult mindsets. He emphasizes the importance of physical safety, resources, and a support network in the early stages of leaving a cult. He also highlights the need for post-cult education and self-work to undo the indoctrination and build resilience.

      "description": "Chris Shelton MSc, Scientology survivor and coercive control expert joined us as guest this week. We had fun exploring the similarities between Scientology and Landmark Worldwide, two organizations that are known for their controversial practices and being accused of cult-like behavior. Similarities such as the cult-ish personalities around the founders, L. Ron Hubbard and Werner Erhard, and the lack of accountability of such leaders. We also talked about the tactics used like emotional manipulation, the suppression of questioning, the power of social proof and the manipulation of beliefs. PLUS the influence of other cult leaders on Landmark and Scientology is undeniable. We compared the practices and beliefs of Landmark and Scientology. Landmark focuses on transformative learning and removing barriers to self-expression, while Scientology believes in the spiritual nature of humans and aims to remove past life trauma. Anything for a tax write off?! The goal of Landmark is to \u201Ctransform the being of human being\u201D and Scientology is to \u201Cclear\u201D the planet. What\u2019s the difference? Still searching. We discovered more similarities, such as the concept of recreation where individuals are trained to fully understand and duplicate another person\u0027s communication and the control mechanisms used in communication exercises in general. Well, Werner does acknowledge L. Ron in his authorized biography. Chris didn\u2019t have any first hand knowledge of the supposed Scientology conspiracy to discredit Werner, beyond his being labeled a squirrel \u0026#x1f43f;of course. He did give us some insider history of Scientology\u0027s infiltration operations into the IRS and political organizations for the purpose of influencing on a larger scale. Finally the conversation concludes with a discussion on the importance of recognizing and educating ourselves about manipulative tactics in order to protect our autonomy and rights.

      "description": "Welcome back Ed! In this conversation with our resident transformational technologies expert Ed Gurowitz we cover various topics including cult dynamics, the power of influence, the illusion of scarcity, and the impact of directed sharing. We also touched on the creation of special groups within an organization and the role of scarcity in creating value. The absorption of a powerful person\u0027s way of being into a group and the competition to be part of that group is covered. AND explore the concept of directed sharing and the manipulation of natural human tendencies. Overall, the conversation highlights the importance of awareness and critical thinking in navigating these dynamics. Who is Ed? Ed Gurowitz, Ph.D. is a psychologist who has been on the leading edge of personal and organizational transformation for over 40 years.

We also examine the limitations of external interventions in communities and the importance of empowering individuals to develop their own solutions. The conversation highlights the need to challenge and dismantle oppressive systems and create inclusive spaces that respect diverse perspectives and experiences. We also examine the idea of self-made success and the role of privilege in achieving it. The need for a more collective and inclusive approach to personal development, rather than an individualistic one is highlighted. Again we emphasize the importance of questioning and critically examining the practices and beliefs within the self-help (aka personal development) industry.

      "description": "\u0022Dominance hierarchies, structures that are about people having power over other people inherently are to be questioned.\u0022 ~ Exene Paloma In this conversation we question the power and privilege dynamics in the personal development space, with a focus on the Landmark Forum. Our guest, Exene Paloma, shares the experience as a former Landmark staff member and course supervisor. The conversation explores the hierarchical structure and power dynamics within Landmark and similar organizations. It discusses the influence of the source (Werner Erhard) and how his personality and ideas shape the culture of the organization. The conversation also delves into the concept of dominance hierarchies and the belief that power structures built on people having power over others are inherently flawed. Exene expresses skepticism towards top-down culture change and emphasizes the importance of empowering individuals and building structures that promote equality. In part of the conversation, Exene and Anne explore some of the manipulative tactics used in self-help programs, highlighting how these programs create an artificial environment to elicit emotional responses and then sell products or services. They also discuss the concept of integrity and how it is used as a tool for control and touch on the power dynamics within these programs and the pressure to conform to group norms. They also discuss the transferability of the insights gained in these programs to real-life situations and the limitations of self-help in addressing systemic issues. Finally, they draw parallels between self-help and marketing, highlighting the focus on personal improvement and the perpetuation of feelings of inadequacy for the purpose of ongoing sales.

He tells us about his personal experience in a seminar where abusive tactics were used by the trainer.\n\nIn this discussion he emphasizes the importance of critically evaluating information from these groups and the challenges of researching and publishing on this topic. The conversation made us aware of the psychology of group identity and the tendency to defend and identify with a group, even when faced with conflicting information.\n\nDr. John highlights the euphoria, confidence, and impulsivity that participants often experience after completing a large group awareness training. He draws attention to the common elements found in many of these groups, such as specific exercises, lots of rules, and the pressure to recruit others. \n\nThe discussion raises concerns about the potential exploitation and psychological impact of LGATs, highlighting the similarities between different large group awareness training seminars and the potential risks associated with them. He shares his personal experience with bipolar disorder and how it influenced his interest in studying these seminars. \n\nCONTENT NOTE \n\nThis video contains some discussion about mental health outcomes of both bi-polar disorder and LGATs.

      "description": "Mark and I took some time this weekend to discuss our experience and reactions to the recent revelations and stories that have emerged related to abuse at Landmark and the personal development world. We reflect on the impact of my book, \u0027Is This a Cult?\u0027, and the surprising response of the many #samehere experiences. We continue to emphasize the importance of telling the truth, exposing abuse, and creating healing spaces. \n\nWe also address the contentious discourse that has arisen in the Landmark community as a response to the many revelations being shared. We believe it is important to give space and grace to people who are speaking up, including our guests, even if it gets messy. We remind ourselves and others that anger has a role in the healing process and we recognize the need to hold boundaries while processing emotions. This requires learning how to understand and communicate our needs. Listening to learn is key to the process.\n\nWe wrap up talking about the need for transparency and accountability in organizations and the value of seeking truth and understanding. \n\nRESOURCES \u0026 LINKS\n\nMarks discussion on \u201CHow Did I Get Here\u201D with Brian Nord \u0026 Erik Rojas\nTitled Queer Life or Compliance to Landmark Forum...

They discuss the transition from the EST training to the two-weekend forum and then to the one-weekend forum. Ed recalled how the focus of the forum shifted from \u2018giving up what you\u0027re putting up with\u2019 to \u2018creating a world of possibility\u2019. Ed also shares his experience and reasons for leaving. The conversation highlights the challenges and controversies surrounding the organization. Ed shares how the Landmark Forum drew inspiration from various sources, namely from Mind Dynamics and Scientology and repackaged ideas to create its own methodology. In fact, the use of the term \u0027technology\u0027 in Landmark, it is suggested, was chosen for its appeal to business and its association with Scientology. They also touch on the influence philosophers, like Heidegger and Maturana, had on the forum\u0027s approach. In conclusion, the evolution of the personal development field and the need for organizations to stay current is emphasized KEY TAKEAWAYS ** The Landmark Forum evolved from the EST training and went through several iterations. ** The focus of the forum shifted from giving up what you\u0027re putting up with to creating a world of possibility. ** The forum incorporated ideas from philosophers like Heidegger and Maturana, emphasizing the power of language and the perception of the world. ** Landmark Forum drew inspiration from various sources and repackaged ideas to create its own methodology. ** Ed Gurowitz, a former forum leader, left Landmark due to a combination of personal reasons and dissatisfaction with the organization\u0027s practices. ** There were controversies and legal issues surrounding Landmark, including lawsuits against former forum leaders. ** The term \u0027technology\u0027 was used in Landmark Forum\u0027s language to appeal to business and may have been influenced by Scientology. ** The conversation highlights the importance of organizations staying current and evolving with the times. ** The evolution of the field and the contextual changes in society impact the effectiveness and relevance of transformational programs.

      "description": "In this conversation, Mark and Anne discuss recent communications from Landmark and debunk the claim that they refuse to respond. They also introduce their guest, Ed Gurowitz, PD.D a psychologist who did the EST training in 1978 and in 1981 went on staff in Werner Erhard\u0027s office, traveling and working directly with Werner. They discuss the history of personal development and the importance of understanding its evolution. Ed shares his experience being one of the EST trainers, being on the \u0022Project to Recreate the Training,\u0022 which resulted in the creation of the Forum. He shares about leading one of the first Forums with Werner! He also worked at Tekniko until he left the network in 1991. The conversation covers various topics related to Werner Erhard and the Forum (becomes the Landmark Forum). Some of the main themes include Werner\u0027s role, a surprise revelation about how he avoids accountability for his own measures, the pressure to enroll people and the emphasis on registrations and money. They also discuss the importance of making a difference, the role of tools in personal development, the relationship between Landmark and the fields of psychiatry and psychology, and the reputation and impact of EST and the Landmark Forum. Key Takeaways ** Recent communications from Landmark have been misleading and false. ** Understanding the history and evolution of personal development is important for the field\u0027s growth and ethical practices. ** Ed Gurowitz shares his experience with the EST training, development of the Forum and Teknico. ** There was ALWAYS pressure to enroll people and focus on registrations and money in the Landmark organization. Werner Erhard had a pattern of avoiding accountability and getting others to do the work. **The desire to make a difference was a driving force for many people involved in the Landmark Forum. ** The Landmark Forum was seen as a tool for personal transformation, with the individual being the source of the difference they wanted to make. ** Werner\u2019s views (per Ed) the fields of psychiatry and psychology, and there was initially respect for these fields within the Landmark community. ** EST and the Landmark Forum had a significant impact on popular culture and were subject to both praise and criticism.",
