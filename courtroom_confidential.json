      "description": "Welcome back to Courtroom Confidential with Joshua Ritter! In this special podcast-only episode, I give a quick rundown of the week\u2019s biggest true crime news, including: - A mistrial declared in the trial of Boston woman Karen Read after a jury could not come to a unanimous decision. - The YSL RICO trial abruptly halted by Judge Ural Glanville until another judge reviews motions from Young Thug and others who want him recused from the case. Plus, the latest in the cases of \u2018Doomsday Cult Mom\u2019 Lori Vallow in Arizona; Maryland mother Rachel Morin\u2019s accused killer; David Swift, a Tennessee man acquitted of murdering his wife now charged with manslaughter; and Sarah Boone, a Florida woman accused of killing her boyfriend by trapping him in a suitcase during a game of Hide and Seek.
