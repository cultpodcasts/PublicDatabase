      "description": "In\u00A0Berkeley Talks\u00A0episode 183, Poulomi Saha, an associate professor in the\u00A0Department of English\u00A0and co-director of the\u00A0Program in Critical Theory at UC Berkeley, discusses how cult culture, once a fringe phenomenon, has moved into the mainstream \u2014 and what that tells us about what we long for, what we fear and who we hope to be.\u0022In this crisis moment, we have a return to desire for overarching meaning, radical acceptance, transformative experience, transcendence,\u0022 says Saha. \u0022But unlike in the 1960s, we\u0027re not dropping out, we\u0027re tuning in ... to a highly regularized representation of cults. If in the 1960s we had the sense that fringe groups and communes might offer us a way out of conformity and regularity, in this current incarnation, when cults appear in our everyday lives, they do so highly regularized.\u0022Saha is currently working on a book about America\u2019s long obsession with its own invented visions of Indian spirituality, and why so often those groups and communities come to be called cults.(Editing note: Because of an audio issue, we left out the Q\u0026A portion of this talk.)Listen to the episode and read a transcript on Berkeley News (news.berkeley.edu).Photo by Jen Siska.Music by Blue Dot Sessions.
