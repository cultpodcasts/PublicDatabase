      "description": "After arrests were made and trials were finished, Jeff Lundgren\u2019s group was destroyed.\r\n\r\nIn total, 13 Kirtland cult members went to prison.\r\n\r\n\u201CAt first, I had a horrible time,\u201D Damon remembered. \u201CI did not do well; I got in fights constantly. We were socially awkward because we were secluded or cut off from the rest of the world. I didn\u2019t have the mental capability yet to live on my own, to be my own person.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until years after their sentencing that Damon and Danny both ended up in the Mansfield Correctional Institution, the facility where 3News investigator Peter Fleischer visited and interviewed both over the course of several months.\r\n\r\nDamon says seeing a familiar face changed the course of his life.\r\n\r\n\u201CI needed somebody who was better than me to force me to be better than myself,\u201D Damon reflected upon being reunited with Kraft. \u201CI grew up, I quit being an idiot, I quit being an inmate and started acting like an adult.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe two say they began sharing a cell in the mid-1990s. According to disciplinary records and several conversations Fleischer had with various prison staff, they\u2019ve found a way to live behind bars.\r\n\r\nThey\u2019re both active in Mansfield\u2019s work programs. They create art and work on music. Copies of the prison\u2019s newspaper confirm some of their proudest stories: helping to build Habitat for Humanity homes and repairing thousands of toys so that families on the outside can enjoy a holiday.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat was something I could be proud of,\u201D Damon smiles as he looks back on the work he\u2019s done behind bars. \u201CIt was the first time in my life I ever had things I could be proud of. It was something that I did that improved the world around me and made life better for other people.\u201D\r\n\r\nRead: https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/investigations/kirtland-cult-killings-jeff-lundgren-damon-danny-kraft-35-years-later-bloodline-blind-faith-mansfield-correctional/95-eb98e320-20cd-4cc5-8b29-8b5e3f7f901b",

They landed in rural West Virginia, a place Jeff felt called to, and a place he claimed God would appear.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe idea was that we would go into the wilderness so that we could remove ourselves from the rest of the world,\u201D explained Kraft. \u201CGod would feel comfortable to come down and live among us.\u201D\r\n\r\nBut even Jeff\u2019s most devout followers struggled with the way they lived. Tents and cold conditions were tough enough, but life with Jeff himself was the biggest challenge.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt was an expression of labor for godliness, and that just takes all the damn fun out of it,\u201D said Damon Lundgren, detailing the group\u2019s way of life in West Virginia and how his father started to wear on others.\r\n\r\nRead more: https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/investigations/kirtland-cult-killings-jeff-lundgren-trials-west-virginia-bloodline-blind-faith-arrest-avery-damon-danny-kraft/95-9e1e3348-402c-4a4f-b3ba-421d1f6133eb",

I had few playmates and I had few friends,\u201D Lundgren once admitted.\r\n\r\nEventually, he realized force brought power.\r\n\r\n\u201CI was very proud of myself the day I was finally big enough,\u201D he recalled of fighting back against his father. \u201CHe [Jeff\u2019s father] said, \u2018I\u2019m going to take you back to that fence,\u2019 and I stood up, looked him in the eye and said, \u2018Let\u2019s go.\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\nJeff left college and served aboard a Navy ship during the Vietnam War. At sea, he studied the Book of Mormon vigorously. When his ship went unscathed during an intense attack, Jeff decided God had spared him.\r\n\r\nBut once discharged and back in Missouri, he struggled, bouncing between jobs and homes.\r\n\r\n\u201CDad screwed up. Dad stole from work. Dad was a bad employee,\u201D Jeff\u0027s oldest son Damon confessed, recounting a childhood that included constant moving and financial challenges.\r\n\r\nBy then a family man, Damon and Jeff\u2019s wife Alice absorbed his rage most often.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe was very aggressive, very dominating. Incredibly strong. He was abusive in a lot of situations,\u201D Damon said. \u201CBut I don\u2019t think that was the key defining thing about him. He was the most devout person I\u2019ve ever seen. The one thing above all was my dad actually did believe the religious teachings that he followed.\u201D\r\n\r\nREAD MORE: https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/investigations/kirtland-cult-jeff-lundgren-killing-bloodline-blind-faith-temple-danny-kraft-avery-damon/95-753fdd61-23ba-47d8-adee-b902c8a7c344\r\n\r\n\r\nAt 3News, we\u2019re here to share the stories that you say matter most to you.
