      "description": "Congressional cosponsors of a law forcing the Justice Department to release its files on Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell can file a lawsuit seeking a court-appointed observer to ensure compliance, but they lack the legal right to append their demand to her criminal case, a judge ruled Wednesday.\n\nJudge Paul A. Engelmayer blocked U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. from intervening in Maxwell\u2019s sex trafficking case. The lawmakers, whose Epstein Files Transparency Act was signed into law by President Donald Trump in November, petitioned the judge last week in a bid to speed the public disclosure of files related to investigations into the late financier and Maxwell, his longtime confidant.",
