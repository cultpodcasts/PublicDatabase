In terms of this course, it\u2019s one of the first steps in Scientology\u2019s process to brainwash and indoctrinate its members. The goal is to make anyone in your life who questions Scientology \u2014 out of love \u2014 seem like an enemy. So many families and friendships have been destroyed thanks to this course.\n\n#Scientology #Cult #SanFrancisco #TomCruise",

Rachael, who is a filmmaker, soon became a favorite of Scientology\u0027s image obsessed and criminal leader David Miscavige. During her time in Scientology, Rachael, due to her position, was witness to a great deal. In her first interview with Mike and Me, Rachael talks about the two things that led her to leave: she is gay (which in Scientology is one of the worst things you can be) and she was tired of witnessing Scientology cover up crimes against minors. \n\nRachael finally escaped Scientology in 2020 and went straight to the FBI to tell them what she had witnessed. \n-------------------------------------------------\nRead My Memoir About My Life In Scientology: https://amzn.to/3sYRXdX",

And big thanks and hugs to all the ex-JW\u2019s that were on the A\u0026E Special, and for openly sharing their experiences and stories. \n\nIn this video, I share my thoughts about the show, triggers, and other stuff that came up. Regardless of how long you\u2019ve been out of the JW Organization, (ExJW; DF\u2019d; or just have JW family), there will be things from this Special that will stir up emotions, on various levels. \nBe mindful of this, and take care of yourselves. x\n\nFor people that are considering joining, leaving, or studying with Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, please watch the A\u0026E program. It is an honest look at real-life experiences of what happens in this Organization. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nIf you missed the A\u0026E special that aired last night, (Nov 13/18), \u0022Leah Remini - The Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses\u0022... and don\u0027t have access to A\u0026E, or have a cable service provider that let\u2019s you stream it, here\u0027s a workaround I found\u2026\n\nDownload the A\u0026E app on your phone. \nSign up with a new account, and you\u2019ll get 3 credits to watch 3 programs, one of which you can choose this Special. \nHope that works for any of you that are looking for it! \n:)  \n\nUPDATE: Here\u0027s a link that was shared with me for those that are able to view it... https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6x5upe\n-------------------\n\nAbout sharing stories and experiences - \n\nI love this quote by Iyanla Vanzant: \n\u0022It\u0027s important that we share our experiences with others. Your story will heal you and your story will heal somebody else. When you tell your story, you free yourself and give other people permission to acknowledge their own story.\u0022 \n\n--------------------\n\nPLEASE NOTE: If you are only here to troll, preach, or be disrepectful, your comments will be deleted. \n\nThis channel is meant to be a positive, respectful and welcoming space/community for people that are going through similar experiences from their association of the JW.Org . Especially those of you that have been disfellowshipped or shunned from your friends and family, know that you aren\u0027t alone. Thanks for being here.  :)",
