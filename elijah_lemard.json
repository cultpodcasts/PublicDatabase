      "description": "I really spent the last year of my life exploring one of the strangest, most mysterious movements on Earth. Why? Honestly\u2026 I have no idea anymore. I thought this channel was about my love of scams, but maybe I just love doing these insane things. \n\nI went undercover to explore a movement that some call a cult, others call a path to enlightenment, and some treat as their main source of news. What I found? A mess of park meditations, enigmatic leadership, media power plays, karma, aliens and more questions than answers.\n\nThis is an untold story: part investigation, part interview and part deep dive into a world of mind control tactics, alien visions, and unexpected links between dance shows, media empires, and global politics.\n\nNow that the SEO stuff is out of the way, man this was wild. Like WILD. Thank you for clicking on this video, and thank you for watching! Let me know if you want to see more like this in the future and what your thoughts are on this whole mess in the comments.\n\nALSO yo, my bad Drake. I know this has nothing to do with you, but I cant get over it, like why would you say that? Shout out Kenrick. \nAlso LEBRON!!!!!!!\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/ElijahLemard\n\nOkay, here are the time stamps:\n0:00 \u2013 Intro And Big Picture\n1:23 \u2013 Japan!
