      "description": "These podcasts are for survivors of trauma of corrosive control\u2014high control groups such as Cult, Churches, down to one-on-one abusive relationships. I am Susan Dones, \u00A0a whistleblower of a Cult known as NXIVM, taken down by the DOJ. Its leader Keith Raniere is doing 120 years in prison. Am I an expert? No, but I know more than your average Joe off the street about these things.\u00A0 These are stories of those who survived those same traumas, the tools that got them through, and the battles they fought. Join us on our journeys from hell to a new life. Today I am answering questions sent to me by people visiting my website SusanDones.com Most of them have been following the NXIVM story on HBO The Vow or other media outlets",
