      "description": "Hi! Comment and share your story as well. \n\nThis is my journey explaining how the community (although good intent) in Alcoholics Anonymous is based off 3 concepts: fear mongering, victim consciousness, and shame consciousness. \n\nHow these 3 ideologies kept me in a long 10 year cycle of relapse \u0026 recover. \n\nFinally once I left, I was able to gather my own understanding of what my patterns consisted of and how I can take my power back by unraveling the teachings I carried from this cult like community. \n\n\n#alcoholicsanonymous #cult #selfimprovement #spirituality #sobriety #sobrietylife #trauma #empowerment #storytime",
