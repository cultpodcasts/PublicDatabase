This channel has allowed me to heal from what I dealt with, and I know it can help you too. Let\u2019s share YOUR story. I\u2019m tired of people commenting on here saying \u201Cit\u2019s not true\u201D or \u201Cyou\u2019re lying\u201D. For those of you who have been victims of this group, it\u2019s time YOUR voice is heard and not hidden anymore. We can either do a podcast style interview (we can block out your face and change your voice), or I can read out loud an email you send an keep your name anonymous. I want your story to be heard. \uD83E\uDDE1\nEmail: Stnding4theTruth@Gmail.Com\n\u203C\uFE0FDISCLAIMER\u203C\uFE0F I take your privacy VERY seriously.
