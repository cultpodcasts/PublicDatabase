      "title": "The TOTALITARIANISM of Stalin, Hitler and... Trump? With Prof. Marci Shore",
      "description": "Marci Shore is a historian, chair in European Intellectual history, a professor at the Munk School of Global affairs, and the author of The Taste of Ashes: The Afterlife of Totalitarianism in Eastern Europe. Since she\u0027s an expert in the history of totalitarian regimes, I ask her about Hitler\u0027s Nazi Germany, the brutal claustrophobia of Stalinism, the twisted psychology of Soviet purges and the totalitarian mechanisms that turned ordinary people into monsters. As prof. Shore recently made headlines when she announced she is leaving the US due to Donald Trump and his policies, we can\u0027t get past the question on how close current America is to a totalitarian state and even to civil war. Tovarishi and tovarischitze, you don\u0027t wanna miss this one!",
