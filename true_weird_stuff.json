      "description": "Today\u0027s True Weird Stuff - Nazi Farm Part 1 Paul Sch\u00E4fer was a Nazi who, after World War II, would go on to become a minister. When Sch\u00E4fer was accused of abusing two young boys at his orphanage, he fled to Chile and started a community called Colonia Dignidad. Though this 53-square-mile compound looked peaceful on the outside, Colonia Dignidad was a horrific nightmare. Violence, abuse, forced separation of families, and an alliance with a Chilean dictator were just a few of the ways Paul Sch\u00E4fer maintained control over his Nazi cult with an iron fist.",

      "title": "August Engelhardt\u0027s Coconut Cult",
      "description": "In the early 1900s, a German author named August Engelhardt packed up his library of books, moved to the South Pacific island of Kabakon, and started a sun-worshipping coconut cult. He believed the way to become closer to God and gain immortality was by consuming coconuts and nothing else. Engelhardt convinced dozens of people to join him on the island, but many of them died from illness or malnutrition. And the ones who didn\u0027t perish fled, having realized the lunacy of a man who was cuckoo for coconuts.\n\n\nhttps://trueweirdstuff.com/",
