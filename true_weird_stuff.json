      "description": "Today\u0027s True Weird Stuff - Nazi Farm Part 1 Paul Sch\u00E4fer was a Nazi who, after World War II, would go on to become a minister. When Sch\u00E4fer was accused of abusing two young boys at his orphanage, he fled to Chile and started a community called Colonia Dignidad. Though this 53-square-mile compound looked peaceful on the outside, Colonia Dignidad was a horrific nightmare. Violence, abuse, forced separation of families, and an alliance with a Chilean dictator were just a few of the ways Paul Sch\u00E4fer maintained control over his Nazi cult with an iron fist.",

      "description": "In the previous episode of True Weird Stuff, we told the story of Ra\u00EBlism, the religious UFO cult led by Claude Vorilhon. We\u0027re now diving into one of their core beliefs: that Jesus was resurrected through cloning and humans need to perfect human cloning to achieve immortality. That would lead to a claim made in 2002 by a scientific company created by Ra\u00EBlians that the first human clone had been born. \n\n| Ep. 96 | True Weird Stuff\nhttps://trueweirdstuff.com/",

      "description": "This is the story of a man who created a religion around UFO\u0027s. Claude Vorilhon was a journalist who claimed he was abducted by aliens in 1973. He said they told him humans were created by extraterrestrial species using advanced technology, and then they renamed him Ra\u00EBl and sent him back to Earth to serve as ambassador to their faith. And thus, Ra\u00EBlism was born.\n\n| Ep. 95 | True Weird Stuff\nhttps://trueweirdstuff.com/",

      "description": "In the early 1900s, a German author named August Engelhardt packed up his library of books, moved to the South Pacific island of Kabakon, and started a sun-worshipping coconut cult. He believed the way to become closer to God and gain immortality was by consuming coconuts and nothing else. Engelhardt convinced dozens of people to join him on the island, but many of them died from illness or malnutrition. And the ones who didn\u0027t perish fled, having realized the lunacy of a man who was cuckoo for coconuts.\n\n\nhttps://trueweirdstuff.com/",

He invented solid rocket fuel, co-founded the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and he was also an occultist. He was written out of a lot of NASA\u0027s history because of his antics: he was the leader of a black-magic sex mansion, ate menstrual cakes, and was frenemies with L. Ron Hubbard. Jack Parsons was the definition of a mad scientist.\n\n| Ep. 67 | True Weird Stuff\nhttps://trueweirdstuff.com/",
