      "description": "Webster Edgerly was the creator of a social movement known as Ralstonism. His self-promoted pseudoscience was based upon his advocacy of racial eugenics and strict health and hygiene habits. That\u0027s why in 1902, Edgerly\u0027s Ralstonism movement would end up partnering with popular food brand Purina, whose whole-grain cereal Edgerly considered to be the perfect food for his faithful followers.\n\n| Ep. 122 | True Weird Stuff\nhttps://trueweirdstuff.com/",

When Sch\u00E4fer was accused of abusing two young boys at his orphanage, he fled to Chile and started a community called Colonia Dignidad. Though this 53-square-mile compound looked peaceful on the outside, Colonia Dignidad was a horrific nightmare. Violence, abuse, forced separation of families, and an alliance with a Chilean dictator were just a few of the ways Paul Sch\u00E4fer maintained control over his Nazi cult with an iron fist.",

We\u0027re now diving into one of their core beliefs: that Jesus was resurrected through cloning and humans need to perfect human cloning to achieve immortality. That would lead to a claim made in 2002 by a scientific company created by Ra\u00EBlians that the first human clone had been born. \n\n| Ep. 96 | True Weird Stuff\nhttps://trueweirdstuff.com/",

He said they told him humans were created by extraterrestrial species using advanced technology, and then they renamed him Ra\u00EBl and sent him back to Earth to serve as ambassador to their faith.

He believed the way to become closer to God and gain immortality was by consuming coconuts and nothing else. Engelhardt convinced dozens of people to join him on the island, but many of them died from illness or malnutrition. And the ones who didn\u0027t perish fled, having realized the lunacy of a man who was cuckoo for coconuts.\n\n\nhttps://trueweirdstuff.com/",

He was written out of a lot of NASA\u0027s history because of his antics: he was the leader of a black-magic sex mansion, ate menstrual cakes, and was frenemies with L. Ron Hubbard.
