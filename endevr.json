It would be 10 years before he was able to escape.\n\nUsing a technique called \u2018love-bombing\u2019 cults prey on the vulnerable, recruiting new members with love and warmth. After a period of brain-washing, members are forbidden to leave, enslaved through psychological control, and in Samuel\u2019s case, even violence. He was finally able to escape in the dead of night, persued by other members and seek help.\n\nCult Witness is an intelligent exploration of how cults attract and manipulate their followers, sharing the disturbing firsthand experiences of Cult Witness director Samuel Stefan and six others who have freed themselves from cults: Jill Mytton (The Exclusive Brethren), Jim Bergin and Judy Garvey (The Gentle Wind Project), Lea Saskia Laasner (The Janus Project), and Celeste Jones and Amoreena Winkler (The Children of God).\n\nAnalytical insights into the cult experience are provided by leadership expert Betty Sue Flowers; Benjamin Zablocki, chair of the Department of Sociology at Rutgers University; UCLA Professor Emeritus Bertram Raven, an expert on interpersonal influence and social power relationships; psychotherapist Miguel Perlado, who specializes in cult-related problems; and Urs Eschmann, a specialist in legal issues involving cults.\n\nCult Witness unravels the hidden world of cults; the hold they have on their victims, the reasons people form and fall prey to them and what takes place within..\n\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\nSubscribe ENDEVR for free: https://bit.ly/3e9YRRG\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/endevrdocs/\n\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\n#FreeDocumentary #ENDEVR #cults\n\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\nENDEVR explains the world we live in through high-class documentaries, special investigations, explainers videos and animations.

Manny Waks demands the perpetrators be brought to justice, as well as the rabbis, whom he claims covered it up.\n\nHis father Zephaniah joins forces with his son, but soon finds he has been virtually excommunicated for breaking an ancient Jewish law forbidding Jews from informing secular authorities about other Jews.\n\nWe see how father and son split this tightly-knit, powerful Jewish community as we open the door into their insular world of study and duty, charity and faith, power and piety.\n\nWill Manny get justice in court? Will the rabbis be held to account?

Nearly all Mennonites live in self-sufficient colonies, embracing isolation, which helps protect them from the temptations of the modern world. Now, for the first time, one of these communities has agreed to open their doors to our cameras.\nAt first sight, time seems to have stopped in the colony of Little Belize, in South America. People travel around on horse-drawn carriages and still speak Plattdeutsch, an old German dialect. But even here, signs of the outside world are creeping in. Wilhelm, the community\u2019s former doctor, was recently expelled for owning a mobile phone. Fearing their community is being tainted, some traditional members, like Abram and his family, have decided to create a new colony, even more isolated, in the jungle of Peru, where they can remain true to their original doctrine.\nWe follow them on their exodus and take an unprecedented look at the world of the Mennonites.\n\n\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\n\nSubscribe ENDEVR for free: https://bit.ly/3e9YRRG\nJoin the club and become a Patron: https://www.patreon.com/freedocumentary\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/endevrdocs/\n\n\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\n#FreeDocumentary #ENDEVR #Mennonites\n\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\n\nENDEVR explains the world we live in through high-class documentaries, special investigations, explainers videos and animations.
