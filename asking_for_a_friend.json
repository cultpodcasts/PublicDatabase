In this episode we discuss the shocking \u0027clarification of understanding\u0027 that now allows Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses to get an education beyond basic compulsory schooling. After decades of young JWs having to scratch a living with bare minimum jobs that do not require any additional education, suddenly the Governing Body has discovered that Galatians 6:5 means people can go to college and university.We discuss the implications, reasons and ruined lives.

We discuss his simmering anger and the things he banned, the four women he summoned with a whistle, his relationship with his personal assistant Berta, his wealth and alcoholism that led him to move away from Bethel to his vanity project Beth Sarim. We also learn about his hatred of the Jews and his love of Hitler which turned sour and led to the death of over 1000 faithful Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses. We also manage to fit in some discussion of his hatred of beards, women, Mother\u0027s Day and prohibition.

Louise, Adam and Stephanie each take one change to the doctrine or practice of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses and discuss what the real reasons behind the changes might have been. The sound is not great, but the subject matter is fascinating. Adam looks at why the elders arrangement has been changed recently to allow men as young as 21 to become elders in congregations of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses. Stephanie discusses why the book study meeting held in peoples home was removed and the team speculate as to the reasons behind the change. Louise discusses the court case that preceded the literature changing from having a fixed price printed on the covers, to being offered to householders for \u0027free\u0027, albeit it with strong encouragement to make a donation.

Adam has a little gem of information from the latest letter to congregations, that might have a huge implication for a future discussion around child labour, Child Labour laws and modern slavery as defined by the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
