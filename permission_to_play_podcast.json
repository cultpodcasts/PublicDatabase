      "description": "I have a question for you. Here\u2019s the situation: You\u2019re an ambitious, twenty-three year-old performing arts school grad. Trained by the best and bursting with dreams, you\u2019re poised for greatness. Gonna take Hollywood and take her all the way. What would you do next? It\u2019s obvious, right? You\u2019d join a cult. Wouldn\u2019t you? This episode features an interview with me by Allison Santana, host of Memoir Lane podcast. We discuss my memoir, Born Again, Again: That time I fell down a rabbit hole and spent twenty-two years as a Bible thumping, tongue speaking, Gospel preaching Born Again Christian. And then I woke up. We explore my decades-long deep dive into the Charismatic Christian church, the impact it had on me and my family, and how we eventually made our way out. The conversation explores the subtle manipulations that some religious institutions employ, the importance of questioning and challenging control masked as righteousness, and the powerful role that love and genuine connection should play in our relationships and community. My chat with Allison further underscores the relevance of self-actualization, being in tune with oneself, and listening to the innate wisdom within. Born Again, Again was a finalist for both the 2021 Next Generation Indie Book Awards and the 15th Annual National Indie Excellence Awards. *** Listen to Allison\u0027s podcast, Memoir Lane, on Apple , Spotify , or any of your favorite podcast platforms.
