      "description": "Facilitated Communication is marketed as a miraculous tool for non-speaking autistic children. But what happens when this controversial method leads to devastating consequences? In this episode, we hear from Kevin Plantin, a father who was falsely accused of assault based solely on messages typed with the help of a facilitator. Despite the evidence, some courts and institutions still give FC credibility\u2014with tragic consequences. In this episode, Kevin Plantin recounts how a letter typed via FC led to his wrongful imprisonment for 10 months on charges of sexual assault. We also revisit the story of Janyce Boynton, a former FC facilitator who now warns against the practice after witnessing its harmful effects firsthand.

First, there\u0027s a startup phase where an entrepreneurial cult leader leads a movement and brings new innovative and revolutionary ideas. Take, for example, Jim Jones , leader of the People\u0027s Temple. In the beginning, he integrated his congregation during the Civil Rights Movement. After that, he was heavily involved in politics and social activism. The allure was undeniable. But in the end, Jones ordered 909 commune members to end their lives.

      "description": "If you haven\u0027t listened to The Prophet series, start here: http://pretendradio.org/the-prophet-word-of-faith-fellowship-revisited/ When I first started this podcast, I reported on a secretive church located in the foothills in western North Carolina called the Word of Faith Fellowship. The church is accused of being a cult and separating families\u2014forcing them to break ties with non-believers. One teenager named Matthew Fenner pressed charges against five church ministers because he said they beat the gay demons out of him. And that\u0027s just the beginning. Several former members reported being forced into isolation in what is known as the lower building. Some male congregants say they lived in this makeshift storage unit for over a year. But perhaps they\u0027re best remembered for their signature style of prayer. It\u0027s known as blasting. As you can hear in this secret audio recording, blasting is a form of deliverance meant to cast out the devil. It has been said that crying babies were often held down and yelled at until the devil released its grip on the child. I\u0027ve experienced blasting first hand. In 2018, I was personally invited by the church\u0027s leader, Jane Whaley, to spend the day at the Word of Faith Fellowship. While interviewing her in her office, Jane Whaley looked me straight in the eyes, opened her mouth, and began shouting. It was terrifying. To this day, I still get chills. It\u0027s been 2 years since I finished my 11-part series on the Word of Faith. Since then, I\u0027ve been flooded with emails asking me to give them an update. They want to know, have there been any new allegations of abuse? Have any of the church leaders faced any criminal charges? Is Jane Whaley still running the church? Today, I plan to answer some of these questions. ______ Story idea? If you have a story to share, email Javier at javier@pretendradio.org. For more episodes like this, visit pretendradio.org.

      "description": "Let\u2019s say a man speaks to another man. Perhaps he looks at him for too long or laughs at his joke. That\u2019s gay. Maybe you\u2019re standing too close. It doesn\u2019t matter. If I\u2019m a Word of Faith fellowship member and I think you\u2019re gay\u2014then you\u2019re gay. I don\u2019t have to prove it\u2013I know it. And I can\u2019t let you suffer from those gay demons. I have to pray for you to release the gay spirits out of you. And the way we pray at the Word of Faith Fellowship is through loud prayers. And it\u2019s not only me praying over you\u2014Sussie, Bobby, and Roger will join in. Soon, you\u2019ll have 20 to 30 people screaming at you. And like Jane says, \u201Cpeople can get carried away.\u201D So, it\u2019s easy to imagine this prayer becoming more than a loud scream. I might hold on to your shoulders and give you a gentle tug. Then, I might punch you in the chest. Maybe my hands creep further up, and before I realize it, I\u2019m wrapping my fingers around your neck. This hypothetical scenario I painted for you is exactly what Matthew Fenner says happened to him. Release the gay demons Tonight, it\u2019s Matthew Fenner\u2019s turn to receive an exorcism. Church ministers are praying over him. They\u2019re trying to release the devil\u2019s grip over his homosexual desires. Danielle Cordes was there the night. She says Brooke Covington, Jane\u2019s so-called adopted daughter, was the one calling the shots. People who know Brooke\u2019s style of worship say that she doesn\u2019t have time to deal with your devils. So when it\u2019s time to pray over you, it\u2019s going to hurt. Brooke barks at Danielle and demands her to join in. \u201CBrooke was the one coaching them through it,\u201D explained Danielle. She says she too participated in the prayer. \u201CI never slapped him or did any of that. I had my arm on him, but if I had like, I don\u2019t know, I couldn\u2019t do it. I just couldn\u2019t do it.\u201D The case against Brooke Covington and the Word of Faith Fellowship The night after the alleged attack, Matthew Fenner escaped the Word of Faith Fellowship. He went straight to the police and filed a report. Unfortunately for him, the authorities were only willing to file misdemeanor charges. It will take years for actual criminal charges to be filed. To give you an idea, this beating allegedly took place in January 2013. Matthew was 19 at the time. He\u2019s 25 years old now. That\u2019s almost 5 years and there\u2019s still no resolution to this case. What happens next? This is the final installment of season 3 The Prophet.

      "description": "Jane Whaley recently turned 80-years-old. Obviously, the Word of Faith Fellowship can\u2019t go on forever. At least not the way we know of it today. So, who\u2019s taking over? Can it go on without Jane Whaley\u2019s vision and authority? Or will it all just fall apart? John Huddle, a former member, says that Jane\u2019s biological daughter Robin Webster is believed to take over the church. But he suspects that, when Jane Whaley dies, there will be a power struggle within the church.The case against the Word of Faith Fellowship We\u2019ll talk more about this alleged attack in the next episode. Today, we\u2019re going to focus on how we got to this point. Before Brooke Covington was charged with kidnapping and beating Matthew Fenner, she was actually the person who recruited him into the church. How did she go from being his spiritual leader, to being charged with beating him? In order to understand the case against Brooke Covington and the Word of Faith Fellowship ministries, you first understand how Matthew Fenner joined the church. Cults recruit the vulnerable The biggest questions I get all the time is, how do people get sucked into a cult. Everyone says that they would never fall for it, so how did Matthew and his family become one of them? Before Matthew Fenner joined the Word of Faith Fellowship, he thought they were freaks. He heard rumors of the demonic possessions and members vomiting in buckets to evil spirits. Let\u2019s just say that he wasn\u2019t exactly a perfect candidate. And on top of that, Matthew was openly gay and considered himself an atheist. So, how does someone like him get sucked into a ultra conservative Christian cult? The Word of Faith Fellowship found Matthew Fenner, and his family, when there were at their lowest point. Matthew\u2019s family rejected his sexuality, his mother was in a bad marriage, and they were running out of money. These were desperate times. Matthew attended his first service in February 2010. During this time he had friends, was a member of a dance troupe, and attended public school. By December of that same year, he cut ties with everyone he knew, quit dance, and enrolled in the church\u2019s private school. How did it happen? How can someone go from gay atheist to a god-fearing cult member? Matthew Fenner describes his journey into the Word of Faith Fellowship.

      "description": "Christina Bryant is about to go face-to-face with the real Jane Whaley. In my previous episode, I got to see the political side of Jane\u2014the Jane she wanted the world to meet. Christina, on the other hand, is about to talk with the real Jane Whaley\u2014the one everyone fears. And she got it all on tape. Christina Bryant went undercover inside the Word of Faith Fellowship. She\u2019s wearing a hidden microphone. It\u2019s been 6 years since she last step foot in the church. You see, Christina is a former member who has been excommunicated and is forbidden to contact her family. If she ever wants to ever speak with them again, she has to go through Jane Whaley first. This 3-hour recording is completely engrossing. However, there are certain parts of this tape that brings up interesting legal questions regarding child abuse. Jane flat out says she\u2019s not required by law to report sexual abuse because of pastor confidentiality. Is this true? How can this be true? Jane also claims if a child has bruising, the NC Department of Social Services doesn\u2019t consider that abuse. Reporting Child Abuse and Neglect in North Carolina I reached out to my friend Rabia Chaudry from the Undisclosed Podcast for help. She put me in touch with her co-host Colin Miller , to walk me through what Jane says and how it applies to North Carolina law. I have to say, I\u2019m shocked. I also spoke with NC licensed attorney Paul Ditz . He\u2019s one of the few attorney\u2019s to have ever questioned Jane Whaley on the stand. He tells me that just because DSS allows minor bruising and Jane is protected by penitent privilege, doesn\u2019t mean that she\u2019s not responsible. Take a deep breath because you\u2019re about to go inside the mind of Jane Whaley.

      "description": "The world first learned about the Word of Faith Fellowship after an Inside Edition expos\u00E9 in 1995. The investigation, led by the Trinity Foundation, revealed accusations of abuse within the church. Watch the Inside Edition story: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwE5fBT9RYE Jane Whaley\u0027s quiet little kingdom was suddenly in the spotlight. Hidden cameras captured Jane\u0027s signature screaming prayer. Church members told Inside Edition that they would strap children to chairs so they wouldn\u0027t run away. It was horrifying. After a brief press conference, Jane Whaley never spoke to the media on the record ever again. So why did she pick me as her first interview since 1995? I asked Jane, \u0022Why me?\u0022 She told me that God spoke to her after listening to my show. But why now? Jane says she wanted to contact me but said that she didn\u2019t know how to reach me. During my visit, Sam Whaley told me that the closest they\u2019ve come to talking to the media was when a BBC producer approached her about doing a story. She said he was very nice, just like me. But in the end, they decided it wasn\u2019t right. Then, an A\u0026E documentary crew asked to interview Jane and bring cameras into the church. Jane flat out said no because they weren\u2019t interested in the truth. Her lawyers told me that the TV crew and former members showed up unannounced to church member owned businesses and caused a spectacle. My interview with cult leader Jane Whaley of the Word of Faith Fellowship After the 3-hour service was over, Jane and I walked back to her office. Jane Whaley sat next to me. To my left sat her husband Sam Whaley. And across the room sat her two attorneys Mark Norris and Josh Farmer. Without ever even asking a question, Jane began to tell me about every controversial issue facing the church. She told me that she knows nothing about unemployment (Jane\u0027s referring to the recent the guilty pleas in the unemployment fraud cases .) When I asked her about the Brazilian slaves, she told me that some of the Brazilian\u0027s making these claims are entitled and lazy. During the meeting, Jane performed a blasting prayer for me. She also told me that she\u0027s gearing for a great confrontation and that they\u0027re ready for the end of times. National Domestic Violence Hotline I also want to take the time to thank the former members who have listened to the show and have written me emails, facebook messages about their experience at the Word of Faith Fellowship. It just reinforces that what I\u2019m doing is important. Also, I know there are current members reading this right now. If you feel you\u2019re in danger or just need someone to talk to, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline 1-800-799-7233. They\u2019re available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. They can help you find a place to stay near Spindale while you figure things out.

      "description": "Previously on Pretend Radio, I came face-to-face with pastor Jane Whaley of the Word of Faith Fellowship. When I arrived, we met in her office for a few minutes before the church service began. I was surprised by everyone\u0027s friendliness. Suddenly, the music started playing and we knew it was time to head into the main sanctuary. Jane Whaley held my hand as we walked down a long hallway towards the service. As we inched closer to the sanctuary, the music got louder and louder\u2014it was ear drum busting loud. Jane and I walked in like rock stars. Her attorney escorted me to the second row behind Jane and her husband Sam Whaley. Word of Faith Fellowship sanctuary in Spindale, North Carolina Was the church service real or just a big show? The service started around 9:30am and ended around 12:30pm. It was a musical event filled with praise and worship. Old women were jumping up and down in their high heels, old men were singing as loud as they could, and the children appeared to be happy. Former members say that this is exactly what Jane Whaley wanted me to see. According to them, this service was tailored specifically for me. Bonus episode: Why did Paul McCartney\u0027s drummer join a cult? Joe English played drums with Paul McCartney and Wings. Today, he\u0027s a devoted member at the Word of Faith Fellowship church in Spindale, North Carolina. I met Joe English during my visit.

      "description": "As far as I know, I\u0027m the first journalist who has ever interviewed pastor Jane Whaley. Heck, I might be the only member of the media to have attended church service. How was I able to pull this off? The short answer is, I have no idea. In fact, when the executive producer of the upcoming A\u0026E series on Word of Faith Fellowship found out about my exclusive interview, he gave me a call. He asked me, \u0022I just want to know one thing... how did you do it?\u0022 I told him, \u0022I just asked nicely?\u0022 (UPDATE: A\u0026E pulls the docu-series the night before it was scheduled to air ) My first contact with Jane Whaley The last people to get an invitation to the Word of Faith Fellowship got the cops called on them. However, that didn\u0027t stop me from contacting Jane. I have Jane Whaley\u0027s email address and intend to use it. Besides, what\u0027s the worst thing that could happen?

      "description": "Did you know that the Word of Faith Fellowship has nearly 2,000 members internationally? They have affiliate churches all over the world including Brazil, Sweden, Scotland, and other countries. Brazil is by far the biggest territory ruled under Jane Whaley\u2019s kingdom. They have churches in two southeastern Brazilian cities. The first church is in Soa Joaquim de Bicas which is about 6 hours north of Rio de Janeiro. They also have second church in Franco de Rocha which is an hour outside of Sao Paulo. Jane conquers Brazil and offers them salvation For a few lucky Brazilians, Jane blessed them with more than just salvation\u2014an opportunity to live in the United States. Ana Albuquerque told the Associated Press that when she first arrived in Spindale, church members showered her with love. She said, \u0022The first time you go, they treat you well. But afterwards, they start treating you bad.\u201D Ana says things turned ugly fast. She claims she worked full time as a teacher\u2019s assistant and baby sat church member\u2019s children at night\u2013all without pay. Then the physical abuse started. Ana says that Jane and another minister spanked her with a wooden stick. She told the AP they blasted her with a screaming prayer because she was \u201Cunclean\u201D and possessed by the devil. And we\u2019re not talking a small tap on the butt kind of spank. Ana says the beatings lasted for at least 40 minutes. She finally was allowed to return to Brazil and has since left the church. 16 Brazilians come forward \u201CIt was a horror living there,\u201D says Rebecca Mello. Her dreams of freedom quickly turned into a nightmare. She told the Associated Press that she was brought to the US in 2009 on a student visa. Immediately after she got here, church leaders took her passports and her money, and was quickly put to work. \u0022We\u2019re made to get up early, make the kids breakfast, cook, do their beds, pick up the the laundry.\u201D Thiago Silva says, \u0022We were there working, but we never got paid. If you\u2019re not paid for something, even for your food, I would say that you\u2019re a slave.\u0022 All in all, 16 Brazilian\u2019s have come forward to share their personal story of abuse and enslavement.

A guardian ad litem is someone who represents kids in the foster care system. It\u2019s her job to place children in homes with the right parents. If she doesn\u2019t get right, her decision can cause lasting damage on these vulnerable children. This was a challenge Nancy was willing to take. So, put yourself in Nancy\u2019s shoes for a second.

This episode explores the series of questions surrounding the Word of Faith and accusations about their grip on local government. For example, did you know the Jane Whaley\u2019s son in law, Frank Webster, was an assistant state prosecutor at a nearby county ? There are also accusations that a local social workers undermined abuse investigations at the Word of Faith Fellowship? The list of accusations go on and on.

      "description": "On April 7th, 2018, more than a dozen former Word of Faith Fellowship members reunited at the Spindale House in Rutherford County, North Carolina. It was an opportunity for former members to answer lingering questions for the citizens in the community. But in reality, it was probably an event designed to make good television for the documentary crew filming the whole thing. When I walked into the room, I expected a small gathering with a few chairs. Instead, I counted 6 professional video cameras and crew to match it. It was a huge production. I soon learned that today\u2019s community event was part of an upcoming A\u0026E documentary series on the Word of Faith Fellowship. Each former member in the panel sat behind a microphone provided by the A\u0026E crew. About 80 to 100 people were in attendance\u2014including current members of the Word of Faith Fellowship. The room was tense. John Cooper, former Word of Faith Fellowship Former Members speaks about his experience with the Department of Social Services in Rutherford, County. Survivors speak out against Pastor Jane Whaley This episode was especially hard to write because there were so many stories to tell. But there was one story that stood out more than the others. Former Word of Faith Fellowship member Jamey Anderson delivered an impassioned speech about leaving the church. He lamented about being cut off from his family and missing his own grandfather\u2019s funeral. In the audience sat his mother with an emotionless expression on her face. You see, Jamey\u2019s mother is still a member at the church and has cut all communication with her son. Jamey called her out and said, \u201CI\u2019m very happy to see that whatever I\u0027ve done has motivated her to show up today. So it\u0027s at least good to see her.\u201D Jamey used his time behind the microphone to respond to his mother\u2019s 30 minute YouTube video. In the video, his mother Patti, his grandmother Dot, and his step-sister Allison describe why they think Jamey\u2019s a liar and justify why they have disowned him. ---SUBSCRIBE--- Apple Podcasts Google Play Stitcher Spotify ---PROMO--- Let\u0027s Talk About Sects Killafornia Dreaming ---MUSIC--- Thechicken.net Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "Season 3: The Prophet - Word of Faith Fellowship Revisited I\u2019m back with a whole new season of Pretend Radio. But this time it\u2019s going to be a little different. Instead of telling you a different story each episode, I decided to do a serialize season where I tell you a single story, one episode at a time. So what is it about? It\u2019s about the first episode I aired on this show\u2014the Word of Faith Fellowship church. Back in season one, I met up with a man who says he escaped the cult. His name is John Cooper. I contacted him and asked \u0022Hey, do you want to meet up? I\u2019m thinking about starting a podcast and would like to tell your story.\u0022 So, we just met up at a park in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. At this point, I didn\u2019t know what this podcast was all about. All I knew was that he was part of a religious sect. And what he told me that day in that park blew my mind. But in the end, I feel like I didn\u2019t do that story justice. It was one guy\u2019s story. I needed to go out to the other side of the state, where the Word of Faith Fellowship is located, and do a little more digging. So, I got in my car and drove west. After I spending the whole day in Spindale, North Carolina, I thought to myself, there is no way I keep everything I just learned in one episode. If season one was about John cooper, season 3 is all about the town of Spindale. The episode you\u2019re about to listen to is my first 3 episodes rolled into one. And I\u2019m going to stitch them together by playing some ads for some non-profits organizations. And at the end of the episode there\u2019s a preview of the new season. Now many of you have already heard this story, but trust me, even I had to go back and listen to these episodes. Once the season starts, I\u2019m not going to spend a lot setting things up. We\u2019re just going to get right to it. If you\u2019re new to Pretend Radio, well this is a great place to start. Let me tell you, it\u2019s pretty crazy. I got deeper into this story than any other journalist. The BBC has tried and failed. The Associated Press tried and they couldn\u2019t get in. Even A\u0026E is producing a documentary on the WOFF and they didn\u2019t get the access I got. So enjoy this flashback episode and revisit The Prophet from season one. And get ready for the season because it\u2019s coming out very soon. Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
