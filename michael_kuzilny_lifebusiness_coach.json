      "description": "Simon H in this episode describes growing up and being a long time church member of a bizarre and controlling Geelong based  religious cult.\n\nSimon says the church leaders of the Geelong Revival centre were very controlling, split up families , and believed all psychologists are devils !\n\nThis is certainly not just another ordinary church.\n\nHe says as a Child he was not permitted to make friends outside this religious cult, and as a result fell into a life of deep depression.\n\nIt finally took him 35 years to see the light.   There are other articles on Google from ex cult members, but church leaders say these people left because they had a troubled relationship with god.\n\nSimon is now happily  married, they have a beautiful daughter and he has started Creating his own rules for life.\n\nAnd the Geelong Revival centre is apparently still going strong.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nCheck out more of my content below:\n\u25BA Foxtel Aurora TV Channel 173 - Fri 9PM\n\u25BA Channel 31 Melbourne and Geelong - Wed 8PM\n\u25BA Channel 44 Adelaide - Fri 9.30PM\n\u25BA Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/themichaelkuzilnyshow\n\u25BA Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/themichaelkuzilnyshow/\n\n#toughtimes #motivation #inspiration",
