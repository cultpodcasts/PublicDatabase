      "description": "Send us a text\nIn this episode, I am joined with The Vanessa Reiser, survivor, therapist, mom, author, ironman, and narcissistic/cult expert. We delve into how victims can escape, become survivors and then learn to thrive despite what their exes do or don\u0027t do. Vanessa talks about her own personal story and how she climbed out from the bottom she found herself in and rebuilt her life from the ground up. She partners her own personal experience with her professional expertise on narcissistic abuse to provide us with tips, tricks, tools, and strategies for all those who find themselves in abusive relationships, and those who have escaped them.\u00A0\n\n\nIf you\u0027ve ever wondered how to build back up, how to heal, how to thrive and not merely survive, this conversation is for you.\u00A0\nYou can find Vanessa on IG @vanessareiserlcsw or at www.tellatherapist.net\n\n\nVisit: https://chantalcontorinescoaching.com to learn how to work with me. \n Grab my free parenting resource: \n https://chantalcontorinescoaching.myflodesk.com/free-how-to-guide\n Join my monthly membership for protective parents: https://chantalcontorinescoaching.com/monthly-membership\n Follow me on Instagram: @chantal.contorines.coaching\n This podcast is for educational purposes only and is not legal advice.",
