      "description": "Jon Atack, author of \u0022A Piece of Blue Sky,\u0022 joins us to unravel the complex threads of life after Scientology. With over nine years inside the church\u0027s walls, Jon shares personal insights into the manipulative tactics and broken promises that led him to question the very foundation of his beliefs. Together, we navigate the shadowy history of Scientology and the significant role that ignorance of its past plays in retaining members. Jon\u0027s journey into publishing his eye-opening book comes with its own set of challenges, including the unexpected involvement of a Scientologist in the publishing process.\n\nWithin the courtroom battlegrounds, we explore the striking parallels between Scientology\u0027s invasive security checks and legal depositions. The notorious Kendrick Moxon, head of Scientology\u0027s litigation, takes center stage as we recount efforts to uphold L. Ron Hubbard\u0027s fabricated tales. These tales often clash with reality, as evidenced by unpublished diaries that contradict Hubbard\u0027s grandiose claims of enlightenment through studies with Chinese gurus. As we shine a light on these deceptions, we stress the urgency of holding deceptive organizations accountable and ensuring the truth is brought to the forefront.\n\nTransitioning from Scientology, we reflect on the broader world of belief systems and the compelling influence of charismatic leaders. From the disillusionment within the International Society for Krishna Consciousness to the hypnotic grip of Scientology\u0027s teachings, we examine how these entities shape personal experiences and worldviews. Our conversation extends to the psychological implications of belief, touching on how personal encounters and upbringing can indelibly shape one\u0027s reality. Amidst these weighty discussions, the narrative highlights a hopeful journey toward liberation from dogma, encouraging listeners to question and search for the truth beyond comforting myths.\n\nChapters: \n00:14 - Life After Scientology - Personal Journeys\n12:10 - Ron Hubbard\u0027s Deception and Lies\n28:56 - Beliefs, Cults, and Fervor\n38:51 - Hypnotism and Guided Imagination in Scientology\n56:07 - Generational Impact of Belief Systems\n1:02:54 - Post-Scientology Reflections and Relationships\n1:14:08 - Supporting Content Creation in Scientology\n\nBFG Store: https://blownforgood-shop.fourthwall.com\nBlown For Good Website: http://blownforgood.com/\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website: https://www.buzzsprout.com/2131160/share\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blown-for-good-behind-the-iron-curtain-of-scientology/id1671284503\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6NZGCcRjr8jQRFrqugdfJK\nRSS: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/2131160.rss\n\nYOUTUBE PLAYLISTS:\nSpy Files: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq4cA-eBNXD1q9jD729pQmWk\n\nScientology Stories: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq5G35lu2nxviwc_XueI_Xmk\n\nSOCIAL:\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/blownforgood\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/blownforgoodbook\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/blownforgood/?hl=en\n- Tiktok - https://www.tiktok.com/@blownforgood\n- Twitch - https://www.twitch.tv/blownforgood\n\nThe Aftermath Foundation: https://theaftermathfoundation.org\nSP Shop: https://thespshop.com\n\n#scientology #davidmiscavige #dannymasterson #truecrime #missing #shellymiscavige  #tomcruise  #scientologyandtheaftermath #lronhubbard  #miscavige #cult #ScientologyLeaks #ScientologyBeliefs #ScientologyPractices",

      "description": "Send us a text What happens when the Church of Scientology and the LAPD join forces during the holiday season? We\u0027re pulling back the curtain on this unlikely partnership, revealing both the glitz and the controversies. From the festive \u0022Scientology Christmas Stories\u0022 at the Celebrity Center in Hollywood to the financial dealings that link stars like John Travolta and Tom Cruise with law enforcement, we tackle the complex web of influence and intrigue. You\u0027ll hear about uniformed LAPD officers taking the stage, the fundraising efforts that raise eyebrows, and the ripple effects this has on community relations. Our Thanksgiving took a unique twist this year, and we\u0027re taking you along for the ride. Broadcasting from our new studio in Colorado, Claire and I decided to bring the holiday spirit to our friends Mike and Christie in their home instead of hosting as usual. Between recounting our fishing adventures in Florida and showcasing some holiday decorations crafted by our talented friend Leah, we\u0027re offering you a glimpse into our world beyond the microphones. Expect heartfelt stories, a touch of humor, and an appreciation for the connections that make this season special. But the conversation doesn\u0027t stop at personal anecdotes. We dive into the murky waters of social media monitoring within Scientology, spotlighting actor Jim Meskimen\u0027s role as a so-called \u0022Facebook police\u0022 operative. From his efforts to sever friendships to the broader implications for ex-members like us, we explore the surreal landscape of online surveillance. Plus, find out about our ongoing support for the Aftermath Foundation through quirky giveaways and merchandise that spark joy and raise awareness.

      "description": "What if leaving a controlling organization feels like escaping an abusive relationship? This question forms the backbone of our conversation with Rachel Bernstein, a renowned therapist and cult recovery expert. Rachel shares her personal journey, sparked by her sibling\u0027s brief involvement in Scientology during their childhood, which led to shifts in family dynamics and piqued her lifelong curiosity. Together, we navigate the deceptive nature of cult front groups and the extreme measures Scientology employs to silence critics, revealing the monumental challenges faced by those supporting cult recovery.\n\nStories from individuals who have felt trapped within Scientology bring to light the parallels with abusive relationships, where fear of the outside world is ingrained. Support groups become lifelines, offering solidarity and community to those who have left, helping to reduce feelings of isolation. As we explore the gradual journey of recovery, we underscore the importance of recognizing the world as a welcoming place and embracing the help and support available. This transformative process involves understanding Scientology\u0027s control methods and finding empowerment through storytelling and reclaiming personal identity.\n\nRachel emphasizes the necessity of reclaiming one\u0027s voice and emotional intelligence post-Scientology. She provides insights into practical skills like setting boundaries, engaging in small talk, and learning to navigate mainstream society. Our discussion also highlights the importance of therapists familiarizing themselves with the unique lexicon of those from cult backgrounds, akin to learning a new language, to truly understand and support their recovery. Join us for an insightful episode filled with personal anecdotes and strategies to empower listeners in their own journeys of transformation and healing.\n\nBio: Rachel Bernstein is a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist from Los Angeles, California who has specialized in cult intervention and re-acclimation for over 30 years. Rachel serves on the advisory board of the International Cultic Studies Association and has worked with the Department of Justice providing support to cult survivors.

From halting local Dianetics book sales to advocating for a parliamentary debate, we discuss the crucial shift in public perception needed to understand Scientology as an abusive organization, with a focus on educating law enforcement about the unique challenges faced by Sea Organization members.\n\nMoving into the realm of education, we share personal stories from Greenfields, a Scientology-affiliated school, where promises of an advanced education meet the harsh reality of financial barriers. With insights into how non-Scientologist students inadvertently encounter Scientology principles, we shine a light on prominent figures like Peter Hodkin and the influence they wield. Ongoing protests and legal challenges are explored, underscoring the broad implications of Scientology\u2019s reach and the efforts to counteract their maneuvers.\n\nWe also confront the harrowing experiences within Scientology\u2019s Cadet Org, where restrictive policies and neglect paint a grim picture of childhood in the Sea Org. From systemic failures in child protection to the emotional toll on those who grew up within the organization, the discussion emphasizes the urgent need for safeguarding measures. Personal stories of isolation, neglect, and the intricate relationships within second-generation Scientology families highlight the moral responsibility to report abuses and ensure accountability. Join us as we raise awareness and provide support for those affected by the Church of Scientology.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@UCg5vDuOnC5IoIm2-QhswR2Q \n\nChapters: \n0:12 - Activism and Education\n11:00 - Schooling and Scientology Influence\n25:51 - Education and Scientology\n32:41 - Childhood in the Sea Org\n38:36 - Neglected Child Welfare in Scientology\n49:05 - Second Generation Scientology Families\n\n\nBFG Store: https://blownforgood-shop.fourthwall.com\nBlown For Good Website: http://blownforgood.com/\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website: https://www.buzzsprout.com/2131160/share\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blown-for-good-behind-the-iron-curtain-of-scientology/id1671284503\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6NZGCcRjr8jQRFrqugdfJK\nRSS: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/2131160.rss\n\nYOUTUBE PLAYLISTS:\nSpy Files: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq4cA-eBNXD1q9jD729pQmWk\n\nScientology Stories: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq5G35lu2nxviwc_XueI_Xmk\n\nSOCIAL:\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/blownforgood\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/blownforgoodbook\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/blownforgood/?hl=en\n- Tiktok - https://www.tiktok.com/@blownforgood\n- Twitch - https://www.twitch.tv/blownforgood\n\nThe Aftermath Foundation: https://theaftermathfoundation.org\nSP Shop: https://thespshop.com\n\n#scientology #davidmiscavige #dannymasterson #truecrime #missing #shellymiscavige  #tomcruise  #scientologyandtheaftermath #lronhubbard  #miscavige #cult #ScientologyLeaks #ScientologyBeliefs #ScientologyPractices",

      "description": "Imagine embarking on a journey as a curious teenager only to find yourself ensnared in an organization that reshapes your life\u0027s path. Join me, Claire Headley, as I sit down with my dear friend Phil Jones, who candidly shares his fascinating journey with Scientology that began in Ontario, Canada. From attending a Narconon lecture to experiencing hypnotic group processing sessions, Phil opens up about the unexpected detour that led him from aspiring filmmaker to navigating the shadowy corridors of the Toronto Org. His story sheds light on the internal struggles and the pull of Scientology that redirected his life\u0027s ambitions.\n\nThe conversation takes a deeply personal turn as we explore the profound impact of Scientology on family dynamics, both in Phil\u0027s life and my own. I recount my brother\u0027s unintended conversion and his subsequent role within the Office of Special Affairs, and the heart-wrenching effects of the church\u0027s disconnection policy with my sister. Phil and I grapple with the historical entanglements of Scientology with law enforcement, offering a glimpse into the notorious Guardian\u0027s Office and the raids that ensued in Canada and the US. These revelations underscore the pervasive influence of Scientology and the emotional toll it exacts on familial bonds.\n\nIn the final segment, we delve into the experience of those navigating the upper levels of Scientology auditing and the arduous journey of exiting the church. We highlight the resilience required to rebuild lives after leaving and the courage to confront the manipulative grip of the organization. From descriptions of the overwhelming nature of higher-level auditing to sharing stories of families torn apart, this episode is a heartfelt examination of the continuous efforts to raise awareness and support those affected by Scientology\u0027s reach. Whether you\u0027re familiar with Scientology or seeking to understand its inner workings, this episode offers an introspective and compelling narrative.\n\nPhil Jones YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi2q6xT3shH54fU9VKoH14g\n\nChapters:\n0:14 - Recent vs. Past Sea Org Experiences\n16:14 - Sea Org Experiences and Billboards\n25:58 - Journey to Leaving Sea Org\n40:12 - Family Ties and Scientology Departures\n47:00 - Sea Org Family Planning Policies Evolution\n58:19 - Sea Org Event Attendance Statistics\n1:02:45 - Impact of Leaving Scientology on Relationships\n1:09:01 - Sea Org Labor Practices and Scandals\n1:22:22 - Sea Org Recruitment and Experiences\n1:25:20 - Sea Org Recruitment and Assignments\n1:34:44 - Galley Gossip and Future Leadership\n1:41:14 - Giveaway and Rigged Winners Announcement\n1:54:58 - Supporting Channel Merch and Content\n\nBFG Store: https://blownforgood-shop.fourthwall.com\nBlown For Good Website: http://blownforgood.com/\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website: https://www.buzzsprout.com/2131160/share\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blown-for-good-behind-the-iron-curtain-of-scientology/id1671284503\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6NZGCcRjr8jQRFrqugdfJK\nRSS: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/2131160.rss\n\nYOUTUBE PLAYLISTS:\nSpy Files: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq4cA-eBNXD1q9jD729pQmWk\n\nScientology Stories: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq5G35lu2nxviwc_XueI_Xmk\n\nSOCIAL:\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/blownforgood\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/blownforgoodbook\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/blownforgood/?hl=en\n- Tiktok - https://www.tiktok.com/@blownforgood\n- Twitch - https://www.twitch.tv/blownforgood\n\nThe Aftermath Foundation: https://theaftermathfoundation.org\nSP Shop: https://thespshop.com\n\n#scientology #davidmiscavige #dannymasterson #truecrime #missing #shellymiscavige  #tomcruise  #scientologyandtheaftermath #lronhubbard  #miscavige #cult #ScientologyLeaks #ScientologyBeliefs #ScientologyPractices",

      "description": "Ever wondered why intelligent, capable individuals fall prey to cults? Get ready to uncover the intricate world of coercive organizations as Sarah Edmondson, former NXIVM member turned whistleblower, joins us to share her 12-year journey inside the notorious group. Sarah\u0027s transformation from a devoted follower to a fierce advocate is nothing short of riveting, and she opens up about the psychological grip these organizations can have. From the powerful impact of her book and TED talk on recognizing cults to her efforts in deprogramming others, Sarah\u0027s story is a compelling exploration of manipulation and resilience.\n\nDive into a fascinating comparison between NXIVM and Scientology as we dissect their tactics and terminologies. Discover how these organizations use specific language like \u0022tech\u0022 and \u0022processes\u0022 to control and influence their members. With personal anecdotes and detailed analyses, we reveal the striking similarities between the two groups, exposing their methods of instilling fear and suppressing dissent. By examining these parallels, we provide a clearer picture of the manipulation tactics that ensnare members and the structured procedures used to keep them compliant.\n\nThe journey of recovery after leaving a cult is complex and ongoing, and Sarah\u0027s experiences offer invaluable insights into this challenging process. Reflecting on why she stayed with NXIVM despite numerous red flags and her subsequent healing journey, Sarah emphasizes the importance of both regular and cult-specific therapy. We also explore holistic approaches to mental well-being, such as forest bathing and micro-dosing, and the significance of establishing clear boundaries. With a look ahead to exciting future projects, including season seven of \u0022A Little Bit Culty\u0022 and new initiatives to support cult survivors, this episode is a must-listen for anyone interested in understanding and overcoming the powerful allure of cults.\n\nChapters:\n\n0:12 - Life After Cults\n10:29 - Comparing Cult Tactics and Terminology\n22:40 - Unraveling Cult Manipulation and Control\n33:46 - Recovery and Healing After Leaving\n39:50 - Finding Healing and Autonomy After Collectivism\n45:26 - Exposing Scientology\u0027s Control and Manipulation\n\nLearn about Sarah Edmondson and her husband Nippy here:\nA Little Bit Culty Podcast: https://alittlebitculty.com\nhttps://www.sarahedmondson.com\nhttps://www.sarahedmondson.com/book\nSarah\u0027s Ted Talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa7uN2vo6rc\n\nBFG Store: https://blownforgood-shop.fourthwall.com\nBlown For Good Website: http://blownforgood.com/\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website: https://www.buzzsprout.com/2131160/share\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blown-for-good-behind-the-iron-curtain-of-scientology/id1671284503\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6NZGCcRjr8jQRFrqugdfJK\nRSS: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/2131160.rss\n\nYOUTUBE PLAYLISTS:\nSpy Files: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq4cA-eBNXD1q9jD729pQmWk\n\nScientology Stories: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq5G35lu2nxviwc_XueI_Xmk\n\nSOCIAL:\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/blownforgood\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/blownforgoodbook\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/blownforgood/?hl=en\n- Tiktok - https://www.tiktok.com/@blownforgood\n- Twitch - https://www.twitch.tv/blownforgood\n\nThe Aftermath Foundation: https://theaftermathfoundation.org\nSP Shop: https://thespshop.com\n\n#scientology #davidmiscavige #dannymasterson #truecrime #missing #shellymiscavige  #tomcruise  #scientologyandtheaftermath #lronhubbard  #miscavige #cult #ScientologyLeaks #ScientologyBeliefs #ScientologyPractices",

      "description": "Ever wondered how authoritarian groups like Scientology manage to exert such control over their members? Renowned author Jon Atack joins us for a riveting exploration of Scientology\u0027s psychological grip and the arduous journeys of those who break free. Jon\u0027s book, \u0022Let\u0027s Sell These People a Piece of Blue Sky,\u0022 serves as a pivotal resource for many former members seeking to heal, and in this episode, he recounts his meticulous writing process to ensure its accuracy and impact. From his own entry into Scientology in 1974 to his departure through the independent movement, Jon reveals the manipulative tactics of guilt, fear, and thought-terminating clich\u00E9s crafted by L. Ron Hubbard to enforce compliance.\n\nBut it doesn\u0027t stop there. Listen as Jon shares personal anecdotes that peel back the layers of Scientology\u2019s inner workings. Ever hear of the Operating Thetan Committee, UK? Jon\u2019s unexpected stint as chairman offers a unique lens into the organization\u2019s structure and the fervor of its followers. We touch upon the creation of the Reconnection newsletter, a beacon for disaffected members, and the contentious history of Scientology, which includes internal conflicts and the reworking of Hubbard\u2019s controversial texts. Through Jon\u0027s extensive research and collaborations with other experts, we piece together a complex and often contradictory narrative of Scientology\u0027s past.\n\nAnd what\u0027s a discussion about Scientology without addressing its darker aspects? We cover the harrowing case of Lisa McPherson, the deceptive strategies used by the organization, and the legal battles faced by publishers. Intriguingly, we also examine the influences on L. Ron Hubbard, including his curious mix of admiration and condemnation for Freud. This episode provides invaluable insights into how to encourage critical thinking among Scientologists, fostering open dialogue without coercion. Tune in for a comprehensive look at how former members navigate the challenging path to recovery and the importance of maintaining free and open communication.\n\nJon\u0027s Channel - https://www.youtube.com/@UCI4tcSMV2kEh3BooY_XFSYQ \n\nLink to Jon\u0027s book, Let\u0027s Sell these People a Piece of Blue Sky: https://www.amazon.com/dp/1482023032?psc=1\u0026smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER\u0026ref_=chk_typ_imgToDp\n\nComment on this video if you enjoy the conversation. 5 random comments will received a signed copy of Jon\u0027s book.

      "description": "Throughout this episode, we explore the resources that have helped us recover and understand the dynamics of cults, from eye-opening books and engaging podcasts to hard-hitting documentaries. We draw striking parallels with other groups like NXIVM, reflecting on Sarah Edmondson\u0027s book \u0022Scarred,\u0022 and share personal stories of how our private emails were manipulated during legal battles. By the end of this episode, you\u0027ll grasp the critical importance of separating fact from fiction.\n\nFrom the moment we left Scientology, we faced a whirlwind of challenges. We share shocking anecdotes about the ingrained mistrust of psychologists, the disillusionment with the Church\u0027s empty operations, and the global consistency of futile practices like producing and discarding unused materials. These shared internal conflicts reveal a universal struggle among former members to uncover the truth about L. Ron Hubbard and the Church.\n\nWe discuss Russell Miller\u0027s \u0022Barefaced Messiah,\u0022 exposing many fabrications of Hubbard\u0027s life, and examine the extreme measures the Church takes to suppress critical literature and voices. Highlighting changes in compensation for former Sea Org members and the infiltration of educational institutions, this episode underscores the personal risks authors take to expose the truth. Join us as we navigate the difficult yet liberating journey of uncovering the true face of Scientology.\n\nChapters:\n0:12 - Life After Scientology Discussion\n6:36 - Struggles After Leaving Scientology\n14:59 - Uncovering the Truth About Scientology\n28:35 - Unpacking Scientology Through Fiction Funding\n37:19 - Exposing Scientology Through Books\n\nScarred by Sarah Edmonson\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Scarred-Story-Escaped-NXIVM-Memoir/dp/1452184267?asc_campaign=0b1819625e60dc7adcc8a4f3bde1fd93\u0026asc_source=01H1P39M5ZSG9J6WR6B1HBK9M0\u0026tag=namespacebran492-20\n\nLet\u0027s sell these people A Piece of Blue Sky  by Jon Atack\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Lets-sell-these-people-Piece-ebook/dp/B00BF385HG/ref=sr_1_1?crid=Y2GKZFV0XDDZ\u0026dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.pnpAiaZDHoM_L3f3T70utHovrd3TAEd4ZfRbtpzMLyYTH270xI6A1UUkJ6x2Xv2Lf_CZlK943DwR9BgoCr9uU_Pd9xYnE5b5fDmjN5SAVxjk43vcAVW0Nrz3sXxd0T6z_E59O67hlMEgiU5dzTDWewkMJgOm7aZVwTGBpHD6AfUEebtrmJ02QOLwAEEMiWmMdoDcAhABt2L_WQy-U4PBEnjhogMPPmaG5uNjGkm905o.cAYt2BOFZJVsuPoE3ukszKIXfA-0Rjvmm8GYvAYNL-g\u0026dib_tag=se\u0026keywords=piece\u002Bof\u002Bblue\u002Bsky\u0026qid=1724900596\u0026s=books\u0026sprefix=piece\u002Bof\u002Bblue\u002Bsky%2Cstripbooks%2C146\u0026sr=1-1\n\nBare-Faced Messiah: The True Story of L.

In our latest episode, we sit down with former Scientology executive Mike Rinder to dissect a revealing spy document from 2007 called the \u0022Internet Handling Program.\u0022 We promise you\u0027ll gain intriguing insights into how Scientology\u0027s bureaucratic inefficiencies stem from David Miscavige\u0027s micromanagement and the relentless working conditions endured by Sea Org members. This episode is your ticket to understanding the church\u0027s covert operations and internal challenges. Join us as we explore the bizarre and often harsh realities of life within Scientology\u0027s upper echelons. Mike shares eye-opening anecdotes about surreal punishments like emptying an aeration pond by hand, the chaos of managing media flaps, and the manipulation of reports and directives from within the isolated environment of \u0022the hole.\u0022 Together, we navigate through Scientology\u0027s attempts to control its internet image and marketing strategies, peeling back the layers of their systematic yet flawed efforts to dominate online traffic and neutralize critics. Our conversation dives deep into the camaraderie among Sea Org members, the meticulous efforts behind L.

Our skirmish with Scientology\u0027s notorious legal machine is just the tip of the iceberg in this episode, as we peel back the layers on the devious tactics and prolonged warfare that the organization wields to silence its critics. From courtroom strategies to the unyielding resolve required to stand one\u0027s ground, we bring you firsthand accounts of the intricate legal battles, the exhaustion of settlement funds, and the sweet victory of speaking out without the gag of a court order. Navigating the treacherous waters of reputation management, we share a sobering tale of how Scientology\u0027s smear tactics nearly capsized our business during a pivotal financial deal.

We also shine a light on the enduring harassment from Scientology despite our long departure, underlining the conversation with a broader perspective on public awareness and the solidarity we\u0027ve found among those who\u0027ve been unjustly targeted. In the shadowy corners of Scientology, there exists a silent but significant faction of \u0022under the radar\u0022 members\u2014those who confide in us, sharing their stories and struggles.

Our latest podcast episode unveils the shocking entanglement of the controversial church within the fibers of East Grinstead Town Council. As we unpack the Daily Mail\u0027s bombshell revelations, you\u0027ll hear firsthand how \u0027safepointing\u0027 has become Scientology\u0027s modus operandi, transforming community ties into a strategic ploy for power. The journey to uncover these truths wasn\u0027t without resistance, as you\u0027ll learn through our personal accounts of the pushback from the council and the formidable wall of silence we\u0027ve been chipping away at.\n\nThe plot thickens when we turn the spotlight on the local council\u0027s dance with complicity, as we reveal the extent of their alleged collusion with Scientology\u0027s darker side. We discuss how redacted minutes and censored records are more than just bureaucratic maneuvers\u2014they are the footprints of a council struggling to maintain an image while under the church\u0027s financial charm. The tales of personal attacks faced by critics, reminiscent of Scientology\u0027s \u0027fair game\u0027 tactics, illustrate a chilling reality. Our dialogue also branches out to consider the wider implications of such financial influence on local governments, from East Grinstead to the Los Angeles Police Department, and the pressing need for transparency and accountability.\n\nIn a compelling segue, we turn our attention to the Paris Ideal Org\u0027s grand opening\u2014shadowed by controversy and strikingly low turnout. The event\u0027s subdued atmosphere and David Miscavige\u0027s absence are not mere footnotes but indicators of Scientology\u0027s wavering facade of expansion. We speculate on Miscavige\u0027s current game of hide-and-seek, all while considering Scientology\u0027s potential maneuvers for the impending Paris Olympics. Wrapping up, we acknowledge the valiant efforts of global activists like Shanti Das, whose formidable work has put Narconon\u0027s questionable practices under the microscope, inspiring us all to persist in the fight for awareness and change.\n\nApostate Alex YouTube Channel - https://www.youtube.com/@UCg5vDuOnC5IoIm2-QhswR2Q \n\nDaily Mail Scientology Article - \nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13257513/council-Sussex-fallen-spell-SCIENTOLOGY-Tom-Cruise-red-carpet-treatment.html\n\nBFG Store: https://blownforgood-shop.fourthwall.com\nBlown For Good Website: http://blownforgood.com/\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website: https://www.buzzsprout.com/2131160/share\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blown-for-good-behind-the-iron-curtain-of-scientology/id1671284503\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6NZGCcRjr8jQRFrqugdfJK\nRSS: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/2131160.rss\n\nYOUTUBE PLAYLISTS:\nSpy Files: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq4cA-eBNXD1q9jD729pQmWk\n\nScientology Stories: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq5G35lu2nxviwc_XueI_Xmk\n\nWant to support the BFG Channel?

Join us as Jessica recounts her audacious attempt to enter a Scientology center with a Kanye West impersonator, a prank that quickly took a sobering turn into false accusations and wrongful police detention. Her fearless narrative isn\u0027t just about the laugh-out-loud moments; it\u0027s a testament to her bravery as she aligns with the Aftermath Foundation, steadfast in aiding others to break free from Scientology\u0027s grasp.\n\nThe power of a hashtag or a viral video is undeniable, but when it comes to challenging Scientology\u0027s status quo, it requires a blend of audacity and innovation. Jessica Palmadessa takes us behind the scenes of her campaign to ignite a Congress petition, shrewdly capturing Scientology\u0027s influence on Capitol Hill. We\u0027ll also dive into the aftermath of a livestream event that left Scientologists scurrying from the spotlight and triggered a reduction in their Hollywood hub\u0027s activity. But every action has a reaction; Jessica\u0027s TikTok series put her in the organization\u0027s crosshairs, a stark reminder of the tightrope walked by digital activists.\n\nIn our final segment, we grapple with the weighty issues of censorship and the fervor needed to champion open conversation about organizations like Scientology. Jessica\u0027s firsthand account of confronting TikTok\u0027s headquarters underscores the delicate dance of free speech in the digital age. From learning about Scientology\u0027s unexpected ties to the LAPD to the solid backing of the Beverly Hills Police, her story is one of resilience. Despite personal setbacks, such as losing her TikTok account, Jessica\u0027s spirit remains unshaken, her resolve to reveal the truth unwavering. Her tale is a rallying cry for the community\u0027s collective effort to protect the youth and shine a relentless light on the shadowy corners of Scientology.\n\nChapters:\n0:12 - Inside the World of Scientology\n5:25 - Challenging Scientology and Social Media\n11:33 - TikTok Headquarters and Scientology Controversy\n16:17 - Insider\u0027s Perspective on Scientology\n\nJessica\u0027s Links: direct.me/jessicapalmadessa\nJessica\u0027s Petition - Investigate the Church of Scientology\u0027s tax-exempt status. https://chng.it/gDDxxHyMV4\n\nBFG Store: https://blownforgood-shop.fourthwall.com\nBlown For Good Website: http://blownforgood.com/\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website: https://www.buzzsprout.com/2131160/share\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blown-for-good-behind-the-iron-curtain-of-scientology/id1671284503\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6NZGCcRjr8jQRFrqugdfJK\nRSS: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/2131160.rss\n\nYOUTUBE PLAYLISTS:\nSpy Files: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq4cA-eBNXD1q9jD729pQmWk\n\nScientology Stories: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq5G35lu2nxviwc_XueI_Xmk\n\nWant to support the BFG Channel?

      "description": "Uncover the tangled web of life inside Scientology with us, as we continue our multi-part series centered around Jenny Linson. My wife Claire and I take you through her journey\u2014from viral moments to her familial Hollywood ties. We\u0027ll examine the alleged \u0027masturbation mission,\u0027 demystify terms like \u0022PAC Attack,\u0022 and dissect the organizational culture of the Rehabilitation Project Force. Your perception of the Sea Organization may never be the same as we traverse the humorous, the serious, and the downright bizarre stories that our audience has brought to light.\n\nThe shroud of violence allegations within Scientology takes center stage in our dissection of Jenny\u0027s staunch denials on CNN, contrasting the church\u0027s narrative with that of its detractors. Tune in for a gripping discussion on the internal power struggles, the reactions to accusations against the church leader, and the experiences of women deeply enmeshed in the organization\u0027s upper echelons. We promise a compelling investigation into how these narratives collide, crafting a picture of a community fiercely protecting its own.\n\nLastly, delve into the cloak-and-dagger world of Scientology\u0027s response to criticism, examining the orchestrated ambush of Mike Rinder and the meticulous surveillance tactics employed by the church. We\u0027ll share personal anecdotes, revealing the extent of control and capture orders, and consider the silence of former executives who\u0027ve witnessed misconduct. Join us as we invite more voices to come forward, tearing down the walls of secrecy and illuminating the darker corners of this enigmatic institution.\n\nChapters:\n0:12 - Scientology Executives\n17:12 - Scientology\u0027s History of Violence Spin\n31:43 - Claims of Abuse Within Scientology\n40:27 - Scientologists Ambushing Critics\n46:49 - Escape and Capture Orders in Scientology\n54:02 - Scientology Executive and Investigator Discussions\n\n2009 Jenny Linson affidavit: http://f.edgesuite.net/data/lwda/files/App11-Jenny-Linson.pdf\n\nApril 2010 CNN History of Violence: https://youtu.be/3Q-oHdA9kf8?si=hiBKzEthztBMTCyB\n\nApril 2010 Mike Rinder attack at Dr\u2019s office:\nhttps://www.mikerindersblog.org/34-mike-rinder-lady-killer/\n\nAudio: https://youtu.be/6W5R0Jluakc?si=3FLW631CE7KUNuzT\n\n2014 Youtube LAX attack: https://youtu.be/EG70fhg0wL4?si=THx3oWHCoK-WK5Vj\n\nBFG Store: https://blownforgood-shop.fourthwall.com\nBlown For Good Website: http://blownforgood.com/\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website: https://www.buzzsprout.com/2131160/share\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blown-for-good-behind-the-iron-curtain-of-scientology/id1671284503\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6NZGCcRjr8jQRFrqugdfJK\nRSS: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/2131160.rss\n\nYOUTUBE PLAYLISTS:\nSpy Files: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq4cA-eBNXD1q9jD729pQmWk\n\nScientology Stories: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq5G35lu2nxviwc_XueI_Xmk\n\nWant to support the BFG Channel?

      "description": "Peel back the curtain on Scientology\u0027s clandestine world where former LAPD officer Eugene Ingram steps into the spotlight, not for heroics, but for his controversial role as a Scientology private eye. Embark on this investigative journey with us as we expose Ingram\u0027s alleged misconduct and reveal how the church\u0027s legal maneuverings shield their investigators. Discover the shocking stories from the LA Times that paint a grim picture of Ingram\u0027s underworld dealings, from fencing stolen cars to playing a part in organized prostitution rings.\n\nThe saga intensifies as we uncover the audacious wiretap of Boston attorney Michael Flynn, orchestrated by Ingram under the guise of police authority. This alarming chapter in Scientology\u0027s playbook unfolds with a letter from 1985 that sets off a bombshell of privacy invasion and legal transgressions. Listen as we take apart California\u0027s wiretapping laws, explore the interconnected web of ex-officers turned PIs, and dive into the LAPD\u0027s response, led by then-Chief Darryl Gates, to the ensuing wiretapping scandal\u2014a cautionary tale of unchecked surveillance in the \u002780s.\n\nRounding out our expose, I detail a personal brush with Scientology\u0027s relentless surveillance tactics. A simple hotel visit in Hollywood escalates to a high-stakes game of pursuit with a Ford F-150, driving home the unnerving reality of being a target. The confrontation with the PI, a familiar face from my past entanglements with Scientology, lays bare the church\u0027s far-reaching grasp, as I share firsthand accounts of dodging their persistent tails. This episode doesn\u0027t just recount thrilling encounters\u2014it\u0027s a sobering reflection on the battle for personal freedom in the face of relentless intrusion.\n\nChapters:\n00:12 - Scientology Private Investigators Profiled\n17:46 - Scientology\u0027s Illegal Wiretapping Scandal\n24:10 - Scientologist\u0027s Plot and Investigator\u0027s Actions\n40:07 - Private Investigators and Scientology Surveillance\n\nTampa Bay Times Article - https://www.tampabay.com/archive/1995/01/28/police-looking-for-church-s-private-eye/\n\n1999 Tony Ortega Article - Phoenix New Times \nhttps://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/double-crossed-6431852\n\n2011 Tony Ortega Article - The Village Voice \nhttps://www.villagevoice.com/the-top-25-people-crippling-scientology-no-19-the-squirrel-busters/\n\n2016 Tony Ortega Articles - The Underground Bunker\nhttps://tonyortega.org/2016/08/02/for-scientologys-most-infamous-dirty-trickster-retirement-has-a-happy-ending/\n\nhttps://tonyortega.org/2021/03/07/the-top-25-people-enabling-scientology-no-5-the-dirty-tricks-private-eyes/\n\nFour Corners - The Ex-Files - https://topdocumentaryfilms.com/scientology-ex-files/\n\nBFG Store: https://blownforgood-shop.fourthwall.com\nBlown For Good Website: http://blownforgood.com/\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website: https://www.buzzsprout.com/2131160/share\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blown-for-good-behind-the-iron-curtain-of-scientology/id1671284503\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6NZGCcRjr8jQRFrqugdfJK\nRSS: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/2131160.rss\n\nYOUTUBE PLAYLISTS:\nSpy Files: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq4cA-eBNXD1q9jD729pQmWk\n\nScientology Stories: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq5G35lu2nxviwc_XueI_Xmk\n\nWant to support the BFG Channel?

Our dialogue unfurls the poignant tales of escape and the arduous quest for growth, underscoring our commitment to aid those grappling with similar paths. We confront the doctrine\u0027s insidious grip, scrutinizing its self-reinforcing mechanisms and the broader implications of societal control, illustrating through stark comparison to China\u0027s One Child Policy how deeply environments can shape beliefs and behaviors. The heart of our conversation lies in the courage to dismantle the constructs of Scientology, laying bare the painful process of seeking objectivity and recognizing the fallacies that once ensnared us. I recount the turbulence of challenging Scientology\u0027s communication rules\u2014rules that starkly contrast with the parental instinct to offer unconditional love. Together, we dissect the logical inconsistencies within the teachings, arriving at a staunch renouncement of the ideology through a synthesis of our lived experiences and moral reflections, all while revealing the myth-making that underscores the foundation of Scientology. Finally, the episode navigates the delicate terrain of language and thought reclamation, offering listeners a glimpse into the exercises that catalyze critical thinking and self-examination among former believers.

Our collaboration unearths the hypnotic anchors within Scientology\u0027s practices, as we shine a beacon on the alarming insights from Jon\u0027s research and his paper \u0022Never Believe a Hypnotist.\u0022\n\nSailing through Scientology\u0027s controversial waters, our conversation buoys up personal tales entwined with the Church\u0027s storied past. We share the laughter and absurdity that surface when chaos becomes the norm, while also acknowledging the gravity of the Church\u0027s influence on its members. Jon\u0027s odyssey from believer to questioner elucidates the complex methods employed by the Church to control the narrative around L. Ron Hubbard\u0027s enigmatic legacy. We unravel the fear of litigation that shrouds the industry, revealing the relentless determination required to publish stories that scrutinize Scientology.\n\nAs our journey reaches its haven, we cast light on the formidable challenge of recovering from Scientology\u0027s grasp. We explore the intricate control mechanisms employed by the Church and affirm the imperative of equipping members with comprehensive information to reassess their beliefs. With the curtains pulled back on Golden Era Productions, we expose the ethical quandaries of manipulating Hubbard\u0027s spoken and written word. Our expedition concludes by inviting you to add your voice to this critical dialogue, steering the conversation toward the hidden assets and digital fortifications of the Church, and the collective strength found in shared experiences and open discussions.\n\nEpisode links: \nNever Believe a Hypnotist - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUMwJgCGBOA\n\nPossible Origins of Dianetics and Scientology: \nPart One - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQXQaiLa2A\nPart Two - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wzlxBiAQtc\n\nRon Hubbard: Black Magic, Dianetics and the Creation of Scientology - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ILs6yB-d6A\n\nJon\u0027s author page on Amazon - https://www.amazon.com/stores/Jon-Atack/author/B000AQ53YC\n\nBFG Store: https://blownforgood-shop.fourthwall.com\nBlown For Good Website: http://blownforgood.com/\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website: https://www.buzzsprout.com/2131160/share\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blown-for-good-behind-the-iron-curtain-of-scientology/id1671284503\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6NZGCcRjr8jQRFrqugdfJK\nRSS: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/2131160.rss\n\nYOUTUBE PLAYLISTS:\nSpy Files: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq4cA-eBNXD1q9jD729pQmWk\n\nScientology Stories: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq5G35lu2nxviwc_XueI_Xmk\n\nChapters: \n\n00:13 - Scientology Whistleblowing and Book Writing\n12:13 - Insights and Experiences in Scientology\n24:22 - Hypnotism in Scientology\n38:59 - The History and Decline of Scientology\n53:05 - The Publishing Challenges of Scientology Book\n1:06:48 - Drugs and Manipulation in Scientology\n1:12:06 - Mind Control and Recovery From Scientology\n1:20:02 - Challenging Hubbard\u0027s Ideas in Scientology\n1:33:41 - Manipulation and Controversy Within Scientology Productions\n1:41:00 - Film Production and Digital Security\n1:47:30 - Hidden Files and Secrets in Scientology\n1:59:15 - YouTube Conversations\n\nWant to support the BFG Channel?

      "description": "On the 19th anniversary of my own flight from Scientology, my wife Claire joins me to share her harrowing tale of escape, a saga of defiance and cunning woven amidst the stifling grip of the organization. With the passing of L. Ron Hubbard echoing in the background, we unravel the threads of a meticulously crafted exit plan, where every covert phone call and secret suitcase packed was a step towards liberty. Claire\u0027s story is not just one of escape, but a revelation of the raw power dynamics and the choking surveillance that once dictated our lives within the group\u0027s international base.\n\nAs Claire and I dissect the events leading to her audacious break for freedom, it\u0027s a narrative that grips you with its intensity. Imagine the adrenaline of navigating a Walmart to meet a secret cab ride arranged through a torn-out phone book page, or sitting at a bus station, guarding your belongings against high-ranking members determined to drag you back. The episode lays bare the strategies and manipulations employed by Scientology, painting a vivid picture of the lengths one must go to evade the clutches of such an organization. Claire\u2019s encounter with Greg Wilhere and Sharon Johnston, known for their imposing presence within the group, epitomizes the confrontation between personal will and institutional control.\n\nThe podcast culminates with a poignant reflection on the aftermath of escape and the challenges of starting anew. The emotional turmoil of adjusting to a world of strangers, the strategies to prevent abduction, and the cathartic act of preparing a meal together are all steps on the journey towards healing. Claire\u0027s and my conversation is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the enduring quest for freedom. It\u0027s a raw look at the emotional landscape one traverses when leaving behind a life of control, and an inspiring story of the new beginnings that lie ahead.\n\nChapters \n00:13 - Scientology Escape Plan and Phone Change\n14:50 - Escape Plan and Coordination Process\n23:33 - Escape From Cult\n35:34 - Escape From a Cult, Encounter With Members\n51:47 - Escaping Scientology and Starting Over\n\nMarc\u0027s Escape Video - https://studio.youtube.com/video/i0wKHH18s0w/edit\n\nBFG Store: https://blownforgood-shop.fourthwall.com\nBlown For Good Website: http://blownforgood.com/\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website: https://www.buzzsprout.com/2131160/share\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blown-for-good-behind-the-iron-curtain-of-scientology/id1671284503\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6NZGCcRjr8jQRFrqugdfJK\nRSS: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/2131160.rss\n\nYOUTUBE PLAYLISTS:\nSpy Files: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq4cA-eBNXD1q9jD729pQmWk\n\nScientology Stories: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq5G35lu2nxviwc_XueI_Xmk\n\nWant to support the BFG Channel?

Explore with us the clandestine corners of the church\u0027s operations, from the alleged Twin Peaks holding site to the remote reaches of Petrolia, California, as we dissect the church\u0027s tactics of information control and person management. With the help of Google Earth, we scrutinize the geographic isolation that seems to be a strategic choice for Scientology\u0027s most secret bases, and we ponder the chilling implications of such an existence for someone like Shelly Miscavige. This episode pulls back the curtain on Scientology\u0027s carefully constructed facade, revealing a pattern of obfuscation apparent in high-profile cases like that of Danny Masterson and Lisa McPherson. Our conversation takes an unexpected turn when our own son\u0027s voter registration throws a spotlight on the opaque inner workings of the institution. We connect dots that might otherwise go unnoticed, from enigmatic symbols visible only from the sky to the controversial decision to build near fault lines. This is not just an investigation into the whereabouts of a missing person; it\u0027s an eye-opening journey into the heart of an organization that goes to great lengths to protect its secrets and its members \u2013 willingly or not.

      "description": "Send us a text Strap in for an extraordinary revelation as former Scientology insiders Marc \u0026 Claire Headley, Mark Fisher, and Janis Gillman Grady join us to unravel the enigma that is the Church\u0027s leadership. Their stories transport us deep into the world of L. Ron Hubbard and David Miscavige, juxtaposing Hubbard\u0027s peculiar idiosyncrasies with Miscavige\u0027s unchecked indulgence. The preservation of Hubbard\u0027s quarters, a time capsule of his existence, contrasts starkly with Miscavige\u0027s taste for opulence, from his fleet of luxury vehicles to his custom bulletproof van. Through vivid recollections, our guests peel back the layers of secrecy to expose the inner workings of one of the most elusive organizations. Our conversation steers through the choppy waters of Scientology\u0027s past, navigating through tales of overboarding at sea and the eerie calm of Hubbard\u0027s living arrangements amidst public scrutiny. Claire Headley sheds light on the financial labyrinth that is the Religious Technology Center, giving us a glimpse of the golden handcuffs that lock the higher-ups in their gilded cages. Meanwhile, anecdotes about Miscavige\u0027s personal staff and their hyper-vigilant service paint a picture of a man whose authority is as much a construct of fear as it is of reverence. Closing the lid on this Pandora\u0027s box of eye-opening narratives, we probe the strategic maneuverings that propelled Miscavige to the pinnacle of power within Scientology. From his early setbacks to his final domination, his rise is a testament to the undercurrents of coercion and control within the organization. We leave no stone unturned, exposing the seismic cultural shifts from the era of Hubbard to the age of Miscavige.

      "description": "Send us a text Embark with us on a voyage into the heart of Scientology\u0027s most guarded secrets, as Claire Headley joins me to unravel the mysteries of the Operating Thetan levels. Claire\u0027s firsthand experiences from the Sea Organization\u0027s nerve center provide a stark contrast to my own journey, which took shape after stepping away from the church. Together, we examine the mental acrobatics demanded by the church\u0027s upper echelons and navigate the complex road to liberation from its clutches, all while expressing gratitude to our diverse international audience for their unwavering engagement. This episode charts the trajectory of Scientology\u0027s evolution, from its book-centric recruitment strategies of the 1960s to today\u0027s focus on imposing structures and property acquisition. We dissect the highly clandestine upper levels of the Bridge to Total Freedom, scrutinizing the church\u0027s elusive promises and addressing the dramatic shift in focus following L. Ron Hubbard\u0027s death. Our discussion delves into the world of solo auditing, confronting the extensive whole track history, and critically analyzes the doctrine\u0027s foundations, including the notorious OT III level\u0027s galactic overlord Xenu narrative. Witness the unraveling of Scientology\u0027s opaque curtain as we explore the upper OT levels, addressing the skepticism that surrounds the practices and promises of OT powers. Claire\u0027s insights offer an invaluable glimpse into the disillusionment that many members experience upon discovering that the supernatural abilities touted by the church fail to materialize. Despite the organization\u0027s emphasis on material success as a measure of expansion, our conversation sheds light on the consequences of the organization\u0027s unfulfilled promises and the inner workings behind the believers\u0027 quest for spiritual freedom. Join us as we provide a forthright and critical perspective on the complexities and skepticism inherent in the Scientology belief system.

      "description": "Embark on a journey of transformation and discovery with Sasha Zbitnoff, who peels back the curtain on his life-altering transition from Scientology to enlightenment. Our dialogue deepens into his pivotal collaboration with Steven Hassan and his enlightening educational presentations for psychiatrists. Sasha\u0027s candid storytelling offers a treasure trove of insights, contrasting the doctrinal practices of his past with the therapeutic benefits he discovered in psychiatric counseling. His reflections illustrate the profound shifts that can occur when we bravely step away from the familiar and confront our deeply held beliefs.\n\nHave you ever wandered through the physical and metaphorical corridors of the Scientology landscape? Sasha guides us through the famous LA complex and Celebrity Center, recounting his life\u0027s timeline within the community, and sharing experiences that resonate with former members. As we explore the practices of auditing and the elusive quest for \u0027clear\u0027 status, Sasha draws parallels and distinctions between Scientology and psychiatric methodologies. His narrative is rich with personal anecdotes, offering a glimpse into the heart of Scientology and the redemptive power of questioning and seeking truth.\n\nWitness Sasha\u0027s remarkable evolution as he discusses his journey from staunch opposition to psychiatric drugs to an unexpected career in the biotech industry. Confronting his past prejudices, he embraces a newfound appreciation for psychiatric medication\u0027s role in mental health.

      "description": "When the foundations of your world are shaken by the hard truths of a life once lived under the stringent control of the Church of Scientology, where do you find the strength to speak out? Jon, a tech expert and former Scientologist, joins me, Claire Headley, to unravel his deeply personal history within this enigmatic organization. Our conversation is a tapestry of courage and vulnerability, exploring the disconnection policy\u0027s impact on Jon\u0027s family ties, his formative years at St Hill and Greenfields School, and the psychological warfare he endured.\n\nVenturing into the heart of Scientology\u0027s paradoxical nature, we confront the harsh realities that lurk beneath the surface of its self-proclaimed ecclesiastical veneer. Jon recounts the chilling \u0027Fair Game\u0027 policy and the manipulation he witnessed under the guise of religious training, while we dissect the broader implications of compliance without question - a stark reminder of the perils of absolute obedience to any authority. Together, we peel back the layers, exposing the damage inflicted upon the human spirit by systems of control masquerading as sanctuaries of faith.\n\nThe human yearning for freedom often leads to extraordinary measures, and it\u0027s within these tales of escape that the resilience of the spirit truly shines. We share gripping narratives, from my own involvement in aiding a couple\u0027s clandestine departure to Jon\u0027s strategic evasion of the ever-vigilant security teams, each tale echoing the tumultuous journey from oppression to autonomy. With poignant reflections on lost bonds and the long road to recovery, this episode stands as a testament to those who dare to reclaim their lives from the clutches of high-control groups.\n\nOUTLINE:\n00:13 - Experiences in Scientology and Escaping\n16:48 - Exploring the Destructive Nature of Scientology\n30:57 - Power and Control in Scientology\n38:23 - Escaping a Controlling Organization\n49:38 - Escape From Scientology\n57:17 - Escape Plan and Kitty Conversation\n1:02:48 - Escape and Reflections on Scientology Belief\n1:15:53 - Scientology Recovery and Charles Manson\n\nBooks by Jon Atack:\nLet\u2019s sell these people A Piece of Blue Sky\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Lets-sell-these-people-Piece-ebook/dp/B00BF385HG/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2OJKHFAAEY6RD\u0026keywords=jon\u002Batack\u0026qid=1704745333\u0026sprefix=jon\u002Batack%2Caps%2C129\u0026sr=8-1 \n\u00A0\nScientology: The Cult of Greed\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Scientology-Cult-Greed-Jon-Atack-ebook/dp/B00QVDPM62/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2OJKHFAAEY6RD\u0026keywords=jon\u002Batack\u0026qid=1704745333\u0026sprefix=jon\u002Batack%2Caps%2C129\u0026sr=8-2 \n\nOpening Our Minds: Avoiding Abusive Relationships and Authoritarian Groups\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Opening-Our-Minds-Relationships-Authoritarian/dp/B09F898DB6/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2OJKHFAAEY6RD\u0026keywords=jon\u002Batack\u0026qid=1704745333\u0026sprefix=jon\u002Batack%2Caps%2C129\u0026sr=8-3 \n\nBFG Store now Live!  https://blownforgood-shop.fourthwall.com\nBlown For Good Website: http://blownforgood.com/\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website: https://www.buzzsprout.com/2131160/share\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blown-for-good-behind-the-iron-curtain-of-scientology/id1671284503\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6NZGCcRjr8jQRFrqugdfJK\nRSS: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/2131160.rss\n\nYOUTUBE PLAYLISTS:\nSpy Files: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq4cA-eBNXD1q9jD729pQmWk\n\nScientology Stories: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq5G35lu2nxviwc_XueI_Xmk\n\nWant to support the BFG Channel?

      "description": "Every journey has its twists and turns, but few are as deeply transformative as Sasha Zbitnoff\u0027s escape from the life he was born into, a life steeped in Scientology. Join me, Claire Headley, for a riveting conversation where Sasha bares his soul about the trials and tribulations he faced from a Scientology-affiliated upbringing to the moment of clarity that propelled him to chart a new course. His gripping account offers an inside look at the intimate yet often suffocating embrace of the church\u0027s community, challenging us to reflect on the true cost of conformity.\n\nSasha\u0027s narrative is not just a story of leaving; it\u0027s a profound exploration of identity, belief, and the resilience of the human spirit. As he recounts the cultural veneration of L. Ron Hubbard and shares personal anecdotes from those who knew the founder, we gain a rare understanding of the sacrifices demanded by loyalty to such an organization. This episode peels back the layers of a tightly woven support system that can both uplift and oppress, offering listeners an opportunity to witness the complexities of healing and the strength required to walk away from all that\u0027s familiar.\n\nIn the poignant chapters of Sasha\u0027s life, we traverse the emotional landscapes of familial rifts, the silent rules that govern belief, and the daunting task of rebuilding life outside the church\u0027s confines. True courage shines through his story, from the heartbreak of disconnection to the solace found in shared experiences of loss and hope. Tune in to hear how Sasha, against all odds, reconstructs a life of authenticity and purpose, proving that the toughest battles can lead to the most meaningful victories.\n\nOUTLINE:\n00:12 - Leaving Scientology Experiences\n9:54 - Discovering Scientology and Reflecting on LRH\n16:06 - Discovering the Truth About Scientology\n29:05 - Scientology and Similar Group Comparisons\n35:31 - Disconnecting From Scientology and Rebuilding Life\n45:20 - Personal Experiences Within Scientology\n\nBare-Faced Messiah: The True Story of L.

      "description": "Send us a text Nineteen years ago, I did the unthinkable\u2014I broke out from the iron grip of the Scientology International Headquarters. This tale isn\u0027t just about my escape; it\u0027s a deep dive into the heart of a clandestine world many have heard of but few have seen. We\u0027re taking you through the tightly guarded compounds of Golden Era Productions and the Religious Technology Center, sharing firsthand the intense disciplinary rituals, the sparse living conditions, and the infamous \u0027Hole\u0027. With vivid visual aids, we peel back the curtain on David Miscavige\u0027s quarters and open up about the scarcity of joy in a place where recreation was a mere whisper. The relentless pursuit of freedom is a theme that resonates with so many, yet the stakes in this narrative are unimaginably high. Join Claire and me as we recount the multiple escape attempts from the Sea Org, including a heart-stopping moment thwarted by the very security meant to keep us in line. You\u0027ll hear about the covert communications, the meticulously planned routes, and the unexpected allies that helped tip the scale in our favor. This episode is far more than an action-packed thriller\u2014it\u0027s a testament to the resilience of the human spirit. As we wrap up this riveting journey, the warmth of gratitude envelops us. We extend our heartfelt thanks to Catherine Olson for her unwavering support, and we celebrate the milestones that followed our escape\u2014the anniversaries, the independence, and the joy of reconnecting with life\u0027s simple pleasures. From amusing memories at HowdyCon Denver to the promise of a nearly realized TED Talk, I share a profound appreciation for the community that\u0027s stood by our side. Embark on this episode and join a community that values truth and freedom as we ensure these hidden stories are brought to light.

      "description": "Send us a text Imagine the high stakes world of celebrity image management as a shadowy chess game, where every move is calculated and every player has an agenda. This week, we expose the secret strategies employed by the Church of Scientology to sculpt the media narrative around Tom Cruise, revealing a saga that intertwines with industry titans like Oprah Winfrey and John Travolta. Our investigation peels back layers of carefully crafted PR maneuvers, following a trail of internal documents that bring to light the Church\u0027s reaction to Cruise\u0027s contentious Matt Lauer interview and the potential fallout from an Oprah show featuring Brooke Shields. The plot thickens as we reveal the complex web of communications orchestrated by powerhouse Creative Artists Agency (CAA) to avert a media crisis. Listen as we recount the precise steps taken by Tom Cruise\u0027s sister and PR representative, Leanne, in concert with CAA\u0027s Kevin Huvane, as they navigate a turbulent sea of high-profile challenges. These machinations are set against the looming influence of David Miscavige and the Church of Scientology, whose efforts to command the narrative reveal a sophisticated understanding of the entertainment industry\u0027s inner workings. Our episode culminates with a tactical dissection of the documents outlining the Church\u0027s overarching plans to mitigate negative press. We examine how Scientology leverages its celebrity centers and the Office of Special Affairs to enlist high-profile figures in a symphony of image management. Uncover the truths behind the public relations campaigns that employ military precision to safeguard the reputations of Scientology\u0027s elite members, and the far-reaching impact this has on our understanding of influence, media, and the subtle art of perception control.

      "description": "Send us a text Growing up is hard. Growing up in the world of Scientology? That\u0027s an entirely different challenge. Join me, your host Claire Headley, as we traverse this uncharted territory with our guest, Miriam Francis. An individual who, like me, was inducted into Scientology\u0027s Sea Org as a child, Miriam offers us an intimate glimpse into her journey - the emotional struggles, broken relationships, and a sense of self fighting for survival in an environment that gave precedence to the organization over family. As children, we were subjected to rigorous training and discipline within the organization. We were made to feel responsible for the workings of a complex entity that, in a bizarre twist, had us instructing adults. This experience, though challenging, was not unique to us. The episode focuses not just on our narratives but on giving voice to other children of Scientology. We aim to bring their often overlooked experiences into the spotlight, offering listeners a rare insight into the reality of Scientology. Our conversation delves into the trials of growing up in such an environment, right from the trauma our mothers faced within Scientology, to our early childhood days filled with confusion and chaos. We discuss the distressing reality of child labor, restrictive environment, and the pressure to conform, all while struggling with mental health within the Sea Org. We also highlight the importance of child protection in controversial organizations like Scientology. So, join us as we navigate these turbulent waters together and shed light on narratives seldom heard. Stay tuned for part two of our conversation as we continue revealing these stories.

      "description": "Join us for a compelling discussion with Geoff Levin, who uncovers his personal journey through, and eventually out of, Scientology. Through heartrending stories of destruction and disconnection, Geoff brings to light the hidden realities of this organization. You\u0027ll glean insights about the pressures to comply with Scientology\u0027s teachings and the adverse effects of its manipulation on mental health. Geoff\u0027s narrative is not all gloom and doom, though. His documentary \u0022Brothers Broken\u0022 stands testament to his resilience and liberation from the clutches of Scientology.The conversation further unravels the layers of Scientology through stories of hope and recovery shared by other ex-members. Their stories bear testament to the power of shared experiences and their potential to impact and inspire others grappling with similar situations. You\u0027ll hear firsthand accounts of the inner workings of the Sea Org, from a member who worked closely with Hubbard himself. The audaciousness of their decision to leave the ship, a move orchestrated by Hubbard, paints a fascinating picture of life within the Sea Org.Wrapping up this evocative episode, we engage in a heartening dialogue about overcoming challenges and finding success after Scientology.

Join us, and our guests, Leah Remini and Mike Rinder, as we explore this chilling concept. We delve into Scientology policy, examine its potential influence on law enforcement, and question the church\u0027s reaction to allegations of criminal behavior within its ranks. We illuminate the real-world outcomes of deviating from Scientology\u0027s strict code of law and ponder why the mainstream media isn\u0027t delving deeper into the Church\u0027s inner workings. Fasten your seatbelts as we recount the tragic story of Stacey Moxon, and scrutinize the underhand strategies employed by Scientology to mislead law enforcement. We reveal the role of David Miscavige, the leader of the Church, in perpetuating a culture of deceit within the organization. This conversation exposes the unsettling lengths Scientology will go to protect its image, and the chilling belief that deception is defensible as long as it safeguards what they consider to be mankind\u0027s only salvation. We don\u0027t stop there. We share our personal encounters with law enforcement, revealing the varied reactions we have received when providing information about Scientology. We discuss the influence of Scientology\u0027s donations on local law enforcement, its response to missing persons reports, and the challenges faced by those brave enough to expose the organization\u0027s wrongdoings. Join us as we shine a light on the dark underbelly of Scientology, encouraging you, our listeners, to stay informed, get involved, and continue to question the actions of this organization.

This episode is a trove of intriguing revelations and thought-provoking discussions, not just for those interested in Scientology, but for any curious mind intrigued by the complexities of human behavior and belief systems.\n\nKaren\u0027s Book: Escaping Scientology - https://www.amazon.com/Escaping-Scientology-Insiders-Celebrity-Spirituality-ebook/dp/B075MB8WKC/ref=sr_1_1?crid=T44IL7J9IJ6L\u0026keywords=Escaping\u002BScientology\u0026qid=1693893350\u0026sprefix=escaping\u002Bscientology\u002B%2Caps%2C115\u0026sr=8-1\nBFG Store now Live!  https://blownforgood-shop.fourthwall.com\nBlown For Good Website: http://blownforgood.com/\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website: https://www.buzzsprout.com/2131160/share\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blown-for-good-behind-the-iron-curtain-of-scientology/id1671284503\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6NZGCcRjr8jQRFrqugdfJK\nRSS: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/2131160.rss\n\nYOUTUBE PLAYLISTS:\nSpy Files: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq4cA-eBNXD1q9jD729pQmWk\n\nScientology Stories: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq5G35lu2nxviwc_XueI_Xmk\n\n\nOUTLINE:\n0:03 - The Search for Shelly Miscavige\n11:53 - Office Spaces and Leadership Discussions\n23:47 - Scientology Uniforms and Office Transformations\n37:57 - Financial Irregularities at RTC\n49:22 - Mental State Concerns and Shelley\u0027s Reaction\n1:09:01 - Paranoia and Cold Steel in Scientology\n1:22:22 - David Miscavige\u0027s Paranoia and Isolation Policies\n\n\nWant to support the BFG Channel?

      "description": "Could you imagine the uncertainty of not knowing where your family member is for over a decade? That\u0027s the painful reality for our guest Sterling Tompkins, who joins us in this stirring episode to discuss the puzzling case of Shelly Miscavige, the wife of the Scientology leader, David Miscavige. Shelly, once an ever-present figure, who has been conspicuously absent from public view since 2005, stirring a whirlpool of questions and theories. Sterling, Shelly\u0027s brother-in-law and nephew, lends a unique perspective to our conversation as we traverse the complex family dynamics and the enigma encircling Shelly\u0027s absence.\n\nThis isn\u0027t just a chat about a disappearance; it\u0027s a deep dive into the intricacies of our shared experiences within the Church of Scientology. We reminisce about our respective families, our upbringing within the institution, and the strains on our relationships triggered by David Miscavige\u0027s influence. We recall the memories of Shelly and David and how the aftermath of Lisa McPherson\u0027s wrongful death in 1995 marked a significant turn in their relationship.\n\nBut our chat doesn\u0027t end there. We take a moment to reflect on the present and the future - how our past experiences have molded us, and the importance of recognizing those who\u0027ve managed to do good despite the Church\u0027s practices. We open the floor to our audience, inviting you to engage with us in our ongoing conversation about our experiences and the different perspectives they bring. Join us, as we continue to untangle this complex narrative and illuminate the darker corners of our shared history.\n\nSubscribe to Sterling\u0027s channel here:\nhttps://youtube.com/@leavingscientologylovinglife\n\nBFG Store now Live!  https://blownforgood-shop.fourthwall.com\nBlown For Good Website: http://blownforgood.com/\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website: https://www.buzzsprout.com/2131160/share\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blown-for-good-behind-the-iron-curtain-of-scientology/id1671284503\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6NZGCcRjr8jQRFrqugdfJK\nRSS: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/2131160.rss\n\nYOUTUBE PLAYLISTS:\nSpy Files: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq4cA-eBNXD1q9jD729pQmWk\n\nScientology Stories: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq5G35lu2nxviwc_XueI_Xmk\n\nOUTLINE:\n0:02 - Intro\n7:13 - Family Relationships and Connections\n16:37 - Memories and Relationships With Shelley\n25:51 - Parental Involvement\u0027s Impact on Childhood\n33:08 - Memories of Shelley and David\n44:31 - Future Conversations and Story Comparisons\n\n\nWant to support the BFG Channel?

Thanks and sorry for the inconvenience. \n\n\nUncover the murky mysteries of Scientology with me and my  friend, Bruce Hines, as we delve into a chilling tale of disappearance and conjecture. Can you imagine what it\u0027s like to disappear from the face of the earth? Shelly Miscavige, wife of Scientology leader David Miscavige, did just that and has been missing for 18 years. Bruce, who knew and worked with Shelly, shares his personal insights and experiences, offering a rare look into the lives of David and Shelly Miscavige within the confines of the Scientology headquarters.\n\nJourney back with us to our time living at the International Base 8, a place infused with the aroma of garlic fields and the haunting echoes of tragic losses. We reminisce about the peculiar Christmas morning interactions with Shelly, revealing a human side rarely seen in the stern environment of Scientology. As we dive deeper, Bruce recounts the devastating death of fellow Scientologist Andy Hoden and his eerie experience of being present when she passed away. A story that intertwines tragedy, loss, and the enigmatic mechanisms of the Scientology church.\n\nJoin us as we dissect the harsh conditions of Shelly\u0027s seclusion, the alleged brainwashing techniques, and the stringent security measures at the International Base.

      "description": "Prepare yourself for a voyage into Scientology\u0027s stormy seas as my guest, Hana Eltringham Whitfield, and I share our intense experiences from our time in the Sea Organization. Imagine being tasked with the impossible - securing a new home for 300 students and staff in Alicante, all on a Saturday night. We recount these moments of chaos, the high-stakes interactions with a local cab driver, and our triumph amidst turmoil when we finally secured a building.\n\nSet sail with us as we revisit the turbulent journey from Valencia onboard the Avon River. It wasn\u0027t smooth sailing, to say the least. As I took over the helm, we battled unpredictable weather, avoided troll boats, and bore witness to L. Ron Hubbard\u0027s unforgettable domestic disputes - broadcasted via bullhorn for the entire ship to hear. Our expedition was fraught with danger but also tinged with the scent of adventure and freedom.\n\nNow, brace for impact as we expose the chilling underbelly of Scientology\u0027s manipulation tactics. Listen closely as Leon and Amos, two of our fellow Sea Org members, recount their covert mission to Tunisia. Their task? To secure the release of Mrs. Vicky Livingston from airport security using nothing but an elaborate cover story and a symbolic red silk rosette. Their chilling success offers a window into the disturbing ways Scientology manipulates government officials and police forces, a practice still in effect today. Buckle up for an emotional whirlwind as we unpack these real-life adventures and chilling tales from the enigmatic world of Scientology.

      "description": "Are you ready to be moved, challenged, and enlightened? Brace yourselves for a deeply engaging conversation with Katherine Spallino, the author of \u0027The Bad Cadet\u0027, as we unpack her intimate journey of growing up in, and ultimately escaping from, the confines of the Scientology Cadet Organization. Hear directly from Katherine herself about the indoctrination she experienced from a young age, her hard-fought journey to reclaim her freedom and the resilience it took to navigate the often tumultuous waters of familial relationships within the organization.\n\nThis isn\u0027t just about the captivating narrative of one woman\u0027s escape from a high-control organization - it\u0027s also about the transformative power of language and the potent role it plays in healing. We\u0027ll explore Katherine\u0027s writing process, the invaluable support she received, and the parallels drawn between Scientology\u0027s control mechanisms and George Orwell\u0027s dystopian novel, \u00271984\u0027. Is there something to be gleaned from resources like Victor Frankl\u0027s \u0027Man\u0027s Search for Meaning\u0027 and Tara Westover\u0027s \u0027Educated\u0027? Stick with us to find out.\n\nFinally, we\u0027ll delve into the significant role of platforms like YouTube in amplifying stories that often elude mainstream media. Hear how sharing her personal experiences became a therapeutic process for Katherine and how connections outside of Scientology can serve as lifelines for those still inside. From the depths of the challenges to the peaks of gratitude for the support and validation she received throughout her journey, Katherine\u0027s story is one you won\u0027t want to miss.\n\nKatherine\u0027s book:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Bad-Cadet-Growing-Scientologys-Organization-ebook/dp/B0C1TCQ1KQ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1W8ACLHPOIKW2\u0026keywords=bad\u002Bcadet\u0026qid=1691520563\u0026sprefix=bad\u002Bcadet%2Caps%2C150\u0026sr=8-1\n\nKatherine\u0027s YouTube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@thebadcadet\n\nBFG Store now Live!  https://blownforgood-shop.fourthwall.com\nBlown For Good Website: http://blownforgood.com/\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website: https://www.buzzsprout.com/2131160/share\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blown-for-good-behind-the-iron-curtain-of-scientology/id1671284503\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6NZGCcRjr8jQRFrqugdfJK\nRSS: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/2131160.rss\n\nYOUTUBE PLAYLISTS:\nSpy Files: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq4cA-eBNXD1q9jD729pQmWk\n\nScientology Stories: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq5G35lu2nxviwc_XueI_Xmk\n\n\nOUTLINE:\n\n00.00:14 - Scientology Experiences With Katherine Spallino\n00:11:59 - Leaving Scientology, Gaining Perspective\n00:15:13 - Comparing Literature to Scientology\n19:53 - Discussion on Scientology and Writing Process\n21:23 - Discussion on Scientology and Writing Process\n29:44 - Escaping Scientology and Reclaiming Freedom\n41:03 - Reconnecting With Family Outside of Scientology\n52:59 - Author\u0027s Gratitude for Support and Validation\n\n\nSupport the Channel: \n\nPaypal Link - No Paypal account needed\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=7ZXJBQVYP4WXS\n\n\nThinking of buying a Tesla?

      "description": "Join me as I embark on an incredible journey with my dear friend Cindy Plahuta, taking a deep dive into her strange and fascinating experience with Scientology. Her tale unfolds from a unique encounter with the organization in the early 90s, our shared memories at the Celebrity Center, and the shocking conversations that followed my initiation into the Sea Organization. The path is fraught with revelations as Cindy peels back the layers of her time within the organization, the eerie call to the ethics office, her ascent through the OT Levels, and the heartbreaking declaration of her friend\u0027s brother-in-law as a suppressive person.\n\nOur heartfelt conversation takes a tender turn as we ponder upon the concept of chosen family and the excruciating pain of disconnection that Scientology imposes. We cherish the beautiful times we had together, even as we navigate the sinister aspects of Cindy\u0027s experience - the surveillance, the financial burden, and the risks associated with aligning with this organization. But don\u0027t think for a minute that it\u0027s all doom and gloom. There are chuckles to be had, particularly when we touch upon the importance of having a will in place, a topic that takes an unexpected, humorous detour.\n\nFinally, we lighten the mood as Cindy brings us into the warmth of her kitchen with her new venture, CiCi\u0027s Comfort Cooking. It\u0027s a delightful end to a conversation that spans decades, numerous challenges, and the kind of friendship that withstands the test of time and trials.

      "description": "What happens when a life built within the confines of Scientology comes face to face with the harsh reality of personal loss, family estrangement, and a back-breaking search for truth? Our guest today, Liz Ferris, embarks on a journey to answer these very questions. Walk with us as Liz peels back the layers of her story, recounting her childhood within the organization, the severance of ties with her father, Bob Ferris, her tumultuous coming-out experience, and the uncomfortable truth about Scientology\u0027s stance on love and personal relationships.\n\nIn a world where you never compare notes about experiences, Liz\u0027s narrative is a beacon of hope and strength. Through the ups and downs of her quest for her long-lost father, Liz chronicles everything - from the crushing defeat of leaving the Scientology compound, to the unwavering support she finds in her friend Vanessa and her partner. We traverse through the labyrinth of family issues, restraining orders, and the uncanny similarities to North Korea, all while emphasizing the significance of having a mandatory reporter by your side.\n\nAs Liz\u0027s search for Bob Ferris continues, she faces an onslaught of challenges - false report numbers, deceptive elder protective services, and the frustration of navigating an untrustworthy system. Yet, hope shines through as we discuss the strides Liz is making to find answers - obtaining police reports and looking into body camera footage. Despite the obstacles, Liz stands tall, drawing strength from her partner and the promise of truth that lies ahead. Buckle up as we explore this rollercoaster journey, a testament to Liz Ferris\u0027 resilience and a story you won\u0027t want to miss.\n\nBFG Store now Live!  https://blownforgood-shop.fourthwall.com\nBlown For Good Website: http://blownforgood.com/\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website: https://www.buzzsprout.com/2131160/share\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blown-for-good-behind-the-iron-curtain-of-scientology/id1671284503\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6NZGCcRjr8jQRFrqugdfJK\nRSS: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/2131160.rss\n\nYOUTUBE PLAYLISTS:\nSpy Files: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq4cA-eBNXD1q9jD729pQmWk\n\nScientology Stories: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq5G35lu2nxviwc_XueI_Xmk\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nSupport the Channel: \n\nPaypal Link - No Paypal account needed\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=7ZXJBQVYP4WXS\n\n\nThinking of buying a Tesla?

      "description": "What would you do if the world as you knew it was completely governed by a single organization? Can you imagine a childhood devoid of ordinary comforts, where even your education was dictated by a religious organization? This episode tells the chilling tale of one woman, Shelly Miscavige, who lived this life and more, within the formidable walls of the Church of Scientology.\n\nLife wasn\u0027t always about billion-year contracts and being a messenger of the church for Shelly. Take a trip with us to her early days in Texas, where her parents\u0027 involvement with the Church of Scientology began. We explore how Scientology quickly consumed her family, leading to Shelly\u0027s parents leaving her and her siblings while they travelled to England. This departure marked the beginning of the fractures within her family, a significant event that would later shape Shelly\u0027s life. We also unearth the disturbing chapters from her childhood, which saw her living in questionable conditions in Mexico, forced to hide at the sight of authorities.\n\nDelving deeper into Shelly\u0027s life, we discuss her time as a part of the Commodore\u0027s Messenger Organization, Golden Era Productions, and Author Services in Los Angeles. We illuminate the changes that came with David Miscavige taking over the Religious Technology Center, leading to her recall to the headquarters in 1987. Finally, we bring to light her relationship with L Ron Hubbard and the interesting story behind her nickname, \u0027Miss Panache\u0027. This episode offers a thorough exploration of the life and disappearance of Shelly Miscavige, pulling back the veil on the often-secretive world of Scientology. Tune in as we unravel this mysterious tale.\n\nEDITOR NOTE: We are aware there is a bit of static in this video but it is only when Marc is talking so we left it.

      "description": "The Aftermath Foundation was established to help those who want to leave Scientology and the Sea Organization, but who lack a system of support they can rely on while getting on their feet in the outside world.\n\nThis is an Aftermath Foundation Survivor Story: The Story of Serge Obolensky.\n\nSerge was raised in scientology from a very young age and joined the Sea Organization at age 11, committing to a billion years of service to scientology. Serge\u0027s parents and his brothers were also part of the Sea Organization. After several years of hard labor, no education, no family support, and a rigorous schedule, Serge\u0027s life was in ruins. At age 19, while he was living on L Ron Hubbard Way, Serge had a fireworks accident in which he lost both of his hands and one of his eyes. Thereafter he was promptly cut off from his family and all mental and emotional support, as a result of which Serge was homeless on Hollywood Blvd for 10 years.\n\nThe Aftermath Foundation presents The Story of Serge Obolensky.\n\nBFG Store is now Live!  https://blownforgood-shop.fourthwall.com\n\nSubscribe to SPTV:  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/@michaelrinder5831\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@GrowingUpInScientology\n\nBlown For Good Website: http://blownforgood.com/\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website: https://www.buzzsprout.com/2131160/share\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blown-for-good-behind-the-iron-curtain-of-scientology/id1671284503\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6NZGCcRjr8jQRFrqugdfJK\nRSS: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/2131160.rss\n\nYOUTUBE PLAYLISTS:\nSpy Files: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq4cA-eBNXD1q9jD729pQmWk\n\nScientology Stories: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq5G35lu2nxviwc_XueI_Xmk\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nSupport the Channel: \n\nPaypal Link - No Paypal account needed\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=7ZXJBQVYP4WXS\n\n\nThinking of buying a Tesla?

      "description": "- Step right into a world of subterfuge and covert operations as we pull back the curtain on Scientology\u0027s secret spy network. This episode guarantees to leave you awestruck and bemused by the lengths to which Scientology went in order to divulge the identity of our spy. We\u0027ll be discussing everything from the purchasing of phone records to the rummaging of garbage, and the activation of Scientologist spies and private investigators. Get ready for a captivating tale about our contact who bravely risked it all to provide us with crucial materials and an escape route from the Cine Castle.\n\nStay tuned as we unravel the intricate web of Scientology\u0027s hunt for the intriguing spy code-named \u0027BFG\u0027. It\u0027s a journey that involves Chuck Beatty, an ex-Sea Org member, and the far-reaching influence of Tom Cruise\u0027s lawyer, Burt Fields. We\u0027ll also delve into the peculiar last years of L. Ron Hubbard, and his curious choice to pen science fiction books, leaving Scientology with a questionable succession plan. And as a cherry on top, we\u0027ll have a sneak peek into a real-life spy-studded birthday party. So, buckle up for an episode brimming with suspense, intrigue, and unexpected twists. It\u0027s a ride you won\u0027t want to miss!\n\nJoin us for another episode of the Scientology Spy Files. In this episode we cover two different OSA Internal (Scientology Spy Wing) documents from May 2006. \n\nBFG Store now Live!  https://blownforgood-shop.fourthwall.com\n\nSubscribe to SPTV:  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/@michaelrinder5831\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@GrowingUpInScientology\n\n#scientology #davidmiscavige #dannymasterson #shellymiscavige #davemiscavige #scientologyandtheaftermath #sptv \n\nBlown For Good Website: http://blownforgood.com/\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website: https://www.buzzsprout.com/2131160/share\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blown-for-good-behind-the-iron-curtain-of-scientology/id1671284503\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6NZGCcRjr8jQRFrqugdfJK\nRSS: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/2131160.rss\n\nYOUTUBE PLAYLISTS:\nSpy Files: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq4cA-eBNXD1q9jD729pQmWk\n\nScientology Stories: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq5G35lu2nxviwc_XueI_Xmk\n\n\nOUTLINE:\n\n0:02 - Investigation of Scientology\u0027s Spy Network\n11:51 - Leak and Spy Investigation in Scientology\n28:29 - Scientology Spy Files and Updates\n\n\n\nSupport the Channel: \n\nPaypal Link - No Paypal account needed\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=7ZXJBQVYP4WXS\n\n\nThinking of buying a Tesla?

      "description": "BFG Store now Live! \nhttps://blownforgood-shop.fourthwall.com\n\nIn this series we will explore the life and experiences of Shelly Miscavige, leading up to Shelly\u0027s current status as one of many missing executives in Scientology. Shelly was the second in command to David Miscavige for many years, not to mention she is his wife. Now she hasn\u0027t been seen or heard from in many years. How can someone outright disappear in today\u0027s world? How does Scientology get away with this? How can Scientology\u0027s programming run so deep that people in Scientology accept this as normal? Our first guest is Marc Headley, who we interview to get Marc\u0027s perspective and experience having known and worked with Shelly Miscavige for 15 years at the 500 acre compound located in Gilman Hot Springs, CA.\n\nSubscribe to SPTV:  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/@michaelrinder5831\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@GrowingUpInScientology\n\n#scientology #davidmiscavige #dannymasterson #shellymiscavige #davemiscavige #scientologyandtheaftermath #sptv \n\nBlown For Good Website: http://blownforgood.com/\n\nBFG Store:\nhttp://blownforgood-shop.fourthwall.com/\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website: https://www.buzzsprout.com/2131160/share\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blown-for-good-behind-the-iron-curtain-of-scientology/id1671284503\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6NZGCcRjr8jQRFrqugdfJK\nRSS: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/2131160.rss\n\nYOUTUBE PLAYLISTS:\nSpy Files: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq4cA-eBNXD1q9jD729pQmWk\n\nScientology Stories: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq5G35lu2nxviwc_XueI_Xmk\n\nSupport the Channel: \n\nPaypal Link - No Paypal account needed\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=7ZXJBQVYP4WXS\n\nThinking of buying a Tesla?

The Scientology Spy wing (OSA) is writing to International Scientology Management updating them all the information they have on our business and what we are doing daily in our lives from their Scientology Spies. In the second document, they detail out some of the spies they currently have and who they think they might be able to control.

      "description": "What if the real drama of Scientology isn\u0027t just in the tabloids, but in the shredded pages and rewritten narratives of its own tech volumes? In this riveting episode, Mike Rinder joins us to unravel the bizarre and often contentious world of Scientology. From the erratic leadership of David Miscavige to astonishing real estate fraud scandals, we pull back the curtain on a world that is both perplexing and fascinating. This episode is a rollercoaster of insights, humor, and hard-hitting truths, and we can\u2019t wait for you to join the conversation.\n\nEngage with us as we brainstorm ways to support her work and keep the momentum going without overwhelming our co-host, Claire. \n\nThroughout the episode, we weave through anecdotes, jokes, and serious discussions, celebrating milestones and reflecting on the peculiar and often costly journey to become a Scientologist. From humorous takes on Scientology Twitter trolls to the whimsical world of bobble picks, laughter punctuates our critique of the Church\u2019s quirky practices and historical oddities. As we close, we underscore the mission of the Aftermath Foundation, offering support and resources for those making the brave decision to leave Scientology behind. Join us for an evening full of revelations, creativity, and community spirit.\n\nBFG Store - http://blownforgood-shop.fourthwall.com/\n\r\nWe might have some special guests join us tonight as well.\nEPISODE LINKS:\nIndie Authors Channel - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f18fqOWghpE\n\nBlown For Good Website: http://blownforgood.com/\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website: https://www.buzzsprout.com/2131160/share\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blown-for-good-behind-the-iron-curtain-of-scientology/id1671284503\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6NZGCcRjr8jQRFrqugdfJK\nRSS: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/2131160.rss\n\nYOUTUBE PLAYLISTS:\nSpy Files Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq4cA-eBNXD1q9jD729pQmWk\n\nScientology Stories Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq5G35lu2nxviwc_XueI_Xmk\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nSOCIAL:\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/blownforgood\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/blownforgoodbook\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/blownforgood/?hl=en\n\nThe Aftermath Foundation: https://theaftermathfoundation.org\nSP Shop: https://thespshop.com\n\n#scientology #davidmiscavige #dannymasterson #truecrime #missing #shellymiscavige  #tomcruise  #scientologyandtheaftermath #lronhubbard  #miscavige #cult #ScientologyLeaks #ScientologyBeliefs #ScientologyPractices",
