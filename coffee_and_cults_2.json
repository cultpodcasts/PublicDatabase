      "description": "Diddy \u0026 Ashton Kutcher have been friends for over 20 years, \u0026 after Diddy\u0027s arrest, it seems Ashton Kutcher \u0026 his wife Mila Kunis are trying to distance themselves from any association with Diddy. Especially after the disaster filled year they just had after writing letters of support for convicted serial monster Danny Masterson. In the early 2000\u2019s, Diddy was already an a-lister, \u0026 while working on his hit show Making the Band with MTV, he met Hollywoods latest golden boy who also had a successful MTV show, Ashton Kutcher. Sean Combs \u0026 Ashton Kutcher created a fabricated story for how they met at MTV, but later in the video we\u2019ll discuss the alleged real story, as this encounter with Diddy would set up over 20 years of friendship \u0026 showed P Diddy that Ashton Kutcher, supported by his best friend Danny Masterson could keep a secret. Combs \u0026 Kutcher connected immediately, \u0026 Diddy enjoyed spending time with Kutcher so much, he started inviting him to do everything friends would do together \u0026 much more. \n\nINTRO: 00:00-00:01 00:02-03:04\nPART ONE: WHO ARE THE RAT PACK IN PRESENT DAY (CRIMES. ALLEGATIONS \u0026 LIES): 03:05-59:08\nPART TWO: THE RAT PACKS HOLLYWOOD HEY DAYS: 59:09-01:47:23\n\nIn 2003 Combs also hit it off with Kutcher\u2019s best friend Danny Masterson \u0026 combined with Kutcher and Mastersons fellow That 70\u2019s Show costar, Wilmer Valderrama, Diddy formed a group with the three That 70\u2019s Show stars \u0026 put himself at the centre, P Diddy dubbed them the new Hollywood rat pack.  In this video we\u0027ll discuss everything from the foundation of Diddy \u0026 Kutcher\u0027s relationship, their partying rat pack, business endeavours and their connections in present day.

      "description": "Twin Flames Universe is a cult lead by Jeff and Shaleia Divine (previously Jeff and Shaleia Ayan \u0026 many other names). They\u0027ve been accused of brain washing, coercion, not paying people who work for them, forcing people to transition, telling their followers to stalk and harass their \u0027twin flame\u0027 \u0026 even telling people to violate restraining orders. Jeff and Shaleia are earning millions of dollars from their followers and all of the controversies surrounding them have caused the media to investigate their activity, journalists at Vanity Fair, Vice, and several others have dove into Jeff and Shaleia and Twin Flames Universe. In recent months, there has also been two docuseries released, Netflix\u0027s Escaping Twin Flames Universe \u0026 Amazon Prime\u0027s Desperately Seeking Soulmate - Escaping Twin Flames Universe. So today we\u0027ll be going over everything to do with Twin Flames Universe \u0026 the controversy surrounding Jeff and Shaleia - alleged coercion, brain washing, forced transition, not paying their workers, attempting to move all the followers to a privately purchased plot of land with hundreds of arches and so many other things. \nNOTE: This video is the result of research and everything is alleged and based on my personal opinion.\n\nIntro 00:00-00:01 00:02-02:05\nChapter One - What is Twin Flames Universe? 02:06-08:23\nChapter Two - Who Are Jeff \u0026 Shaleia? 08:24-17:37\nChapter Three -  Coaching, Courses \u0026 Bullshit 17:38-30:25\nChapter Four - Money, Control \u0026 Dangerous Mental Health \u2019Treatment\u2019 30:26-49:00\nChapter Five - TGolden Children \u0026 Coerced Transitions 49:01-56:49\nChapter Six - Former Members Stories 56:50-01:17:02\nChapter Seven - Twin Flames Universe Today 01:17:03-01:42:37\n\nSOURCES: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pwg0B6SmPBslORJ6PP7tvGfem83AlpjnqVzWRp-F6HM/edit?usp=sharing\nSpecial thanks (links to specific videos \u0026 channels in sources) to @letthefresherin , @lescomicmaker \n\n\u2714\uFEFF Second Channel - https://www.youtube.com/@UCh3o7rJe-xT1iYoPtjU37vQ \n\u2714\uFEFF TV Review Channel - https://www.youtube.com/@UCJCNGEYpTATKX55M5P_x3Dg \n\u2714 Social Media \nAshSilverInvestigates https://www.instagram.com/ashsilverinvestigates/ - Coffee \u0026 Cults Insta\nTheAshSilver https://www.instagram.com/theashsilver/ - Main Channel Insta\nTheAshSilver https://www.twitter.com/theashsilver/\nThe.Ash.Silver https://www.facebook.com/the.ash.silver/\n\u2714 Business Email - Ash.Silver2020@gmail.com\n\n#twinflamesuniverse #documentary",

In the early seasons of the show, the Browns tried to convince their audience that polygamy worked and that they were leading happy lives. Fast forward to today, and that premise has come crashing down, with three out of the four marriages failing and Kody barely speaking to any of his children. There\u0027s a lot of drama with Sister Wives, but also a lot of questionable behaviour, from predatory MLM\u0027s, money problems, the injuries and incidents that have happened to the kids on the show and just the all around awful behaviour by Kody Brown. Today we\u0027re going to be diving in to EVERYTHING you need to know about not only the Sister Wives show, but also the lives of Kody, Meri, Christine, Janelle and Robyn Brown outside of the show. I am also sitting down with some of the most beloved Sister Wives content creators towards the end of the video, so make sure you stick around for that!

He is also is best friends with his That 70\u0027s Show costars, Ashton Kutcher \u0026 Mila Kunis. Masterson may look to be another typical Hollywood celebrity, but behind the scenes he was attacking a large amount of women, many more than you\u2019ve heard about in the mainstream media. Danny Masterson, along with his siblings Chris Masterson (Malcolm in the Middle) \u0026 Alanna Masterson (The Walking Dead), is a lifelong member of the Church of Scientology. This case has had a lot of publicity because of the celebrities attached to it but unless you have been following this trial day after day from the people who were in court and following it all extremely closely, I think you\u2019ll be surprised by what really went on. The investigation took over seven years, and Leah Remini even put out a special episode of Leah Remini: Scientology \u0026 the Aftermath, covering Masterson\u0027s attacks on multiple women. This video will go over everything about Masterson, the accusations, trial, outcome, aftermath and more.

HEAVY SUBJECT MATTER*\nWelcome to a new video, today we are talking about the rise and fall of Allison Mack. Mack went from the star of a Disney Channel movie, to the lead on one of the first superhero shows on The WB, \u0026 later The CW, to second in command of a cult, NXIVM.
