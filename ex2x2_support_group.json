      "description": "This is a recording of a WA/NID/AK staff meeting, taken on June 4th, 2024. The main voice in the beginning portion of the call is Darryl Doland, overseer of WA/NID/AK. Other voices are members of that region\u0027s ministry.\n\nThe purpose of the meeting was to address a set of proposed regional guidelines for handling CSA/SA in the fellowship. These guidelines had recently been completed by a special team which included CSA professionals, who had spent the last several months on this task in coordination with the ministry.\n\nEarly in this recording, Darryl Doland makes clear that he will not be moving forward with the guidelines. The general consensus (outside of a few voices of dissent) was that a brand new guidelines document may or may not be created - presumably by the ministry - which involves much more scripture. \n\nThe role of the Safety Team (recently formed through a multi-step process led by the ministry) remains unclear without a set of guidelines to lead them. \n\n**Redacted portions include: \n1. a worker\u0027s disclosure of a survivor\u0027s identity and story\n2. ending prayers",
