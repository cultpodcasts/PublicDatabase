      "description": "This podcast contains references to child sexual abuse.    Juliana Buhring was born into a religious cult that she says brought her up with a warped idea of love. She was separated from her mum at the age of three and ended up living in communes in more than 20 different countries. When she left the group at the age of 23, she went on to discover healthier, less exploitative ways to love. But when a crocodile took the life of the man she had fallen in love with, Juliana hatched a plan to deal with the grief and embarked on a journey that would get her into the record books. Her book about her experience is called This Road I Ride. If you\u0027ve been affected by any of the issues in the programme, you can find information about where to get help and support at Befrienders Worldwide or through the BBC Action Line.Get in touch: outlook@bbc.comPresenter: Jo Fidgen Producer: Edgar Maddicott(Photo: Juliana Buhring.

Rick started investigating, which lead him to a career as a world-renowned cult intervention specialist, or cult deprogrammer. Now, he helps people leave destructive cults or controversial groups and movements. But it\u2019s work that can be demanding, problematic and perilous \u2013 especially if interventions don\u0027t go to plan.This podcast is part of Cult Behaviour, a mini-series from Outlook exploring how a cult can manipulate a person\u2019s sense of reality, and what it can take to break free.

      "description": "In 2011, the former Dynasty actor Catherine Oxenberg and her 19-year-old daughter India took a course from the self-help organisation Nxivm (pronounced Nexium). It was a pivotal experience for India as she had been struggling to find a career and Nxivm seemed to offer her purpose. She ended up working for them as a coach and moving away from her mother. What India didn\u2019t know was that Nxivm was in fact a dangerous cult. Eventually she would be trapped in a secret subgroup, which was really a sex-trafficking ring operated by the cult leader, Keith Raniere.This episode is part of Cult Behaviour, a mini-series from Outlook exploring how a cult can manipulate a person\u2019s sense of reality, and what it can take to break free.

      "description": "Mikel Jollett started life in a California-based cult called Synanon. What began as a drug rehabilitation programme that helped his father kick a heroin addiction later turned into a cult where children were taken away from their parents at just six months old and married couples were forced to split up and take new partners. As the cult turned increasingly violent, Mikel\u2019s mother managed to escape with him and his brother, but Mikel\u2019s hardships didn\u2019t end there. For years he never spoke about his childhood. It was only later - when he discovered a love for music and formed a successful band, The Airborne Toxic Event - that he began to open up and write about those early years. Mikel\u2019s book is called Hollywood Park.Get in touch: outlook@bbc.comPresented by: Emily Webb Produced by: Patrick Kiteley and Andrea RangecroftPicture: Mikel Jollett performs with The Airborne Toxic Event in 2015  Credit: Andrew Benge/Redferns via Getty Images",
