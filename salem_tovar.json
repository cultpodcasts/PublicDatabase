In today\u0027s video we will be doing a deep dive and deep analysis of the very short-lived yet chaotic Tiktok cult children of the waning star started by tiktok creator Gigi Jarvis who also happens to be a model, actress and a scholar who has literally studied in sociology, power dynamics \u0026 so much more classes that set off all types of alarms. From telling her followers she wants to be a cult leader, telling them what to call themselves, choosing emojis to represent them, to saying she\u0027ll break into their homes if they don\u0027t obey, this tiktok children of the waning star cult quickly went from a community joke to something extremely dark really fast. But this is so much more than just a tiktok trend gone bad, it really shows us the power of social media, the romanization of cults and how easy it is to take advantage of people who lack 3rd spaces via para-social relationships online and making cults seem like something quirky and cute- instead of what they really are: scary, controlling and straight up wrong. And I\u0027m here to give all the details, let\u0027s get into this! \n\nSubscribe: https://s71.co/3rZoTir | Make sure to enable ALL push notifications! \nWatch the latest videos: https://s71.co/3gcY5pv \n\nWatch More Salem Tovar:\nReal Talk:  https://s71.co/3B4HrlD \nCommentary:  https://s71.co/34lP5vr \nMost Popular: https://s71.co/3uhIDAx \n\nFollow Salem Tovar:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_salemtovar_/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@salemtovar\n\nAbout Salem: Hey!
