Head to https://growtherapy.yt.link/olZZWFl to find your estimate and get started today! In today\u0027s video I\u0027m finally deep diving into my cult-like upbringing- from people rolling on the floor during service, to sermons about the end times every other sunday. I have so many stories about being in a cult for basically the first 16 years of my life. In this video I specifically talk about when my church thought I was demon possessed and tried exercising me mid-service in front of the whole congregation, of course all while doing my makeup to distract from the trauma of course lol. Let\u0027s get into this crazy storytime and get ready with me! \n\nSubscribe: https://s71.co/3rZoTir | Make sure to enable ALL push notifications! \nWatch the latest videos: https://s71.co/3gcY5pv \n\nWatch More Salem Tovar:\nReal Talk:  https://s71.co/3B4HrlD \nCommentary:  https://s71.co/34lP5vr \nMost Popular: https://s71.co/3uhIDAx \n\nFollow Salem Tovar:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_salemtovar_/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@salemtovar\n\nAbout Salem: Hey!

In today\u0027s video we will be doing a deep dive and deep analysis of the very short-lived yet chaotic Tiktok cult children of the waning star started by tiktok creator Gigi Jarvis who also happens to be a model, actress and a scholar who has literally studied in sociology, power dynamics \u0026 so much more classes that set off all types of alarms. From telling her followers she wants to be a cult leader, telling them what to call themselves, choosing emojis to represent them, to saying she\u0027ll break into their homes if they don\u0027t obey, this tiktok children of the waning star cult quickly went from a community joke to something extremely dark really fast. But this is so much more than just a tiktok trend gone bad, it really shows us the power of social media, the romanization of cults and how easy it is to take advantage of people who lack 3rd spaces via para-social relationships online and making cults seem like something quirky and cute- instead of what they really are: scary, controlling and straight up wrong. And I\u0027m here to give all the details, let\u0027s get into this! \n\nSubscribe: https://s71.co/3rZoTir | Make sure to enable ALL push notifications! \nWatch the latest videos: https://s71.co/3gcY5pv \n\nWatch More Salem Tovar:\nReal Talk:  https://s71.co/3B4HrlD \nCommentary:  https://s71.co/34lP5vr \nMost Popular: https://s71.co/3uhIDAx \n\nFollow Salem Tovar:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_salemtovar_/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@salemtovar\n\nAbout Salem: Hey!

      "description": "Big TikTok Families Like \u0022TheCollins\u0022 Say It\u2019s a Sin To Not Have 12 Kids- Because They\u2019re In A Cult...In Todays video we will be deep diving into the cult like world of religious big influencer families and the indoctrination people like Karissa Collins spread on Instagram and tiktok. The Cult of romanticizing having big families needs to stop- especially if religion has a role in it. From overly religious big family influencers like Ballerina Farm, Nara Smith to Karissa Collins- they all play a role in a much bigger idea- the idea that if you don\u0027t make bread from home, have 12 kids and preach extremist religious views, that you\u0027re not holy enough. Such as the Collinsfamily mother Karissa Collins forcing her family to make toxic tiktoks repeating this indoctronation. The truth is that these family \u0022holy\u0022 channels, tikoks and content creators are far from holy, it more so seems like neglect, extremism and at this point a cult!

I grew up in a cult, and this is my story why choosing to either to stay or leave this world- is a difficult one. \n\nWatch More Salem Tovar:\nReal Talk:  https://s71.co/3B4HrlD \nCommentary:  https://s71.co/34lP5vr \nMost Popular: https://s71.co/3uhIDAx \n\nFollow Salem Tovar:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_salemtovar_/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@salemtovar\n\nAbout Salem: Hey!
