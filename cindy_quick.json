      "description": "I forgot to share this in the video:\n\nWhen talking with some friends about what this pain is like, I thought of the analogy of needing to have a limb amputated. Of course, no one ever wants to willingly remove a limb, but if that limb somehow becomes damage, injured, infected beyond recovery - if keeping that limb threatens your well-being or ability to carry on a normal sustainable life - unfortunately, you know the wisest course is to surrender the limb. \nEven after doing so, you will have \u0022false pain\u0022 where that limb once was. You\u0027ll have memories of what life was like when you had the limb. Good \u0026 bad. Perhaps you\u0027ll wonder if you made the wrong decision \u0026 \u0027maybe if you just waited longer the limb could\u0027ve gotten better, or you could\u0027ve learned to live with it despite the struggle you would have had for the rest of your life.\u0027\nBut then you think of how healthy you are now, everything you\u0027re still able to do \u0026 even things you were never able to do before that you have strength to do now... Maybe you have a high-performing prosthetic \u0026 most people don\u0027t even notice there\u0027s anything abnormal about you unless you tell them.. \n\nThis is what it\u0027s like to lose loved ones to the org of JWs .. It\u0027s painful \u0026 we will miss them \u0026 memories will continue to resurface, but we can become stronger \u0026 healthier \u0026 happier despite the loss. \u2764",

(Ps. 33:5) We can be sure that our God loves us dearly and wants us to be treated fairly. This becomes evident when we look closely at the Law that Jehovah gave to the nation of Israel through Moses.
