      "description": "IN RECENT weeks we have seen some anti-aslyum seeker protests take place across the country, with far-right groups and beliefs seeming to take a more mainstream place in Irish culture in recent times.On today\u2019s podcast we\u2019ll focus on how some beliefs associated with far-right thinking may be closer to home in West Cork than you would imagine, and have been for some time now.The Southern Star\u0027s editor, Siobh\u00E1n Cronin, joins us to speak about her visit to Auschwitz and a recent court case involving a human rights activist and the SSPX Resistance - a fringe religious group which broke away from mainstream Catholicism over its belief that the modern Church has become too liberal.Thanks for watching and listening to\u00A0The Southern Star\u0027s\u00A0In The News podcast.
