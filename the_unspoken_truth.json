Introduced to a cult by her own father, her life took a devastating turn, and by the age of 14, she was taken into care.\n\nThis conversation is not about exposing a cult for shock value. It\u2019s about the lasting impact of psychological control, growing up without safety, and the difficult journey of rebuilding identity after leaving everything you were taught to believe.\n\nShe opens up about trust, survival, and what it truly means to find your voice after years of silence.\n\nRaw.
