      "title": "Prosecutor Praises Victims\u2019 Courage After NXIVM Leader Keith Raniere Sentenced",
      "description": "Disgraced self-improvement guru Keith Raniere, whose NXIVM followers included millionaires and Hollywood actors, was sentenced to 120 years on Tuesday for turning some adherents into sex slaves branded with his initials.\n\nU.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis handed down the sentence in federal court in Brooklyn after a lengthy hearing featuring statements by victims of a sex-trafficking conspiracy that resulted in Raniere\u2019s conviction last year.\n\nProsecutors had sought life in prison while defense lawyers said he should face 15 years behind bars.\n\nRaniere, 60, had shown no remorse, with his lawyers telling the judge before the sentencing that their client wasn\u2019t sorry \u201Cfor his conduct or his choices.\u201D\n\nThe sentencing culminated several years of revelations about Raniere\u2019s program, NXIVM, which charged thousands of dollars for invitation-only self improvement courses at its headquarters near Albany, New York, along with branches in Mexico and Canada. Adherents included millionaires and Hollywood actresses willing to endure humiliation and pledge obedience to the defendant as part of his teachings.\n\nNXIVM has been the subject of two TV documentary series this year, HBO\u2019s \u201CThe Vow,\u201D and the Starz series \u201CSeduced: Inside the NXIVM Cult.\u201D\n\nProsecutors said Raniere led what amounted to a criminal enterprise, inducing shame and guilt to influence and control co-conspirators who helped recruit and groom sexual partners for Raniere. He was convicted on charges including racketeering, alien smuggling, sex trafficking, extortion and obstruction of justice.\n\nThey said that among other crimes, Raniere began a sexual relationship in 2005 with a 15-year-old girl and confined another teenager to a room for nearly two years.\n\nRaniere had come under harsh attack on Tuesday from former followers during sentencing in his sex-trafficking case.\n\nIndia Oxenberg, the daughter of \u201CDynasty\u201D actress Catherine Oxenberg, called him an \u201Centitled little princess\u201D and a sexual predator and lamented that she \u201Cmay have to spend the rest of my life with Keith Raneire\u2019s initials seared into me.\u201D\n\nThe likelihood of leniency had seemed to dissipate with the recent sentencing of Clare Bronfman, 41, an heir to the Seagram\u2019s liquor fortune, for her role in what has been described by some ex-members as a cult. Bronfman was sentenced to nearly seven years in prison. Prosecutors had only sought five years.\n\nEx-followers told the judge that Bronfman for years had used her wealth to try to silence NXIVM defectors.\n\nReniere\u2019s followers called him \u201CVanguard.\u201D To honor him, the group formed a secret sorority comprised of female \u201Cslaves\u201D who were branded with his initials and ordered to have sex with him, the prosecutors said. Women were also pressured into giving up embarrassing information about themselves that could be used against them if they left the group.\n\nAlong with Bronfman, Raniere\u2019s teachings won him the devotion of Hollywood actors including Allison Mack of TV\u2019s \u201CSmallville.\u201D Mack also has pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing.\n\nIn a sentencing submission, lawyers for Reniere said he \u201Ccontinues to assert his complete innocence to these charges.\u201D\n\nThey wrote that his jury conviction at an unfair trial resulted from a media campaign involving witnesses who were motivated to testify falsely as part of a \u201Cheavy-handed prosecution that threatened potential defense witnesses.\u201D\n\nHis lawyers said the life prison term prosecutors sought was excessive.\n\n\u201CNo one was shot, stabbed, punched, kicked, slapped or even yelled at,\u201D they said. \u201CDespite the sex offenses, there is no evidence that any woman ever told Keith Raniere that she did not want to kiss him, touch him, hold his hand or have sex with him.\u201D\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8Gm\n\nQUICKTAKE ON SOCIAL:\nFollow QuickTake on Twitter: twitter.com/quicktake\nLike QuickTake on Facebook: facebook.com/quicktake\nFollow QuickTake on Instagram: instagram.com/quicktake\nSubscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/2FJ0oQZ\nEmail us at quicktakenews@gmail.com\n\nQuickTake by Bloomberg is a global news network delivering up-to-the-minute analysis on the biggest news, trends and ideas for a new generation of leaders.",
