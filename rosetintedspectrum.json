      "title": "From Cult to Game Developer: The Story of St. Brides \u0026 The Silver Sisterhood Documentary",
      "description": "Taking a dive into the murky waters of St. Brides, the kinky boarding school which grew from a feminist cult which took over from a bunch of people screaming in a garden. This is the tale of a very strange development house, making games that really couldn\u0027t have been made at any other time. This is the story of St. Brides, and it\u0027s a very, very weird one.\n\nWant To Support The Channel?
