      "description": "After witnessing a lot of \u0022spiritual\u0022 cults in Los Angeles, I finally share my experiences and how to spot the signs early on to avoid getting sucked in. \n\nThis is especially true for my filmmakers, writers, actors, and artists who moved to or want to move to LA without knowing the areas, the industry, etc. \n\nIf you\u0027re an aspiring filmmaker, screenwriter, or actor, or if you dream about being a part of the entertainment world, this podcast exposes the reality of what that REALLY means. \n\nJoin me as I reflect on unexpected lessons I learned throughout my career in Los Angeles as a screenwriter!",
