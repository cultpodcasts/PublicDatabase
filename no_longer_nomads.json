      "description": "In this gripping second part of *The Lindsay Tornambe Story*, host Josh Doyle continues the conversation with Lindsay as she recounts her decade trapped inside a religious cult led by Victor Barnard \u2014 a man who twisted Scripture, manipulated young women, and convinced families to surrender their daughters in the name of \u201Cfaith.\u201D\n\nLindsay opens up about life as one of \u201CVictor\u2019s maidens,\u201D the brainwashing, emotional abuse, and horrifying control that kept her captive for years. From forced servitude and psychological torment to the moment she began to see the truth, this episode dives deep into what it took for her to break free, confront the lies, and help bring justice to the man who destroyed so many lives.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a story about surviving abuse \u2014 it\u2019s a story about redemption, courage, and finding faith on the other side of trauma.\n\n\u26A0\uFE0F Content Warning: This episode contains discussion of child abuse, cult manipulation, and sexual assault.

      "title": "She Exposed the Cult That Controlled Her Family (Part 1) | Lindsay Tornambe | Ep. 57",
      "description": "At just 11 years old, Lindsay Tornambe\u2019s family left Pennsylvania for what they thought was a Bible-based camp in rural Minnesota. But the \u201Ccamp\u201D was actually the home of a self-proclaimed prophet named Victor, whose control and manipulation would lead to years of trauma, spiritual abuse, and fear.\n\nIn this episode of No Longer Nomads, host Josh Doyle and his brother Tommy sit down with Lindsay to hear how she was given away as a \u201Cmaiden\u201D at just 12 years old\u2014and how she found the strength to escape, expose the truth, and rebuild her life in faith and freedom.\n\nThis is one of the most powerful and harrowing survivor stories we\u2019ve ever shared. Lindsay\u2019s courage, honesty, and deep belief in God will move you, challenge you, and remind you of the power of redemption.\n\n\u26A0\uFE0F Content Warning: This episode contains discussion of child abuse, cult manipulation, and sexual assault.
