      "description": "Dear Scientology Child,\r\n\r\nWe are sorry. We didn\u0027t know any better at the time. We failed you. There is no justification for what you have gone through, there is no Overts and Withhold list that can make things better, no Lower Conditions that can change the past. \r\n\r\nThese messages are for you.\r\n\r\n\u0022As for me, and my children: they are both dead. Enforced abortion. I was married at the time. There was no real reason to abort. I did it for the Sea Org. So I could stay. \r\n\r\nI would have a 14 year old and a 6 year old now.\u0022\r\n\r\n\u0022After I got declared she got hounded by the Org to disconnect from me - she works for a Scn run company and all of her friends where \u0022in\u0022. So, she lied and said she disconnected. She lies to the company she works for when she comes to visit me. She doesn\u0027t keep my address in her cell phone or in her house, in case one of her churchy friends gets nosy and finds it. She still has a few churchy friends and still works for a Scn run company, but she\u0027s slowly getting away from all of that.\u0022\r\n\r\n\u0022I would like to apologise to my four children.\r\n\r\nTo my eldest for my not being strong enough to be your real \u0022Mum\u0022 and for being pressured into staying on staff instead.\r\n\r\nTo you all I apologise for all the times I did not really hear you. For the times I translated your words into the language of Scientology instead of really hearing what you said.\r\n\r\nFor the times I did not see you, seeing instead \u0022big thetans in little bodies\u0022 instead of the child you were, who needed unconditional love.\r\n\r\nFor the times I was not there when you needed me as I tried to save the world elsewhere.\r\n\r\nFor not keeping you safe from the influences that led to conflicting views on drugs, authority and approval, (you will know what I mean.)\r\n\r\nFor subjecting (some of) you to the chaos of the Scientology school as it was established and those gut wrenching times.\r\n\r\nYou are all terrific and no matter any differences of opinion we may have, I love you.\u0022\r\n\r\n\u0022There is a lot I would like to say about my children who endured the Sea Org for 12 and 13 yrs of their lives.\r\n\r\nIt took me three years to get them out after I myself left - three years of fear and threats and lies. I\u0027m only sorry I didn\u0027t succeed when I originally left. I could have stopped the cadet org abuse from ever occurring.\r\n\r\nI found out after my children had grown how they were beaten and sexually abused while in the Cadet org. I wish I had known. \r\n\r\nFor everything that happened to them - at the beach when they were forcefully taken from me - to their stint in the Cadet org in PAC I am so truly sorry. They won\u0027t talk about that time in their lives. I don\u0027t blame them.\r\n\r\nI won\u0027t go into details - many things happened and many are bad. They are free and they are living their lives happily now.\r\n\r\nFor that I thank God!\r\n\r\nOzzie\u0022\r\n\r\n\u0022My Son, I am sorry for the neglect I subjected you to while I was on staff. You deserved my love and care, instead you received ethics handlings and fear. Please forgive me.\u0022\r\n\r\n\u0022I was going through a very serious crisis, and concerned that I might be dangerous to myself and others, and the Church fed this idea by declaring me a \u0022Suppressive Person\u0022. I was compliant with this, and decided it would be best for you if I left, and if I didn\u0027t insinuate myself into your lives. I thought it would be best for you if I cut the cord... \r\nNitza, I recently watched the movie \u0022Hard Problems\u0022, and it was wonderful to see you again, even if through a movie camera. \r\nZeb, I\u0027m very proud of you for your success, and glad to see that you have remained the person I remember so well from your early years, although you\u0027ve obviously grown a lot and deepened into the man you\u0027re becoming.\r\nGabby, what can I say. A daughter is famously the apple of a father\u0027s eye, and you are no exception, for me.\r\nI am very sorry for my poor judgment being involved with that Church, and words cannot express how sorry I am that you paid the price for my ignorance and poor judgment when I was a teen parent.\r\nKevin G. Brady\u0022\r\n\r\n\u0022My children suffered at great lengths at the hands of their Scientology Step-dad. He molested them and justified it by saying they were \u0022old souls\u0022 and were responsible for their own condition. My youngest was 3 years old. The Church of Scientology did not want me to turn him in...... He gets out in 5 years after nearly doing 20 years. Somehow it is just not long enough.\u0022\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Scientology Child,\r\nWe are here for you now.\r\nWe will not forget.\r\nWe are many.\r\nWe are expecting you. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.enturbulation.org/\r\n\r\nVid by\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/Voiceless8C",

People deemed to have hidden evil intentions (detected by the E-meter).\r\n2. People who were unproductive and scored poorly on the personality test.\r\n3. Repeated \u0022stat crashers\u0022 (people who were held responsible for declines in Scientology organizations\u0027 productivity)\r\n4. \u0022Overt product makers\u0022 (people who produced poor-quality work).\r\n5. People who spoke against any member of the church or church activity (declared a Suppressive Person).\r\n\r\nIn the RPF you are held AGAINST YOUR WILL for months or even years. There is no release until you are declared \u0022REDEEMED\u0022. If you are committed to an RPF late in your life, you might just die there (and be CREMATED before your family are informed of your death). \r\nYou will UNDERGO HARD LABOUR to- and beyond -- exhaustion. YOU HAVE TO RUN EVERYWHERE (WHILST CARRYING HEAVY WEIGHTS). You will be ordered to perform BIZARRE PHYSICAL TASKS, such as carrying buckets filled with sand up and down a ladder. You wear a PRISON UNIFORM to identify you as a CRIMINAL and to DEMEAN YOU. In the RPF you are FORBIDDEN ANY CONTACT WITH YOUR SPOUSE AND CHILDREN. In addition, whilst in the RPF, you are YOU ARE BILLED FOR EVERY SINGLE DAY YOU SPEND IN INCARCERATION AND FOR EVERY COURSE OF TREATMENT YOU RECEIVE.\r\n\r\nThese facts were confirmed in an investigative article in the LOS ANGELES TIMES (\u0022In interviews and public records, former staff and inmates have said they were alienated from society, stripped of familiar beliefs, punished for aberrant behaviour, rewarded for conformity (brain-washing), and worked beyond exhaustion.\u0022 (June 26, 1990, p. A16). \u0022RPF\u0027ers as they are called, are separated from their family and friends for months or years. They cannot speak unless spoken to, they run wherever they go and they wear armbands to denote their lowly condition.\u0022 They are expected to do very menial jobs and hard labour or whatever the management \u0022deem necessary for redemption.\u0022\r\n\r\nConfinement in the RPF is not restricted to adults. CHILDREN WHO MISBEHAVE can be TAKEN FROM THEIR PARENTS and confined to the RPF.\r\n\r\nReports of abuse are common. TAX THE CULT\r\n\r\nvid by\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/UnethicalBehaviour",

      "description": "This is a message for those still inside Scientology.\r\n\r\nYou are not the only Scientologist with doubts about how Scientology is kept working by those that have placed themselves in control of both its policies, and its tech. These doubts are justified even though they \r\nare not being addressed, or are being excused by those around you. \r\nMany are discouraged from applying KSW themselves, and the tech as it is now, is more squirreled than ever before.\r\n\r\nNow, ask yourself why you got into Scientology in the first place and what you were hoping to accomplish.\r\nThen ask yourself if you have ever accomplished those things within Scientology or by using its tech.\r\nThe answer to that for many people is that it has not.\r\n\r\nLeaving Scientology is not easy, nobody will tell you that it is. \r\nBut there are more people available to help you do it than ever before, and many of those that have left did not have the resources you have available today.\r\n\r\nYou are never alone. \r\n\r\nGreg and Debra Barnes have left,\r\n\r\nYou can too.\r\n\r\nAstra Woodcraft has left,\r\n\r\nYou can too.\r\n\r\nJenna Miscavige Hill has left,\r\n\r\nYou can too.\r\n\r\nLisa Goodman has left,\r\n\r\nYou can too.\r\n\r\nMichael Pattinson has left,\r\n\r\nYou can too.\r\n\r\nPatty Pieniadz has left,\r\n\r\nYou can too.\r\n\r\nJeff Hawkins has left,\r\n\r\nYou can too.\r\n\r\nMarc Headley has left,\r\n\r\nYou can too.\r\n\r\nLawrence Brennan has left,\r\n\r\nYou can too.\r\n\r\nMike Rinder has left,\r\n\r\nYou can too.\r\n\r\nJason Beghe has left,\r\n\r\nYou can too.

      "description": "The Anonymous Coalition calls for an Uprising by Victims against Scientology.\r\n\r\nText:\r\nHello, to the tens of thousands of victims of Scientology:\r\nWe, the Anonymous Coalition to dismantle Scientology, wish to offer you the opportunity to join the popular worldwide uprising, against the infamous, criminal organization of Scientology. \r\nWe recognize the long and often enforced, silent suffering of the countless victims of this dangerous cult \r\nMany of you have been ruined financially. Many have been physically hurt or emotionally scarred. Almost all of you have been shuddered into silence by the OSA, the terrorist wing of Scientology. The fear of the Fair Game policy of Scientology, still relentlessly enforced, has kept many of you silent, all these years. \r\nFor many of you, the hope of contact with relatives or friends, cruelly separated from you, by Scientology\u0027s Disconnection Policy, has kept you silent or afraid. For many others, the trauma of your abuse, condoned and often directed by Scientology, either as an adult, or worse, as a child, has made you reluctant to speak out. \r\nMany are still fearful of Scientology\u0027s relentless attacks, against any vocal defectors and detractors.\r\nThe Anonymous demonstrations we have recently held, have expressed our concern for your suffering. We have determined to deconstruct Scientology\u0027s faulty institutions and end its inhumane policies. This will forever end the creation of more victims of Scientology\u0027s cruel and unusual punishments. This will also release, from within the dark recesses of the Scientology structure, the many lost, and wounded, the public does not see. \r\nWe seek the release of the minds and bodies of your loved ones, and others, who are kept prisoner, by invisible chains of fear, dependence and injustice, as well as those imprisoned, behind real razor wire and constant surveillance.\r\nWe offer you the chance to safely join, hour uprising against the current real, present, arrogant and oppressive tyranny of Scientology. \r\nHelp us to end the reign of terror of Scientology, over its staff, public members, ex members, their families, and any one whom they declare an enemy, to be lied to, tricked and, destroyed.\r\nRise up and peacefully express your real more all outrage, behind the safety of Anonymity, or Group numbers, or both. \r\nMany of your fellow sufferers have already seized the opportunity, or have heeded hour call, or joined the resistance from even before hour beginnings. Even some of the children, who survived and escaped Scientology\u0027s heartless grasp, are beginning to speak out.\r\nWe call upon any and all of the victims of Scientology, to no longer feel shackled by the fear of Scientology Retribution, to join us at the next demonstration, and all that follow. With our growing numbers, we shall be able to strengthen the political will of our public servants, to enforce the existing laws, and destroy the social cancer and financial predator, that is known, as the Church of Scientology.\r\n\r\nWe offer the silent, their missing voice.\r\nThe powerless, their forgotten strength. \r\nThe oppressed, their lost expression. \r\nThe isolated, their missing con solation. \r\nThe imprisoned, their freedom.\r\nAnd for the disconnected, the opportunity to Reconnect.\r\nJoin us, and, if you wish, demand your human rights.\r\nThe leadership of Scientology knows: \r\nWe do not forgive.\r\nWe do not forget.\r\nWe will not stop.\r\nWe are, the Legion of Legions.\r\nExpect us.\r\nExpect all of us.\r\nForever. \r\nhttp://www.xenu.net/",

      "description": "Full transcript, references and higher quality wmv video file available at: http://www.vimeo.com/1078519\r\n(download link is near the bottom of the vimeo page)\r\nFeel free to re-upload.\r\n\r\nYou may be surprised to learn that in America, one group enjoys a tax-exemption and special privileges from the IRS, privileges that go beyond those afforded to any other taxpayer.\r\n\r\nAlso surprising is the fact that for over 25 years, the IRS fought against this group in the courts, arguing that it did not qualify for any tax-exemption due to \u0022the commercial character\u0022 of much of the groups operations, and its \u0022virtually incomprehensible financial procedures\u0022.\r\n\r\nIn 1991, an unusual meeting was held between the leader of the group (David Miscavige) and the IRS Commissioner (Fred T. Goldberg Jr.).\r\nA complete reversal of the IRS\u0027 position came into effect in October 1993.\r\n\r\nA secret deal now provides this group with rights that exceed those of the average citizen.\r\n\r\nThis group and its associated corporations are known by various names, including: \r\nChurch of Scientology International \r\nChurch of Spiritual Technology \r\nReligious Technology Center\r\n\r\nFront Groups include:\r\nApplied Scholastics\r\nNarconon\r\nCriminon\r\nCitizen\u0027s Commission on Human Rights\r\n\r\nA New York Times investigation revealed that Scientology\u0027s tax exemption \u0022followed a series of unusual internal IRS actions that came after an extraordinary campaign orchestrated by Scientology against the agency and people who work there.\u0022\r\n\r\nScientologists are able to claim tax-deductions of a nature that is prohibited for members of any other group...\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Constitution upholds the principle of the separation of Church and State. The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment ensures Government policy remains neutral towards religious groups. According to the Constitution, one religious group should not receive special treatment by the U.S. Government.\r\n\r\nOn February 4, 2008, Judge Kim Wardlaw summarized the situation:\r\n\r\n\u0022The view of the IRS is that it can unconstitutionally violate the Constitution by establishing religion, by treating one religion more favorably than other religions in terms of what it allows as deductions, and there can never be any judicial review of that?\u0022\r\n\r\n\u0022This does intrude into the Establishment Clause. The whole point is Government neutrality towards religion, and that\u0027s exactly what the IRS is not doing here\u0022\r\n\r\nThe affidavit of Lawrence H. Brennan, filed on May 6, 2008 reveals that Scientology corporations deliberately worked to create the appearance of a religious group in order to gain a tax-exemption and hide its assets from outsiders. \r\n\r\nIf you feel that Scientology\u0027s secret deal with the IRS is an injustice to American taxpayers, please write to your Congressman, and inform others about this unacceptable situation.",

      "description": "On November 18, 1995, Lisa mcpherson was involved in a minor car accident. She was apparently not hurt, but she got out of her car and took all her clothes off and seemed mentally unstable. She was taken to a hospital where she was physically evaluated as being unharmed, but the hospital wanted her to be psychologically cared for. However, some Scientologists arrived and stated that Lisa did not believe in psychiatry, and she checked out after a short evaluation and left with the Scientologists. She went with them to Room 174 of the Ft. Harrison Hotel for \u0022rest and relaxation\u0022 according to the church, but church logs from Lisa\u0027s stay there  from November 18 to her death December 5 show differently. Some logs are missing, and a high ranking ex-Scientologist has written an affidavit in which he claims that the church has in the past destroyed documents that might get the church in trouble.

Wearing what some might call Halloween masks \u0022Anonymous\u0022 protesters lined south 68th street in front of the strip mall where Milwaukee\u0027s church of Scientology is located. \r\n\r\nEvery month since February protest like this one in Milwaukee have taken place simultaneously around the globe against the Church Of Scientology and each month there\u0027s a different theme. The group says the Fair Game Policy is the harsh way Scientology treats it\u0027s detractors. \r\n\r\nWe tried to reach local Scientology officials tonight for comment about fair game but no one was available. Meanwhile the protestors say the church has a long history of so called fairgaming critics like the woman who wrote an Anti-Scientology book. \r\n\r\nThe protesers say that\u0027s why they have to remain anonymous. \r\n\r\n\u0022Anonymous\u0022 says they\u0027ll keep coming back every month.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.whyweprotest.net/\r\nhttp://www.whyaretheydead.net/\r\nhttp://www.goanonymous.org/\r\nhttp://www.youfoundthecard.com/\r\nhttp://www.taxexemptchildabuse.net/\r\nhttp://www.exscientologykids.com/\r\nhttp://www.xenu.net/\r\nhttp://www.enturbulation.org/",

You have turned your back on it.\r\nNow, after years of silence and silencing, we have broken down the gates,\r\nadvancing and stomping over your backs.\r\n\r\nThis you still fail to understand.\r\nYou still fail to understand that it was you who brought us upon yourself.\r\nYou still fail to understand that we can not be destroyed by your lies.\r\nYou still fail to understand drowning our voices with music does not drown reality.\r\nYou still fail to understand that we do not fear your troll accounts and silly advertising, your O.S.A blogs and so- called informative websites. For none of these things contain the one most most powerful weapon of all:\r\n\r\nTruth.\r\n\r\nIt is nothing but more of your bullbaiting, more laughable attempts of intimidation.\r\n\r\nYou know the rules scientology, and so do we. We knew the game and we played it.\r\nAnd we have now decided that we have gotten sick of your \u0022Fair Game\u0022 policy.\r\nOver ninethousand times you will fail. It\u0027s game over, Scientology.\r\nYour pretty empire took so long to build. Now, with a snap of history\u0027s fingers...\r\n...down it goes.\r\n\r\nOn may 10th, the fourth wave of global protests will be coming your way.\r\n\r\nYou simply can not survive the age of information.\r\n\r\nKnowledge is free.\r\nwe are Anonymous.\r\nwe are legion.\r\nwe do not forgive.\r\nwe do not forget.\r\nexpect us.",

The CoS had set up their Flag operations under \u0022Operation Normandy\u0022 in the Fort Harrison Hotel in 1975 and since, Clearwater has become a mecca for over 8,000 of Scientology\u0027s cultish goons and lavish home to celebrity space cadet and Celebrity Center dupe, Lisa Marie Presley. \r\n\r\nOver the week of those hearings, the local public station televised the proceedings and the denizens of Clearwater were glued to their sets in horror as evidence of CoS crimes and misconduct came to light, which subsequently rallied the residents in a demonstration of protest against the \u0022church\u0022\u0027s overtaking of the city, filling a nearby stadium.\r\n\r\nNo State or Federal agencies came to the aid of Clearwater during those hearings, and subsequently, the people of that quiet city unwittingly surrendered Clearwater to the Cult of Scientology.\r\n\r\nThis video is Paulette Cooper\u0027s sworn testimony before the Clearwater City Council Hearings that week.

I am writing this in attempt to appeal to the folks out there who are mislead about Scientology.\r\nThis is for those of you who feel that Scientology is harmless. If you feel that they are a religion that just needs to be left alone. For those of you who think that people who are Scientologists are just idiots. \r\nLet me ask you this:\r\nHave you ever been physically abused?\r\nHave you ever been mentally abused?\r\nHave you ever been sexually abused?\r\nHave you ever been emotionally abused?\r\nWell I have. All of the above. No, I have never been incarcerated in a prison. No I did not grow up in some 3rd world country. I grew up right here in the grand old United States of America. I had the misfortune of being born into the cult of Scientology. I never stood a chance. \r\n\r\nBy the age of 5 I was receiving regular sessions. If you don\u0027t know what a Scientology auditing session is, google it. I was in a courseroom studying Hubbard\u0027s materials by age 7. At the age of 12 I was removed from school and placed in a courseroom full time studying Hubbard\u0027s materials. By the ripe age of 13 I was recruited into the Sea Org. It was then that my life turned into a living hell. \r\n\r\nI bore witness to countless atrocities. I was the victim of quite a few myself. I will not go into great detail now because I still do not want to let the cult know who I am. I am not prepared to become another victim of \u0022Fair Game\u0022. I have suffered enough at the hands of the cult and I am not willing to suffer anymore for now. \r\n\r\nI will say this, the enforced abortions really do occur. The days on end with no sleep do occur. The withholding of food does occur. The disconnection policy is still very much in effect as is the fair game policy. The screaming, name-calling and degrading happens daily. I cannot even begin to count the number of cases of sexual abuse that have occurred in the cult with no consequence to the offenders. On the contrary, if you have been abused it is the cult\u0027s belief that you must have done something to deserve it. You will then be punished accordingly. The mental mindfuck occurs in Scientology\u0027s auditing rooms. Children of the cult are horribly exploited as are the adults. \r\n\r\nThere is another policy not as well known because it was written only for Sea Org members -- if you are an outspoken critic of Scientology then you MUST have crimes. Anyone who vocalizes their feelings against Scientology is said to be a \u0022baby-rapist\u0022 a murderer, wife-beater etc. You are taught to yell these accusations at any critic you may encounter.\r\n\r\nPeople who are \u0022willing\u0022 members of the cult are not truly willing. They are in fact under the influence of mind control. I would say at least 75% of the members have no clue about Xenu. They have not reached the level at which that information is disclosed. They are taught that receiving that knowledge prematurely can very well kill them or at the very least make them very ill. It sounds absurd but it is true. Yes, people actually believe this because when you are brainwashed you will believe just about anything. \r\n\r\nThe real shock for those of you out there who are still skeptical about whether Scientology is a cult or whether it is doing anything wrong will come when you google OT 8. Read about how Hubbard believed that Jesus was a pedophile. Read about how Hubbard believed that the coming of Lucifer will be good.\r\n\r\nI am not part of Anonymous. I am not part of any group because frankly, these days the thought of being in a group is quite nauseating to me. You could say I have had some bad experiences being a member of a group. \r\n\r\nI urge you though -- if you can stomach stepping up to bat for victims like me (there are countless thousands) please do. Get out there for the protests. Write to your government officials. Spread the word. I implore you -- do it for those of us who cannot. Help us get back on our feet. Help bring down the cult of Scientology. Help take part in making history. \r\nPlease help to make this world a better place. \r\nThank you.\u0022",
