      "description": "The Koreshan Unity cult is NOT the infamous Waco commune the FBI barbecued in the 90s. Rather, it\u0027s a turn-of-the-century Florida cult founded by a man who so badly electrocuted himself that he woke up thinking he was Jesus. It turns out that Cyrus Teed was not the Messiah, but his incredibly whacky teachings sure did intrigue David Koresh, who would go on to take quite a bit of inspiration from this random and fringe historical figure.

      "description": "The Agapemonites were a Victorian religious cult that checked all the boxes. A leader who thought he was God and also immortal and needed multiple wives? Check, check, and check. A way to separate idiots from their money and possessions? Check. A creepy compound with high walls? Check. But even for a relatively early modern cult Henry Prince and his followers found some fun (see: horrible) ways to make their mark on the history of cults.\n\nSubscribe to the Softcore History Patreon for hundreds of hours of extra history content including listener history questions, history movie watch-alongs, and weekly bonus episodes.\n\nGo to GhostBed.com/drinkinbros and use code DRINKINBROS for 50% off EVERYTHING (Mattresses, Adjustable Base, Pillows \u0026 More) \u2013plus a 101 Night Sleep Trial and Mattresses Made in America.\n\nHead to FACTORMEALS.com/softcore50 and use code softcore50 to get 50% off.\u00A0\n\nRob Fox\u00A0\nhttps://www.instagram.com/robfoxthree/\nhttps://twitter.com/RobFoxThree\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@robfoxthree\n\u00A0\nDan Regester \nhttps://www.instagram.com/danregester/\nhttps://twitter.com/dan_regester \n\nJake Goldman \nhttps://www.instagram.com/jakewgoldman/\nhttps://twitter.com/JakeWGoldman",
