      "description": "As part of his research on Shincheonji, Simon traveled to Korea, where he was able to speak with both founding members and former high-ranking members of the religious movement. His investigations led to significant revelations, including explosive details about the private life of the leader Lee Man-Hee.\n\nIn this second conversation with Mike Malke, Bible teacher and apologist for the Syrian Orthodox Church, Simon provides deep insights into the hidden world of Shincheonji. The interview sheds light on the systematic control and surveillance of followers, as well as its destructive effects on those affected and their families.\n\nIn addition, the conversation reveals previously unknown aspects, in particular the shocking truth about the cult leader and his abuse of the cult for the sexual exploitation of young women.",
