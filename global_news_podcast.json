      "description": "Photos of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew have been scattered around an English village ahead of a visit by his brother, King Charles. Copies of an image, released in the Epstein files, that appears to show Andrew on all fours over an unidentified woman, were found in the area, which was hosting his brother King Charles and Queen Camilla.\n\nMeanwhile, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has apologised to victims of Jeffrey Epstein over his controversial decision to appoint Peter Mandelson as ambassador to the United States - despite his friendship with the late sex-offender. As pressure grows on the prime minister within his party and parliament, Mr Starmer said he was sorry for having believed lies by Lord Mandelson, whose name has appeared in the latest batch of Epstein files.\n\nWe speak to our UK political correspondent Rob Watson about the fallout within the UK Royal Family and the UK government and ask what will happen next.\n\nSubscribe to the Global News Podcast wherever you get your podcasts or find more episodes here: https://bbc.in/GlobalNewsPodcast\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#JeffreyEpstein #UK #BBCNews",

      "title": "First batch of Epstein files released",
      "description": "After months of political wrangling, parts of the long-awaited Epstein files have been released by the US Justice Department. The trove consists of thousands of documents related to the late sex-offender. Pictures include the former US President Bill Clinton, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor - Britain\u0027s former prince, musicians Mick Jagger and Michael Jackson. Being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing. The justice department did not release all existing files, and the published ones were heavily redacted, prompting frustrated reactions from survivors of Epstein\u0027s abuse. Also: the US carries out dozens of strikes against the Islamic State group in Syria. Anti-government youth protesters in South Korea are taking cues from the American right\u0027s MAGA movement. Italy announces a fee for tourists to visit the Trevi Fountain in Rome. Putin vows revenge on Ukraine after an oil tanker was blown up in the Mediterranean Sea. Palestinians tell the BBC they were sexually abused in Israeli prisons. And how a lost radio play by Tennessee Williams was found more than four decades after his death, and has now been heard for the first time.
