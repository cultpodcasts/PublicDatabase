      "description": "When news first broke of a billionaire sex offender with a private island\u2026 the story didn\u2019t erupt through traditional media. Instead it circulated through online message boards like 4chan. \nWhat began as internet trolling and fragmented rumor became fuel for something much bigger. The Epstein case fed directly into the rise of QAnon, a conspiracy movement built on the belief that a hidden elite was operating above the law. \nNow, after years of pressure and public obsession, millions of Epstein-related documents have been released by the U.S. government. \nThe Epstein Files have exposed networks, associations, and uncomfortable truths. But instead of restoring trust in institutions, they\u2019ve underscored how fragile that trust has become.\n \nCatch up on past If You\u0027re Listening episode\u0027s on Jeffrey Epstein: \n\nWas Jeffrey Epstein a Mossad agent?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toqY9NIADrY\n\nAre the MAGA podcasters right about Epstein? | If You\u0027re Listening\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zzWn4_Rrac\n\nWatch all episodes of If You\u0027re Listening - in our playlist: Subscribe: https://ab.co/3yqPOZ5\n\nSubscribe: https://ab.co/3yqPOZ5\n\nWelcome to ABC News In-depth, where you\u0027ll find our long-form journalism and other videos to help you understand what\u0027s going on in the world around you.\n\nWatch more ABC News content ad-free on ABC iview: https://ab.co/2OB7Mk1\n\nFor more from ABC News, click here: https://ab.co/2kxYCZY\n\nGet breaking news and livestreams from our ABC News channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/NewsOnABC\nLike ABC News on Facebook: http://facebook.com/abcnews.au\nFollow ABC News on Instagram: http://instagram.com/abcnews_au\nFollow ABC News on Twitter: http://twitter.com/abcnews\n\nNote: In most cases, our captions are auto-generated.\n\n#ABCNewsIndepth #ABCNewsAustralia",
