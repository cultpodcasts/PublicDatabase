      "description": "In the streets of suburban Sydney lies the spiritual headquarters of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church \u2014 a secretive, ultra-wealthy organisation whose $22 billion business empire stretches around the globe.  \n\nFormer members and even the Australian Prime Minister have accused the religious group, once known as the Exclusive Brethren, of operating like a cult, while its leader Bruce Hales and his family live in luxury, at the centre of a network of thousands of companies worldwide.  \n\nThis week on Four Corners, former members tell reporter Louise Milligan about the psychological manipulation, surveillance, and threats the church allegedly uses against them, as well as attempts to intimidate them and buy their silence.  \n\nBig Brethren charts how some companies that support the church have amassed billions and are now under scrutiny from the Australian Taxation Office.   \n\nWhistleblowers also reveal the group\u2019s attempts at political penetration, including covert election campaigning, despite members traditionally being discouraged from voting. \n\nNote: In most cases, our captions are auto-generated.\n\n#ABCNewsIndepth #ABCNewsAustralia",
