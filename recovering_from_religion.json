Jo shares her profound journey as an intersex individual, detailing her upbringing, the challenges she faced with gender identity, and the impact of religious beliefs on her life.\n\nJoanna discusses her experiences with conversion therapy, societal expectations, and the struggles of navigating her identity in a world that often lacks understanding and acceptance. She also reflects on her advocacy work and the importance of mental health support for those in similar situations. In this conversation, Jo shares their profound journey\nfrom a life steeped in religious belief to a path of self-discovery and acceptance of their gender identity. \n\nThe discussion delves into the intellectual struggles faced while reconciling faith with personal truth, the exploration of various belief systems, and the transition from anger towards a more nuanced understanding of identity and community. Jo emphasises the importance of finding supportive communities and allowing oneself to feel a range of emotions during this transformative process. The conversation also touches on the complexities of gender identity, societal perceptions, and the need for gradual progress in LGBTQ\u002B rights.\n\nWe\u0027re grateful to have been joined by Jo and learned a lot from this interview.",

What is the meaning of life? Of death? These are questions many people ask themselves as they progress through life at one time or another.

Sam grew up in South Australia and Queensland, was home schooled and later on educated in a religious high school. Sam shares his struggles with religious education and its issues in Australia. Sam also shares conflicts with his church on a musical note- (apparently there are ways to play the guitar that are \u0027evil\u0027) and how those and other conflicts eventually led him to leave the religion. \n\nOur interview also covers many other sub-topics, including sexuality, intellectual life as a believer and non-believer, growth and healing outside of religion, the role of friends and lovers in supporting us during the healing journey, major life choices made while religious, etc. \n\nWe\u0027re grateful to have been joined by Sam and thoroughly enjoyed the interview.",

      "description": "This week on RfRx, Rob Palmer questions the uniqueness of humanity. The Abrahamic religions teach that humans are special; we are God\u2019s special creation. Seemingly proving this, of all the billions of species to arise on Earth, only humans are intelligent enough to have created a civilization.  So, in that way at least, our species is VERY special. On this planet, anyway. On the other hand, space is a very big place, and the prevailing secular belief is that many other civilizations likely exist in the Milky Way. Many people even believe that beings from other worlds more advanced than us are routinely visiting Earth. If any of that is true, then we are not so special after all. So, is it likely extraterrestrial civilizations exist?  Or could humanity be alone in our galaxy, and thus VERY special indeed?\n\nHosted by Kara Griffin, RfR Online Programming Director, and Helen Green, RfR Ambassador\n\nRecorded on August 4, 2024\n\nResource List:\nYouTube: The UFO Movie THEY Don\u0027t Want You to See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09kAkzapPI\n\nYouTube: Are We Alone in The Galaxy?

However, she continued to believe it was the one true religion and it was just a matter of time before she would be killed in Armageddon.

She was also known for her portraits of her partner who was a transgender woman and an artist as well.\n\nTamara de Lempicka: Bisexual Polish artist who created stunning art deco portraits. Some of her works are also very kink coded. She lived openly and radically. \n\nLili Elbe: trans woman mentioned above, she and Gerda were partners and she did incredible artwork.\n\nFrida Kahlo: famous Mexican artist known for her authentic self portraits - most know her as the \u201Clady with the mustache\u201D. She created surrealist art about gender, race, Mexican identity, sexuality, and living with chronic pain as a result of a traumatic injury\n\nF\u00E9lix Gonz\u00E1lez-Torres: Cuban-American artist who did devastating art installations about living as a gay man. Content warning for his work - he created pieces about losing a partner to AIDS as well as living with it himself. He died of AIDS related complications at the peak of the epidemic in the 90s.\n\nRosa Bonheur: absolute badass lesbian French animal\u002Blivestock painter in the 19th century. She had to get legal permission to wear trousers while visiting livestock markets to paint and sometimes she would straight up just disguise herself as a man to do so. Her work is beyond incredible, she\u2019s genuinely one of the most skilled animal painters to ever work.\n\nKeith Haring: openly gay American pop artist who did iconic graphic illustrations about social justice, politics, drugs, and safe sex. He died of AIDS related complications in the 90s.\n\nJasper Johns: gay American abstract expressionist \u002B dada pop artist - set the record for most expensive painting ever sold of a living artist ($110 million!)\nAdam Ellis/Adam Tots: gay contemporary comic artist. He does absolutely hilarious pieces about modern issues/pop culture/navigating queerness and leftist politics.

      "description": "**Listener discretion is advised as this video contains a discussion regarding child sexual assault within the Catholic religion** \n\nIn this fourth episode of RfR Stories Australia, we hear Chrissie Foster\u0027s story. \nChrissie was raised Catholic in Australia and was devout throughout her early life and early adulthood. \n\nChrissies relationship with Catholicism took an incredibly dark turn when, to her and her family\u0027s horror they discovered that two of her daughters had become victims of one of the most famous Catholic child paedophiles in Australian history; \u0027Father\u0027 Kevin O\u2019Donnell. \n\nThis discovery began a series of tragic events in her and her family\u0027s life that she discusses in this video and in her book Hell On The Way to Heaven. \n\nDue to these events, Chrissie and her late husband Anthony began a journey of lifelong advocacy and activism on behalf of survivors of child sexual assault. Their efforts were part of the reason the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse occurred. \n\nChrissie has written two books about her experience. In Hell On The Way To Heaven she tells the story of her family\u0027s direct experience and how many tragic events unfolded as a direct consequence of her children\u0027s abuse (along with the inadequate responses by the Catholic church), and in Still Standing she speaks about the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse and her activism. \n\nChrissie is one of the most knowledgeable people in Australia about the phenomenon of child sexual assault in the Catholic church, she remains highly critical of the church\u0027s responses to the phenomenon of sexual abuse and well connected to the survivor community. Chrissie\u0027s story is like a flu vaccine for the immune system of society; the jab hurts for a bit, you might feel a fever for a few hours, but the real thing is far, far worse. \n\nWe\u0027re grateful to have been joined by Chrissie for this interview, and send our love and solidarity to her. Chrissie, along with you it was our honour and privilege to \u0022dwell compassionately on old wounds\u0022.",

Shawn grew up in South Africa and was raised Mormon (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints or LDS). When Shawn was 19 he left South Africa and went to England to \u0027serve\u0027 as a Mormon missionary for 2 years. After that he moved to Sydney. \n\nShawn was a devout Mormon throughout his twenties, \u0027serving\u0027 in various leadership positions, but eventually in his late twenties he became more interested in reconciling evolution with his religious worldview, experienced growth with his relationship with fear, and went on to experienced a full-blown faith crisis when learning more about science, evolution, \u0027spirituality\u0027 and Mormon history. \n\nShawn\u0027s been out of Mormonism now for almost 10 years and has been relatively public in his coming out, including being featured in the Sydney Morning Herald speaking about Mormon worthiness interviews. He is deeply interested in the emotional repercussions of having one\u0027s worldview turned upside down having experienced that firsthand. We\u2019re grateful to have Shawn as a volunteer in RfR, one of the hosts of RfR Stories, and deputy-chair of RfR Australia.",

The presentation will cover the different evolutionary stages all religions appear to have gone through, the surprising twists and turns in the development of monotheism, how all our major religions appear to share the problem of having imaginary founders, and more.\n\nDavid Fitzgerald is an atheist author, public speaker and historical researcher who has been actively investigating the Historical Jesus question for over twenty years. He was an associate member of CSER (the former Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion). He lectures around the world at universities, national secular events, churches, and secular and religious groups. He has appeared on The Atheist Experience television program and in several documentaries, including Batman \u0026 Jesus, My Week in Atheism and most recently, Marketing the Messiah.\n\nDavid\u2019s latest book is the three-volume set Jesus: Mything in Action (the follow-up book to his classic on Jesus Mythicism, NAILED: Ten Christian Myths that Show Jesus Never Existed at All) and the newest addition to his ongoing series, The Complete Heretic\u2019s Guide to Western Religion.

She married the pastor\u2019s son and raised two children in the faith. However, as she became more educated, she increasingly had doubts and concerns regarding her religious faith, culminating in a transition out in her 40s. \n\nSallyann is now a therapist.

How healthy is the idea of \u201Cbiblical sex,\u201D and how has purity culture distorted sex-ed and damaged lives? Seth tackles the taboos and shares his experience escaping its negative influence.\n\nSeth Andrews is a broadcaster, storyteller, author, activist, and public speaker best known as host of the popular website, podcast, and online community, The Thinking Atheist.\nOriginally the product of Christian fundamentalism, today Seth is an advocate, not for religion, but for people, and while he - as a storyteller - loves the distraction of supernatural fiction (like the annual Halloween \u0022Ghost Stories\u0022 broadcast and new audiobook), he ultimately encourages everyone to root their pursuit of the truth in reason and evidence, and to pursue a Personal Relationship With Reality.\n\n0:00 - Guest Introduction\n1:03:15 - Q\u0026A\n1:23:42 - RfR Moment, Dr. Darrel Ray\n\nHosted by Kara Griffin, RfR Online Programming Director, and Helen Green, RfR Ambassador\n\nRecorded on December 4, 2023\n\nGuest Links:\nhttps://www.thethinkingatheist.com/\n\nTrue Stories with Seth Andrews Podcast: https://www.truestoriespodcast.com/\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Christianity-Made-Talk-Like-Idiot/dp/1977250785\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/sethandrews\n\n\nThe primary focus of Recovering from Religion (RfR) is to offer hope, healing, and support to those struggling with issues of doubt and non-belief.

She grew up on a farm south of Nashville, Tennessee where she was indoctrinated into the Southern Baptist faith from birth. After deconstructing religion in college, she became involved in activism for various causes. Joining the third wave intersectional feminist movement, Glenda believes that liberation from the patriarchy and the destructive influence of misogynistic faiths are inexorably linked.

      "description": "This week on RfRx, Rob Palmer returns to discuss mass psychogenic illness. Have U.S. government employees in Havana and all around the world \u2013 even behind the White House gates \u2013 been attacked and injured over the past seven years by secret energy-weapons wielded by undiscovered assailants for political reasons? Have thousands of girls in their schools across Iran been poisoned this past year by their Islamic government as retribution for the mass anti-hijab protests? Did a 4-ft tall roller-skating Monkey Man with metal claws and glowing red eyes attack people throughout New Delhi causing injuries and deaths? Believe it or not, there is a connection between these seemingly unrelated headline-grabbing events. This presentation will examine a little recognized and less understood phenomenon that is likely the actual culprit in these and a myriad of similar events that have occurred throughout the world and throughout human history: Mass Psychogenic Illness. Rob Palmer is a retired aerospace engineer. He has been a spacecraft designer, spacecraft tester, computer programmer, and software systems engineer. Rob became a skeptical activist in 2016 upon joining the Guerrilla Skeptics on Wikipedia team, and in 2018 became a columnist for Skeptical Inquirer. To date he has had over 70 articles published by Skeptical Inquirer as well as in other publications, and the Wikipedia articles he\u2019s written have garnered over 13 million pageviews. Rob writes about contemporary skeptical issues, and has interviewed individuals as diverse as Neil deGrasse Tyson, Richard Dawkins, Penn Jillette, Ann Druyan (producer and writer for the modern Cosmos series), Dave Warnock (Of Dying Out Loud), Seth Andrews (host of The Thinking Atheist podcast), John de Lancie (Star Trek\u2019s Q), and even God - eh, Mr. Deity - himself. Rob is registered with the Center for Inquiry\u2019s Speakers Bureau, and has given presentations for various skeptic and humanist groups and conventions, including: We Can Reason, Dragon Con, and three times at CSICon (the annual science and skepticism conference in Las Vegas). He has been interviewed about these subjects on various podcasts and YouTube shows, including The Skeptic Zone, Big Picture Science, Be Rationable, The Phil Ferguson Show, Banachek\u2019s Brain, 502 Conversations, Point of Inquiry, The Thinking Atheist, and here for RfRx.

      "description": "Dave Warnock was caught up in the Jesus movement of the 70s and lived the bulk of his life as a Charismatic Evangelical, serving as a pastor on three different church staffs. \n\nFollowing several years of internal struggle, Dave came to the conclusion in 2011 that he no longer believed in a personal God. In 2019 he was diagnosed with  ALS (Lou Gehrig\u0027s disease), a progressive neurodegenerative disease with a typical 3-5 year life expectancy. \n\nDave is spending the days he has left speaking out about the dangers and harm of fundamental religions, with a focus on Evangelical Christianity.  He also seeks to provide a safe haven to those questioning their faith, recovering from religious trauma or navigating life\u0027s tribulations as he shares his own perspective as a former ex-evangelical, but now an atheist, facing a terminal diagnosis. He is a celebrated public speaker, host of the podcast \u201CDying Out Loud\u201D, co-founder of the non-profit \u201CI Am Dying Out Loud\u201D and author of the memoir \u201CChildish Things\u201D.\n\n\nHosted by Kara Griffin, RfR Online Programming Director, and Helen Greene, RfR Ambassador and Rob Palmer, RfR Ambassador\n\nRecorded on September 11, 2023\n\nGuest Links:\nhttps://daveoutloud.org/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@DaveOutLoud\nhttps://iamdyingoutloud.org/\nChildish Things: A Memoir https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/60390630\n\n\nThe primary focus of Recovering from Religion (RfR) is to offer hope, healing, and support to those struggling with issues of doubt and non-belief.

For this week\u2019s RfRx Foundation Spotlight episode, we chat with Lucien Greaves, co-founder of the Satanic Temple, about non-theistic religious expression, what religious liberty really looks like, and the Satanic Temple\u2019s efforts to encourage benevolence and empathy, reject tyrannical authority, and oppose injustice. Bring your questions for Lucien and join us for a wicked good time! Lucien Greaves is a social activist and co-founder and spokesperson for the Satanic Temple. Lucien has been involved in varied legal efforts advocating for the acceptance of non-theistic religious exemption and privilege, secularism, and fighting against theocratic encroachments on civil liberties. The organization is best known for its ongoing legal efforts to place a Satanic monument next to 10 Commandments monuments on public grounds, and to oppose reproductive rights restrictions nationwide. Lucien has been featured on numerous national news programs and in the documentary film \u201CHail Satan?\u201D.

Dr. Ray will show how emotions like fear and disgust are used by religion. He will also demonstrate how religion interferes with our normal attachment systems and how religion distorts normal development from childhood to adulthood among many other things. If you have experienced trauma, can\u0027t get over fear of hell, feel disgust at things that seem normal to other people, you will find this an interesting and helpful talk. Dr Darrel Ray is the Founder and president of Recovering from Religion. He has been a psychologist for over thirty years and is the author of four books: including \u0022The God Virus-How Religion Infects Our Lives and Culture\u0022 and \u0022Sex and God-How Religion Distorts Sexuality\u0022. Dr. Ray has been a student of religion most of his life and holds a Masters\u0027s Degree in religion as well as a Bachelor\u0027s Degree in Sociology/Anthropology with a Doctorate in Psychology.

Andrew will further discuss his experiences with fundamentalism and the intersection of religious trauma and queerness. Andrew Pledger is a content creator, activist, and writer who uses social media to share his story and inspire others. He is a religious trauma survivor who was homeschooled K-12 and raised in a fundamentalist Christian cult (Independent Fundamental Baptist movement). He brings awareness to spiritual and religious abuse. Being a part of the LGBTQ\u002B community and experiencing religious trauma has inspired him to pursue psychology to help survivors. After being homeschooled, he found his way to Bob Jones University. He attended the fundamentalist Christian college for over three years until he was expelled in his last semester for sharing his story and denouncing fundamentalist teachings. Andrew comes on the show to share his experiences of his upbringing and the level of control and mental abuse he experienced at Bob Jones University. He has a limited podcast premiering soon called \u0022Surviving Bob Jones University: A Christian Cult.\u0022 This podcast explores the school\u0027s history, the psychology of fundamentalism, the criteria for cults, and survivors\u0027 experiences.

      "description": "This week on RfRx, Rob Palmer is returning to host Part II of the interactive logical fallacies trivia challenge. Bring your A-game and play trivia with us, or just come watch the show and hone your critical thinking skills. Why? Because recognizing these bad arguments can help you do two things: avoid being deceived by false claims made by others, and also stop using them yourself to justify questionable beliefs of your own. Rob will give a refresher on logical fallacies and then we\u2019ll play an interactive trivia game where those in attendance can play on teams trying to outdo their competition in describing and identifying Logical Fallacies! (Game-play participation is optional.) Rob Palmer has had a diverse aerospace engineering career, having worked as a spacecraft designer and tester, computer programmer, and software systems engineer. Rob began writing for Skeptical Inquirer in 2018 and has had over 60 articles published by Skeptical Inquirer and in other publications in 2 languages on 3 continents. Rob writes about contemporary skeptical issues and has interviewed individuals as diverse as scientists Neil deGrasse Tyson and Richard Dawkins, Ann Druyan (producer and writer for the modern Cosmos series), Seth Andrews (host of The Thinking Atheist podcast), and even John de Lancie (Star Trek\u2018s Q). Rob has also been a speaker for various skeptic and humanist groups, including here at Recovering from Religion. He has spoken at Dragon Con, and thrice at CSICon, (the annual science and skepticism conference in Las Vegas.) Topics have included critical thinking, psychics and mediums, and the international Wikipedia editing project he volunteers for. He has been interviewed about these subjects on various podcasts and YouTube shows, including The Skeptic Zone, Big Picture Science, Be Rationable, The Phil Ferguson Show, Banachek\u2019s Brain, 502 Conversations, and The Thinking Atheist.

Raised Roman Catholic, then rejecting the church to move into paganism, she was a pagan high priestess for 10 years during her time in that faith (which was 13 years). \n\nEventually realizing through education and skeptical inquiry into herself, she came to the conclusion she had no solid evidence for her beliefs \u2013 which brought her to a more humanistic and realistic worldview. \n\nStill studying psychology even out of college, she spends her time trying to understand human behavior, the emotional and psychological understandings of ourselves, and what forms our perspectives and why. \n\nOn top of her volunteer work here at RfR, she is also a volunteer at the Atheist Community of Austin, an advocate of LGBTQIA\u002B rights, and a cohost of the podcast Left of the Valley. \n\n00:00 - Guest Intro\n1:13:53 - Q\u0026A\n\nHosted by Kara Griffin, RfR Online Programming Director, and Rob Palmer, RfR Ambassador\n\nRecorded on February 27, 2023\n\nResource List:\nCognitive Reflection Test\nhttps://mindyourdecisions.com/blog/2013/06/24/can-you-correctly-answer-the-cognitive-reflection-test-83-percent-of-people-miss-at-least-1-question/\n\nWhat is magical thinking?\nhttps://theconversation.com/what-is-magical-thinking-and-do-we-grow-out-of-it-35384\n\nWhen to get help:\nhttps://www.healthline.com/health/magical-thinking#when-to-get-help\n\nBrain lesions \u0026 magical thinking study:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6197485/#:~:text=Magical%20ideation%20refers%20to%20uncanny,they%20differ%20in%20several%20ways.\n\nGuest Links:\nLeft of the Valley Podcast  https://www.youtube.com/@LeftattheValley\nThe Non-Prophets  https://youtu.be/wRUvesVe6so\nPrevious RfRx talk https://youtu.be/BFpk1JMXcu4\n\nThe primary focus of Recovering from Religion (RfR) is to offer hope, healing, and support to those struggling with issues of doubt and non-belief.

      "description": "Erin grew up in a Charismatic Pentecostal family and did it all; the Sunday school, Awanas bible memorization, youth groups, purity rings, summer camps, faith healing, and speaking in tongues. She did long term Missionary work, played worship bands and even went to bible college for a while. In 2019, now married with 2 kids, she deconstructed her faith completely and became an Atheist. She first started sharing her story anonymously online which quickly turned into her becoming an outspoken Atheist Activist. She now hosts a call-in show and is active in many online and in-person Atheist Organizations. Her journey from Christianity to Atheist Activist has meant looking back and dissecting the harm caused by extreme supernatural beliefs. Now, she continues to share her experiences and tries to help others think deeply about what they believe and why.\n\n01:12 - RfR Australia Update\n07:49 - Guest Introduction\n13:28 - Talk Begins\n1:18:25 - Q\u0026A\n1:38:57 - RfR Moment, Dr. Darrel Ray\n\nHosted by Kara Griffin, RfR Online Programming Director, and Helen Greene, RfR Ambassador\n\nRecorded on February 20, 2023\n\nGuest Links:\nhttps://twitter.com/exxtianerin\nTruth Wanted on ACA\n\n\nThe primary focus of Recovering from Religion (RfR) is to offer hope, healing, and support to those struggling with issues of doubt and non-belief.

At 12, he was told he was a prophet of God, but was also under attack by demons. He was the subject of multiple exorcism attempts, to no avail, and was ultimately shunned by his church group and entire community, which led to spiraling into an intense depression. After going through numerous painful life experiences, Jason discovered the field of psychology and realized it was something he wanted to devote his life to.

He began as a Skeptic educator around two years ago - like many others taking the opportunity during the beginning of the covid pandemic to find a new way of communicating with people. It was around the same time that he began volunteering with the ACA and undertook his degree in religion, philosophy and ethics - a move encouraged by his wife to formalize his lifelong interest.\n\nToday he has his own skeptic show on YouTube which looks at different topics with a heavy focus on academia as well as being the co founder and co host of the weekly Skeptic Hangout Podcast and a Host on the ACA\u2019s non Prophet\u2019s show.\n\nIn addition he has been a regular host on Ethan Micheal\u2019s \u2018The Perspective\u2019, International Freethinkers \u2018We are parents\u2019 and guest host on \u2018Truth Wanted\u2019 and \u2018Talk Heathen\u2019 - both produced by the ACA.

      "description": "After the recent Supreme Court decision overturning the landmark Roe v Wade decision, many people have been left wondering what happens next. Join us for a discussion about the connections between religion and reproductive rights in the US, how to find support if you are struggling, and outline some of the ways that Recovering From Religion is responding.\n\nDr Darrel Ray is the Founder \u0026 President of Recovering from Religion. He has been a psychologist for over forty years and is the author of four books: including \u0022The God Virus-How Religion Infects Our Lives and Culture\u0022 and \u0022Sex and God-How Religion Distorts Sexuality\u0022. Dr. Ray has been a student of religion most of his life and holds a Masters Degree in religion as well as a Bachelor\u0027s Degree in Sociology/Anthropology with a Doctorate in Psychology.\n\nGayle Jordan is an estate-planning attorney, and former Southern Baptist, who left the faith years ago when her then-teenagers began asking questions she could not answer. Her research led her (and her children) into the light of reason and rationality. Years later, she still feels the effects, both positive and negative, of that dramatic shift in perspective and attitude. It is this sympathy and compassion that drives her to reach out to help others to navigate the emotional and physical process involved in leaving one\u2019s faith. She serves as Executive Director at RfR. \n\nHelen Greene has a degree in psychology from the University of South Florida, works in human resourcing, and is an LGBTQIA\u002B advocate. She also enjoys spending time with her hubby and kids, loves scifi and horror movies, and is a huge Tolkien nerd. She serves as a support group leader and ambassador for RfR, in addition to frequently cohosting RfRx. \n\nDavid Teachout is a mental health therapist and photographer, focused on and teaching how creativity intersects with mental flexibility in working through the inevitable difficulties in life. David grew up as a Christian fundamentalist, attending a bible college and receiving a bachelor\u2019s in theology and psychology. During his studies there, David deconverted and has been on a journey of more deeply appreciating the many nuances of humanity ever since. David has a master\u2019s in both forensic psychology and counseling psychology, and is currently at work on a doctorate in clinical psychology. David has been actively working within the field of psychology as therapist, social worker, advocate, and subject-matter-expert, for over fifteen years. \n\n00:00 - Intro\n12:07 - Panel Introduction\n15:07 - Discussion Begins\n1:27:12 - Q\u0026A\n1:43:25 - RfR Moment with Dr. Darrel Ray, RfR President\n\nHosted by Kara Griffin, RfR Online Programming Director\n\nRecorded on August 8, 2022\n\nThe primary focus of Recovering from Religion (RfR) is to offer hope, healing, and support to those struggling with issues of doubt and non-belief.

They aren\u2019t in the headlines anymore and seem to have given up trying to get their \u201Cscience\u201D taught in the public schools. But the ground rules for deciding First Amendment religion clause cases have changed in the last few years, which affects the seemingly perpetual struggle to keep good science in, and Creationism out, of the public school science class\n\nDr. Eugenie C.

      "description": "Ross Blocher was born into a family of evangelical Christians and spent a good amount of time in churches of various denominations, singing in choirs, serving as an acolyte, and memorizing lots of scripture. (which gave him good practice for memorizing an inhuman number of the digits of Pi.) \n\nMeanwhile, he busied himself reading books about ghosts, vampires, aliens, and chupacabras. In college, while serving as president of a Bible study group, he started attending skeptical lectures and reading science books, coming to the conclusion that he\u0027d been wrong about reality his whole life. \n\nWhile the beliefs went away, his interest in them didn\u0027t, and Ross has spent the time since trying to find out why people believe what they do, and participating in the Independent Investigations Group, which investigates claims of the paranormal from a scientific viewpoint.\n\nRoss is an accomplished animation professional working at Disney. He has worked on numerous award-winning films including The Princess and the Frog and The Simpsons Movie. The latest film he has a credit on is the just released Wish. You can learn more about Ross at http://rossblocher.com.\n\nSince early 2011, Ross has co-hosted a Skeptically themed weekly podcast called Oh No, Ross and Carrie. This is some info about the show from Wikipedia: Oh No, Ross and Carrie! is an investigative journalism podcast produced in Los Angeles and distributed by the Maximum Fun network. The hosts personally investigate claims about spirituality, fringe science, religion, and the paranormal, then discuss their findings on the show.

      "description": "Throughout millennia people have been treated like objects, and not as the free-willed individuals they were. We are really not too far removed from the days of chattel marriages and slavery, and those outdated ideas of people as objects still show up in our religious belief systems, our language, and our behaviors. In this RfRx discussion, Glenda Jordan will explore the difference between objectification and empowerment. When is a woman objectified? What makes a woman empowered? These buzzwords may seem confusing at first, but through the lens of contemporary feminist theory and female performance, the distinction between the two will become clear.\n\nGlenda Jordan is a professional model and artist, with a decade long career in Las Vegas as a dancer and entertainer. Raised Southern Baptist, Glenda had her secular and feminist awakening in her early 20s. When she\u2019s not performing or working in her studio, she enjoys marathon video game sessions, traveling, and spending time with her many pets.\n\n0:00 - RfRx Intro\n08:23 - Guest Introduction\n09:18 - Topic Begins\n57:31 - Q\u0026A Discussion\n1:22:10 - RfR Moment by Gayle Jordan, RfR Executive Director\n\nHosted by Eric Wells, RfR Support Group Director, and Sherrie D\u0027Souza, RfR Board Member and International Expansion Director\n\nRecorded on April 4, 2022\n\n\nThe primary focus of Recovering from Religion (RfR) is to offer hope, healing, and support to those struggling with issues of doubt and non-belief.

      "description": "David Teachout returns to help us answer the perennial question: What does love got to do with it? What is this fantastic emotion? From troubadours to modern musicians and rom-coms, myths to personal declarations, love and its many manifestations is almost as synonymous with humanity as the capacity for reason. Perhaps that\u2019s why they\u2019re so often pitted against one another. Let\u2019s explore love, both as a feeling and an emotion, a few expressions of it including monogamy, polyamory and relationship anarchy, and find a few principles to help us on our own tunnels of love. David Teachout is a mental health therapist and photographer, focused on and teaching how creativity intersects with mental flexibility to work through life\u2019s struggles. David grew up as a Christian fundamentalist, attending a bible college and receiving a bachelor\u2019s in theology and psychology. During his studies there, David deconverted and has been on a journey of appreciating humanity and all the stories we create to build meaning and purpose. David has a master\u2019s in both forensic psychology and counseling psychology, and is currently at work on a doctorate in clinical psychology. David has been actively working within the field of psychology as therapist, social worker, advocate, and subject-matter-expert, for over fifteen years. In his spare time, David enjoys reading a copious amount, both fiction and non-fiction, exploring perspective through photography, and maintains a blog at www.lifeweavings.com and a podcast at www.humanitysvalues.com The primary focus of Recovering from Religion (RfR) is to offer hope, healing, and support to those struggling with issues of doubt and non-belief.

His broader aim is to ground our understanding of feeling and thought in the facts of biology. Dr. Reimers was raised Christian but found a path to humanism in his twenties.

      "description": "In this week\u2019s RfRx, Tahlia Newland will join us to discuss what Tibetan Buddhism is. Its practices, beliefs, and leadership may be foreign and exotic to Western minds, making it a tempting religion to join. We\u2019ll learn about its belief systems, its leadership, some history, and the struggles adherents experience within and trying to transition out of this religion.\n\nTahlia is an editor, publisher and mask maker and was a Tibetan Buddhist for 20 years. She spent twelve years in a partial home retreat, completed advanced practices, trained as a meditation instructor, and was the Teaching Services Director of Rigpa Australia\u2019s Distance Education Centre for 12 years. She left her Tibetan Buddhist community, Rigpa, after revelations that her teacher, Sogyal Rinpoche, was physically, emotionally and sexually abusing his close students. She wrote a book called Fallout: Recovering from Abuse in Tibetan Buddhism about the subsequent learning she and others went through in the wake of the revelations. She also has a YouTube channel called Beyond the Temple. \n\n0:00 - RfRx Intro\n08:53 - Guest Introduction\n10:08 - Topic Begins\n1:35:40 - Q\u0026A Discussion\n\nHosted by Eric Wells, RfR Support Group Director, and Trent Emory, RfR Helpline Agent\n\nRecorded on March 28, 2022\n\nLink to Newland\u0027s Book:\nhttps://www.tahlianewland.com/product/fallout-recovering-from-abuse-in-tibetan-buddhism/\n\nThe primary focus of Recovering from Religion (RfR) is to offer hope, healing, and support to those struggling with issues of doubt and non-belief. This transitional period is an ongoing process that can result in a range of emotions, as well as a ripple effect of consequences throughout an individual\u2019s life. We are here to help each other through this journey. \n\nFor RfRx comments, inquiries \u0026 topical questions, email us at RfRx@recoveringfromreligion.org.\n\nAny time you are struggling with religious doubts or fears you can connect with a trained RfR Helpline agent 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

      "description": "For the first RfRx episode of 2023, we are joined by former Canadian Pentecostal turned secular activist, Stacie Grahn. From Pentecostal to Reformed theology, she only ever wanted to find the truth. In this episode, Stacie will discuss her incredible journey over the past year as, not intending to get rid of her faith, she overcame fear, faced down cognitive dissonance, and ultimately found healing in online activism. After 38 years of living the \u201Cperfect\u201D Christian life, being a mother of 3 young boys and a wife of 15 years, Stacie Grahn began to have doubts about her faith as she watched countless other Christians fall for conspiracies. How could people shun science and blindly believe misinformation so easily? That was the tipping point for her to examine what she believed and why. From Pentecostal to Reformed theology, Stacie only ever wanted to find the truth. When the cognitive dissonance was finally put to rest, she found healing in online activism and publicly de-converting. She now shares her story through various online platforms, promotes secular and skeptic thinking, and loves connecting with others who have been through the same religious trauma she experienced.

Now he volunteers and advocates for secular causes promoting science and critical thinking. Kelley left Christianity as a teenager, explored a bunch of different religions, and ended up believing in a lot of woo. He started field collecting and making jewelry in his early 20s and later started his own business which he has now been at for 40 years. He later went back to college to take a few geology classes so he could answer questions about crystals, and the more he studied the science behind it, the more he became intrigued. Kelley has since co-authored several geology papers, some of them peer-reviewed. He is a regular host on the Atheist Community of Austin (ACA) show \u2018Non-Prophets\u2019, and volunteers as a moderator at Atheist Community of Discord where he also hosts \u2018Meet the ACA\u2019 and the ACA aftershows.

      "description": "When transitioning out of religion, we may leave more than just a deity behind. Views on any number of social issues can unexpectedly shift from one side of to another. This shift tends to provide the flexibility of seeing the issues from many different viewpoints, which can be both a blessing and a curse. In this RfRx, Gayle Jordan will share her eye-opening, frustrating, and hilarious story of running as an open atheist for a seat as a Tennessee State Senator in 2016 \u0026 2018. We\u2019ll also explore how her views on social issues changed as she transitioned from being a devout Southern Baptist to identifying as an atheist.\n\nGayle Jordan is an estate-planning attorney and former Southern Baptist who left the faith years ago when her then-teenagers began asking questions she could not answer. Her research led her (and her children) into the light of reason and rationality. Years later, she still feels the effects, both positive and negative, of that dramatic shift in perspective and attitude. It is this sympathy and compassion that drives her to reach out to help others navigate the emotional and physical process involved in leaving one\u2019s faith. Gayle lives in Oregon where she raises goats and chickens, and is trying her hand at grape-growing at her sunny hillside home affectionately known as Peak Heathen. She blogs about a variety of topics at Happy. Healthy. Heathen.\n\n0:00:00 - RfRx Opening\n0:09:40 - Guest Introduction\n0:11:05 - Topic Discussion Begins\n1:05:15 - Q\u0026A Session Begins\n1:19:53 - Closing Thoughts with Dr. Darrel Ray\n\nHosted by Eric Wells, RfR Support Group Director, and Rob Palmer, RfR Helpline Agent and Ambassador \n\nRecorded on March 7, 2022\n\nThe primary focus of Recovering from Religion (RfR) is to offer hope, healing, and support to those struggling with issues of doubt and non-belief.

Help us celebrate our favorite secular holiday by bringing your spooky costumes, scary stories, and skeptical questions. Stick around for the hangout afterwards to compete for best costume bragging rights. David Teachout is a mental health therapist and photographer, focused on and teaching how creativity intersects with mental flexibility in working through the inevitable difficulties in life.

During his studies there, David deconverted and has been on a journey of more deeply appreciating the many nuances of humanity ever since. David has a master\u2019s in both forensic psychology and counseling psychology, and is currently at work on a doctorate in clinical psychology. David has been actively working within the field of psychology as therapist, social worker, advocate, and subject-matter-expert, for over fifteen years.

Former pastor and author Darante\u2019 LaMar Martin joins us to share his inspirational experience of questioning faith, leaving the fold, and ultimately rebuilding community. He will discuss why secular communities don\u2019t need a blueprint and why they have a responsibility to impact the world around them. \n\nDarante\u2019 LaMar\u0027s journey from serving as a leader in both charismatic megachurches and hyper spiritual storefront churches, to embracing a life of secularism and reason, offers a unique perspective on the evolution of faith in contemporary society. With a background that includes virtually every role within the ministry, Darante\u2019 brings a comprehensive understanding of the inner workings of religious organizations and the impact they have on individuals and communities. Currently, Darante\u2019 serves as the chairperson of DLDD World Group - a nonprofit committed to people centric progress, projects, and programs, such as Sunday Sessions, Bible Study With An X-Pastor, Group Therapy and The X-Pastor Call-In Show. He is the author of four published books: Significant, Parenting on Purpose, Memphis: The Last Supper and Christ Held Up as well as four upcoming books, Making The Jump, Give Me Freedom, Memphis: The Second Dawn and The Case for Religion. \n\nHosted by Kara Griffin, RfR Online Programming Director, and Helen Green, RfR Ambassador\n\nRecorded on July 15, 2024\n\nGuest Links:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbROOoAVy40Cv5NtKccRClg \nhttps://www.facebook.com/darante.martin/ \nhttps://twitter.com/DaranteLaMarX \nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@darantelamar7 \nhttps://www.dldd.us\nSignificant - https://www.amazon.com/Significant-diffidence-confidence-Darante-LaMar/dp/1506105572/ref=monarch_sidesheet \nMemphis: The Last Supper - https://www.amazon.com/Memphis-Supper-Darante-LaMar-Martin/dp/1707688699/ref=monarch_sidesheet \nChrist Held Up - https://www.amazon.com/Christ-Held-Up-Whats-Taking/dp/B0D7PWMNX1\n\n\nThe primary focus of Recovering from Religion (RfR) is to offer hope, healing, and support to those struggling with issues of doubt and non-belief.

      "description": "This week on RfRx, Richard Gilliver will be joining us to talk about being a skeptic who studies religion academically and how that produces a different viewpoint when discussing the topic with other people. He will also discuss skepticism and the difficulties for supernatural claims when skepticism is applied. Richard Gilliver has been having discussions with religious people for thirty years, originally via talking to them in the street, then on internet message boards and more recently on social media. He has studied Buddhist meditation for two decades and took an academic interest in religious scriptures - specifically from Buddhism, Islam and Christianity around a decade ago. He began as a Skeptic educator around two years ago - like many others taking the opportunity during the beginning of the covid pandemic to find a new way of communicating with people. It was around the same time that he began volunteering with the ACA and undertook his degree in religion, philosophy and ethics - a move encouraged by his wife to formalize his lifelong interest. Today he has his own skeptic show on YouTube and is the co-founder and co-host of the weekly Skeptic Hangout Podcast and a Host on the ACA\u2019s non Prophet\u2019s show.

      "title": "E156: Religion: What Is It Good For? w/ Kara Griffin, PhD",
      "description": "In this episode, cultural anthropologist Kara Griffin will discuss religion as a social institution. Why is religious belief so common, even considered by some to be a universal human experience? Is it possible to have a functional society without religious belief? Why do some people reject the dominant beliefs of the community they grew up in while others seemingly never question it? We will examine the role of religion as a social institution in various settings, debunk some common myths, and explore recent trends in religious beliefs and practices from an anthropological perspective. Kara Griffin was born in Texas and raised in Southern Baptist, evangelical, and non-denominational mega-churches and private schools. After leaving the faith in the mid-2000s, Kara was able to pursue their passion for learning, traveling, and experiencing diverse cultures and perspectives. They holds undergraduate degrees in Psychology, International Relations, and Criminal Justice, a Master\u2019s Degree in Dispute Resolution \u0026 Conflict Management, and a PhD in Anthropology. Kara enjoys working with secular community services that support other people who may have experienced judgment, repression, or other struggles related to involvement with religious groups. At RfR, Kara volunteers as the Online Programming Director and hosts the weekly RfRx Talks sessions. In their free time, Kara can be found volunteering, teaching and lecturing at universities and conferences, reading all kinds of books (especially sci-fi), and spending time with their dog, Snow.

      "description": "What happens when one partner doesn\u2019t believe? What happens when the foundation of your relationship is no longer the foundation? Sherrie D\u2019Souza will share her experiences and insights gained from navigating different faiths in a marriage relationship. And - spoiler alert! - returning co-host Sacha D\u2019Souza will be joining the conversation to share his perspective, as well. Sherrie D\u0027Souza was born and raised in Sydney Australia as a Jehovah\u0027s Witness, devoting much of her youth to full-time volunteering for the religion. After learning of the gross cover-up of child sexual abuse in the religion, she left the religion in 2016 (following her husband Sacha, who had patiently waited for his wife to wake up from the cult). Sherrie is passionate about supporting others and in April 2020 started the first RfR Support Group in Sydney. With a secular background in healthcare administration, Sherrie now works from home and enjoys the flexibility this gives her to do more in establishing RfR in Australia. When she isn\u0027t banging away at her keyboard, you will find her playing with her Abyssinian cats, Abernathy \u0026 Sidney, indulging in her hobbies of cross stitching and diamond painting or just chilling watching Sci-Fi with Sacha.

      "description": "How have the dominant species of religions evolved over human history? And why? Archeology suggests that some religious practices go back tens of thousands of years or more. However these ancient religious practices among hunter-gatherers bear little resemblance to organized religion today. Religions centered around morality emerged in early farming societies; a leading hypothesis is that such moralizing religions enabled trust and cooperation within these tight knit communities. High gods emerged about the time large scale societies formed; a leading hypothesis is that those gods functioned to give legitimacy to rulers. Dr Mark Reimers will discuss the evidence for and against these hypotheses as well as consider how priests and kings co\u00F6pted religious authority in the Bronze Age. A pivotal change in religious sensibility occurred in the first millennium BCE as the leaders in religious thinking attempted to disentangle religion and politics, giving rise to further attempts at reforms which eventually gave birth to Christianity and Islam. This talk will also include a discussion on the rapidly evolving religions of modern post-industrial societies. Dr. Mark Reimers is a computational neuroscientist at Michigan State University where he researches how animal brains work and how human genes affect brain function. His broader aim is to ground our understanding of feeling and thought in the facts of biology. Dr. Reimers was raised Christian but found a path to humanism in his twenties. Since then he has been a humanist leader and speaker for over a decade in Virginia and now in Michigan.

      "description": "Throughout millennia people have been treated like objects, and not as the free-willed individuals they were. We are really not too far removed from the days of chattel marriages and slavery, and those outdated ideas of people as objects still show up in our religious belief systems, our language, and our behaviors. In this RfRx discussion, Glenda Jordan will explore the difference between objectification and empowerment. When is a woman objectified? What makes a woman empowered? These buzzwords may seem confusing at first, but through the lens of contemporary feminist theory and female performance, the distinction between the two will become clear. Glenda Jordan is a professional model and artist, with a decade long career in Las Vegas as a dancer and entertainer. Raised Southern Baptist, Glenda had her secular and feminist awakening in her early 20s. When she\u2019s not performing or working in her studio, she enjoys marathon video game sessions, traveling, and spending time with her many pets.

Its practices, beliefs, and leadership may be foreign and exotic to Western minds, making it a tempting religion to join. We\u2019ll learn about its belief systems, its leadership, some history, and the struggles adherents experience within and trying to transition out of this religion. Tahlia Newland has published seven novels-four of which have won literary awards-one book of short stories, and a non-fiction book on writing. She works as an editor and publisher for AIA Publishing. Tahlia devoted twenty-years of her life to the study and practice of Tibetan Buddhism, twelve of those years in partial home retreat. She lives in the Australian bush with a musical husband, a filmmaker daughter, and a couple of cheeky Burmese cats.

      "description": "When transitioning out of religion, we may leave more than just a deity behind. Views on any number of social issues can unexpectedly shift from one side of to another. This shift tends to provide the flexibility of seeing the issues from many different viewpoints, which can be both a blessing and a curse. In this RfRx, Gayle Jordan will share her eye-opening, frustrating, and hilarious story of running as an open atheist for a seat as a Tennessee State Senator in 2016 \u0026 2018. We\u2019ll also explore how her views on social issues changed as she transitioned from being a devout Southern Baptist to identifying as an atheist. Gayle Jordan is an estate-planning attorney and former Southern Baptist who left the faith years ago when her then-teenagers began asking questions she could not answer. Her research led her (and her children) into the light of reason and rationality. Years later, she still feels the effects, both positive and negative, of that dramatic shift in perspective and attitude. It is this sympathy and compassion that drives her to reach out to help others navigate the emotional and physical process involved in leaving one\u2019s faith. Gayle lives in Oregon where she raises goats and chickens, and is trying her hand at grape-growing at her sunny hillside home affectionately known as Peak Heathen. She blogs about a variety of topics at Happy. Healthy. Heathen. For RfRx comments, inquiries \u0026 topical questions, email us at RfRx@recoveringfromreligion.org.

      "description": "Suicide is an ever present part of our human experience, be it through an acquaintance, friend, or family member taking their own life, or something even more personal, such as suicidal thoughts and attempts. When faced with suicide, whether it\u2019s as close as someone coming to you for help, or as distant as media reports, it can be daunting to know what to do and if you could have done something to prevent it. In this RfRx discussion, Dr. Andy Thomson will walk us through how to assess the signs, how to understand why suicide is a human universal, as well as why the risks are higher for veterans, trauma survivors, members of the LGBT\u0026#43; community, and health care professionals. Dr Andy Thomson is a psychiatrist at University of Virginia Student Health Services. The 9/11 attacks triggered an interest in suicide terrorism, which led to the discovery of an unappreciated world of research into how and why human minds generate religious beliefs. Andy has written \u201CWhy We Believe In God(s): A Concise Guide to the Science of Faith\u201D which brings that world to anyone interested.

      "description": "Healthy relationships, including family, friendships, partnerships, coworkers, and leader/subordinate relationships, can be difficult to maintain in the best of situations. It becomes impossible, however, when one person in the relationship is committed to behaviors that are coercive, deceptive, destructive, and/or self-serving. These unhealthy traits sometimes show up in two pathological ways: narcissism and psychopathy. While these personality traits are not nearly as common as experience, TV shows, movies, and the internet would have you believe, there\u2019s still plenty of signs to keep an eye out for. In this RfRx, we\u2019ll explore those traits and ways to reduce the influence that people with those traits may have on you. As an educator and trainer for health providers and other professionals, David Teachout also has a private practice helping adults and couples with learning resiliency skills related to relationship difficulties and trauma. He maintains a podcast, \u201CHumanity\u2019s Values,\u201D and a blog related to mental health topics. David has worked in mental health care for 15 years, and holds a master\u2019s in both forensic and counseling psychology, as well as currently working towards a PsyD in Clinical Psychology. He\u2019s also worked in community mental health, social work, criminal justice, elder care, and child advocacy.

      "description": "Transitioning out of religion isn\u2019t easy. Many of us have built our personal identity around our religious worldview and community, but what to do when that\u2019s gone or slipping away? We may be left feeling perplexed, confused, depressed and anxious in the aftermath of departing long held faith practices. This RfRx discussion will focus on strategies to rebuild a sense of self and self worth after one\u2019s religious identity is stripped away, as well as making rational decisions about unhealthy behaviors in contrast with sin consciousness. Ferron P. Wiley is an author, public speaker, and podcast host with a unique and wry sense of humor. He has twenty-plus years in the mental health industry working with children adolescents and adults. Having also served ten years presiding as Founder and Senior Pastor of a radically inclusive non-denominational church, he has been afforded a wide range of experiences and insight across the spectrum of humanity. Since recently leaving the Christian faith his core objective is to encourage people who perhaps are not well connected to their own personal value, help them to establish that as a foundation and to learn strategies to use that value as a springboard for pursuing happier and more productive lives. Exposing Sexual Abuse of Children in the Evangelical Church Author Ferron P. Wiley shares his traumatic experience in public talks and his \u0027Memoirs of Innocence Lost\u0027 book series. Growing up in the Christian church should provide guidance and spiritual enrichment, not abuse or shameful secrets. Author Ferron P. Wiley is finally telling his traumatic story of abuse and betrayal in the Christian church in order to help others in similar situations. Tabernacle of Lies, the first book in the Memoirs of Innocence Lost series which recounts the story of Ferron\u0027s upbringing in Rochester, New York, and his introduction to Christian faith traditions. Additionally, this was in the mid-1980s during the rise of American televangelism networks like PTL with Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker. Against this backdrop, young Wiley endured censure from the pulpit because of his homosexuality \u2013 all while being sexually abused by the same ministers privately. Surrounded by hypocrisy, Wiley shares his struggle with organized religion and self-affirmation. His passion for music and performance provides an outlet for self-expression.

      "description": "Rebuilding our identity after divorcing religion can feel like a daunting task. At some point, we must determine our post-religious values and confront identities which were placed on us by our parents and religious community. Once we have established who we are not, it is time to consider whom we wish to be and take steps in that direction. At this point, you must call upon the courage to be yourself, which has ramifications in every imaginable arena, from sexuality to social media. Janice Selbie, RPC joins us once again to share tips on coping with leaving our past identity behind and finding the courage to rebuild our new identities after transitioning out of religion. Janice was born and raised in a charismatic Christian home, attending Pentecostal, Vineyard, and other Evangelical churches before eventually marrying a man who would become a pastor. In her 30s she became ultraconservative, donning a head-covering, homeschooling their children, and rejecting any vestiges of secular life (TV, radio, music, newspapers, magazines, etc.). \u201CI referred to myself as \u2018Mennocostal,\u2019 frequently attending closed Mennonite churches run by the Holdeman Mennonites.\u201D It wasn\u2019t until her 40s that Janice began experiencing doubts about her deeply held faith. As her marriage unraveled, her questions grew. She found herself wondering about the impact of religion on sexuality, gender roles and equality, social justice, and more. \u201CNot permitted to explore these questions, I felt like a beach ball held beneath the water for too long. My sadness, confusion, and anger threatened to explode if something didn\u0027t change.\u201D After ending her decades-long marriage, Janice went back to school to attain her Diploma of Applied Psychology and Counselling.

      "description": "Explore what it means to be \u0022spiritual\u0022 or live meaningfully without the outmoded accessories of religious trappings. Rachel Roberts will offer definitions of terms that illustrate how ancient human inclinations, such as spirituality, are still relevant but need to be recontextualized in the 21st century. She will also provide examples and ideas for nonreligious meaning-making traditions and rituals that can enhance everyday living and the overarching life journey. Being connected to something greater than ourselves, whether it\u0027s community, love, nature, or any other value, is the epicenter of secular spirituality. Rachel Roberts is the author of Confessions of an American None: A Credo of Sorts. The study of religion has been her passion since young adulthood. She has a bachelor\u0027s degree with an emphasis on philosophy of religion, and a masters degree in Theological Studies from Southern Methodist University. She grew up in a Christian cult with her mother, yet her father was an atheist. After an on-again, off-again relationship with Christianity as an adult, Rachel found her truth and freedom in coming out as a non-believer. Rachel has three children, a dog named Tito, and a cat named Strudel. Her guilty pleasures include gummy bears, a crisp IPA, and Star Trek.

      "description": "In the United States, laws have been created and upheld which favor religious freedoms over the health and well-being of United States citizens. In this RfRx, Torah Bontrager will return to discuss the supremacy of religious rights over other basic human rights, including education (a theme of the Amish Heritage Foundation\u2019s work and the topic of their upcoming conference). A report by the Columbia Law School\u0027s Law, Rights, and Religion Project shows that \u0022the Supreme Court\u2019s COVID-era opinions have created a hierarchy of constitutional rights, with religious rights at the top.\u0022 This discussion will cover how this happened, how this affects everyday people, where we are headed, and what we can do about it. Torah Bontrager escaped in the middle of the night at age 15 so she could go to high school. She\u2019s the author of Amish Girl in Manhattan and, to her knowledge, the first female Amish escapee to graduate from the Ivy League. Her story\u2019s been featured on MTV and Forbes.com, among others. Today, she advocates for the right of Amish children to go to school beyond the 8th grade. Torah founded The Amish Heritage Foundation, which focuses on making education a federal right and overturning the Supreme Court case Wisconsin v. Yoder.

      "description": "If you grew up in a deeply religious household, were homeschooled or went to a religious school, you might have been given some serious disinformation about American history. Christian Nationalism has demanded the creation of myths and the revision of history. In this RfRx discussion Andrew Seidel will discuss what it is, the role it plays in society now and historically, how to spot it, and how to fight it. This discussion is based off of his bestselling book The Founding Myth. Andrew L. Seidel is a constitutional and civil rights attorney, activist, and former Grand Canyon tour guide. He has a B.S. in neuroscience and a few law degrees, each with academic honors and awards. His first book, The Founding Myth: Why Christian Nationalism is Un-American , ended the debate about whether America was founded as a Christian nation or not. As Andrew likes to say: At the Freedom From Religion Foundation , Andrew works to ensure that the government officials don\u2019t use offices and power that belong to \u201CWe the people\u201D to promote their personal religion. He has appeared on outlets from MSNBC to Fox News and his writing has been featured in Slate, ThinkProgress, Religion Dispatches, Religion News Service, The Hill, Irish Central, the Cap Times, the Salt Lake Tribune, the Austin-American Statesman, the Oklahoman, Forbes, Rewire News, and scholarly journals. When not litigating cases or standing up for freethinkers\u2019 rights at FFRF travels the country discussing American history, the Constitution, religion, the law, his book, religious freedom, and why America needs a secular revival.

      "description": "There is safety in religious beliefs such as rules to follow, clear consequences, and structured relationships. When we step out of our religion into the big wide world, it\u2019s a struggle to release the rules, to ignore the dogma we\u2019ve been raised to trust. June has learned to recognize that rules-based voice, challenge it and embrace life without the safety net of religion \u2014 mostly!

      "description": "Dave Warnock is a former conservative Evangelical pastor and church leader of 40 years, who began to question, examine and investigate his Evangelical Christianity faith claims 10 years ago. He came to the conclusion that those beliefs came up short and it took him several years to work through how to live without belief. He realized that this was his one life and there was nothing after. His motto became \u201CCarpe the Fucking Diem\u201D and he began living his best life. In 2019 Dave Warnock was diagnosed with ALS, a neurodegenerative and terminal disease, for which there is currently no cure. He now spends the time he has left traveling and speaking about seizing the moments in our lives and approaching death as an atheist. Join us as we dig deep into this story and hear how he\u2019s navigating death with no fear of hell or promise of heaven.

      "description": "Substance and alcohol abuse is so prevalent around the world that very few people have not succumbed to its temptation or know someone who has. There is substantial evidence that we and our ancient relatives used substances as antimicrobials and antiparasitic agents. A byproduct was these substances\u0027 ability to disable our prefrontal cortex, inhibit our inner chimp and stimulate our inner bee, to become the ultra social, eusocial organism that we are. Substances provide some of the same benefits as religion, helping to bind genetic strangers together and not teaching evolution impairs the understanding of this phenomena. Dr Andy Thomson is a psychiatrist at University of Virginia Student Health Services. The 9/11 attacks triggered an interest in suicide terrorism, which led to the discovery of an unappreciated world of research into how and why human minds generate religious beliefs. Andy has written \u201CWhy We Believe In God(s): A Concise Guide to the Science of Faith\u201D which brings that world to anyone interested.

      "description": "American Atheists is a national civil rights organization that works to achieve religious equality for all Americans by protecting what Thomas Jefferson called the \u201Cwall of separation\u201D between government and religion created by the First Amendment. They strive to create an environment where atheism and atheists are accepted as members of our nation\u2019s communities and where casual bigotry against our community is seen as abhorrent and unacceptable. They promote understanding of atheists through education, outreach, and community-building and work to end the stigma associated with being an atheist in America. Sam McGuire has a varied background in counseling, education, event planning and volunteer management. As National Field Director, she works with local grassroots activists, volunteers and affiliates to help them engage on emerging local civil rights issues, advocate for state level legislation, and build thriving communities.

      "description": "As an offshoot of the Mennonites, the Amish have been around since the 17th century and are well known for their public-facing quaint and austere lives. However, along with their historical and religious cousins, the Mennonites and other Anabaptists, those who are on the inside know it\u0027s not at all an idyllic life within these isolated religious communities. In this RfRx talk, we\u0027ll discuss what the Amish believe and how it\u0027s shaped their communities and activities; how it\u0027s different from other Christian belief systems; the difference between the Amish and Mennonite beliefs; and the harm that can come from these beliefs, specially when it comes to education and integrating into the modern world around them. Torah Bontrager escaped in the middle of the night at age 15 so she could go to high school. She\u2019s the author of Amish Girl in Manhattan and, to her knowledge, the first female Amish escapee to graduate from the Ivy League. Her story\u2019s been featured on MTV and Forbes.com, among others. Today, she advocates for the right of Amish children to go to school beyond the 8th grade. Torah founded The Amish Heritage Foundation, which focuses on making education a federal right and overturning the Supreme Court case Wisconsin v. Yoder.

His broader aim is to ground our understanding of feeling and thought in the facts of biology. Dr. Reimers was raised Christian but found a path to humanism in his twenties. Since then he has been a humanist leader and speaker for over a decade in Virginia and now in Michigan.

      "description": "During the decade when Evangelicalism was coalescing with politics, a homegrown cult, known as the Shepherding Movement, reached its zenith. A religious pyramid scheme that bilked people of their money, identity, and freedom quietly penetrated the Southern United States. Rachel Roberts escaped the cult and the 80s, and fortunately outgrew both, just like her teenage bad perm. Rachel Roberts founded American None\u2122, the first organization of its kind to serve the fastest-growing (non)religious demographic in our country\u2013 the Nones. She is the author of \u201CConfessions of an American None: A Credo of Sorts\u201D. Rachel is deeply motivated to help elevate the soul of our nation and believes that collectively Nones harness a vast power to do so. The study of religion has been her passion since young adulthood. She has a bachelor\u0027s degree with an emphasis on philosophy of religion, and a masters degree in Theological Studies from Southern Methodist University. She grew up in a Christian cult with her mother, yet her father was an atheist. After an on-again, off-again relationship with Christianity as an adult, Rachel found her truth and freedom in coming out as a None. Rachel has three children, a dog named Tito, and a cat named Strudel. Her guilty pleasures include gummy bears, a crisp IPA, and Star Trek.

      "description": "Everyone grieves in their own way and according to their own timeframe, the accepted wisdom tells us. But those in mourning rarely find comfort in knowing this and those looking to support someone in mourning can do little with this advice, leaving them with a sense of helplessness. As a mental health professional and someone who has dealt with her own share of personal grief, Candace R. M. Gorham understands well the quest for relief. The truth of the matter, she says, is there is no one way to grieve, but there are things that are important to pay attention to while mourning. While much of the advice she shares is universal, she pays particular attention to the struggle those who do not believe in a god or afterlife face with the loss of a loved one\u2014and offers practical, life-affirming steps for them to remember and heal. Candace R. M. Gorham MA, LPCS is a licensed professional mental health counselor. She is a former ordained minister turned atheist-humanist activist, researcher, and writer on issues related to race and religion. She is a member of the Black Humanist Alliance advisory board, The Secular Therapist Project, and The Clergy Project.

      "description": "A foundational piece of fundamentalist thinking is black/white, us vs them, view of the world. Often, even having left the structure of religion behind, we still maintain that either/or worldview. In this RfRx discussion, David will work through why this is still so enticing, even without a god, and how to expand beyond it when engaging with other people in dialogue and with ourselves in self-evaluation. As an educator and trainer for health providers and other professionals, David Teachout also has a private practice helping adults and couples with learning resiliency skills related to relationship difficulties and trauma. He maintains a podcast, \u201CHumanity\u2019s Values,\u201D and a blog related to mental health topics. David has worked in mental health care for 15 years, and holds a master\u2019s in both forensic and counseling psychology, as well as currently working towards a PsyD in Clinical Psychology. He\u2019s also worked in community mental health, social work, criminal justice, elder care, and child advocacy.

      "description": "Our brains evolved on the African savannah well enough to allow Homo Sapiens to survive in that harsh, unforgiving environment, and go on to populate the planet. But the thinking organ which developed to prevent our death at the hands of predators and the elements is far from perfect. We are primed to trust the opinions and anecdotes of those in our close circle, and the pronouncements of those in authority. We conclude that something is true based on inadequate personal experience, less-than-perfect memory, faulty logic, and a host of cognitive biases. These tendencies can lead us to believe in things which do not comport with reality, and often lead to bad decisions, and even harm. In this talk, Rob Palmer will discuss these topics from a skeptical perspective, because understanding our innate cognitive failings can help us all think more rationally, better avoid errors, and hopefully live better lives. Rob Palmer is a skeptical activist who works to educate the public about critical thinking by contributing to Wikipedia as part of The Guerrilla Skepticism on Wikipedia project (GSoW), and by writing for Skeptical Inquirer as The Well-Known Skeptic. His column covers contemporary skeptical issues, and he has interviewed conference speakers, podcasters, YouTubers, scientists, activists, and TV personalities as diverse as Cosmos producer/writer Ann Druyan, Thomas Westbrook (Holy Koolaid), Seth Andrews (The Thinking Atheist), and actor/activist John de Lance (Q of Star Trek).

Additionally, the presentation will discuss a useful model known as the \u201CAAA battery\u201D: Agency, Attachment, and Altruism. Dr Andy Thomson is a psychiatrist at University of Virginia Student Health Services. The 9/11 attacks triggered an interest in suicide terrorism, which led to the discovery of an unappreciated world of research into how and why human minds generate religious beliefs. Andy has written \u201CWhy We Believe In God(s): A Concise Guide to the Science of Faith\u201D which brings that world to anyone interested.

      "description": "In many Muslim majority countries doubting Islamic teachings, leaving the faith, or same-sex love can result in harsh punishments, ostratization, toture or even execution. As you might imagine, these repercussions result in fear and deep psychological trauma. In this RfRx discussion, Yasmine Mohammend will share with us how the nonprofit organization Free Hearts Free Minds is working to offer mental health support for these people. Free Hearts refers to supporting members of the LGBT community and Free Minds refers to supporting freethinkers who choose to denounce the religion they were born into. Yasmine Mohammed is a Canadian author and human rights activist advocating for the rights of women living within Islamic majority countries, as well as those who struggle under religious fundamentalism. She is the founder of Free Hearts Free Minds, an organization that provides psychological support for freethinkers living within Muslim majority countries, where the state sanctioned punishment for leaving Islam is death.

      "description": "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (also known as Mormonism) is a relative newcomer to the religion scene having been around for less than 200 years having been born out of violence and deceit. Over that time it has predictably adapted to changing social views and failed prophecies. In this RfRx Shannon Grover and Bryce Blankenagel will discuss LDS history and dogma as well as the unique challenges people face when leaving this faith behind. Shannon Grover was born and raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and was a model Mormon. She went to church, held callings, went on a mission, married in the temple, stayed home, and stuffed all of her doubts into a locked closet. Five years ago, when the closet was so full the door broke, she finally faced reality and walked away. Now she is the co-host of the Glass Box Podcast with Bryce Blankenagel, while she works to break free of the conditioning the church imposed on her. Bryce Blankenagel was also born and raised in the LDS church and was also a model Mormon. However as a teenager he became less and less satisfied with the answers to the questions he asked his elders. At the age of 17 he stopped attending church and began to examine the religion he was born into. Bryce is the co-host of the Glass Box Podcast as well as the host of the Naked Mormonism podcast.

      "description": "Professional clergy\u201D such as pastors, priests, ministers, rabbis, and imams, face some unique challenges when transitioning out of religion. Their livelihood relies on leading their flock, but when their faith is gone, they may be \u201Cstuck in the pulpit\u201D usually without the skills or connections to simply walk away. Charles, Hill, former minister and current Communications Director for The Clergy Project, will discuss the unique challenges faced by these professional clergy who no longer believe what they\u2019re preaching and how The Clergy Project provides a safe, supportive landing space for them to share and discuss their loss of faith, family, career livelihoods, divorce, mental health and even suicide. Charles Hill was raised in an Evangelical Christian home. After a 4 year career with the Columbus, OH Police Dept, he had an experience which led him to leave that career behind to enter full-time ministry. Charles and his wife started several successful churches, preached multiple times every weekend to locations around the world, and were well-known Christian conference speakers just before their theological world came crashing down. Following their deconversion they lost income, family, friends and community. He has been an RfR support group leader since 2014, as well as being the Communications Director and a Board Member for The Clergy Project. Charles and his wife, Tiffany, have been married for 25 years and have 3 amazing children. Towards the end of the show, former nun and current Clergy Project screener, Maureen Hart joined in on the discussion.

      "description": "Because most fundamentalist religions are such high demand belief-systems, when it\u2019s suddenly gone, it can be a very disorienting, confusing and painful time in someone\u0027s life. One can find themselves, as Katherine Roberts did, with a shaken worldview and lost without the underpinnings of their old faith. Gleaning from her own journey out of faith, and looking back at the challenges that she faced, Katherine will offer practical advice to those finding themselves sitting amongst the ruins of their former faith, wondering where to start to rebuild in a healthy way. Katherine Roberts spent nearly 25 years as an evangelical, fundamental Christian, most of those years being in some form of ministry and eventually became ordained pastor. In 2018, after a long period of deconstructing from fundamentalist beliefs, she made a skeptical examination of the evidence for the existence of God, and today, she calls herself an atheist and a freethinker. Hosted by Eric Wells, the RfR Support Group Director and Kara Griffin, RfR Helpline Agent. Recorded on July 19, 2021 Atheist Community of Discord: https://discord.com/invite/B28xRKb The primary focus of Recovering from Religion (RfR) is to offer hope, healing, and support to those struggling with issues of doubt and non-belief. This transitional period is an ongoing process that can result in a range of emotions, as well as a ripple effect of consequences throughout an individual\u2019s life.

      "description": "All the major world religions, both Eastern and Western, share more in common than most people realize - and often share the same skeletons in their closets. In this RfRx David will discuss patterns in the ways the concept of gods and God changes over millennia. Drawing upon the scholarship of many historians and social science disciplines, he\u0027ll trace out how religious ideas originated and evolved from prehistory to the ancient world to the modern day - and the most surprising discoveries underlying all our religions, even today. David Fitzgerald is an award-winning author, historical researcher, international public speaker, and long-time passionate atheist activist. In a career spanning over 20 years, he has worked for or with the Secular Student Alliance, American Atheists, Center for Inquiry, Camp Quest West, American Humanist Association, (and RfR!) and several other freethought organizations, conferences and secular events. Hosted by Eric Wells, the RfR Support Group Director and Sherrie D\u2019Souza, RfR Board Member and Support Group Leader.

      "description": "In On the Origin of Species Charles Darwin wrote, \u201CPain or suffering of any kind, if long continued, causes depression and lessens the power of action; yet is well adapted to make a creature guard itself against any great or sudden evil.\u201D One hundred and sixty years later we have solid theories supported by evidence that depression\u2019s core structure arises from an adaptation, not a broken or dysfunctional brain. Andy Thomson is a psychiatrist at University of Virginia Student Health Services. The 9.11 attacks triggered an interest in suicide terrorism, which led to the discovery of an unappreciated world of research into how and why human minds generate religious beliefs. Andy has written \u201CWhy We Believe In God(s): A Concise Guide to the Science of Faith\u201D which brings that world to anyone interested.

      "description": "Over the past several decades there has been a rise of Christian Nationalism in the United States. In this RfRx discussion, Seth will discuss the power that the Christian Nationalist movement currently wields, and how they use it. He will be exploring the way this ideology has been sold to the masses and injected into government, despite church state separation. There is a privilege to this movement that makes it unique. Christian Nationalists wield money, power, and a belief that they are the chosen ones. Seth will shed light on this privileged position and highlight how fear of the \u201Cother\u201D is used both as a motivator and a selling point to forward the Christian Nationalists\u0027 cause as their numbers are dwindling and the secular population is growing. Seth Andrews, a video producer and former Christian broadcaster, now hosts The Thinking Atheist, one of the most popular online atheist communities and podcasts in the world. The Thinking Atheist is not a person, it\u0027s an icon encouraging all to reject faith and pursue reason and evidence. Seth has authored several books: \u0022Deconverted,\u0022 \u0022Sacred Cows,\u0022 \u0022Ghost Stories,\u0022 and \u0022Confessions of a Former Fox News Christian\u0022. He also hosts The Thinking Atheist podcast on Spreaker, a broadcast that has been downloaded over 50 million times since its launch in 2010.

      "description": "A surprisingly high percent of people believe in \u0022psychics\u0022 and \u0022mediums\u0022 (those claiming to see the future \u0026 communicate with the dead). Unfortunately, having supernatural beliefs inherent in being religious influences people to believe this at a rate over 5 times higher than atheists do. This leaves them open to psychological and financial devastation at the hands of con-artists. In this talk, Rob will reveal how psychics and mediums manipulate people into believing they have special abilities (on TV and in person), and explain why science says that these paranormal claims are untrue. He will present details about believers defrauded of enormous sums (up to their entire life savings), and he will explain how the legal system is not on your side if you become a victim. Rob is a skeptical activist who writes for Skeptical Inquirer as The Well-Known Skeptic. He writes about contemporary skeptical issues, and has interviewed conference speakers, scientists, TV personalities, and skeptical and atheist activists. Rob takes a special interest in combating the dangerous belief in psychics and mediums, and he educates the public about the harm that often befalls vulnerable victims who trust in people claiming these abilities.

      "description": "Religions teach nothing about actual sexuality, biology and why our bodies work as they do. In this talk Dr. Ray will be discussing some basic facts about sex, evolution and human sexuality, like why is the penis shaped as it is? What is it with all those sperm males produce? What is sexual dimorphism? Are we chimps, gorillas or bonobos? We breed cows, chickens and other animals, could we be breeding ourselves as well? Learning the science of sex can help you make your own decisions about your sexuality and help you throw away the 3,000 year old ideas found in religious indoctrination. Trigger warning: This discussion contains images of genetalia and acknowledges the existence of sex. Dr Darrel Ray is the Founder \u0026 President of Recovering from Religion. He has been a psychologist for over thirty years and is the author of four books: including \u0022The God Virus-How Religion Infects Our Lives and Culture\u0022 and \u0022Sex and God-How Religion Distorts Sexuality\u0022. Dr. Ray has been a student of religion most of his life and holds a Masters Degree in religion as well as a Bachelor\u0027s Degree in Sociology/Anthropology with a Doctorate in Psychology.

      "description": "*Trigger Warning - talk of suicide This discussion explores the religious community\u2019s attempt to \u201Cfix\u201D and change sexual orientations other than heterosexual, now known as Conversion Therapy, previously known as \u201Cex-gay\u201D treatments. The methodology varies, but the practice has been thoroughly debunked. Bill Prickett speaks about his personal experience, his rise as a leader in the conversion therapy community, and the harms it causes. Bill Prickett was born and raised in Birmingham, Alabama, the \u0022Bible Belt\u0022 of the Deep South. In early college, after a religious conversion, he decided to pursue a career in the ministry. He served more than five years in youth ministry, eleven years as Pastor of a Southern Baptist Church, and four years as Pastor of an independent, evangelical congregation. To comply with the teachings of his conservative Christian faith, Bill spent more than eight years trying to change his sexual orientation. Eventually, he became Executive Director of an \u0022ex-gay\u0022 ministry, working with others who also struggled with homosexuality. Since abandoning those futile efforts, he has spent decades speaking out about the deception and dangers of programs now known as Conversion Therapy.

      "description": "A religious identity is more than a label put on for church services. It is a way of seeing yourself, your relationships, and the world around you in a structured ethical way. Everything potentially has meaning at a cosmic level. Losing that sense of structure can be devastating. Here we\u2019re going to look at why you don\u2019t have to give up your Values, even the ones you had before, and consider how to build meaning/purpose/ethics into your life without cosmic interruption. David Teachout, LMHC is a licensed mental health counselor who grew up in Michigan, home of taking the first day of hunting season off from school, and went to a bible college in my then quest to become a minister for Christianity. Questions ensued, answers were not forthcoming, and the result is a life of studying humanity from a place of curiosity rather than condemnation. David currently resides in the Seattle area, with a career almost entirely focused on psychology and possess a sometimes frustrating desire to pursue complicated conversations Hosted by Amaia Perez, the RfR Online Programming Director, and Eric Wells, the RfR Support Group Director.

      "description": "In this RfRx session Taylor will discuss what Multi Level Marketing (pyramid schemes) are, the risks and statistics involved with MLMs, who they prey on, and how to avoid falling into one. Also, she will discuss how to deal with a family member or friend who has become involved with an MLM. MLMs disproportionately target religious people, and many of us who have left/are leaving religion likely know someone who is in an MLM. Taylor is passionate about educating the public on the dangers and predatory nature of multi-level marketing companies. MLMs target vulnerable individuals and attempt to sell them on an unachievable dream life. She runs the YouTube channel \u201CThe Antibot\u201D - in her videos she debunks claims made by MLMs and their distributors using reputable, peer-reviewed sources. More than anything, Taylor wants to help build a world where women are truly empowered through legitimate small business ownership and entrepreneurship, and to stop the cashflow to multi-billion dollar companies that prey on and exploit the very demographic they claim to empower.

      "description": "Premiered Jan 20, 2021 Dr. Darrel Ray returns to RfRx to tell us about \u201CReligious Trauma, Its Roots and Its Treatments.\u201D Religious abuse is the root of religious trauma and often goes unrecognized by therapists and clients alike. Children raised in toxic environments do not know it is toxic; it just seems normal to them. When they experience symptoms later in life, failure to identify the root cause leads to inappropriate treatments. Appropriate identification and treatment can often lead to rapid improvement and positive outcomes. Misidentification can lead to years of frustration and inappropriate treatment. Dr. Ray is the founder and President of the Board of Directors of Recovering from Religion. He has been a psychologist for over thirty years and is the author of four books: two on organizational teamwork as well as \u0022The God Virus-How Religion Infects Our Lives and Culture\u0022 and \u0022Sex and God-How Religion Distorts Sexuality\u0022.

Focus on character traits. - Contrasting Views Exercise: Write down former views about yourself, futures, others, sex, etc, then compare them to your current views on the same topic. - Examining Beliefs Exercise: Examine beliefs on how you view yourself and how you view others.

      "description": "In this RfRx session we hear Itto Outini\u2019s story about coming out of Islam and her struggles and successes after becoming disabled. We explore how religious organizations treat disabled communities and what we could all do as a society to change the manner in which disabled communities are treated. We also discuss value, acceptance and tolerance towards minorities, such as disabled non-believers. Itto Outini was born and raised in Morocco by a Jewish father and Muslim mother. Both parents died and she was raised by different family members. She did not attend school until the age of seventeen as she was viewed as nothing but a slave to her family. She was stabbed by her uncle\u2019s wife at the age of seventeen and lost her sight, family, and was left homeless in the streets of Morocco. She began school at the age of seventeen for the first time. Graduated high school and went to the university where she was awarded the Fulbright Scholarship to study a Master\u2019s degree in Journalism in the United States. After graduating with her Master\u2019s she was approved for asylum to stay in the United States. She is now a journalist, a human rights activist, accessibility advocate, and atheist. During the discussion you may hear a voice in the background and that would be Itto\u2019s assistant, Amy.

While we have been able to Divorce Religion, we remain vulnerable to the trap of rigid, authoritarian thinking in all spheres. This module of the Divorcing Religion Workshop explores the fusion of identity with beliefs and how we can avoid it. As a registered professional counselor with a personal history of religious trauma syndrome, Janice is passionate about helping others understand their losses and embrace their new identity in the secular world. Her own deconversion experience compelled her to develop the on-line Divorcing Religion Workshop, a 6-week interactive workshop combining written exercises and group work to bring together those from diverse backgrounds who are walking a similar journey.

      "description": "The future of our society rests in many ways on how the ongoing challenge of racial injustice in the country is addressed. We also may not understand how racism affects the mental health and overall perspectives of people leaving religion. Yet, atheists/humanists remain divided over what, if anything, should guide humanist thought and actions toward matters of racial and other societal injustices. It is important that the secular community knows that critical thinking, education, and recovery includes addressing, understanding and undoing other societal problems as well. Mandisa Thomas is the Founder and President of Black Nonbelievers. She currently serves on the Boards for American Atheists and the American Humanist Association, and facilitates the Morrow, GA chapter of Recovering from Religion. In 2019, Mandisa was named the Freedom From Religion Foundation\u2019s Freethought Heroine, and was the recipient of the Secular Student Alliance\u2019s Backbone Award. Candace R. M. Gorham MA, LPCS is a licensed professional mental health counselor. She is a former ordained minister turned atheist-humanist activist, researcher, and writer on issues related to race and religion. She is a member of the Black Humanist Alliance advisory board, The Secular Therapist Project, and The Clergy Project.

      "description": "Have you ever struggled setting boundaries? Do you always feel like you have to please people over your own needs? Religion of all types has a tendency to tell you what you can and can\u2019t do with your own body and thoughts. Coming out of religion one can begin to recognize that there is no longer a need to operate as if still under that old control. In this discussion, we will gain an understanding of our own autonomy, what it is, what we have autonomy over, how to establish boundaries, and how to seek consent, in addition to how to advocate for the autonomy of others. Marie D\u2019Elephant is a former evangelical missionary to Mexico, now an agnostic-atheist, secular humanist, and activist. She hosts the Everyone\u2019s Autonomous Podcast, discussing themes of autonomy through a post-religion lens and the process of reintegration into the world now that we\u2019re just apes. Marie is also a photographer with a humanist twist as well as a life coach with a specialty in ethical non-monogamy.

      "description": "Experiencing abuse is already difficult, yet it can be made more so when systems in place to support your growth are themselves the source of the abuse. The social relationship embodied as religious ideology is powerful because it connects us to one another, and provides a structure for meaning/purpose and ethics for one\u2019s life. We\u2019ll look at how this structure can be and is used to undermine the building of self-worth, perpetuating a moral injury form of abuse, and how to move through and beyond it with resiliency. As an educator and trainer for health providers and other professionals, David Teachout also has a private practice helping adults and couples with learning resiliency skills related to relationship difficulties and trauma. He maintains a podcast, \u201CHumanity\u2019s Values,\u201D and a blog related to mental health topics. David has worked in mental health care for 15 years, and holds a master\u2019s in both forensic and counseling psychology, as well as currently working towards a PsyD in Clinical Psychology.

      "description": "The history of Christianity is a combination of individual struggles, institutional power and the profoundly human desire to find an answer to existence. The tension we all experience in the search for that answer is between the singularity of fundamentalism and the pluralism of a world that is so much bigger than any single perspective can hope to hold. We\u2019ll be looking at Christianity as a whole through a lens of motivated reasoning and that human tendency to prefer a single path to truth. David grew up in Michigan, home of taking the first day of hunting season off from school, and went to a bible college in my then quest to become a minister for Christianity. Questions ensued, answers were not forthcoming, and the result is a life of studying humanity from a place of curiosity rather than condemnation.

Brian is a 5-year volunteer with Recovering from Religion serving in various ways including Helpline Agent, Resource Curator, Volunteer Interviewer, and RfR Support Group Facilitator in Nashville. Brian has also volunteered for 5 years with SMART Recovery as a Support Group Facilitator and Tennessee Regional Coordinator. Thes volunteer roles at RfR and SMART are peer support and Brian is not a professional expert in either area. As a trained and experienced meeting facilitator, however, Brian will lead a mock SMART Recovery meeting with vigorous discussion although without giving professional advice.

      "description": "The beliefs we grow up with go way beyond the question of whether there is a god. Religious ideology insinuates itself into every aspect of our thoughts and beliefs. It takes a lifetime of deliberate vigilance to identify and root out the myriad ways religious indoctrination misinforms reality. Nate Phelps was born into the fundamentalist Westboro Baptist Church. After years of extreme indoctrination and physical violence he ran away from home on his 18th birthday. Over the next 40 years he journeyed from abject terror of god\u2019s judgment to finally rejecting the god of his upbringing. Over the past decade he has worked with a number of organizations, including Recovering from Religion, to push back against the destructive elements of faithful ideologies.

      "description": "Religions teach a lot of harmful ideas about our bodies and sexuality, none of which are based in biology or even reality. Coming out of religion, many people experience difficulty with knowing who they are sexually. Some people have experienced trauma around their sexuality and have deep doubts rooted in Purity Culture. Most people need to learn new ideas, skills and may need therapy to overcome past abuse - both physical and psychological. Dr. Ray will talk about ways to identify roadblocks to accepting your sexuality and learning to thrive as a sexual being. Dr Darrel Ray is the Founder \u0026 President of Recovering from Religion. He has been a psychologist for over thirty years and is the author of four books: including \u0022The God Virus-How Religion Infects Our Lives and Culture\u0022 and \u0022Sex and God-How Religion Distorts Sexuality\u0022.

Dave Warnock is a former conservative Evangelical pastor and church leader of 40 years. 10 years ago he began to question, examine and investigate his evangelical Christianity faith claims. He came to the conclusion that those beliefs came up short and it took him several years to work through how to live without belief. He realized that this was his one life and there was nothing after. His motto became \u201CCarpe Diem\u201D and he began living his best life. Following a fatal diagnosis of ALS in February 2019, his motto has been turbo charged.

      "description": "In the 1980\u2019s and 90\u2019s, sexual \u201Cpurity\u201D became a major focus in sectors of Christian culture within the United States. This movement, now referred to as \u201Cpurity culture,\u201D had detrimental effects, including stunted LGBTQI\u0026#43; identity exploration, dissociation from one\u2019s body, under-reported sexual assaults, and relationship struggles. Join us as we explore specific concepts taught within purity culture, its impacts \u0026 developmental trauma, as well as tips and resources for identifying the trauma in oneself and working through it. Content warning: This discussion will have a lot of heteronormitive language and heavy gendered language. We understand that can be triggering \u0026 stressful, but know it\u2019s intentional because it\u2019s a part of breaking down the core concepts of purity culture. This discussion was held in the beginning of Pride Month and purity culture is especially damaging to the LGBTQ\u0026#43; community. Christy Lanterman, LPC counsels couples and adult individuals recovering from religious trauma. She focused her graduate studies on how religious trauma (RT) occurs, religious abuse, how to identify controlling groups/people, and how folks can recover from RT. She is passionate about supporting her clients in their healing process. Hosted by Eric Wells, the RfR Support Group Director, and Kara Griffin, RfR Helpline Agent.

      "description": "Janice was born and raised in a charismatic Christian home, attending Pentecostal, Vineyard, and other evangelical churches before eventually marrying a pastor. She gravitated to the ultra-conservative side of her theology, wearing a head covering, insisting on homeschooling her children, and rejecting any vestiges of secular life. (e.g., TV, radio, music, newspapers, magazines, etc.) Then, in her 40s, she began having doubts about her faith. As the questions grew, her marriage unraveled. To rebuild her life, Janice went back to school to earn her Diploma of Applied Psychology and Counseling. Janice has taken her own experiences and developed the Divorcing Religion Workshop to provide tools for others with their journey out of fundamentalist religion.

He gradually moved away from Christianity, which came at a huge personal cost, including the breakup of his marriage, being shunned by two of his children, missing out on his grandchildren, and the loss of his entire community of friends. Earlier this year, Dave was diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease), and told he had three to five years to live. Suddenly, with the awareness that life is incredibly brief, his life became infinitely more precious. Instead of succumbing to the depression, anger, and hopelessness, he decided to begin living life to the fullest.

He received his Ph.D. from Yale, where he was named a Whiting Fellow, Yale\u0027s highest recognition for research in the humanities. He was also trained in social scientific theory and methods at the University of Chicago (M.A.), theology and divinity at Trinity International University (M.Div.), and religious studies at Pomona College (B.A.). Devin has a rich and diverse ethnic and theological background, and says his study of religion was a way of making sense of his upbringing and the complexities of the world he encountered, and to help others see, appreciate, and navigate the nuance and complexities of life together on this planet. He is motivated to further mutual understanding, toleration, justice, and compassion--as well as meaningful and sustainable work, productivity, and value creation. In this episode, we talk about his book \u201CDivine Currency\u201D that delves into how economic ideas structured early Christian thought and society, giving crucial insight into why money holds such sway in the West. The book examines the religious and theological sources of money\u0027s power, it shows how early Christian thinkers borrowed ancient notions and metaphors of money and economic exchange from the Roman Empire as a basis for their new theological arguments.

First, we proudly introduce our new producer, Julian Apostata, and our engineer, Sarah Austin, then the four of us talk about gender non-conformity, and how our faith communities responded/reacted. That takes us to our informative interview with Donovan Ackley III, Ph.D., who was a professor at a conservative Evangelical Christian university. His decision to transition made national news, and ended his long-time position with the school. Donovan\u2019s doctorate is in philosophy of religion, and is the author of several books and many articles. For the past 6 years he\u0027s worked in trauma-informed crisis intervention, currently as case management team lead for a recovery residence with women and children recovering from addiction.

When she came back to America for college, it was culture shock on several levels, even though it was a Mormon school. There she began to discover her love and aptitude for singing. It was music that got her through the painful transition out of her Mormon faith. She\u0027s a songwriter and lead singer of the Angela Soffe Band. Her music has elements of folk, pop, and bluegrass. There\u0027s a darkness-to-light message in her music, and her voice is amazing. Her song, \u201CRocks\u201D won the Great American Songwriting Contest for 2018, and the \u0022Second Wind\u0022 album has been nominated for the Independent Music Awards (2018) In this episode she talks with us about leaving Mormonism and, throughout this episode, we include some of her music.

      "description": "Cults come in a variety of expressions, though they have commonalities. Our guest for this episode is an expert on this subject, as well as a former cult member herself. Dr. Janja Lalich is a researcher, author, and educator specializing in cults and extremist groups with a particular focus on charismatic relationships, political and other social movements, ideology, and social control. She was a Fulbright scholar and is Professor Emerita of Sociology at California State University, Chico, and the founder and former director of the Center for Research on Influence and Control. Her books are considered essential to understand the attraction of these groups. She presents four ways to not only explain the power of cults, but also the control they have over their followers. Her latest book is one of the most extensive examinations of those who\u2019ve left cults.
