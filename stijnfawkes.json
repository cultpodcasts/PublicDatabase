Join us for a raw and enlightening conversation that sheds light on the dark world of cults and the resilience of the human spirit.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout Isabella:\n\u0022Seventeen years ago, I escaped from a messianic cult after my son was murdered to prevent the cult leader (my ex-husband) from being exposed as a pedophile, rapist, and conman. Once I escaped, I focused on spending time in Nature, expanding my consciousness, healing emotional wounds, learning about cults and mind control, and freeing my mind from cult programming.\u0022\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nLinks:\nwww.feelingbetternaturally.love\nYouTube: Feeling Better Naturally\nSubstack: https://feelingbetternaturally.substack.com/\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nGreyhorn Pagans:\n- https://www.patreon.com/Greyhornpagans\n- https://www.greyhornpagans.com/\n- https://linktr.ee/firefae\n\nPodcast recorded with Riverside Studios:\n- https://www.riverside.fm/?via=stijnfawkes\n\nMusic from #Uppbeat (free for Creators!):\n- https://share.uppbeat.io/3sdb032die4g\n\nMusic used:\n- Intro: A Hero Is Born- Anuch (https://uppbeat.io/t/anuch/a-hero-is-born License code: CWRZTL9VLXMWQEMK)\n- Outro: Viking/Medieval Theme by M-Murray -- https://freesound.org/s/723202/ -- License: Attribution NonCommercial 4.0",
