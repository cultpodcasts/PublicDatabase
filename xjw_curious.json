      "description": "The JW cult is a religion founded by the Watchtower, Bible, and Tract Society of Pennsylvania in the late 19th century. While claiming their doctrines and beliefs are all Biblical, a simple examination proves quite the opposite on most issues. The religion is run by a group of men with no formal education in theology, psychology, or education. They call themselves the \u0022Governing Body\u0022, which is a term that comes from the corporate world, not the Bible. The Watchtower Corporation is a high-control organization, a.k.a. Cult.\n\n\u2666Links\u2666 \nWhy Do Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Observe The Lord\u2019s Supper Differently From The Way Other Religions Do?- https://bit.ly/37yQJvl \nMay 1, 2007 Watchtower- https://bit.ly/3q8XKJA \nProclaimers Book- https://bit.ly/3JgGuKa \nPartakers Chart- https://bit.ly/3CLZiyc \nJanuary SE 2016 Watchtower- https://bit.ly/3MSuBMt \nOctober 15, 1983, Watchtower- https://bit.ly/3IeDZXx \nApril 1, 1979, Watchtower- https://bit.ly/3ic9BCy \n\n \u2666Timestamps\u2666\n 00:00 Intro \n00:12 Welcome \n01:46 What is the Memorial? \n03:13 The 144,000 Doctrine \n06:34 The Changing Doctrine \n12:30 What Did Jesus Say? \n14:05 My Thoughts \n\n\n\u2666 RECOMMENDED VIDEOS/PLAYLISTS \u2666\n\u263A VIDEO: https://youtu.be/l1QC7f-KNcQ \n\u263A VIDEO: https://youtu.be/Dd1P1QH4IIA\n\u263A PLAYLIST: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFcWuvwyFdY8OKIuez8rDSHT6fON-sC80\u0026si=ps_kNU4MgObWZjo2\n\n\u263A MY MUSIC SINGLE FROM BEFORE I WAS XJW CURIOUS!\u263A\n:https://amzn.to/3ao3JBE\n\n\u2666 ABOUT ME \u2666\nI was a Jehovah\u0027s Witness from the age of eight.
