She earned her Master of Arts in Organizational Psychology at the Harvard Extension School, where she focused her research on group behavior, social norms, culture, extremism, leadership, demagoguery and cults\u0022 \n(see more on her website referenced above)\n\n\nFollow if you\u2019re not already:\n\nSee her website and  pre-order her new book with called The Culting Of America  with co-author @TheWhiteWomanWhisperer :\n\nhttps://knittingcultlady.com/?srsltid=AfmBOorODKkauFdMx00hI9iom59I0AqS7WI4toSJVVlLHDf1GftXOZzE\n \n\nMy articles, podcasts , etc are here: https://linktr.ee/MelanieHamlett\n\nAnd if you\u2019re feeling generous\u2026\n\nVenmo: https://venmo.com/u/Melanie-Hamlett\n\nPayPal : https://www.paypal.me/hamlettwriting\n\nCashapp: https://cash.app/$melaniehamlett77\n\nTo read any or all of my work, (over 60\u002B articles for Harper\u0027s Bazaar, Cosmo, Oprah Magazine, The Guardian, The Washington Post, Huffington Post, The Daily Beast, Glamour Magazine, Outside Magazine, Slate, Playboy, Shondaland, etc, etc) go here:\n https://www.melaniehamlett.com/publications\n\n\nTo access my mini workshop on how to break into writing for big publications, click here: \nhttps://www.melaniehamlett.com/pitching-workshop\n\n#cult #patriarchy #narcissist #survivor #feminism #decentermen #forwomen #charliekirk #america \n#melaniehamlett #empowerwomen #womeninmedia #patriachyproblems # #intersecionalfeminism",
