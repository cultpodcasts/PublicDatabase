Serge\u0027s parents and his brothers were also part of the Sea Organization. After several years of hard labor, no education, no family support and a rigorous schedule, Serge\u0027s life was in ruins. At age 19, while he was living on L Ron Hubbard Way, Serge had a fireworks accident in which he lost both of his hands and one of his eyes. Thereafter he was promptly cut off from his family and all mental and emotional support, as a result of which Serge was homeless on Hollywood Blvd for 10 years.\n\nThe Aftermath Foundation presents: The Story of Serge Obolensky.\n\n#scientology #aftermathfoundation",
