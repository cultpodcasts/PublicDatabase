      "description": "When Chantelle was sent to the cult Headquarters as an \u201Cencouragement case,\u201D she encountered Bill Gothard\u2019s inappropriate and abusive behavior toward teenage girls firsthand. She shares what it was like to grow up in IBLP and ATI, survive both Headquarters and the cult\u2019s finishing school for young ladies, and ultimately marry young to escape her father\u2019s \u201Cumbrella of authority.\u201D Today, Chantelle uses her story and training in hypnotherapy to educate others and bring healing to those manipulated by shame, guilt, and fear. She also offers practical ideas and resources for people who want to pursue healing but face financial constraints.

For Amanda, this conversation runs even deeper. As someone who\u2019s lost both a biological and chosen family, the process of preparing to become a parent brings up a lot of questions\u2014about worthiness, healing, and whether having a family is in the cards for her.

      "description": "In this episode, we sit down with Nate, an IBLP/ATI cult survivor and trauma survivor, to unpack the deeply ingrained conditioning we experienced growing up in the cult. From childhood grooming and the loss of personal identity to the twisted teachings that framed God\u2019s love as something to be earned, we explore the ways the cult set us up for harm. Nate shares his personal journey of launching into adulthood without the tools to navigate the real world, the challenges of healing from childhood and religious trauma, and his experiences as a man seeking therapy. We also discuss what it means to reclaim agency, identity, and self-worth after years of being treated as a prop in someone else\u0027s narrative. Was it \u201Cworth it all\u201D as IBLP promised?

Skye\u0027s story caught our attention right away\u2014her mother, the owner of an adult toy business, sent her to a fundamentalist Christian elementary school WAIT WHAT?! The part about her mom\u2019s business is a great story and will make you chuckle, but unfortunately, this school is also where Skye first experienced grooming. It was also at this school, at just seven years old, she was told Satan was living in her heart, sparking a deconstruction journey that began decades before, well, many of us. In this episode, Skye delivers a powerful message on the importance of listening to children when they express discomfort, how naivety can make individuals more vulnerable to grooming, and the crucial role of believing and protecting survivors from further harm. She also opens up about her own journey to heal and reclaim her ability to trust and find goodness in others, even those with differing beliefs. Topic warning: Grooming, rape, biphobia Send us text!

A best practice is probably not to repeat any new phrases until you Google them, but sadly that is not what happened. Amanda also tells Kyle about some of her greatest successes in the military and how growing up in a cult helped her cope with military training and other high-pressure environments. Kyle asks Amanda the greatest hinderance she faced as a female cult kid who went into a STEM career field in the military, and it just so happens that you really do need to know more math than fractions. But also, according to the cult, females are not supposed to be in the military. This episode (or at least the good parts of this episode) is dedicated to the men and women with whom Amanda served, will forever love, and for whom she will always be grateful. Correction: Amanda mentions \u0022431 paperwork\u0022 in the episode. What she referred to is actually called AETC Form 341 .",

Maureen teaches us how MLMs seem to adopt spiritual language, which appeals to individuals in cults, and Amanda shares how certain leaders in the IBLP cult used their position to influence members to join an MLM. So...are MLMs cult-ish? Are they preying on women who have limited work options? Listen and let us know!",
