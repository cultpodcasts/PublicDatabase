He belittled and castigated any leaders who stood out.  \n[00:00:14] Over the years, many of the best and talented people left the group on seeing his corruption and abuses. \n[00:00:19] All he left behind when he died, was a legacy of infighting. \n[00:00:22] Witness the battle for control of the 3HO businesses, Yogi Tea and Golden Temple Foods. \n[00:00:27] And now there is a battle for control of the Siri Singh \n[00:00:30] Sahib Corporation, the organization that controls the 3HO Kundalini Yoga cult. \n[00:00:34] The fight is between those who believe the women that have come forward to tell their stories of sexual abuse by Yogi Bhajan, the so called \u0027moderates\u0027  \n[00:00:41] and those that deny any wrong doing by the cult leader, the \u0027deniers\u0027. \n[00:00:44] Rumours of cheating and vote stacking by the deniers have surrounded the upcoming board election. \n[00:00:49] The law firm running the contest has balked at certifying the election of the board until the group can clean up the criteria for voting.  \n[00:00:55] Dishonest, \u0027denier\u0027 teachers in foreign countries were willing to risk the freedom and [00:01:00] possibly even the very lives of their students to further their corrupt goals. \n[00:01:03] At stake in this election is the direction of the group, their willingness to settle fairly with the women who were sexually abused and the children damaged by the abusive 3HO schools in India. \n[00:01:12] The choices made in this election will determine the direction of the 3HO cult for years to come.\n\n#YogiBhajan  #3HO #WhiteTantricYoga   #KundaliniYoga #Kundalini  #itISaCULT  #yogateachers #yoga #meditate #chanting #cult #cultawareness #rapist #childabuse #2ndGEN #miripiriacademy #3HOSchoolsInIndia #3HOReparations  #believewomen #metoo #premkamemoir #premkawhitebirdinagoldencage #3HOCultInfo #3HOCultDocumentary #TrueBelieversTheDarkEmpireOfYogiBhajan #rishiknots #GuruJagat",

The \u201CSiri Singh Sahib Corporation\u201D or SSSC for short, is the title of the 3HO Kundalini Yoga group\u2019s governing body. The name of the corporation comes from the cult leader Yogi Bhajan. The now deceased guru chose the grandiose title \u201Cthe Siri Singh Sahib\u201D for himself while claiming to be head of religious authority \nin the Western Hemisphere for the Sikh religion. \n\nThis audacious claim was disputed by many Indian Sikhs at the time.The main governing body of the Golden Temple, Sikhism\u2019s biggest shrine, also protested. Despite this, somehow his chosen title stood. \n\nWhen cult leader Bhajan died in 2004 the committee designated to run his sprawling empire was named the Siri Singh Sahib Corporation.\n\nIn the past two years, a convincing body of evidence has been building that Yogi Bhajan was a conman, a violent serial sexual abuser of his followers and a fake yogi. He destroyed families, taking children from their parents and sending them to abusive schools in India.\n\nAn unattributed source tells us that the group will be changing their name to the \u201CSerial Sexual Sadist Corp\u201D, or the SSSC for short. This allows them to demonstrate the seriousness of their resolve to show real change in the group\u2019s direction and at the same time save money on printing new stationary.",

      "description": "For more information go to: \nhttps://3hocultinfo.wordpress.com/\n\nOne of Yogi Bhajan\u2019s original \u0027secretaries\u0027 published a tell-all book and it brought forth a tumult of accusations from other women who were sexually abused by the group leader. The whole 3HO house of cards is crumbling and the, now deceased, leader has been revealed as having been a sexual serial predator, a conman and crook. \nYogi Bhajan himself has been dead since 2004, but the truth about him is finally coming out. In early 2020, his first secretary, a woman he gave the spiritual name Premka, released a tell-all book, 30 years after she left the group. It wasn\u2019t her first effort to reveal the truth about the yogi. She had sued him back in the late 80\u2019s but lacked the resources to fight his legal delays. She ended up settling out of court. Because there was no Internet at the time, many in the 3 H O community didn\u2019t hear about it, or if they did, were told to deny the story and quickly forgot what had actually happened.\nIn early 2020, the book, \u0022Premka-White Bird in a Golden Cage\u0022 by Pamela Saharah Dyson, found an audience. Because of social media the news about the yogi\u0027s sexual predation could not be contained by 3 H O. The reaction to the book grew particularly strong in a Facebook group called \u201CBeyond the Cage\u201D. The Facebook group drew people out and the stories started to flow. So much so that the people in 3 H O couldn\u2019t ignore the stories any more.\nFor more information, check out these articles: \n* LA Magazine - Yogi Bhajan Turned an L.A.

Because of social media the news about the yogi\u0027s sexual predation could not be contained by 3 H O.

      "description": "For more information go to: \n\nhttps://3hocultinfo.wordpress.com/\n\n\nOne of Yogi Bhajan\u2019s original \u0027secretaries\u0027 published a tell-all book and it brought forth a tumult of accusations from other women who were sexually abused by the group leader. The whole 3HO house of cards is crumbling and the, now deceased, leader has been revealed as having been a sexual serial predator, a conman and crook. \nYogi Bhajan himself has been dead since 2004, but the truth about him is finally coming out. In early 2020, his first secretary, a woman he gave the spiritual name Premka, released a tell-all book, 30 years after she left the group. It wasn\u2019t her first effort to reveal the truth about the yogi. She had sued him back in the late 80\u2019s but lacked the resources to fight his legal delays. She ended up settling out of court. Because there was no Internet at the time, many in the 3 H O community didn\u2019t hear about it, or if they did, were told to deny the story and quickly forgot what had actually happened.\nIn early 2020, the book, \u0022Premka-White Bird in a Golden Cage\u0022 by Pamela Saharah Dyson, found an audience. Because of social media the news about the yogi\u0027s sexual predation could not be contained by 3 H O. The reaction to the book grew particularly strong in a Facebook group called \u201CBeyond the Cage\u201D. The Facebook group drew people out and the stories started to flow. So much so that the people in 3 H O couldn\u2019t ignore the stories any more.\nFor more information, check out these articles: \n* LA Magazine - Yogi Bhajan Turned an L.A.
