      "description": "This week, we talked to Jon Raymond (author of Denial, Freebird; screenwriter of Old Joy, First Cow \u0026 Showing Up w/ Kelly Reichardt, Mildred Pierce w/ Todd Haynes) about The Source Family documentary, which follows the rock n\u2019 roll hippie California cult of the same name. We also talk about Jon\u2019s work with Kelly Reichardt, why so many cult leaders also want to be rock n\u2019 roll stars, the legacy and legitimacy of Yahowa 13\u2019s music recordings \u0026 how The Source Family might have been The Monkees of the California cult scene. So get your stars aligned and your multidimensional soup ready for this week\u2019s episode of Revolutions Per Movie.
