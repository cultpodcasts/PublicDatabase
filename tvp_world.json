      "description": "TVP World\u0027s Europe Editor Marcin Zaborowski says the newly released files show Jeffrey Epstein wasn\u2019t just running a sex-trafficking operation; he may have been tangled with Russian and Belarusian power networks. Zaborowski highlights Epstein\u2019s Russia trips, alleged ties to Vladimir Putin, and use of honey traps to collect kompromat. \n\nEpstein also bankrolled Karina Shulyak, his Belarusian model-dentist girlfriend, and helped her enter Columbia, raising questions about his network. Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s intelligence-linked family may have passed on to him an existing espionage operation. Zaborowski also explains the political fallout, from pressure on Donald Trump to potential Hillary Clinton testimony, and why Poland now seeks a national security investigation.\n\nHost: Maciej Mikos\n\n\uD83D\uDD34 Watch our 24/7 livestream - https://youtube.com/live/m4mVcUReR6Y\n\nBringing you all the latest daily news and updates, TVP World is Poland\u0027s first English-language channel where you can find world news as seen from the Polish perspective and the latest news from the CEE region.

      "description": "Matthew Day says the new Jeffrey Epstein files show Central and Eastern Europe \u2013 especially Poland  \u2013 served as a recruiting ground, with Warsaw as the operation\u0027s travel hub for moving young women abroad.\n\nHe explains that Epstein\u2019s team didn\u2019t only use agencies to find women; they also drove through villages looking for girls, often targeting poor or broken homes with promises of money, apartments, or education.\n\nAccording to witness testimony, this allegedly happened at a shocking scale, sometimes around five underage girls a week in the early 2000s. Day also warns that beyond trafficking, there may be a blackmail angle involving powerful people, which is why governments like Poland are treating this as a national security issue.\n\nHis bottom line: there are millions of documents still unseen, key names are redacted, and until everything comes out, real accountability is likely to remain nonexistent.\n\n#epstein #poland #trafficking #warsaw #recruitment #scandal\n\n\uD83D\uDD34 Watch our 24/7 livestream - https://youtube.com/live/m4mVcUReR6Y\n\nBringing you all the latest daily news and updates, TVP World is Poland\u0027s first English-language channel where you can find world news as seen from the Polish perspective and the latest news from the CEE region.
