      "description": "Matthew Day says the new Jeffrey Epstein files show Central and Eastern Europe \u2013 especially Poland  \u2013 served as a recruiting ground, with Warsaw as the operation\u0027s travel hub for moving young women abroad.\n\nHe explains that Epstein\u2019s team didn\u2019t only use agencies to find women; they also drove through villages looking for girls, often targeting poor or broken homes with promises of money, apartments, or education.\n\nAccording to witness testimony, this allegedly happened at a shocking scale, sometimes around five underage girls a week in the early 2000s. Day also warns that beyond trafficking, there may be a blackmail angle involving powerful people, which is why governments like Poland are treating this as a national security issue.\n\nHis bottom line: there are millions of documents still unseen, key names are redacted, and until everything comes out, real accountability is likely to remain nonexistent.\n\n#epstein #poland #trafficking #warsaw #recruitment #scandal\n\n\uD83D\uDD34 Watch our 24/7 livestream - https://youtube.com/live/m4mVcUReR6Y\n\nBringing you all the latest daily news and updates, TVP World is Poland\u0027s first English-language channel where you can find world news as seen from the Polish perspective and the latest news from the CEE region.
