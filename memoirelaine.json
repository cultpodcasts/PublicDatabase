      "description": "Hi! My name is Elaine Quiambao, Mental health advocate/counselor.\nI have a background in Mental health recovery and Trauma Informed Care and hold a B.A in Child Development and a Master\u0027s degree in Education with a concentration in Counseling from San Diego State University. I am also in the process of obtaining Religious Trauma certification.\n\nIn this video I discuss the impact of leaving an Authoritarian or Fundamentalist religion and the transition of leaving. I acknowledge how painful it can be when transitioning out of a religion or faith you were raised in. I also acknowledge how painful it can be for families experiencing this. This video is not meant to criticize or point blame or create shame, it is meant to educate and create space for healing and awareness regarding a very sensitive topic that many communities experience, especially collectivist or tight-knit communities. I hope it can bring you a sense of peace and if you can relate or if it resonates with you, feel free to leave a comment. I wish you the best on your healing journey.\n\n\u0022What may be a source of strength for you can be a thorn for someone else\u0022- Elaine, M.A.\n\nWith love \u0026 support,\nElaine (instagram.com/memoir_elaine)\n\nNational Domestic Violence hotline:\nhttps://www.thehotline.org\n\n*Free online Resources for healing during your transition:\nwww.traumastery.com/religious-trauma-quiz\nhttps://www.tothinkagain.co.uk\n/identifying-a-cult\nhttps://www.tothinkagain.co.uk\n/communicating-with-a-cult-member\nwww.spiritualsoundingboard.com/2020/05/25/religious-power-and-control-minimizing-denying-and-blaming/\nhttps://www.religioustraumainstitute.com\nwww.therapinay.com\nwww.choosingtherapy.com/religious-trauma-syndrome/\nwww.betterhelp.com\nhttps://up2sd.org/\nwww.webmd.com\n/balance/features/how-to-be-more-empathetic\n\n*Religious trauma certification for counselors/therapists/healers:\nhttps://www.traumastery.com\n\n*Psychoeducation/Books: \nAdult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents: How to Heal from Distant, Rejecting, or Self-Involved Parents by Lindsay C.
