Why are we so interested in the stories of Jonestown, Charles Manson, and Patty Hearst? Today Danielle explores how these groups entered the public consciousness and why we find it so hard to look away.\n\nRevolutionary 60s: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQXo2VjLtDM\u0026list=PLLfvwXL7G2IiMiTL1rEzj8bLJbFGBbb7A\n\nWritten and Hosted by: Danielle Bainbridge\nProduced by Complexly for PBS Digital Studios \n#Cults #CharlesManson #Jonestown\n---\nFollow us on...\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/originofeverythingpbs/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/pbsoriginofeverything/?hl=en \n---\nOrigin of Everything is a show about the undertold histories and cultural dialogues that make up our collective story. From the food we eat, to the trivia and fun facts we can\u2019t seem to get out of our heads, to the social issues we can\u2019t stop debating, everything around us has a history. Origin of Everything is here to explore it all. We like to think that no topic is too small or too challenging to get started.\n\nWorks Cited:\nProfessor Janja Lalich\nhttp://cultresearch.org/category/cults-the-basics/\nOther works by Dr. Lalich include being coauthor with clinical psychologist Dr. Margaret Thaler Singer of two books: \u201CCrazy\u201D Therapies: What Are They?
