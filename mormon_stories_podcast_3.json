Any member of the LDS Church today who enters the practice of polygamy is immediately excommunicated. However, Pearson claims, polygamy itself has never been excommunicated, but has an honored and protected place at the table.

No such opportunity is available to women. Through her own personal stories, those of her ancestors, and the thousands of stories that came to her through an Internet survey, Pearson shows the power of the Ghost of Eternal Polygamy as it not only waits on the other side to greet the most righteous in heaven, but also haunts the living\u2014hiding in the recesses of the Mormon psyche, inflicting profound pain and fear, assuring women that they are still objects, harming or destroying marriages, bringing chaos to family relationships, leading many to lose faith in the church and in God.\u0022",

Jaxon was introduced to issues of Mormon faith as his mother lost belief in and left the LDS church, while his father remained faithful to the church. Jaxon\u2019s involvement in an interfaith family led to strong personal interest in matters of faith, which has led to extensive interfaith efforts. In this interview Jaxon discusses his own history of doubts, including his experiencing watching the church evolve as an active Mormon youth in how it speaks about and teaches certain issues. He explains how he reconciles difficult Mormon issues and also discusses his view of classic and modern Mormon apologetics, including the newly coined term/wave of \u201Cneo-apologetics.\u201D",

      "description": "In this Mormon Stories Podcast episode, we interview millennial apologist Jaxon Washburn. Jaxon is 19 year old, pre-mission Mormon apologist attending Arizona State University.  Jaxon was introduced to issues of Mormon faith as his mother lost belief in and left the LDS church, while his father remained faithful to the church. Jaxon\u2019s involvement in an interfaith family led to strong personal interest in matters of faith, which has led to extensive interfaith efforts. In this interview Jaxon discusses his own history of doubts, including his experiencing watching the church evolve as an active Mormon youth in how it speaks about and teaches certain issues. He explains how he reconciles difficult Mormon issues and also discusses his view of classic and modern Mormon apologetics, including the newly coined term/wave of \u201Cneo-apologetics.\u201D",

      "description": "Beginning our series on Mormon leaders and inappropriate interviews regarding sexuality, we provide 6 mini-interviews with Mormon Stories listeners who share their experiences discussing sexual matters with LDS leaders. \u00A0A new petition created by past guest Sam Young seeks to provoke conversation and change around this subject. From the petition: \u201CFor decades, it has been common practice for Bishops, Bishopric Counselors, Stake Presidents, and Stake President Counselors to pose questions of a sexual nature to children. There are reports of this happening to children as young as age 8. These questions are being asked by an older man, all alone with the child, behind closed doors and often without the knowledge or permission of the parents. Almost universally, these men have no comprehensive training. Here is a list of potential harm. All the risks below are actual consequences that have been experienced from sexual interviews with LDS children. 1. Suicide. 2. Attempted suicide. 3. Suicidal ideation. 4. Inappropriate shame and guilt. 5. Childhood filled with self loathing. 6. Adulthood filled with self loathing. 7. Normalizing children to sexual questions by adult men. (Grooming) 8. Sexual abuse. (Pedophilia) 9. Impaired sexual relations after marriage. 10. Years of recovery from childhood shaming. Often lasting decades.\u201D Sam Young\u2018s petition can be found here if you want to sign:  http://protectldschildren.org _______________________________________ Part 1:\u00A0Interview with Paul and Ann Part 2: Interview with\u00A0Anna, Tyler, and Lara Part 3:\u00A0Maile, Ryan, and Ryan",

      "description": "Beginning our series on Mormon leaders and inappropriate interviews regarding sexuality, we provide 6 mini-interviews with Mormon Stories listeners who share their experiences discussing sexual matters with LDS leaders. \u00A0A new petition created by past guest Sam Young seeks to provoke conversation and change around this subject. From the petition: \u201CFor decades, it has been common practice for Bishops, Bishopric Counselors, Stake Presidents, and Stake President Counselors to pose questions of a sexual nature to children. There are reports of this happening to children as young as age 8. These questions are being asked by an older man, all alone with the child, behind closed doors and often without the knowledge or permission of the parents. Almost universally, these men have no comprehensive training. Here is a list of potential harm. All the risks below are actual consequences that have been experienced from sexual interviews with LDS children. 1. Suicide. 2. Attempted suicide. 3. Suicidal ideation. 4. Inappropriate shame and guilt. 5. Childhood filled with self loathing. 6. Adulthood filled with self loathing. 7. Normalizing children to sexual questions by adult men. (Grooming) 8. Sexual abuse. (Pedophilia) 9. Impaired sexual relations after marriage. 10. Years of recovery from childhood shaming.

In this interview we cover: *How Sarah struggled as a youth knowing that she came from the \u2018Lamanites,\u2019 who had turned their backs on God. *How she worked her way through college in Rexburg, ID, acquired a degree in Communications/Journalism, and how her new knowledge around sourcing served as an impetus to her questioning her faith. *How her husband ignored the Mormon admonition against interracial marriage, out of love for Sarah. *Her avoidance of dancing (and other native customs), as they were practiced by the \u2019Lamanites\u2019 in the Book of Mormon. *Her avoidance of the sun, as a way to ensure that her skin would stay as light as possible. *How she used her knowledge of sourcing (seeking original documentation) to discover many of the problems with LDS church history and doctrine, all before discovering the CES Letter. *How Mormon Stories Podcast validated her feelings, and provided strength and a sense of community during her faith transition. *How she now embraces her life in the sun, and is on a journey to connect to the heritage and identity she felt forced to distance herself from while a member of the LDS Church. We thank Sarah for sharing her powerful, beautiful story and know that it will touch lives!",

In part\u00A02, Derrick shares his beliefs and reasons for remaining active in the LDS Church and the important role personal honesty and integrity play in that decision. As a general rule, Derrick avoids dogma and does not rely heavily on truth claims as the root of his faith. Derrick and John answer the difficult questions such as:  \u201CIs it disingenuous to stay active in the LDS Church with knowledge of \u2018problems\u2019 of historicity and knowing the harm the church inflicts on groups of people, like LGBTQ individuals?\u201D \u201CAre the people who remain complicit in that harm?\u201D \u201CShould the teachings of the church be taken literally or metaphorically?\u201D",

      "description": "As part of our series on meetings with Mormon General Authorities, we interview Meg and Jake Abhau as they relay the story of their September 2013 meeting with Mormon Apostle Elder D. Todd Christofferson. \u00A0 \u00A0 Meg and Jake appeared on  episodes 508-510 of Mormon Stories discussing their experiences in early 2013 when their 13 year old son, Jon, came out to them as gay while they were living as committed, orthodox Mormons. \u00A0During this period Meg and Jake met Tom Christofferson, brother of Mormon Apostle D. Todd Christofferson. \u00A0At the time Meg and Jake met Tom he was an excommunicated gay Mormon man living in a committed relationship for over 18 years. \u00A0After hearing the Abhau\u2019s story, Tom graciously offered to arrange a meeting between them and his brother, Elder D. Todd Christofferson. \u00A0 In this episode Meg and Jake recount in detail their 1\u002B hour with apostle D. Todd Christofferson, which included: \u00A0  Elder D. Todd Christofferson acknowledging that the LDS Church may not be a safe place for our LGBT youth, Elder Christofferson acknowledging to Meg and Jake that personal revelation trumps revelation from Mormon leadership \u00A0(but that he would never be able to admit this publicly to church members), and Meg informing Elder Christofferson that he and other LDS leadership had/have \u201Cblood on their hands\u201D for the way that they have mishandled LGBT issues, contributing to a modern wave of LGBT youth suicides.   Meg and Jake also express their disappointment with Elder Christofferson\u2019s role in speaking as the representative for the LDS church during the November 2015 policy decision denouncing same-sex couples as apostates, and disallowing their children from being baptised into the Mormon church. \u00A0They also discuss their respective decisions to leave the Mormon church after decades of orthodox membership.",

      "description": "We are a group of women 40\u002B with longer life experiences. We are grandmothers, mothers, aunts, single, divorced, widowed or married. We are LGBT friendly and feminists! Many of us are just learning feminism. Having felt the pain of patriarchy, but not having a \u201Clanguage\u201D to describe our experiences, we are giving ourselves permission to flourish and grow with no limitations or constructs. Many of us are at the beginning of a life we never imagined. We have had to make tough decisions, been tried by our choices, and some of us have lost important connections along the way. Being of a \u201Ccertain age\u201D makes it harder to make friends and to find a community of like-minded souls with whom to move forward with love, joy and friendship. We realize that our decisions can affect many generations, so our time is spent fostering relationships with our loved ones and excelling in our careers, businesses, and at home, all of which leaves little time and opportunity to make new friends. This group is for \u201Cwomen of a certain age\u201D or lovingly called WOCA (Wah-kah). We also have a group for \u201Cwomen of a certain age\u201D and under. This age group, affectionally known as the UNDERS is from 30-40. The final group under the umbrella of WOCA are the COCAs. These are \u201CCouples of a Certain Age\u201D for those wishing to participate as couples. And housed inside of COCA is the \u201Cmen only\u201D group which meet regularly in men-only events. WOCA activities are NOT within the paradigm of our former religious background, although themes from our lived experiences may come up. We have transitioned from our former organized religious choices and wish to create wonderful spaces where ALL people with commonalities can come together, share and find community.

      "description": "Marco Meiling, active and believing LDS church member in the Netherlands, reports on the beginning of a major contraction of the LDS Church in Europe. From Marco\u0027s original message to me:  Have you heard yet about a big push to consolidate the units in Europe. We are having closing after closing being announced.\u00A0Yesterday a closing was announced, and the Stake President stated there are 800 units in Europe which are considered too weak and would need to merge. \u00A0We have 1163 units in Western Europe acc to\u00A0Cumorah.com. Holland with 34 wards will close 5 at least this year. \u00A0In Holland the Church is phasing out all wards which don\u00B4t have a purpose-built Chapel. Temple-attendance here is down 60% compared to 2000. \u00A0However the amount of recommendholders went up 200%. So what do we make of this: A Temple is a way for the Church to increase revenue. So even with less people, the Church can make a higher turnover.\u00A0 The main reason given is that these units are too weak to run programmes aimed at the youth. and small units demand too much from the few members. \u00A0Research has shown that people and families benefit form larger wards, and families are less burdened. That why the policy direction. Of course the longer travel will cause problems for some menbers. Assistance will be needed.",

      "description": "In this episode, an all-star panel reviews a recently leaked presentation created by the quorum of the twelve apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The presentation is entitled \u0022Area Business Weekends,\u0022 is dated December 8, 2015, and lays out\u00A0the process for local LDS stakes and areas to request special training meetings from the LDS quorum of the 12 (e.g., Boise Rescue, Elder Ballard\u0027s Young Single Adult stake in Utah County). Within the presentation the LDS Q12 reveals\u00A0its view on the external causes for\u00A0people leaving the LDS church, which explicitly\u00A0name individuals such as John Dehlin, Denver Snuffer, and Robert Norman, along with other broader trends, movements, and ideas such as secularism, Ordain Women, support for same-sex marriage (entitled \u0022Disagree with current policies\u0022), chastity, pornography, lack of commitment, failure to observe the sabbath, those fascinated with the \u0022last days/end of world\u0022 (i.e., Preppers/Julie Rowe), \u0022false prophets,\u0022 and anyone who feels they need \u0022something more\u0022 from the church. In no instance\u00A0does the Quorum of the 12 demonstrate introspection as to what they or the church might be doing to contribute to disaffection from the Mormon church. Today\u0027s panel includes Dr. Gina Colvin (A Thoughtful Faith Podcast\u00A0and\u00A0KiwiMormon), Lindsay Hansen Park (Sunstone), Pastor John Hamer (Toronto Community of Christ),\u00A0Jesse Stay, and Ryan McKnight (Mormon Leaks).",

      "description": "A bit of sad news, and a bit of happy news. \u00A0First the sad. Grant Palmer, author of\u00A0An Insider\u2019s View of Mormon Origins\u00A0\u2013 certainly one of the most important books in 20th/21st century Mormonism, is dying of cancer. \u00A0I confirmed this with Grant yesterday \u2013 when he related to me that he likely only has weeks/months to live. \u00A0This information moves many of us deeply, since Grant\u2019s courageous scholarship\u00A0over the years (which has come at a great personal cost to him) has been instrumental in helping tens of thousands of Mormons understand their church history more accurately. \u00A0I dare say that projects\u00A0like Mormon Stories Podcast,\u00A0Mormon Think,\u00A0Letter to a CES Director, and even the recent\u00A0LDS Church Gospel Topics Essays\u00A0would not exist without the courage and scholarship\u00A0of Grant Palmer. Now for the happy news. \u00A0Mormon Stories Podcast and the Open Stories Foundation, along with a few supporters,\u00A0will be holding a private event in Grant Palmer\u2019s honor on the evening of February 15, 2017* in Utah\u00A0\u2013 with the plan of live-streaming the event to all who are interested in showing support for Grant. \u00A0The event will include:  An interview with Grant, wherein he will discuss his most recent book, along with reflections on his life. A chance for some of those who are grateful for Grant\u2019s work to express appreciation for him.  If you are interested in participating in this tribute/celebration, there are a few things you can do to participate:  Record a brief Facebook or Youtube video expressing your gratitude to Grant (and his positive impact on your life), and post the link as a comment here. Write a text-based tribute to Grant in the comments section here. Send an email to\u00A0mormonstories@gmail.com\u00A0with \u201CGrant Pamer\u201D in the subject line, wherein you express to Grant your gratitude for the positive impact that his work has had on your life.  Feel free to use the hash tag #grantpalmer for any of the tributes you share on social media. \u00A0Finally, these emails, blog comments, and videos will be gathered and shared with Grant at the live-steamed, worldwide event in honor of him. Thanks for taking the time to honor Grant with us, and we very much look forward to the evening of February 15th* wherein we hope to\u00A0show Grant how much we love and appreciate him! \u00A0*Date subject to how Grant is doing/feeling.",

      "description": "As the first interview for the new\u00A0Mormon Transitions project, I am\u00A0incredibly\u00A0pleased to interview my dear wife of 23 years, Margaret (Margi) Weber Dehlin. \u00A0In this three-part interview, I ask Margi a series of 46 questions focusing on thee parts:  Part 1: Margi\u0027s life as a believing Mormon. \u00A0This includes questions about how her family joined the LDS church in Washington D.C. during the 1970s, reflections on her own \u0022conversion\u0022 to the church,\u00A0Margi\u0027s\u00A0favorite parts about being a believing, active Mormon, and the most challenging parts as well. Part 2: Margi\u0027s faith crisis and transition away from Mormon orthodoxy, including our time trying to remain LDS as semi-believers, and her experiences and reflections on my excommunication. \u00A0Topics include the impetus for Margi\u0027s faith transition, how she/we \u0022came out\u0022 to our children parents, extended family, etc.\u00A0as unorthodox Mormons, and what the most difficult and rewarding parts of the transition were. Part 3: Margi\u0027s life and perspective now, as a post-Mormon, including reflections on her current beliefs and non-beliefs, her approach to nurturing a healthy/happy family without religion, how she approaches raising children without the church, and why she feels as though she and our family are happier and healthier than ever before after leaving the church.  The plan for Mormon Transitions podcast is\u00A0as follows:  We plan to conduct somewhere between 20 and 30 of these interviews, and to share them at http://mormontransitions.org. \u00A0We also plan to \u0022chop\u0022 these interviews up by question, so that people can peruse the interview by topic (e.g., raising children after a faith crisis, how to \u0022come out\u0022 to family and friends, secular spirituality, dealing with death). We plan to host a weekly call-in show where people can call with their questions/concerns and receive feedback from a mental health professional and/or expert. We plan to compile all the advice and perspective over 2017 into a book entitled something to the effect of, \u0022Navigating a Mormon Transition.\u0022 We plan to continue hosting Mormon Transition Events across the U.S. \u00A0See our\u00A0Mormon Transitions event calendar\u00A0for events as they are scheduled.  If you support Mormon Stories,\u00A0Mormon Transitions,\u00A0Mormon Matters,\u00A0A Thoughtful Faith, or any of the\u00A0Open Stories Foundation\u00A0projects, please consider a donation today. \u00A0You can donate via any of the \u0022donate\u0022 buttons on any of the pages.",

      "description": "As the first interview for the new\u00A0Mormon Transitions project, I am\u00A0incredibly\u00A0pleased to interview my dear wife of 23 years, Margaret (Margi) Weber Dehlin. \u00A0In this three-part interview, I ask Margi a series of 46 questions focusing on thee parts:  Part 1: Margi\u0027s life as a believing Mormon. \u00A0This includes questions about how her family joined the LDS church in Washington D.C. during the 1970s, reflections on her own \u0022conversion\u0022 to the church,\u00A0Margi\u0027s\u00A0favorite parts about being a believing, active Mormon, and the most challenging parts as well. Part 2: Margi\u0027s faith crisis and transition away from Mormon orthodoxy, including our time trying to remain LDS as semi-believers, and her experiences and reflections on my excommunication. \u00A0Topics include the impetus for Margi\u0027s faith transition, how she/we \u0022came out\u0022 to our children parents, extended family, etc.\u00A0as unorthodox Mormons, and what the most difficult and rewarding parts of the transition were. Part 3: Margi\u0027s life and perspective now, as a post-Mormon, including reflections on her current beliefs and non-beliefs, her approach to nurturing a healthy/happy family without religion, how she approaches raising children without the church, and why she feels as though she and our family are happier and healthier than ever before after leaving the church.  The plan for Mormon Transitions podcast is\u00A0as follows:  We plan to conduct somewhere between 20 and 30 of these interviews, and to share them at http://mormontransitions.org. \u00A0We also plan to \u0022chop\u0022 these interviews up by question, so that people can peruse the interview by topic (e.g., raising children after a faith crisis, how to \u0022come out\u0022 to family and friends, secular spirituality, dealing with death). We plan to host a weekly call-in show where people can call with their questions/concerns and receive feedback from a mental health professional and/or expert. We plan to compile all the advice and perspective over 2017 into a book entitled something to the effect of, \u0022Navigating a Mormon Transition.\u0022 We plan to continue hosting Mormon Transition Events across the U.S. \u00A0See our\u00A0Mormon Transitions event calendar\u00A0for events as they are scheduled.

      "description": "On a recent trip from New Jersey to Vermont with Mormon Therapist Natasha Helfer Parker and Dr. Gina Colvin we decided to have a rough, unplanned, unrehearsed, and VERY\u00A0informal first discussion about post-Mormon polyamory and non-monogamy. \u00A0 For those who care deeply about this issue, there are a few very important things we would like to emphasize:  This is a rough, free-form, first discussion about orthodox, transitioning, and post-Mormon non-monogamy and polyamory. \u00A0This is not meant to be a pre-planned, comprehensive, uber-professional treatment of the topic. \u00A0If you are looking for such a treatment, please do not listen. For those of you who are very knowledgable about and/or experienced with polyamory and non-monogamy,\u00A0we openly acknowledge that we likely (or most definitely)\u00A0employed\u00A0several incorrect or improper terms, stereotypes, and biases in this discussion. We do this partially on purpose - because it gives us/you a chance to explore and correct common mistakes or misperceptions used regarding these sensitive and important topics. \u00A0 For those of you who are interested in this topic, or who were frustrated in any way by this first treatment/discussion -\u00A0we hope that you will give us your thoughts, perspective, and respectful criticisms in the blog comments. \u00A0Then, please know what we 100% plan to have at least a few future guests on Mormon Stories Podcast to explore this topic more in-depth, and in more serious ways. \u00A0If you have participated in polyamory and/or non-monogamy as an active, transitioning, or post-Mormon, we invite you to contact us about appearing in a future episode. \u00A0mormonstories@gmail.com  Thanks for your patience, understanding, support, participation, and good\u00A0will as we begin to explore this important topic that affects many people in orthodox, transitioning, and post-Mormonism.",

They have served in high-level callings in their Anchorage ward, and are very well-respected and well-liked in their Alaska LDS community. Two years ago Amy and Jake began to have doubts about the truthfulness of the LDS Church. As they began to share their questions/doubts/concerns about LDS doctrine and policy on Facebook (e.g., the November 2015 policy against LGBT Mormons and their children), their posts were monitored by ward and stake members and reported to the stake leadership. When they were directly asked by their stake president to remain silent about their questions/concerns/doubts/disbelief \u2013 they declined as a matter of conscience. Recently when they spoke out publicly on Facebook against the November, 2015 LGBT policy (out of concern for LDS LGBT youth suicides) they were informed by their LDS stake president that they will soon be excommunicated. The date/time of their disciplinary council is October 11, 2016 at 9pm Utah time. This is their story.

      "description": "Dr. Omar Kader was born in Provo, Utah to Palestinian immigrants. HIs father was a devout Muslim and a disabled World War I vet who owned a successful Provo fruit farm. During Omar\u0027s childhood he and his family were called the n-word by fellow Provoans, but fought to earn the respect of his community. Omar and his father were close friends of Dr. Hugh Nibley, who liked to practice his Arabic skills with Omar\u0027s dad. In this epic multi-part series, we hear several inspiring stories, including:  How Omar escaped Palestine after being sent back there by his father to prevent him from marrying a Utah woman. How Dr. Hugh Nibley fought to help Omar enroll in Brigham Young University. How Omar met, courted, and married his amazing wife Nancy - a brilliant Mormon girl from Ogden, UT (this courtship included his conversion to the LDS faith). We also touch on what it was like to enter into a multi-cultural marriage in Utah during the 1960s. Omar\u0027s draft into the Vietnam War (serving in Germany) How Omar and Nancy risked expulsion from BYU for fighting against the Vietnam war and for supporting the BYU Student Democratic Party during the Earnest L.

After stumbling on the LDS Gospel Topics Essays and learning about Joseph Smith\u0027s polyandry, the Book of Abraham translation problems, etc. -- and specifically after the LDS Church November 2015 policy change regarding LGBT members and their children -- Sam experienced an LDS faith crisis. Over time, Sam developed his own method for expressing concern about LDS policy and administrative problems -- he decided to begin living the Law of Common Consent as found in Doctrine and Covenants 26, which to him means that during every ward, stake and general conference Sam will be voting opposed when asked to sustain the LDS first presidency and the quorum of the 12 apostles. Sam is also inviting other LDS church members to consider a similar approach if they object to recent policy and administrative changes. This interview includes Jamie Hanis Handy and Sam\u0027s 85 year old mother, Bertie, who recently resigned her church membership over similar concerns to Sam.",

After consulting with his LDS bishop, he was told that his \u201Csame-sex attraction\u201D would \u201Cresolve itself\u201D once he served an LDS mission. His LDS patriarchal blessing also assured him that he would serve a complete LDS mission. After being called to the Leeds, England mission, Mike was physically and emotionally abused by his first companion. Suffering with severe PTSD symptoms, he tried for two months to remain in the mission, but did not receive appropriate mental health care. Instead, his mission-assigned therapist focused primarily on encouraging Mike to read his scriptures and pray more, which only reinforced his feelings of shame/blame as an abuse victim. In addition, Mike\u2019s abusive companion was never punished for the abuse (to his knowledge), and was simply reassigned to other missionaries. Mike ended up returning home early from his mission (after 3 months of service), and spent several years trying to reconcile the shame/guilt that he felt, heal from his PTSD, and reconcile his same-sex sexuality. Mike consulted\u00A0North Star LDS\u00A0to help him manage his sexuality and remain faithful LDS, but this approach ultimately led him to a suicide attempt. Mike ultimately found peace and mental health by leaving the LDS church, and coming out as a gay man.",

      "description": "Today\u0027s interviewee was a graduate of Dartmouth University and a regular listener to Mormon Stories podcast when she decided to serve an LDS mission in 2012. Towards the latter half of her mission she began to experience depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation,\u00A0due in part to a culture of perfectionism within Mormonism, along with doubts she began to experience as a missionary (primarily around LGBT and historical issues). When she informed her mission president of her depressive symptoms, he allowed her only three visits to a talk therapist. Over time on her mission, she began to experience significant suicidal ideation, and on the final\u00A0month of her mission was self-admitted to a psychiatric behavioral health unit/hospital. \u00A0After her stay in the hospital, she decided that she no longer believed the church to be\u00A0true, and terminated her mission service early (a few weeks shy of completion). While the LDS church attempted to make her parents pay her hospital bills while a missionary, her parents declined and threatened to sue the church if they continued with such insistences. Eventually she decided to leave the LDS church, and has experienced significant improvement in her mental health, and elimination of her suicidality, as a result of this decision. \u00A0At present, she is engaged to be married and works as a nurse at Planned Parenthood in California.",

Tyler knew he was gay as a child, but struggled as a teen and adult to reconcile his sexuality with his LDS faith. \u00A0These struggles took Tyler to some sad/dark places, which were only exacerbated by his fame as a pop star. \u00A0At age 27 (around the release of Picture Show), Tyler seriously contemplated ending his life. In spite of these struggles, Tyler remained a full and literal believer in the LDS Church. \u00A0In 2014 Tyler\u00A0decided\u00A0that being a closeted gay man was contributing to his suicidality. \u00A0Consequently he came out as gay to his family, band, friends --\u00A0and to the world in Rolling Stone magazine\u00A0-- prior to the release of Pop Psychology. \u00A0From this point forward it was Tyler\u0027s full intent to find and marry a gay man, and to raise children\u00A0in the LDS church as a gay married Mormon. \u00A0 Then, in November of 2015, the LDS church\u00A0released its new policy branding\u00A0same-sex married Mormons as immediate apostates, and prohibiting children of same-sex married couples from being baptized. \u00A0This policy change sent Tyler into a tailspin, ultimately shattering his plans\u00A0as a believing, gay Mormon.\u00A0 In this three part interview, we explore:  Part 1: Tyler\u0027s early years as a young Mormon struggling with his sexuality.

Part 3: Tyler\u0027s faith crisis instigated by the LDS policy change, along with his current beliefs/views regarding the LDS Church.",

      "description": "When Race, Religion, and Sport Collide tells the story of Brandon Davies\u2019 dismissal from Brigham Young University\u2019s NCAA playoff basketball team to illustrate the thorny intersection of religion, race, and sport at BYU and beyond. Author Darron T. Smith analyzes the athletes dismissed through BYU\u2019s honor code violations and suggests that they are disproportionately African American, which has troubling implications. He ties these dismissals to the complicated history of negative views towards African Americans in the LDS faith. These honor code dismissals elucidate the challenges facing black athletes at predominantly white institutions. Weaving together the history of the black athlete in America and the experience of blackness in Mormon theology, When Race, Religion, and Sport Collide offers a timely and powerful analysis of the challenges facing African American athletes in the NCAA today. Dr. Darron T. Smith is a frequent political and cultural commentator on various issues of U.S. based issues of race, racism, and discrimination in forums ranging from Religion Dispatches, The New York Times and Chicago Tribune op-ed to ESPN\u0027s Outside the Lines. His research spans a wide myriad of topics on race including healthcare disparities, Religious studies, Race \u0026 Sports, and Race, Adoption and the Black Family. His current research focuses on health care workforce discrimination involving African American physicians and physician assistants. He is the co-author of White Parents, Black Children: Experiencing Transracial Adoption and co-editor of Black and Mormon.

A description of the book follows:  When Alex Cooper was fifteen years old, life was pretty ordinary in her sleepy suburban town and nice Mormon family. At church and at home, Alex was taught that God had a plan for everyone. But something was gnawing at her that made her feel different. These feelings exploded when she met Yvette, a girl who made Alex feel alive in a new way, and with whom Alex would quickly fall in love. Alex knew she was holding a secret that could shatter her family, her church community, and her life. Yet when this secret couldn\u2019t be hidden any longer, she told her parents that she was gay, and the nightmare began. She was driven from her home in Southern California to Utah, where, against her will, her parents handed her over to fellow Mormons who promised to save Alex from her homosexuality. For eight harrowing months, Alex was held captive in an unlicensed \u201Cresidential treatment program\u201D modeled on the many \u201Ctherapeutic\u201D boot camps scattered across Utah. Alex was physically and verbally abused, and many days she was forced to stand facing a wall wearing a heavy backpack full of rocks. Her captors used faith to punish and terrorize her. With the help of a dedicated legal team in Salt Lake City, Alex eventually escaped and made legal history in Utah by winning the right to live under the law\u2019s protection as an openly gay teenager. Alex is not alone; the headlines continue to splash stories about gay conversion therapy and rehabilitation centers that promise to \u201Csave\u201D teenagers from their sexuality.\u00A0Saving Alex\u00A0is a courageous memoir that tells Alex\u2019s story in the hopes that it will bring awareness and justice to this important issue.

Elizabeth found a committed partner 10 years ago, and married her partner 8 years ago. They are currently raising a daughter. Even though Elizabeth has not attended an LDS congregation since her early 30s, she was recently approached by her bishop (whom she\u0027d never met) in her driveway, and told that: 1) she needed to pray to God about whether or not to leave her wife and child, and that 2) if she wouldn\u0027t divorce\u00A0her wife and child, that she would face excommunication from the LDS church.\u00A0 This is Elizabeth\u0027s story.",

      "description": "In 2003, Matt Elggren and I met while working at Microsoft. \u00A0Together, along with others, we discovered troubling things about LDS Church history. For most of the past thirteen years, Matt has not attended church and has more or less quietly supported his believing wife and children. For fear of losing his family, Matt chose silence....as did his extended family. It was basically thirteen years of \u0022don\u0027t ask don\u0027t tell\u0022 with no hope of resolution for Matt. This changed in October of 2015 when Matt\u0027s\u00A0brother-in-law, Clay Christensen, began a 6-week slide into total disbelief after 51 years of devout membership, which included\u00A07 years as a high-level LDS Church employee. After losing his faith, Clay didn\u0027t choose silence. This is Matt and Clay\u0027s story.",

She has five\u00A0albums, the Sum of all Grace, Anchor, Winter Moon and Pocketful of Poetry and has collaborated on many others. \u00A0Mindy\u2019s music appears in film, television and commercials. Its has been described as \u2018tender, emotional, intelligent, and touchingly auto-biographical, fun flirty and heartfelt.\u2019\u00A0 Her vocal style is warm and rich; \u00A0each of her songs attest to the tremendous talent she has as both a musician and a lyricist. \u00A0She\u2019s also innovative and entrepreneurial and in 2012 was recognized as one of \u201CUtah\u2019s 40 Under 40\u201D in the Utah Valley Business Q Magazine. But Mindy also has a rich life story. Born into a large Mormon family she grew up in a faith tradition that could not keep up with her growing awareness of gender inequality and patriarchy. Mindy joins Gina\u00A0to discuss her life, her work, her family and her personal gender politics. In Parts One and Two of the\u00A0series John Dehlin interviewed pop artist\u00A0Mindy Gledhill\u00A0and classical pianist\u00A0Dustin Gledhill\u00A0regarding their new electronic synth-pop project called\u00A0Hive Riot. In Part 3\u00A0A Thoughtful Faith\u00A0podcast host Gina Colvin interviews Mindy about her faith, women\u2019s issues, and other dimensions of Mindy\u2019s experiences as a woman, mother, wife, pop artist, Mormon, and human. In Part 1\u00A0John explores Mindy and Dustin\u2019s respective stories as Mormons, along with their careers as successful musical performing artists. \u00A0Dustin also discusses his difficulties\u00A0as a gay Mormon (including his attempts to change his sexual orientation, driving him to the point of suicide), and Mindy discusses her journey to become an LGBT ally (partially through Dustin\u2019s influence). \u00A0\u00A0In\u00A0Part 2we discuss the\u00A0Hive Riot\u00A0project (which is the perfect\u00A0Christmas Gift for this holiday season\u2026along with\u00A0Mindy\u2019s Christmas album).",

      "description": "News broke last week that the LDS Church was adopting new policies aimed at married same-sex couples and their children. Mormons in a same-sex marriage will now be considered apostates and could be subject to disciplinary hearings and excommunication. Their children, meanwhile, will be barred from many of the faith\u2019s sacred rituals, unless they get permission from church\u2019s highest leaders. Monday, a panel of guests joined us to discuss the impacts and ramifications of these new church policies. GUESTS  Jennifer Dobner\u00A0is a journalist at the Salt Lake Tribune where she covers health care reform, Mormonism, polygamy, justice issues and more. John Dehlin has a Ph.D.\u00A0in psychology from Utah State University, focusing on religion, mental health, and the LGBT\u00A0Mormon experience. he co-led the largest study ever conducted on LGBT\u00A0Mormons that has been published in numerous scientific, peer reviewed journals, including the APA\u0027s\u00A0Journal of Counseling Psychology. He also produces and hosts the\u00A0Mormon Stories podcast.\u00A0He was excommunicated from the LDS Church in January of 2015. He was credited in several news reports for leaking information about the Church\u2019s new policy on married same-sex Mormons and their children. Kendall Wilcox is an openly gay and active Mormon. He\u2019s a co-founder of\u00A0Mormons Building Bridges, a group that works to build understanding between members of the LDS Church and the LGBT community. He\u2019s currently producing a documentary film about the experience of LGBT Mormons. It\u2019s called\u00A0Far Between. Mitch Mayne is an openly gay, active Mormon who served as executive secretary in the LDS bishopric in San Francisco through 2013.",

      "description": "In this episode sociologist and scholar Mark Juergensmeyer, Ph.D. explains his reasons for boycotting Brigham Y0ung University over its policy to expell LDS students who lose their testimony of the LDS Church\u0027s truthfulness.  \u00A0   \u00A0   \u00A0  The text of Dr. Juergensmeyer\u0027s letter is as follows:  Prof Elizabeth ClarkAssociate DirectorInternational Center for Law and Religion StudiesBrigham Young University Dear Elizabeth: I regret that I will be unable to participate in the Law and Religion Symposium that is being held this week at BYU. It was an honor to be invited to speak at this event, and as you know I made every effort to make room in my schedule to be there on Tuesday. My decision not to participate is an act of conscience based on BYU\u2019s policy of expelling any Mormon student who leaves the faith or converts to another religion. Alas I was unaware of this policy until this weekend when it was brought to my attention. I have decided that it would be hypocritical of me to participate in a conference in which the issue of religious liberty is paramount when the institution sponsoring it fundamentally violates this principle in its policies towards Mormon students. As I understand it, non-Mormons are allowed to enroll in BYU, and they are welcome to convert to the Mormon faith if they wish, but if \u00A0Mormon students change their religious affiliation they lose their scholarship, their campus housing and jobs, and are expelled from school even if they are months away from graduation. In making this decision I mean no disrespect to you, the Center with which you are affiliated, or the other participants in this week\u2019s conference. I know that many faculty members at BYU are opposed to this policy and are quietly working to change it. I applaud them, and hope that my decision will be taken as a sign of support for those within BYU who are seeking change. I appreciation your dilemma and admire your persistence. Again, thanks for the honor of the invitation. I hope that I will be invited back to BYU and will be able to accept some time in the future when this policy restricting religious freedom is lifted.

She is the mother of 5, a pianist, a photographer, and a lover of science, truth, and sensibility. \u00A0Jamie is the author of a recent article entitled \u0022DNA and Mormonism.\u0022 Simon Southerton completed a PhD in plant science at the University of Sydney in 1989. For 15 years he worked at CSIRO, Australia\u2019s national research organization, where he\u00A0led its forest genomics team. In 2014, in partnership with his brother Bob, he formed a CSIRO spin off company named Gondwana Genomics. Gondwana provides DNA testing services to tree breeders to enable them to select better trees when they are seedlings. Simon first encountered DNA research on Native Americans and Polynesians in 1998while serving as a bishop in Brisbane, Australia. In response to Mormon apologetics in 2004 he published\u00A0Losing a Lost Tribe, which explores the origins of Amerindian and Polynesian DNA and its implications for LDS beliefs arising from the Book of Mormon. Simon is married to Jane who is an English teacher/librarian. They live in Canberra along with their five wonderful offspring. \u00A0Simon\u0027s\u00A0blog on DNA and Mormonism can be found here.

He is currently\u00A0founder and owner of Cognitive Architectures for Learning, a company that understands cell by cell and synapse by synapse what learning and memory are and how to build devices from this knowledge. Eric has also run a number of church courses and seminar series bringing together science and religion. He\u00A0is the proud father of a female nanotech physicist. He is also a geneticist and biochemist with expertise in genes and their enzymes across many organisms. When there is time, Eric is a swimmer, photographer and chef.",

      "description": "Dr. Dave Christian has served\u00A0as a\u00A0psychologist to believing and post-Mormons\u00A0for decades. In this episode, Dave\u00A0begins by discussing his LDS pioneer ancestry, and his early years in the LDS church as a faithful, science-loving boy from St. George. \u00A0He then discusses early doubts he began to have regarding his LDS faith as he explored the field of epistemology (the study of how we know things). \u00A0In spite of these doubts, Dave chose to serve an LDS mission in the Australia Sydney Mission (1979 to 1981 timeframe), and during this time struggled with the pressure tactics\u00A0employed by his mission president (Orson Wright). \u00A0Ultimately, to Dave\u0027s surprise, Orson Wright was removed from the mission for propositioning the sister missionaries of the mission to be his polygamous wives -- and\u00A0the reasons for President Wright\u0027s removal from the mission were covered up by LDS Church leadership including Thomas S. Monson and Joseph B. Wirthlin. This episode provides a fascinating look into the issues\u00A0of: 1) how we come to feel as though we \u0022know\u0022 things, and 2) how LDS church members (and members of other religious faiths) can be manipulated into claiming religious knowledge through emotional means. \u00A0 Dr. Christian is available to provide psychotherapy in Utah, and Skype-based coaching outside of Utah. To contact Dr. Christian for an appointment,\u00A0check out his contact information here.",

Her mother converted to the LDS Church when Julienna was a child, and credits the LDS church with saving her life. Julienna was raised a highly devout Mormon girl in Belgium, and served a mission on Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah. After a life of full devotion to the LDS Church, Julinenna began to experience cracks in her orthodoxy testimony when her husband began questioning/doubting the LDS Church\u0027s truth claims. While Julienna remains committed to LDS Church activity, she recently penned an article with the Salt Lake Tribune entitled\u00A0\u0022What do progressive Mormons want? A dialogue about change.\u0022 In this two-part episode for Mormon Stories Podcast Julienna tells her story, and discusses possible changes that the LDS Church can make to become a healthier organization for its members.",

      "description": "Julienna Viegas-Haws has a fascinating story. Her mother is from the Belgian Congo. She was raised in Belgium. Her mother converted to the LDS Church when Julienna was a child, and credits the LDS church with saving her life. Julienna was raised a highly devout Mormon girl in Belgium, and served a mission on Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah. After a life of full devotion to the LDS Church, Julinenna began to experience cracks in her orthodoxy testimony when her husband began questioning/doubting the LDS Church\u0027s truth claims. While Julienna remains committed to LDS Church activity, she recently penned an article with the Salt Lake Tribune entitled\u00A0\u0022What do progressive Mormons want? A dialogue about change.\u0022 In this two-part episode for Mormon Stories Podcast Julienna tells her story, and discusses possible changes that the LDS Church can make to become a healthier organization for its members.",

      "description": "For decades, and\u00A0heavily\u00A0over\u00A0the past ten years, Mormon historians, podcasters, and critics have been urging\u00A0the LDS Church to be more open and honest about Joseph Smith\u0027s use of folk magic and a peep stone/hat in his\u00A0production\u00A0of the Book of Mormon text. On August 4th, 2015 the LDS Church released the third volume of the Joseph Smith Papers, which includes the printer\u0027s manuscript of the Book of Mormon. It also released photos of the seer stone that Joseph Smith used as a\u00A0scryer\u00A0to search for buried treasure, and that he also placed in a hat to produce the text for the Book of Mormon. \u00A0(for detailed\u00A0discussions of Joseph\u0027s use of a seer stone in the Book of Mormon\u0027s creation, see\u00A0CES Letter,\u00A0Mormon Think, or D.

She\u00A0also has an incredibly fascinating story, which includes an adolescence of considerable trouble-making, a scandalous early divorce from her own bishop/husband, and several other stories of general delight and intrigue.

She was deeply committed to the church as a teen, but she also excelled in school and dreamed of obtaining a Ph.D. in Genetics. After receiving the prestigious Gordon B. Hinckley scholarship at BYU, she married Carson Calderwood after her freshman year. Although she remained devoutly LDS for well over decade, Marisa struggled with feeling like she lost herself and her dreams once she married Carson, especially after going through the LDS temple and receiving the impression that women were less than men in the LDS church. Over the next several years Marisa had four children with Carson, but she also began having chronic headaches, and sinking deeper and deeper into depression. Finally, once Marisa began to allow herself to consider the possibility that the LDS church might not be true, she began feeling better about herself, her headaches subsided, and she and Carson found a happiness and an authenticity in their marriage that they never knew before. Today Marisa and her husband Carson are being threatened with excommunication for speaking openly about their doubts and disbelief. They expect to receive their summons to a disciplinary council within the coming week. This is Marisa\u0027s story.",

In contrast with the types of challenges presented to people by \u201Coutsiders\u201D to their faith, a change in stance and the new worldview presented by those who were once in sync with you (or at least perceived to be in sync) can be far more devastating. Their shifts often feel very personal, a rejection of something we hold most dear. And they have no excuse! They once knew what we know and now challenge and say they are seeing more clearly or experiencing something else more richly? For those who are the ones who have shifted, a loved one\u2019s negative reactions to that person\u2019s change also can feel quite personal. Why don\u2019t they trust me that I\u2019m on a good path, that I have information or insights that open the world to me in new ways? Why are they choosing stubbornness and clinging to ideology and dogma over really exploring and staying in close relationship with me no matter where my faith journey takes me? How can we see these and other dynamics more clearly? What is \u201Cour\u201D responsibility as those who have been the one whose perspectives have shifted? How can both parties better understand the challenges of this situation and learn to have compassion for each other? What are key virtues needed in such relationships? What are some \u201Cdos\u201D and \u201Cdon\u2019ts\u201D for negotiating this difficult interpersonal terrain? Please listen and then share your stories and insights in the comments section below!",

      "description": "Skip to Main ContentSearch This Site:  Main Navigati2014 McMurrin Lecture on Religion and Culture with Kathleen Flake \u0022The LDS Intellectual Tradition: A Study on Three Lives\u0022April 11, 2014 Symposium: \u0022Faith and Reason, Conscience and Conflict:\u00A0The Paths of Lowell Bennion, Sterling McMurrin, and Obert Tanner\u0022April 12, 2014\u00A0     McMurrin Lecture:\u00A0In her lecture, Flake defines an intellectual as one who loves and is committed to the life of the mind, one for whom thought is both a delight and a necessity, a source as well as means for human flourishing. This does not mean a life without conflicts, as illustrated by three intellectuals - Lowell Bennion, Sterling McMurrin, and Obert Tanner. Flake will consider their intellectual lives in relation to the religious culture from which they came. Doing so will tell us something about whether there is a Mormon intellectual tradition and, if so, what are its distinctive features. Kathleen Flake holds the Richard L. Bushman Chair of Mormon Studies at the University of Virginia. She is the author of\u00A0The Politics of American Religious Identity: The Seating of Senator Reed Smoot, Mormon Apostle\u00A0(University of North Carolina Press, 2004). Professor Flake has been awarded grants from the Mellon Foundation, Lily Endowment, Pew Charitable Trusts, and American Philosophical Society.\u00A0 She has held office in the American Academy of Religion, the American Society of Church History, and the Southeastern Commission for the Study of Religion. Frequently invited to comment on Mormonism in the news, she is also a panelist for the Washington Post/Newsweek \u0022On Faith\u0022 blog. \u00A0  Symposium:\u00A0Mormonism is often seen as a religion of conformity, with a hierarchy in tight control of members\u2019 beliefs and behavior. Yet this perspective misses a rich tradition of intellectual independence and principled dissent. With an eye to the present and future, the Tanner Humanities Center will offer a unique symposium on the lives and legacies of Sterling M. McMurrin, Obert C. Tanner, and Lowell L. Bennion. Their stories reveal the tensions between faith and reason, conformity and dissent.\u00A0This symposium will mark the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Obert C. and Grace A. Tanner Humanities Center. Panels include \u201CChallenge of Conscience: Sterling M. McMurrin\u201D (9:00-10:30 AM), with Bob Goldberg (Chair), Jack Newell, James Clayton, and Brian Birch; \u201CChallenge of Loyalty: Lowell Bennion\u201D (11:00 AM-12:30 PM), with Irene Fisher (Chair), Greg Prince, Tony Morgan, Sam Allen, and Emma Lou Thayne; and \u201CChallenge of Faith: Obert C. Tanner\u201D (1:30-3:00 PM), with Greg Thompson (Chair), Kent Murdock, Bob Goldberg, and Grethe Peterson. A concluding panel, titled \u201CPublic Men and the Challenge of Their Private Worlds\u201D (3:30-5:00 PM), will focus upon the personal, intellectual, and working relationships that existed among these men, with panelists Linda King Newell (Chair), Carolyn Tanner Irish, Ellen Bennion Stone, Charlotte Hansen Terry, and Bill McMurrin. \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 These three intellectuals who shared a determination to act were rooted in Mormonism, but possessed distinctive visions that penetrated beyond their treasured religious heritage and drove them to embrace\u2014and respond to\u2014the pressing social, cultural, and political issues of their time.\u00A0 With mutual respect, but using distinctive methods, Tanner, McMurrin and Bennion shared a passion for justice and impatience with racial discrimination in their church and across American society. \u00A0At various points in their careers, they served the LDS Church, the University of Utah, their state, and the nation in pursuit of their visions of a more enlightened and humane society. Pursuing justice and adhering to conscience brought its own rewards, but also exacted a cost. As Director of the University of Utah\u2019s LDS Institute of Religion, Lowell Bennion chafed at supporting church authorities in their denial of the priesthood to African American men. \u00A0Largely over this issue, he surrendered\u00A0this post, swallowed his disappointment, and vigorously channeled his religious instincts into serving the needy in Salt Lake City.\u00A0 Sterling McMurrin chose to proclaim himself a heretic and relished that identity, but lost friendships and some sense of community. Obert Tanner, a closet skeptic, muffled his doubt and kept his silence to play prominent roles in the life of his country, state, and city. Symposium speakers and panelists will not only examine the specific, contemporary impacts of Lowell Bennion, Sterling McMurrin, and O.C. Tanner, but also consider their enduring legacies on the issues facing the Mormon Church today: the inclusion of women more fully in church leadership circles, the need to face painful facets of church history more honestly, the challenge of retaining the engagement or affiliation of socially and culturally liberal members and young adults, the quest to understand the effects of new technologies on Mormon practices and beliefs, and other concerns of our time. A concluding panel will focus upon the personal, intellectual, and working relationships that existed among these men.\u00A0 The Tanner Center is partnering with the College of Humanities, Smith-Pettit Foundation, and Michael Morris to bring you this event.",

It creates, they argue, an impossible situation where students are seemingly forced to choose between their integrity and the education they have worked and payed for. In this episode, we\u0027re joined by several members of Free BYU, an organization dedicated to raising awareness of what they consider a lack of religious freedom within the Church Educational System. We discuss with Free BYU leaders the Honor Code as it relates to religious freedom, ecclesiastical endorsements and how to handle a faith transition while at a church school. We\u0027ll also talk with two current students as they talk about how they are trying to navigate their faith transitions while attending BYU.",

He explains his research about how Mormon identity is different in American context: stronger, more collective, more integrated, and with stricter boundaries. He discusses implications for how Mormonism interacts with politics, and also for the identity and religious options of liberal and disaffected Mormons.",
