      "description": "Lara and Carey to the livestream for another rendition of SUP AFTER DARK, recapping part deux of the RHOSLC season 6 reunion (live with chat!) First, they discuss an update in Beckxit, the liberation of Amanda Batula, Club Chalamet\u2019s new pivot, and a divisive episode of INDUSTRY. Back on the reunion, Angie\u2019s scroll reveals Babygirl Lisa\u2019s Reality Von Teased-esque alter ego, as Meredith continues to let her Plum Sister flail against the firing squad. Britani arrives to muted reaction, as Mary answers for the cult allegations and gives a sad but potentially hopeful update on Robert Jr\u2019s struggle with addiction. Lisa lobs a vague accusation at Bronwyn over Todd\u2019s Dubai activities; and its curtains for Heather and Meredith\u2019s friendship. Then, Meredith \u2014 gearing up to address PlaneGate \u2014 begins her most lawyer ass chess play yet, diverting from her own allegedly feral behavior to weave a tale of Britani, bigoted nail techs and Yelp reviews. The countdown to the end continues\u2026 Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",
