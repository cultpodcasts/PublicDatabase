      "description": "Vanessa and Liz discuss their plans to see Liz\u0027s father after finding out he may be alive. \n\n19 years ago The Church of Scientology told Liz her father was dead. Her family all thought he was. Until June 6, 2023 when Liz received a phone call from Scientology telling her that she must pay her fathers \u201Cfreeloader\u2019s debt\u201D. \n\nThis Scientology publication is frequently, among Scientology parishioners, referred to as just \u2018Admin Dictionary\u2019.\n\nPer Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard  \n         \n\u201CFREELOADER, 1. any person who has failed to complete a staff contract at a Sea Org or Scn org or mission is a freeloader. This includes persons legally dismissed from employment through Scn and Sea Org justice procedures such as Committees of Evidence and Fitness Boards on the Sea Org. It includes persons who blow or desert their post and organization of then own accord. It includes automatically all persons who request a leave of absence from the org or the Sea Organization for one year or longer. (BPL 13 Oct 72R)  2. a Sea Org mission to orgs in the U.S. uncovered \u201Cundermanned\u201D as a reason for low stats. According to this mission many people had joined staffs, signed contracts, gotten free services and then went off staff. This is nice work if one can get it. It leaves the good guys burdened with tech delivery with no proper income. Such contract breakers are to be designated freeloaders. They are ineligible for further services at any org until they have corrected their overt. (HCO PL 13 Oct 72)\u201D\n        \nA freeloader\u2019s debt is collected when a member of the Sea Organization decides they no longer want to be a Sea Org Member.\n\nThe SEA ORGANIZATION (also known as the Sea Org) is a core group of Church of Scientology staff members who have signed a billion-year pledge of service to Scientology.[3]:\u200A53\u200A All Scientology management organizations are controlled exclusively by members of the Sea Org.[4] David Miscavige, the de facto leader of Scientology, is the highest-ranking Sea Org officer, holding the rank of captain.\n\n\n\nStay tuned. \n\n#WheresBobFerris #SPTV #Cult  \n\nFROM SILENT BIRTH TO DISCONNECTION. \n\nOur names are Vanessa and Elysia, and we are excited to share our journey with you. We were raised in the Church of Scientology, and our experiences have shaped us in unique ways. Unfortunately, we both lost parts of our family due to the practice of disconnection, which has left a lasting impact on our lives, as has being raised within the culture of Scientology. We are now invested in keeping up our mental health.\n\nPer the founder of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard:\n\nA degraded being is not a suppressive as he can have case gain. But he is so PTS that he works for suppressives only. Degraded beings, taking a cue from SP associates, instinctively resent, hate and seek to obstruct any person in charge of anything.

      "description": "After seeing this channel, reaching out, creating connections with Elysia and Vanessa, Liz Ferris asked for a special kind of support from Vanessa of @DegradedDaughters . Liz experienced post traumatic distress due to her former abuse as a member of the Sea Org, which included physical labor and digging grave like trenches. \n\nWe believe peer support is important. Vanessa accompanied Liz Ferris to a secretive Scientology location in hopes of finding her father. Vanessa provided emotion support, along with Liz\u0027s partner Keri and Liz\u0027s private investigator Jeffrey Augustine. \n\nYou will begin to see the full story unravel as we release and document the *very real and currently in practice Fair Game policies and intelligence tactics* put in practice by Hubbard long ago, which are still applied with exacting force to an entire generation of second generation former members of Scientology... who sometimes just want to know that their parent is okay. \n\n#WHERESBOBFERRIS #truecrime #scientology\n\nFROM SILENT BIRTH TO DISCONNECTION. \n\nOur names are Vanessa and Elysia, and we are excited to share our journey with you.
