To \u0022open the door for all the abused women and GIRLS\u0022 \nGlobally endorsed and promoted by Oprah Winfrey as a miraculous spiritual healer and Man of God.John of God was considered a \u0027BIG MAN\u0027.  Many were taken in by Oprah\u0027s false advertisements and flocked to John of God\u0027s center in Abadiania, Brazil. Not reported at the time by Oprah were these facts: John of God was already multi millionaire dealing in illegal businesses of money laundering and smuggling. He owned considerable real estate in Abadiania and controlled this small backwoods town. His \u0027spiritual\u0027 act was nothing more than a charade. And worse of all, he used his power and influence to sexual abuse hundreds of women and children.\n\nZahira was the first woman to report publicly to have been sexually abused by psychic John of God. A real HERO. \n\nHer statement:\n\u0022I\u0027m really relieved to know how many women have come forward since the show. So, I am feeling very positive about that because that\u0027s the reason I decided to give the interview in the first place. It was to open a door for all the abused women and GIRLS to come forward..

      "description": "This fluff piece video interview by Oprah aired  in March 2013. It was highly uncritical to promote John of God as a \u0027Miracle Healer\u0027 and divine man who could channel spirits. In light of Dec 2018 Sex abuse charges ( over 300 women) against John of God, Oprah removed all traces of her connection with John of God from her OWN and Oprah.com sites.
