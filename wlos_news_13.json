      "description": "Members of a Rutherford County church face new accusations. Michael Lowry says Word of Faith Fellowship learned that he is gay. He says in August of 2011\u00A0 he was assaulted on church grounds as he was read scripture because of his sexuality. Lowry filed a report with law enforcement but left town.\u00A0 He\u0027s now back and pursuing the charges.\u00A0 Jerry Cooper is a former member of the church and came back with Lowry. Both men say church members followed them when they learned they were back in town. The Word of Faith members have been charged with stalking. Word of Faith Fellowship responded in full by saying:\u00A0\u0022Concerning the allegations of Michael Roy Lowry, there is no truth in them. Knowing Michael very well, we believe he has been greatly influenced and persuaded to make these false allegations. The allegations made by Jerry Butcher (Cooper) are completely false.\u00A0 He has made threats to destroy our church and the pastor. In February 2009 Jerry Butcher (Cooper) was convicted of Second Degree Trespass for disrupting our church service and refusing to leave. He was ordered by a district court judge at that time to not be found on or about the premises of Word of Faith Fellowship. He continues to contact us repeatedly through unwanted e-mails, harassing phone calls, text messages, and by driving about our church property\n\n_______________\nFollow WLOS on social media:\n\nWLOS ABC 13 News on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/News13/\nWLOS ABC 13 News on Twitter: https://twitter.com/WLOS_13\nWLOS ABC 13 News on Instagram: https://instagram.com/wlos_13\n\nSubscribe to WLOS on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/ABC13Channel/?sub_confirmation=1 \n\nListen to AnchorMOMS, the Podcast: \nhttps://wlos.com/news/anchormoms/anchormoms-the-podcast\n\nWatch more top local news stories: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kk8Ge6UXHJs\u0026list=PLkVbaoT-aYbIvnEpR0Ct5QQQqYaORUSUH\n\nFor all of the day\u2019s top local and national news, visit http://www.wlos.com\nWatch our live newscasts and other live video at https://wlos.com/watch\n\nHave a news tip?
