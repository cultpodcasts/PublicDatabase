      "description": "An appeal committee, to review the decision to have me disfellowshipped (i.e. shunned) for disagreeing with church leadership. \n\nSadly, the battery on my hidden camera failed me about 40 minutes in, but not surprisingly, the decision to disfellowship was upheld. \n\nJudicial Committee Part 1: https://youtu.be/bkbO_lYlPRQ\nJudicial Committee Part 2: https://youtu.be/mB-KweFxBRc\n\nWhen I stopped believing in the Organization, I knew that the only likely outcomes were either disfellowshipping, or spending the rest of my life pretending to be something I\u0027m not, as though I were ashamed of simple logic and skepticism. I went to this meeting, not to avoid being disfellowshipped, but to challenge the elders to justify their immoral actions, and to expose the things they do in secret to the harsh light of day.\n\nPlease excuse the poor camera work, the camera was hidden in my shirt pocket.",
