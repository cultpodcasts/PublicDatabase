      "description": "Like hundreds before her, Katherine Daniel was sent by her parents to a school for troubled teens. The Academy at Ivy Ridge claimed to use therapy and recreational activities to help its students. Instead, teens suffered mental and physical abuse in a program that operated like a cult. Years later, Katherine and her former classmates rummaged through the files and videotapes left behind in the abandoned school. Their goal was to come to terms with what happened to them within its walls and hold those responsible to account. The Netflix documentary series The Program: Cons, Cults and Kidnapping is a gripping look at the so-called Troubled Teen Industry by those traumatized from its practices. It also explores the company whose business model is to keep parents paying huge fees while their children suffer horrors at the hands of their schools\u2019 staff. In this episode of You Can\u0027t Make This Up, host Rebecca Lavoie interviews Director Katherine Kubler. SPOILER ALERT! If you haven\u0027t watched The Program: Cons, Cults and Kidnapping yet, make sure to add it to your watch-list before listening on. Listen to more from Netflix Podcasts .",

      "description": "With its expensive online courses, Twin Flames Universe promised members would find their true loves. The online cult was better at making money than finding love, so leaders Jeff and Shaleia Ayons began matchmaking its followers with one another. Though many had identified as straight and cis, they were paired with same sex partners and prodded to rethink their gender identity. The Netflix documentary series Escaping Twin Flames examines the controversial online community, brings us into Jeff and Sheleia\u2019s online classroom, and tells the stories of those hurt by its teachings. The series asks whether anything can actually be done to stop it from taking advantage of people who are only looking for love. Host Rebecca Lavoie interviews filmmakers Cecilia Peck and Inbal Lessner. SPOILER ALERT!
