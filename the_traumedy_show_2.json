      "description": "**This episode contains content that may be alarming for some listeners, including depictions of domestic violence, financial abuse and cult-related trauma. If you or a loved one are struggling in these areas, please visit the resources below for help and more information.\u00A0\n\nThis week on The Traumedy Show, Emily Rose, founder of The Mama Wilder Foundation, details her story of surviving domestic violence, financial abuse and the isolation that came with marrying into a religious cult. She takes us through the painful unraveling of that life\u2014how control was disguised as faith and how she ultimately found the strength to leave.\n\nBut her story doesn\u2019t end there. Emily fought her ex-husband in criminal and family court for domestic violence and for custody of her children. And, in a stunning turn, her now-husband helped her take back her power\u2014by cross-examining her narcissistic mother in the courtroom. It\u2019s a story of pain, escape, the pursuit of justice and the kind of love that helps you rebuild.\n\nResources:\n\nNational Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233\n\nECMZCVPCMVC1N8CM",
