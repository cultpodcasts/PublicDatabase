      "description": "Mary Cosby is sitting in the hot seat right now. And it\u2019s not for her antics on The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City. But rather, all eyes are on her personal life as a pastor at Faith Temple Pentecostal Church.\n\nTLC recently released a series called The Cult of the Real Housewife (2026). With Mary as the subject, former members of her church haul allegations at her for three episodes straight. From an alleged affair with someone in the congregation to pressuring members to give more than their means, it is a bombshell of a show. Mary has quickly been hit with backlash and now, she\u2019s addressed it head-on.\n\n#MaryCrosby #lifetime  #TheCultofRealHousewives #TheRealHousewivesofSaltLakeCity",
