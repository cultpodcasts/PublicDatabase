New clothes, a road trip, a little light Bible study\u2026 it was all pretty standard. Until, years later, her sister sent her a text.\n\nRachel tells the story of how a childhood curriculum called the Wisdom Booklets led to a trip into a very conservative Christian organization, complete with khaki skirts, strict dress codes, and something called \u201Cumbrellas of authority.\u201D\n\n\uD83D\uDC49 Ever realized something strange way after the fact?
