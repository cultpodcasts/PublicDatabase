      "title": "THE TRUTH ABOUT HUMAN TRAFFICKING: Today\u2019s Modern Slavery \u0026 What Everyone Needs to Know",
      "description": "#HumanTrafficking #ModernSlavery #EndHumanTrafficking \n\nJust a heads up: This episode contains discussions of grooming, coercive control, and sex trafficking. Some may find it upsetting. We encourage you to take care of yourself.\n\nThis episode is dedicated to Virginia Giuffre. And all survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and human trafficking.\n\nWhen survivors of sex trafficking bravely step forward to share their truth, how do we respond? Do we stand with them, or do we doubt and dismiss their experiences? What happens when the media, the justice system, and powerful industries get a hold of a survivor\u2019s story?\n\nToday, we dive deep into the complex, often hidden reality of modern slavery happening all around us\u2014in our neighborhoods, in the shadows of industries we engage with daily, and especially within the world of sex trafficking. More than 40 million people worldwide are trapped in human trafficking, with one in four being children. Sex trafficking, a devastating form of this crime, involves the exploitation of vulnerable individuals through force, fraud, or coercion for commercial sex acts\u2014and minors involved cannot legally consent at all.\n\nLisa Phillips welcomes Davina Durgana, PhD,  an award-winning human rights statistician and expert who has shaped global understanding of modern slavery. Davina brings a crucial data-driven perspective on how sex trafficking thrives where social safety nets and oversight fail, and how traffickers act as entrepreneurial predators exploiting sexual and labor vulnerabilities alike.\n\nTogether, Lisa and Davina unpack the myths versus realities of human trafficking\u2014 exploring the types of coercion survivors face, the trafficking ring ecosystems, the powerful economics behind exploitation, and why survivors\u2019 voices are vital in driving awareness and systemic change. They also highlight the retraumatization survivors endure due to stigma, legal challenges, and lack of adequate support, often keeping them trapped in cycles of abuse.\n\nThis episode calls on listeners to educate themselves on trafficking signs, understand how demand fuels exploitation\u2014particularly in commercial sex\u2014and hold institutions accountable, from corporations to governments, so trafficking becomes prohibitively difficult and unprofitable. Because the fight against modern slavery\u2014and sex trafficking\u2014starts with believing survivors, standing up for justice, and transforming communities to protect the most vulnerable.\n\n\u201CFrom now on, what I would like is that we have a standard that changes American society\u0027s view of the human worth, that if we see individual lives as valuable as our own, then it doesn\u0027t stand that we can also exploit them for labor or exploit them for sex.\u201D\n\n\nAbout Davina Durgana:\nDavina Durgana, PhD is an award-winning international human rights statistician who has developed leading global models to assess risk and vulnerability to modern slavery.\u00A0\n\nDr. Davina Durgana was a Founding Author of the Global Slavery Index and Contributing Founding Author of the UN\u2019s Global Estimates of Modern Slavery.\u00A0\n\nShe is the Director of Free the Slaves, the oldest anti-trafficking organization in the United States and is currently working on a book on family court reform for domestic violence survivors and their children.\u00A0\n\nFollow Davina Durgana:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/davinadurgana/\n\nFollow Me, Lisa Phillips: \nWebsite: https://www.lisaphillips.la\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/iamlisaphillips/\nFNO Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/fromnowonpod/\nFNO TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fromnowonpod\nFNO Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/fromnowonpod\nFNO X: https://twitter.com/fromnowonpod\n\nFrom Now On is produced by LA PHILLIPS MEDIA.

      "description": "#marilynmanson #SurvivorStories #rockstar\n\nJust a heads up: This episode contains discussions of grooming of a minor, sexual assault, and coercive control. Some may find it upsetting. We encourage you to take care of yourself.\n\nWhat really happens when the spotlight fades and the show is over? For years, iconic rock musician Marilyn Manson cultivated an image of rebellion and shock, but behind that fa\u00E7ade lies a decades-long history of abuse and predatory behavior targeting underage fans.\n\nIn this episode, Lisa Phillipsm invites Bianca Allaine Kyne who exposes the chilling details of what went on behind the closed doors of Manson\u2019s tour bus. In 1995, Bianca was just 16 when she, along with younger girls\u2014some as young as 13\u2014was invited onto Manson\u2019s bus after a concert. What began as a dream come true for devoted teenage fans quickly turned into a nightmare of manipulation, violation, and threats. Bianca bravely recounts how Manson and bandmate Jeordie White (Twiggy Ramirez) deliberately singled out vulnerable girls, asked personal questions, and used fan clubs to extract addresses and contact details. The grooming was methodical and predatory, leaving Bianca and other young girls isolated, ashamed, abused and silenced.\n\nBut Manson\u2019s pattern of abuse didn\u0027t stop there: his violent, degrading behavior has been corroborated by fellow survivors, including high-profile voices like Evan Rachel Wood, and by testimony about band members and crew being subjected to assault and humiliation. Despite mounting accusations and lawsuits, the music industry has historically looked the other way, settling behind closed doors and allowing predators to remain in the spotlight.\n\nIn this conversation, Bianca shares why she kept her story hidden for so long, the shame and self-blame she carried as a teenage fan betrayed by her idol, and how solidarity among survivors\u2014finally speaking out\u2014has become a catalyst for demanding true accountability. Lisa and Bianca call attention to the patterns of grooming and calculated selection of vulnerable girls; the complicity of institutions that enable abuse; and why, even now, many survivors feel blamed, judged, or disbelieved when they dare to share the truth.\n\nThis episode is a call to listen\u2014truly listen\u2014to survivors, to challenge the culture of silence, and to ensure no other young fan becomes prey behind the glamour of rock stardom.\n\n\u201CFrom now on, I hope that we can all continue this conversation and this topic. We just have to keep fighting the good fight.\u201D\n\nAbout Bianca Allaine Kyne:\nBianca Allaine Kyne is a model, actor, producer, and survivor.

      "description": "#MaleSurvivor #OneInSix #childhoodtrauma \n\nJust a heads up: This episode contains discussions of child sexual assault, grooming, violence, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation. Some may find it upsetting. We encourage you to take care of yourself.\n\nWhat happens when a boy is forced to carry a secret so heavy it shapes every part of his life? How do we respond when male survivors of childhood sexual abuse break their silence about grooming, violence, and the lifelong impact of trauma?\n\nToday, we\u2019re confronting the widespread crisis that affects one in six boys before they turn eighteen\u2014a staggering number that is too often hidden by shame, stigma, and disbelief. Most assaults are committed not by strangers, but by people the child knows and trusts, making it even harder for boys to speak out. Society\u2019s expectations of masculinity tell boys to be strong and silent, leaving them isolated and unheard, and allowing the cycle of violence and trauma to continue.\n\nLisa welcomes Nathan Spiteri\u2014author, advocate, and survivor\u2014who was just eight years old when his world was shattered by a stranger. Nathan takes us step-by-step through the grooming tactics that trap children in fear, the violence that follows, and the toxic shame that warps self-worth and behavior for years to come. He shares how the cycle of abuse and violence led to addiction, self-destruction, and profound confusion about love and belonging.\n\nThis episode is not just about pain, but about the power of speaking out. Nathan and Lisa explore how vulnerability is an act of bravery, how naming abuse is the first step toward healing, and why it\u2019s time to end the stigma that keeps male survivors in the shadows. Nathan\u2019s journey shows that breaking the cycle of violence and healing from childhood trauma is possible\u2014with honest conversation, support, and the courage to reclaim your story.\n\nThis episode calls on listeners to listen, believe, and stand with all survivors\u2014because progress begins with breaking the silence and ending the cycle of violence for good.\n\u201CFrom now on, this is me. From now on, I am who I am, I can\u0027t change it.\u201D\n\nAbout Nathan Spiteri:\n\nNathan Spiteri is the author of Toy Cars, a TEDx speaker, advocate, filmmaker, actor, and screenwriter. Nathan Spiteri is also a sexual abuse survivor. Born in Australia, Nathan was sexually abused as a child, threatened with his life and that of his family.\n\nHe is one of the very few voices of male sexual abuse to speak so openly and publicly, and wants to start the conversation and change the narrative surrounding this global epidemic.\n\nFollow Nathan Spiteri:\nWebsite: https://www.nathanspiteri.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/nathanspiteri/\n\nFollow Me, Lisa Phillips: \nWebsite: https://www.lisaphillips.la\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/iamlisaphillips/\nFNO Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/fromnowonpod/\nFNO TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fromnowonpod\nFNO Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/fromnowonpod\nFNO X: https://twitter.com/fromnowonpod\n\nFrom Now On is produced by LA PHILLIPS MEDIA.

      "description": "#consent #BodyAutonomy #childhoodtrauma\n\nJust a heads up: This episode contains discussions of sexual assault and coercive control. Some may find it upsetting. We encourage you to take care of yourself.\n\nHow do we equip kids and teens with the tools they need to protect themselves and build healthy relationships? What happens when we break the silence around consent, body autonomy, and sexual abuse prevention?\n\nToday, we\u2019re confronting the myths and silences that leave young people vulnerable. Too often, survivors of childhood sexual abuse grow up without the language or support to process their trauma. Many never learn what consent truly means, or how to recognize and assert their own boundaries. Instead, shame and secrecy are passed down through generations, leaving children and teens to navigate relationships and intimacy without guidance.\n\nLisa welcomes Logan Cooper, a licensed mental health counselor, trauma professional, and survivor, who draws on both her personal and professional experience to empower families. Logan and Lisa discuss the long-term impact of unprocessed childhood trauma, the dangerous myths about sex and consent that persist in families, schools, and media, and how parents and caregivers can start age-appropriate conversations about body autonomy\u2014even with very young children.\n\nThis episode offers practical strategies for teaching consent, recognizing the difference between safe surprises and unsafe secrets, and helping kids and teens build self-worth and confidence. Lisa and Logan explore how education, open dialogue, and modeling healthy boundaries can break cycles of shame and silence, giving the next generation the tools they need to stay safe and thrive.\n\nThis conversation is for every parent, educator, and survivor who wants to create a world where children are empowered, informed, and protected.\n\n\u201CFrom now on, I will listen to my body over what anybody else tells me about my body. I trust my body first.\u201D\n\nAbout Logan Cooper:\nLogan Cooper is a Mental Health Counselor \u0026 a Certified Clinical Trauma Professional licensed in the state of Florida. Logan draws on her personal experiences of domestic violence and sexual trauma as well as her professional training to provide advocacy \u0026 empowerment to fellow survivors in therapy. Her practice focuses on creating a safe environment where clients can heal from feeling defined by their traumatic experiences, allowing them to rediscover their authentic selves and build the lives they deserve.\n\nFollow Logan Cooper:\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@crookedcounselorcooper \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crookedcounselorcooper/\n\nTo inquire about counseling services, contact Logan at Logancoopercounseling@gmail.com. \n\nFollow Me, Lisa Phillips: \nWebsite: https://www.lisaphillips.la\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/iamlisaphillips/\nFNO Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/fromnowonpod/\nFNO TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fromnowonpod\nFNO Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/fromnowonpod\nFNO X: https://twitter.com/fromnowonpod\n\nFrom Now On is produced by LA PHILLIPS MEDIA.

      "description": "#ptsd #veteran #servicedog \n\nJust a heads up: This episode contains discussions of sexual assault, initmate partner violence, substance abuse and PTSD. Some may find it upsetting. We encourage you to take care of yourself.\n\nWhat happens when a survivor of military sexual assault is not only silenced but discarded by the very institution they gave an oath to? How do we respond when their stories of trauma, PTSD, and struggle for justice come to light?\n\nToday, we confront military sexual trauma and the devastating aftermath for those who speak out. Army veteran, author, and PTSD advocate Simone Swartz joins Lisa to share her journey from honor and ambition to betrayal. Simone reveals how the military\u2019s culture of misogyny and silence left her without a safe place to turn after being assaulted by a fellow soldier. Instead of receiving care, she was blamed, ostracized, and ultimately discharged\u2014her service and future erased in a single stamp.\n\nSimone and Lisa discuss the long-term impact of military sexual trauma: PTSD, addiction, and the struggle for basic dignity and healthcare. But Simone\u2019s story is also one of hope and transformation. She is dedicated to helping others understand that PTSD is treatable. Through therapy, community, and the unconditional support of her service dog, Simone learned to manage her symptoms and rebuild her life. She shares practical insights on recognizing PTSD, seeking help, and the importance of persistence in recovery. \n\nFor Simone, her service dog became a lifeline\u2014helping her manage panic, rebuild trust, and reclaim her life one step at a time. Her message to listeners is clear: no matter the trauma, healing is possible, and no one is beyond hope. PTSD can be managed, and survivors deserve support, respect, and the chance to thrive. She has written, soon to be published PTSD and What Helped Me, in hopes of bringing a consolidated resource for those dealing with PTSD.\n\nThis episode is a call to believe survivors, to demand accountability from the systems that fail them, and to recognize that recovery is possible\u2014even after the deepest betrayals. Simone\u2019s courage and advocacy remind us that with the right support, every survivor can find a path forward.\n\n\u201CFrom now on, PTSD is treatable and the sky\u0027s the limit.\u201D\n\nAbout Simone Swartz:\n\nSimone Swartz is an Army Veteran, mother of 3, author, public speaker, and leading PTSD expert on Service dogs and PTSD.  She is also a Military Sexual Trauma Survivor.  Her journey living with PTSD, intimate partner violence, sexual assault, and addiction has led her to share her story and ways to overcome trauma and live a fulfilled life.\n\nFollow Simone Swartz:\nWebsite: https://www.ptsdandwhathelpedme.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ptsdandwhathelpedme\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@ptsdandwhathelpedme  \nYouTube: @Ptsdandwhathelpedme \nGunner the Service Dog Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/servicedoginnewyork\n\nFollow Me, Lisa Phillips: \nWebsite: https://www.lisaphillips.la\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/iamlisaphillips/\nFNO Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/fromnowonpod/\nFNO TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fromnowonpod\nFNO Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/fromnowonpod\nFNO X: https://twitter.com/fromnowonpod\n\nFrom Now On is produced by LA PHILLIPS MEDIA.

      "description": "#trauma #cptsd #healing #ptsd #csa\n\nJust a heads up: This episode contains discussions of familial sexual assault, grooming, psychological abuse and physical abuse. Some may find it upsetting. We encourage you to take care of yourself.\n\nHow do we recognize the signs of childhood abuse\u2014especially when it\u2019s hidden behind a mask of love and trust? What can we do to educate and empower children, parents, and communities to break the silence before it\u2019s too late?\n\nIn this episode, Lisa welcomes Jessica Ella, Australia\u2019s leading women\u2019s trauma therapist and survivor, to share her powerful story and expertise. Jessica\u2019s childhood was marked by confusion, fear, and secrets\u2014her father, admired by outsiders as \u201CSuper Dad,\u201D was in reality her abuser. Like so many children, Jessica trusted her parent completely, making the betrayal and manipulation even more devastating. She describes how abuse cloaked in love creates unbearable confusion, self-blame, and a twisted sense of normalcy that can last for decades.\n\nTogether, Lisa and Jessica break down the subtle and not-so-subtle signs of childhood abuse: secrecy, fear, sudden changes in behavior, withdrawal, and the burden of \u201Cunhappy secrets\u201D that children are too scared to share. They discuss the importance of teaching children the difference between safe surprises and unsafe secrets, and why early, age-appropriate conversations are crucial for prevention. Jessica shares her experience writing the children\u2019s book Secret or Surprise\u2014a practical tool designed to help families and educators start these vital conversations with kids as young as four, before grooming and abuse can take root.\n\nThis episode is a call to action for parents, teachers, and caregivers: learn the signs, trust your instincts, and create safe spaces where children know they can speak up. Lisa and Jessica remind listeners that education, open dialogue, and breaking generational cycles of silence are the keys to protecting children and supporting survivors on their path to healing.\n\n\u201CFrom now on\u2026I will always be the example.\u201D\n\nAbout Jessica Ella:\nJessica Ella is an internationally accredited holistic trauma expert and the founder of Aaruka\u00AE Therapy. Known as Australia\u2019s Leading Women\u2019s Trauma Therapist, Jessica has helped thousands of women break free from their past, helping them to heal their complex trauma and sexual abuse so that they can reclaim freedom, love \u0026 power.

      "title": "THE SECRET RELATIONSHIP: Surviving Abuse When He Denies You Ever Existed",
      "description": "#covertabuse #domesticabuse #healing \n\nJust a heads up: This episode contains discussions of grooming, coercive control, and physical abuse. Some may find it upsetting. We encourage you to take care of yourself.\n\nWhat happens when the person who hurt you most insists you were never even together? When survivors come forward with stories of hidden relationships and abuse, they\u2019re often met with disbelief\u2014especially when the abuser\u2019s public persona is charming, generous, and above reproach.\n\nIn this episode, Lisa welcomes Davina Durgana, PhD, an award-winning human rights expert and survivor, who bravely shares her story of a secret relationship marked by manipulation, isolation, and escalating abuse. While her abuser maintained a blameless public image, behind closed doors, he was physically and emotionally abusive\u2014using secrecy, coercion, and violence to control every aspect of her life.\n\nDavina\u2019s story reveals how abusers weaponize secrecy, insisting on hidden relationships under the guise of \u201Cprotection,\u201D while privately inflicting harm and publicly denying any connection. When Davina finally broke her silence, her abuser not only denied their relationship and their child, but also launched a smear campaign\u2014using legal threats, false accusations, and manipulative tactics to discredit her and protect his reputation.\n\nLisa and Davina discuss the unique trauma of being erased and gaslit, the emotional toll of fighting for acknowledgment in a world that only sees the abuser\u2019s public mask, and the exhausting legal battles survivors face just to be heard. From seeking restraining orders to defending herself against defamation to seeking child support, Davina\u2019s journey exposes the deep flaws in a system that too often fails to recognize covert abuse and protect those most at risk.\n\nThis episode is a call for empathy, validation, and accountability. Survivors deserve to be seen, heard, and believed\u2014even when their abuser pretends they never existed and tries to destroy their credibility. Lisa and Davina challenge the culture of silence, urging listeners to stand with survivors and demand justice, both inside and outside the courtroom.\n\n\u201CFrom now on\u2026I will not tolerate behavior that I wouldn\u2019t want my daughter to tolerate.\u201D\n\n\nAbout Davina Durgana:\n\nDavina Durgana, PhD, is an award-winning international human rights statistician who has developed leading global models to assess risk and vulnerability to modern\nslavery. \n\nDr. Davina Durgana was a Founding Author of the Global Slavery Index and Contributing Founding Author of the UN\u2019s Global Estimates of Modern Slavery. \n\nShe is the Director of Free the Slaves, the oldest anti-trafficking organization in the United States and is currently working on a book on family court reform for domestic violence survivors and their children. \n\nFollow Davina Durgana:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/davinadurgana\n\nFollow Me, Lisa Phillips: \nWebsite: https://www.lisaphillips.la\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/iamlisaphillips/\nFNO Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/fromnowonpod/\nFNO TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fromnowonpod\nFNO Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/fromnowonpod\nFNO X: https://twitter.com/fromnowonpod\n\nFrom Now On is produced by LA PHILLIPS MEDIA.

      "description": "#survivor #coverup #listentosurvivors #trauma\n\nJust a heads up: This episode contains discussions of physical, emotional, psychological abuse and sexual assault. Some may find it upsetting. We encourage you to take care of yourself.\n\nWhat happens when the place meant to launch your future becomes the site of your worst nightmare\u2014and the very institution meant to protect you chooses to protect itself instead? In this episode, Lisa sits down with Iesha Campbell, whose first weeks at a North Carolina college ended in unimaginable horror: drugged and assaulted by 13 athletes at a party in a dorm room, a place she should have felt safe.\n\nBut the trauma didn\u2019t end with the crime. Despite a positive rape kit and clear evidence, Iesha was met with disbelief, intimidation, and victim-blaming by the university and campus police. Instead of support, she and her family were pressured to stay silent\u2014warned that pursuing justice would only bring shame and ruin to her reputation, while her attackers walked free. The university\u2019s priority was clear: protect its image and its athletes, no matter the cost to the survivor.\n\nIesha\u2019s story is not just about surviving a horrific assault, but about the lifelong consequences of institutional betrayal. She shares the enduring impact of the cover-up: PTSD, anxiety, depression, and the struggle to reclaim her sense of worth and safety in a world that failed to stand by her. Lisa and Iesha confront the staggering reality that one in five college women will be sexually assaulted, and most will never see justice\u2014not because they didn\u2019t come forward, but because those in power chose to look away.\n\nThis episode is a call to break the silence, demand accountability from universities, and support survivors with empathy\u2014not shame. Lisa and Aisha remind listeners that the true cost of a cover-up is measured in lives forever altered by trauma, and that speaking out is the first step toward change.\n\n\u201CFrom now on\u2026 I\u2019ll never abandon me.\u201D\n\nAbout Iesha Campbell:\nIesha Campebell is a resilient soul with a heart of gold.

      "description": "#coercivecontrol #groomingtactics #stalking \n\nJust a heads up: This episode contains discussions of intimate partner violence and coercive control, emotional, financial, and psychological abuse. Some may find it upsetting. We encourage you to take care of yourself.\n\nWhat happens when the fight for your life takes place outside the ring? In this episode, we expose the hidden world of abuse, coercive control, and grooming in athletics through the powerful story of Nikki Hru\u2014a female boxer whose coach became her abuser.\n\nNikki\u2019s journey reveals how power dynamics in sports can be exploited, turning mentorship into manipulation and training into emotional captivity. She bravely details how her coach groomed her, isolated her from support, and used his authority to control every aspect of her life, both in and out of the gym, under the guise of a relationship. This is not just a story about abuse in the boxing world\u2014it\u2019s a testament to the unique challenges female athletes face when the very system meant to empower them becomes a weapon for control.\n\nBut Nikki\u2019s fight didn\u2019t end when she broke free from her coach\u2019s grip. She faced a new battle in the legal system, navigating the daunting process of seeking a restraining order for her safety. Nikki shares the emotional toll of having to prove her abuse, the barriers survivors encounter in court, and the courage it takes to demand protection when institutions are slow to act.\nNikki\u2019s story is about breaking that silence, challenging the systems that enable abuse, and showing other female athletes that they are not alone.\n\nThis episode is a call to action: to recognize, believe, and support survivors in sports, to hold abusers and institutions accountable, and to empower women everywhere to reclaim their stories\u2014inside and outside the ring.\n\n\u201CFrom now on\u2026 I\u2019ll never abandon me.\u201D\n\nAbout Nikki Hru:\nNikki Hru is an actress and an influencer boxer, as well as a survivor of domestic abuse. Nikki is hoping that sharing at least part of her story will help other victims feel seen and empowered in their survival.

      "description": "#CSAM #familyabuse #Healingoutloud #survivor\n\nJust a heads up: This episode contains discussions of coercion, child sexual assault by a parent, intimate partner violence, and addiction recovery. Some may find it upsetting. We encourage you to take care of yourself.\n\nWhat does it mean to shatter the silence that has trapped generations? Today, we confront the hidden epidemic of child sexual abuse within the family and the generational trauma it leaves in its wake. Too many children are forced to carry secrets, confusion, and shame\u2014believing they are the problem, when the truth is, the shame never belonged to them.\n\nLisa welcomes Tiffany Smith, motivational speaker, author, wellness coach, DPS Officer with Nevada State Police: Division of Parole \u0026 Probation and survivor of childhood sexual abuse, domestic violence, and narcissistic abuse. At just 13 years old, Tiffany found the courage to stand up to her abuser\u2014her own father\u2014and declare that the cycle would end with her. She became the protector for her younger sisters, carrying a burden no child should bear, and navigated a home where silence and survival were the only options.\n\nTogether, Lisa and Tiffany explore the lifelong impact of trauma, the complexity of family loyalty, and the courage it takes to finally speak the truth after decades of silence. Tiffany shares how she broke free from the legacy of abuse, faced the pain of disclosure as an adult, and began the journey of healing\u2014not just for herself, but for future generations. Her story is one of fierce resilience, transformation, and the power of becoming the hero she needed as a child.\n\nThis episode is a call to break the silence, end the stigma, and support survivors with empathy and understanding. Lisa and Tiffany remind us that healing is not linear, but every act of truth-telling is a step toward reclaiming power, rewriting the narrative, and breaking generational cycles for good.\n\n\nFollow Tiffany Smith :\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thetiffanysmith\nBook Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/girlgetup_2025\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thetiffanysmith\n\nFollow Me, Lisa Phillips: \nWebsite: https://www.lisaphillips.la\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/iamlisaphillips/\nFNO Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/fromnowonpod/\nFNO TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fromnowonpod\nFNO Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/fromnowonpod\nFNO X: https://twitter.com/fromnowonpod\n\nFrom Now On is produced by LA PHILLIPS MEDIA.

      "description": "#healing #transformation #purpose \n\nJust a heads up: This episode contains discussions of healing after trauma. Some may find it upsetting. We encourage you to take care of yourself.\n\nToday, we\u2019re exploring the powerful connection between mindset, healing, and purpose. Too often, survivors are told to \u201Cmove on\u201D or \u201Cjust be positive,\u201D but real transformation requires more than empty platitudes; it demands courage, self-reflection, and a willingness to rewrite your story.\n\nLisa welcomes Lewis Huckstep, a purpose and transformation coach who has turned his own history of childhood trauma into a mission to help others reclaim their worth and step into the lives they were meant to live. Lewis shares how his deepest wounds became the seeds of his purpose, and how embracing vulnerability, setting boundaries, and healing old patterns allowed him to create a life of inspiration and service to others.\n\nTogether, Lisa and Lewis break down the myth that trauma defines you and discuss practical steps for transforming emotional triggers, breaking free from toxic cycles, and discovering your authentic self. They explore why purpose often emerges from our greatest pain, and how giving back can be the ultimate act of healing.\n\nThis episode is a call to action for anyone ready to move beyond survival and step into a life of meaning. Lisa and Lewis invite you to see your story not as a source of shame, but as the foundation for your greatest gift to the world. Healing isn\u2019t about forgetting the past. It\u2019s about using it to fuel your future.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered how to turn adversity into inspiration or how to find purpose on the other side of pain, this conversation is for you.\n\nAbout Lewis Huckstep:\nLewis Huckstep is a Purpose \u0026 Transformation Coach, author of The Inspired Life Method, a speaker, and podcast host of The Lewis Huckstep Experience. Lewis Huckstep discovers people\u2019s life\u0027s purpose and their true, authentic self.

      "description": "We step into the martial arts world, a space built on honor and discipline, yet often hiding a darker reality of manipulation and exploitation. Lisa welcomes Elicia Ybarra, a lifelong martial artist and dedicated women\u2019s self-defense instructor, who transformed her own experience of abuse within the industry into a mission to uplift others. Elicia shares how martial arts became her escape from a chaotic, abusive childhood, only to later confront betrayal and harm by those in positions of power. Together, Lisa and Elicia expose how the martial arts community\u2019s strict hierarchies and culture of silence protect abusers and isolate survivors, leaving many trapped in cycles of shame and disbelief. This episode is about more than exposing a broken system; it\u2019s about reclaiming martial arts as a tool for true empowerment. Elicia\u2019s story is one of resilience, teaching that real self-defense starts with permission: to trust your instincts, set boundaries, and speak out. Lisa and Elicia call for a new vision of martial arts, one that builds women up, not breaks them down, and urge listeners to support survivors with empathy and action, not judgment or blame. If you\u2019ve ever wondered how to turn survival into strength or how to make martial arts a place of real empowerment, this conversation is for you. About Elicia Ybarra: Elicia is a lifelong martial artist with over two decades of martial arts experience, including a 4th dan black belt in Taekwondo and a 1st dan black belt in Hapkido. As the founder of Pretty Hands, Hard Punches, Elicia uses her own experiences overcoming abuse and exploitation within the martial arts industry to teach women practical self-defense techniques, boundary-setting, and how to recognize and stand against abuse. Her unique approach combines technical skill, emotional intelligence, and empowerment to help women build physical and mental strength.

We encourage you to take care of yourself.\n\nWhat happens when the person you love and trust with your dreams turns out to be a master manipulator? How do you escape when your abuser is not only charming and powerful, but also an award-winning reality tv producer who knows how to shape narratives both on and off the screen?\n\nIn this episode, Lisa Phillips welcomes Jane Doe, a devoted mother and accomplished professional, who bravely shares her harrowing journey through the labyrinth of coercive control. Jane reveals how her abuser, a celebrated producer with accolades and industry connections, used his expertise in storytelling, image management, and influence to isolate her, erode her self-worth, and ultimately weaponize the legal system against her.\n\nJane\u2019s story exposes the chilling reality of psychological abuse that leaves no visible scars but inflicts deep wounds. She recounts how her partner\u2019s charm quickly turned to control: love-bombing, social isolation, financial dependence, and relentless gaslighting. But the abuse didn\u2019t end at home. When Jane tried to break free, her ex leveraged his resources and reputation to manipulate the courts, painting her as unstable and unfit, and orchestrating a campaign that ultimately separated her from her children.\n\nLisa and Jane discuss the urgent need for legal reforms to recognize coercive control as a form of domestic violence, and the devastating impact when abusers exploit their power and the justice system to continue their reign of control. Jane\u2019s resilience and determination to end the cycle of trauma for her family are a testament to the strength of survivors everywhere.\n\nThis episode is a call to action: to support survivors, challenge the systems that enable abusers, and demand accountability, no matter how powerful the perpetrator.\n\n\u201CFrom now on\u2026we are the light, the beacon of warmth, of clarity, to help anyone to navigate this battlefield.\u201D\u00A0\n\n\nAbout Jane Doe:\n\nJane Doe is, foremost, a devoted mother committed to ending intergenerational trauma in her family. She is also an award-winning academic, athlete, and artist with a passion for outdoor adventure, meditation, and prayer.\u00A0 A Digital Producer and Designer by professional trade. A recovering codependent and domestic violence survivor. Her recent experience within the criminal and legal system have been a rollercoaster of disappointment and victory.

She also discusses the red flags she had missed, such as the violent language and anger directed toward other drivers, which are indicators of a potentially abusive personality.\n\nThis episode isn\u0027t just about Taylor\u0027s survival; it\u0027s a crucial discussion about postpartum abuse and the ways abusers exploit the unique vulnerabilities of new mothers. It\u0027s a vital resource for anyone who suspects something is wrong in their relationship, or who wants to support loved ones navigating the challenges of new parenthood. It also highlights the power of community \u2013 Taylor\u2019s family and friends rallied alongside her to help her create a safe and loving home for her and her kids.\n\n\u201CFrom now on\u2026I am going to put myself and my children first, and I\u0027m gonna love correctly, and I\u0027m going to be loved correctly.\u201D\n\nAbout Taylor Windmon\n\nTaylor is a passionate advocate for breaking the cycle of domestic violence.

      "description": "#sextrafficking #grooming #listentosurvivors\n\nJust a heads up: This episode contains discussions of childhood sexual abuse and sex trafficking. Some may find it upsetting. We encourage you to take care of yourself.\n\nWhat happens when the person you trust most\u2014your own mother\u2014becomes the architect of unimaginable harm? Today, we delve into the harrowing story of Cindy L\u00EA, a survivor of familial sex trafficking who, starting at 8 years old, endured years of abuse facilitated by her own mother.\n\nCindy shares her journey of survival, beginning with her family\u0027s financial struggles that led her mother to make a devastating \u0022deal\u0022 with a neighbor across the street. Cindy recounts how her mother essentially traded her to this predator, who masked his exploitation as love and trust. For years, Cindy was groomed and sexually assaulted while her mother turned a blind eye in exchange for money. When Cindy did tell her siblings the police got involved. Yet her mother actively encouraged her to \u201Clet it go\u201D and not pursue prosecution. Her story sheds light on the systemic failures and personal betrayals that allowed this abuse to persist.\n\nLisa welcomed Cindy to discuss not only her survival but her path to healing and the complex emotions she grapples with, including her feelings toward her mother. Together, they confront the dark realities of grooming, the devastating impact of a parent\u2019s choices, and the cultural silence surrounding abuse. Cindy\u2019s resilience is a testament to the human spirit, and her advocacy aims to help others find their way out of dark times to prevent the heartache she once endured. \n\nThis episode is a call to action: to break the silence, support survivors, and ensure no child has to endure what Cindy did. It\u2019s about exposing predators hiding in plain sight and empowering survivors to reclaim their stories.\n\nAbout Cindy L\u00EA\n\nCindy L\u00EA is a thriving business owner, a loving wife, a caring friend, and a devoted mother. Cindy\u2019s journey does not end with her survival. She has taken it upon herself to shine a light on the dark reality of familial sex trafficking, a subject that is often surrounded by silence. \n\nFollow Cindy L\u00EA:\nWebsite: https://www.beautybymrscindy.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ms_cindyle/\n\nFollow Me, Lisa Phillips: \nWebsite: https://www.lisaphillips.la\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/iamlisaphillips/\nFNO Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/fromnowonpod/\nFNO TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fromnowonpod\nFNO Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/fromnowonpod\nFNO X: https://twitter.com/fromnowonpod\n\nFrom Now On is produced by LA PHILLIPS MEDIA.

      "description": "#protectmyimage #digitaltrafficking #grooming \n\nJust a heads up: This episode contains discussions of child sexual abuse, nonconsensual distribution of child sexual abuse materials, grooming, and eating disorders due to PTSD. Some may find it upsetting. We encourage you to take care of yourself. \n\nWhere are the safe spaces for young gay teens to connect when community is non-existent at school? Why not the internet? Why not a dating app?\n\nToday, we\u2019re highlighting the fact that predators search for minors on dating apps to exploit, coerce, and groom, especially in the gay community. These teens are often blackmailed to remain silent and live these secret lives of pain. The systems that are supposed to protect often don\u2019t take these predators seriously or sweep this exploitation under the rug. In the end, the survivor is further harmed and silenced.\n\nLisa welcomes Albert Flores a survivor, advocate, and storyteller passionate about creating safer spaces for vulnerable communities. Albert shares how they joined a dating app geared toward the LGBTQ community at 14 in the hopes of connecting with other local gay teens. Unfortunately, he found that local adult men sought him out instead. He was groomed by multiple men, even the older brother of a famous influencer family that created content geared toward children.\n\nWhen incidents of exploitation were made public, Albert\u2019s school administration, local police force, friends, and even the app safety protocols woefully mishandled these situations. Albert has been on a journey processing the effects of their trauma and PTSD. Now, Albert uses his voice to raise awareness about online safety, survivor support, and mental health.\nWhat happened to Albert should have never been possible. We\u2019re grateful for their courage to tell their story.\n\nThis episode is all about education, prevention, and a call to action to hold these institutions and companies accountable so that teens can connect safely on the internet. \n\nFrom now on, we will speak up for ourselves and say no. \n\nFollow Albert Flores:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/albertflrz/\n\nFollow Me, Lisa Phillips: \nWebsite: https://www.lisaphillips.la\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/iamlisaphillips/\nFNO Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/fromnowonpod/\nFNO TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fromnowonpod\nFNO Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/fromnowonpod\nFNO X: https://twitter.com/fromnowonpod\n\nFrom Now On is produced by LA PHILLIPS MEDIA.

We encourage you to take care of yourself.\n\nWhat happens when someone claiming to be part of your community isn\u2019t who they say they are? When they use culture as a mask, trust as a weapon, and deception as a means of control?\n\nToday, we\u2019re confronting the historical cycle of submission, manipulation, and control\u2014a cycle that predators exploit to their advantage. For generations, Indigenous communities have endured forced assimilation, systemic oppression, and silencing, conditioning many to submit to authority, to ignore red flags, and to stay silent in the face of abuse. But what happens when someone who claims to be a part of your community turns out to be a fraud?\n\nLisa welcomes Chiffon Lark, an artist, advocate, and Indigenous woman who survived a calculated campaign of deception, coercion, and emotional abuse. What started as a promising connection quickly unraveled into something far more sinister. Chiffon was targeted by a man who fabricated his identity, infiltrated her community, and used trust as a weapon. From love bombing to gaslighting to financial control, his manipulation was relentless\u2014but so was Chiffon\u2019s resilience.\n\nThis episode is about breaking free from cycles of submission, reclaiming power, and exposing imposters who hide behind culture, trust, and false promises.\n\nFrom now on\u2026 \u201CI will execute my right to honor myself first so that I can honor my community.\u201D\n\nAbout Chiffon Lark\n\nChiffon Lark (b.1989) is a full time Artist/Illustrator in San Diego, CA.

      "description": "#narcissisticabuse #traumabond #toxicrelationship\n\nJust a heads up: This episode contains discussions of intimate partner violence, predatory behavior, and coercive control. Some may find it upsetting. We encourage you to take care of yourself.\n\nWhy is it so hard to leave an abusive relationship? Why do survivors stay, even when the red flags are undeniable? The answer lies in one of the most powerful psychological traps\u2014the trauma bond.\n\nToday, we\u2019re diving deep into the dark triad\u2014narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy\u2014and how these personality traits drive manipulation, gaslighting, and coercive control. Abusers don\u2019t just use physical violence; they weaponize charm, isolation, and intermittent reinforcement to keep victims emotionally tethered. And they don\u2019t act alone\u2014there\u2019s an entire system of enablers ensuring their power remains intact.\n\nLisa welcomes Dr. Nadine Macaluso, former model, therapist, and author of Run Like Hell: A Therapist\u2019s Guide to Recognizing, Escaping, and Healing from Trauma Bonds. Known to many as \u201CDr. Nae,\u201D she is the real-life inspiration behind Naomi Belfort\u2019s character in The Wolf of Wall Street. After surviving an eight-year marriage to Jordan Belfort, marked by abuse, greed, and trauma, Dr. Nae turned her trauma into a mission\u2014educating others on how to break free from toxic cycles and reclaim their power.\n\nIn this episode, Lisa and Dr. Nae uncover the warning signs of trauma bonds, the psychological tricks abusers use to maintain control, and how survivors can break free. Survivors deserve more than just an escape\u2014they deserve healing, empowerment, and the ability to write a new story on their own terms.\n\nThis episode is about understanding, empowerment, and reclaiming your life.\nFrom Now On\u2026 don\u0027t self abandon, don\u0027t self sacrifice in the name of love.\n\nAbout Dr. Nadine Macaluso: \nHer journey of trauma and healing inspired her to return to school at age 39, where she earned her Master\u0027s in counseling and a Ph.D. in somatic psychotherapy. She further specialized with a two-year postdoctoral training in the Neuro-affective Relational Model (NARM).\n\nAs a therapist, Dr. Macaluso combines her education and personal experiences to help others heal from trauma. Her practice focuses on assisting patients in connecting with their authentic selves, fostering confidence, resilience, and agency. Dr. Macaluso firmly believes in the potential for post-traumatic growth, instilling hope in her patients and guiding them to reach their potential in life and love.\n\nFollow Dr. Nadine Macaluso:\nWebsite: https://drnae.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/therealdrnadine/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drnaelmft\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drnaelmft\nX: https://x.com/therealdrnadine\nYouTube:  @TheRealDrNadine  \n\nFollow Me, Lisa Phillips: \nWebsite: https://www.lisaphillips.la\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/iamlisaphillips/\nFNO Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/fromnowonpod/\nFNO TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fromnowonpod\nFNO Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/fromnowonpod\nFNO X: https://twitter.com/fromnowonpod\n\nFrom Now On is produced by LA PHILLIPS MEDIA.

We encourage you to take care of yourself.\n\nWhat happens when someone dares to expose the truth about an industry built on power, secrecy, and exploitation? How deep does the corruption go when trafficking, hip hop, and the Vegas elite collide?\n\nToday, we\u2019re pulling back the curtain on the dark underbelly of the entertainment world\u2014where money, influence, and exploitation intersect. Sex trafficking isn\u2019t just happening in the shadows; it thrives in high-end hotels, VIP suites, and behind the flashing lights of Las Vegas.

What if a friendly conversation turned into manipulation, blackmail, and a nightmare you couldn\u2019t escape?\n\nToday, we\u2019re exposing the terrifying reality of online predators\u2014how they groom, deceive, and exploit children in the digital age. Digital human trafficking and sextortion don\u2019t always start with violence; they often begin with trust.

Summer courageously shares her story to shine a light on the hidden epidemic of online child exploitation and to empower young people and parents to recognize the warning signs before it\u2019s too late.\n\nThis episode is about breaking the silence, demanding accountability, and taking back power from those who prey on the most vulnerable. \n\nFrom Now On\u2026 we will not wish bad things upon ourselves. \n\nFollow Summer Beach @summerbeachglobal236.1 and @summerathebeach_xo on Instagram and @summerathebeach_xo on TikTok.

Some may find it upsetting. We encourage you to take care of yourself.\n\nWhat happens when a survivor, still searching for love and normalcy, re-enters the same dating app that led to her trauma?\n\nIn part two of our conversation, Lisa continues speaking with Jane Doe, an artist, tech professional, and survivor, as she shares what happened when she returned to the dating app many months after her assault\u2014only to be matched with another predator.  What began as an attempt to reclaim her autonomy quickly turned into a chilling realization: predators and traffickers use dating apps as a hunting ground, and the platform\u2019s algorithm may have led her straight into another dangerous encounter.\n\nThe professor from an elite school, with connections to many powerful and wealthy people, love-bombed her differently than her first match. Their relationship quickly escalated to her traveling many hours to an island. There, she was controlled \u2013 locked in a room, told when to eat, how to dress, when she could go outside, who she could work for, and more. \n\nAs time went on, threats to her safety became more apparent, and she escaped that relationship only to be met with professional stalking and intimidation. With the help of a trafficking resource center and family. Jane was able to relocate to an unknown location for her safety. Her life is forever changed by this abuse.\n\nJane came on From Now On to educate others on the intersection of tech \u002B exploitation through her own experiences. She wants to educate others on the complexities of sexual assault and human trafficking so that her own experiences can be utilized for good to help end exploitation, specifically as it relates to power imbalances and predatory playbooks. She believes if we collectively unpack and examine these playbooks, and step away from the associated shame that wasn\u0027t ours to begin with, we can start to see they mostly utilize the same tactics.Healing isn\u0027t a linear journey so she uses her good days to help others impacted by harm.\n\nFrom Now On\u2026she\u2019s not going to hide.\n\nThank you, Jane Doe.

      "description": "What does it take to reclaim your body and rewrite your story when society labels you as broken? How do you confront shame head-on and emerge stronger than ever? Today, we\u2019re tackling the deep connection between shame, stigma, and self-worth. In this episode, Lisa welcomes Ally Hensley, author of Vagina Uncensored: A Memoir of Missing Parts . Diagnosed as a teenager with a rare medical condition, Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00FCster-Hauser Syndrome (MRKH), which changed her life forever, Ally faced decades of shame, self-blame, and disconnection from her body. But through her journey of creating her vagina and confronting her trauma, she found resilience, purpose, and a voice that refuses to be silenced. Ally and Lisa dive deep into the power of confronting stigma and societal censorship around topics like abuse, body image, and sexual health. Together, they explore how storytelling and radical honesty can transform pain into strength, breaking the cycle of shame and empowering others to embrace their truths. This episode is all about transformation\u2014healing from within, reclaiming your power, and redefining what it means to live authentically.

      "description": "What does it mean to be in and escape a \u201Ccult of one\u201D? How can we change the conversation around narcissistic abuse to support survivors and break the cycle of harm? In this episode, Lisa welcomes Vanessa Reiser, a therapist, survivor, and author of Narcissistic Abuse: A Therapist\u2019s Guide to Identifying, Escaping, and Healing from Toxic and Manipulative People. Together, they confront the devastating realities of narcissistic abuse, detail the Tell a Therapist\u2019s Hierarchy of Restoration and the steps survivors need to take when trying to break free. Vanessa shares her groundbreaking insights on the parallels between narcissistic relationships and cult dynamics, unveiling how narcissists use tactics like love bombing, future faking, mirroring, triangulation, and isolation to manipulate their prey. Lisa and Vanessa discuss the narcissist playbook and how they use many forms of punishment to control their \u201Ccult of one.\u201D Through Vanessa\u2019s book and personal journey, she emphasizes the importance of recognizing abuse, reclaiming autonomy, and building a support system to foster healing. This episode is a powerful call to action, challenging the narratives that glorify toxic relationships, naming abuse, stopping an ecosystem of chaos, and cultivating a life of radical self-love. Survivors deserve more than survival\u2014they deserve autonomy, joy, and respect. From now on\u2026 I will sit in truth.

SURVIVOR MADE follows a group of survivors as they defy the odds - building their own thriving businesses in Los Angeles, lobbying for change in Washington DC, and fighting to prove that investing in survivors saves lives.\n\nThis episode delves into the documentary\u2019s mission to redefine how society views survivors\u2014not as victims bound by their trauma but as creators, innovators, and leaders who are rebuilding their lives with strength and purpose.\n\nLisa and Sonya explore how SURVIVOR MADE challenges media stereotypes by focusing on healing, joy, and community rather than trauma. They discuss the powerful message that financial independence and community support are the cornerstones of lasting freedom for survivors. By shifting the narrative, SURVIVOR MADE  inspires hope and empowers viewers to see survivors in a new light\u2014as agents of change and contributors to a brighter future for us all.\n\nFrom now on\u2026 I will not question my potential.\n\nFollow SURVIVOR MADE: \nWebsite: https://survivormadedoc.com/\nGifted by FreeFrom: https://giftedbyfreefrom.org/\nFreeFrom Website: https://www.freefrom.org/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/survivormadedocumentary/\n\nSonya Passi is the Founder \u0026 CEO of FreeFrom, a national organization transforming our society\u2019s response to gender-based violence so that survivors and their families can thrive.

This relationship is one of the reasons why From Now On exists. He was a copycat, and Lisa was his prey.\n\nLisa welcomes Kate Ranta, a survivor of intimate partner and gun violence. In 2012, after leaving her abusive marriage, her ex-husband stalked Kate to her apartment, where he shot her and her father in front of their 4-year-old son \u2013 miraculously, everyone survived the attack. \n\nIn this episode, Lisa and Kate unpack the layers of abuse Kate experienced with her ex.

      "description": "#nda #speakup #EndNDAmisuse\n\nJust a heads up: This episode contains discussions of sexual assault and suicidal ideation. Some may find it upsetting. We encourage you to take care of yourself.\n\nHow do survivors receive justice? What happens when survivors are influenced to sign an NDA? Today, we\u2019re going to dive deep into the world of NDAs and how NDAs are another form of abuse.\n\nLisa welcomes Zelda Perkins, Co-Founder of the Can\u2019t Buy My Silence campaign. Zelda shares her experience of signing an NDA and breaking the NDA. She educates on how NDAs are predatory and abusive to survivors, why they are so prevalent in SA cases, and how they are ultimately not legally enforceable. \n\nThis episode is all about how your voice, your survivor story is more powerful and important than any lump sum for your silence. We encourage you to educate yourself more about NDAs before you sign them.\nFrom now on, always question\u2026 don\u2019t be afraid to question. Don\u2019t believe everything a lawyer tells you. \n\n\nZelda Perkins was the first woman to break an NDA in 2017, signed decades earlier, with Harvey Weinstein. She brought the systematic abuse of NDA\u2019s to the attention of the British Government and international press, giving evidence at two parliamentary inquiries, which uncovered an epidemic of misuse, and pushed the Solicitors Regulatory Authority to take disciplinary action against the lawyer who created the NDA for Weinstein. Her actions have been inspiring others to come forward by her example. She has been campaigning for legislative and regulatory reform in the UK since 2017 and launched the Global campaign Can\u2019t Buy My Silence cantbuymysilence.com with Canadian Co Founder, Professor Julie Macfarlane in September 2021. They are working with Government in the UK, the Republic of Ireland, Canada and Australia to change legislation and regulation around the misuse of NDA\u2019s. They have had legislative success in the UK, Ireland and Canada with the first laws of their kind banning NDAs being passed in all three countries, however there is still a long way to go. Zelda was named a Person of the Year by Time magazine in 2018,  by the Guardian in 2020 and in 2023 awarded for her Outstanding Contribution to Gender Equality by UN Women UK. Her character was portrayed by Samantha Morton in the Universal Pictures feature \u201CShe Said\u201D documenting her part in the downfall of Weinstein. \n\nFollow Zelda Perkins:\nWebsite: https://www.cantbuymysilence.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/cbmsilenceuk/\nX (Formerly Twitter): https://twitter.com/cbmsilence\n\nFollow Me, Lisa Phillips: \nWebsite: https://www.lisaphillips.la\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/iamlisaphillips/\nFNO Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/fromnowonpod/\nFNO TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fromnowonpod\nFNO Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/fromnowonpod\nFNO X: https://twitter.com/fromnowonpod\n\nFrom Now On is produced by LA PHILLIPS MEDIA.

      "description": "Just a heads up: This episode contains discussions of sexual assault and trafficking. Some may find it upsetting. We encourage you to take care of yourself.\n\nWhere does grief fit into the conversation around abuse and survival? Today, we\u2019re going to unpack how compounded trauma and grief can get us stuck in a cycle of suffering. This type of suffering is what serial predators look for as they seek out their next victim. But grief is also a tool to help process trauma. It is a tool in survivors healing. \n\nOn this episode, Lisa welcomes Victoria Valentino. Victoria is a retired hospice nurse,  Playboy\u2019s Miss September 1963, author, speaker, activist, and a multi-rape, child and domestic abuse and sex trafficking survivor. Since 2014, when she went public about being a Bill Cosby survivor, she has been working to educate about rape culture, lobbying to change laws that give the power back to survivors to seek justice against their perpetrators.\n\nVictoria walks Lisa through the life events that made her a target for Cosby and the long-windy road of her healing journey. She shares her experiences with grief, the psychology of trauma, and her expressions of survival through her art. She recently directed  \u201CSHEro: A Tribute to the Sister Survivors of Bill Cosby \u0026 to All Survivors of Sexual Violence,\u201D  a play she wrote that premiered on July 21, 2024. She also authored Dirty Diamonds: The Repurposed Life of a Playboy Icon and Cosby Survivor.\n\nThis episode is all about how it\u2019s never too late to tell your story, process your trauma, fight for justice, and express your healing in art. We are so grateful to Victoria for her honesty and vulnerability. \n\nFrom now on, I want peace. \n\nFollow Victoria Valentino:\nWebsite: https://www.victoriavalentino.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/victoriavalentino1/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/victoria.valentino1\n\nFollow Me, Lisa Phillips: \nWebsite: https://www.lisaphillips.la\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/iamlisaphillips/\nFNO Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/fromnowonpod/\nFNO TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fromnowonpod\nFNO Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/fromnowonpod\nFNO X: https://twitter.com/fromnowonpod\n\nFrom Now On is produced by LA PHILLIPS MEDIA.

We encourage you to take care of yourself.\n\nSerial predators always have a pattern. They practice and refine their manipulative tactics so that when they approach a new target, their abuse isn\u2019t noticed or at least not actively questioned. It isn\u2019t until years later that the realization that one has been abused comes to the surface. It\u2019s often because a brave survivor decided to go public about the abuse. \n\nToday, Lisa welcomes Olympic Gold Medalist and current head coach of the Arkansas Razorbacks gymnastics team, Jordyn Wieber. Jordyn is also a survivor of Larry Nassar. Lisa and Jordyn discuss her journey in elite gymnastics all the way to the Olympics. Jordyn also shares how she came to testify at Larry Nassar\u2019s sentencing hearing and how, since then, she has been an active advocate for survivors, holding systems account|able who enabled their abuser. Jordyn details Larry\u2019s M.O. and the red flags she came to understand as she processed her trauma.  \n\nJordyn gave us an update on her healing journey and the role coaching has played in that journey. We are grateful for Jordyn\u2019s willingness to share her story and her candor.\n\nThis episode is all about acknowledging there is power behind survivors speaking out and how these voices can hold systems accountable for enabling and protecting abusers.\n\nFrom now on, I will ALWAYS use my voice.\n\nFollow Jordyn Wieber:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordyn_wieber/\nX: https://twitter.com/jordyn_wieber\n\nFollow Me, Lisa Phillips: \nWebsite: https://www.lisaphillips.la\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/iamlisaphillips/\nFNO Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/fromnowonpod/\nFNO TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fromnowonpod\nFNO Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/fromnowonpod\nFNO X: https://twitter.com/fromnowonpod\n\nFrom Now On is produced by LA PHILLIPS MEDIA.

Last episode, our guest Ariel Lyndsey shared how she was SA\u2019ed at an audition by two men. This past June, she posted about it on Instagram and now there is a survivor sisters group chat \u2013 where they all share similar experiences that span over 10 years.\n\nToday, Lisa welcomes sisters, Aubrey and Amber, who are in the survivor sisters group chat with Ariel. They tell the story of why they have left the entertainment industry and how a social media post calling out their abuser made them realize they aren\u2019t alone. Today, they are reclaiming their power by sharing their own stories. \nWe are humbled and honored to hold this space for them to share their stories.\nThis episode is all about how serial predators are calculated with their grooming tactics. They create a cycle of hope and disappointment, trust and betrayal. This episode is also about the power of telling your story. It will change lives.

We encourage listeners to prepare themselves.\n\nThere is a dark side to Hollywood and the entertainment industry. The ecosystems within the entertainment industry are breeding grounds for predators. Power dynamics are constantly in play as artists work to follow their dreams. Predators love to be the gatekeepers, but Lisa is working to expose these abusive tactics to create change and safety for those who are following their dreams.\n\nToday, Lisa welcomes multi-hyphenated artist Ariel Lyndsey to the podcast. Ariel went viral when she was publicly assaulted while on a girl\u0027s trip to Vegas. Her friend just so happened to capture the aftermath of the event and her efforts to have authorities take the assault seriously. Ariel and Lisa discuss how this public event triggered a traumatic experience that happened years earlier at an audition.\n\nThey chat about how unregulated industries allow for predators to be repeat offenders, the importance of sharing your survivor story, ways to navigate trolls, and the journey to hold predators accountable.\n\nThis episode is all about the highs and lows of sharing your story but, ultimately, how liberating it is to share your truth and reclaim your agency after abuse. \n\nFrom now on we share our unfiltered truth.\n\nFollow Ariel Lyndsey:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ariellyndsey/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@ariellyndsey\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/ariellyndsey\nYouTube:   @ArielLyndsey  \n\nFollow Me, Lisa Phillips: \nWebsite: https://www.lisaphillips.la\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/iamlisaphillips/\nFNO Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/fromnowonpod/\nFNO TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fromnowonpod\nFNO Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/fromnowonpod\nFNO X: https://twitter.com/fromnowonpod\n\nFrom Now On is produced by LA PHILLIPS MEDIA.
