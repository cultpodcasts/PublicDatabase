      "description": "Today we\u0027re going to take the first of many stabs at the wonderfully awkward world of post-cult dating. Essentially, the challenge of learning things most people learned in high school at the age of 35.\u00A0\n Here\u0027s the thing, you can\u0027t skip the mess. The mess builds the muscles. But we\u0027ve put together some of the most common lessons learned for all you late bloomers that will hopefully make the leveling up process just a little bit easier.\u00A0\n In this episode, we\u0027ll be starting, as usual, with the mess left to us by the cult, then moving on to the shame of feeling inexperienced, the most common pitfalls we\u0027ll likely fall into, and why it might be a good idea to fall into them anyway",

There\u0027s a pattern here, and we spend this entire episode exploring that pattern in more detail, not only in how it presents in those on this spectrum, but also in the way the same characteristics can be seen in the organization itself, as a narcissistic entity.",

      "description": "There was a time in my life when I rolled my eyes at the idea of therapy. It seemed ridiculous that simply talking with someone could ever lead to any kind of real change or improvement to my life experience. I\u0027m delighted to report that I was very, very wrong about that assessment. Today\u0027s episode is a bit of love letter to therapy. We talk about what is therapy, what it is not, how it can be helpful, what good therapy looks like vs bad therapy, and how to go about finding the right therapist (or counselor, or coach) for you. If you\u0027ve ever wondered what all the fuss is about, this episode is for you",
