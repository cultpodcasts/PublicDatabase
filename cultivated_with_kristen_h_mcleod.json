      "title": "Dress Code for the Afterlife",
      "description": "The 2x2s took modesty seriously\u2014weaponized it, really. So naturally, denim was suspect. Unwritten dress codes were less about hiding skin than functioning as a system to keep us in line. Our sedate skirts and dresses served as uniforms for an invisible battle and served as declarations of our compliance. The 2x2s didn\u2019t write the rules down. They didn\u2019t have to. Because everyone already knew them. My father joined the 2x2 cult when I was a child. They called themselves true Christians. No, that\u2019s not quite right, they didn\u2019t like that label, although I\u2019ve seen the odd business card indicating that the name we didn\u2019t have was\u2014in fact\u2014Christian Fellowship. The cult was less religion, more a dress code with severe afterlife implications. Women wore long skirts and long hair. Men were mostly left alone, which seemed doctrinally inconsistent given the beard situation with Jesus. No jeans. No makeup. No jewelry. No bare shoulders. Nothing fitted, nothing bright. Nothing that might suggest you\u2019d chosen your outfit purposely or thought you looked good. Modesty wasn\u2019t about covering up. It was about erasing. I didn\u2019t believe. Or, I didn\u2019t believe easily. I wanted to. I wanted to want to. I hoped that counted. So I obeyed. I wore knee covering skirts, one swishy and flower patterned and with 57 buttons that\u2014if I hadn\u2019t been forced to wear it, I\u2019d have loved. It was a confusing flicker of personal taste amid obligation. I covered my shoulders and my new and alarmingly full breasts that, from comments and stares, drew attention. I hated how I looked even more than the baseline of self-hate assigned to all pre- and fully-fledged teens, which meant I was doing it right. The worse you felt, the closer you were to God. That was the theology\u2014unspoken, airtight, and deeply unflattering.One spring, I wore a faded denim number to Meeting. Nineties-long and light-washed. (The redo has been on the racks at Aritzia for a couple years now and I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but I bought one. Maybe someday I\u2019ll ceremoniously burn it, because I haven\u2019t been able to bring myself to wear it.) Listen. I knew that fabric for a Meeting was risky. Only the rebels wore denim and everyone knew they were fast tracking to hell. But Wednesday night Bible Study was\u2014in theory\u2014more relaxed than the Sunday meetings. I\u2019d crunched the fashion math, though, and determined the skirt\u2019s length cancelled its fabric. Turns out I was just as bad at fashion math as regular math. The Elder scanned the room as he closed with his Testimony. \u201CSometimes the Enemy disguises comfort as righteousness. The path is narrow, and we must take care we\u2019re not led astray.\u0022 On that last beat, he looked directly at me. That\u2019s how correction worked\u2014never explicitly addressed, never direct. It came in riddles, in warnings, and through carefully calibrated glances. Unless that correction came in the form of a Worker who convinces your high school principal he\u2019s your minister\u2014so it\u2019s cool beans if he takes you out for lunch a few times and then ends up in your bedroom so you can talk privately. But those stories are for another day. They belong to a different rage. I went to Convention one summer dressed for salvation and\u2014let\u2019s be honest, in hopes I presented well enough at what was, essentially, an approved venue for finding your mate.I had learned by then not to save my best outfit for Sunday. Technically, Sunday was the most important day, but Convention ended after the second setting of lunch had been served in the Dining Shed. Saturday was better suited for showing off, but truly, Friday made the most sense. That way, the impact of people\u2019s shock and awe on seeing my beautiful outfit wouldn\u2019t be wasted by leaving the next day. I yearned for at least one dusty gravel path walk, with at least one of the boys, and of course, I was hoping it would be one of the shiny born and raised who would choose me for a stroll. Navy dress, stiff white blouse, fabric-wrapped buttons, hair pulled so tight I gave myself a temporary facelift well before I needed one. I was clearly in the game. Someone\u2019s mother stopped me on my way out of the Sleeping Barn after I\u2019d shellacked my hair in place. I\u2019m confident she told herself she was helping. \u201CHow\u2019s your mother doing?\u201D she asked, her tone less inquiry, more accusation. She knew my mum didn\u2019t attend meetings, and that unspoken failing always hung heavy in the air, a shadow on the piety I tried hard to show. The hem hit mid-shin. The top\u2019s neckline sat just below my throat. Buttons and hooks pressed my chest into compliance. Every visible inch had been cleared by some internal modesty calculator I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d built. Still, it wasn\u2019t enough. Because it was never enough. The navy dress under the securely fastened and modest blouse? It was strapless. I knew I\u2019d never wear it that way, but the thrill of seeing myself in the changing room mirror when I\u2019d tried it on had been too much to resist. Maybe it had given me a fire in the eye this boy\u2019s mother caught a glimpse of, maybe she connected it to what she knew was under my sedate top, had seen me when I\u2019d dressed in the Barn. Her words were innocuous, all harm done with tone\u2014a thing I\u2019d become adept at discerning. I hadn\u2019t understood then I was dangerous, I wouldn\u2019t for a while yet. But she did, and she took a moment to let me know. The system was brilliant. You couldn\u2019t follow the rules. Not all of them. Not completely. And that kept you trying. Kept you quiet. By the end of my first year of high school, I was changing outfits in the bathroom. Skirt on the bus, jeans for the school day, reversed before going home. Other 2x2s didn\u2019t ask; they weren\u2019t aware of my double life. People at school\u2014including many concerned or simply curious teachers\u2014asked all the time about the dress to jeans swap, and depending on my mood, I answered with short or even shorter explanations. My mood, to be clear, was generally not good, so whatever the length of my explanation, it was delivered with the fury only teenagers can so quickly tap. It wasn\u2019t the rules (that were of course not rules at all) that broke me. It was how perfectly they worked. Every outfit a test. Every gaze an exam. The trick wasn\u2019t to appear modest as much as it was to set yourself apart from the World. Signify different, embody meekness. I was an example, they said. I was, but not of what they implied. I functioned as an exact replica of subjugation, and I became complicit in vanquishing, of vanishing, my self.Once I started dipping out of the compliance charade, once I couldn\u2019t ignore conversations with myself about what made sense and what didn\u2019t, I still only deviated from the rules out of sight. This is a complicated thing to do at that age, and while I didn\u2019t (thank heavens) develop into a prairie Sybil, splitting myself in two for years didn\u2019t do much for my development. When splitting myself in two wasn\u2019t an option anymore, I left. Another story, for another day. But after that, my first fully and completely defiance? It was wearing jeans in public, a thing I\u2019d by then frequenty done, but my dissidence was found in not changing after I got home. No hidden skirt in my backpack, no mental checklist. No constant scanning for the ones who might catch me out. Just me, in blue jeans. No one died, but it sure felt like I might when Dad came home that day. He didn\u2019t say a word, but to use a tired phrase, if looks could kill, I\u2019d have been flat on the floor, laid out in, of course, a demure skirt. My mutinies stacked on themselves, my external appearance becoming an unsubtle battlefield against 2x2 dictates. Years later, I cut my hair. Not as a statement. Well, maybe it was, or it\u2019s likely I wouldn\u2019t have chosen the pixie cut that made me look like the scissors were nearby and I was feeling some things. Workers had often warned us about slippery slopes, implying the seemingly benign disguised a quick gateway to hell. Everything Worldly, defined explicitly and implicitly, inevitably led to a life on earth devoid of meaning and worse. They preached an afterlife of regret for being too weak to walk in the world without being of it. Publicly breaking the rules did not, of course, lead to my ruin. It led, first, to relief, although that lightness was tempered by dragging what I knew was not sin\u2014but felt like it\u2014behind me, a small, heavy thing weighting me down. And it was a long time before I assimilated myself into me, which is why I\u2019ve struggled until now to write much more than beyond the surface of these years. Oh, you know, I found that skirt recently, the one with 57 buttons. Found the strapless blue dress, too (I\u2019d forgotten it had a thin, stiff crinoline, which was why it kept its shape so well) and its white blouse topper. I held it up to myself in the mirror, crumpled and sad looking after nearly forty years in a storage bin. I saw myself at that moment. Tired and pale, 51 and far from young, but I saw her in the mirror, too. When last she wore that dress she hadn\u2019t yet inhabited rage\u2014but it was so close. It was so close to her. My heart ached for her, knowing what was coming, and how hard it would be. But the tired face looking back at me? There was something important in it, and I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t miss it. Dark circles, yes. But that face was also free. For so many years, I\u2019d always been slightly off\u2014too much for the 2x2s, not enough for the rest of the world. I hovered, unbelonging, off balance, and dressed for a heaven I was pretty sure I wasn\u2019t interested in. That hovering has been hard to shake. Maybe it always will be. Secretly keeping a foot in two worlds messes with your sense of self, wrenches you into parts. And while I do what I can to stitch the fragments of those two selves back together, it\u2019s less Kintsugi\u2014elegant, radiant, touched by gold leaf and wisdom\u2014than it is dollar store tape, unsticking at its edges. But maybe reassembly itself is an art form. Maybe it starts with cheap tape and shame and ends with something that catches the light, even if it\u2019s just barely. If you were raised to believe God watches hemlines, you might enjoy what happens next. Modesty might have been next to godliness, but honestly? Comfort is divine. \u25E1\u0308 Reply, leave a comment, or forward this to someone who\u2019s still untangling fashion from faith. Or don\u2019t. You\u2019ve survived worse choices.

This is the first episode of Cultivated, a literary memoir of resilience and reinvention after life in a cult. It\u0027s a story told in essays, unfolding in real time. It begins not with escape or revelation, but with a question: What am I now? Raised in the secretive 2x2s, I\u2019m still untangling what that upbringing gave me, what it stole, and what it means to make something of a life after all that. \u270D\uFE0F Read the full essay and subscribe for future episodes at https://kristenhmcleod.substack.com \u0026#x1f4fa; Watch or listen on YouTube. \u0026#x1f3a7; Subscribe to Cultivated for weekly memoir episodes.

It felt like righteousness \u2014 and something else, too, something no one said out loud.\n\nIn this episode of Cultivated, I return to the site of the 2x2s\u2019 most sacred annual gathering to tell the story of what it was like to grow up in one of the world\u2019s most secretive Christian sects.\n\nThis is Part 1 of the Convention series \u2014 a blend of memory, observation, and survival.\n\n\u2014\n\nCultivated is a video memoir told in fragments. It follows one woman\u2019s journey into \u2014 and out of \u2014 a hidden religion known as the 2x2s. These stories are not a takedown, or a how-to-leave guide.

      "title": "2x2 Definitions \u002B Explications",
      "description": "Quick notes. * These are my own definitions and have absolutely not been blessed by anyone, nor did I run them by others who might want to weigh in. At the same time, I do not think myself the ultimate arbiter to define and explain. That said, this truth is mine\u2014a slippery concept we\u2019ll dissect later. * Two-by-Two rules and definitions shift by region. What follows are from western Canada in the 80s and 90s. 2x2s or more aptly, 2x2 Cult1. what you might know them by, and how members are referred to by outsiders. Not used or accepted by members. Variations incl. the church with no name, Cooneyites, The No-Name Church, and most often, The 2x2 Religion The Truth/The Way1. how 2x2 members refer to their group; The Truth, and sometimes The Way, but only as a necessary shorthand to describe it. Members do not sanction either as official names and, in fact, reject external naming, strongly asserting there is no name. Think of these as natural shorthand; evolved for the people who collectively and rigorously refuse to name their organized pseudo-Christian gatherings. Usage: \u201CI\u2019m so grateful to have found The Truth;\u201D references both the group itself, and the overarching truth of its teachings. Note: when speaking of The Truth or The Way (actually, this applies to most words and concepts defined here), terms are infused with capital letters, but members do not accept these as proper names; these phrases cede to spoken language demands for symbols to reference things. The Friends1. members refer to each other as The Friends, a quick way of establishing in and out; defining membership in a religion who swears itself unorganized and benignly identifies as merely a group of like-minded people who come together for fellowship. i.e. Who, us? they say to anyone who asks. We simply gather to study scripture. No religion here, nothing official! More frequently, queries on name are deflected with questions . Friends are\u2014like many 2x2 rules\u2014defined against literally everyone else who fit neatly into the pejorative World, as used in cautionary tales regarding Worldly People. Aside: I\u2019m getting a strong sense of why, exactly, I dislike extraneous capital letters. The World; Worldly 1. positioning words and quick definers; as in of The World, Worldly people, Worldly things, Worldly wants, ad nauseam. Basically, Worldly is Satan-informed, and there\u2019s a strong dichotomy between Worldly and not. Usage: When I was in the 2x2s, I was not of The World, and I avoided Worldly things and Worldly people. Worldly includes everything not 2x2 informed, so pretty much every thing and every person.The Word1. the word of God. Spoken with reverence, funneled direct via his \u201Cstill, small voice.\u201D Workers1. what might be in other religious orgs called preachers or ministers; Workers go out two by two to share The Word; are \u201Ccalled to the work\u201D (by, of course, that still, small voice of God). Essentially, workers self-select (I crossed out some mean stuff here). These men and women go out in sex-segregated pairs, remain single and homeless, and do God\u2019s most important work of reminding everyone that \u201CThis is a narrow way, and if we swerve on this way, we could go into the ditch.\u201D Most (all?) workers are high-school educated at best and are not trained in any way to be spiritual leaders. Imagine what power means as these uneducated, self-identified messengers hold court over entire communities, dictating who can do (or more often, not do) what, sanctioning (or more often, not sanctioning) events, and offering endless and terrible advice that is often sought, and also often, not sought. Worker Stanley Sharpe said it himself in 1985 or 1986 at Aylesbury Convention: He got part of it right. The 2x2 Origin Story 1. The Truth is a seamless continuation of the apostles sent by Jesus to preach in pairs. No origin story here! History-free. Doing what Jesus commanded the Apostles do back in the day. Yup! Amazeballs. The Truth is a direct lineage from the New Testament, with Workers setting out just like the disciples. Fascinating, how accepted this origin story was (and is) as fact. Overseers of established areas around the world assign Worker pairs to lead regions (hence the 2x2 moniker). These Head Workers then assign Worker pairs to cities and towns, moving them around based on things the faithful are not privy to know (and in the case of reported childhood sexual assaults, moving accused and even prosecuted and convicted pedophiles to other geographic locations.) Redundant, but the origin story is b******t. It feels silly to say it, but it\u2019s important, I think, to be clear. It\u2019s important because its acceptance stems in part from the abject refusal to discuss origins combined with the rigid control exerted by Workers\u2014nearly complete control over topics and conversations. Subtle but rigidly deployed management of 2x2 members means most never engage in questions. Even when knowledge\u2014about how and when the 2x2s originated, became widespread\u2014believers mostly outright rejected facts presented by the brave few who had left the 2x2s and discovered and publicized its history. If you\u2019ve ever asked a 2x2 a direct question about their faith, you\u2019ll know what I mean. Digression and redirection, coupled with responding with another question are tactics to divert giving answers that in fact, members often don\u2019t have. Members who eventually (unwillingly) accepted updated and correct 2x2 origins often engaged, as my Dad finally did, in serious mental gymnastics to cede to the possibility the original version was still somehow correct, and asserted any manmade involvement had been mitigated by the purity of The Truth since. It\u2019s all a bit boring, but in a nutshell, the 2x2s derived in the late 1800s from some offshoot of some other new religion. Evidence and discussions on this abound online, if you\u2019re interested. I\u2019m not particularly anymore, but recommend Wikipedia or one of the many sites organized around unpacking the 2x2s. Workers renounce possessions and money and are instead provided for by 2x2 members. They live with the families assigned to supply this room and board (a troubling method in some of the poverty-stricken lands where they preach) and move frequently from one home to another, travelling with the one small suitcase of clothing and toiletries allotted to each, at the behest of the head worker for their region. The name for these head workers varies across the globe, but typically, is some variation on Overseer. At the various gatherings attended by The Friends, Workers preach what they state is the word of God. They ex-communicate, set rules\u2014some spoken, most implied, but all crystal clear\u2014hide criminal acts of other Workers and guard finances carefully as the ultimate leaders in this authoritarian, high control group. At the 1985 or \u201886 Regina Special Meeting, Sister Worker Mable Jacobs railed against the ever-present temptation to \u201Cgo back into bondage, perhaps because of a loved one who is still in bondage.\u201D I can\u2019t be certain that message was directed to my family, but my mother\u2019s refusal to join the 2x2s was a sore spot for the 2x2s and remained as such for the duration of my time with them, and likely long past me leaving. My mom\u2019s choice to remain in the bondage of the Lutheran church\u2014the one in which she\u2019d been raised, the church where I\u2019d been baptized and had attended my whole life alongside my grandma, cousins, and friends\u2014meant, according to the Workers, that our home was Divided. A girl who had been born into The Truth explained the concept when I asked her if we could play. \u201CMy mother told me I\u2019m not supposed to spend time with you,\u201D she said matter-of-factly. \u201CYou\u2019re from a divided home.\u201D A parental or other family member\u2019s refusal to attend meetings meant the members who did were at risk, and by extension, anyone who consorted with those family members assumed risk simply by associating with them. Mom\u2019s short hair, her earrings and lipstick, the TV only she watched\u2014all of it implied temptation, and most Professing (Professing? Oh snap! The definitions are endless! Up next!) families kept my family at a distance. Dad had made the right choice\u2014the only choice, in fact\u2014by seeking The Truth, and by committing himself and his three children to it. But without his wife by his side, we were not considered fully immersed in The Truth. It wasn\u2019t until much later that I realized we would never have been fully accepted. Born and raised, or B\u0026R, was the only way to full acceptance. Professing 1. is a 2x2\u2019s ongoing, public commitment, signifying membership that was never, ever called membership. To be referred to as Professing, one first had to profess. At a Sunday night Gospel Meeting or during the five-day summer Convention (the barn!), Workers test a meeting by announcing that if anyone has been called by God and wants to answer that call, to share their commitment by standing during the final verse of the next hymn. I admit being on tenterhooks when meetings were tested. Nothing exciting, or even remotely interesting, ever happened at any meeting, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m lying to say most of us craned our necks to see who stood.Of course, longtime attendees had ideas as to who might stand (or who should), but I was amazed by this public demonstration of fidelity. Once this step had been taken, the person was now referred to as Professing, and I noticed the reverence with which the question was asked.\u201CIs she professing,\u201D followed by yes or no, was imbued with unambiguous tone, and it was obvious which was preferred. Professing didn\u2019t much appeal to me (of course, I eventually succumbed). Professing people prayed seated and by turn, during the weekly Sunday Morning Gospel Meetings and Wednesday Night Bible Studies and enjoyed the option of standing to pray by turn in front of hundreds at Convention (the barn!).But Professing wasn\u2019t only prayer. More importantly, Professing people were expected to Give Testimony. Giving, or Sharing, Testimony 1. standing up by turn, reading a Bible verse selected from the person\u2019s private studies (or on Wednesday, from the assigned Bible reading), followed with explication of the person\u2019s understanding of said verse and, crucially, the meaning they derived from it. This was all, of course, informed by the \u201Cstill, small voice of God,\u201D which was a regular occurrence, according to the Workers and Professing people\u2019s Testimonies. These soliloquies ranged from the shortest possible statements delivered rapid-fire to inaudible mumbling to the most painfully long and rambling versions of convoluted thinking even I, a child, frequently identified as gibberish. Workers minister to members of The Truth, understandable as the congregations who attend meetings and conventions, who are known as those In the Way. In the Way/In the Truth1. another quick and dirty method of establishing if a person is one of The Friends or Of the World, the only two possible categories a person could be in. In the Way of Jesus, In the Way of righteousness, blah blah blah. There are more of these definitions and I\u2019ll get to them, but it\u2019s a bit tedious, no? Necessary, though, I imagine. The thing about redefining language? It bothered me then and still bothers me now. I\u2019d far rather the engrams and anatens and enthetas of scientology because if you left, you could reasonably expect to never hear those words again. But truth? Friends? The world? I had to take them back, a thing that got easier with time, but is still work (work!) to do, and always small but constant reminders I am not in the way, that I\u2019ve chosen bondage. It\u2019s okay. I made that decision long ago. If the choice is hell or the 2x2s? I\u2019ll take hell. And choose it every single day. Subscribing means you\u2019ll get weekly posts. It also makes it easier for former 2x2s to find this (algorithms, apparently). But no pressure. Drop in, drop by. It\u2019s nice to have you. To hear more, visit kristenhmcleod.substack.com",
