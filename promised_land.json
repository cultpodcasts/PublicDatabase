He experienced failures in returning to Indiana to show off his accomplishments, and failures in taking over Mother Devine\u0027s Peace Mission. Jim Jones refused to stop working, so he turned to drugs. Drugs made him paranoid, and his extramarital affairs spiral out of control. He also introduced the Planning Commission, which was the first step in The Peoples Temple becoming an authoritarian system. Research and audio clips are credited to The Jonestown Institute.
