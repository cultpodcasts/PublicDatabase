      "description": "My friend who hosts her own channel, \u201CRedacted Apostate\u201D, was kind and brave enough to share her terrible dating experience with me.  She offers detailed love and dating challenges within the cult she was raised in through her Mom.  Although she managed to leave the cult and have a normal life, the scars are all too visible and telling as she recites the story with trepidation.",
