      "description": "Hi, friends! Happy Wednesday! What if I told you that one of the most influential... and mysterious cult leaders in American history is someone most people have never heard of? And that Jim Jones himself, yes Jonestown Jim Jones, got many of his ideas from same guy? Today, we\u2019re diving into the wild and complicated story of Father Divine\u2014the charismatic leader behind the Peace Mission Movement, a man who inspired millions, shaped pieces of the civil rights era, built entire communities from the ground up\u2026 and also demanded unwavering loyalty that crossed more than a few lines. This isn\u2019t your typical cult story. It\u2019s part spiritual revolution, part empire-building, part \u201Cwait, WHAT?!\u201D And somehow still a chapter of American history no one talks about. And we should because it brings up an interesting question... Where\u2019s the line between a movement that helps people\u2026 and one that controls them? And at what point does something become a cult? Let\u2019s get into the Dark History of Father Divine.
