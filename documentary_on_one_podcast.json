      "description": "Paul \u2013 not his real name \u2013 is in his thirties, and he has never had a sexual or romantic relationship. He goes to work and gets on with his colleagues but nobody knows the life of quiet despair that he lives. Nobody knows that he is an \u2018incel\u2019. Incels \u2013 or involuntary celibates - are men who define themselves as people who cannot find anybody to have a romantic or sexual relationship with, despite wanting one. Incels hang out on the darker fringes of the Internet, commiserating with each other and venting about women and society. It is a deeply misogynistic space, filled with hate speech. It is also filled with loneliness and sadness. Incels, especially in Ireland, rarely speak to the media but we delve into the world of inceldom and discover what the world looks like through their eyes. Warning: This documentary contains adult themes, discusses offensive themes, violence and suicide that could be upsetting or triggering for some people, so please take care. Narrated by Alan Bradley. Produced by Alan Bradley and Nicoline Greer (2024) Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",
