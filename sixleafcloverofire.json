      "description": "This was obviously a really hard video for me to make. There\u0027s a lot I needed to say. There was a lot more TO say as well. There are things I wanted to say but forgot. There are things I didn\u0027t even expect I\u0027d say. To anybody who has had religious trauma, I am so sorry. I really hope this video can help people, or at least help people realize they need help. Perhaps people have had a similar experience before. I know there are people who have suffered much worse due to religion. I consider myself to be lucky, and I\u0027m glad that I\u0027m finally free. I am sorry for all the pain I have ever caused anybody. I love you all very much.\n\n- Tyler",
