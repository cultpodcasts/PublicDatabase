      "description": "A recent Reddit post shared a heartfelt story about a son who wasn\u0027t invited to his father\u0027s memorial service by his grandmother. She explained that, due to recent events (likely directed at her disapproval of someone\u0027s behavior \uD83D\uDE44), he was only allowed to join via Zoom. It\u2019s truly sad to see how sometimes Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses seem to prioritize their religious community over family connections. In this case, the grandmother chose the governing body over her own grandson and granddaughter, which is really heartbreaking. #exjw #exvangelical #deconstruction #cultsurvivor #jehovahswitness #jehovahwitness #jehovahswitnesses #religioustrauma #deconversion #watchtower #governingbody #jehovahwitnesses #shunned #shun #disfellowshipped #disfellowship #shunning",

      "description": "For years, I lived a double life, believing I could be responsible for others\u0027 eternal fate. Outwardly, I was a \u201Cgood\u201D Jehovah\u2019s Witness, attending meetings, saying the right things (or at least trying to, playing the part). But inside, I was torn\u2014doubting, drifting, pretending.\n\nThis episode of Cult Drop Out explores what it means to be caught between two worlds. Wanting to be your authentic self while also feeling like you owe something to Jehovah. Many people move past doubt and confusion to become PIMO\u2014physically in, mentally out. It\u2019s that gray area many of us get trapped in when we start questioning the doctrine but can\u2019t leave without risking everything: family, community, even our sense of self.\n\nLiving in two worlds takes a toll. You learn to mask, to perform, to suppress. You become skilled at surviving, but at what cost? This is our one opportunity and we should be living, thriving, not planning to die. \n\n#exjw #jehovahswitnesses #jehovahswitness #jehovahwitness #jehovahwitnesses #indoctrination #cult #cultsurvivor #watchtower #governingbody #deconversion #deconstruction #exvangelical #exmo #spiritualabuse #disfellowshipped",

      "description": "I wasn\u2019t raised to think critically. I was raised to obey.\nIn this episode of\u00A0Cult Drop Out, I talk about how being raised in a high-control religion like Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses shaped my early political beliefs, or more accurately, suppressed them. I was taught to stay \u201Cneutral,\u201D to avoid politics, to keep my head down and wait for God to fix everything. For instance, I was discouraged from participating in elections or even discussing political issues as a JW.\nBut the moment I started waking up from the cult, I began to question the teachings and the control. I started waking up\u00A0everywhere else\u00A0too, noticing the world around me with a new perspective, free from the constraints of the organization\u0027s beliefs.\nThis is the story of how I went from apolitical to aware. From silence to speaking up. And from blindly obedient to becoming radically intentional. It\u0027s a process that requires determination and self-reflection.\nIf you\u2019ve ever found yourself shedding not just a religion, but an entire worldview, this one\u2019s for you.\nI hope I can embolden you to share your trip around the sun with the rest of the world too.

A blood transfusion could have saved the young mother\u0027s life, but her doctor refused for religious reasons.\n\nThis is the tragic story out of Port Harcourt, Nigeria, that should shake us all.

Staying silent only shields those who still hold the power.  \uD83D\uDE14\n\nWalking away didn\u2019t just mean ditching doctrines; it was like peeling off layers of programming wrapped around me since I was a kid.\n\nThis video dives into what it\u2019s really like to leave a cult- the confusion, grief, vulnerability\u2026 and the strength that comes with reclaiming your voice. \n\nI discuss how groups like the Watchtower shape your thoughts, bury your instincts, and call it righteousness.

What no one tells you is that leaving is just the beginning. You don\u2019t just lose a religion. You lose your sense of self, your community, your family, and everything that once gave you a script to live by. That\u2019s when the seams started to come apart. Because when you\u2019ve been fully immersed, your thoughts aren\u2019t fully your own. This is what deconstruction looks like for me. When Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses say they study the Bible, what they really mean is they study the Watchtower\u2019s interpretation of it. Study is done through pre-approved literature, carefully crafted, loaded with bias, and presented as fact. You\u2019re not encouraged to seek truth. You\u2019re trained to absorb what you\u2019re given. You\u2019re not gaining insight. You\u2019re being steered. The Watchtower talks about \u201Cspiritual armor,\u201D but that armor wasn\u2019t protecting me \u2014 it was hiding me. It was a disguise I was expected to wear to blend in, obey quietly, and never make waves. It made me into someone loyal, passive, and unquestioning. Every belief I questioned loosened those threads. And once it started coming off, I felt exposed. Raw. Vulnerable. Disoriented. I found myself asking, \u201CIs this really who I am\u2026 or just who I was trained to be?\u201D As a woman, I was taught selflessness was godliness and obedience was a virtue. The men got authority. I got quiet approval. Looking back, I see what it really was: gendered obedience wrapped in religious language. That realization made me angry \u2014 at them, at the control, and at myself for believing it for so long. But that anger helped me set boundaries, speak up, and stop apologizing for being who I am. I used to think doubt meant failure. But when the system only allows one narrative, any independent thought feels like betrayal. The truth is, I wasn\u2019t trying to walk away. I was just\u2026 thinking. Reading. Asking questions. And the whole thing started to collapse. The Watchtower doesn\u2019t prove the Bible. The Bible doesn\u2019t prove the Watchtower. They just point to each other in a closed loop. That realization didn\u2019t bring peace \u2014 it brought grief, confusion, and rage. But that rage led to healing. Healing, for me, looks like trusting myself again, letting go of guilt around joy, and refusing to stay quiet when injustice hides behind a religious mask. Rebuilding hasn\u2019t been easy. But it\u2019s been real. And that\u2019s why I speak up. Because organizations like the Watchtower thrive in silence. They\u2019re wealthy, protected, and strategic. But what they\u2019re guarding isn\u2019t faith \u2014 it\u2019s power. That\u2019s why I\u2019m loud. That\u2019s why I speak out about cults, deconstruction, and religious trauma. Because your body, your mind, your voice \u2014 they\u2019re sacred. When people say \u201Cjust move on,\u201D I wonder how they can ignore the harm still happening. I speak because I refuse to let the next generation grow up thinking control is love. And I\u2019m just getting started. I\u2019ll be making more videos \u2014 sharing my perspective on cults, deconstruction, and what it means to rebuild when the old life was built on fear. If you\u2019re on that journey too, you\u2019re not alone. We\u2019re finding our voices again. And that\u2019s sacred, too.",
