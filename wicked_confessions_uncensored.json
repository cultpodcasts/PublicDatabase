      "description": "Forget \u201Csister wife solidarity\u201D. This is the real story behind the group of seven women who became a living nightmare for dozens of innocent co-wives.\nIn this explosive episode, Vera and Pamela expose the unfiltered truth of a vicious polygamist \u201Cfriend group\u201D who plotted to humiliate, emotionally destroy, and control their sister wives\u2026 all while sipping wine and quoting scripture.\nFrom cutting power during intimate nights, to chili-rubbed underwear pranks, fake hickeys, public humiliation, spying through windows, gossip warfare, and even sabotaging birthdays and funerals, this was more than jealousy. It was a cult inside a cult.\nThey called them \u201CThe Thugs\u201D, a sisterhood of butch-cut ring leaders and wannabe queens who weaponized friendship to gain clout and crush anyone who dared look happy.\nThis is polygamy like you\u2019ve never heard it. Raw. Hilarious. Disturbing. And yes, somehow\u2026 still healing.\n\u26A0\uFE0F Listener discretion advised: you will laugh, cringe, and maybe want to throw hands on behalf of these women.\n\uD83C\uDF99\uFE0F As always, no polygamists were harmed, or denied their celestial kingdom, in the making of this podcast\u2026 at least we hope not. \uD83D\uDE09\nWicked Confessions Uncensored \nWebsite | Tiktok | Facebook | Instagram | Email",
