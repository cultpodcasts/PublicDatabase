      "description": "In one of our most unfiltered episodes yet, we peel back the layers of sexual hypocrisy in the cult we escaped\u2014and expose how silence protects predators.

Join us as we share not just the trauma, but the power that comes from finally telling the truth. If you\u2019ve ever struggled to speak up, felt silenced by religion, or questioned the systems meant to protect you\u2014this is for you. And if you\u0027re still healing, just know: you\u2019re not alone. \u26A0\uFE0F Trigger warning: This episode discusses sexual abuse, religious manipulation, and child grooming.
