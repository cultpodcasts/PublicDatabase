      "description": "Heaven\u0027s Gate was an American new religious movement founded in 1974 and led by Marshall Applewhite (1931\u20131997) and Bonnie Nettles (1927\u20131985), known within the movement as Do and Ti.

In 1976, a core group of a few dozen members stopped recruiting and instituted a monastic lifestyle.\n\nIf you like my videos, please consider joining my Patreon.
