      "description": "In this deeply moving episode of Let Glory Shine, host Martha Glory Kartaoui sits down with a familiar face from her past, Orpah Sindt, a fellow survivor from the same cult that shaped much of their early lives. For the first time on camera, these two courageous women open up about their individual journeys through trauma, indoctrination, and spiritual abuse, and what it meant to finally reunite in Dallas just one month ago after years of separation.\n\nOrpah shares her own raw testimony, revealing the emotional toll of her experience and the strength it took to reclaim her voice. Together, they explore the complexities of healing, the power of being seen, and what happens when two survivors come full circle in truth and transformation.\n\nThis is more than a conversation. It\u2019s a divine intersection. A sacred homecoming.\n\nLet Glory Shine...a light in the darkness for every Battle Angel who has ever felt alone in their pain. Don\u2019t miss this unforgettable episode.\n\n#LetGloryShine #CultSurvivor #HealingJourney #Reunion #TraumaRecovery #FaithAndFreedom",
