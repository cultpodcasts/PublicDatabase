      "description": "ABSTRACT\nThe cult of Dionysos Phallen centred on a mysterious olive-wood face dredged up from the Aegean by fishermen and worshipped at Methymna as a representation of Dionysos. In trying to make sense of this cult, scholars have privileged the evidence of two relatively late writers of the 2nd c. CE who were not from Lesbos over earlier evidence from Lesbos itself, above all the iconography of each city\u2019s coinage. This has resulted in awkward attempts to make the evidence for similar-looking cults at other cities on Lesbos somehow relate to Methymna\u2019s cult. In reality, the history of these similar-looking but different cults of Dionysos in each city tell an important story about how competing impulses of competition and collaboration shaped the intra-island dynamic of Lesbos throughout antiquity.",
