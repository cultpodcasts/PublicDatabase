      "description": "Paul takes us on a journey that spans more than 80 years. After spending 10 years in the ministry in the Washington State region during the 1960s, he brings a wealth of knowledge and firsthand insight into the inner workings of the 2x2 church. Hearing how his beliefs have evolved over the decades, and where he stands today, is a powerful reminder that we never have to settle for beliefs that don\u2019t resonate with us at our core.\n\nWant to support the project? https://coff.ee/beyondreligion",
