She discusses how these early dynamics influenced her journey through grief after losing her husband, and the steps that led her to seek solace in what she believed to be a spiritual path, which turned out to be a horrific cult.\n\nIsabella shares how losing her son to death within the cult, was the eye-opening, pivotal moment that pushed her to leave, and the personal growth that followed. This conversation explores the effects of family dynamics on mental health, the complexities of grief, and the importance of self-awareness and resilience when rebuilding after life-altering experiences.\n\nThis episode provides insights into overcoming personal and external challenges and highlights the power of self-discovery and transformation. @feelingbetternaturally1099\n\nYou can find Isabella on:\nEmail: isabellayoung19@gmail.com\nWebsite and books: www.feelingbetternaturally.love\nSubstack: https://www.substack.com/@feelingbetternaturally\n\nPlease visit our website to get more information: https://www.multispective.org/ \n     \n\u2B50 \u2B50 Audio Podcast is currently on all audio platforms:\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6Ww9d7Hmq6CfdKwN21CC09?si=f97ba8d52 \nApple Podcast: https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/multispective/id1604126986  \n\n* You can find me:\n\nWebsite: https://www.multispective.org/ \nFacebook: http://facebook.com/multispectiveorg    \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/multispectiveorg/  \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@multispectiveorg\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Multispective_ \nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/multispective \nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/multispective/\n\nWant to be a guest on the podcast?

      "description": "Fairy shares her painful journey through the troubled teen industry. For many, these facilities are sold as places for \u0022help\u0022 or \u0022reform,\u0022 but behind their walls, children are often taken from their homes, subjected to harsh treatment, and forced into programs that can leave lasting emotional and psychological scars.\n\nFairy opens up about being taken from her family and sent to a facility where she faced abuse, isolation, and intense discipline. She speaks candidly about the trauma, the broken systems, and how many kids\u2014like herself\u2014are treated as though they need to be \u201Cfixed\u201D instead of being supported with love and understanding. Despite the darkness, Fairy\u0027s story is one of resilience, hope, and the strength to reclaim her own voice.\n\n\uD83D\uDD14\uD83C\uDF0D Please subscribe to support the podcast, and tune into some riveting true mental health stories on overcoming trauma and finding success \uD83C\uDFA7\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@multispectivepodcast/tutorials?sub_confirmation=1 \n     \n\u2B50 \u2B50  Audio Podcast is currently on all platforms:\n\n\uD83D\uDC49Spotify:https://open.spotify.com/show/6Ww9d7Hmq6CfdKwN21CC09?si=f97ba8d52 \n\uD83D\uDC49Apple Podcast: https://podcasts.apple.com/hk/podcast/multispective/id1604126986  \n\n\u2705  Stay Connected With Us\n\n\uD83C\uDF10 Website: https://www.multispective.org/ \n\uD83D\uDC49Facebook: http://facebook.com/multispectiveorg    \n\uD83D\uDC49Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/multispectiveorg/  \n\uD83D\uDC49Twitter: https://twitter.com/Multispective_ \n\uD83D\uDC49Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/multispective \n\uD83D\uDC49Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/multispective/\n\n\u2705 If you have a story you\u0027d like to share with us, please email us: info@multispective.org    \n\n=============================\n\n\u2705  Other Videos You Might Be Interested In Watching: \n\n\uD83D\uDC49 I escaped from Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RprhrvPzhKM\u0026t=2s\n\n\uD83D\uDC49  I tried ayahuasca to heal from childhood trauma \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3fq4ZrK4Ao \n\n\uD83D\uDC49 I was an army general battling with bipolar disorder\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvCLMzEGeEE \n\n\uD83D\uDC49 I ended a toxic marriage after a fire destroyed my home \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKddbZ24hyw\u0026t=2854s\n\n\uD83D\uDC49 My brittle bones have broken over 200 times\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkVDgtgXe3c  \n\n=============================\n\n\u2705  About Multispective Podcast\n\nMultispective is a podcast that shares true, riveting, and unique stories of people worldwide.

      "description": "Obscurity shares her heartbreaking story of surviving familial trafficking, abuse, and torture at the hands of her parents and brother. She reveals the unimaginable trauma she endured during her childhood and the lifelong pain she has carried since.\n\nThrough her candid account, Obscurity sheds light on the hidden reality of familial abuse and the impact it has on survivors. Despite the darkness she\u2019s faced, her story is one of courage and resilience, offering hope to others who have endured similar experiences.\n\nThis episode dives deep into the importance of breaking the silence, raising awareness about trafficking within families, and supporting survivors in their healing journey.\n\nFamilial trafficking involves exploiting a child within their own family for goods, money, or services, often by parents but also by other relatives like siblings or guardians. In child sex trafficking, victims may be groomed or coerced into sexual acts, often linked to the creation and distribution of child sexual abuse material.\n\nPlease visit our website to get more information: https://www.multispective.org/ \n\n\uD83D\uDD14\uD83C\uDF0D Want to hear more life stories from around the world?
