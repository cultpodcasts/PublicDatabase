The WMSCOG says we need to keep all of their feasts, regulations and basically whatever they deem necessary.\n\nBut is that how the bible describes salvation being given? If so then amen, we should do as the WMSCOG say. But if the bible doesn\u0027t say that, are you willing to let go of the WMSCOG and follow the bible. Are you willing to free yourself from their grasp and follow the bible? Only you can decide that for yourself.\n\nI am going to make this very simple. You are saved by faith. It is through faith that you are justified, it is through faith that you are able to do good works, it is through faith that you are made righteous in God\u0027s sight.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed on this channel are solely those of the narrator and or guests.

      "description": "**Grab Your Bibles**  This is Part 3 of 3 - You Made It!!\n\n**Summary of Content**\n1. Clement of Alexandria wrote Paedagogus (The Tutor) published in 198 AD. In which gives commentary on John 6:53-54 \u0022The flesh figuratively represents to us the Holy Spirit; for the flesh was created by Him. The blood points out to us the Word, for as rich blood the Word has been infused into life\u0022\n2. Eusebius of Caesarea wrote Ecclesiastical History between 312 and 324 CE. What is the really happening between Polycrates and Victor? Why is it important?\n3. Polycarp received the office of Consecrating from Pope Victor after the first Easter controversy. \n4. Irenaeus (Polycarp\u0027s Disciple) kept the Eucharist on Resurrection Sunday. Polycrates has no problem with that, His issue was the Excommunication by Pope Victor.\n5. Hippolytus (Irenaeus\u0027 Disciple) in Apostolic Traditions taught that the oblation (Eucharist) is done on Sunday. In his book (Refutation of all Heresies Book VIII) he taught that insisting on the Jewish way ( Quartodecimans) is heretical.\n6. Constantine never abolished the Passover in 325 AD, he merely gathered bishops all over the world and told them to deal with Arianism firstly, and then resolve the dissention between churches in regards to Easter. The leaders of the Church voted to celebrate it on Resurrection Sunday.\n7. The Jewish calendar has been changed multiple times and even has buffer months and leap years. The reason is to keep the Passover from coming to early before the lambs are ready.\n8. Irenaeus said that we should not follow the Jewish view of the Eucharist (Fragments of Irenaeus)\n9. What does the Didache (Teaching 70-150AD) say about the Eucharist?\n10. \u0022Breaking bread\u0022 is synonymous with Eucharist.\n12. The 3 reasons why I show all this history. First Church history is a lot more messy than you think it is. Second, we should know all the church history, not just the history that fits WMSCOG. Third, the churches all did different things.\n13. The bible doesn\u0027t condemn those who DO NOT keep the WMSCOG\u0027s version of New Covenant Passover.\n\n**Works Cited**\nfile:///C:/Users/a041286.FBDOMAIN/Downloads/29251-john-or-paul-who-was-polycarp-s-mentor.pdf\nhttps://www.google.com/books/edition/Ecclesiastical_History/xqU8AAAAYAAJ?hl=en\u0026gbpv=1\u0026bsq=Passover\nhttps://www.christian-history.org/polycarps-philippian-epistle.html\nhttps://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01637a.htm\nhttps://www.stjohnsarlingtonva.org/Customer-Content/saintjohnsarlington/CMS/files/EFM/Apostolic_Tradition_by_Hippolytus.pdf\nhttps://www.newadvent.org/fathers/02091.htm\nhttps://wwhttps://auth.scribd.com/u/signup?state=hKFo2SBMMC1ZSXdweUhaMDN0OGpoSDZWTWw5QjFTckNtZXU5N6Fur3VuaXZlcnNhbC1sb2dpbqN0aWTZIC1fMHBhYy1TZDVIZEg2SlZUSVVWMHptVlkxMXJFaWhWo2NpZNkgZ3ljN3lyZnpzdkpmaXd5bHNlYXU4Y3g5dVZhb2FOU1A\u0026ui_locales=enw.newadvent.org/fathers/050108.htm\nhttps://biblehub.com/hebrew/6153.htm\nhttps://www.evidenceunseen.com/bible-difficulties-2/nt-difficulties/john-acts/jn-131-does-john-contradict-the-synoptics-regarding-the-passover-meal/\nhttps://blogs.ancientfaith.com/wholecounsel/2019/05/29/calendars-old-and-new/\nhttps://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11446b.htm\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=cL5lAAAAMAAJ\u0026dq=Quartodeciman\u002BOrthodox\u0026pg=PA307#v=onepage\u0026q=Quartodeciman%20Orthodox\u0026f=false\nhttps://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/3920-calendar-history-of\nhttps://legacyicons.com/content/didache.pdf\nhttps://www.newadvent.org/fathers/25023.htm\nhttps://www.cs.cornell.edu/info/people/kreitz/Christian/Cults/5.armstrong.pdf\nhttps://www.google.com/books/edition/Ecclesiastical_History/xqU8AAAAYAAJ?hl=en\u0026gbpv=1\u0026pg=PR38\u0026printsec=frontcover\n\nThe views and opinions expressed on this channel are solely those of the narrator and or guests.

Armstrong actually fulfills the 7 Churches prophecy as well\n3. Is restoration about the 1st month 14th day or is about the belief in God\n4. Is the WMSCOG the first and only Church that teaches bread and wine is for forgiveness of sins and eternal life?\n5. There were two calendars in ancient Judaism. Passover was kept by the Pharisee\u0027s on 1.13 and the Sadducees kept Passover on 1.14.\n6. Matthew, Mark and Luke write from a Pharisaic point of view. John rights from a Sadducean point of view.\n7. New Covenant (Jesus\u0027 Blood) sets us free from the food, drink and external regulations of the old covenant.\n8. WMSCOG says we still need food, drink and external regulations.\n9. Sacrifices done every year do not forgive sins.\n10. Jesus blood forgives once and for all, He is not sacrificed year after year.\n11. New Covenant Passover doesn\u0027t forgive sins once and for all, if it did you wouldn\u0027t need to keep it year after year.\n12. Hebrew never mentions the bread and wine regulation at all when speaking of the New Covenant.\n13. Where is the phrases \u0022New Covenant Passover\u0022, \u0022Feasts of the New Covenant\u0022 in the Bible?\n14. Eucharist is in the bible, the Greek word for \u0022thanksgiving\u0022 or \u0022cup of thanksgiving\u0022 is eucharistia. That is why the early church refers to the bread and wine as eucharist, meaning eucharist is in the bible, New Covenant Passover is not.\n15. Old Covenant Passover regulation involves bread and wine, so the premise of the New Covenant being bread and wine is invalid as that was required for the Old Covenant to be observed.\n16. Jesus gave the wine twice during the last supper not just once.\n17. Jesus got up FROM the meal to wash His disciples feet, meaning they had already started eating before the feet were washed. This contradicts WMSCOG teaching of you must wash the feet before the Passover to eat it.\n18. John never mentions bread and wine in his gospel, ever. Which means that Jesus flesh and blood in John 6 must mean something else. John tells us Jesus words are spirit and they are life.\n\n**Works Cited**\nhttps://www.cs.cornell.edu/info/people/kreitz/Christian/Cults/5.armstrong.pdf\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Miller_(preacher)#CITEREFMiller1845\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_God_(Seventh_Day)\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_W._Armstrong\nhttps://www.biblegateway.com/\nhttps://www.google.com/books/edition/Chronological_Aspects_of_the_Life_of_Chr/fS28b9GC1dcC?hl=en\u0026gbpv=1\u0026pg=PA9\u0026printsec=frontcover\nhttps://www.thetruewmscog.com/ahnsahnghong-or-armstrong-who-restored-the-passover-first/\nhttps://biblehub.com/text/matthew/26-27.htm\nhttps://www.gotquestions.org/transubstantiation.html\n\nThe views and opinions expressed on this channel are solely those of the narrator and or guests.

Watch this video to uncover the truth about Christ Ahnsahnghong, WMSCOG, and the controversial teachings of this religious group known as the \u0022Book of Life\u0022.\n\n **Grab Your Bibles** it is much easier to follow along.\n\n**Content Summary**\n1. The Old Testament words \u0022blotted our of Heaven\u0022 or \u0022blotted out of the book of the living\u0022 has the meaning of God will destroy them.\n2. God keeps records of everything we do, but not in physical books rather keeps records in heaven.\n3. Are Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and all the prophets in the book of life? If so, then where is that physical book to confirm?\n4. The meaning of \u0022whatever you bind on earth has been bound in heaven\u0022 is understood as a Chaldean and rabbinical idiom to forbid, prohibit, declare to be illicit. \n5. The meaning  \u0022whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven\u0022 is understood as a Chaldean and Talmudic usage to declare lawful.\n6.  It simply means that whatever was done in Heaven has already been done, the apostles are just carrying it out. Not that the Apostles can do whatever they want and it\u0027s done in heaven.\n7. If the book of life is physical book? What happens if there is fire or a flood and that book is destroyed? What if your name is spell wrong? What if someone in charge doesn\u0027t like you and erases your name?\n8. GP and Mother\u0027s names are written in the book of life allegedly in the NCPCOG which is lead by Ahnsahnghong\u0027s son Pastor Ahn Kwang Sup. What if Pastor Kwang blotted out GP and Mother\u0027s name from the original book of life? Does that mean they wont go to heaven?\n9. In Rev 3:5 the book of life appears in the Church of Sardis (1798-1834 AD) according to the 7 Churches prophecy. Which is considered the age of reformers. Then did the reformers restore the physical book of life? Why does the bible say the book of life appears in the Church of Sardis then?\n10. The physical \u0022book of life\u0022 in MY OPINION is a control tactic. It is used to scare and manipulate people into doing the churches bidding.\n11. God\u0027s salvation is between you and Him. Not some physical perishable book that can be used as blackmail. God\u0027s providence is much more infallible and righteous than that.\n\n**Time Stamp**\n0:00 Intro to video\n0:46 WMSCOG Book of Life Doctrine Breakdown\n5:05 \u0022blotting out\u0022 \u0022written in heaven\u0022 Old Testament Contextual Analysis\n13:44 \u0022blotting out\u0022 \u0022written in heaven\u0022 New Testament Contextual Analysis\n17:03 \u0022bind on earth, bound in heaven, loose on earth, loosed in heaven\u0022 Contextual Analysis\n19:50 Fallacies of having a physical book of life.\n22:53 How to have your name written in the book of life in HEAVEN\n24:13 Conclusion of the WMSCOG Book of Life doctrine\n25:57 Pray with me, if not NO PROBLEM at all.

      "description": "**Grab Your Bibles** it will be a lot easier to follow along.\n\n**Summary of Contents**\n1. Han Enoch \u0022Han Jin-kyo\u0022 correctly predicted in 1947 the year of 1948 being the restoration of Israel in his book \u0022Eternal Gospel\u0022\n2. Reverend Moon of the Unification Church also taught that 1948 was the restoration of Israel and was a sign of second coming.\n3. Mark 11:12-14, 20-21 is about praying without doubt.\n4. Luke 13:6-9 and Luke 21:20-21 is about the destruction of Jerusalem.\n5. \u0022until\u0022 the time of the gentiles is fulfilled implies the restoration of Israel. \n6. The fig tree blossoming has a different context than \u0022until the time of the gentiles are fulfilled\u0022.\n7. When you see the fig tree and all the trees start to blossoming you know that summer is near. This is a parable.\n8. When you see all these things happening \u0022wars, earthquakes, uprisings, false Christs, etc.\u0022 you know He is near. This is the interpretation Jesus gave.\n9. The fig tree blossoming is not 1948, but it is the fulfillment of \u0022until\u0022.\n10. IF the 1948 was the year. Jesus said that THIS generation will NOT pass away.\n11. Most of the generation of 1948 has passed away.\n12. Ahnsahnghong taught that the \u0022generation\u0022 regarding the fig tree was 40 years. 1940 \u002B 40 years = 1988, which should have been the end.

      "description": "**Grab Your Bibles** It will be so much easier to follow along. I promise.\n\n**Summary of Important Points**\n1. Reverend Moon taught that Daniel 7:13 was about first coming and that clouds mean flesh in his book \u0022Divine Principle\u0022 1951.\n2. Does Jesus come \u0022like a cloud\u0022 or \u0022on the clouds\u0022? Big Difference. Therefore Proverbs 25 and Jude verse 12 are not relevant. \n3. Mt 24:20-31, How can the people of the earth all mourn when they see the second coming IF it is a SECRET coming that no one knows.\n4. 1 Th 4:16 talks of the trumpet being sounded on Judgement day. Jesus says trumpets will sound at His second coming Mt 24:31.\n5. People and the world is a time of great distress unequaled from the beginning never to be equaled again both on Judgement Day and Second Coming. Mt 24:21, 29, Lk 21:26 \u0026 1 Th 5:1-3\n6. Jesus can come to Judge and Save at the same time at Second Coming. Just like how WMSCOG teaches Ahnsahnghong comes to Judge and to Save at the same time.\n7. In Ex 13:21 God appeared as a pillar of fire and cloud on the same day.\n8. Lk 21:18 \u0022These things\u0022 means more than one event. When \u0022these things begin to take place\u0022 verse 8-28, that is when your redemption is NEAR. Your redemption is HERE when second coming Christ comes.\n9. Sign in the sun, moon and starts happens before the dreadful day of the lord and second coming, Mt 24:29-30, Is 13:19-13, 34:1-4 \u0026 Joel 2:28-31.\n10. Daniel 7:13 is about second coming Jesus. The son of man comes on the clouds AFTER the little horn (anti-Christ).\n11. Rev 13, 17\u002618 The beast, Babylon appear. Rev 19 the rider on the white horse appears to wage war. This mirrors Daniel 7.\n12. Not all nations or people of every language worshiped Jesus His first coming. He was only sent to the lost sheep of Israel, Mt 15:24. Only after Pentecost did the gospel get preached to Gentiles, Acts 10:27-37.\n13. Acts 1:9-11 Jesus went up into Heaven with His resurrected body. That same Jesus will come back in the same way, with His resurrected body.\n14. Mt 24:20-21 imply that the Sabbath should be kept even on the Last Day. Then Mt 24:22-26 \u0022don\u0027t believe people who say \u0022here He is\u0022 must also apply to us on the last days too. \n15. \u0022Green Book\u0022 chapter 15 page 109 and chapter 11 page 74 contradict. Ahnsahnghong says Isa 66:15-16 is about God coming in the flesh that we can see, then later says it is about God coming with fire that we can\u0027t see. Which one is it?\n16. \u0022Green Book\u0022 chapter 16 page 11. Ahnsahnghong said the gospel will be preached to the WHOLE world in 37 years. This did not happen.\n17. 1948 \u002B 37= 1985 (X), 1964 \u002B 37= 2001 (X) and 1985 \u002B 37= 2022 (X).\n18. Second coming has not happened yet, when it does you will not miss it.\n\n**Works Cited**\nhttps://biblehub.com/greek/nephelo_n_3507.htm\nhttps://www.biblegateway.com/\nhttps://ncpcog.church/foriginalbooks/\nhttps://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=godhoom1\u0026logNo=220018323695\u0026navType=by (1999 Publication)\n\n**Time Stamp**\n0:00 Intro\n0:59 Subject Begins\n1:09 2nd Coming and Judgement Breakdown\n3:19 \u0022Divine Principle\u0022 written by Moon about coming on the clouds.\n4:17 The verses about \u0022clouds\u0022.

      "title": "WMSCOG\u0027s King David Prophecy Debunked The Shocking Truth Revealed",
      "description": "**Grab Your Bibles** It will be much easier to follow along\n\nBrief Summary of Contents:\n1. The book title \u0022God in the flesh\u0022 published in 1977 contains the same teaching about King David as the WMSCOG\n2. \u0022Mystery of God and the Spring of the Water of Life\u0022 chapter 21 (original) or chapter 19 (altered version) written in 1980 by Christ Ahnsahnghong mirrors the book \u0022God in the flesh\u0022.\n3. The Apostles considered their timeframe the \u0022last days\u0022. Acts 2:14-17, Hebrews 1:2 and 1 John 2:18.\n4. Hosea 3:5 is fulfilled by Jesus at His first coming.\n5. Jesus reigns and upholds the throne FOREVER. Not 3 years or 37 years. Isaiah 9:6-7, Luke 1:31-33\n6. Jesus began His ministry at the age of 30, most likely because it was customary at the time for Rabbi\u0027s or teachers to begin public ministry at 30.\n7. If Jesus appears in secret (Hebrews 9:28) then who are those \u0022waiting for him\u0022? How can you wait for someone you don\u0027t know you should be expecting or if you don\u0027t know they exist?\n8. Christ only dies ONCE. Romans 6:8-10 \u0026 Hebrews 9:25-28\n10. The Covenant God made with David is the THRONE and LINEAGE of David. Psalm 89:3-4, 24-29 \u0026 35-37\n11. There is NO proof in the Bible that King David kept the Passover.\n12. The Everlasting Covenant made in Isaiah 55 is made with Israel not David. \n13. The sign of the Everlasting Covenant (Isa 55:3) is \u0022is instead of thornbush you will have juniper and instead of briers you will have myrtle\u0022. What does that have to do with Passover?\n14. The Everlasting Covenant is the blood of Jesus, not bread and wine.\n15. The bread and wine is a REPRESENTATION of Jesus sacrifice.\n16. If the ETERNAL Covenant is the Passover that the WMSCOG teaches. Then why was it ABOLISHED? \n17. Jesus baptism that He had to undergo is referring to His suffering on the cross. Not a secret water baptism in 1948.\n19. Baptism can be symbolic and is not always literal. Romans 6:2-4 \u0026 Acts 1:5\n20. Christ Ahnsahnghong consider his 37 ministry started 1951 not 1948.\n21. He taught that he would ascend alive with the 144,000 in 1988.\n22. He consider himself Elijah that was preparing the way for Second Coming Jesus.\n23. Jesus said \u0022it is finished\u0022. Meaning He had accomplished everything He originally came to earth to accomplish.\n\n**Time Stamp**\n0:00 Intro\n0:45 Teaching Break Down\n4:08 Origin\n5:54 the \u0022last days\u0022\n6:50 The length of Jesus Reign\n13:22 How long is Jesus ministry?\n15:20 Isaiah 55 verse 3 biblical analysis\n18:03 NO biblical evidence that King David kept the Passover\n19:05 The Covenant God made with David\n20:44 what is the Everlasting Covenant?\n23:44 the baptism Jesus said He still had to undergo\n28:40 The ARTICLE published in 1981\n\n**Works Cited**\nhttps://www.biblegateway.com/\nhttps://ncpcog.church/foriginalbooks/\nhttps://biblehub.com/greek/165.htm\nhttps://biblehub.com/hebrew/olam_5769.htm\nhttps://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=godhoom1\u0026logNo=221941562610\u0026navType=by\n\nThe views and opinions expressed on this channel are solely those of the narrator and or guests.

      "description": "**Grab Your Bibles** It will make it easier to follow.\n\nSummarization of Content:\n1. The Teaching of Regarding 3 ages and the name of the savior in each age. (Age of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit)\n2. Ahnsahnghong taught that we are saved in the name Jesus both in the age of the son and in the last days.\n3. The name Jehovah is Latin for \u0022YHWH\u0022 appearing first in the Dark Ages.\n4. God has many names in the Old Testament.\n5. \u0022Jesus\u0022 is Latin from the Greek \u0022lesous\u0022 which is comes from the Hebrew \u0022Yeshuah or Yehoshuah\u0022 which is all throughout the Old Testament.\n6. \u0022Jesus\u0022 also did not appear until around the 16th century.\n7. Wouldn\u0027t it make sense to be baptized in the original Hebrew names of God the Father and the Son, just like we have to use Ahnsahnghong?\n8. Matthew 28:19 \u0022name\u0022 or Greek \u0022onoma\u0022 means authority of.\n9. The New Name (Rev 2:17) is given AFTER overcoming, not before.\n10. The New Name (Rev 2:17) is given to someone that only THEY will know. So it is NOT a name that many will know, like Ahnsahnghong.\n11. The New Name should appear in the Church of Pergamum (313-538ad) according to the 7 Churches Prophecy.\n12. We too are regarded as living stones 1 Peter 2:5\n13. God has given \u0022new names\u0022 to many of His people. Abram - Abraham, Jacob - Israel, Simon - Peter and Saul to Paul.\n14.  The New Name (Father), New Jerusalem (Mother) (Rev 3:12) should appear in the Church in Philadelphia (1798-1844).\n15. If names are important than why do you not pray in Mother\u0027s name, but instead you pray to her TITLE?\n16. \u0022Vicarius Filii Dei\u0022 is described as a name (Rev 13), but WMSCOG uses it as the title of the Pope. \n17. WMSCOG uses the names \u0022Jehovah\u0022 and \u0022Jesus\u0022 in baptism which are from Latin, the same language that gives you 666 aka Mark of the Beast.\n18. We are being built into a spiritual dwelling, as in currently. In Revelation 3 it describes that we are permanent fixtures that will never leave.\n19. Revelation 19 describes Jesus has having multiple names: Faithful, True, Word of God, King of Kinds and Lord of Lords.\n20. The New Name in Revelation 2 and Christ\u0027s New Name in Revelation 3 are spiritual gifts given to God\u0027s people for overcoming.\n\n**Works Cited**\nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/Yahweh\nhttps://www.gotquestions.org/YHWH-tetragrammaton.html\nhttps://www.gotquestions.org/Modalistic-Monarchianism.html\nhttps://biblehub.com/text/psalms/116-4.htm\nhttps://biblehub.com/hebrew/3444.htm\nhttps://biblehub.com/greek/3686.htm\nhttps://www.biblegateway.com/\n\n**Time Stamp**\n0:00 Intro.\n0:50 WMSCOG breakdown regarding the New Name.\n4:30 Ahnsahnghong taught Jesus was the only name to be saved in.\n6:58 The origin of the name \u0022Jehovah\u0022.\n9:04 The many names of God in the Old Testament.\n10:35 The origin of the name \u0022Jesus\u0022.\n12:42 Matthew 28:19 Biblical Analysis.\n14:40 The Greek meaning of \u0022name\u0022 in Matthew 28:19.\n15:35 \u0022New Name\u0022 in Revelation 2:17 Biblical Analysis.\n18:55 God has given people \u0022new names\u0022 before.\n19:34 The \u0022New Name\u0022 should appear in 313-538 ad.\n20:12 Christ\u0027s \u0022New Name\u0022 in Revelation 3:11-12 Biblical Analysis\n21:33 New Jerusalem (God the Mother) should appear in 1798-1844 ad.\n22:40 We are BEING BUILT, not have been built.\n24:25 The many \u0022names\u0022 of Christ in Revelation 19:11-16.\n25:36 Conclusion.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed on this channel are solely those of the narrator and or guests.

      "title": "Is Ahnsahnghong the Root of David? A Biblical Analysis",
      "description": "**Grab Your Bibles** It will be a lot easier to follow along.\n\nIn this video, we delve into a biblical analysis to determine if Ahnsahnghong is truly the Root of David. Join us as we explore the teachings of the World Mission Society Church of God and hear testimonies from a former member.\n\nBrief Summary of Contents:\n\n1. Rev Sun Myung Moon wrote about the lost truth being restored in 1951 \u0022Divine Principle\u0022.\n2. The sealed scroll, the Root of David and the Lamb are in Heaven, not on earth.\n3. 6 of the seals are opened \u0022Great Tribulation\u0022 happens before the Angel from the East arrives.\n4. 6 seals are the \u0022Great Tribulation\u0022 that the \u0022great multitude\u0022 come out of.\n5. The \u0022great multitude\u0022 have washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb, aka kept the Passover.\n6. How could the \u0022great multitude\u0022 have kept Passover if they died before the Passover is restored.\n7. Only the 144,000 are sealed, since the \u0022great multitude\u0022 are deceased before Seal of God comes.\n8. If Ahnsahnghong is the Root of David and he fulfilled prophecy. Then why are there 3 chapters missing from his books? Why are there so many additions and changes to the books we do have? Why can\u0027t we read all of his books for ourselves?\n9. It appears to me that even the WMSCOG doesn\u0027t believe their own prophecy of Ahnsahnghong being the Root of David, otherwise they should allow all his material to be read by the members since the pages contain his burning tears for us.\n\nSince the beginning of reformation groups there has always been a certain figure or chosen one at the forefront. This person is considered the only one who can restore the lost truth and everyone else stands condemned if they don\u0027t follow the movement. Here are a few examples.\n\nSDA\u0027s has Ellen White, JW\u0027s has Charles Taze Russell, LDS has Joseph Smith Jr, Unification Church has Sun Myung Moon, Shincheonji has Lee Man Hee, Scientology has L Ron Hubbard, Olive Tree has Park Tae Sun, WMSCOG and NCPCOG has Ahnsahnghong and the list goes on and on.\n\nToday we are examining the WMSCOG\u0027s claim that Ahnsahnghong fulfilled the prophecy of the Root of David who opens the scroll sealed with seven seals in Revelation chapter 5. \n\nThey teach that the fulfillment is Ahnsahnghong who is God who comes in the flesh from the east and he is the only one who is able to understand the bible, reveal its secrets and restored the lost truth of the early church. All who reject his teaching are condemned for eternity.\n\nIf this prophecy is indeed fulfilled as the WMSCOG claims, then it means we should acknowledge it as such. But if it is not, then we need to acknowledge that too, instead of just insisting on our own thoughts or doctrine.\n\n**REMINDER** if you are new to the channel, please watch the intro video first, it explains a lot, then come back to this video.\n\nTime Stamp:\n0:00 Beginning\n0:14 Introduction\n0:51 The Breakdown of the WMSCOG teaching of Root of David\n2:45 \u0022Divine Principle\u0022 written in 1951 by Sun Myung Moon\n5:31 \u0022Mystery of God and the Spring of the Water of Life\u0022 written in 1980 by Ahnsahnghong.\n7:42 Revelation Chapter 5 verses 1 to 14 analysis\n10:36 Isaiah Chapter 29 verses 1 to 12 analysis\n13:57 Revelation Chapter 6 verses 1 to 17 analysis\n19:24 Revelation Chapter 7 verses 1 to 14 analysis\n23:01 Conclusion\n\nThe views and opinions expressed on this channel are solely those of the narrator and or guests.

      "description": "My name is Adam and I got involved with the WMSCOG at 19. I was in for nearly a decade and was in both a main church and house church until I left in 2024.\n\nI started this channel to examine if the doctrines they teach hold up to what the bible says and if they are indeed factual or even original. If at the end of all this you still want to continue in the WMSCOG, then that is your God given right. You also have the right to know all the information, not just what THEY want you to know. Especially if you will devote your life to THEM.\n\nMy goal is NOT to hurt anyone or make someone doubt their faith. Some may call this slander or misinformation but I would argue that the real slander or misinformation is from the organizations themselves that have stolen minds, lives, money and souls. \n\nLastly, my goal is to do my best to give you all the information so that you can decide for YOURSELF what is right for YOU. May God bless you and lead you into truth, and that the truth may set you free.\n\nIn this video, I share my personal experience of why I left WMSCOG after almost a decade. If you\u0027re a former member or curious about this church, this message is for you. Hear my story and perspective on the World Mission Society Church of God.\n\nTime Stamp:\n0:00 Beginning\n0:25 Intro\n0:40 Interesting Comments You NEED To SEE\n3:48 Lawsuits Regarding WMSCOG\n4:13 The 5 Groups Of People Who Will Watch This Video\n6:42 Let The Rambling Begin\n8:12 Did This Happen To You?\n10:07 A Challenge For The WMSCOG\n10:42 Message To Those On The Fence About Leaving WMSCOG\n11:50 Who Would You Follow, Honestly?\n13:04 Many Groups Consider Internet The TOK\n 13:31 Are Ahnsahnghong\u0027s Original Books Available Online the TOK?\n15:27 What To Expect From The Channel\n\nThe views and opinions expressed on this channel are solely those of the narrator and or guests.
