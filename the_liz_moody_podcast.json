      "description": "One Tree Hill star Bethany Joy Lenz knows a lot about cults \u2013 from personal and professional experience. While she stared in a show about cults, Bethany found herself in the Big House Family church covenant, a bible study group-turned-cult that isolated her from her family and peers. Joining a cult is much easier than you might think, and incredibly smart people join cults often. According to Bethany, cults like the one she joined prey on your desire for community, approval, and deep conversation. They use these desires as tools to isolate. But any narcissist will use the same tools, so it\u2019s important to recognize them at work, in family, and in relationships. Hear Bethany\u2019s journey to recovery in her faith and relationships, and learn how she redefined her life. 05:06 Craving Approval From Others 07:24 When Community Becomes A Cult 12:57 Isolation and Rebuilding Relationships 18:31 How Narcissists Gain Your Respect 22:13 Us vs. Them Mentality 26:35 Learning How To Apologize 29:33 Relearning Relationships 33:08 Brutal Honesty For more from Joy, follow her at @msbethanyjoylenz or her podcast, Drama Queens, at @dramaqueensoth .
