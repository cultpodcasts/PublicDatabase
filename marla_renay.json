      "description": "In this video, I share my personal and deeply unique experience of CSA within the Jehovah\u2019s Witness organization\u2014a story that doesn\u0027t fit the typical narratives you\u0027ve heard. This isn\u0027t just about the trauma, but about the silence, the subtle control, and the emotional isolation I lived through. If you\u0027ve felt like your experience didn\u2019t \u0022fit the mold,\u0022 this video is for you. I hope by speaking out, I can help others feel seen and begin to heal.\n\n#ReligiousTrauma\n#ExJW\n#CSAawareness\n#SurvivorVoices\n#JehovahsWitnesses\n#ChurchAbuse\n#SpiritualAbuse\n#SpeakYourTruth\n#CultSurvivor\n#BreakingTheSilence\n#HealingFromAbuse\n#ExJWCommunity\n#SilentNoMore\n#MyStoryMatters\n#TraumaRecovery",

      "description": "In this video, I continue sharing my experience growing up as a Jehovah\u2019s Witness\u2014this time focusing on the deep isolation and loneliness that came with it. From strict rules about friendships to the constant fear of disappointing the congregation, I felt trapped in a world where I could never truly be myself. If you\u2019ve ever felt alone in your faith or struggled with leaving a high-control religion, you\u2019re not alone.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and experiences in the comments. Let\u2019s support each other!\n\n#exjw #jehovahswitness #highcontrolreligion #religioustrauma",
