      "description": "In this video, I continue sharing my experience growing up as a Jehovah\u2019s Witness\u2014this time focusing on the deep isolation and loneliness that came with it. From strict rules about friendships to the constant fear of disappointing the congregation, I felt trapped in a world where I could never truly be myself. If you\u2019ve ever felt alone in your faith or struggled with leaving a high-control religion, you\u2019re not alone.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and experiences in the comments. Let\u2019s support each other!\n\n#exjw #jehovahswitness #highcontrolreligion #religioustrauma",

In this video, I talk about what it was really like\u2014how it shaped me, the struggles I went through, and why I finally had to walk away.
