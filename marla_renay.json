      "description": "Hey everyone!\nIn today\u2019s video, I\u2019m breaking down how Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses match up with the BITE Model \u2014 which stands for Behavior, Information, Thought, and Emotional control \u2014 and why a lot of people (including me) see them as a cult.\n\nI\u2019ll be sharing real quotes straight from their publications and showing screenshots to back it all up. This isn\u2019t about hate \u2014 it\u2019s about talking honestly about control and helping people see what\u2019s really going on.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever been part of the JWs, or you\u2019re just curious about how groups like this work, this one\u2019s for you.\n\nThanks for watching \u2014 don\u2019t forget to like, comment, and subscribe if this helped you!\n\n(And if you\u2019ve got your own experience with the JWs or cult-like groups, feel free to share below. You\u0027re not alone.)\n\n#JehovahsWitnesses #BITEModel #CultAwareness #ReligiousTrauma #ExJW #FreedomOfMind #StevenHassan #ExposingCults #JWAwareness #CultSurvivor #MindControl #JWStories #LeavingACult #ReligiousRecovery",

      "description": "In this video, I share my personal and deeply unique experience of CSA within the Jehovah\u2019s Witness organization\u2014a story that doesn\u0027t fit the typical narratives you\u0027ve heard. This isn\u0027t just about the trauma, but about the silence, the subtle control, and the emotional isolation I lived through. If you\u0027ve felt like your experience didn\u2019t \u0022fit the mold,\u0022 this video is for you. I hope by speaking out, I can help others feel seen and begin to heal.\n\n#ReligiousTrauma\n#ExJW\n#CSAawareness\n#SurvivorVoices\n#JehovahsWitnesses\n#ChurchAbuse\n#SpiritualAbuse\n#SpeakYourTruth\n#CultSurvivor\n#BreakingTheSilence\n#HealingFromAbuse\n#ExJWCommunity\n#SilentNoMore\n#MyStoryMatters\n#TraumaRecovery",

From strict rules about friendships to the constant fear of disappointing the congregation, I felt trapped in a world where I could never truly be myself. If you\u2019ve ever felt alone in your faith or struggled with leaving a high-control religion, you\u2019re not alone.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and experiences in the comments.
