      "description": "Self: In his book \u201CNo Bad Parts\u201D, Dr, Schwartz reveals that just under the surface of these wounded parts is a Self which cannot be hurt, knows how to heal both internally and externally, and has characteristics which represent the highest and best of what we can become as human beings. He refers to these traits as the 8 C\u2019s of self-leadership, and I would like to touch on each of these today. As we walk through these traits, I will give some examples from my own healing journey to help illustrate how these characteristics can help us heal our relationship with our Self so that we can then have healthier external relationships as well. Remember that the Midlife Revolution is all about small changes, so I\u2019m not asking anyone to absorb and practice all 8 of these at once. My hope is that you will pick one that resonates with you and feels safe to try. Feel free to save and share this episode so that you can come back to it when you\u2019re ready to try the next one.
