The Australian Post-Mormon Community claims the institution engages in deceptive recruitment, amasses staggering wealth through mandatory tithing, and lacks financial transparency. \n\nThe submission details alleged harms, including the abusive missionary system and intrusive private interviews with children and youth. Former members, prepared to offer oral testimony, urge the Victorian government to implement sweeping legal reforms and create a regulatory body to curb the institutional power and abuses.\n\nWant to create live streams like this?

Oaks from October 2019. This discussion centers on his views on women\u0027s roles and the church\u0027s stance towards the LGBTQ community, highlighting the gap between the church\u0027s inclusive rhetoric and its exclusionary policies.\nListen as I dissect the implications of these teachings on personal lives, especially for women over 40 who are reevaluating their faith and seeking authenticity in their spiritual journey.\nLearn how small, positive changes can lead to profound life improvements, using my own experience as a testament to the power of personal revolution at midlife.\nExplore the dissonance between \u0027all are welcome\u0027 statements and the reality of church policies that bar full participation for the LGBTQ community.\nThis episode is not just about critique; it\u0027s a beacon for those navigating their way out of high control environments, whether religious, familial, or otherwise.

She survived DV at the hands of an abusive husband, and has spent the last 6 years speaking about her experiences and helping her 400,000 followers. Because she is an outspoken feminist, atheist and anti-MAGA critic, she is constantly bullied and harassed online for the content she creates. Last week, she made the difficult decision to step away from social media because the Harassment was negatively affecting her mental health. \n\nAFTER she made the decision to stop creating content, the women of the YouTube channel @wardradio did an episode supposedly exposing Jennie, saying that she has lied about her ab*se, and inviting her ab*sive ex husband to come on the show to talk about what it\u0027s like to be married to a crazy person.  (Please DO NOT harass these creators). The following day, Ward Radio did a SECOND episode trashing Jennie. This podcast claims to be christian and representative of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (LDS, or Mormon). I\u0027m calling for these creators to practice what they preach. \n\nHere are the resources Jennie Recommends for other DV survivors: \n\nFor help with finances to prevent the abuse that happened to me as a result of financial dependency on Jake, please follow my forensic accountant friend on her channel for incredible tips from an expert who KNOWS: https://www.tiktok.com/@divorcemoneyguide?_t=ZT-8wZEYZwLB3m\u0026_r=1\n\nFor help with parenting plans, protecting yourself during a divorce, and other invaluable help I refer all my followers and private clients to Coach Sam for one on one coaching as well as her blog, free newsletter, and tik tok livestreams:\nsamanthaboss.com\n\nI 10/10 recommend attorney Billie Tarascio of Modern Law\u2019s \u201CWin without Law School\u201D program.

After his departure, Jonathan faced severe addiction and sought rehab treatment. His story takes an unexpected turn when he recognizes the manipulation techniques he learned within the church affecting his personal relationships.\u00A0\nDiscover how Jonathan\u0027s self-awareness led him to acknowledge his narcissistic tendencies, developed as a shield against shame, and how this realization ultimately cost him a significant relationship. Now, Jonathan is on a mission to educate and heal, particularly focusing on how men can better understand and respect women\u0027s perspectives within and beyond the church.\nIn this candid conversation, Jonathan also reflects on his relationship with his father, a faithful LDS member, who despite following the church\u0027s guidelines, passed away unfulfilled.

He refers to these traits as the 8 C\u2019s of self-leadership, and I would like to touch on each of these today. As we walk through these traits, I will give some examples from my own healing journey to help illustrate how these characteristics can help us heal our relationship with our Self so that we can then have healthier external relationships as well. Remember that the Midlife Revolution is all about small changes, so I\u2019m not asking anyone to absorb and practice all 8 of these at once. My hope is that you will pick one that resonates with you and feels safe to try. Feel free to save and share this episode so that you can come back to it when you\u2019re ready to try the next one.
