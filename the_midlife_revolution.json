      "description": "Dive into an eye-opening interview with Jonathan, who shares his transformative journey from being a lifelong member of the LDS Church to navigating the complex aftermath of leaving. After his departure, Jonathan faced severe addiction and sought rehab treatment. His story takes an unexpected turn when he recognizes the manipulation techniques he learned within the church affecting his personal relationships.\u00A0\nDiscover how Jonathan\u0027s self-awareness led him to acknowledge his narcissistic tendencies, developed as a shield against shame, and how this realization ultimately cost him a significant relationship. Now, Jonathan is on a mission to educate and heal, particularly focusing on how men can better understand and respect women\u0027s perspectives within and beyond the church.\nIn this candid conversation, Jonathan also reflects on his relationship with his father, a faithful LDS member, who despite following the church\u0027s guidelines, passed away unfulfilled. This video is not just Jonathan\u0027s story; it\u0027s a call to action for empathy, understanding, and personal growth.\nLDS Church exit story\nMormon church manipulation\nNarcissism recovery\nAddiction recovery story\nRelationship after church\nUnderstanding women\u0027s perspective\nLDS and personal growth\nHealing from religious trauma\nSelf-awareness journey\nTherapy for narcissism\n#LDSJourney\n#NarcissismRecovery\n#UnderstandingWomen",

He refers to these traits as the 8 C\u2019s of self-leadership, and I would like to touch on each of these today. As we walk through these traits, I will give some examples from my own healing journey to help illustrate how these characteristics can help us heal our relationship with our Self so that we can then have healthier external relationships as well. Remember that the Midlife Revolution is all about small changes, so I\u2019m not asking anyone to absorb and practice all 8 of these at once. My hope is that you will pick one that resonates with you and feels safe to try. Feel free to save and share this episode so that you can come back to it when you\u2019re ready to try the next one.
