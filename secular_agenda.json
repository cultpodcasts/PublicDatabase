      "description": "This episode highlights a new parliamentary inquiry in Victoria examining cults and organised fringe groups, \u00A0the methods used to recruit and control their members, and the impacts of coercive control. The episode features an interview with Lara Kaput (02:10), a former member of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses who became a whistleblower. For a number of years, Lara dedicated herself to advocacy work with the group known as Say Sorry. She has recently stepped down from Say Sorry but continues to advocate for governments to address abuses in cult groups.\nThe Legislative Assembly Legal and Social Issues Committee\u2019s inquiry is currently open for submissions, closing at the end of July 2025. Submissions can be made via the committee\u0027s website. Visit it here.\nThe Rationalist Society of Australia is advocating for states and territories to extend coercive control laws to cover cults and high-demand religious groups. Follow our campaign here.\nIn early April this year, The Age featured a report by Richard Baker about the establishment of the committee inquiry. Read here.\nIn May, SBS featured a report by Aleisha Orr about the inquiry and included comments from a support group for ex-cult members about its hopes that the inquiry will raise awareness about harms and drive change. Read here.\nIn May, the Australian Christian Lobby\u2019s Michelle Pearse warned that the Victorian parliamentary committee inquiry into cults and their coercive practices could impact the \u201CChristian church\u201D and restrict freedom of religion.
