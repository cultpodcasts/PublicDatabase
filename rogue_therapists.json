      "description": "Hey! We\u2019re your Rogue Therapists. Thanks for joining us to talk about all things psychology, pop culture, and the prime of our lives. \n\uD83D\uDC96 Remember, this isn\u2019t clinical advice! We may be therapists, but we\u2019re not your therapists. \n\uD83E\uDEA9 This is meant for entertainment and psychoeducation, and if you are in need of support, we recommend finding someone local to you. \n\uD83D\uDDEF\uFE0F We believe in the power of sharing your personal experiences, and know that true healing is best done when you are able to be your most authentic self.\n\uD83C\uDFF3\uFE0F\u200D\uD83C\uDF08\uD83C\uDFF3\uFE0F\u200D\u26A7\uFE0F While we come from positions of power and privilege, we want to acknowledge that and amplify the voices and stories of others around us. This is a safe space, affirming for all, regardless of how you identify and what you believe.\n\uD83D\uDCAD Have something you want to say? Let us know! We\u2019re accepting questions, comments and interview requests at our email address and social media accounts, listed below.\n\uD83D\uDC8C ROGUETHERAPISTS@GMAIL.COM\n\uD83E\uDD0D TIKTOK: @ROGUETHERAPISTS\n\uD83D\uDDE3\uFE0F YOUTUBE: @ROGUETHERAPISTS\n\uD83D\uDC6F\u200D\u2640\uFE0F INSTAGRAM: @ROGUETHERAPISTSPOD",
