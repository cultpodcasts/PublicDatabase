Lisa emphasizes the importance of self-love and the ongoing nature of recovery, highlighting that it\u0027s never too late to change and grow. Lisa Kohn grew up in the Unification Church, known as the Moonies. Her childhood was marked by a stark contrast between her mother\u0027s cult and her father\u0027s lifestyle. Kohn\u0027s mother joined the cult when she was 10, leading to a tumultuous family dynamic. She often felt terrified and clung to her mother for security. Ultimately, she believes in the importance of self-acceptance and understanding that others\u0027 opinions are not her responsibility. Codependency is a deeply ingrained issue that can affect relationships. Cult upbringing can lead to significant mental health challenges. Realizing the impact of past experiences is a continuous journey. The struggle for identity often stems from childhood experiences in a cult.

Ryan shares his deeply personal story of resilience after facing unimaginable challenges, including the shocking revelation of his father\u0027s predatory behavior as a pastor.\nWhat would you do if you learned from a podcast that your dad\u2014a pastor\u2014was a serial sexual abuser? For Ryan, this wasn\u2019t a hypothetical scenario; it was a painful reality that forced him to confront the faces behind the stories he had heard. As he delved into the dysfunction and abuse within the cult of his youth, Ryan recognized that such predatory behavior was often woven into the very fabric of his former faith.\nRather than allowing this trauma to destroy his spirit, Ryan found solace in a different understanding of Jesus\u2014one that is tender and redemptive. In his new book, *Hurt and Healed by the Church*, he recounts how he separated his faith from the harmful doctrines of American fundamentalism. Through candid reflections, Ryan illustrates the mental shifts and restorative relationships that guided him toward healing from church trauma and spiritual manipulation.\nIf you\u0027ve experienced church hurt or are grappling with your faith in light of past abuse, Ryan\u2019s insights offer a path to rebuild your faith without feeling like you\u2019re abandoning it. His story serves as a beacon of hope and inspiration, demonstrating that unorthodox redemption is possible.\nKey Takeaways:\n- Understanding the reality of abuse within religious institutions\n- The journey of separating faith from harmful beliefs\n- Finding healing and restoration after church trauma\n- The importance of community and supportive relationships in recovery\n- How rebuilding faith can lead to a more compassionate and loving understanding of spirituality\nResources Mentioned:\n- Ryan George\u2019s new book: *Hurt and Healed by the Church*\nSee Book Here\nFind out more about Ryan Here\nConnect with Us:\n- Follow \u3030\uFE0F\u3030\uFE0FShanny \uD83D\uDC56\u3030\uFE0F\u3030\uFE0F\nYouTube\nFacebook\nInstagram\nTikTok\nwww.ShannyPantsShow.com-\nSubscribe to our podcast for more stories of hope and healing\nCall to Action:\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with similar experiences, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out for support.

If you were a part of my cult/group, you will see lots of similarities in Cait\u0027s story. From Cait:When I left home at the age of twenty-five, I had no idea what my path would look like. I had no story to tell. I had spent my entire life in the Christian Patriarchy and Stay-at-Home-Daughter Movements, only to realize that I didn\u2019t belong. My story had always been written for me, and now I was taking over the pen for the first time.In the words of Maya Angelou, \u201CThere is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.\u201DI used to think I could rewrite my whole life, come clean somehow, and pretend I never had a past of oppression and abuse. I didn\u2019t want to be the victim, the pitied, the weak. But the years have taught me that there is no easy way to delete bitter memories or old scars. I can\u2019t separate the good from the bad. So, I\u2019m moving forward, not chained to the past, but liberated from it, carrying with me the old stories, if only as a preface to the new.After I got out, I studied creative writing and publishing at Michigan State University and served on the editorial team for Fourth Genre: Explorations in Nonfiction. My work has been featured in 3288 Review, Dunes Review, Fourth Genre, Hawai\u0060i Pacific Review, The Revealer, and Religion Dispatches.I work full time as a book editor, and I also serve on the editorial board for Tears of Eden, a nonprofit providing resources for survivors of spiritual abuse, and cohost the podcast Survivors Discuss.My debut memoir, Rift: A Memoir of Breaking Away from Christian Patriarchy, will be available on April 30, 2024.www.caitwest.com\u3030\uFE0F\u3030\uFE0FShanny \uD83D\uDC56\u3030\uFE0F\u3030\uFE0FYouTubeFacebookInstagramTikTokwww.ShannyPantsShow.com Hosted on Acast.

Growing up the eldest daughter in a controlling and abusive household, she performed with her family band, The Willis Clan, until her departure in 2016 at the age of 23. Her first book, Unspeakable, narrates her harrowing struggle to both articulate her childhood experience and find her true voice on the other side of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. A passionate advocate for survivors, Jessica lives in Nashville, TN.UNSPEAKABLE:Surviving My Childhood and Finding My VoiceBrought up under the strange philosophies of her\u00A0controlling father, young Jessica Willis was curious\u00A0about the outside world. She wondered if other girls\u00A0were forbidden to disagree with their elders. If\u00A0other mothers feared their husbands. If other\u00A0daddies came into their daughters\u2019 bedrooms at\u00A0night. In\u00A0Unspeakable, her debut memoir, Jessica\u00A0Willis Fisher gives a lacerating portrait of a girl\u00A0who was famous yet unknown, dreaming of\u00A0freedom and terrified of finding it. Stunning in its\u00A0detailed, poetic prose, Unspeakable takes us on a\u00A0journey through a chaotic and crowded childhood,\u00A0first kisses and first love, an electrifying court case\u00A0that brings new losses to the surface, and a\u00A0tumultuous journey of a faith so different from the\u00A0one Jessica first knew.WebsiteYOUTUBE\u3030\uFE0F\u3030\uFE0FShanny \uD83D\uDC56\u3030\uFE0F\u3030\uFE0FLinkTreeTikTokYouTube\u00A0www.ShannyPantsShow.com Hosted on Acast.

Mike shares how he joined the cult and the challenges he faced within it, including the amplification of destructive behavior and struggles with love, value, and acceptance. He discusses his journey of anger and healing, including his experience with therapy and the importance of community in the recovery process. Mike also talks about writing a book on cult recovery and offers advice for those still in the cult.TakeawaysJoining a cult can lead to amplified destructive behavior and struggles with love, value, and acceptance.Recovery from cult experiences may require addressing anger and seeking healing through therapy and community support.Writing and sharing personal stories can help others in their own recovery journeys.It is important to find trusted individuals and communities who can provide support and understanding during the recovery process.As many people begin their quest of seeking God, they all too often can overlook the destructive force of a church or religion that may not be readily visible. These destructive forces can sometimes be overshadowed by the things that are positive about their newly found religious journey. These destructive forces can sometimes come in the form of physical abuse but can oftentimes come through emotional abuse. These disturbances can overpower a person\u0027s life and they can also feel all alone with their religiously oppressive experience. With the author\u0027s own personal experience of being a part of an abusive cult church for 26 years, he offers understanding, hope, healing, and a way through the trauma through a twelve-step process. -CULT CANDYCult Candy-Youtube Links:Introduction\u00A0https://youtu.be/PIhJcggFqa8?si=BNpj33whC-4M8_CzElitismhttps://youtu.be/12fxb3LCsdo?si=JE2nY1iInimL6lIUIsolationismhttps://youtu.be/sGUq43Ovde0?si=Nl7Z2P2CdEgt-2pjTotalismhttps://youtu.be/Th8WNlsprlw?si=Wvr7yqtafQJneN_ULegalismhttps://youtu.be/EBILT1h7ffc?si=H3dg4dR4M8yuwT3DFace Book\u00A0Linkhttps://www.facebook.com/cultcandyinfo\u00A0Contact Mike cult.candi@gmail.com Hosted on Acast.

My story is long and complex which is why I\u2019ve been working on a book. This entry will leave out many details and cover the general overview of my experiences, and help people understand how I got here.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u0022Religious trauma is similar in symptoms to Complex-PTSD. Symptoms of RT\u00A0Negative beliefs about others\u00A0Low self-esteem\u00A0Struggle with emotional regulation\u00A0Depression, anxiety, grief, and anger\u00A0NightmaresDisassociation, flashbacks\u00A0Lack of pleasureFeeling isolated\u00A0Feeling empty, lost, or directionless\u00A0Reduced critical thinking\u00A0Feeling out of place or like you don\u2019t belong\u00A0\u00A0According to Restoration Counseling, Religious Trauma Syndrome is often caused for several reasons by different people. Many people experience RTS as a result of an authoritarian religion or faith community. Individuals suffering from RTS may be struggling with black-and-white thinking, irrational beliefs, difficulty trusting themselves, low self-esteem, or feeling indebted to a group of people. Skewed views of sex, discipline, emotional regulation, relationships, and self-expression are usually present in toxic religious environments\u0022 (Source: Restoration Counseling).- Andrew Pledger(Excerpt taken from https://andrewpledger.mypixieset.com/my-story/)Find AndrewFacebookWebsiteInstagram\u3030\uFE0F\u3030\uFE0FShanny \uD83D\uDC56\u3030\uFE0F\u3030\uFE0FYouTubeInstagramTikTokwww.ShannyPantsShow.com Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "I turned to writing after George, my partner of 32 years, died of cancer in April 2013, and I found myself living alone for the first time at age 50.I needed to know I still existed after a year of being his caregiver, watching him disintegrate, feeling deep in my bones that somehow I was failing him. He was in denial so he thought he was going to recover even as his body abandoned him.I couldn\u2019t fix his illness, not could I jolt him into reality, nor get him to agree to palliative care, nor to involve his parents who were going to lose their only child. I thought I was crawling out of my skin. Through grief therapy, I found out I had post-traumatic stress disorder.Over the next few years, I sort of got better, in dribs and drabs, but the loneliness enveloped me. For 32 years, George and I had eaten dinner together almost every night, then curled up in bed to wake up beside each other each morning. I still wonder, where does all that love go? Is it transmuted into protective energy or is it just gone?I was a practicing attorney for over ten years which lends my writing an acrid tone of bitterness and irony. In an effort to work on that, I also earned an MFA in creative nonfiction from Saint Mary\u2019s College of California in May of 2020.My essays have been published in The New York Times\u2019 \u201CModern Love\u201D column, HuffPost, Woman\u2019s Day, Good Housekeeping, Elle Decor, and Reader\u2019s Digest, among other publications. My award-winning blog,\u00A0debbieweissauthor.com\u00A0dispenses empathy and advice on grief and dating after loss.I\u2019ve been in the California Bay Area since I was six, and currently live in Benicia, CA.

It is absolutely beautiful as I look at his wristband boasting \u002297 yrs\u0022 and think back on how much life he has experienced. It\u0027s been emotional but mostly comforting being here with him. He is ready to see Jesus and many loved ones who are waiting for him. When I interviewed Julie I had no idea that within a few months I would be experiencing so many things she talked about.

      "description": "\u201CMy story is long and life-changing. I was in my senior year of nursing school, 24 years old, when I told my husband, Dalton, I was ready for a baby. We had been married for almost 3 years and I was about to graduate to work in a field I loved; I thought it was the perfect time. Though it was the perfect time in our lives, there were a lot of other factors to play into this journey. I am a\u00A0type-1 diabetic, and PCOS runs in my family. I always knew in the back of my mind I had PCOS due to never having a regular period. With these factors being a part of the journey, I spoke with my endocrinologist who referred me to a specialty OBGYN.I went into my appointment hoping maybe I was already pregnant because I had not had a period that month. Labs were run and an ultrasound was done. I was the furthest from pregnant\u2014I was diagnosed with\u00A0PCOS. With my diagnosis, I was immediately put on Clomid to help with infertility. I was told I ovulated maybe once a year. I thought, \u2018Okay, this will help speed up the process. This will be great!\u2019 I took three doses of Clomid before I got a positive pregnancy test, and then I couldn\u2019t believe it so I took many pregnancy tests. I went in around 9 or 10 weeks pregnant. I thought, \u2018Man, I am huge, there has to be more than one baby in there.\u2019 Oh, was I in for a surprise\u2026Read full story Herehttps://www.lovewhatmatters.com/man-i-am-huge-there-has-to-be-more-than-one-baby-in-here-was-i-in-for-a-surprise-type-1-diabetic-gives-birth-to-quadruplets/\u3030\uFE0F\u3030\uFE0FShanny \uD83D\uDC56\u3030\uFE0F\u3030\uFE0FLinkTreeInstagram\u00A0TikTokYouTube\u00A0Facebook\u00A0www.ShannyPantsShow.com Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "Enjoy my conversation with Mallary Hope where we talk about her beginnings in the music industry and some highlights along the way. We also have some good laughs talking about our families and crazy kiddos. \u0022Mallary Hope is a Georgia-born storyteller who uses music to convey her experiences, and the world around her. At 9-years old, Hope \u2013 aptly named by her mom \u2013 began to understand that music is at the core of her being, as the sweet sound of Karen Carpenter\u2019s voice on The Carpenters\u2019 \u201CSuperstar\u201D brought her to tears. A short couple of years later, Amy Grant\u2019s \u201CEl Shaddai\u201D was the first song she learned to play on the guitar, followed by Dolly Parton\u2019s \u201CCoat of Many Colors.\u201D Mallary\u2019s childhood church provided her the first stage where she was able to share her captivating vocals with others. With supporting parents willing to give their daughter every opportunity they could, they moved the family to Nashville, where it didn\u2019t take long for Hope to meet plenty of supporters in the music industry, and for her to make it to one of the most legendary stages the world over \u2013 the Grand Ole Opry \u2013 where she has performed many times since. \u201CI love Jesus and Johnny Cash,\u201D shares Hope, exemplifying everything about her personal faith she wants to share with the world, along with her deep love and appreciation of music that knows no boundaries. \u201CPeople want to be encouraged. My songs evoke emotion. It is my desire that my songs can bring meaning and clarity to the various things we all go through in our lives.\u201DHope, who has been covered by The New York Times, performed on Fox \u0026 Friends, receives airplay from both Christian and Country radio stations, and whose music videos are supported by CMT, has toured alongside artists as varied as Skillet and Darius Rucker, and has written songs for fellow artists like Lauren Alaina, Danny Gokey, Sara Evans, and Faith Hill. And as for the beginning of one of her life\u2019s dearest and most important relationships, her thoughtful boyfriend (at the time) proposed to her on the stage of the Grand Ole Opry House, in one moment marrying multiple things dearest to Hope: her faith, her (future) husband, and of course, music. From the early and lasting influences of Karen Carpenter to Amy Grant to Dolly Parton, Mallary is using that beautiful voice with forever echoes of her deep American South upbringing, along with her overall inescapable platform of music, to share what inspires her, and encourage others along the way.\u0022 Source: https://www.klove.com/music/artists/mallary-hopeFind more information about Mallary Hopehttps://mallaryhopemusic.com/Mallary on Instagram \u3030\uFE0F\u3030\uFE0FShanny \uD83D\uDC56\u3030\uFE0F\u3030\uFE0FYouTubeFacebookInstagramTikTokwww.ShannyPantsShow.com Hosted on Acast.

They quickly realized the Instagram account was growing faster than the site, due to their ultra close-up shots of tacos, burgers, and cheesy delights, and by 2015 they\u2019d amassed 75,000 followers and changed their name to Devour Power. The following year, Remmey and West began charging brands for content, realized they could turn their foodie hobby into a business, and quit their day jobs to plot the groundwork for Devour Media.

      "description": "Since birth, I have had the unbelievable advantage to be immersed in a very multicultural\u00A0environment. Parents of different nationalities, and moving countries every couple of years\u00A0opened my eyes to the world. I couldn\u2019t wish for a richer life. I learned the art of striking a\u00A0conversation from a very young age, curious about cultures and communities, questioning\u00A0everything and everyone across my path, in what I believe is an attempt to understand\u00A0what guides behaviors and opinions.\u00A0\u200BAs I started building a family of my own, and as a direct reflection of my life choices, I\u00A0found myself settling in the Netherlands.\u00A0\u00A0\u200BBut the urge to meet new people and change surroundings had to be met. That urge\u00A0manifested itself every few years through my longing for new beginnings. I temporarily\u00A0satisfied this urge by moving house. When my family got larger, I changed jobs.\u00A0\u200BWith it, I found myself surrounded by people with fabulous diverse individual stories and\u00A0passionately driven by their personal aspirations.\u00A0\u200BThey are my inspiration.\u00A0\u00A0NagzAbout the PodcastI have always imagined life as a tree.Born from the roots you inherit and raised in a system you experience, there comes a time where you face the necessity of making choices as you grow. At each intersection, you get a number of possible branches to jump on. If you visualize  this, you can see the endless possibilities that lie ahead of you.\u00A0In life though, you discover the strength and abundance of the knots, twigs, branches and leaves, only when you have chosen a path or started your journey.\u00A0\u00A0And you do it with the hope that it will lead you to a place of personal flourishing, closer to blue skies and the warm shining sun.\u00A0\u00A0This podcast series is all about sharing our stories. The failures, the successes, the choices we made and what we want to do next. It\u2019s a means to inspire others and a way to be held accountable.

      "description": "Vanessa and I have a great conversation about her idea to to start the business CHATBOOKS! She has children ranging for the ages 14-27 so she shares how motherhood has been for her and I beg her for all the advice! I need to listen to her advice in this podcast over and over again every day and possibly tattoo it to my forehead.  \u0022We started Chatbooks in 2014 as a small family affair. I didn\u2019t have time to make scrapbooks\u2013or even print photos!\u2013of my seven kids. But I was reminded of how much children love photos of their everyday lives when a preschool teacher gave my youngest son an album of the year. Each night, when I went to tuck him in, he was looking at the photos. I didn\u2019t have time for another project, but I did post photos on Instagram for my family and friends to see. Could I turn those into photo books\u2014automatically? And that\u2019s why my husband, Nate, and I started Chatbooks.\u0022VANESSA QUIGLEY, CO-FOUNDEROur Mission is to Strengthen Families\u201CToday, there are more than 135 of us working at Chatbooks, but we\u2019re never going to let ourselves become a faceless big company\u2014no matter how much we grow, we\u2019re determined to \u201Cstay small.\u201D We hope you\u2019ll think of us the way we think of you: Not as \u0022a company\u0022 and\u00A0\u0022a bunch of customers\u201D\u00A0but as real people and individuals.\u00A0From the part-time, stay-at-home moms and dads all around the country (like Heather in Chicago, Megan in Portland, and Katie in Alaska) who provide customer support, to the hard-working crews in the print shop and our talented software developers, we love building something that matters to you.\u00A0Our team has been thinking a lot about what motivates us, and it comes down to this:Our mission is to strengthen families.This is really important to us and we hope you can sense it in everything we do.

      "description": "I had such a fun time chatting with this amazing artist! I am so fascinated by the music industry and I got a peek into what that looks like for AJ Smith! Go listen to his music, it\u0027s fantastic! My favorite songs of his are NOBODY and FAMOUS!Denver-born, and recently relocated from NYC to Nashville, AJ Smith\u2019s unconventional path to becoming a pop artist is reflected throughout his music, which has the uncanny ability to evoke a nostalgic desire for dramatic pop of decades past while sounding modern, fresh, and in-the-moment emotional.\u00A0A flare for the dramatic is likely written into his DNA - AJ\u2019s father ran away and literally joined the circus (as a promoter who was unafraid to step into the ring or even the \u201CGlobe of Death\u201D for the sake of the show), while his Great Great Uncle was famed Cuban pianist Ernesto Lecuona, who composed the famed standard \u201CMalague\u00F1a\u201D.\u00A0It\u0027s no surprise then, that Smith\u2019s songwriting and performance abilities have earned multiple awards, including the prestigious Abe Olman Scholarship from the Songwriters Hall of Fame and a semi-finalist ranking in the 2020 International Songwriting Contest.\u00A0Recent highlights include making his national TV debut on The Kelly Clarkson show, consistent airplay on SiriusXM, the cover feature as Performer Magazine\u2019s Artist of the Month, collaborating with Martin Guitar\u2019s launch of a new line of ukuleles (which included teaching a SpaceX astronaut how to play a Black Pumas song in space!)...and stories in American Songwriter, Good Morning America, CBS Radio, Spin Magazine, and more.

      "description": "*TRIGGER WARNING* This episode includes subjects of sexual, mental and physical abuse. Join me today as Sarah shares with us her story of escaping NXIVM and exposing the cult leader. Sarah Edmondson is a Canadian actress and playwright who has starred in the CBS series Salvation and more than twelve films for the Hallmark Channel and Lifetime. She is also a well-established voice-over artist for popular series such as Transformers: Cybertron and My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic. In 2005, when NXIVM, a personal and professional development company, promised to provide the tools and insight Sarah needed to reach her potential, she was intrigued. Over her twelve-year tenure, she went from student to coach and eventually operated her own NXIVM center in Vancouver. Questions kept coming up about the organization\u2019s rules and practices, which came to a head in 2017 when she accepted an invitation from her best friend to join DOS, a \u201Csecret sisterhood\u201D within NXIVM.In 2019, Sarah published Scarred: The True Story of How I Escaped NXIVM, the Cult that Bound My Life, with Kristine Gasbarre. In this tell-all memoir, she shares her story from the moment she takes her first seminar to her harrowing fight to get out of NXIVM, collaborate with the FBI, help others, and heal.Sarah\u2019s full story as a whistleblower is featured in the CBC podcast \u201CUncover: Escaping NXIVM\u201D (downloaded over 25 million times) and \u201CThe Vow\u201D, the critically acclaimed HBO documentary series on NXIVM.Now with the launch of her own podcast, \u201CA Little Bit Culty,\u201D Sarah is keeping the conversation going by exploring the fads, beliefs, and trends that blur the line between devotion and dysfunction. Co-hosted by her husband and fellow NXIVM whistleblower Anthony \u201CNippy\u201D Ames, the podcast is part conversational coffee date and part deep dive on everything from Waco to lululemon. And while there was nothing small about Sarah\u2019s cult experience, \u201CA Little Bit Culty\u201D is grounded in her mission to help people understand, heal from, and avoid abusive situations, one little red flag at a time.Find Sarah on IG @sarahedmondson @alittlebitculty @igotout_org Follow the #igotout\u2747\uFE0FGet her book here https://www.sarahedmondson.com/book\u2733\uFE0FCheck out her amazing list of resources https://www.sarahedmondson.com/resources\u2747\uFE0F Listen to her Podcast https://www.alittlebitculty.com/ Hosted on Acast.
