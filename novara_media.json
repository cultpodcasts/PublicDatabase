      "description": "As Artificial Intelligence begins to fundamentally alter the way normal people live their lives, it\u2019s often talked about in terms of boom and doom, which makes a nuanced examination difficult. The problem with AI is that the understanding required to scrutinise the technology is rare and even if one does have that understanding, the ability to clearly communicate it is even rarer. \n\nThis week\u2019s guest has been both a worker in, and reporter on the tech industry and is uniquely poised to present a nuanced and informed analysis of this rapidly expanding industry. In \u2018Empire of AI\u2019, Karen Hao debunks myths that surround AI and exposes us to the full breadth of this global industry, from it\u2019s cult-leader like CEOs to the workers that power the technology. \n\nShe sat down with Aaron to talk about Sam Altman\u2019s origin story, the traumatising nature of content moderation work and the striking similarities between Open AI and the British East India Company.\n\n\n00:00 Intro\n03:11 AI, Deep Learning \u0026 Machine Learning Explained\n09:27 Data Centres \u0026 Resource Consumption\n14:30 Who Are The Major Players\n23:17 What\u2019s Behind Open AI\u2019s Rapid Rise\n32:50 Who Is Sam Altman?\n45:40 Who Is Karen Hao?\n51:49 Colonial Similarities To AI Companies\n01:07:39 DeepSeek\n01:11:49 Exploitative Practices In Global South\n01:22:00 How To Stop Big Tech",
