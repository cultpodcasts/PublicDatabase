These are not the terms that we should have used.  The term used should have been \u0022rape\u0022.  Anyone who understands abuse should immediately recognize the power imbalance Bathsheba would have experienced being summoned and desired by the King - someone in extreme authority you fear saying \u0022no\u0022 to.  David raped Bathsheba.  The prophet Nathan put all of the blame on David, and we never see Bathsheba labeled guilty.\n\nLet me be clear:  Witness Lee\u0027s teaching explicitly threatens you with curses, death, and ruin if you speak up about gross sins of those in the lead, if you speak up about things like rape and murder.  This is not a man of God, this is not \u0022God\u0027s deputy authority\u0022, this is not \u0022the ministry of the age\u0022, and this is NOT the apostles\u0027 teaching.
