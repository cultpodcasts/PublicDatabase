      "description": "In 1969, Charles Manson unleashed his cult of murderous hippies onto the LA Hills. Decades later, it\u2019s a saga that continues to inspire books, movies and memes. But how well do we really know the story that led to seven infamous murders? In Helter Skelter: An American Myth, documentarians Leslie Chilcott and Eli Frankel, deliver the most comprehensive account of the Manson family cult to date. They reveal what really motivated Charles Manson and bring this larger-than-life story back to reality.

      "description": "When Josh Bloch ran into an old friend on Hornby Island, he had no idea what would come next. Sarah had just left a cult called NXIVM and was afraid for her safety. She had spent years under NXIVM\u2019s control, and had been branded with the cult leader\u2019s initials.   Josh brought Sarah\u2019s story to Kathleen, and together they began to dig. What they found was a story of sexual abuse and master manipulation. In this episode, Josh walks us through their original investigation and the elements of the NXIVM story that have yet to be told.
