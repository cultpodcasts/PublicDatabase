He said he should never have believed \u0022the lies\u0022 of Mandelson.\n\nHe says he understands the \u0022anger and frustration\u0022 of Labour MPs. But is he in a position to win back the support of his own party? How close is he to the brink? And - if Mandelson\u0027s relationship with Epstein was widely known at the time of his appointment - what is the PM actually apologising for?\n\nOne of those concerned Labour MPs, Brian Leishman, tells us that Starmer\u0027s chief of staff Morgan McSweeney needs to leave Downing Street, and serious changes need to take place if Starmer is to stay on as Prime Minister.\n\nLater, Emily discusses the infamous Andrew Mountbatten Windsor photo with Virginia Giuffre. It was real after all and the former Prince lied to her when he said he\u0027d never seen it.

And what retribution if any should he now face? Keir Starmer has called for his peerage to be removed.

And what do the 3 million strong Epstein files tell us more widely about who was at the heart of this global power network - where corruption, paedophilia , and cover-up flourished?\n\nSince recording, the SNP and Reform have reported Peter Mandelson to the police over allegations he released confidential government documents to Epstein whilst in public office.
