      "description": "Last night both houses of Congress overwhelmingly voted to force the justice department to release the Epstein files. We could see the contents made public within days. But the vote itself, long resisted by Trump, has left the President looking weaker and more friendless amongst the MAGA base than he\u2019s ever been. Is he starting to look like a lame duck President? And are Republicans imagining a MAGA world that comes after Trump? Or will they quickly revert to fealty? \n\nLater, the college professor in exile from America after being targeted by death threats for his academic work on Antifa.\n\n#trump #usa #uspolitics #epstein #jeffreyepstein #epsteinfiles #epsteinisland #epsteinlist #congress #senate #Podcast #UKPodcast #PoliticsPodcast #News #Politics #NewsAgents #EmilyMaitlis #JonSopel #LewisGoodall\n\nDownload The News Agents with Emily Maitlis, Jon Sopel and Lewis Goodall from 5PM every weekday on Global Player: https://www.globalplayer.com/podcasts/42KuVj/\n\nSubscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/@thenewsagents \nThe News Agents website: https://www.thenewsagents.co.uk/\n\nThe News Agents is a Global Player Original podcast.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConnect with us on the Socials!\nBluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/newsagents.bsky.social\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thenewsagents/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thenewsagents\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/thenewsagentsofficial\nTwitter: https://x.com/TheNewsAgents\nShop our merch: https://store.global.com/collections/the-news-agents?utm_source=YouTube\u0026utm_medium=TNA",

      "description": "Prince Andrew is under unprecedented pressure as Congress weighs whether to FORCE him to testify in the explosive investigation surrounding the Epstein Files. In today\u2019s episode of The News Agents, Emily Maitlis and Jon Sopel speak to Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, who reveals why the committee wants Andrew to appear, how he could be compelled under US law, and what happens if he refuses.\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump has performed a shocking U-turn, now claiming to support releasing the Epstein Files \u2014 despite months spent trying to block the vote. With survivors, families and lawmakers demanding full transparency, Trump faces a veto-proof majority in Congress and a potential political crisis of his own making.\n\nRep. Raja Krishnamoorthi joins us to talk about the Epstein files and the mounting pressure on President Trump.\n\n#princeandrew #royalfamily #kingcharlesiii #kingcharles #trump #jeffreyepstein #epstein #epsteinfiles #epsteinisland #epsteinlist #Podcast #UKPodcast #PoliticsPodcast #News #Politics #NewsAgents #EmilyMaitlis #JonSopel #lewisgoodall \n\nDownload The News Agents with Emily Maitlis, Jon Sopel and Lewis Goodall from 5PM every weekday on Global Player: https://www.globalplayer.com/podcasts/42KuVj/\n\nSubscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/@thenewsagents \nThe News Agents website: https://www.thenewsagents.co.uk/\n\nThe News Agents is a Global Player Original podcast.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConnect with us on the Socials!\nBluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/newsagents.bsky.social\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thenewsagents/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thenewsagents\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/thenewsagentsofficial\nTwitter: https://x.com/TheNewsAgents\nShop our merch: https://store.global.com/collections/the-news-agents?utm_source=YouTube\u0026utm_medium=TNA",
