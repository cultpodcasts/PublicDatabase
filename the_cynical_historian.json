      "description": "I visited the Mormon history museum there.  I found it fascinating, not for revealing anything new to me, since I was already delving deep into Mormon history, but for how they were trying to deal with the various issues of that history.  I expected it to basically be a propaganda center, afterall it is directly run by the church of Latter Day Saints, but they are in-fact a museum and are working within professional standards of interpretation and exhibition.\n\nM.
