      "description": "From the day she was born, Katy Morgan-Davies lived in a cult. Her father led the cult and subjected her and others within the cult to violence and mental abuse. She was not allowed to have any contact with anyone from the outside world, and on the rare occasions she did leave the house, she always had a chaperone. At age 30, she was able to leave.\n\nI spoke to Katy about her time in the cult and also her views on antisemitism. \n\n\nKaty\u0027s book: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Girl-Shadows-My-Life-Cult-ebook/dp/B07KLLM3V8/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1M2K6WMATW09\u0026dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.i0RX80j_Ku-kE1ZST46BfEhJ-IvaxpQViVsmg9IfRbw.yUhZZ3h7Mxc9deNzeVrX9R8qToNxQQ4u7oyh8ry6vRg\u0026dib_tag=se\u0026keywords=katy\u002Bmorgan\u002Bdavies\u0026qid=1752602246\u0026s=books\u0026sprefix=katy\u002Bmorgan\u002Bdavies%2Cstripbooks%2C70\u0026sr=1-1\n\nFind The 286 Project on Social Media: https://linktr.ee/the286project \n\nAbout The 286 Project: A podcast talking about art, politics, culture, sport....and anything else we can think of.",
