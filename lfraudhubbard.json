      "description": "**ORIGNAL FROM\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/doyle6315i **\r\nIn 1971, Paulette Cooper published a book entitled, The Scandal of Scientology; it was a critical expos\u00E9 of the sinister, dangerous, criminal and arcane activities and beliefs of the Church of Scientology.\r\nThe book earned her hostile attention from members of the Cult and they filed a lawsuit against her filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Further lawsuits followed throughout the years, totaling nineteen from all over the world.\r\nThrough the next 15 years, as she continued to expose the Cult, Paulette Cooper was the target not only of litigation but of several harassment campaigns including a Scientology campaign known as OPERATION FREAKOUT, the goal of which was to have Cooper \u0022incarcerated in a mental institution or jail or at least to hit her so hard that she was put under so much stress and anxiety that she was incapable of work.\r\nThe Cult then broke into Coopers home and forged bomb threats using her typewriter and paper with her fingerprints on it. Cooper was arrested by the FBI and charged. She faced a jail sentence of 15 years.\r\nFortunately for Cooper, the Church\u0027s campaign was discovered when the FBI raided Scientology offices in 1977 and recovered documents relating to the operation. The Church finally agreed to an out-of-court settlement with Cooper in 1985 in exchange for her discontinuing her legal actions against Scientology.\r\nThis video is a unique interview with Cooper about her attack by the scientology cult.",
