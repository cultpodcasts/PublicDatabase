      "title": "Journey into the World of Transcendental Meditation - David Wants To Fly (Documentary, 2010)",
      "description": "David Sieveking follows the path of his idol, David Lynch, into the world of transcendental meditation (TM). That leads him to the movement\u2019s founder, Maharishi, the one-time guru of the Beatles. Today, TM is a global conglomerate, promising world peace and yogic flying. How does this chime with the dark films of David Lynch? Inspired by his idol, the young director starts to meditate, too, submerging himself ever deeper in the strange world of TM.\n\n-------\n\nThe unprecedented success story of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi began in the Himalayas. In order to spread his meditation teachings and achieve world peace, the Indian guru came to Hollywood at the end of the 1950s and gained numerous celebrity followers, such as the Beatles, Mia Farrow and Clint Eastwood. Today, almost six million people worldwide practise Transcendental Meditation (TM). David, a young filmmaker in search of inspiration, also wants to try meditation. His idol, the legendary director David Lynch, personally assures him that TM is a source of creativity and the key to success.\n\nDavid decides to take his idol at his word: He undergoes the expensive meditation training, receives his personal mantra and tries his hand at yogic flying. But the inconsistencies soon mount up. The Indian guru\u0027s organization has become an industry worth billions. When Maharishi suddenly dies, there is a dispute over the successor. David Lynch becomes the organization\u0027s most important international ambassador.\n\nDespite all his doubts and the break-up with his girlfriend, David continues to hope for enlightenment. The filmmaker becomes a pilgrim on the trail of the TM movement. His steps are now closely followed by the organization - as he gets too close to some well-kept secrets. When David Lynch finally acknowledges the film team\u0027s research with a threat of legal action, the inner peace is gone. David travels to the USA and India: instead of the \u201Cheaven on earth\u201D prophesied by Maharishi, he encounters abysses. Finally, in the heights of the Himalayas, at the icy source of the Ganges, David finds his own truth.\n\nDavid Sieveking manages the feat of telling his detective-like search for meaning as a light-footed journey into the cinematic self. On his adventurous odyssey from Berlin\u0027s Teufelsberg via Hollywood to the Himalayas, he combines spiritual experiences and bizarre observations with exciting documentary investigation.\n\n#documentary #fulldocumentary #transcendentalmeditation #davidlynch #maharishi \n-------\n\nSubscribe to wocomoHUMANITY: https://goo.gl/5Sp36B\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/wocomo\n\n-------\n\nOriginal title: David Wants To Fly\nA film by David Sieveking\n\u00A9 2010, Licensed by Lichtblick Film\n\n------- \nDocumentaries about people and cultures from around the globe: wocomoHUMANITY offers high-quality content which is produced by leading production companies. \n\nCheck out our other channels to watch high quality documentaries:\n\u25B7 wocomoDOCS: https://www.youtube.com/wocomoDOCS\n\u25B7 wocomoWILDLIFE: https://www.youtube.com/wocomoWILDLIFE\n\u25B7 wocomoHISTORY: https://www.youtube.com/wocomoHISTORY\n\u25B7 wocomoTRAVEL: https://www.youtube.com/wocomoTRAVEL\n\u25B7 wocomoCOOK: https://www.youtube.com/wocomoCOOK\n\nWocomo HUMANITY is part of the Wocomo channel network by NIKITA VENTURES.
