      "description": "In this episode of I Call Bullsh*t, Kristina Braly exposes the Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) industry, a $35 billion empire built on false promises, manipulation, and financial ruin for most participants. These \u201Cbusiness opportunities\u201D masquerade as female empowerment, side hustles, or easy passive income, but the reality is only 1% of participants ever make a profit\u2014and many go into serious debt instead. What Is an MLM? The key differences between MLMs and pyramid schemes (spoiler: they\u2019re nearly identical). Why 99% of Participants Lose Money: FTC data on income disclosure statements proves these businesses are set up to fail. Manipulation Tactics: Love bombing, toxic positivity, shaming quitters, and weaponized female empowerment. MLM Horror Stories: People losing their homes, maxing out credit cards, and destroying friendships for the \u201Cdream.\u201D The Cult-Like Mentality: Why MLMs mirror religious cults, and how they brainwash members into staying. Red Flags to Spot an MLM: From Facebook DMs to overpriced starter kits, how to recognize a scam before you get sucked in.
