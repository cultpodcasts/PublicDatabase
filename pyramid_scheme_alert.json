      "title": "The Cult of Multi-Level Marketing, a Video with Narration by Robert L. FitzPatrick",
      "description": "This is Robert FitzPatrick. Of all the presentations I have prepared for consumers on multi-level marketing, MLM, I consider this one the most important.\n\n If you are in an MLM or are being enrolled or want to know what MLM is all about, I believe this presentation will be the most important information for you to escape or avoid its entrapment to help other escape or avoid it.\n\n MLM\u2019s primary method of deception is disguise.  This presentation removes the disguises to reveal MLM\u2019s actual identity. What is uncovered is grotesque and disturbing. Some people will not face it.  \n\nMLM is a coercive cult and a destructive pyramid scheme. \n\nFrom my experience, as long as MLM is allowed to wear its masks, of \u201Cbusiness\u201D, \u201Cincome opportunity\u201D and \u201Cdirect selling,\u201D it maintains power to deceive, and protection from law enforcement and media exposure. \n\nThis presentation focuses on cult identity. However, to see the cult, MLM itself must fully identified and the pyramid scheme must also be understood. Then, how it gains control over people\u2019s lives and inflicts its personal and financial damage become clear.",
