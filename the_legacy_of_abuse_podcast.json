Mark Barclay also knowingly had a violent convicted felon around children in his church and in a position of leadership without disclosing to his congregation. These discussions are particularly timely given the current political climate.

In the face of this unconventional perspective, Hannah\u0027s tenacity and self-advocacy shine through as she sought her own path to education, defying the constraints imposed by the School and the Church.

In this episode, we are joined by Jordan, a former student who shares his personal journey of growing up in the church and attending Legacy Christian Academy from Kindergarten to Grade 12. He opens up about the lingering effects of the control he experienced during his time at the school, which even extended into his adult life when he was sent away to Williams Lake, British Columbia. Recently, Jordan obtained a copy of his school cumulative file, and together, we examine the troubling contents of three pages that document a history of corporal punishment inflicted upon him, all of which were left within his cumulative file by former staff.
