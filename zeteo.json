      "description": "This week, members of Congress were supposed to be able to view the Epstein Files, unredacted. Zeteo\u2019s Prem Thakker spoke with California Congressman Ro Khanna, who got the exclusive look at the documents, but says the government appears to be protecting specific people \u2013 including at least six powerful people from both the US and abroad.\n\nThe files where survivors \u201Cmade statements implicating rich and powerful men who raped these underage girls\u201D are redacted, the congressman says.\n\nKhanna, alongside Rep. Thomas Massie, led Congress to pass the Epstein Files Transparency Act to force the release of the government\u2019s files relating to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. After repeated episodes of the Department of Justice flouting the transparency standards laid out in the act, the agency said it would grant lawmakers access to unredacted files that they could view at the DOJ building. And still, Khanna reveals, the \u201CEpstein Class,\u201D and the Trump administration, are acting with \u201Cimpunity.\u201D\n\nWatch our conversation with Rep. Khanna above to hear the latest revelations about the \u201Cgruesomeness\u201D in the files and the \u201Cdisgusting\u201D tactics the government is deploying to shroud it.\n\n*This conversation was published a week ago on zeteo.com.

      "description": "\u201CI know a lot of stuff, but I can\u0027t report it because the victims don\u0027t want to go public, and they\u0027re afraid. And, you know, I can\u0027t go out there and say this happened without having some proof\u2026 I just keep digging and hopefully I\u0027ll get to the truth, you know? But, this whole climate in the media is very disheartening.\u201D\n\nIn this Substack Live, John Harwood speaks with journalist Julie K. Brown, whose investigations into Jeffrey Epstein led to his arrest in 2019. They discuss Trump\u2019s relationship with Epstein, the files and if the Trump administration can continue to ignore calls for the full release.\n\nThe investigative reporter who broke the Epstein story in November 2018 says she believes she still hasn\u2019t learned the full scope of crimes in this scandal involving wealthy and powerful people and the young girls who were victimized.\n\nThis Substack Live discussion published last week on\u00A0zeteo.com.
