Yet behind closed doors, Dr. Robert Hadden assaulted hundreds \u2014 perhaps thousands \u2014 of unsuspecting patients. When it looked like no one would be held accountable, the survivors engaged in a decade-long fight for justice.\n\nBinge all episodes of Exposed exclusively and ad-free by joining Wondery\u002B in the Wondery App, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.
