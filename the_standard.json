Despite being described as a cult, the group still operates as a church in Ilford, east London. In 2019, an innocent black woman named Joy Morgan was murdered by a fellow member of this radical religious group, at the age of just 20 - and Joy\u2019s story is the subject of The Missing Sister, a new six-part investigative podcast. And in part two, The Standard\u2019s Commissioning Editor and Culture Writer Vicky Jessop joins us to discuss the new David Bowie Centre at the V\u0026A East Storehouse , where 90,000 objects from the late singer\u2019s archive are on display for the public to peruse.
