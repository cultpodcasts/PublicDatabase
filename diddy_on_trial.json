He denies all the allegations.\nWe\u2019re going to be examining what each of these federal charges mean over the coming weeks, hearing from experts and people affected in other cases involving these charges. We\u2019re starting with sex trafficking.\nAnoushka Mutanda-Dougherty speaks to Elizabeth Geddes who prosecuted R. Kelly, Dr Marcel Van Der Watt, president at the National Centre on Sexual Exploitation in the US, along with Lala Appleberry from Survivor Network NC.\nThe Diddy on Trial podcast is here to investigate the rumours, confront the theories, and give you the answers that you need.\nWe also want YOU to be part of the conversation.

He founded Bay Boy Records, which launched the careers of the Notorious B.I.G. and Mary J Blige.\nHis current legal issues began when he was sued by his ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura, also known as Cassie, in late 2023. She accused him of violently abusing and raping her. That lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount a day after it was filed, with Mr Combs maintaining his innocence.\nHis controversial history with Ms Ventura resurfaced in 2024, when CCTV footage emerged showing Mr Combs kicking his former girlfriend as she lay on a hotel hallway floor in 2016.\nMultiple people have filed lawsuits accusing Mr Combs of sexual assault, with accusations dating back to 1991. He denies all claims.\nIn his criminal case, he faces federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and transportation to engage in prostitution, and is accused of kidnapping, drugging and coercing women into sexual activities, sometimes by using firearms or threatening them with violence.\nIn a raid on his Los Angeles mansion, police found supplies that they said were intended for use in orgies known as \u201Cfreak offs\u201D, including drugs and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil. Mr Combs denies all the charges.",
