He founded Bad Boy Records, which launched the careers of the Notorious B.I.G. and Mary J Blige. His current legal issues began when he was sued by his ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura, also known as Cassie, in late 2023. She accused him of violently abusing and raping her. That lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount a day after it was filed, with Mr Combs maintaining his innocence. His controversial history with Ms Ventura resurfaced in 2024, when CCTV footage emerged showing Mr Combs kicking his former girlfriend as she lay on a hotel hallway floor in 2016. Multiple people have filed lawsuits accusing Mr Combs of sexual assault, with accusations dating back to 1991. He denies all claims. He is accused of the federal charges of kidnapping, drugging and coercing women into sexual activities, sometimes by using firearms or threatening them with violence. He denies the charges.",

      "description": "This is your quick round-up so you\u2019re ready for the start of Diddy\u2019s trial, which is set to start on 12 May. Since we launched this podcast in November 2024, we have had five criminal counts against Diddy, he\u2019s been denied bail three times, faced accusations of witness tampering, lost a lawyer, featured in a Kanye - or Ye - track from behind bars, gone grey, demanded a gag order, launched an Instagram campaign and accused the government of racism. And that\u2019s just on the federal side of things. On the civil side, we\u2019ve had bombshell balcony-dangling allegations, people from Michael Jackson to OJ woven into the web of the \u2018Diddy-verse\u2019, claims against Jay\u2013Z issued and then withdrawn, while the Texan trial lawyer Tony Buzbee told the BBC he has over 150 cases he could raise against Diddy. What does Sean \u2018Diddy\u2019 Combs say? He\u2019s denied all the allegations and consistently said he\u2019s never sexually assaulted anyone - man, or woman, adult or minor. So how did we end up here, before his nearly 8-month stint in one of the US\u2019s most notorious prisons, Diddy was a hip hop mogul, mega star and multi millionaire. The Diddy on Trial podcast is here to investigate the rumours, confront the theories, and give you the answers that you need. We also want YOU to be part of the conversation. Have you any burning questions about the cases or the upcoming trial? Heard a theory that doesn\u2019t sit right with you? Get in touch now via WhatsApp: 0330 123 555 1.

He founded Bad Boy Records, which launched the careers of the Notorious B.I.G. and Mary J Blige. His current legal issues began when he was sued by his ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura, also known as Cassie, in late 2023. She accused him of violently abusing and raping her. That lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount a day after it was filed, with Mr Combs maintaining his innocence. His controversial history with Ms Ventura resurfaced in 2024, when CCTV footage emerged showing Mr Combs kicking his former girlfriend as she lay on a hotel hallway floor in 2016. Multiple people have filed lawsuits accusing Mr Combs of sexual assault, with accusations dating back to 1991. He denies all claims. He is accused of the federal charges of kidnapping, drugging and coercing women into sexual activities, sometimes by using firearms or threatening them with violence. He denies the charges.",

She says it happened in 2016, while she was at the home of Diddy\u0027s then-girlfriend Casandra \u0022Cassie\u0022 Ventura. He denies the allegations. Diddy is currently behind bars in a notorious New York jail, awaiting trial on three federal charges, which he also denies.
