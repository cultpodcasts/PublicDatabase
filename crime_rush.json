      "description": "Ruby Franke was a MONSTER even before Jodi Hildebrandt came along | Devil in the Family \n\nDevil in the Family reaction | The Fall of Ruby Franke \n\nIn today\u0027s video, I do a quick recap of the Ruby Franke case, and then I discuss the new docu-series, \u0022The Devil in the Family - The Fall of Ruby Franke.\u0022\n\nWhen I first started my channel, I covered this case in more detail. Click on the link below for that video:\nhttps://youtu.be/Eri3dEvlmP4\n\nI also did an update of Ruby Franke \u0026 Jodi Hildebrandt\u0027s sentencing:\nhttps://youtu.be/_peiTiSSBsk\n\nI definitely recommend that you watch the docuseries. It was well done and shows unseen footage of what took place behind the scenes while filming for their family vlogging YouTube Channel, 8 passengers. \n\nOne thing this docuseries made perfectly clear, was that Ruby Franke was a monster of a parent, way before Jodi Hildebrandt ever came along. \n\nThere is also more information on Jodi Hildebrandt and exactly how she managed to worm her way into the family. \n\nI also briefly discuss Ruby\u0027s oldest, Shari Franke\u0027s book \u0022My Mother\u0027s House\u0022 and her experience of growing up as Ruby Franke\u0027s oldest daughter.\n\nI hope you enjoy the video.

Once they united, bizarre things started happening, and together, the couple formed a group that led them down a path of delusions, darkness, and death.\n\nLori was prepared to eliminate anything that stood in the way of her being with Chad Daybell \u0026 their \u0022mission\u0022. Sadly she eventually came to a point where she felt that her own children were in the way.\n\nThis is an unbelievably tragic story that has shocked the entire world.\n\nMy condolences to the loved one of the many victims in today\u0027s case.\n\n#DoomsdayMom #Chad Daybell #LoriVallowDaybell",

Colin Batley declared himself the Prince Priest and leader of the group. He claimed to have direct contact with the gods and encouraged disgusting and demeaning rituals. \n\nColin even involved his wife, Elaine and she also became part of this horrific cult.\n\nColin\u0027s followers were indoctrinated and brainwashed to believe that he was omniscient and this made it easy for him to control them. He allowed them little freedom and they even had to give him most of their income. He told them they were part of \u0022The Church, \u0022 which was their main priority.\n\nColin did horrific things for financial gain, power, and his sick s*xual fantasies. \n\n#KidwellyCult #SatanicSexCult #ColinBatley",
