      "description": "They\u0027re BAAA-AACCKKK! And so are we with a re-release on one of the wildest cults we\u0027ve covered yet! Have you seen the colorful ads enticing you to come experience \u0022China before Communism\u0022 through the art of song and dance at a Shen Yun performance? What about the far-right wing newspaper \u0022The Epoch Times\u0022 that preaches misogynistic, racist, homophobic and prejudiced views? They\u0027re both owned by the dangerous cult of Falun Gong which Ash tells Caitlyn and Lindsey about this week! Caitlyn co-hosts PNW Haunts \u0026 Homicides , a podcast about true crime, the paranormal, and all kinds of spooky sh*t in the Pacific Northwest! Lindsey is the co-host of Ye Olde Crime , a podcast about spooky, strange, and surreal stories of the past.

      "description": "If you watched Tiger King on Netflix in 2020, you probably remember the a**hole with a long ponytail who constantly dresses like he\u0027s on safari and surrounds himself with skinny women who like like Jane from Tarzan, constantly toting tigers on leashes. That man was Doc Antle, owner of Myrtle Beach Safari, the \u0022zoo\u0022 that inspired Joe Exotic to open The Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park. Antle started off as a magician who got real tight with famous Guru Swami Satchidananda Saraswati, and became somewhat of a celebrity at Swami\u0027s Yogaville compound in Virginia. He began claiming to be a doctor and enlightened being, amassing followers and abusing teenage girls, and things only got crazier from there. Antle is a notorious abuser of big cats, but today\u0027s story more focuses on Antle himself and the cult that he runs, but calls a \u0022wildlife preserve\u0022. TW: Animal abuse and severe maiming SPOILERS: Ash and Fallon also discuss Max\u0027s new docuseries Chimp Crazy and one of the most insane stories Ash has ever heard. \u0022Former nurse-turned-exotic-animal-broker Tonia Haddix spends her days caring for animals in captivity, referring to herself as the \u0022Dolly Parton of chimps.\u0022 However, her limitless love for one chimpanzee spins into a wild cat-and-mouse game with authorities and an animal rights group. Through the experiences of Tonia and other \u0022chimp moms,\u0022 \u0022Chimp Crazy\u0022 is a series that reveals the bonds between owners and their highly intelligent great ape pets, as well as the risks to the welfare of the animals themselves.\u0022- Wikipedia Play Bingo with us!

This episode is a throwback from way back when in Season 2, in 2020... we were such babies!! Ash and Cam dive into two different cults for your listening pleasure! Ash talks about the Buddhafield cult and its leader Jaime Gomez aka Michel aka Andreas aka Reyji (or God King), who started off as a small time gay porn actor. And Cam covers Order of the Solar Temple, a super secret society whose founders drew inspiration from different UFO, Doomsday and New Age cults, making sure they hit all the bases. The gals also discuss some of the very relatable reasons that people join cults, and how the leaders control members.

Booo! Before you watch it, the gals figured they should let you know, in their opinions, why you shouldn\u0027t.\n\nAsh and Fallon are spilling the tea on all the behind-the-scenes drama from the cast of \u0022That \u002770s Show\u0022. Danny Masterson, a hardcore Scientologist, recruited many co-stars into the \u0022church\u0022, creating some seriously culty vibes on set. Scandals of underage relationships, substance abuse, and bad behavior from Masterson, Ashton Kutcher, and Wilmer Valderrama cast a dark shadow over this seemingly fun show. Masterson\u0027s 2023 rape conviction and 30-year prison sentence finally exposed this pig and what was actually happening behind the scenes of one of America\u0027s favorite sitcoms.\n\n\n\u2728https://www.patreon.com/TSFU\n\n\uD83D\uDD78\uFE0FVisit That\u0027s So Fcked Up\u0027s Website: https://tsfuthepodcast.com/\n\uD83C\uDF89Support our work and get all kinds of nifty perks: https://www.patreon.com/TSFU\n\u2615\uFE0FBuy us a coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/tsfuthepodcast\n\uD83D\uDCF2Subscribe to our podcast on Apple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/thats-so-fcked-up/id1508752329\n\uD83C\uDFA7or Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/2zo86q0aYvNSg8prn1k73N?si=590fae149eb24218\n\uD83D\uDCF8Follow TSFU on IG: https://www.instagram.com/tsfuthepodcast/\n\uD83D\uDC40Follow Ash on IG: https://www.instagram.com/ashleyloverichards/\n\uD83D\uDC7EJoin our Discord community: https://discord.gg/c2HwBUDsUx\n\n-Audio editing by Gaytrice Perdue.\n-Research by Elizabeth Vandenbosch.\n-Sources:\n\n- https://www.scientology.org/what-is-scientology/#slide2\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology_and_celebrities\n- https://www.msn.com/en-us/entertainment/other/how-danny-masterson-got-that-70s-show-cast-to-take-part-in-scientology-parties/ar-AA1gFVPu\n- https://www.imdb.com/news/ni63974313/\n- https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/18/entertainment/laura-prepon-scientology/index.html\n- https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/70s-show-star-laura-prepon-reveals-practiced-scientology-79507143\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Prepon\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmer_Valderrama\n- https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-09-15/ashton-kutcher-resigns-anti-sex-trafficking-nonprofit-danny-masterson-letter\n- https://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/celebrity/danny-masterson-s-ex-stepdad-accuses-siblings-of-lying-about-upbringing-to-help-rapist-that-70s-show-star/ar-AA1gvPjH\n- https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/31/entertainment/danny-masterson-verdict-second-trial/index.html\n- https://people.com/tv/danny-masterson-charged-rape-timeline-of-allegations/\n- https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/danny-mastersons-victims-portray-predator-powerful-impact-statements-rcna104077\n- https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/harrowing-evidence-leading-to-danny-masterson-s-sentence-came-from-three-brave-woman/ar-AA1grdNP\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYz1ubz5bo\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM_NXjwugmc\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYz1ubz5bo\u0026amp;t=971s\n- https://www.businessinsider.com/that-70s-show-cast-real-ages-versus-characters-2023-8#danny-masterson-played-steven-hyde-known-as-hyde-the-groups-rebel-9\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id_0P576KBE\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorn_(organization)\n- https://allthatsinteresting.com/ashley-ellerin\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_%2770s_Show\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorn_(organization)",

Every month we\u0027ll be releasing a past Bible episode here on the regular feed!

Ash started her Biblical journey of learning way back in December 2022 with previous co-host Michelle Mosher (episodes 101-136), in a Patreon exclusive segment called \u0022Ash and Michelle Do the Bible\u0022. Michelle had spent many of her teen years in a Pentecostal cult and Ash had never picked up a Bible. But when Michelle got moving and grooving in other areas of life, Ash knew she had to keep quenching her thirst for that Biblical knowledge. Now friend and comedian Kristal Adams continues telling Ash about the Good Word every month on \u0022Ash Learns the Bible\u0022, only on Patreon! \u2728For ad free access to 250 additional TSFU episodes, including all of our Bible content and all other bonus content, as well as a shite ton of other cool stuff, check out our Patreon here \u2728 \u0026#x1f578;\uFE0FVisit That\u0027s So Fcked Up\u0027s Website: https://tsfuthepodcast.com/ \u0026#x1f389;Support our work and get all kinds of nifty perks: https://www.patreon.com/TSFU \u2615\uFE0FBuy us a coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/tsfuthepodcast \u0026#x1f4f2;Subscribe to our podcast on Apple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/thats-so-fcked-up/id1508752329 \u0026#x1f3a7;or Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/2zo86q0aYvNSg8prn1k73N?si=590fae149eb24218 \u0026#x1f4f8;Follow TSFU on IG: https://www.instagram.com/tsfuthepodcast/ \u0026#x1fa77;Follow Ash on IG: https://www.instagram.com/ashleyloverichards/ \u0026#x1f47e;Join our Discord community: https://discord.gg/c2HwBUDsUx -Audio editing and research by Ryan Pregent. -Research and Storytelling by Michelle Mosher. -Sources: https://www.britannica.com/topic/Judaism/Biblical-Judaism-20th-4th-century-bce https://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Projects/Reln91/Power/lilith.htm https://sites.nd.edu/manuscript-studies/2015/04/09/the-slaying-of-abel-in-apocryphal-tradition/ King James Bible English Standard Catholic Bible Hebrew Bible Book of Enoch Life of Adam Eve The Reference Bible, Das Bibelwerk : Inter Pauca problesmata de enigmatibus ex tomis canonicis, nunc prompta sunt Praefatio et libri de Pentateucho Moysi",

Every detail of her life was controlled until she found the courage to escape.\n\nRift is Cait\u0027s amazing story of breaking free from this oppressive upbringing and forging her own path. She dives into the lingering effects of patriarchal religious trauma and her own role in those systems. Her story sheds light on the impacts of \u0022purity culture\u0022 and the abuse in some extremist Christian communities.\n\nCheck out \u0022https://www.amazon.com/Rift-Memoir-Breaking-Christian-Patriarchy/dp/0802883583\u0022\u00A0on Amazon!\n\n\n\u2728https://www.patreon.com/TSFU\n\n\uD83D\uDD78\uFE0FVisit That\u0027s So Fcked Up\u0027s Website: https://tsfuthepodcast.com/\n\uD83C\uDF89Support our work and get all kinds of nifty perks: https://www.patreon.com/TSFU\n\u2615\uFE0FBuy us a coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/tsfuthepodcast\n\uD83D\uDCF2Subscribe to our podcast on Apple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/thats-so-fcked-up/id1508752329\n\uD83C\uDFA7or Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/2zo86q0aYvNSg8prn1k73N?si=590fae149eb24218\n\uD83D\uDCF8Follow TSFU on IG: https://www.instagram.com/tsfuthepodcast/\n\uD83E\uDE77Follow Ash on IG: https://www.instagram.com/ashleyloverichards/\n\uD83D\uDC7EJoin our Discord community: https://discord.gg/c2HwBUDsUx\n-Audio editing by River Innes.",

Chad Daybell is currently on trial and the episode starts with an update of what\u0027s happened since our original episode aired. Cam covered the story of Lori Vallow and her fifth husband Chad Daybell, and the disappearance of several of those around them. Daybell is the author of several Doomsday books and was the leader of a small cult, of which Lori was a devout follower. When Lori started to refer to her children, Tylee (16), and JJ (7), as zombies people began to worry a little, but not too much. Once no one could find or speak to the children, and Lori gave conflicting stories of their whereabouts, for six months, she was finally arrested in February of 2020. The story leading up to the disappearance of Tylee and JJ, and the elopement and subsequent arrest of Vallow and Daybell in Hawaii, is stranger than fiction. \u2728 If you wanna get your TSFU episodes ad free and on Tuesdays instead of Fridays, check out our Patreon!

There has been a recent resurgence of talk about the Synanon organization, thanks in part to documentaries released on Max and Paramount\u0026#43;. So we decided to reach back to December 2022 for a re-release of our Synanon episode. Synanon started out as an alternative to AA, a rehab program for \u0022dope fiends\u0022, but quickly turned into a sinister and deadly cult. Synanon was also the basis for many of the programs that we see today in the TTI (troubled teen industry). In this special bonus episode, Ash is joined by badass survivor Jen Carole, whose parents were murdered by Josef DeAngelo aka the Golden State Killer. Jen grew up during the 60s and 70s in Southern California, when are where Synanon began. \u2728 If you wanna get your TSFU episodes ad free and on Tuesdays instead of Fridays, check out our Patreon!

She believed that all diseases came from food, and starving was the only cure. She opened her \u201Csanitarium\u201D in Olalla, Washington in the early 1900s, calling it Wilderness Heights. But residents of the small town called it \u0022Starvation Heights\u0022 because of the countless patients who went to see Hazzard... and vanished. Both figuratively and literally. This is a story of murder.... but are y\u0027all feeling some cultiness too?? \u0022Paging Dr. Hazzard\u0022! Did they only say that on Gray\u0027s Anatomy? Were they ever paging doctors?

Trevin from \u0022Live, Laugh, Larceny\u0022 and I went live a couple of weeks ago to talk about the last two episodes of \u0022Love Has Won: The Cult of Mother God\u0022.\u0022Love Has Won: The Cult of Mother God chronicles the life and death of Amy Carlson, also known as Mother God, a self-proclaimed spiritual savior who built a cult through her online manifestos and live-streaming sessions. As Amy\u0027s health declined, her followers believed her death would lead to her evacuation by UFO and salvation for humanity. Told through the eyes of Amy\u2019s devotees and constructed from the cult\u2019s archival footage, the three-part docuseries captures the perils of internet proselytizing and a conspiracy-driven faith.\u0022 - HBOIt\u0027s a BINGE for us y\u0027all!\uD83D\uDEA8Make sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel for all sorts of awesome extra content: https://www.youtube.com/@tsfuthepodcastlive\uD83D\uDD78\uFE0FVisit That\u0027s So Fcked Up\u0027s Website: https://tsfuthepodcast.com/\uD83E\uDE77Follow Ash on IG: https://www.instagram.com/ashleyloverichards/\uD83D\uDCF8Follow TSFU on IG: https://www.instagram.com/tsfuthepodcast/\uD83D\uDC7EJoin our Discord community: https://discord.gg/2SpVyk8mC7 (that\u0027s where the secret Patreon community is and where we plan book and documentary club!)*Please note that \u0022YouTube Live\u0022 segments are not as curated as regular episodes.

Recently discussed in an interview with siblings Shelly Snow Pordea and Jon Snow, the IFB (Independent Fundamentalist Baptist) cult is big on creating and running these facilities. So in addition to the rampant abuse in regular TTI facilities, the IFB institutions (aka torture prisons for children) also bring religious abuse into the picture.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not therapy, it\u2019s the widespread phenomenon of children being abused and tortured and sometimes even killed in the \u201Ccare\u201D of these facilities.

At the time of the recording, \u0022Mother God\u0022 had been found dead just weeks prior. It\u0027s not been two and half years and a great documentary just came out on HBO!Check out the YouTube LIVE we did recently to talk about the documentary!Watch Love Has Won: The Cult of Mother God here!Ash covers Love Has Won and the mysterious death of its leader Amy Carlson, aka \u0022Mother God\u0022. Before her death, Mother God was a belligerent and abusive alcoholic who claimed to be paralyzed from the waist down (videos prove otherwise). She and her group, including Jason Castillo, one of many \u0022Father God\u0022s over the years, had been doing daily livestreams on YouTube since the mid 2000s, gaining followers by selling magical phone healing sessions, \u0022god squad\u0022 apparel, etc... the usual. But it appears that Love Has Lost, as Carlson\u0027s mummified corpse was found wrapped in a sleeping bag and Christmas lights, with glitter surrounding her hollow eye sockets, in a makeshift shrine less than three weeks ago.\uD83D\uDD2A\u2728If you\u0027d like access to over 125 episodes that aren\u0027t on the regular feed, and you\u0027d like them all ad free, join our Patreon for as little as $5 a month! https://www.patreon.com/TSFU\uD83D\uDEA8Make sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@tsfuthepodcastlive\uD83D\uDCF2Subscribe to our podcast on Apple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/thats-so-fcked-up/id1508752329\uD83C\uDFA7or Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/2zo86q0aYvNSg8prn1k73N?si=590fae149eb24218\u2615\uFE0FBuy us a coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/tsfuthepodcast\uD83C\uDF89Support our work and get all kinds of nifty perks: https://www.patreon.com/TSFU\uD83E\uDE77Follow Ash on IG: https://www.instagram.com/ashleyloverichards/\uD83D\uDD78\uFE0FVisit That\u0027s So Fcked Up\u0027s Website: https://tsfuthepodcast.com/\uD83D\uDCF8Follow TSFU on IG: https://www.instagram.com/tsfuthepodcast/\uD83D\uDC7EJoin our Discord community: https://discord.gg/c2HwBUDsUx-Audio engineering by Evette Darensbourg.This show is part of the Spreaker Prime Network, if you are interested in advertising on this podcast, contact us at https://www.spreaker.com/show/4523794/advertisement",

      "description": "This week, Ali tells Ash about the \u0022German torture cult\u0022 that you may have recently heard about on TikTok or other socials, but this baby was born, lived a long and fucked life and died years ago.Started in 1961 by Nazi pedophile Paul Sh\u00E4fer, this isolated colony was located in the rural town of Parral and was known as a little German paradise in Chile. Villagers thought that if their child got picked to live there (or even kidnapped) that they\u0027d have a better life, without poverty. Behind the scenes, there was the kidnapping and sexual abuse of children, manual labor, the underground internment, torture, and murder of Chilean dissidents during the military dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet, and more atrocities committed under Sh\u00E4fer and his cronies. The colony still stands in Chile and is now presented as a holiday destination, luring tourists with their cute little gingerbread buildings and Oktoberfest.

Amazon recently came out with Desperately Seeking Soulmate: Escaping Twin Flames and Netflix came out with Escaping Twin Flames today!Back in August of 2022, Ash and Michelle talked about the insane cult that\u0027s supposedly trying to help people find their super soulmates aka Twin Flames. Michelle talked about a truly insidious group, Twin Flames Universe. These asshats took a very old concept and have sold it to thousands, claiming that everyone has a \u0022twin flame\u0022 and that you should pursue you twin flame no matter what, even if they take out a restraining order against you. There are also too many women in the group, so leaders are coercing other members into sex changes. Join them as they break down this dumpster fire.Ash will go LIVE on YOUTUBE soon to do an update on what she\u0027s learned since last year\u0027s episode came out!If you\u0027d like access to over 125 episodes that aren\u0027t on the regular feed, and you\u0027d like them all ad free, join our Patreon for as little as $5 a month!Patreon.com/tsfu-We have super fun merch, go take a look!-We\u0027d love to see you in our Discord, come hang out!-Audio editing by Gaytrice Perdue.This show is part of the Spreaker Prime Network, if you are interested in advertising on this podcast, contact us at https://www.spreaker.com/show/4523794/advertisement",

She has spent 54 years in prison for stabbing a dead or dying woman. We are not negating the brutality of the crimes committed by the Manson Family, and do not wish to diminish the atrocities that were inflicted on the victims.One important fact that is often misreported is that Leslie was not present at the infamous Tate murders on Cielo Drive. Many myths surround the \u0022Manson Girls\u0022, and after reading Karlene Faith\u0027s book Leslie Van Houten\u0027s Long Prison Journey, Ash felt the need to tell Leslie\u0027s story as it happened, and not how it\u0027s been sensationalized by the media.Again, we implore you to listen to these episodes with an open heart and mind.

By the time this year rolled around, GOOP has expanded to include a Netflix series, a podcast, retail stores, a book imprint called goop Press, and a franchise of wellness summits.This episode is brought to you by BetterHelp.

I feel like \u0022best life\u0022 sure gets tossed around a lot in these pyramid scheme slogans, and literally almost no one is living anywhere near their best lives when they\u0027re trapped in these awesome multi-level marketing businesses. Although founder Mark Hughes definitely was once he started the company, with no nutritional background whatsoever, in 1980. Hughes expanded rapidly and internationally, particularly into financially vulnerable Latino communities. There\u0027s probably an Herbalife club or five in your very city right. now. Ash and Fallon also discuss how Hughes may have learned his MLM skills while he was stuck at a Troubled Teen Industry \u0022residential school\u0022. Troubled teen industry victim to MLM/cult leader.

Hint: it stands for multi-level marketing! What\u0027s the difference between an MLM and a pyramid scheme? Nothing. Are MLMs cults? Yup. Ash tells former co-host Cam about the pyramid scheme that blew up in the mid 2000s thanks to their \u0022buttery soft\u0022 leggings that came in crazy patterns and apparently fit everyone like a glove (even according to Cam\u0027s mom!). LuLaRoe offered women, mostly young mothers, the promise of working part-time from home, for full-time income and the ability to be with their kids. But the family-owned business grew faster than anyone imagined, and storage and greed problems caused the smelly leggings epidemic, which led to dozens of lawsuits and hundreds of lives ruined.

Jen grew up during the 60s and 70s in Southern California, when are where Synanon began. Synanon started out as an alternative to AA, a rehab program for \u0022dope fiends\u0022, but quickly turned into a sinister and deadly cult. Synanon was also the basis for many of the programs that we see today in the TTI (troubled teen industry). -Join us on Patreon for as little as $2 a month at patreon.com/tsfu!-For more info about today\u0027s story, check out our sources (available on Fridays).-Play the new and improved version of \u0022Cult Bingo\u0022 with us!-We have awesome new merch, go take a look!-We\u0027d love to see you in our Discord, come hang out!-Follow us on Instagram and Twitter!-Audio editing by Nicole Peek.This show is part of the Spreaker Prime Network, if you are interested in advertising on this podcast, contact us at https://www.spreaker.com/show/4523794/advertisement",

You probably know him from Requiem for a Dream, The Dallas Buyers Club, or his band Thirty Seconds To Mars. But the internet is great at hiding things and while Leto has been preying on girls as young as 14 for decades, and hosting weird retreats for his fans where performances are called \u0022Church of Mars\u0022, all of this has managed to be swept under the rug. His fans call themselves the Echelon and Leto the Prophet. Many went to a 2019 Croatia retreat where Leto walked around looking like Jesus and all of his fans followed him around, also in white garb. This cult gathering is scheduled again for this year. Get ready for a weird ride.

But Larry long outstayed his welcome with this vulnerable group of college kids, billing himself as a \u201Ctruth teller\u201D and \u0022counseling\u0022 them, and one by one, sucking them into his evolving cult.

Jeepers Creepers!Ash covers the Alamo Christian Foundation, a fervent Evangelical cult founded in Hollywood, CA in the late \u002760s. It started off like so many other cults, a wannabe actress and a wannabe record producer get together, pick up some \u0022dirty hippies\u0022 off the streets and baptize them in the ocean. But they got lucky because all of these shenanigans led to them getting their own nationally syndicated Sunday morning tv show where they would sing songs and praise the good lord, and attract plenty of new followers. They sold bedazzled jackets to celebrities far and wide, made by the children in the cult.

That man was Doc Antle, owner of Myrtle Beach Safari, the \u0022zoo\u0022 that inspired Joe Exotic to open The Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park. Antle started off as a magician who got real tight with famous Guru Swami Satchidananda Saraswati, and became somewhat of a celebrity at Swami\u0027s Yogaville compound in Virginia. He began claiming to be a doctor and enlightened being, amassing followers and abusing teenage girls, and things only got crazier from there.

Ash talks about the pyramid scheme that blew up in the mid 2000s thanks to their \u0022buttery soft\u0022 leggings that came in crazy patterns and apparently fit everyone like a glove (even according to Cam\u0027s mom!). LulaRoe offered women, mostly young mothers, the promise of working part-time from home, for full-time income and the ability to be with their kids. But the family-owned business grew faster than anyone imagined, and storage and greed problems caused the smelly leggings epidemic, which led to dozens of lawsuits and hundreds of lives ruined.

Jeepers Creepers!Ash dives into the life of Anne Hamilton-Byrne, and how she eventually became the leader of a yoga/LSD/baby-napping/Children of the Corn cult. Born Evelyn Edwards, Anne grew up poor and spent time in orphanages in rich neighborhoods as a child. Seeing how the upperclass lived, she always knew that she wanted a piece of the pie. When Evelyn\u0027s first husband died, she reinvented herself as a glamorous yoga teacher and medium named Anne Hamilton. Preaching a mishmash of Christianity, Eastern mysticism and apocalyptic prophecy, she convinced hundreds that she was Jesus, using large quantities of LSD on her members and herself. One day she had a vision that the world was going to end in some horrific way and that she needed to start a master race of children who would be left to re-educate what\u0027s left of the world. So she basically began stealing babies and made them all look alike, with the same clothes, haircuts and bleached blonde hair.  Likely going for a Von Trapp family vibe, she gave them more of a Children of the Corn look.

This week Ash covers Love Has Won and the mysterious death of its leader Amy Carlson, aka \u0022Mother God\u0022. Before her death, Mother God was a belligerent and abusive alcoholic who claimed to be paralyzed from the waist down (videos prove otherwise). She and her group, including Jason Castillo, one of many \u0022Father God\u0022s over the years, had been doing daily livestreams on YouTube since the mid 2000s, gaining followers by selling magical phone healing sessions, \u0022god squad\u0022 apparel, etc... the usual. But it appears that Love Has Lost, as Carlson\u0027s mummified corpse was found wrapped in a sleeping bag and Christmas lights, with glitter surrounding her hollow eye sockets, in a makeshift shrine less than three week ago.Like what you\u0027re hearing?

Jeepers Creepers!\u2060Young sex workers started turning up brutally murdered in the Fall of 1979 in Fall River, Massachusetts. All signs initially pointed to a 26 year old pimp named Carl Drew, who was also the alleged ring leader or a local devil-worshipping gang of pimps and sex workers. Seventeen year old sex worker Robin Murphy\u0027s testimony put Drew behind bars for the rest of his life...But was this a case of a satanic cult, with a cunning leader, at work? Or a story of small town jealousy and gossip, mixed with a smidge of satanic panic, that lead to a series of tragic murders?Like what you\u0027re hearing?
