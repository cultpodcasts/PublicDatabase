Allred, one of Ervil\u0027s many, many victims. Ash and Cam talk about how Ervil employed the antiquated blood atonement doctrine to climb his way to power of the LeBaron group, including the murder of one of his brothers and the attempted murder of another. The gals also discuss how Rulon came to lead the AUB, and the twisted reason that Ervil had him killed. We also hear, in their own words, how Anna and Bryce left the cults that they had been born into. A HUGE special thank you to Anna LeBaron and Bryce Allred for making these episodes happen!

      "description": "Join Ash and Meg Appelgate, founder and CEO of Unsilenced as they begin their series diving into the TTI (Troubled Teen Industry). There are several types of facilities that try to manipulate parents into believing that their children need residential treatment for pretty common teenaged behaviors. Recently discussed in an interview with siblings Shelly Snow Pordea and Jon Snow, the IFB (Independent Fundamentalist Baptist) cult is big on creating and running these facilities. So in addition to the rampant abuse in regular TTI facilities, the IFB institutions (aka torture prisons for children) also bring religious abuse into the picture.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not therapy, it\u2019s the widespread phenomenon of children being abused and tortured and sometimes even killed in the \u201Ccare\u201D of these facilities. Ash and Meg will also discuss a recent death at the Youth Villages in TN.\r\n\r\n\uD83D\uDEA8Find Unsilenced at: https://www.unsilenced.org/\r\n\uD83D\uDEA8Meg\u0027s Instagram: @megappelgate\r\n\uD83D\uDEA8Meg\u0027s TikTok:@megappelgate\r\n\uD83D\uDEA8Meg\u2019s new website: www.megappelgate.com\r\n\uD83D\uDEA8Link to sign up to be notified when Meg\u2019s book comes out:\r\nhttps://wfqglsgtzoc.typeform.com/Unsilenced\r\n\uD83D\uDEA8Youth Congregate Care Database: https://wfqglsgtzoc.typeform.com/database\r\n\uD83D\uDEA8NeuroRestorative Timber Ridge: https://wfqglsgtzoc.typeform.com/timberridge\r\n\uD83D\uDEA8Unsilenced Attorney Database: https://www.unsilenced.org/unsilenced-attorney-network/\r\n\uD83D\uDEA8Unsilenced Activism Network Signup: https://wfqglsgtzoc.typeform.com/activism\r\n\r\n\r\n\uD83D\uDEA8Make sure to subscribe to our channel: https://www.youtube.com/@tsfuthepodcastlive \r\n\uD83D\uDCF2Subscribe to our podcast on Apple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast... \uD83C\uDFA7or Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/2zo86q0...\r\n\u2615\uFE0FBuy us a coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/tsfuthep...\r\n\uD83C\uDF89Support our work and get all kinds of nifty perks: https://www.patreon.com/TSFU\r\n\uD83E\uDE77Follow Ash on IG: https://www.instagram.com/ashleyloverichards/\r\n\uD83D\uDD78\uFE0FVisit That\u0027s So Fcked Up\u0027s Website: https://tsfuthepodcast.com/\r\n\uD83D\uDCF8Follow TSFU on IG: https://www.instagram.com/tsfuthepodcast/\r\n\uD83D\uDC7EJoin our Discord community: https://discord.gg/2SpVyk8mC7\r\n\r\n#troubledteenindustry #healing #youth #parents",

This puppy is from the Patreon Vault, enjoy!Today we\u0027re taking you alllll the way back to May of 2021 when Ash and one of her amazing former co-hosts Cam talked about Colorado cult Love Has Won! At the time of the recording, \u0022Mother God\u0022 had been found dead just weeks prior. It\u0027s not been two and half years and a great documentary just came out on HBO!Check out the YouTube LIVE we did recently to talk about the documentary!Watch Love Has Won: The Cult of Mother God here!Ash covers Love Has Won and the mysterious death of its leader Amy Carlson, aka \u0022Mother God\u0022. Before her death, Mother God was a belligerent and abusive alcoholic who claimed to be paralyzed from the waist down (videos prove otherwise). She and her group, including Jason Castillo, one of many \u0022Father God\u0022s over the years, had been doing daily livestreams on YouTube since the mid 2000s, gaining followers by selling magical phone healing sessions, \u0022god squad\u0022 apparel, etc... the usual. But it appears that Love Has Lost, as Carlson\u0027s mummified corpse was found wrapped in a sleeping bag and Christmas lights, with glitter surrounding her hollow eye sockets, in a makeshift shrine less than three weeks ago.\uD83D\uDD2A\u2728If you\u0027d like access to over 125 episodes that aren\u0027t on the regular feed, and you\u0027d like them all ad free, join our Patreon for as little as $5 a month! https://www.patreon.com/TSFU\uD83D\uDEA8Make sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@tsfuthepodcastlive\uD83D\uDCF2Subscribe to our podcast on Apple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/thats-so-fcked-up/id1508752329\uD83C\uDFA7or Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/2zo86q0aYvNSg8prn1k73N?si=590fae149eb24218\u2615\uFE0FBuy us a coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/tsfuthepodcast\uD83C\uDF89Support our work and get all kinds of nifty perks: https://www.patreon.com/TSFU\uD83E\uDE77Follow Ash on IG: https://www.instagram.com/ashleyloverichards/\uD83D\uDD78\uFE0FVisit That\u0027s So Fcked Up\u0027s Website: https://tsfuthepodcast.com/\uD83D\uDCF8Follow TSFU on IG: https://www.instagram.com/tsfuthepodcast/\uD83D\uDC7EJoin our Discord community: https://discord.gg/c2HwBUDsUx-Audio engineering by Evette Darensbourg.This show is part of the Spreaker Prime Network, if you are interested in advertising on this podcast, contact us at https://www.spreaker.com/show/4523794/advertisement",

      "description": "This week, Ali tells Ash about the \u0022German torture cult\u0022 that you may have recently heard about on TikTok or other socials, but this baby was born, lived a long and fucked life and died years ago.Started in 1961 by Nazi pedophile Paul Sh\u00E4fer, this isolated colony was located in the rural town of Parral and was known as a little German paradise in Chile. Villagers thought that if their child got picked to live there (or even kidnapped) that they\u0027d have a better life, without poverty. Behind the scenes, there was the kidnapping and sexual abuse of children, manual labor, the underground internment, torture, and murder of Chilean dissidents during the military dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet, and more atrocities committed under Sh\u00E4fer and his cronies. The colony still stands in Chile and is now presented as a holiday destination, luring tourists with their cute little gingerbread buildings and Oktoberfest.

I feel like \u0022best life\u0022 sure gets tossed around a lot in these pyramid scheme slogans, and literally almost no one is living anywhere near their best lives when they\u0027re trapped in these awesome multi-level marketing businesses. Although founder Mark Hughes definitely was once he started the company, with no nutritional background whatsoever, in 1980. Hughes expanded rapidly and internationally, particularly into financially vulnerable Latino communities. There\u0027s probably an Herbalife club or five in your very city right. now. Ash and Fallon also discuss how Hughes may have learned his MLM skills while he was stuck at a Troubled Teen Industry \u0022residential school\u0022. Troubled teen industry victim to MLM/cult leader.

      "description": "Reeemiiiiix! This week we flashback to December 2021, when Ash first explored MLMs with former co-host Cam! The gals discussed the LuLaRoe pyramid scheme.What\u0027s an MLM? Hint: it stands for multi-level marketing! What\u0027s the difference between an MLM and a pyramid scheme? Nothing. Are MLMs cults? Yup. Ash tells former co-host Cam about the pyramid scheme that blew up in the mid 2000s thanks to their \u0022buttery soft\u0022 leggings that came in crazy patterns and apparently fit everyone like a glove (even according to Cam\u0027s mom!). LuLaRoe offered women, mostly young mothers, the promise of working part-time from home, for full-time income and the ability to be with their kids. But the family-owned business grew faster than anyone imagined, and storage and greed problems caused the smelly leggings epidemic, which led to dozens of lawsuits and hundreds of lives ruined.

Jen grew up during the 60s and 70s in Southern California, when are where Synanon began. Synanon started out as an alternative to AA, a rehab program for \u0022dope fiends\u0022, but quickly turned into a sinister and deadly cult. Synanon was also the basis for many of the programs that we see today in the TTI (troubled teen industry). -Join us on Patreon for as little as $2 a month at patreon.com/tsfu!-For more info about today\u0027s story, check out our sources (available on Fridays).-Play the new and improved version of \u0022Cult Bingo\u0022 with us!-We have awesome new merch, go take a look!-We\u0027d love to see you in our Discord, come hang out!-Follow us on Instagram and Twitter!-Audio editing by Nicole Peek.This show is part of the Spreaker Prime Network, if you are interested in advertising on this podcast, contact us at https://www.spreaker.com/show/4523794/advertisement",

And if you\u0027ve already heard it, we think it\u0027s definitely worth a re-listen.Ash covers the allegations that Leto is running an actual cult and that he\u0027s been accused of sexually abusing minors for decades. You probably know him from Requiem for a Dream, The Dallas Buyers Club, or his band Thirty Seconds To Mars. But the internet is great at hiding things and while Leto has been preying on girls as young as 14 for decades, and hosting weird retreats for his fans where performances are called \u0022Church of Mars\u0022, all of this has managed to be swept under the rug. His fans call themselves the Echelon and Leto the Prophet. Many went to a 2019 Croatia retreat where Leto walked around looking like Jesus and all of his fans followed him around, also in white garb. This cult gathering is scheduled again for this year. Get ready for a weird ride.

Jeepers Creepers!Ash watched Under the Banner of Heaven last week on Hulu and had to do a deep dive and see what was true or not! Priesthood holders? Secret Ceremonies? Ash explains the differences between Mormonism, fundamental Mormonism and the FLDS, as well as recounts her friend\u0027s experience growing up Mormon. She also covers the brutal murders of Brenda and Erica Lafferty at the hands of her husband\u0027s fanatical fundamentalist brothers.And next week Michelle will be doing a deep dive into the FLDS, so watch out for that!-For more info about today\u0027s story, check out our sources at tsfuthepodcast.com/blog.-To play the new and improved version of \u0022Murder Bingo\u0022 with us (for a chance to win a FREE month of Patreon) head over to tsfuthepodcast.com/bingo!-Or if you\u2019d just like to support your gals and the show, you can head over to patreon.com/TSFU and join for as little as $5 a month!

Jeepers Creepers!Ash covers the Alamo Christian Foundation, a fervent Evangelical cult founded in Hollywood, CA in the late \u002760s. It started off like so many other cults, a wannabe actress and a wannabe record producer get together, pick up some \u0022dirty hippies\u0022 off the streets and baptize them in the ocean. But they got lucky because all of these shenanigans led to them getting their own nationally syndicated Sunday morning tv show where they would sing songs and praise the good lord, and attract plenty of new followers. They sold bedazzled jackets to celebrities far and wide, made by the children in the cult.

You probably know him from Requiem for a Dream, The Dallas Buyers Club, or his band Thirty Seconds To Mars. But the internet is great at hiding things and while Leto has been preying on girls as young as 14 for decades, and hosting weird retreats for his fans where performances are called \u0022Church of Mars\u0022, all of this has managed to be swept under the rug. His fans call themselves the Echelon and Leto the Prophet. Many went to a 2019 Croatia retreat where Leto walked around looking like Jesus and all of his fans followed him around, also in white garb.

But it wasn\u0027t Sarma who made the order, it was conman Anthony Strangis.

That man was Doc Antle, owner of Myrtle Beach Safari, the \u0022zoo\u0022 that inspired Joe Exotic to open The Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park. Antle started off as a magician who got real tight with famous Guru Swami Satchidananda Saraswati, and became somewhat of a celebrity at Swami\u0027s Yogaville compound in Virginia. He began claiming to be a doctor and enlightened being, amassing followers and abusing teenage girls, and things only got crazier from there.

LulaRoe offered women, mostly young mothers, the promise of working part-time from home, for full-time income and the ability to be with their kids.

Jeepers Creepers!Ash dives into the life of Anne Hamilton-Byrne, and how she eventually became the leader of a yoga/LSD/baby-napping/Children of the Corn cult. Born Evelyn Edwards, Anne grew up poor and spent time in orphanages in rich neighborhoods as a child. Seeing how the upperclass lived, she always knew that she wanted a piece of the pie. When Evelyn\u0027s first husband died, she reinvented herself as a glamorous yoga teacher and medium named Anne Hamilton. Preaching a mishmash of Christianity, Eastern mysticism and apocalyptic prophecy, she convinced hundreds that she was Jesus, using large quantities of LSD on her members and herself. One day she had a vision that the world was going to end in some horrific way and that she needed to start a master race of children who would be left to re-educate what\u0027s left of the world. So she basically began stealing babies and made them all look alike, with the same clothes, haircuts and bleached blonde hair.  Likely going for a Von Trapp family vibe, she gave them more of a Children of the Corn look.

This week Ash covers Love Has Won and the mysterious death of its leader Amy Carlson, aka \u0022Mother God\u0022. Before her death, Mother God was a belligerent and abusive alcoholic who claimed to be paralyzed from the waist down (videos prove otherwise). She and her group, including Jason Castillo, one of many \u0022Father God\u0022s over the years, had been doing daily livestreams on YouTube since the mid 2000s, gaining followers by selling magical phone healing sessions, \u0022god squad\u0022 apparel, etc... the usual. But it appears that Love Has Lost, as Carlson\u0027s mummified corpse was found wrapped in a sleeping bag and Christmas lights, with glitter surrounding her hollow eye sockets, in a makeshift shrine less than three week ago.Like what you\u0027re hearing?
