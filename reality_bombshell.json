      "description": "This week on Reality Bombshell, we\u2019re going back to Breaking Amish Season 1. As a group of young Amish and Mennonite adults explored the world of the \u201CEnglish,\u201D viewers were treated to a mess of cult indoctrination, emotional manipulation, and barely hidden producer interference.\n\nAt the center of it all are Jeremiah and Sabrina. They gaslit the cast, the crew, and the audience \u2014 concocting stories, drinking too much, and blowing up everything in their path. We unpack how their chaos didn\u2019t just stir up drama, it splintered the entire cast.\n\nWere they breaking Amish, or just breaking tradition? Either way, it\u2019s one of the messiest reality TV experiments of the 2010s.\n\nHave a case or anything else reality TV related you want to hear us cover? Reach out to us at realitybombshell@gmail.com.\n\nFollow us @realitybombshell on all social media platforms. Linktr.ee/realitybombshell",
