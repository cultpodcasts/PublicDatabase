      "title": "96. From Cult to Gender Clinic: Misdiagnosis, Detransition \u0026 Healing \u2014 Layton, part 2",
      "description": "In part two of my conversation with Layton, she continues to share her journey of navigating the trauma of leaving a cult, bad therapy, the harmful effects of the trans medical industrial complex, and how she finally found wholeness. Missed part 1? Listen to episode 95 here. Layton opens up about her experience of undergoing synthetic testosterone as a female and the traumatic impact it had on her body and mind. We delve into the dangerous territory of misdiagnosis and the lack of consideration for her PTSD, dissociation, and other comorbidities by therapists and gender clinics. Layton shares her frustration at not being given the opportunity to explore healing from her trauma before being pushed towards medical gender transition. As the conversation unfolds, we explore the boundaries crossed by Layton\u0027s therapist and the power dynamics at play. How did her therapist so egregiously overlook her real needs? What countertransference issues on the part of the therapist might have contributed to this massive ethical breach? We touch on the sadistic element that may have influenced her therapist\u0027s actions and the flattery used to manipulate and groom Layton. We also discuss the importance of ethical boundaries in therapy and the potential harm caused by therapists who fail to manage their countertransference. Layton shares her journey of self-discovery and the pivotal moment when she started to question her decision to transition. Through somatic therapy, nervous system regulation, and healing her PTSD, she began to reconnect with her body and realized that she didn\u0027t have gender dysphoria. We explore the process of reconciling with her womanhood and the challenges she faced in finding her true identity. Layton is an Anthroposophical artist, Somatic practitioner, YouTuber, and detransitioner. Having left a religious cult, and then the social cult that is Gender Ideology, she is passionate about educating others about mental health, healing and spirituality in a way that heavily emphasizes self-trust and personal autonomy. While she doesn\u0027t consider herself to be an activist, she is vocal in regards to the medicalisation of children and vulnerable adults under the guise of \u0022Gender Affirming Care.\u201D Visit her website at PsychicSomatic.com X: @origina1ange1 Psychic Somatic YouTube Channel 00:00 Start [00:00:00] Trauma of synthetic testosterone.

She shares her struggles with trust, identity, and finding a sense of safety. We discuss the impact of her traumatic experiences on her mental health and how an earnest search for psychological help led her to end up pushed down the trans rabbit hole by an unscrupulous therapist who Layton has now filed a lawsuit against.This is part 1 of a two-part conversation; be on the lookout for part 2 next week!Layton is an Anthroposophical artist, Somatic practitioner, YouTuber, and detransitioner.
