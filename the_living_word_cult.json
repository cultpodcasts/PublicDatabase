In Colorado, Sam and Michaela Teres had a front row seat to those internal conversations. \n\nScott Barker and Charity Navalesi are former members, born and raised in The Living Word Fellowship. They are investigating this organization, founded by John Robert Stevens in 1951, that branded itself as a Christian church for over seventy years but turned out to be just another cult.

After having left the church in his college years but staying involved on a social basis because of family ties, Caleb re-entered the world of TLWF in the wake of Shalom\u2019s letters and was active in uncovering abuses, including leadership knowingly protecting pedophiles within the local Grants Pass church. Caleb also discusses his faith and how he discovered a relationship with Jesus for the first time in his twenties after realizing the beliefs he grew up with in the cult were not in line with traditional Christian beliefs.

      "description": "Kristy Pfeifer\u2019s family was part of the inner circle of The Living Word Fellowship and were members of an exclusive group created by Marilyn Hargrave known as The Purples. As a child growing up within this secret society, Kristy regularly saw behind the facade of John Robert Stevens\u2019 and Marilyn and Gary Hargrave\u2019s public personas. Kristy was a plaintiff in the recent lawsuits against the Living Word Fellowship and speaks publicly in this episode about her experience for the first time. In her deposition, Kristy says that she was sexually abused from the ages of 8-14 by two prominent leaders of the church, Marilyn\u2019s son, Rick Holbrook and his friend, Scott McDonald. When members of her family informed Gary and Marilyn of the abuse it went ignored and both men maintained their positions in the church until 2018 when Shalom published her letters. Kristy, having been out of the church for nearly thirty years, was immediately moved to take action and help bring accountability and justice. --- Support this podcast: https://creators.spotify.com/pod/show/oopsiminacult/support",

She found herself in an abusive marriage that ended in her being forced to leave everything she knew behind to protect herself and her child.

      "title": "The Living Word Young Adult School of Sex",
      "description": "In 1992 Gary and Marilyn Hargrave, leaders of the Living Word Fellowship, held a special meeting about the secrets and mysteries of sex in the Los Angeles church sanctuary. In this nearly four-hour long video, Gary and Marilyn spoke explicitly about sexual promiscuity, masturbation, homosexuality, Gary\u0027s flowing hormones, young children\u2019s \u201Cintrigue\u201D with sex, Gary\u2019s and Marilyn\u2019s investigations into the mysteries of intercourse, and directives on premarital fornication. This video was sent to the other churches in the fellowship. Meetings were held in these locations like Shiloh in Kalona, Iowa, and the video was played for high school age and up. For the first time we will bring to light this previously restricted video tape originally titled Gary and Marilyn Talk to the Singles, or as we like to call it, Gary and Marilyn make a sex tape. In 2023 Gary Hargrave, Head Pastor of Hargrave Ministries, was deposed in the Living Word Lawsuits for his responsibility as the leader of the Living Word Cult. In the deposition Gary is grilled by the Plaintiff\u0027s counsel about his teachings to the young people of the church. He is asked why he said, \u201CYou look at your five year old and tell me that they\u2019re not intrigued with sex\u201D. This begs the question, was this meeting priming the youth to be groomed and preyed upon by church leaders and members? This tape was recorded less than 10 years after the Founder of the Living Word John Robert Stevens died. Stevens was purported to have slept with numerous congregants and even divorced his wife so he could marry Marilyn Holbrook (now Hargrave). The whole tape is a lesson in grooming from Gary and Marilyn Hargrave who say \u201CMarilyn and I have a lot of sex\u201D and \u201Cwe use sex for a purpose\u201D. In attendance are all the \u201Csingles\u201D in the church including children as young as 13. Bonus: A not fun drinking game to try- Drink a shot every time Gary says \u201CBy virtue of\u201D and see how bad your hangover is the next day. Scott Barker and Charity Navalesi are former members, born and raised in The Living Word Fellowship. They are investigating this organization, founded by John Robert Stevens in 1951, that branded itself as a Christian church for over seventy years but turned out to be just another cult. Stevens demanded full submission of his followers until his death in 1983 and when his successors, Gary \u0026 Marilyn Hargrave took over, the beliefs and practices became even more extreme as they levied control over the congregants for the next three decades. In 2018 a former member finally spoke up after Marilyn\u0027s death accusing her son of abuse. There are five active lawsuits. The organization is a shadow of what it once was, but some remain believers of John Robert Stevens\u0027 teachings and many maintain loyalty to Gary Hargrave. Gary has a new following on social media and an active \u0022ministry\u0022 under the umbrella of Hargrave Ministries.

In this episode we go over court documents related to the recent settlement of these cases and reveal the details surrounding the complaints of two specific plaintiffs, and the judge\u0027s ruling on the matter. These two cases reveal common threads among all six plaintiffs and paint a clear picture of how Gary and Marilyn Hargrave and members of their Apostolic Company actively protected sexual abusers like Rick Holbrook and did nothing to protect children.

This deposition was done in connection with lawsuits that were filed against Gary and the church by several former members alleging they were sexually abused within the church when they were minors. Follow along as we read you some of the highlights of the deposition, where Gary is finally held responsible and forced to answer questions about his role, his knowledge of events, and the toxic culture he fostered for nearly forty years. See how after years of relishing his role as co-leader supreme, he now denies that he had any real authority at all. --- Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/oopsiminacult/support",

LuAnn also expresses great regret for not recognizing the abuse that was happening all around her, including her own, and uses this as motivation to help those affected heal. Scott Barker and Charity Navalesi are former members, born and raised in The Living Word Fellowship. They are investigating this organization, founded by John Robert Stevens in 1951, that branded itself as a Christian church for over seventy years but turned out to be just another cult. Stevens demanded full submission of his followers until his death in 1983 and when his successors, Gary \u0026 Marilyn Hargrave took over, the beliefs and practices became even more extreme as they levied control over the congregants for the next three decades. In 2018 a former member finally spoke up after Marilyn\u0027s death accusing her son of abuse. There are five active lawsuits. The organization is a shadow of what it once was, but some remain believers of John Robert Stevens\u0027 teachings and many maintain loyalty to Gary Hargrave. Gary has a new following on social media and an active \u0022ministry\u0022.

      "title": "John Robert Stevens | How A Cult Leader is Born",
      "description": "Before becoming the cult leader that we know today, John Robert Stevens was a disgraced Pentecostal pastor who had been stripped of his ordination by the Foursquare Church. Kicked out of two major denominations, having been accused of adultery and financial impropriety, he began to form his own church, which came to be known as The Living Word Fellowship, AKA: The Walk. In this episode we examine Stevens\u2019 origins and how he may have been inspired by the Pentecostal movement whose prominent figures included Aimee Semple McPherson and Charles Fox Parham. Pentecostalism birthed the Latter Rain Movement, which inspired cult leaders like Jim Jones, William Branham, and Stevens himself. Through it all we see how he was not unique in believing he was called as an Apostle and reveal the pattern that was used by so many like Stevens to enthrone themselves as cult leaders. Special guest commentary by John Collins of William Branham Historical Research. ______ Podcast Links: Apple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/oops-im-in-a-cult/id1703501829 Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/2YlZeTiuons5y4J3RZYXSv Support our Supercast https://oopsiminacult.supercast.com/ Contact Oops! www.oopsiminacult.com eMail - oopsiminacult@gmail.com Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/oopsiminacultpodcast More - https://linktr.ee/oopsiminacult ______ If you or someone you know has a mental illness, is struggling emotionally, or has concerns about their mental health, there are ways to get help.

      "description": "Marilyn Hargrave, the leader of The Living Word Fellowship was famously \u201Canti-woman\u201D. She perpetuated a system of misogyny within the Fellowship for decades. In this episode, we start by examining Marilyn\u2019s infamous \u201CGirls Turn it Off\u201D message, a principle teaching used to demean and control women in the church. We compare her teachings to the misogyny inherent in Christianity that dates back millennia. How did the Catholic church\u2019s teachings lead to the extermination of women through the Inquisition? Were New Testament manuscripts by Mary Magdalene and others purposely excluded from the Bible to eliminate women\u2019s voices? Why are modern day christian denominations suppressing women\u2019s involvement in leadership of the Southern Baptist Church?

The emails that Scott uncovered display how effectively The Living Word brainwashed their members into thinking that they were soldiers fighting for \u201Cresurrection life\u201D and how they should lay their lives down to fulfill the Founder John Robert Stevens\u2019 version of God\u2019s Kingdom. You\u2019ll see how the leaders, like Gary Hargrave, persuade the followers to not trust medicine and how his subordinates worked every day to ensure each member obeyed his Word.

From there he watched as leadership was expelled for not fully submitting to John Robert Stevens\u2019 teachings. As a teenager he experienced sexual abuse at the hands of a leader and a another member of the church. In later years he became a leader himself and was relocated to the Colorado church where he called out inconsistencies in the Living Word doctrine to Marilyn and Gary Hargrave and the head leadership of the Fellowship in a detailed letter. Afterwords he was immediately silenced, literally being told he was not allowed to speak in the church. Eventually he left the Fellowship and discovered his own path back into Christianity.

      "description": "Lauren Beckman was born and raised in The LIving Word Fellowship, her early life spent in San Diego where she was separated from her mother as a teenager and sent to be a live-in servant for her shepherd where she was physically, emotionally and mentally abused. In early adulthood, she moved to the Church of The Living Word in Los Angeles, where the abuse only escalated. Not only was Lauren regularly abused by Rick Holbrook, but she shares with us a traumatic sexual assault perpetrated by a member of the Fellowship, which was covered up by church leadership, including Marilyn and Gary Hargrave. Through all of the abuses she endured, Lauren was instructed not to tell her mother, report abuses to authorities, or seek professional help. She tells us about the lasting effects these experiences have on her and how she continues to work toward healing. ______________________________________  Scott and Charity are former members, born and raised in The Living Word Fellowship. They are investigating this organization, founded by John Robert Stevens in 1951, that branded itself as a Christian church for over seventy years but turned out to be just another cult. Stevens demanded full submission of his followers until his death in 1983 and when his successors, Gary \u0026 Marilyn Hargrave took over, the beliefs and practices became even more extreme as they levied control over the congregants for the next three decades.\u00A0 In 2018 a former member finally spoke up after Marilyn\u0027s death accusing her son of abuse. There are five active lawsuits. The organization is a shadow of what it once was, but some remain believers of John Robert Stevens\u0027 teachings and many maintain loyalty to Gary Hargrave.

      "description": "What is the truth about John Robert Stevens? Throughout the history of The Living Word Fellowship cult rumors circulated about John\u0027s purported infidelities and indiscretions, but these rumors were always excused away by the belief that his \u0022apostleship\u0022 outweighed the importance of any questionable behavior. His claims of time travel and having the power to cause the deaths of people he deemed nephilim such as John Lennon and the John F. Kennedy were among the many unbelievable things that his followers bought into. These excuses were perpetuated by his successor, Gary Hargrave. In this episode we delve into these topics and reveal our findings on one of the most recent and biggest allegations against JRS: that he plagiarized his manifesto \u0022To Be A Christian\u0022, which was the legacy of his ministry.

      "description": "What do you do when you realize that the church you grew up in was actually a cult? You make a podcast to talk all about it! Born and raised in The Living Word Fellowship,\u00A0hosts Scott Barker and Charity Navalesi discuss their experiences growing up in this modern day cult, conducting in-depth interviews with other former members and exploring the hidden truths of an organization that masqueraded as a non-denominational Christian church for over 70 years, at its peak growing to 100 chapters in 10 countries. In 2018, a former member came forward on social media with allegations of mental, emotional and sexual abuse within the church, spawning a movement of truth-telling that caused the almost immediate demise of the organization, its entire leadership resigning as more and more accusations of misconduct were revealed. In this podcast we\u0027ll discuss the history of the organization, its ultimate collapse, and the effects of its abusive culture and toxic leadership on former members. Adding a touch of humor, because if you can\u0027t laugh about it, it just sucks too intensely, Scott and Charity unpack their and others\u0027 experiences, how they\u0027re recovering from religious abuse and navigating life today, and the moment they realized, \u0022Oops! I\u0027m in a cult!\u0022. Hey, it happens.   If you or someone you know has a mental illness, is struggling emotionally, or has concerns about their mental health, there are ways to get help.

Only when Shalom Abrahamson spoke out was the leadership forced to respond. \nWhat followed was an unprecedented exodus of members from the church, many of whom reached out on social media to show their support to Shalom and additionally share their own stories of abuse from the church leaders. \nThis episode dives into the most telling moments from Shalom\u0027s letters, how and why she decided to post them, and the system of control the leaders of the church used to protect the abusers and silence their victims.\n\n\n\u00A9WalkDoc LLC\n\nDirector - Scott Barker\nEditor - Alex Ferris\nAdditional Editing - Scott Barker\nAssistant Editor - Shelby Stancliff\nEditorial/Graphics/VFX and so much more - Leah O\u0027Connor\nAudio Mix and Design - Dynamite Laser Beam\nCamera - Alex Ferris and Scott Barker \n\nPodcast Links:\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/oops-im-in-a-cult/id1703501829\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/2YlZeTiuons5y4J3RZYXSv\n\nContact:\neMail - contactwalkdoc@gmail.com\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/thecultdoc\nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@thewalkdoc\nMore - https://linktr.ee/thewalkdoc\n\nIf you or someone you know has a mental illness, is struggling emotionally, or has concerns about their mental health, there are ways to get help.

      "description": "A little behind the scenes look at how we hid the church from the residents of North Hollywood and even the 11 O\u0027clock news. \n\nWhy did Rick and the church want to keep the Tuck publicly separate from the church? Was it because we didn\u0027t celebrate Christmas? But then why would we do it at all if we didn\u0027t believe in celebrating Christmas? The Truck was a spectacular production that came at great cost and at no point did we share with the neighbors why we put this huge production on or that we were all members of The Living Word Church of North Hollywood and North Hills. \n\nHowever as members we were pressured into not only showing up for the 8 hour night of singing and dancing, but also to donate, work, and train for the big Holiday Parade every year for almost 35 years. \n\nContact:\neMail - contactwalkdoc@gmail.com\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/thecultdoc\nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@thewalkdoc\nMore - https://linktr.ee/thewalkdoc\n\nIf you or someone you know has a mental illness, is struggling emotionally, or has concerns about their mental health, there are ways to get help.

      "description": "It\u2019a a clear quiet Christmas Eve. You stand from your window and you spy the most wonderful thing! \n\nFor 35 years the residents of North Hollywood eagerly made camp on their front lawns awaiting the Magical Christmas Caroling Truck musical parade!  To some, this event, on the darkest night of the year, is \u201Cmore important than Christmas Day\u201D.  Families pour out of their home and sing along as The Truck passed by. Drinks in hand they follow the Christmas truck and its trail of dancing \u201Ccandy cane girls\u201D up and down the streets of the San Fernando Valley. After three decades, many residents can\u2019t imagine or remember a single Christmas without the presence of The Magical Christmas Caroling Truck. \n\nThis Holiday Parade recruited 150 volunteers including the dancers, the singers, the drivers, security, and of course Santa himself. Its sound system rivaled the Macy\u2019s Day parade floats and definitely beat out even the most outlandish of the neighbor\u2019s light displays. Bright and loud, the truck boasted that its creators and volunteers come from the Hollywood studios right down the street - Warner Brothers, Universal, and Disney.  \n\nHowever the truth, that was not advertised on the 11 o\u2019clock news, was that the volunteers and sponsors of the Holiday Christmas event were all from The Church of The Living Word in North Hills California. In the weeks leading up to the event they trained in a recording studio owned by The Living Word Church in an industrial section of North Hollywood just under the Burbank Airport flight path. The money that funded the Magical Christmas Truck came from donations to The Living Word Fellowship. And the creator and inventor of the Toluca Lake Holiday Truck was one of the head pastors of the The Living Word. \n\nThe separating line that was intentionally drawn between the truck and the church would keep many of the neighbors in the North Hollywood, Teluca Lake, Burbank neighborhoods from knowing the absolute chaos that was raining down on the this Pastor and creator of The Magical Christmas Caroling Truck. One October night in the hight of the #metoo era, a former member of the TLW church posted a damning letter that tarnished the reputation of Rick Holbrook (the creator of the truck) and the heads of the Living Word Church, Gary and Marilyn Hargrave. After reading the letters, members of the church began to post stories of their own further dragging these three Christian leaders down into the dirt. By the time Christmas came around members of the Living Word could not care less about the Magical Christmas Caroling Truck. \n\nThis is only the beginning of the story.\n\nCREDITS:\nEP 1 - Magical Christmas Caroling Cult\n\nDirected By Scott Barker\nCinematographer - Jackson Veigel\nAdditional Camera - Scott Barker - Alex Ferris\nEditing - Scott Barker - Alex Farris\nAssistant Editing - Leah O\u0027Connor - Shelby Stancliff\nAudio Mix - Dynamite Laser Beam\n\n\u00A9Walk Doc, LLC \n\nContact:\neMail - contactwalkdoc@gmail.com\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/thecultdoc\nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@thewalkdoc\nMore - https://linktr.ee/thewalkdoc\n\nIf you or someone you know has a mental illness, is struggling emotionally, or has concerns about their mental health, there are ways to get help.
