We talk about what she did once she realized this and the consequences of those actions. While normally on this channel we have discussed cult followers, in this episode we go to the other side to see what life is like as a cult leader.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This podcast does not endorse Jessica\u0027s End of Fear (EOF) Project or any part of the life coaching that she and Diego Fontanive are doing. It is my opinion that anyone partaking in non-professional life coaching services is taking a risk because this is pseudo-psychological work that does not require any professional training or licensing, nor does it have any oversight. Nothing said in this podcast should be taken as a recommendation or endorsement of EOF.\n\nJessica\u0027s websites: \nhttp://jessicaschab.com\nhttps://www.facebook.com/jessicamystic\n\nSHOP FOR CRITICAL MERCHANDISE\nhttp://shop.spreadshirt.com/chrisshelton\n\nMy book, Scientology: A to Xenu, is available here:\nPaperback: https://goo.gl/yYIl2t\nKindle edition: http://goo.gl/K51ySi\nAudio edition: http://goo.gl/1yvlYS\n\nSubscribe to my podcast at http://sensiblyspeaking.com or on iTunes at https://goo.gl/1QDUHS\n\nPlease consider supporting this channel and helping me to offer more and better content. \nPatreon: http://patreon.com/chrisshelton\nClick the blue Support button here: https://goo.gl/vHgSoE\nClick the PayPal button here: https://goo.gl/A4coS4",

The audio episodes are available on iTunes and at http://sensiblyspeaking.com.  Please subscribe and tell your friends!\n\nThere was some back and forth as to whether to setup a new YouTube channel to host these podcasts for YouTube or just post them here and I decided that I would upload them to my channel and create a separate playlist for these. Enjoy!\n\nYou can support this podcast as well as my YouTube channel on my Patreon page at http://patreon.com/chrisshelton\n\nYou can also use the blue support button on my channel\u0027s home page or the PayPal link to provide a one-time support.
