      "description": "Sometimes it feels like we\u0027re striking out against an invisible foe. Scientology locks themselves behind closed and locked doors, pulls down their blinds, and almost never tells the truth, especially about their own growth. They brag about all the new buildings but never about new people in their group. They brag about their front groups but never about their Clears and OTs changing things for better in the world. No Clear has ever developed a new technology, or medicine that will improve life. No OT has ever fixed anything with their supposed superhuman abilities, big or small. Scientology seemingly has unlimited funds for their defence as well as building their fa\u00E7ade of empty buildings and events, but are limited by their policies to responding as Hubbard dictated.\n\nOur words are our swords, and truth our arrows.\n\nLet\u2019s face it - in a street fight size does matter. In an altercation with a larger opponent, it will be worth knowing how to employ the right offensive and defensive strategies to overcome their height and reach advantage. Assuming you have no other option than to stand and slug it out, you\u2019ll need to be able to wear them down with superior movement and well-placed attacks. This type of situation can be quite intimidating, but if you keep a cool head and make the right moves, you stand a chance at coming out on top.\n\nWe can be nimble and make the right moves in our battle with Scientology.

This candid account covers my recruitment, the operations I participated in, and the eventual fallout. The whole operation consisted of infiltration by Scientology\u0027s Guardian\u0027s Office into various government, law enforcement, and other agencies. The purpose was to find and if possible eradicate files critical of L. Ron Hubbard. Most of those involved in this were later caught, charged, and convicted of their crimes.
