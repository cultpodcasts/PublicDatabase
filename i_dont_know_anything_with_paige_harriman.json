      "description": "So it looks like your girl became an accidental cult reporter! Many people are e-mailing, calling, and texting me with stories of their cult experiences and escapes. One potential interviewee mailed me a DVD with some interesting audio demonstrations, including one about how to become a cult leader. This TOTALLY BANANAS track shows how cult leaders manipulate, procure, and brainwash their followers. I hope you\u0027ll find it entertaining/educational! (I tracked down where this recording originated from \u2013 Mind Control Made Easy (or How to Become a Cult Leader), a film made by Cary Burtt (1999)! All rights reserved.)",
