      "description": "In the 1980s, Miami was not only a hotbed of cocaine cartels but also home to a quasi-religious Black supremacist cult that became a murderous criminal enterprise. Yahweh ben Yahweh (born Hulon Mitchell Jr.) founded the Nation of Yahweh in 1979 in Miami\u2019s Liberty City, preaching a radical doctrine that he was the son of God and that whites were infidels. Behind a facade of religious charity and community improvement, Yahweh ben Yahweh\u2019s group enforced strict discipline and espoused violence against \u201Cenemies.\u201D He built a following of hundreds, requiring absolute loyalty\u2014followers donned white robes and turbans, renounced their birth names for Hebrew ones, and lived communally in the \u201CTemple of Love\u201D compound. As the cult\u2019s power grew, Yahweh formed a secret death squad of enforcers known as the \u201CBrotherhood\u201D or \u201CDeath Angels.\u201D What followed was a reign of terror in the mid-1980s that few outsiders knew was happening. \n\n\nInstagram @topviralreporttv\nTwitter @toptrendreportv\nFacebook: Trend Johnson\n\nSUBSCRIBE \u203C\uFE0F\u203C\uFE0F\n\n\n*Copyright Disclaimer* \nUnder Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \u0022fair use\u0022 for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
