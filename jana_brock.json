      "description": "This video is PART 2 of my Raised In A Cult series. I was born into Armstrongism - a high demand religion many labeled as a cult. I was the third generation in my family to become a member. Herbert W. Armstrong died when I was 19. My entire childhood was spent adhering to his original, manipulative, controlling, isolating teachings. \n\nWhen I was 26, I broke free and so did my parents. My siblings were already out by that time. It would take several decades before therapists could help me begin to understand why I thought the way I did, why intimate relationships always failed and why I reacted so harshly to the world around me.\n\nThere is no way to measure how many people have suffered needlessly because of high-demand religions (aka cults) and their harmful teachings. \n\nMany bible-based churches are nothing like what I learned growing up. They are filled with good people who have good intentions and live good lives. If you choose to go to church,  hopefully you can find one of them.\n\nBe well,\n\nJana\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nThere is very limited, unbaised documentation about the early years of on Armstrongism - the orignal teachings. I was raised with those teachings. Many other families joined much later. As I said in this introduction video, my paternal grandparents were among the handful of people when the first church was founded here in the Pacific Northwest. My roots in this religion are deep.\n\nMuch information about Armstrongism is inaccurate or based on experiences of those who attended the church after it was so-called \u0022reformed\u0022. Some information is more accurate.

      "description": "This video is the introduction to a series I intend to publish about a very specific high demand religion. Since the leader\u0027s death, the church I was raised in splintered off into other churches. \n\nHowever, many family members on my dad\u0027s side went with the splinter groups that still adhere to the nonsense I was taught growing up. I know the people in this documentary about the original Armstrong church, which  my grandparents helped start: https://youtu.be/XLQRIUU9-9c?si=znYH3-e3O2hZV7ax \n\nThe documentary (called to be free) was focused on doctrinal errors. That\u2019s all well and good for the paid ministers who had to admit they were wrong, but it does nothing to correct the immense harm inflicted on countless families around the world - including needless deaths and severe, permanent disabilities of the people who were told not to seek medical care. And the trauma suffered by countless kids due to a long list of harm done to them in the shadows. \n\nThere is no way to know how many people have suffered needlessly because of high-demand religions (aka cults) and their harmful teachings. \n\nMany bible-based churches are nothing like what I learned growing up.
