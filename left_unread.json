      "description": "Don your ceremonial garb, fanatics, and once more drink of the kykeon. We are again descending into the hallowed sacrificial caverns to explore the nature of the mystery cults on the island of Britannia, and then we shall explore how the cults of the ancient world would give way to the rise of monotheism.
