      "description": "What a disturbing and sad case. Today I\u0027m sharing thoughts on Shanda Vander Ark and breaking down the tactics of manipulation, deceit, and dark triad traits seen in parents. I\u0027ll share observations I had from watching Shanda Vander Ark on the stand, information on parenting styles, and the common factors that link so many of the people who commit crimes and are finally taken to court. Thank you to one of my subscribers for suggesting this case.

Today, I am sharing with you the brave stories of Fran and Aubree of the The Farm Project MO who are here to illuminate the cultic and high control practices of a group called Harvest Home Our Father\u0027s Farm.

No one is immune to cognitive bias(es), but what happens when unhealthy and narcissistic cult leaders capitalize on this?

Join me as I explore more of the teaching of the Institute in Basic Life Principles (IBLP) teachings on attraction and how women are encouraged to navigate problems with their husbands. With so many high control, fundamentalist, and legalistic churches having high incidents of covering up certain horrific acts, I was curious to know what the teachings of these organizations are. Specifically, today, I\u0027m looking at IBLP teachings as I\u0027ve been covering Josh Duggar, but one thing I\u0027ve noticed, is that these type teachings permeate most fundamentalist Christian organizations in some way.\n\n\uD83C\uDF3BMental Health Merch: https://dine-in-psychology.creator-spring.com/\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/dineinpsychology \nBook: https://www.amazon.com/Live-Learn-Love-Real-talk-woman-ebook/dp/B07NJBLLSB \n\nCHAPTERS:\n00:00 Intro\n03:00 What is the IBLP teaching it\u0027s members?

Multi level marketing companies, otherwise known as MLM\u0027s, use many different tactics to draw in members. MLM\u0027s, also sometimes known as direct sales, or pyramid schemes even, often target people in an effort to increase their (the companies\u0027) own financial gain. The psychology of MLM\u0027s is complex. I\u0027ve always been interested in the study of human behavior, especially when it comes to joining cult like groups or MLM\u0027s. Modern, everyday cults can look a lot differently than what we saw with Jonestown or the Manson Family. But the truth is, many of the similar practices prevail: indoctrination of rules within the members, behavioral change, use of shame, and manipulation.\n\n\uD83C\uDF3BMental Health Merch: https://dine-in-psychology.creator-spring.com/\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/dineinpsychology \nBook: https://www.amazon.com/Live-Learn-Love-Real-talk-woman-ebook/dp/B07NJBLLSB\nPodcast: https://anchor.fm/rachel-ann-dine \n\nDISCLAIMER: This video is is NO WAY shaming people for joining.

      "description": "In a surprise turn of events, Elizabeth Holmes, former owner of now defunct biotech company, Theranos, took the stand and began her testimony this past Friday. In this video today, I\u0027m breaking down what exactly she shared, what was asked of her by defense attorney, Kevin Downey, and some of my own speculation on Theranos and the Elizabeth Holmes case. \n\nDay 2 and 3 of Elizabeth HolmesTestimony here: Elizabeth Holmes BIG Admission Day 2 and 3 Trial Update #theranos #fraud #commentary https://youtu.be/M9u9CMaiTaI\n\nA little backstory (please see link https://youtu.be/zb5gS38nBeE to watch previous video which details this information) If you\u0027re here, you most likely know the highlights from the Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos story. As a very quick recap, Elizabeth Holmes was the founder and former chief executive officer of Theranos which was largely touted to be the next major biotech company. She started the company at the age of 19 after rather famously at this point dropping out of Stanford university. Her overall mission in creating Theranos was to start a company that offered a more cost-effective efficient alternative to a traditional blood test. Elizabeth Holmes created Theranos which alleged that they had the capability to test patients for essentially hundreds of diseases and monitor bodily functioning with only a few drops of blood versus the standard regular blood draws.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, Elizabeth Holmes company Theranos began to fall apart. There was a Wall Street Journal investigation done John carreyou who reported that the Theranos claim to fame technology where only a few drops of blood taken by a finger prick-were not testing accurately or successfully. In addition to this there were several patients who came forward who had grossly in accurate test results and readings. \n\nBy 2018,this reporter John Carreyrou who first put the story out there for the Wall Street Journal ended up publishing Bad Blood and in June 2018 Elizabeth Holmes and her ex romantic and business partner, Sunny Bhawani were indicted on federal wire fraud charges where it was alleged that they were engaged in a multi million dollar scheme in order to defraud investors as well as a scheme to mislead and defraud doctors and patients. As of present, they both face up to 20 years in prison.\n\nBack to this video: In addition to breaking down Elizabeth Holmes taking the stand, I\u0027m also breaking down and sharing a very memorable witness that shared his testimony in the past week and what made his testimony so different from others.\n\nThis is a fascinating case of EXTREME and unethical \u0022fake it till you make it\u0022, fraudulent behavior, and individuals not necessarily being who they said that they were. When I found out Elizabeth Holmes took the stand, it spurred me on to begin covering her trial more so in full. She is supposed to be going back on the stand Monday and Tuesday of this next week, November 22 and 23rd so I will be keeping tabs on what happens. \n\nHave you been following the case of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos? What are your thoughts on her going ahead and going on the stand in her own trial?\n\n#elizabethholmes #riseandfall #commentary #analysis #theranos #grandiose #narcissism #lies #badblood #dropout #holmes #deepdive #forensics \n\nThe Rise and Fall of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos: https://youtu.be/zb5gS38nBeE\n\nPlease see the below resources that aided me and being able to make this particular video.
