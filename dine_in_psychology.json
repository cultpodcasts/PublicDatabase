      "description": "Hard to believe I have yet to make a video on the Dark Triad personality type but today I\u0027m sharing the psychology behind machiavellianistic, narcissistic, and psychopathic traits that go into the Dark Triad. From ways to recognize the dark triad traits, to a few tips for healing, this video heavily emphasizes machiavellinism but also touches briefly on psychopathy and narcissism. A long windy video to help break down the complex [dark triad] personality type and how each leg of the triad ultimately supports the other \u0022leg\u0022 of the triad.

      "description": "What happens when we hold onto a relationship or set of rigid teachings in a controlling, cultic group for longer than is good for us? What happens when a person may present one way, but function very abusively behind closed doors and why can it be hard to accept this (in some cases)? Today I\u0027m sharing some common cognitive biases that affect all of us from time to time. No one is immune to cognitive bias(es), but what happens when unhealthy and narcissistic cult leaders capitalize on this? I\u0027m sharing cognitive biases to be aware of and ones specifically that come into play in high control, authoritarian cultic environments, but also cognitive biases that can keep us involved in unhealthy relationships and investments for longer than we may want to be.

Gwen Shamblin Lara started this group under the guise of it helping people lose weight but it quickly morphed into a high control group. What makes a cult a cult? High control groups typically have characteristics that include: control, emotional manipulation, and encouragement to adhere with unwavering dedication to a set of beliefs.\n\nTake a watch to see the rise and fall of the charismatic leader, Gwen Shamblin Lara and her husband Joe Lara and learn the signs of spiritual abuse and emotional manipulation tactics that can be used.

Multi level marketing companies, otherwise known as MLM\u0027s, use many different tactics to draw in members. MLM\u0027s, also sometimes known as direct sales, or pyramid schemes even, often target people in an effort to increase their (the companies\u0027) own financial gain. The psychology of MLM\u0027s is complex. I\u0027ve always been interested in the study of human behavior, especially when it comes to joining cult like groups or MLM\u0027s. Modern, everyday cults can look a lot differently than what we saw with Jonestown or the Manson Family. But the truth is, many of the similar practices prevail: indoctrination of rules within the members, behavioral change, use of shame, and manipulation.\n\n\uD83C\uDF3BMental Health Merch: https://dine-in-psychology.creator-spring.com/\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/dineinpsychology \nBook: https://www.amazon.com/Live-Learn-Love-Real-talk-woman-ebook/dp/B07NJBLLSB\nPodcast: https://anchor.fm/rachel-ann-dine \n\nDISCLAIMER: This video is is NO WAY shaming people for joining.

      "description": "In a surprise turn of events, Elizabeth Holmes, former owner of now defunct biotech company, Theranos, took the stand and began her testimony this past Friday. In this video today, I\u0027m breaking down what exactly she shared, what was asked of her by defense attorney, Kevin Downey, and some of my own speculation on Theranos and the Elizabeth Holmes case. \n\nDay 2 and 3 of Elizabeth HolmesTestimony here: Elizabeth Holmes BIG Admission Day 2 and 3 Trial Update #theranos #fraud #commentary https://youtu.be/M9u9CMaiTaI\n\nA little backstory (please see link https://youtu.be/zb5gS38nBeE to watch previous video which details this information) If you\u0027re here, you most likely know the highlights from the Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos story. As a very quick recap, Elizabeth Holmes was the founder and former chief executive officer of Theranos which was largely touted to be the next major biotech company. She started the company at the age of 19 after rather famously at this point dropping out of Stanford university. Her overall mission in creating Theranos was to start a company that offered a more cost-effective efficient alternative to a traditional blood test. Elizabeth Holmes created Theranos which alleged that they had the capability to test patients for essentially hundreds of diseases and monitor bodily functioning with only a few drops of blood versus the standard regular blood draws.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, Elizabeth Holmes company Theranos began to fall apart. There was a Wall Street Journal investigation done John carreyou who reported that the Theranos claim to fame technology where only a few drops of blood taken by a finger prick-were not testing accurately or successfully. In addition to this there were several patients who came forward who had grossly in accurate test results and readings. \n\nBy 2018,this reporter John Carreyrou who first put the story out there for the Wall Street Journal ended up publishing Bad Blood and in June 2018 Elizabeth Holmes and her ex romantic and business partner, Sunny Bhawani were indicted on federal wire fraud charges where it was alleged that they were engaged in a multi million dollar scheme in order to defraud investors as well as a scheme to mislead and defraud doctors and patients. As of present, they both face up to 20 years in prison.\n\nBack to this video: In addition to breaking down Elizabeth Holmes taking the stand, I\u0027m also breaking down and sharing a very memorable witness that shared his testimony in the past week and what made his testimony so different from others.\n\nThis is a fascinating case of EXTREME and unethical \u0022fake it till you make it\u0022, fraudulent behavior, and individuals not necessarily being who they said that they were. When I found out Elizabeth Holmes took the stand, it spurred me on to begin covering her trial more so in full. She is supposed to be going back on the stand Monday and Tuesday of this next week, November 22 and 23rd so I will be keeping tabs on what happens. \n\nHave you been following the case of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos? What are your thoughts on her going ahead and going on the stand in her own trial?\n\n#elizabethholmes #riseandfall #commentary #analysis #theranos #grandiose #narcissism #lies #badblood #dropout #holmes #deepdive #forensics \n\nThe Rise and Fall of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos: https://youtu.be/zb5gS38nBeE\n\nPlease see the below resources that aided me and being able to make this particular video.

      "description": "In the Elizabeth Holmes Theranos trial day two and three testimony, Elizabeth Holmes made a major admission regarding the use of pharmaceutical logos from Pfizer and Schering-Plough. While in her 3rd day of testimony, Elizabeth Holmes copped to the use of these logos on her own documents without permission from either company, there were still many areas where misplaced responsibility ran rampant. Today I\u0027m covering and providing psychological commentary on Elizabeth Holmes\u0027 trial, specifically day two and three of her testimony.\n\nThe case of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos has caught the attention of many, self included. Join me as I provide psychological commentary in addition to the latest updates of her testimony and trial. This particular video covers in full big revelations from day two and three of her court testimony, As well as my own commentary on where I think her defense team and Attorney Kevin Downey may be trying to take the case. Day two and three of Holmes testimony on Theranos brought forth many new pieces of information including a major admission in addition to hearing Sunny Balwani\u0027s name brought up for the first time along with several other justifications as to why Holmes said she did what she did. Covering all those plus more in this latest video on the Theranos trial.\n\nFor a complete review of what\u0027s happened so far, I recommend watching (or getting caught up on the Theranos and Elizabeth Holmes trial) by watching:\n\nElizabeth Holmes Takes the Stand in Surprising Turn of Events! #theranos #elizabethholmes https://youtu.be/_UbKkA0Lcqo\n\nThe Rise and Fall of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos #narcissism #frauds #personality https://youtu.be/zb5gS38nBeE\n\n#elizabethholmes #riseandfall #commentary #analysis #theranos #grandiose #narcissism #lies #badblood #dropout #holmes #deepdive #forensics \n\nResources from today\u0027s video: \nhttps://www.npr.org/2021/11/23/1058019802/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-testimony\n\nhttps://abcnews.go.com/US/theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-owns-key-allegations-testimony/story?id=81368572\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/elizabeth-holmes-resumes-testifying-theranos-trial-rcna6341\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/23/technology/elizabeth-holmes-testimony.html\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/elizabeth-holmes-trial-theranos\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/11/22/elizabeth-holmes-testimony-live-updates/\n\nSay hi and receive more mental health resources! \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/rachelanndinecounseling/ \n\nPodcast: https://anchor.fm/rachel-ann-dine \n\nBook: https://www.amazon.com/Live-Learn-Love-Real-talk-woman-ebook/dp/B07NJBLLSB \n\nFREE guide to setting healthy boundaries: https://view.flodesk.com/pages/5efb890ccaabca0028b7b082 \n\nAnd don\u0027t forget to subscribe!
