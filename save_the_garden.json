      "description": "In this episode, Brooks Gibbs breaks down the latest twist in the fight to save South Garden Avenue from being handed over to Scientology.\n\nSave The Garden exists for one clear purpose: to stop private organizations\u2014like Scientology\u2014from quietly acquiring downtown public streets without voter approval.

Clearwater deserves accountability.\nAnd Clearwater deserves the right to vote on public street giveaways.\n\n\uD83D\uDC49 Sign the petition in person today.\nFind your nearest signing location at https://SaveTheGarden.org\n\nLet\u2019s change the law and protect our downtown\u2014together.\n\n#SaveTheGarden #Clearwater #Scientology #LocalNews #CivicAction #FloridaPolitics #ProtectClearwater #BrooksGibbs #RightToPetition #GovernmentTransparency",

SHARE EVERYWHERE.\nVisit https://SaveTheGarden.org\n to sign the petition.\n\nFor over 50 years, Clearwater\u2019s struggle with Scientology has never been about religion \u2014 it\u2019s been about real estate.\n\nIn this episode, Clearwater resident Brooks Gibbs exposes PROJECT NORMANDY \u2014 a covert operation personally written by L. Ron Hubbard to infiltrate, control, and ultimately own Clearwater, Florida. Hubbard\u2019s secret memos detailed plans to \u201Cdistinguish friends from enemies\u201D and \u201Chandle as needed\u201D in order to establish total area control.\n\nWhen the FBI raided Scientology headquarters in 1977 \u2014 the largest raid in Bureau history \u2014 agents uncovered 48,000 pages of secret operations, blackmail plots, and land-grab strategies. Eleven Scientology leaders, including Hubbard\u2019s wife, went to prison for espionage and conspiracy.\n\nYet the plan never stopped.\nToday, Scientology and its shell companies own over 200 buildings across 100 acres in downtown Clearwater \u2014 worth over a billion dollars. Now, they\u2019re trying to take our public streets, starting with South Garden Avenue.\n\n\uD83D\uDCAA Save the Garden isn\u2019t fighting against a religion \u2014 we\u2019re standing up to a 50-year covert real estate scheme designed to control our city.\n\nThousands of Clearwater citizens have already signed our petition to stop this takeover. If you haven\u2019t yet\u2014please join us.\n\uD83D\uDD8A\uFE0F One minute. One signature. One more shield for our streets.\n\nBut our movement faces pressure:\nFake names. Police calls. Investigations. Legal roadblocks.\nAll designed to silence ordinary citizens who simply want to protect public land.\n\nDespite it all, our volunteers continue walking neighborhoods, talking with residents, and defending the people\u2019s right to petition their government \u2014 a right enshrined in the Constitution.\n\n\uD83D\uDCE2 Together, we are reminding City Hall that government belongs to the people, not to a billion-dollar organization with a 50-year plan to dominate our town.\n\n\u2705 TAKE ACTION:\n1\uFE0F\u20E3 Sign the petition at SaveTheGarden.org\n\n2\uFE0F\u20E3 Encourage 5 friends to sign too\n3\uFE0F\u20E3 Click \u201CMessage the Councilmembers\u201D on our site and tell them: We stand with Save The Garden.\n\n\uD83D\uDC9A Your voice matters.
