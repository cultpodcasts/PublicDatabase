      "description": "Full documentary: https://youtu.be/_S9BUTM_Flo\n\nBarker ranch \u0026 Myers ranch are two of the key locations in the Charles Manson story. Although Spahn ranch is the most famous of the Manson ranches, Barker \u0026 Myers played a key role in the Manson Family. In this video I\u2019ll exploring exactly how \u0026 much more. \n\nScientology, Barker Ranch, Death Valley \u0026 more - What do they all have in common? In the full video I\u2019ll exploring all of that \u0026 more.\n\nIn 1967, Charles Manson moved to the Haight Ashbury district of San Francisco - The epicentre of the hippie movement. Particularly during the summer of 1967 (aka the summer of love) Haight Ashbury was flooded with hippies from across the world. These hippies would often experiment with drugs.\n\nMany believe this rampant drug use in Haight Ashbury was exploited and even perpetuated to an extent by the CIA, a dark wide scale experiment for the MK ULTRA program. At the centre of this theory is the Haight Ashbury Free Medical\n\nMany people believe Charles Manson was a CIA asset. More specifically, that he was part of the CIA\u2019s MK Ultra program: MK Ultra experimented with LSD extensively in  mind control experiments.\n\nLSD was a major factor in the Manson family: Charles Manson\u2019s control over his followers had a lot to do with acid (LSD). He would frequently give his followers LSD. Then while his followers were under the influence, Manson would repeatedly suggest things to them, over and over again. \n\nThis method of brainwashing people by LSD and repeated suggestions, was studied by the CIA. In other words, Manson\u2019s LSD brainwashing techniques were the same as the CIA\u2019s - One of several reasons many believe Manson was in fact a CIA asset - More specifically, that he was part of the CIA\u2019s MK Ultra program.\n\nAs of this posting, I\u0027m also preparing videos on possible connections between prominent artists of the 60s \u0026 the CIA, including The Doors.\n\n------------\nThe Doors, the FBI \u0026 Jim Morrison: Throughout the end of the 1960s until the early 70s, the FBI \u0026 President Nixon kept a close eye on Jim Morrison. In this documentary, I\u0027ll be exploring exactly what happened. I will also be exploring the history of the Manson murders. \n\nCharles Manson \u0026 Jim Morrison? The police questioned Jim Morrison after the Manson murders, I\u2019ll be taking a look at that and a lot more in this video. It\u2019s been speculated Charles Manson was involved in the CIA\u2019s MKUltra mind control program, that will be a subject for another video.\n\nThe Doors discography consists of The Doors (1967), Strange Days (1967), Waiting for the Sun (1968), The Soft Parade (1969), Morrison Hotel (1970), L.A. Woman (1971), Other Voices (1971), Full Circle (1972), An American Prayer (1978).\n\nSome of The Doors biggest hits include Riders On The Storm, LA Woman, When The Music\u2019s Over, People Are Strange, The End, Hello I Love You, Break On Through (To The Other Side), Love Street, Roadhouse Blues, Light My Fire, Love Me Two Times, Five To One, Waiting For The Sun, Gloria, Alabama Song, Indian Summer \u0026 more. Some of The Doors most famous concerts include the infamous Miami incident, the Hollywood Bowl \u0026 more. Icons of the 60s psychedelic \u0026 hippie scene. \n\nThe Doors were Jim Morrison, Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger \u0026 John Densmore. Pamela Courson was Jim\u2019s main girlfriend \u0026 the last person to see him alive before his death in Paris France in July 3 1971. They are one of the greatest classic rock bands ever.\n\nSome of the Rolling Stones biggest songs include Paint It Black, (I Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction, Sympathy For The Devil, Angie, Gimmie Shelter, Miss You, Anybody Seen My Baby, Start Me Up, Beast Of Burden, She\u2019s A Rainbow, Can\u2019t You Hear Me Knocking, Waiting on A Friend, Ride \u2018Em On Down, Wild Horses, Doom And Gloom, She\u2019s So Cold, Miss You, Can\u2019t You Hear Me Knocking, Baby Please Don\u2019t Go, You Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want, Love Is Strong, Like A Rolling Stone, Rock Me Baby, Fool To Cry, Living In A Ghost Town, Brown Sugar, It\u2019s Only Rock \u2019N\u2019 Roll (But I Like It), As Tears Go by, Under My Thumb, Jumpin\u2019 Jack Flash, Time Waits For No One. \n\nThe Stones current lineup consists of Mick Jagger, Keith Richards \u0026 Ronnie Wood.
