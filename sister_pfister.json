      "description": "A few letters from my mother, the first in 1997 and the second in 2000. Here we see a complete disregard for the actual facts of the situation.  She clings to the narratives she has been taught and the script in her head.. what is supposed to happen vs what has actually happened. So sad, and so maddening!\n\nThe worst is that there is tremendous suffering on both sides of this equation, and it\u0027s utterly pointless.  There is no reason for it, other than a predatory corporation masquerading as a religion that demands complete control. \n\n18 years later, this same game of gaslighting reel-me-in-then-cast-me-out crazymaking continues, except now I am her primary caregiver and financial support. \n\nNOTE: I am aware that i am pretty irreverent NOW, and I frequently mock religion NOW.. because frankly, I find it hilarious.  However, THEN, at the time these letters were written, I was not actively speaking out. The \u0022disrespect\u0022 and \u0022mocking\u0022 she references were simple disagreement and refusal to submit to inappropriate questioning.",
