      "description": "We reported on allegations that failings by the woman picked to be the next Archbishop of Canterbury contributed to a priest in her London diocese taking his own life. Tonight, amid calls for Bishop Sarah Mullally\u0027s elevation to the top job to be halted, we hear exclusively from a former safeguarding adviser tasked with helping to oversee reforms in the wake of Father Alan Griffin\u0027s death. \n\nBreaking a confidentiality agreement to speak to us, whistleblower Michelle Burns reveals her concerns that changes weren\u0027t being properly implemented, putting other priests at risk. And she claims that when she complained she was forced out of her job. And just to warn you, this report contains mentions of suicide. \n\n[Subscribe to our Substack newsletter: https://channel4news.substack.com/subscribe]\n-------\nGet more news at our site - https://www.channel4.com/news/   \nSubscribe to our Substack newsletter: https://channel4news.substack.com/subscribe \nFollow us:\nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@c4news \nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/channel4news/ \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/Channel4News \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/Channel4News/",

Pastoral support has been provided throughout for the second complainant and is ongoing. \n\nThe second complainant did not bring a Clergy Discipline Measure complaint within the one-year deadline. She later applied for permission to bring it after the deadline, which the Archbishop of York fully supported.
