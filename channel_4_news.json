      "description": "The Epstein files have already led to massive fallout around the world since their release - not least the arrest of the former prince, Andrew, the resignations of politicians and high-profile public figures and growing pressure on Donald Trump\u2019s administration, including his Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\nBut they\u2019ve also revealed the massive gap between what Trump\u2019s government claims and what is actually in the data. While Pam Bondi and the White House say the Epstein Files have been released, our forensic investigation reveals that up to 98% of the files are still missing. \n\nWe will show you the evidence that the Department of Justice and the FBI were originally dealing with terabytes of data, while the public has only been shown a tiny fraction of that.\n\nThis FourSight episode goes inside the chaos of the release process, where investigators describe the data management as a total nightmare. We show you the internal emails where officials admit they couldn\u0027t even open many of the largest files, leaving huge portions of the evidence \u0022completely invisible\u0022. \n\nWhile the government protects the names of high-level Epstein contacts, they have accidentally leaked the private contact information of victims. We dig into the mystery of the Epstein surveillance footage - despite proof of cameras in rooms across Epstein\u2019s Manhattan and Palm Beach properties, to date we\u2019ve seen just a single spycam video. \n\nAnd we break down how we found hidden media files buried in the DoJ\u2019s release of the files and explain why the fight for the remaining terabytes to be released represents another battle for accountability.\n\nAs the fallout from these files leads to the arrest of a former British Royal and the resignation of top executives at Barclays and Goldman Sachs, UN experts warning that the evidence points to potential crimes against humanity, there have been zero new prosecutions in the United States. \n\nBut we are still at the beginning of the Epstein scandal and with the release of these files perhaps a step close to true accountability for his victims.\n\n------\n\nPresenter: Kiran Moodley\nProducer: Anton Ferrie\nEditor: Matthew Lucas\nMotion Graphics: Ian Watkins\nSeries Producer: Kieron Bryan\n\nThanks to our investigations team:\nGuy Basnett\nEd Howker\nEmily Roe\nBrian O\u2019Flynn\n\nAnd to Tara Palmeri - https://substack.com/@tarapalmeri\n\n------\n\nGet more news at our site - https://www.channel4.com/news/ \n\nSubscribe to our Substack newsletter: https://channel4news.substack.com/subscribe\n\nFollow us:\nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@c4news\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/channel4news/\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/Channel4News\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/Channel4News/",

      "description": "Ever since Justin Welby\u0027s unprecedented resignation, prompted by allegations of abuse first reported on this programme, the Church has been in crisis. \n\n[Subscribe: https://bit.ly/C4_News_Subscribe]\n\nThe man currently leading the institution, the Archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, has already faced multiple calls to quit over his alleged failure to handle abuse cases properly. \n\nOur report tonight - detailing accusations of sexual assault and harassment - ratchets up the pressure, as we reveal Archbishop Stephen was informed of the allegations before the Bishop at the centre of the claims was enthroned in a more senior role. \n\nWe should warn you, this report contains some distressing testimony.\n\nTonight the Bishop of Liverpool told us:\n\n\u201CI have consistently denied the allegations made against me by both complainants. I have complied with any investigation from the National Safeguarding Team.\n\nWhilst I don\u2019t believe I have done anything wrong, I have taken seriously the lessons learnt through this process addressing how my actions can be perceived by others.\n\nI will comply with any investigation deemed necessary. I take safeguarding very seriously\u201D.  \n\nA Church of England spokesperson said:\n\n\u201CThe complaint was made after Bishop John had legally become Bishop of Liverpool. The National Safeguarding Team\u2026concluded there were no ongoing safeguarding concerns, but a learning outcome was identified with which the Bishop fully engaged. \n\nThe information from the second complainant was assessed not to be a safeguarding matter but a matter of alleged misconduct. Pastoral support has been provided throughout for the second complainant and is ongoing. \n\nThe second complainant did not bring a Clergy Discipline Measure complaint within the one-year deadline. She later applied for permission to bring it after the deadline, which the Archbishop of York fully supported. However, this was refused by an independent judge, the Deputy President of Tribunals.\u201D\n\n-------\n\nGet more news at our site - https://www.channel4.com/news/ \n\nFollow us:\nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@c4news\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/channel4news/\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/Channel4News\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/Channel4News/",
