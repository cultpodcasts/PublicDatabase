I have complied with any investigation from the National Safeguarding Team.\n\nWhilst I don\u2019t believe I have done anything wrong, I have taken seriously the lessons learnt through this process addressing how my actions can be perceived by others.\n\nI will comply with any investigation deemed necessary. I take safeguarding very seriously\u201D.  \n\nA Church of England spokesperson said:\n\n\u201CThe complaint was made after Bishop John had legally become Bishop of Liverpool. The National Safeguarding Team\u2026concluded there were no ongoing safeguarding concerns, but a learning outcome was identified with which the Bishop fully engaged. \n\nThe information from the second complainant was assessed not to be a safeguarding matter but a matter of alleged misconduct. Pastoral support has been provided throughout for the second complainant and is ongoing. \n\nThe second complainant did not bring a Clergy Discipline Measure complaint within the one-year deadline. She later applied for permission to bring it after the deadline, which the Archbishop of York fully supported. However, this was refused by an independent judge, the Deputy President of Tribunals.\u201D\n\n-------\n\nGet more news at our site - https://www.channel4.com/news/ \n\nFollow us:\nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@c4news\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/channel4news/\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/Channel4News\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/Channel4News/",
