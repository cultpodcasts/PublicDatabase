But since it\u0027s getting clipped and shared and reacted to, I wanted to fix the audio as much as I could, and remove the flashing lights that occur when the picture drops out periodically.

      "description": "Heber Jenzstch and Earle Cooley in an interview with Mike Wallace for 60 Minutes. The Church of Scientology brought their own cameras and a small audience to the interview, which Wallace is not thrilled about. It\u0027s an intimidation tactic the church commonly employed for press interviews. This tape is from one of the CoS cameras.\nI can\u0027t even begin to summarize all of the material that is covered in this video. You\u0027ll just have to watch it for yourself. It features some top-notch spin, deflection, conspiracy theories, whataboutism, and masterful straw man arguments. Basically, a church is above the law and any criticism whatsoever is an attack on the first amendment and freedom. \nHeber really was good at his job. His rhetoric is frustrating and sometimes infuriating, especially when he compares attacks on the church to Nazi tactics (which he does a LOT... right in the face of a Jewish person, no less).\nIt does have spots of video and/or audio glitch, but if you just ride them out, they are brief.\nSadly, the tape ends and I don\u0027t have the rest of the interview.\n\nHere is an upload I found of the final 60 Minutes piece, so you can see how they cut it together: https://youtu.be/eV-XvxQFADo?si=MA39RBtMrDQ_RdFI\n\nI encourage folks to take these videos and spread them around, whole or in part-- I only ask 2 things: 1. throw me a link and a credit; 2. remind your viewers that Heber Jentzsch, who gave his life to the cult, has been disappeared and hasn\u0027t been seen by his family in many years #freeheber \n\nEnjoy my uploads?

      "description": "Note: the two men featured in this video have been disappeared by the church and their whereabouts are unknown.\nOn Jan 29, 1986, the Church of Scientology hosted this press conference about the death of their founder, L. Ron Hubbard, at the \u0022LRH Museum\u0022. Featuring the following characters: President of Church of Scientology International Heber Jenztsch, Pres of CoS Los Angeles Ken Hoden, and a lawyer named Earle Cooley shouting over the phone.\nFollowing a comedy of errors of trying to get the speaker phone to work, Heber launches into some fascinating conspiracy stuff about Ron DeWolf (Hubbard\u0027s estranged son) and his lawyer (not that) Michael Flynn -- who they say is funded by laundered Rockefeller dark money -- and the evil cabal of IRS operatives who want to destroy the first amendment. They are very angry and defensive from the start and Heber is quite snarky towards reporters asking relatively softball questions about Hubbard\u0027s will being changed, the wait of several days to announce his death, his cremation without autopsy, etc. (Spoiler: They say he was exempt from autopsy for religious reasons. There is nothing in Scientology that forbids autopsy, to the best of my knowledge .)\nThis press conference is loaded with inconsistencies. For example, they say Hubbard was up and walking around and working right until he died. But they say the death certificate indicates the stroke occurred a full week beforehand. They say he willingly dropped his body and one reporter very sensibly asks, \u0022So did he WILL himself into having a stroke?\u0022\nTop to bottom, a fascinating tape -- from the huge old TV cameras to the 80s mustaches to Heber\u0027s visual aide, and of course the hot pile of nonsense that is the conference itself.

      "description": "I have a lot of questions about this short clip I found at the end of a tape. It is Scientology\u0027s Creston Ranch in San Luis Obispo. Did the ranch really look this crappy in 1986 when Hubbard died there? Compare it to more recent footage or google maps and it looks like a slum. This clip fascinates me! \nThere are people I could ask about this but none of them knew where Hubbard was at that time, as he was in hiding and this location was a secret to all but a few. So I don\u0027t even think I could find someone to confirm or deny that this is how the ranch actually looked then. It hardly seems like a fitting place for such an important man to drop his body. \n\nI encourage folks to take these videos and spread them around, whole or in part-- I only ask for a link and a credit please :0)\n\nEnjoy my uploads?
