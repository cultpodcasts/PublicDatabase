Her story is one that involves years of childhood beatings, molestation and the church covering everything up under the teachings that Jesus teaches forgiveness. She was sent off in the middle of the night by the ministry to live with the Bishops as she was considered a rebellious young woman, and never returned to live with her parents again. She was quite the scandal for doing what almost no young Mennonite woman would ever dream of doing, and broke off her engagement 2 months prior to marrying into an esteemed family a name.",
