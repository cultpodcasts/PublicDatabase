      "description": "A message for those who have been overwhelmed with sorrow inside or outside of Dwell. To the good Christians inside of Dwell, please consider Like Paul would do... confronting the selfish McCallum family for mistreating you in so many ways. Consider and discuss bringing the family  before the church the way they like it done and rebuke them before the congregation for once and consider getting rid of rigid controlling miserable ministry houses, stop humiliating people in detail in groups it traumatizes everyone but bullies that love it like the superbowl event at Xenos/Dwell that it is to them. Also consider demanding some basic privacy and rights as members especially your time and work commitments and start hopping around groups/nights/times take some nights off for no reason but self care and throw out the unnecessary micromanaged McCallums schedule for your lives thats the same as its been since the 70s. The McCallums treat you like worker bees with no respite and the selfishness needs addressed especially how they treat the grieving and abused spouses. Make that family give you respite and consider stepping them down honestly. You deserve better. Those who left and were humiliated you didn\u0027t deserve that and please dont be overwhelmed with sorrow anymore. You are a beautiful person and the selfish cult family never deserved you.  It is time for the family to start serving the church instead of the church serving them and they can start by taking some accountability instead of the same hubris since the two name changes ago back in the 70s..question their priorities the way they unabashedly question ALL of yours.

      "description": "Tip Of The Day From A Former Cult Member\nTrigger \u26A0\uFE0F  Sexual/adult content and LANGUAGE \nLike I say in the video I dont like this bizarre cult sex stuff topic but the weird cult family does so....\nA Tale Of Two Wankers\nThe secret storys of family hypocrisy in Dwell Community church formerly known as Xenos Christian Fellowship \nWanker 1: Dennis Mccallum founding member (the cult leader)\nWanker 2: Ryan Lowery Elder and son in law of Dennis. Ryan is aka the biggest bully in Xenos/Dwell and u will see why\nBoth are public figures who sell books\n\n I clap back at the bully cult leader for insulting survivors who leave their cult. The family has a bizarre voyeuristic version of communal confession that is horrific abuse and violation of members privacy while always protecting their own.\n\nIf you were humiliated in Xenos Dwell this video is for you. I hope you feel validated and know that it matters what happened to you members who are still inside and those now out of xenos/dwell. I CARE WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH \uD83D\uDC94\n\nI sat on this one as I have tiks in it and I rock so I\u0027ll go ahead and say that I have developed a neurological condition that gives me tiks and tourettes. It turns out u can get tourettes in your 40s. I try hard to only record when I\u0027m not tikky, but its hard when I\u0027m worked up. Im usually calmer in my former videos so I get animated too \uD83D\uDE06 hope this explains some of my speaking errors and struggles . I worked hard to overcome my speaking to make these videos to help people. I got worked up because I listened to a former members Emma\u0027s story on a podcast. She endured crowded ministry houses for over a decade and sacrificed all her time devoted to that place and they shamed her for just kissing someone and also for having a fun classy photo shoot session. It inspired me to bring this familys hypocrisy to everyone\u0027s attention in detail the way the family likes it. Lets not keep their cult secrets anymore the way that they don\u0027t keep yours.

      "description": "All credit is to xenosdwellisacult on tiktok.  I am in this video with several victoms of the cult Dwell Community church formerly known as Xenos. They did a great job. i am sharing their work here.\n\n\u0022Cliff Pervocracy wrote a column called \u201CThe Missing Stair\u201D, where he coined the phrase \u201Cthe missing stair\u201D as part of a metaphor to explain the phenomena of tolerating an abuser or harasser within one\u2019s community, even though their behavior was generally well known. In the column, Cliff compared the malefactor to a known problem with a house \u2013 something that was unacceptable and dangerous, but allowed to continue \u2013 such as a staircase with no railing in a dark basement that happened to be missing a stair in the middle. While the staircase itself is a known danger, everyone in the house has become so used to its presence that they just remember to leap over that missing step whenever they have to take the stairs.\n\nXenos refuses to repair the missing stairs and continues to abuse countless people. We will continue to use our voices to collectively warn people about the missing stairs until they are repaired. \n\n\n#religioustrauma #spiritualabuse #dwellcc #xenosisacult #dwellisacult #dennismccallum #leavingdwell #614columbus #ohiostate #cult #cults #cultsurvivor \u0022",
