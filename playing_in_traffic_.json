      "description": "On this episode of Playing in Traffic we are joined by Jordan Martino who now lives in Saudi Arabia. Her WMSCOG journey started in 2009 when she was just 17 years old in New Jersey. The cult took advantage of her young age and controlled every aspect of her life. We are so glad she shared her story and has found freedom. Some parts of the audio are a little scratchy but we tried to keep all of the content in so bare with us on those parts. We were speaking across the world to each other.

      "description": "Welcome back friends and family. Today we get into the history of the church. We talk about the Moonies, the SCJ and Toni\u0027s former church and how alike they are. We started a book club in this episode so grab your copy of Burnout and read along with us. Thank you Amonnie for letting us play your beautiful song on this episode. See the show notes for the lyrics. And stay tuned to future episodes where you will hear Amonnie\u0027s and many other fascinating stories. (The first letter of each word to the title of the song spells out the name of the church ) As a treat, here is the infamous dance video that Toni practiced so hard for. The song is an ear worm so I apologize now for it being stuck in your head for the rest of the day. https://youtu.be/_vYuESKvQQo Watch Me Still Continue On Growing By: Amonnie Russ (AMO) I had to turn around, cause I was in the wrong direction. A lonely path without protection while only using fear and guilt and not love to motivate me. Now I\u2019m trying my hardest to undo your damage, you took advantage of my obedience. Gotta reclaim my power, made my sweetness sour, then stole my flowers now I\u2019m replanting them Watch me still continue on growing (4X) Continue on Growing Continue on, Continue on Growing. You said I\u2019d be invited as a guest without a fee but never valued my heart my worth was measured by my deeds Said you\u2019d give me my sight, but your truth was blinding. Justifying your behavior while manipulating me. Watch me still continue on growing, in a field you said not worth sowing. No longer need approval cause I know it. I owned it, I loaned it, but you stole it! You told me I would change if I went astray, (If I went away) but now I\u2019m just awake and you were just a fake. (4X) You said I\u2019d be possessed, be love is my only possession. You tried to limit my perception, but reality is that the truth always was inside me. So now watch me still continue on to grow continue on to flow, and show love without motives.
