      "description": "As you may have seen, we were in ep 4 of \u2019Shiny Happy People Duggar Family Secrets\u2019 on Prime. We agreed to being in the doc, having been told they were looking to achieve \u201C360 degree\u201D coverage of the topic. They said they were not out to make us look like villains. That they wanted our perspective and to represent what it\u2019s like to be Christian influencers. For those who\u2019ve watched it, you can see that was not the case. Far from it. While I won\u2019t say absolutely nothing good came from the doc, (I do believe bad actors should be called out) they intentionally turned this into an attack on all Christians. An attack on Christian homeschool families. On Christian content creators. It came after us and many other Christian creators, some of which we consider close friends and great people. In this video, we\u2019re going into detail about what happened and our take on the docuseries. Here\u2019s our side.\n\nJoin our PATREON!\uD83E\uDD1D  \nhttps://www.patreon.com/paulandmorganshow\nVenmo @thepaulandmorganshow\n\n80 S*x Questions And Prompts PDF\uD83D\uDD25\nhttps://www.thepaulandmorganshow.com/\n\nThanks for being part of the P\u0026M Fam!!
