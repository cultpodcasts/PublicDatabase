      "description": "www.whatsupwatchtower.com\nTwitter: @UpWatchtower\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/whatsupwatchtower\n\nHello Everyone, this is our first official \u0022rant\u0022 video which we have divided into two parts.  We just wanted to air out some thoughts we\u0027ve been having in conjunction with recent headlines in the United States along with news in the Ex-Jehovah\u0027s Witness community.  Our language is a little more forceful than you are probably used to us using, but we feel very passionately about what we are doing and the importance of this moment in history, especially as it relates to the future of the Jehovah\u0027s Witness organization.",
