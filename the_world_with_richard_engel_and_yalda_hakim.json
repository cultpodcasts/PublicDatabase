      "description": "What is next for Iran? Did MI6 know about Peter Mandelson\u2019s past with Epstein? How does Europe bring Putin to the negotiating table? When he left his job in 2025, the former head of MI6 said that he didn\u0027t think he\u2019d left the world in a better place than when he was first appointed in 2020. But a lot has happened since he took the position, Sir Richard Moore has served two monarchs, four prime ministers, five deputy prime ministers and six foreign secretaries. He was also in charge of the security service when Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, when Trump returned to the White House, and during the upheaval in the Middle East with the war in Gaza. In this episode of The World podcast, Yalda Hakim asks him about the vetting of Peter Mandelson, how the war in Ukraine might end, and the new world order including China and the US.
