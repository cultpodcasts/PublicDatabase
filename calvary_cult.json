      "description": "These sources provide an extensive overview of allegations involving **abuse and systemic misconduct** within the Calvary Chapel network of churches, highlighting multiple cases where pastors and volunteers were accused of **sexual abuse, addiction, financial impropriety, and spiritual trauma**. Several articles detail specific high-profile cases, such as **Bob Coy, founder of Calvary Chapel Fort Lauderdale**, accused of child molestation, and **Rodney Finch, pastor of Calvary Chapel Cary**, facing unresolved complaints of drug addiction and financial mismanagement. Furthermore, the texts discuss the **lack of accountability** for leaders, often attributed to the Calvary Chapel\u0027s **\u0022Moses model\u0022 of governance**, which grants senior pastors almost absolute authority. Finally, one source describes the extreme and allegedly abusive conditions of a **persecution-themed \u0022Patmos\u0022 discipleship camp** run by an assistant pastor, further illustrating the pattern of uncontrolled environments within the movement.",
