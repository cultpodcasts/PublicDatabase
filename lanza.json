      "description": "The Darkest Internet Cult You\u2019ve Never Heard Of | 764\n\nFor the past 3 months I\u2019ve been digging into an online cult named 764. What I originally thought was just another group of weirdos quickly turned into a rabbit hole full of some of the most evil I have ever witnessed on the internet. There\u2019s so much going on with this cult and yet so little is actually known about them, so today we\u2019ll be digging into everything from beginning to now about the darkest internet cult you\u2019ve never heard of.\n\nThank you for watching The Darkest Internet Cult You\u2019ve Never Heard Of | 764!
