      "title": "Criminologist says social media can radicalize cult-like groups following arrest of Zizians",
      "description": "An expert on the psychology behind the rise in cult-like activity online is speaking out about the dangers posed by social media following the recent arrests of several people tied to a group known as the Zizians.\n\nMichelle Zajko, the woman accused of purchasing the guns used in the fatal shooting of U.S. Border Patrol agent David Maland, is behind bars in Maryland following her arrest earlier this week. Zajko, Jack LaSota and Daniel Blank were all arrested Monday night on multiple charges, including trespassing.\n\nThe three individuals are suspected to be connected with a cult-like group known as the Zizians. LaSota began posting radical theories online in 2016 and is now the group\u0027s suspected leader. The Zizians are known to be made up of mostly young, transgender individuals with beliefs in radical veganism, anti-artificial intelligence and gender identity.\n\n\u0022Some kind of core ideology doesn\u0027t have to be bad,\u0022 said Dr. Elizabeth Gurian, director of the Norwich University School of Criminology and Criminal Justice. \u0022But, it\u0027s when it tips into criminal violence, that\u0027s when it becomes a concern.\u0022\n\n\u0022I think social media, again, draws people together and in some ways allows people with very extreme viewpoints to come together more quickly,\u0022 said Gurian.\n\nSubscribe to My NBC5 on YouTube now for more: http://bit.ly/1e9vG0j\n\nGet more Burlington/Plattsburgh news: http://www.mynbc5.com\nLike us:  https://www.facebook.com/MyNBC5/\nFollow us: https://twitter.com/mynbc5\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/mynbc5",

      "description": "The Zizians have been tied to the killing of U.S. Border Patrol Agent David Maland near the Canadian border in January.\n\nThe leader of a cultlike group connected to six killings in three states was ordered held without bail Tuesday in Maryland, where she faces trespassing and other charges.\n\nJack LaSota, 34, of Berkeley, California, and two others arrested with her on Sunday appeared via videoconference for bail hearings in Allegany District Court. A judge ordered all three held without bail, describing them as dangerous flight risks.\n\nAllegany County State\u2019s Attorney James Elliott said LaSota has faked her own death in the past and \u201Cappears to be the leader of an extremist group known as Zizians\u201D that has been linked to multiple deaths.\n\nBut LaSota, who is known online as Ziz, asked for pretrial release, saying she was homeless with no means of traveling. Speaking haltingly, she also requested a vegan diet and said she was \u201Cin a mild state of delirium\u201D due to lack of food.\n\n\u201CI haven\u2019t done anything wrong,\u201D she told the judge.\n\nMembers the group, referred to by others as Zizians, have been tied to the death of a woman during an attack on a California landlord in November 2022, the landlord\u2019s subsequent slaying in January, and the deaths of a Pennsylvania couple in between. Most recently, the group has been linked to a highway shootout in northern Vermont, referred to by locals as the Northeast Kingdom, that left a U.S. Border Patrol agent and a German national dead.\n\nSubscribe to My NBC5 on YouTube now for more: http://bit.ly/1e9vG0j\n\nGet more Burlington/Plattsburgh news: http://www.mynbc5.com\nLike us:  https://www.facebook.com/MyNBC5/\nFollow us: https://twitter.com/mynbc5\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/mynbc5",
