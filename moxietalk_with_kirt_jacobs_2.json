His maternal grandparents raised his Mother as a Methodist until they converted to fundamentalist Christianity. His paternal grandmother was a fundamentalist Christian, and his grandpa eventually converted. Andrew\u0027s parents met at Hyles-Anderson College in the late 1980s; Hyles-Anderson is known for being a strict fundamentalist school.\n\nHis Father studied to be a pastor \u0026 his mother was going to be an English teacher. They got married in the early 90s \u0026 were excited to have children, but had difficulties \u0026 after contemplating adoption, they prayed about it until it finally happened! They had three boys, and Andrew was the middle child. They interpreted the birth of their children as a prayer answered \u0026 dedicated their children to the God of Christianity. Homeschooling was popular among fundamentalist Christians because of the separation from the world, outside influences, \u0026 total control of their children\u0027s lives.\n\nAndrew grew up in the Independent Fundamental Baptist movement known as the IFB cult at Gospel Light Baptist Church in Walkertown, NC, pastored by Bobby Robertson until 2018. \nRobertson was called \u0022America\u0027s Pastor,\u0022 \u0026 Gospel Light is one of the larger IFB churches in the U.S. It is known for its extensive bus ministry, bringing in thousands of kids every week.\n\nHis trust in his parents eroded and was forever destroyed; he read books constantly to expand his mind and overcome \u0022black-and-white thinking.\u0022\n\nToday, Andrew is an influencer who brings awareness to religious trauma and has shared his story on many podcasts. As of this filming, he works for one of the world\u0027s top cult experts, Rachel Bernstein, and helps her with her social media marketing for her podcast, \u0022IndoctriNation.\u0022\n\nAndrew is on a mission to pursue psychology to become a therapist \u0026 eventually, a psychologist by researching religious trauma \u0026 helping present \u0026 future survivors of spiritual abuse!\n\nRead Andrew Pledger\u0027s full bio \u0026 view the entire episode at:\nhttps://moxietalk.com/episodes/andrew-pledger\n\nABOUT MOXIETALK WITH KIRT JACOBS\n\nMoxieTalk\u0027s mission is to inspire, educate, \u0026 engage the human spirit one guest at a time.\n\nMoxieTalk, where we give you an intimate look into the courage, character, \u0026 defining moments of today\u0027s most inspiring individuals.\n\nMoxieTalk originated as Leadership Landscape TV, an interview talk show that highlighted the vision and influence of leaders and role models from diverse backgrounds.\n\nToday, MoxieTalk is a multimedia platform that continues this unique \u0026 intimate format worldwide.\n\nMOXIE: a force of character, determination, nerve, \u0026 ability to face difficulty with spirit \u0026 courage\n\n\uD83D\uDFE5\uD83D\uDFE5 Stay Connected with my social media : \n\nWebsite - https://moxietalk.com/\nBlog - https://medium.com/moxietalk-with-kirt-jacobs\nPodcasts - https://moxietalk.com/podcast/\nFacebook - https://facebook.com/MoxieTalk-with-Kirt-Jacobs-522484227916913/\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/kirtjacobs\nLinkedIn - https://linkedin.com/in/kirt-jacobs-ccim-8b19039/\nInstagram - https://instagram.com/moxietalk/\n\u2714\u2714Apple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/moxietalk-with-kirt-jacobs/id1200680411\n\u2714\u2714SPOTIFY - https://open.spotify.com/show/1ObcGk2RDsanwMLWcrQOwQ\n\u2714\u2714TUNE IN - https://tunein.com/podcasts/Education-Podcasts/MoxieTalk-with-Kirt-Jacobs-p1318578/ \n\u2714\u2714SOUNDCLOUD - https://soundcloud.com/moxietalk-kirtjacobs \n\u2714\u2714iHeart - https://www.iheart.com/podcast/256-moxietalk-with-kirt-jacobs-30963923/\n\u2714\u2714AUDIBLE - https://www.audible.com/pd/MoxieTalk-with-Kirt-Jacobs-Podcast/B08K56GZX9?qid=1631215234\u0026sr=1-1\u0026ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1\u0026pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f\u0026pf_rd_r=WH4PK82JDGM96JJ5S6T4\n\u2714\u2714AMAZON MUSIC -  https://www.amazon.com/MoxieTalk-with-Kirt-Jacobs/dp/B08K58DNTV \n\u2714\u2714PLAYER.FM - https://player.fm/series/moxietalk-with-kirt-jacobs \n\u2714\u2714STITCHER - https://www.stitcher.com/show/moxietalk-with-kirt-jacobs\n\n\uD83D\uDFE5\uD83D\uDFE5 Don\u0027t forget to leave a like/comment!\n \n\u2764\uFE0F Subscribe if you\u0027re new! \u2764\uFE0F\n\n\u2764\uFE0FPlease comment if you have suggestions on which video you want to see next \u2764\uFE0F\n\n\u2764\uFE0F Thanks for visiting\u2764\uFE0F\n\n\uD83E\uDEACAndrew Pledger\u0027s Origin Story-Cult Survivor/Content Creator",
