I\u0027m Brooke Makenna or Brooke Mckenna as some of you search (still love ya tho) and I create true crime documentaries from cases all over the world. It is my absolute passion to bring you these victims and survivors stories in hopes that they get more spotlight than the killers ever will. My true crime videos are not meant to cause any harm or disrespect to anyone I talk about. I do my absolute best to collect the factual information from online resources I can find. They are always linked in the description, as they deserve the credit and thanks\n for helping me create this video. Please feel free to correct me in the comments below on any mistakes made. I am never trying to spread inaccurate information. \n\nAny video clips/photos are used under Fair Use.
