Hill of the School of Oriental and African Studies with LondonNey\n \nFriday, 15th Aug 2014, from 6pm to 8pm at SOAS, University of LONDON, UK\n \nThis panel discussion will address the on-going \u2018Shugden controversy\u2019 in the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, which is surrounded by confusion, misinformation, and disagreement. While the Dalai Lama and many Tibetans have ceased to honour \u2018Shugden\u2019 and regard the propitiation of Shugden as problematic, a vocal minority, especially the New Kadampa Tradition (NKT) established in the West, believe the Shugden deity to be an essential component or Dharma protector of the Gelug School, and claim to be a minority discriminated against on religious grounds.\n \nThe community of Tibetan Buddhists has been agitated and are puzzled by the intensity of this dispute concerning the practice of the controversial deity \u2013 Shugden. Tibetans are generally bewildered by the actions of Western Buddhist organisations such as the NKT and their protests wherever the Dalai Lama travels, leading many Tibetans to become suspicious of Western Buddhist practitioners in general.\n \nThen, many Tibetans accuse the Shugden protesters as \u201Cdevil worshippers\u201D, \u201CChinese agents\u201D and \u201CTaliban Buddhists\u201D while the pro-Shugden protestors question the very authenticity of the 14th Dalai Lama, using slogans such as \u201Cfake Dalai Lama\u201D, \u201CMuslin Dalai Lama\u201D, \u201Clying Dalai Lama\u201D, and so on.\n \nThe purpose of this unprecedented, moderated discussion among experts and representatives from different sides of the dispute is to openly address this issue. The event is open to the general public with the aim of providing a better understanding of this issue.\n \nThe event will be live-streamed in order to provide the opportunity for far greater audiences.
