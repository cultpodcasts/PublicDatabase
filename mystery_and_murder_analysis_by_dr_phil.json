      "description": "Amy Carlson, better known as \u0022Mother God,\u0022 started as a spiritually curious mom but became the leader of a notorious cult built on sleep deprivation, forced labor, and financial exploitation. She claimed to be Marilyn Monroe, Joan of Arc, and even Jesus\u2014remembering, in vivid detail, being crucified. But how does someone go from a seemingly ordinary life to believing they are God? And how did it all spiral into one of the most bizarre and tragic cult stories ever told? Join Dr. Phil as he unpacks Amy Carlson\u2019s rise to power, her shocking beliefs, and the eerie final days leading up to her grotesque and tragic end. With firsthand accounts from cult members and expert analysis, this episode is a deep dive into the psychology behind cult leadership and blind devotion. New episodes drop every Thursday.
