      "description": "This video attempts to explain why a 30 year veteran of the Jehovah\u0027s Witness faith decided to start questioning its authority and teachings. \r\nJehovah\u0027s Witnesses, although generally sincere, are motivated by a misguided faith in the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, and not God. \r\nThe Watchtower places itself (under the guise of the \u0022Faithful and Discreet Slave\u0022) as an authority figure between Man and God.",
