      "description": "The concluding video, containing the 4 final chapters of Keith Valenza\u0027s book, \u0022How to Join a Religious Cult Without Being Brainwashed\u0022 (1978). Keith shares about his conclusion of time in the communal living with members of \u0022The Local Church\u0022 in Bloomington, as well as contact with fellow survivors and lessons learned. Cult survivors\u0027 experiences as well as research related to brainwashing and deprogramming may be helpful to any who can relate to Keith\u0027s experiences..\n\nMany thanks to Keith Valenza for writing and publishing this account, that, over 50 years later, is timely and comforting, as I continue to experience intentional deprogramming, adjustment challenges, the void of a primary community in which I grew up and raised my children... healing from over 40 years of highly conditional \u0022love\u0022/threatening/control/mind-altering practices and teachings that eventually required me to basically be a robot.... a requirement I couldn\u0027t meet, that forced me to look at everything with discernment, against the teachings that threatened me all my life not to use my mind, not to discern good from evil, to avoid anything that doesn\u0027t make me feel happy and light. Confronting cult dynamics is not easy. It is heavy and painful. That doesn\u0027t mean someone is on the \u0022wrong tree.\u0022 \n\n#witnesslee #thelocalchurch #thelordsrecovery #brainwashing #deprogramming",

It\u0027s hard to find the words for the message I am attempting to communicate. \n\nDisciples of Witness Lee MUST become cruel - and numb - to be faithful to him and his teachings, in contrast to those faithful to Jesus and His teachings. In this video I provide a few examples of disciples of Witness Lee who exhibit even to their own family members the opposite of love.\n\nThe more I process the traumatic experiences of growing up, being married, and raising children in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery,\u0022 the more I am convinced that you CANNOT be BOTH a disciple of Jesus and a disciple of Witness Lee. The two leaders are in opposition to one another.

I can\u0027t describe how joyful I was to be back in touch with Chris and Heidi. They don\u0027t live too far from me, and are still just lovers of Christ and the church - ALL believers. They stressed choosing joy and redeeming the time we have still on this earth. They had no bitterness - just thanksgiving and precious experiences of Christ over these decades we had been separated, after they were no longer welcome in \u0022the church in Anaheim\u0022 because they had been enjoying home meetings with John Ingalls, Al Knoch, and others who were considered \u0022negative\u0022/\u0022fermenting rebellion\u0022, etc....

      "description": "My 3rd of hopefully 3 videos addressing a few comments:\n\n@Ingman001\n8 hours ago (edited) wrote:\nUnfortunately, you don\u0027t really respond to the comments, even though they would deserve it. I deeply appreciate your commitment to fighting injustice and hypocrisy. But I have to ask: what about YOUR sins, your repentance? Don\u0027t you realize how much you are hurting people over and over again, just like all the other LC bashing guys? For example if you go to the grave of Philip Lee who touched you and say \u201Chere lies my sexual abuser\u201D. Do you ever think what you do to his family?\nI\u2019m so sorry. But if people can\u0027t forgive and spend all their energy accusing saints, the Church at some point must excommunicate them. That\u0027s righteous.\n\nSo... I will try to address THIS comment, now, as well as the comments Ingmar claims I didn\u0027t not really respond to, which are, again, shown below:\n\n@T_r_a_n_s_i_e_n_T\n1 day ago\n\u200B @InconvenientRuth  \u0022If certain ones said, \u0022I am in the church in Ephesus!\u0022 in contrast to other believers, Paul would have rebuked them. \u0022Is Christ divided?\u0022 Things divide. Christ unites.\u0022\n\n\u0022I am in the church in Ephesus\u0022 would be a statement of fact and a recognition of the only legitimate source of division: geography. In the same way that we cannot all live together in one city, we cannot all be gathered together in one church. It\u0027s impossible. What we can do is be gathered together to be the expression of the one unique church in different cities, which is precisely what the Holy Spirit did in the New Testament, what the apostles taught, and the matter that you are presently attacking.\n\n\u0022Anything made by man, including city boundaries and rules about towns and villages and cities being localities in which only one church can properly exist.... Divides.\n\u201C...those who make divisions and causes of stumbling include those who think they are better than others, those who put obstacles in others\u0027 paths, who practice hypocrisy, who teach things contrary to the scriptures or in addition to the Bible (extrascriptural... like the ground of locality - NOT a doctrine taught in the Bible)....\u0022\n\nThe Trinity is not a doctrine in the Bible either, but it is shown through Scripture. So too with the ground of locality, which is not a doctrine unto itself but for the ground of oneness which IS a doctrine in the Bible. But as for causes of stumbling and obstacles, what would you call this seemingly endless stream of videos you are publishing criticizing and \u201Cexposing\u201D others?\n\nYes, we are divided by man-made (apparently) divisions of locality but they are unavoidable. That\u2019s why the NT shows believers gathering together to be practically one with those with whom they live in the same city. Denominations, on the other hand, are patently extrascriptural, entirely avoidable, and far more divisive.

Don\u0027t you realize how much you are hurting people over and over again, just like all the other LC bashing guys? For example if you go to the grave of Philip Lee who touched you and say \u201Chere lies my sexual abuser\u201D. Do you ever think what you do to his family?\nI\u2019m so sorry.

      "description": "One of the 5 brothers mentioned by Dr. Hsu who were sent to Taiwan by Watchman Nee from Shanghai in 1949 was Herald Hsu. He wrote his testimony, \u0022The Testimony of God\u0027s Grace\u0022 which is 18 pages, and available at: www.johningalls.com/Herald-Hsu-Testimony.pdf\n\nThe \u0022Ground of Locality\u0022 or, \u0022Locality Law,\u0022 actually divides believers. Things divide. Christ unites. \n\n1 Corinthians 3:11 says, \u0022For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.\u0022 \n\nT. Austin Sparks believed that Christ is the foundation, the ground, of the church, and Witness Lee  insisted the ground of the church is its city boundary/locality. So Lee became very angry, and he refused to work with Sparks any longer. He shut T.A.S. out. Herald Hsu states that T.A.S.\u0027 ministry was just Christ, so Witness Lee was shutting out Christ. In making this decision, Witness Lee cursed Sparks, calling Sparks\u0027 ministry \u0022passing gas,\u0022 and he cursed himself, saying that if he is making a division, may he go down to Sheol mourning. \n\nHerald shares how Witness Lee repented before dying, in 1997. His coworkers/followers have not repented. They are still making divisions and causes of stumbling, insisting on a ground of the church that is other than Christ.\n\nT. Austin Sparks\u0027 books can be found at austin-sparks.net and, according to this 2004 letter, ordered for free from:\n\nEmmanuel Church\n12000 East 14th Street\nTulsa, OK 74128-5016\nUSA\n\n#livingstreamministry #thelocalchurch #thelordsrecovery #tasparks #taustinsparks #heraldhsu #witnesslee #watchmannee",

I wished I could record the words, spoken in spirit and sincerity, full of love for the Lord and for those affected, as we have been, by a system, to which so many dear believers have given their time, money and lives, that is riddled with hypocrisy, deceit, immorality, and cover-ups. \n\nThis video, as ALL my videos, is in NO WAY an attack on anyone or anything. God knows my heart. I just want to prevent the further stumbling of little ones, to be light in a community in which lying by commission and omission is commonplace, hypocrisy is a norm among too many leaders, sexual immorality by those in power is covered up in the name of covering \u0022delegated/deputy authority,\u0022 and particular men are worshipped. Anywhere these things exist, I am committed to speaking the truth, in love for God, for His testimony, for the church for whom Christ gave Himself, and for the world whom God so loved that He gave His only Son. \n\n#watchmannee #witnesslee #lilyhsu \n#thelordsrecovery #livingstreamministry #thelocalchurch",

      "description": "In this presentation, I share various firsthand testimonies about some of the scandals in the Lord\u0027s Recovery, centered around Witness Lee and his two sons Timothy and Philip. These scandals were hidden under a cloak, being labeled as \u0022storms\u0022 and blamed on other members of the church, many of them indisputably godly men, who were accused of rebellion, ambition, unforgiven offenses, and more.\n\nThese patterns repeat themselves, over and over, in this particular group (\u0022the local church\u0022/\u0022the Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022) and in many other Christian groups. Financial and sexual scandals are not new. They are in the epistles and the book of Acts in the New Testament, and they are in the news headlines throughout our nation. However, the Bible gives us the directions on how to deal with such matters. In addition to not bearing false witness, we must openly rebuke leaders who, based on multiple witnesses, are committing sins. We are to expose works of darkness. \n\nThose found sinning are commanded in the Bible to repent. To not repent is to miss God\u0027s blessing, God\u0027s gift of repentance. To not repent, we force others to live as if our sins are okay - and they aren\u0027t. To not repent causes confusion, suffering, and stumbling to others. To not repent alienates us from others and from God. To not repent often leads to false accusations of others as part of the cover-up. And to remain silent when one is aware of sins being covered up, is complicity.\n\nHere is a link to the book \u0022Speaking the Truth in Love\u0022: www.barnesandnoble.com/w/speaking-the-truth-in-love-stephen-isitt/1147464109.\n\n#witnesslee #livingstreamministry #thelocalchurch #philiplee #johningalls #alknoch #donhardy #churchscandals #wetoo",

      "description": "Having grown up without a drop of alcohol in my childhood home, but in a church community, which I considered my true family and with whom I spent a major percentage of my time (including in a school run by the church for a couple of years) that I now recognize as a high control religious group, I found as an adult that I could identify with nearly every point and characteristic described in the ACA program - a program for Adult Children of Alcoholics/Dysfunctional Families. \n\nMy parents did their best. They met, were married, and brought my sister and me into the world while missionaries for a conservative Christian fellowship until they found \u0022the local church\u0022 when I was 5 years old, and became 100% committed to that group throughout the rest of my dad\u0027s life, in spite of abusive practices including my dad\u0027s excommunication when he was only a few years into meeting with this group, and sexual assault that I experienced in my teens, at the hands of a leader who subsequently lied to my dad, denying a whistleblower\u0027s report. \n\nDue to strong teachings about the self being the enemy of the Body, our need to \u0022get out of the mind\u0022 and deny our feelings, our having no more choices because we lost all our freedom as slaves of God, submitting to spiritual authority (including my older sibling, as well as church leaders as deputy authority of God), etc., my parents, and I in turn, had no recourse when there were problems, other than to \u0022turn to our spirit\u0022 and \u0022enjoy the Lord,\u0022 turning the other cheek and forgiving (in spite of their being no repentance)... while seriously destructive patterns were ignored for decades.\n\nIn this video and hopefully in a series of videos, I hope to connect helpful principles I found in ACA to growing up in the dysfunction of a high control religious group like \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 which meets the criteria for groups that can cause religious trauma, as I discuss at the beginning of this video.\n\n#thelordsrecovery #thelocalchurch #livingstreamministry",

It also contains an article about the biblical mandate on which the letter is based (Romans 16:17), and an article \u0022\u0022that presents the proper understanding from the Bible that causing division constitutes heresy.\u0022 \n\nThis book would require many videos to properly address many of the claims in it adequately. I would love if others would also address these books, or if the comments could facilitate fellowship. \n\nMy main assertion from this book, as well as the other books in the series, is that certain believers who are the leaders in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 (TLR) treat anyone who disagrees with Watchman Nee or Witness Lee as someone causing division in the Body of Christ, and worthy of being marked, turned away from, and not interacted with by other believers. The only explanation for this is that \u0022The Body\u0022 in their view IS the Lord\u0027s Recovery, and Watchman Nee and Witness Lee are the ministers of the age whose ministry IS the healthy teaching and the New Testament Ministry, exclusive of any other ministers\u0027 portions that don\u0027t fully align with and support their ministry. \u0022The blended brothers\u0022 in TLR MUST agree with the entirety of Witness Lee and Watchman Nee\u0027s ministry, or be called heretics, divisive, and be marked and turned away from by their entire church community. \n\nThe letters that have been written by these brothers who are being quarantined are not provided; Christians are told not to interact with these brothers nor to read anything they have written. Without being able to view the documents firsthand, it is hard to make a judgment between/among brothers who don\u0027t agree, and it is easy to misrepresent fellow believers, to manipulate a narrative and thereby to manipulate followers to mistreat fellow believers who don\u0027t agree with leaders,.\n\n#thelordsrecovery #thelocalchurch #livingstreamministry #blendedbrothers #tituschu #witnesslee #watchmannee",

If we are to mark those who make divisions and causes of stumbling, I don\u0027t see how an honest look at the history and the facts can allow any proper believer to not mark leaders in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 as actually making divisions and causes of stumbling. Whistleblowers are not the cause of the problems they are exposing. They are not \u0022making divisions and causes of stumbling\u0022 by expressing concerns about divisions and causes of stumbling.\n\n#lordsrecovery #thelordsrecovery #thelocalchurch #witnesslee",

      "description": "After sharing in my last video some of the books our family collected over the years, I decided to read the books we have, in the series: \u0022A Faithful Word: A Warning to Quarantine Divisive Workers.\u0022 Book 2 of that series (I can\u0027t find Book 1) is entitled, \u0022From Such Turn Away.\u0022 This series is published by Defense and Confirmation Project (DCP), 2007.\n\nMy observations in reading this book are that, in Witness Lee/DCP/writers\u0027 attitude:\n\n1. The Lord\u0027s Recovery seems to be equivalent to the Body of Christ.\n\n2. No one should go to coffee shops to fellowship - if anyone asks you to go to a coffee shop or tea house, don\u0027t follow that person anymore (p. 20, 28...). Here is a quote I did not include in the video, from p. 28:\n\u0022Even though I was very close to Watchman Nee, there was never any kind of talk between us concerning who would be his successor, nor did we go to a restaurant together.... How could you do that? What you did mars the Lord\u0027s recovery and damages the temple of God. Going to the coffee shop is of the flesh.\u0022\n\n3. One publication is key to the oneness of the Body of Christ.\n\n4. Titus Chu is condemned for many things (that I have observed in those who condemn him).\n\n... and much more.\n\n#thelordsrecovery #onepublication #witnesslee #tituschu #thelocalchurch",

      "description": "I have never been sold any item nor have I had any product or book marketed EVER at any other church congregation outside  \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery\u201D. And I have attended many over the past few years\u2026 and I have been truly cared for and fed - with no attempt to sell me anything. \n\nAs I looked through a mere sampling of Living Stream Ministry books I store in our office (a very small fraction of all our LSM books collected over the years), I thought to try to share my perspective with viewers. \n\nIf someone in \u201Cthe Lord\u2019s Recovery\u201D (\u201CTLR\u201D) is not ordering Holy Word for Morning Revival, not reading the Life-Studies, not subscribing to Living Stream Ministry, s/he will likely feel or be left out, and churches not subscribing to this publishing company are not considered legitimate churches. These LSM books are sold at a much higher cost than their printing costs\u2026. \n\nAny member in TLR who shares from another publication, or who publishes their ministry, will likely be labeled by the \u201Cblended co-workers\u201D as divisive, speaking perverted things, drawing people after themselves, etc. This and much more is printed in\u2026 LSM publications. \n\nIn \u201Cother\u201D (non-LSM affiliated) churches (non-profit settings), I have NEVER once been marketed or sold a book published by a company affiliated with the church. \n\nThere\u2019s so much more to be said about this. One video barely scratches the surface.\n\nFor fellowship in the light, and reflective consideration, I post this video and these points/words from the Bible:\n\nJesus never charged money for his speaking. The apostles never charged money. Paul said, in 2 Cor. 2:17, \u201CWe do not preach for personal profit.\u201D \n\nThe love of money is a root of all evil. Some consider godliness a means to financial gain\u2026 (First Letter from Paul to Timothy)\n\nUngodly infiltrators into the church rush for profit into Balaam\u2019s error. (Jude)\n\nJesus said that we freely received and should freely give. (Matt. 10:8) \n\nJesus\u2019 grace is that though He was rich, He  became poor for our sake. (2 Cor. 8:9)\n\nFlee these things. 1 Tim. 6:11\n\nWitness Lee is listed as the author of around 1000 books [nearly all, or all, printed versions of his spoken messages... printed by a publication company that he founded, and which his son Philip managed, and which financially made their family very wealthy after many failed business attempts. I got this figure from Samuel Liu in this clip from an International Training of Elders and Responsible Ones in 2017... in which Samuel Liu is soliciting testimonies about how wonderful \u0022The Ministry\u0022 is... telling \u0022saints\u0022 to post their stories about the wonderfulness of Living Stream publications on the internet: how it can make you literate in English, that Life-Studies save marriages (not the Bible, or the Lord, or proper character....). He is promoting LSM publications - which are for purchase.

      "description": "I mainly share a few helpful, healthy, and insightful words from a dear sister, Mary Demuth, written in her book We Too: How the Church Can Respond Redemptively to the Sexual Abuse Crisis (2024), particularly words that stood out to me as a survivor of sexual abuse at the hands of the then-manager of the Living Stream Ministry, Philip Lee. I found this book to be a real balm to my heart, as well as very insightful related to understanding abuse, especially in church settings, and ways to help one another. \n\nI highly recommend this book as a resource for every believer - especially any who have suffered from abuse... oh, wait... that is all of us, because when one member suffers, we ALL suffer. \n\nIn her last chapter, Mary writes, \u0022Because of the enduring legacy of that trauma, I wrote this book. I am a wounded healer who longs to see the church rise up into itself and do the unheralded but necessary work of burden bearing. In so many ways, the church as been a blessing to me..... They are all the body of Christ being the hands and feet of Jesus to me....\n\n\u0022.... But God, who has faithfully borne my burden.... occupies all the difficult spaces humanity has endured. While I can\u0027t fully reconcile the problem of evil and why so many people have been sexually violated over the centuries, I do know this: Jesus has wept alongside me, and he weeps for his church to rise up valiantly and love the least, the last, and the lost. This is our We Too moment, to purposefully suffer alongside the sexually broken.\u0022\n\n[One important point made in this book, that I forgot to read aloud, is on page 92 - the difference between sin and crime: \u0022... sin separates us from a holy God, but crime separates us from law-abiding society.... We can offer grace to our brothers and sisters who commit crimes, but that grace is best given in the context of justice being administered by the appropriate authorities....\u0022\n\nThanks to Mary Demuth for sharing her own story, along with many stories from the Bible and from church history, including modern (recent) history, as well as offering so many words of genuine comfort and healing for the Body of Christ.\n\n#marydemuth #wetoo #lordsrecovery #thelordsrecovery #thelocalchurch #churchabuse",

      "description": "Yesterday I had the indescribable privilege of being online with some who knew Don Hardy, including his wife and children, as well as believers who had known him since the 50\u0027s, 60\u0027s, 70\u0027s, 80\u0027s, and more recently. His life magnified Christ, his living was a testimony of the Scriptures he had hidden in his heart, many since time he spent with the Navigators as a teenager. Although he was ousted from eldership in Rosemead after catching Philip Lee in adultery, he continued on with the Lord. The time yesterday, remembering Don and glorifying God because of Christ whom he loved and served and expressed in his life, had the distinct characteristics of Philadelphia. True brotherly love. Having a little power. Keeping the Lord\u0027s Word. Not denying the Lord\u0027s name. \n\nThe sense I had with fellow believers online yesterday was in stark contrast to the sense I now have about \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery,\u0022 where there is a boast of reaching \u0022the high peak\u0022 and having \u0022the ministry of the age,\u0022 where many members are more faithful to Witness Lee than to their spouses and to the Lord\u0027s Word. Some are more loyal to Witness Lee\u0027s name than to the Lord\u0027s name. I am reminded of Laodicea in Revelation 3, where members say, \u2018I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.\u2019 But they do not realize that they are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked.... The Lord says to Laodicea: \u0022Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest and repent.  Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me. To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to sit with me on my throne, just as I was victorious and sat down with my Father on his throne. Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.\u201D (Rev. 3: 14-22)\n\nBe earnest. Repent. Don\u0027t be wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked and think that you are rich and without need. The Lord is NOT where there are lies and adultery and the uplifting of Philip Lee, Witness Lee, blended brothers or anyone else except Jesus only. Jesus is not where there is evil treatment of His sheep. God is not pleased with the abuse of His children. Jesus is where there is love, His Word, and His Name uniquely praised.\n\n#thelordsrecovery #livingstreamministry #donhardy #witnesslee #thelocalchurch",

He no longer agrees with the then-recent excommunication of multiple believers and even of churches, and he has sincere questions. Simply expressing disagreement or having questions could each be enough to get someone labeled as rebellious (leprous, dead, untouchable, rebellious, causing division.....) and banished.\n\nWhat a loss.

There is no fellowship between those who speak truth and those who are taught to avoid the truth (framing the truth as poison, evil speaking, etc.) \n\nDue to a pervasiveness of lies, an intolerance for the truth, and other defrauding practices, some family members, including a widow and her fatherless child I mention in this video, who have identified all their lives as being \u0022in the Lord\u0027s Recovery,\u0022 are having to seek legal help from the judicial system. The late husband/father\u0027s family, in leadership roles in \u0022the Lord\u0027s Recovery,\u0022 have sought to defraud the widow and her child from their property. This is evil. And it is one of many examples of shameful mistreatment of the vulnerable and oppressed. It is tragic that such behavior can occur among believers, and the church does not properly judge, as instructed by Paul in 1 Cor. 5:12 (\u0022... you must judge those who are part of your group.\u0022).\n\nHopefully in the law courts, to which I, this widow, and others are appealing, truth is heard, lies are exposed, and justice rain down. \n\nAmos 5:24: \u0022But let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.\u0022",

      "description": "How does your church\u0027s leadership and congregation respond when someone expresses a concern, or reports a leader\u0027s wrongdoing,? If the initial reaction is sincerity, urgency, and transparency, the church culture may be healthy. \n\nIf the reaction of your church leadership is stonewalling, silencing, denial, deflection, offering a counternarrative, isolating and/or accusing the one expressing concern or reporting wrongdoing as \u0022attacking,\u0022 as being \u0022rebellious,\u0022 as \u0022not covering,\u0022 or even as being satanic (accusing the brethren) or someone \u0022of death\u0022..... the culture of your church is TOXIC. Poisonous. Insidiously unhealthy. \n\nA church with a toxic culture is likely led, at least in part, by narcissists and sycophants, who care more for their image and for the image of their organization that reflects on them, than they care for the truth, for the gospel, and for the marginalized: the powerless, oppressed, exploited, abused, and wounded. \n\nPower actually corrupts the brain. \u0022Subjects under the influence of power... acted as if they had suffered traumatic brain injury - becoming more impulsive, less risk-aware, and crucially, less adept at seeing things from others\u0027 point of view. ... pwer, in fact, impairs a specific neural process, \u0022mirroring,\u0022 that may be the cornerstone of empathy\u0022 (p. 33 of \u0022A Church Called Tov\u0022). \n\nIn this video, I share some highlights from Part 1 of the book \u0022A Church Called Tov\u0022 by Scot McKnight and Laura Barringer (2020), reflecting minimally on my own experiences and observations in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 and encouraging listeners to reflect on the healthy, enlightening, loving words in this book, to determine the level of health or of toxicity in your own church\u0027s culture.\n\n#thelocalchurch #livingstreamministry #witnesslee #thelordsrecovery #restore2025 #achurchcalledtov",

He believed that some of his wrongheaded ideas had gotten support due to this flaw in the American character and that he needed to be careful not to take advantage of this weakness...\u0022\n\nYet, \u0022the root of all the troubles among us today,\u0022 Witness Lee said in January 1989, is with some of his older coworkers (ones who brought up concerns to him about immorality, coercive control practices of the Living Stream Office, financial corruption, etc.) \u0022The problem among us is this: there is a kind of consideration among the older co-workers, not all, but some. There was a kind of consideration -Where shall they be? Brother Lee was the one who brought the recovery to this country and was the one who through the Lord\u2019s ministry brought many of the older co-workers into the recovery. But now this one who brought the recovery to this country is seemingly deviating. Deviating from what? Into what? That\u2019s right, deviating from the old into the new. Now some of the co-workers have to consider where they should be. Shall they remain in the old, or shall they go forth into the new? Go forth? To say this is easy. You have to pay a price, especially the older ones. They have made a success in the recovery according to the old way, but now the old way was annulled. Then what shall we do? If you were them, surely you would consider.I must tell you, this is the root of all the troubles among us today. All the other things are on the surface; the root is here. Now you know.\u201D\n\nI also share a Ministry Watch rating of Living Stream Ministry, with a \u0022Withhold Giving\u0022 recommendation based on various objective measurements. See: ministrywatch.com/ministry-spotlight-living-stream-ministry/ and db.ministrywatch.com/ministry.php?ein=237031637. In \u0022Transparency and Accountability\u0022 the Living Stream Ministry earned a D.\n\nAnd, if Brother Don Rutledge sees this, I hope to meet you someday soon, brother!!! Thank you for your firsthand testimony that is so helpful to us trying to understand and make sense of a group that lacks transparency, accountability, willingness to answer questions and fellowship, and is dishonest about the past.\n\n#livingstreamministry #thelordsrecovery #thelocalchurch #witnesslee",

      "description": "In this video, I read Appendix B of \u0022In the Wake of the New Way\u0022 which shares the distress of one sister whose marriage is disregarded by elders and her husband in the context of her husband\u0027s \u0022oneness\u0022 with \u0022the ministry\u0022 and the wife\u0027s discouragement in \u0022the church life\u0022 which led her to being labeled \u0022an opposer\u0022, even by her own husband. This example is just one of countless stories, and has devastating ramifications, not only on individuals and marriages, but on children and extended family relationships, on the church as the Body of Christ, and on society as a whole. Families are \u0022the most important... actor in the production of health\u0022 (NIH). \n\nBecause some members in \u0022the church\u0022 may condemn divorce but not condemn loveless marriages, I also mention the history of the certificate of divorce, in Deuteronomy 24, that it is meant to be a provision to a wife whose husband no longer wants her. I argue that although this is cruel, and God hates divorce, it is more cruel and hateful to force a wife to be legally bound to a husband who is abusive, who no longer wants her, and/or who does not care for her as his wife. \n\n#witnesslee #thelordsrecovery #thelocalchurch #livingstreamministry",

      "description": "I have a burden to read Steve Isitt\u0027s first booklet, \u0022In the Wake of the New Way,\u0022 on video - it will take several episodes. A main reason I want to read his booklet is because, if as the church we are meant to judge in conflicts among believers, it is important to know the important and relevant facts. After Steve wrote \u0022In the Wake of the New Way,\u0022 he wrote to Dan Towle, hoping to fellowship with him. He never heard back from Dan, but instead was banned from the two local churches in his area, by an elder, Sherman Robertson, who, having been \u0022informed more or less\u0022 of the contents of the booklet and demanded that if Steve wanted to be \u0022restored to the fellowship of the churches,\u0022 Steve must make \u0022a complete and thorough point by point apology and retraction of every item mentioned there.\u0022 \n\nIn this video, I read Steve\u0027s appeal, written to the leaders in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022, which includes responses from one of only two leaders from whom he has ever heard back anything at all, in spite of many pleas for fellowship. \n\nThis appeal, including the condemning of Steve Isitt, is the backdrop for my reading of Steve\u0027s booklet, \u0022In the Wake of the New Way,\u0022 which I hope to read at least some of, online, this weekend. \n\nAs the church, we are to judge when there are conflicts between believers. Steve has been mistreated for 25 years now, and others even longer.  I hope the fellowship - or attempt to fellowship - represented in Steve\u0027s appeal, helps the church to judge righteously in this matter.\n\n#thelocalchurch #thelordsrecovery #livingstreamministry #witnesslee #shermanrobertson",

      "description": "Abuse includes destroying a group member\u0027s network by smearing them as an evil person, when their heart and actions are genuinely for their community. \n\nSteve Isitt didn\u0027t start out as a whistleblower - he started out as a concerned brother in Christ who noticed many, including his wife, losing heart and no longer participating in their church community, during a transition referred to as \u0022The New Way\u0022. When he studied the matter, and found clear discrepancies between what was taught and what was being practiced, he offered his studies to fellow responsible ones in his church, only to be called an opposer and his writings an attack. He was told unless he retracts everything he wrote, he could not return to the gatherings of believers he so loved. He can\u0027t retract what he knows to be true, and in his exile, he has learned from many who have been similarly abused. \n\nAfter being falsely spoken against publicly, Steve sought fellowship with the public speaker, Ron Kangas. Ron then has referred to Steve\u0027s attempts to clear matters up between them, and then through the legal system, as further attack, slander, reviling.... Ron used a technique referred to by social scientists and doctors as DARVO - Deny, Accuse, Reverse Victim/Offender.\n\nIn this video, I further examine the treatment and writings of Steve Isitt, and public misrepresentation of Steve by Ron, sharing verses that come to mind as I encourage ALL believers to follow God\u0027s Word faithfully, even to judge as the church when there is a disagreement among fellow believers, for the sake of sin being exposed and all of us having fellowship in the light.\n\nThis video and all my videos are to expose hidden works of darkness, to help restore fellowship among all believers (as much as I can) and to stop the abuse of fellow slaves of the Lord. I have no intention to malign anyone or anything. I sincerely write in a spirit of love for every person affected by these conflicts among God\u0027s children.\n\nI refer to/read from www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/what-is-darvo#darvo-and-mental-health, a message given by Ron Kangas in the Philippines in 2020, an official complaint filed by Stephen Isitt with the court after all his attempts to fellowship with leading ones in the church community he had considered to be his spiritual home and family, and verses from God\u0027s Word.\n\n\n#livingstreamministry #thelordsrecovery #thelocalchurch #ronkangas",

      "description": "From multiple witnesses\u0027 reports, Watchman Nee, Witness Lee and Bill Gothard engaged in and/or covered up years of immorality. All three of them also taught not to speak about anything that is evil, nor to hear/listen to anything evil. Although this may seem justifiable by some scriptures, it leaves the vulnerable with no one to turn to, no one who will listen to them. It allows wolves to prey on the lambs. For such leaders, it\u0027s convenient and even necessary that no one will listen to the lambs if and when they finally cry out for help. \n\nSpeaking can bring in light and healing and justice. When someone\u0027s works are evil, they don\u0027t want any speaking about evil things. When someone\u0027s works are evil, they try to protect themselves with immunity as \u0022authority\u0022 figures. When someone\u0027s work is evil, they say that those who know evil are in death and that God hates death more than sin. All of these teachings silence and ignore the lambs who are being abused by authors of such teachings, or by those predators the teachers are protecting.\n\nI read some from these sources, (as well as correspondence from Don Hardy):\nblendedbody.com/WitnessLee/1974/Scanned%20Document1.pdf\nwww.recoveringgrace.org/2014/02/silencing-the-lambs/\nbibleread.online/all-books-by-Watchman-Nee-and-Witness-Lee/book-collected-works-of-watchman-nee-the-set-3-vol-50-messages-for-building-up-new-believers-3-Watchman-Nee-read-online/36/\n\n#witnesslee #watchmannee #lordsrecovery #thelocalchurch",

If you are to address concerns about brothers, at least properly represent their actual concerns instead of blaming them for making \u0022unfounded and malicious attacks.\u0022 These brothers expressed godly and scriptural concerns, taking a scriptural way, and are falsely accused, in this letter alone, but even further in \u0022The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion.\u0022\n\nI am speaking out because God tells us to expose works of darkness. \n\n#lordsrecovery #localchurches #witnesslee #livingstreamministry",

I highlight the author\u0027s thoroughly researched accounts on who Watchman Nee was, some about his ministry as the undisputed leader in \u0022The Little Flock\u0022, as well as some of the sex scandals in which Watchman Nee was involved, that are denied/covered up by many followers to this day, because though Nee admitted to them in writing, and though they are corroborated by victim statements, he never confessed them to the church, and those who knew never publicly reproved him, that all may take warning, as the Bible guides us to do. Following God\u0027s Word, though difficult in such situations in which leaders are involved in sexual sins including raping women, reduces the amount and level of stumbling, and can lead to repentance of perpetrators, healing of victims, and learning of all. \n\nProfessor Xi credits Nee\u0027s stenographer and secretary of over 20 years (1932-1952) and others who knew Nee well, for much firsthand, eye-witness information published in this book.\n\nMore to come in my next video, Watchman Nee \u0026 Witness Lee in book \u0022Redeemed by Fire\u0022 (2010) - Part 2.\n\n#watchmannee #witnesslee #lordsrecovery #thelocalchurch #livingstreamministry",

      "description": "Many in leadership positions, with more \u0022power\u0022 than other members, act like they are taking the high road to not say anything: to not \u0022revile,\u0022 not to \u0022justify themselves\u0022... They may reference 1 Peter 2, which says, \u0022Reviled, He did not revile in return...\u0022 But the context is: \u0022If you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God. To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps. \u0027He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.\u0027 When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly...\u0022  The main point is that we are to suffer for doing GOOD, and we can refrain from returning insults, committing everything to God who judges righteously.  This is not justification for sinning and then being silent to those confronting us for sinning. And NO ONE should be unaccountable to others for their sins - especially  people in positions of church leadership.\n\nSee www.youtube.com/watch?v=848phJ-5wow for a clip of Witness Lee sharing how he said nothing while being accused of being a thief. He was actually accused of being involved in very offensive things, and never acknowledged that, while leading his audience to believe that he had done nothing sinful, and that he was taking the high road amidst false accusations. \n\nI never feel I do justice on these topics. Hopefully the fellowship in the comments can do better than I can do in videos.\n\n#thelocalchurch #livingstreamministry #localchurches #witnesslee",

No. \n\nThere is Jesus, who fulfilled all the types and prophecies in the Old Testament. Through His death and resurrection He accomplished redemption, and having ascended, He produced His one Body. He gave gifts to His Body... but NO gift was ever to be in the place of Moses or any other Old Testament figure. \n\nYet \u0022the Ministry\u0022 in \u0022the Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 makes Brother Nee, Brother Lee, and Brother We (\u0022THE blended brothers\u0022 - also very unscriptural - God has blended HIS BODY together - not certain brothers) analogous to Moses, and any who speak against their leadership as being like Miriam, Korah, Dathan, and Abihu. This is so evil and heretical, putting certain members of the Body over other members and in the place of the Head.\n\n#thelocalchurch #livingstreamministry #thelordsrecovery #lordsrecovery #localchurches #watchmannee #witnesslee #blendedbrothers #blendedcoworkers",

I lost a cousin to suicide.

I am privy to so many who have contemplated dying prematurely and purposefully, rather than living, due to pressures and abuses in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery.\u0022 \n\nI am not blaming any person nor organization/institution for any tragic death, nor for any suicidal crises which anyone has survived. I don\u0027t believe anyone should blame, nor be blamed. But we should all be reflective. \n\nAnd... I want to be very clear that for many genuine, empathetic image-bearers of their Creator and Savior, \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 has proven to be an extremely toxic and hostile environment. I speak from my firsthand experience.\n\n#thelocalchurch #thelordsrecovery #suicidalcrises",

      "description": "If certain people were not idolized in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022, and if instead, there were NO respect of persons, but only allegiance and devotion to God Himself and to His Word, to the truth, including that there should be the same care for ALL believers, I believe many of the current problems in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 would not exist. \n\nNo one would be above the law. No one would be unaccountable. There would not be double standards, nor lies about truth-tellers. Those who expose evil works of darkness would be viewed as faithful witnesses, like Antipas. Those who speak the truth in love would be patterns to others - not on a pedestal, but as healthy and normal believers, patterns of the flock. \n\nInstead, truth tellers are excommunicated and called poisonous, rebellious, leprous; they are cursed by leaders who seem to have immunity from the commandments of God. Leaders who are sinning, or whose family members are sinning, are considered untouchable, with the twisting of Scriptures, teaching congregants to \u0022cover Noah\u0022, meaning to not even see, let alone speak about, anything evil being done by leaders in \u0022the local churches\u0022 - especially \u0022God\u0027s deputy authority\u0022 - human, idolized, often self-exalted (but other-exalted is also evil) leaders. Verses like \u0022\u0022Do not touch my anointed, and do my prophets no harm\u0022 (1 Chron. 16:22) are unscripturally used to protect sinning elders. \n\nIn the New Testament, all believers are anointed. All believers are prophets. There is not a special class of those who are untouchable, nor are there those about whom leaders can lie to protect the image of their organization, family, leadership, fellow leaders, or themselves. \n\nExalting people is idolatry. That is respecting of persons. God is no respecter of persons, and God shows no partiality (Acts 10:34; Rom. 2:11). \n\n\u0022This royal law is found in the Scriptures: \u0027Love your neighbor as you love yourself.\u0027 If you obey this law, you are doing right. But if you treat one person as being more important than another, you are sinning. You are guilty of breaking God\u2019s law.\u0022 James 2:8-9\n\n#lordsrecovery #livingstreamministry #thelocalchurch #witnesslee #idolatry #favoritism",

      "description": "In the preface of the Living Stream Hymn book (1966), it says that the hymns in that hymn book are freely available for the use of all the children of God. John Ingalls authored around 200 of those hymns, and was primarily responsible for the compilation and preparation of that hymn book. \n\nYet in the 1980\u0027s and onward, after John Ingalls had gone repeatedly to Witness Lee about the immoral practices of Philip Lee (Witness Lee\u0027s son then manager of the Living Stream Ministry), he was ostracized and falsely accused. When John began to gather with believers, after being cast away by Witness Lee and his followers from \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022, he requested permission to (re)print hymns he had written. John Ingalls was denied permission to print his own hymns for the use of a congregation of believers with whom he was meeting.\n\nI can find no other explanation for such denial of usage of one\u0027s hymns except for financial motivation and abuse of power (control) by the publishing company. Why otherwise would believers - especially hymns\u0027 author - be prohibited from printing and using hymns in their worship of the Father and praise of the Son?\n\nThis, among so many other details of abuses, is very disheartening to me. Our brother John Ingalls is now with the Lord. He never publicized these abuses. But I am, because I have witnessed and experienced firsthand some of the damages of abusive behavior by Living Stream Ministry and leading ones who subscribe to this publishing company.\n\n#livingstreamministry #witnesslee #johningalls #localchurches\n#thelocalchurch #thelordsrecovery",

But as I read her letter, I realize how much Jo put into the 28 pages that she labored on and posted as an open letter; she and her late husband had much clarity about unconscionable matters that are commonplace in the community in which she and I both were raised.\n\nIn this video, I only read the first 7 of 28 pages that comprise Jo\u0027s open letter.

      "description": "Please note: This video could be so much longer, with MANY examples of/connections to what is read and alluded to. Please feel free to add comments to help complete this feeble attempt at addressing a big topic.\n\nSome people accuse me of both quoting from Watchman Nee books and Witness Lee books, while also speaking about evil and corruption in their lives, based on multiple firsthand witnesses, and in the movement with which they are associated/founders (\u0022the local churches\u0022/\u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022). For this video, I will likely receive such criticism. \n\nI will repeat as many times as necessary, if it helps: I am against abuse, corruption, hypocrisy, stumbling, covered up sin, and violating God\u0027s Word. I am FOR the Lord and everything that is His/of Him.\n\nIn this video, I share some points and excerpts from the book \u0022Spiritual Authority\u0022, also called \u0022Authority and Submission\u0022, by Watchman Nee. \n\nToo many words in this book that are according to the Bible are contradicted in patterns and practices of \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022. \u0022Authority figures\u0022  - even someone more uniquely called \u0022God\u0027s Deputy Authority\u0022 (\u0022The Minister/Apostle of the Age\u0022, The Wise Master Builder\u0022, \u0022God\u0027s Oracle\u0022...) have excommunicated God-fearing members who obey God rather than men, labeling them as \u0022rebellious\u0022 when these members recognize a discrepancy between practices/teachings of \u0022delegated authority\u0022 and God\u0027s Word, and when these members scripturally address and expose works of darkness. \n\nThere are also words in this book that directly contradict God\u0027s Word.\n\nI share a few main points with excerpts from the book:\n1. Authority is for enforcing God\u0027s/human law - maintaining/rewarding good and punishing evil.\n2. God alone receives our unqualified obedience\n3. When there is unrighteousness and misrepresenting of God, men should obey God rather than men.\n4. All members in the body are taught in God\u0027s Word to be subject/submissive to one another.\n5. If someone thinks/feels to be an authority, that one is not worthy to be that authority (p. 165).\n6. Two points that contradict the above, and contradict God\u0027s Word:\na) We shouldn\u0027t care about right or wrong/good or evil, but rather just obey delegated authority; and \nb) God and delegated authority are inseparable.\n\nIt should be noted that the examples of authority used in this book are nearly entirely from the Old Testament - all which prophesied concerning Jesus, the fulfillment of all types, figures, and every positive thing. In the New Testament, all believers are anointed as the universal priesthood and baptized into one Body to be members of Christ\u0027s Body, under our one Head. We are taught to submit to one another, not be as the Gentiles who exercise authority over one another, but rather to be servants.... There are so many other New Testament verses that endorse discerning and abhorring and exposing what is evil, and doing good, clinging to what is good, not lording it over anyone...\n\nFor more clarity on this topic, I highly recommend: Lance Ford\u0027s sharing at www.youtube.com/watch?v=w08a1eGIaTc (also at julieroys.com/podcast/honor-culture-matthew-18-how-to-control-the-masses/.\n\n#thelocalchurch \n#livingstreamministry \n#thelordsrecovery",

I and other advocates reaching out to them became stonewalled. Not one \u0022responsible brother\u0022 - let alone any responsible one from the 1987 time period, ever asked me about what happened, in spite of a whistleblower\u0027s report, and no one has apologized for what I went through. Other victims moved away and/or disappeared. \n\nThank God for those brothers, who endured being labeled rebellious and being lied about, even in Living Stream Ministry publications. \n\nI\u0027ve been thinking of the collateral damages incurred through sexual abuse, particularly in a church community or other religious community that is your support system, your social circle, and your family/home in a sense. The actual families of victims are severely impacted, multigenerationally.\n\nI have been wondering if Philip Lee had any thought of all the lives he was damaging when he assaulted me and other sisters. I wonder if his dad who defended him realized the longterm effects of sexual assault on an individual, family, and community.\n\nI decided to write - and share - a song, to the tune of \u0022Mary, Did You Know?\u0022 but called \u0022Philip, Did You Know?\u0022 The recording is rough; I can\u0027t belt it out fully, with others in the home.

The code of silence and the punishment of a victim. and a victim\u0027s family who supports the victim, coming forward to expose perpetrators can be at the indescribable loss of one\u0027s community, one\u0027s reputation, one\u0027s identity... in addition to suffering of the actual sexual abuse.\n\nSpecial thanks to the Waks family, especially Manny and his parents, for their courage and solidarity in speaking up and standing for justiice.\n\nThe documentary can currently be watched on Amazon and on Youtube (www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNMEmt8ymCE).\n\n\n#tsedek\n#mesirah\n#breakthesilence",

It seems that in both circles, there are some in power that will not tolerate believers who speak the truth about covered-up sins, though they may, to their faces, be nice, and though they teach about love. Meanwhile, I am shunned by most fellow believers in that group (\u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022), including my own husband and his family, who have various leadership roles. They have treated me one way to my face, and a very different way when I am not there (based on many reports)... and I have not been included in any of their lives for years now... well, except for our relatives on my husband\u0027s biological dad\u0027s side. My husband\u0027s biological dad, Don Lang, is SO genuine, practical and unconditionally loving to us ALL (our nuclear family - my husband, me, our son and our daughter) with ONLY a heart for oneness and peace, if possible, but also our safety and well-being), and he and his family are dear believers considered \u0022not in THE church\u0022 - an AWFUL concept in itself that prevails in \u0022the Local Churches\u0022/\u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022...

We have done so, relying not on worldly wisdom but on God\u2019s grace.\u0022\n\nBut the user I hid would say, and has said many times, just the opposite of this verse. I take this seriously. I have been called dishonest, duplicitous, and many other things by this brother, and I don\u0027t have to keep reading false accusations.\n\nWhen one is hidden from my channel, s/he cannot comment, but may still read/view what is posted. \n\nI welcome input related to this decision.

(and that death is worse than sin...) and this is contrary to the Word of God.\n\nSuch a teaching is used to silence those who report wrongdoing and who scripturally address sin; one is frequently told that they are on the \u0022wrong tree\u0022 when they discern that something is evil; \u0022knowledge, good, and evil ALL end in death, and death is more serious than sin\u0022 so the person confronting sin is by implication more offensive to God than the sinning one, because s/he is, by virtue of discerning and addressing unrighteousness, in DEATH, of death, spreading death.......\n\nThis teaching is a HERESY, and along with the teaching of \u0022God\u0027s deputy authority\u0022 in the church and \u0022the covering of Noah\u0022, serves to protect predators and silence victims in this community.\n\n#livingstreamministry #thelordsrecovery #thelocalchurch",

I hadn\u0027t interacted with her for a couple of years, mainly because of what I find to be distressing misapplication of God\u0027s precious Word. But after the Restore 2025 conference I felt to reply to a text from her, and the ensuing text exchange exemplifies this group\u0027s treatment of abuse. She didn\u0027t\u0027 mention the 2 trees, and how good and evil are on the same tree, but she says that Satan mainly comes through our self, mind, and soul-life to attack and damage the church, after I mentioned sexual molestation. And the fact that I am mentioning this seems to be assumed as my living in offenses and not letting others crucify me. \n\nNo. I won\u0027t let any of God\u0027s sheep be damaged under my watch, if I can do anything about it. And these videos and my blog are part of my speaking and holding the truth in love so that abuse will stop and God\u0027s people would be safe in God\u0027s house.\n\n#livingstreamministry #thelordsrecovery #thelocalchurch #thelocalchurches\n#witnesslee",

      "description": "Thanks to all who are praying for the Restore 2025 Conference. The Spirit is definitely speaking to the churches, for the preparation of Christ\u0027s Bride, for whom He gave Himself, in order to present the church to Himself glorious... \n\nI cannot describe the level of comfort, nourishment, refreshment and blessing I am experiencing here with so many believers from 41 states and 9 countries. \n\nThe time opened this morning with some worship; the guitarist read Jesus prayer in John 17... including, \u0022...that they all may be one...\u0022 His prayer is being answered as we are all healed and as sin and abuse - ALL works of darkness - are shined away.\n\nI was able to meet and speak with Julie Roys, and am hoping soon to have her and her staff investigate \u0022the Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022, especially related to all of the sexual, emotional and spiritual abuse I and so many others have experienced from leaders who should be protecting the sheep, but who instead prey on - or ignore/condemn the cries of - the sheep.\n\nI told Julie Roys today that I am partly here to represent older members of an abusive church community. who have faithfully spoken the truth for decades... and who have, as a result, been shamed and shunned and ex-communicated by their (fellow) leaders. \n\nHere are a few quotes from my notes, from the session with Dr. Diane Langberg today: \u0022Any pretense that sin is somehow tolerable is choosing to infect and poison the Body of my Lord.... Knowledge of the truth is the only antidote for deceit... \u0027What you have done to the least of these, you have done to ME.\u0027 If we stay silent about abuse in the church, we invite wolves. We are protecting a system, not His name. Our hearts are not made for systems but for God Himself.\u0022\n\nAnd a (rough - from my notes) quote from Mary DeMuth today: \u0022When God is in a thing, it has the FRUIT of the Spirit. There is \u0027love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control\u0027 - THAT is the measure of a ministry.\u0022\n\n#Restore2025\n#churchtoo #spiritualabuse #thelordsrecovery #thelocalchurch #livingstreamministry",

      "description": "On my way to the stables today, a recent favorite song came on the radio, \u0022Something Better\u0022 (by Blanca, with Tauren Wells). As I considered that song, and the sermon I heard this morning, in which was mentioned that God gets all the glory, I considered the matter of glory and shame. If God gets ALL the glory, and Satan gets ALL the shame, then there really is no reason for any problems among believers. \n\nIf ALL glory goes to God, then we don\u0027t have an \u0022image\u0022 we are trying to protect. We care for the truth, for righteousness, for loving treatment of others because GOD cares about those things, and we are in His image... but we don\u0027t seek to GAIN glory from ANY person, nor do we GIVE glory to ANY person.\n\nI believe ALL problems among believers are due to our giving anyone other than God the glory, and due to people thinking that any admission of guilt or fault is somehow shameful (and if people are seeking glory, they can\u0027t bear to be associated with shame...). \n\nConfessing (admitting) our sins - telling the truth, God then gets the glory; He solved our problems of sins! Jesus died that our sins could ALL be forgiven! And Satan gets all the shame - because he is the loser who comes to break in, kill, destroy, divide, damage, abuse, harrass, lie about.... precious image bearers of God.\n\nNarcissism, I believe, is people, hiding a lot of deep inner shame, trying to get glory. And divisions and many problems among believers occur when people give man glory - not God alone - which is idolatry. \n\nLet\u0027s give God ALL the glory, let\u0027s cast all blame and shame on the evil one, Satan. The enemy of God has no place in the light, where there is love and truth and life.... So, let\u0027s be honest, truthful, repenting of any sin to one another and to God... Oh, may the love and life of our Savior God flow among us and heal.\n\nSo I share a few of these thoughts in this video, and a couple songs to the beating of Ranger\u0027s hooves. :) \n\nAbba, YOURS is the glory!

Too many people believe, still, that if they don\u0027t hit/kick - or even yell at-  someone, they are not abusive. \n\nAbuse can take so many forms - and non-physical abuse is no less injurious to one\u0027s body and mind and heart as physical abuse - sometimes it is even more damaging because the victim can\u0027t show the physical proof of visible injury.\n\nAbuse thrives in secrecy. I am speaking out because silence is complicity and all of us deserve to be safe, deserve to be protected, and deserve the truth.\n\nAbusers, if you are still alive, it is not too late to repent. Abuse victims, targets, and survivors, you are not alone. Witnesses, if you see something, say something.\n\n#thelocalchurch #thelordsrecovery #nonphysicalabuse #churchtoo",

I try to address these questions in this video that is lovingly dedicated to \u0022church kids\u0022 as I previously considered/called myself... \n\nIn summary, the Bible tells us to abhor what is evil. There are 5 things (among others) I address in this video which, I assert, are evil in teachings of TLR (\u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022):\n1. Shunning of believers who express legitimate, scripture-based concerns\n2. Teaching that right and wrong, good and evil, all are on the same tree and result in death\n3. Teaching that the ground of oneness IS meeting as \u0022THE church in [city name], that meeting in that way is the only way to not be in division, is superior/exclusively scriptural, etc.\n4. Covering up sins, particularly of leaders\n5. Shaming people with thought-terminating cliches, like \u0022take the cross\u0022 (though spoken by Jesus, I believe these words are commonly misapplied, used to hurt and shame believers in this group), and \u0022get out of your mind\u0022....\n\n\n#lordsrecovery #thelocalchurch #livingstreamministry",

      "description": "The letter I read in this video, shared with me by \u0022Priestly Scribe\u0022 (on Youtube and other social media platforms), was written about 4 1/2 years ago, by Don Hardy, to fellow former members of \u0022the local church.\u0022 At the time of his writing of this letter, Don Hardy was about 90 years old. He went to be with the Lord this past autumn, and was a total lover and enjoyer of Jesus to the end of his earthly days, from my reading of his many pages of testimony and even hearing his joyful voice on recordings... in addition to this letter. \n\nDon Hardy was one of the only ones (or maybe THE only one) who directly witnessed BOTH Timothy Lee and Philip Lee, at separate times, in sexually immoral acts, and who much later, reported these in writing. Don Hardy worked directly with Witness Lee since the early 1960s, and watched firsthand multiple business ventures in which Witness Lee, with his sons Timothy and Philip Lee, engaged, including Daystar - a luxury RV company (see thumbnail photo and website link below); the Lee family finally became very wealthy, multimillionaires, through the non-profit Witness Lee ran with his son Philip: Living Stream Ministry. \n\nDon Hardy was warned as a young believer in his 20s about the perilous snares faced by Christian workers: pride, mishandling of money, and sexual temptations. His letter I share in this video is written to encourage all \u0022former\u0022 members of \u0022the local church\u0022 to continue to contend for the faith once for all delivered and entrusted to God\u0027s holy people (Jude 3), while also being warned about these snares.\n\nI am so thankful for so many dear believers who did not remain silent about their experiences and observations, but who have shared - and continue to share - their testimonies, for our admonition, warning, strengthening and encouragement.\n\nPicture: A remaining Daystar RV - one of 16 made with many dear Christians\u0027 (in \u0022the Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 in the early 1970s) donations: www.autoevolution.com/news/1974-dodge-daystar-motorhome-is-a-rare-but-sad-sight-219071.html#agal_0\n\n#lordsrecovery #thelocalchurch #witnesslee #livingstreamministry",

      "description": "After hearing tonight from a brother that there have been recent references to \u0022a sister on the internet\u0022 speaking evil things, or something like that... I felt compelled to speak up - even louder. I look forward to addressing ANYTHING spoken ABOUT me, by men who refuse to speak WITH me about sexual assault at the hands of Philip Lee in 1987, who was in a position of power as manager of the Living Stream Ministry, while I was a 16-year-old, far from my home, in Taipei, and almost alone with this now-KNOWN predator (and at that time a known predator by a select few...) - with only one witness there, who reported this, and shortly after, disappeared from my church community... whom I now know was herself a victim of Philip\u0027s sexual assault, too.\n\nDear brothers have repeatedly tried to deal appropriately and scripturally with this matter (and other matters), and in doing so, were smeared and lied about and ostracized from this \u0022church community\u0022 - that MUST be recognized as a cult by the way leaders are handling such offenses, instead making whistleblowers out to be the offenders - not the sexual predators and liars.\n\nIf \u0022senior\u0022 coworkers in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 refuse to speak with a victim of sexual assault and refuse make things right according to God\u0027s Word, repenting for covering up sin after sin after sin of fellow leading ones in this group, but instead try to smear me, as they have done to so many before me, I will keep addressing EVERY reference they make - of which I am aware, and I look forward to raising more public awareness, through the Roys Report or any other reliable and godly coverage, in the future. \n\nThe darkness cannot overcome the light. And light comes in with the truth. \n\nCovering up abuse is lying by omission. Being aware of abuse (especially systemic, repeated, prolific abuse) and not confronting it is enabling. I will do neither.\n\n[Clarification: When I say in this video that I am stronger than John Ingalls or Steve Isitt, I do not mean that I am stronger than them, but that what I have spoken is likely to be perceived as more inflammatory than what they ever spoke, and yet they have been accused of terrible things\u2026 for having spoken the truth out of a loving concern and a desire for fellowship. My point is that having spoken more \u201Coffensively\u201D than these brothers, I fully expect to be smeared as they have been\u2026. But God knows that I too want what these brothers and many others seek - that sin would be dealt with and love would prevail and oneness actualized/restored. i truly don\u0027t want anyone to be hurt or shamed\u2026 except our one enemy, Satan.]\n\n#thelocalchurch \n#livingstreamministry \n#thelordsrecovery \n#witnesslee \n#philiplee\n#sexualabuse\n#metoomovement \n#churchtoo",

      "description": "A brief blast to the past, though not as brief as I planned. I was inspired by Robert Taylor\u0027s reflections to also reflect a bit, and went to where I store some things to find some artifacts. \n\nI found more from my Young People Trainings, and felt to share them. I actually planned to just share a note I found, that related to Robert Taylor\u0027s recent video on High Demand and High Control (youtu.be/6d9b17eD0UA?si=oIMV0gbSwD_OyfIx) in this group... but then I felt to share more.\n\nThese segments that compose this video provide a bit of context to the \u002784-\u002789 time, in which some elders repeatedly expressed some concerns, and during that period of time were labeled \u0022rebellious\u0022 and \u0022old\u0022 and \u0022dissenting\u0022 - not one with their \u0022husband\u0022 Witness Lee (see previous video posted earlier today, \u0022Deeply Offensive Excerpts from Elders Training\u0022 - youtu.be/SuBZrGEguWI?si=drc07AasNk6wJSQ1). After expressing their concerns as shepherds of the flock, some brothers resigned in these years, including John Ingalls and Al Knoch in 1989 (I believe). The brothers who expressed legitimate concerns about various practices and teachings, some of which this video portray, were BY NO MEANS rebellious, and could NEVER have been accused of being rebellious, except in a High Control group in which they are treated as part of a corporate wife, in an ABUSIVE marriage, to Witness Lee. Again, see the reference of Witness Lee drawing this analogy at bibleread.online/all-books-by-Watchman-Nee-and-Witness-Lee/book-elders-training-book-07-one-accord-for-the-lords-move-Witness-Lee-read-online/4/\n\n#livingstreamministry #lordsrecovery #localchurches #thelocalchurch",

      "description": "After I watched @RobertTaylor\u0027s video tonight (\u0022The exclusion of all publications other than one in the Local Church of Witness Lee\u0022): youtu.be/HBI3YBsCum4?si=UYIgsgl9wB-PSlAw, I felt I also need to respond to \u202A@bandsoflove\u202C, who has accused me of not being concerned about the fallout related to exposing abuse. Are leaders concerned about the \u0022fallout\u0022 if works of darkness are exposed, after they have been hidden and enabled by leaders?\n\nI have no heart for innocent parties to be hurt... but abusers hurt them (us) - NOT the whistleblowers. And they can remain anonymous as long as they choose to, even if legal authorities get involved.\n\nIn this video, I mainly address these particular words of \u202A@bandsoflove\u202C   in recent comments:\n\n\u0022Ruth, you read the letter. You can talk about what I am referring to or keep bringing up the dump truck load of stuff that is in your heart (for which I can truly sympathize). By your responses, I can see why people give up talking with you.  You conclude they don\u0027t want to listen or help. When you type something that is longer than a couple sentences in length, think again what you are doing\u0022 \n\nand:\n\n\u0022Perhaps I\u0027m assuming too much, but your going public with all these videos says to me you exhausted the in-person meetings and wanted a larger audience. One thing that does bother me, is that you don\u0027t seem to care about the fallout. How to deal with abuse of all kinds is complicated. Generally it is not just the actions of the perpetrators. Invariably there are innocent spouses, children, grandchildren, in-laws, etc. You seem to want a public accounting of everything that has happened anywhere in any church. Not everyone does including the actual victims. Especially now that in many cases decades have already passed. If anyone wants to make it a legal or civil matter there are courts that hear those cases. Most of the cases and people you bring up have been dealt with as appropriate by the church leadership. Perhaps not to your timetable or satisfaction, but you weren\u0027t the one on the scene, responsible for it. Thus you don\u0027t know all.  If you want to put your own family out on the internet that is your decision, but I expect even in your own family some are not comfortable with it.\u0022\n\n\nOh... I just saw this one, and didn\u0027t speak to it [yet]:\n\u0022Short is better.   If your comments were directed to my questions, I can read and process that. You are in same boat with Al since you feel you are clear about the state of the Recovery and all people in it and they are poor and degraded and deserving of condemnation. That is not sober minded. Using your own argument, your problem is with individuals not the movement. Stop condemning it wholesale. Some bad apples don\u0027t mean the whole is bad. What church, denomination, school, business, country hasn\u0027t had bad actors. Many of them never brought to account for their actions. Now many of the people who caused the problems aren\u0027t even alive. What do you really want to be done?\u0022\n\nPosting this response to @bandsoflove, also in my comments to your above message... whew! It\u0027s NOT over 3 sentences...\n\n@bandsoflove: If Albert Zehr is not soberminded, I don\u0027t know who is. I am honored to be in his company.\n\nIf the \u0022individuals\u0022 include Watchman Nee - who by the report of multiple victims raped sisters and never repented to the church - and Witness Lee - who repeatedly heard reports of his sons raping and molesting sisters and at the same time gave Philip more and more power and \u0022authority\u0022 in the Living Stream AND in the churches, and who defrauded believers of their life savings and then became extremely materially wealthy - a multi-millionaire - through the Living Stream Ministry... and all those who shame \u0022other\u0022 Christians who don\u0027t follow Watchman Nee and Witness Lee, as being degraded, and lie about and smear brothers who speak the truth, and those who either ARE abusive or who cover up/stay silent about abuse of which they are aware, then, yes, I guess my problem is with individuals.",

      "description": "In this video I read a bit more from Dr. Lily Hsu\u0027s book about her memories from Shanghai Christian Assembly, especially her description of effects (on her and on others) of learning of Watchman Nee\u0027s covered up sins. These sins were largely covered up due to his teachings on \u0022authority and submission\u0022 that guarded him, as a self-proclaimed deputy authority, from being scripturally accountable to other members of the Body of Christ, without impunity. \n\nWatchman Nee taught his followers to submit to him, and that submission means cutting off your head... so no believer was allowed to address genuine concerns or confront him about his sins, his interpretation of scriptures, etc. (Nee, CWWN Vol. 57, ch. 24, sec. 3). And this attitude and such teachings still remain in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 with damaging but accepted practices.\n\nThe covering up of sins can be more stumbling than the sins themselves. To this day, so many sins are still covered up by leaders in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 - continuing the same pattern that stumbled many early believers who followed Watchman Nee in China. We should learn from history, repent, and not keep repeating the same errors.\n\nWe are not stumbled by the fact that King David sinned - because he repented. We are comforted to know that all of us, even King David, a man after God\u0027s heart, are sinners, and that all, even an adulterer and a murderer, can repent and be forgiven. \n\nBut not confessing and forsaking sins is a different matter. And condemning people who speak the truth, shunning and ostracizing them and calling them leprous, etc. only makes the issues more serious, because then the healing fellowship in the light is cut off, and the life-supply hindered among the members.\n\nEventually, ALL will be known.\n\nMark 4:22 For nothing is hidden except to be made manifest; nor is anything secret except to come to light.\n\nLuke 8:17 For nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest, nor is anything secret that will not be known and come to light.\n\n1 Timothy 5:25 So also good works are conspicuous, and even those that are not cannot remain hidden.\n\nMatthew 10:26\u201333\nHave no fear... for nothing is covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known.\n\nReference: Hsu, L. M. and Dana Roberts (2013). My Unforgettable Memories: Watchman Nee and Shanghai Local Church. \n\n#watchmannee #livingstreamministry #localchurches #thelocalchurch \n\nFor those who dispute the validity/veracity of the book from which I mainly read in this video, please read: blendedbody.com/LilyHsu/DanaRoberts2013.png. Here is part:  \u0022Dr. Hsu\u0027s book is the story of Nee by those \u0027left behind.\u0027 In my research I discovered works in Chinese, even a diary by Wang Ming Dao, expressing deep disappointments with Nee\u0027s real life. Because of my prior research Dr. Hsu asked me to work on an English, privately published edition of her Memoirs (Why self-published? In the past, Nee\u0027s Local Church movement in America has used the power of law suits against publishers to suppress any disagreement.) Because of the serious allegations she made I went to Shanghai in 2006 and talked to people who knew Nee. They confirm what Dr. Hsu wrote. Thus far the reviews of the book have been written by people who know very little about the Shanghai church after 1949 (One reviewer hadn\u0027t even read the book). Nee is not the hero, but she tells us about others who served God in China. Some even died for their faith. Without her book they are known by a few friends and by God.\u0022",

      "description": "Following the pattern of our brother Martin Luther, I have some statements to make \u0022out of love for the truth and from desire to elucidate it.\u0022 These are just some of the points (probably only half of them) regarding God\u0027s Word and how it is NOT being honored in many ways by the teachings and practices and attitudes in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 - specifically among \u0022responsible one\u0022 /\u0022senior coworkers\u0022 who, even if they should disagree with a practice or teaching based on their rich knowledge of God\u0027s Word and based on their conscience, are required to tow the line lest they by labeled as dissenting, poisonous, negative, rebellious, etc. Such forced uniformity prohibits open and honest fellowship toward healing of various wounds and proper addressing of legitimate concerns.\n\nIn spite of such threats of labels and loss of life-long community, some of us must speak out if there is ever to be healing. \n\nSilence is complicity with abuse. And there is too much abuse in this group. It is just well-concealed by too many....\n \nI include some points here that are more personal, based on my specific experience, but I also try to capture at least some of the issues I have observed and experienced, and the verses/principles being violated in God\u0027s Word. I am ready to, as Martin Luther said, \u0022defend the following statements and to dispute on them\u0022 along with other victims, witnesses and experts of the statements and matters of the truth addressed herein. I do not write these things without fellowshipping over months with fellow members who share many of these convictions, and who are willing and desirous to defend the truth and to see abusive behaviors and violations of the conscience cease.\n\nPlease note: This is not a smear campaign, as I am being accused of conducting. This is not a spiteful reaction to being mistreated and abandoned by my husband. Such a crisis of experience only caused me to confront current abuse, the impotence of church leaders to help us - and the common exacerbating of the problems that their involvement precipitated, and eventually I realized that there is a pattern of covering up abuse - including the sexual assault I experienced at 16 years old, when in Taipei, at the hands of Philip Lee, of which I know leading ones were aware, yet did nothing about. To process my experiences, I searched for others\u0027 experiences in this and other high-control groups. Healing comes partly by finding fellowship and understanding with others who can relate. \n\nI am so grateful for all who have spoken out publicly, published words of truth and their personal testimonies on various platforms, and to those who have shared their experiences more privately. Knowing we are not alone helps to lessen the cognitive dissonance that can otherwise feel unbearable.\n\nThis is a defense of the truth and a speaking against abuse of believers, that the abuse would stop, that works of darkness would be exposed, and the Lord\u0027s Bride could be made ready, clothed in the righteousnesses of the saints, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing. For this I am willing to contend for the faith, along with so many who went before me - many who passed away having been shunned, smeared, lied about, and banned from gatherings in this group due to their speaking out; many who are still exposing works of darkness in love for the truth and for the church; and many who will follow.\n\n\u201CBut let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream\u0022 (Amos 5:24).\n\n#livingstreamministry #lordsrecovery #thelocalchurch #witnesslee #watchmannee #thelordsrecovery #localchurches",

I am singing all but that last one while taking a brisk walk.\n\nToday marks my 29th Anniversary. I have been apart. from my husband for all but one of the past seven anniversaries.

A few days later... we were separated again, despite my disregarded pleas that our marriage would be honored. Our nuclear family has not recovered from that nightmarish recurrence of forced separation - a day Nathan called the hardest day in his life.\n\nThank you to anyone who attended our wedding or visited our home or cared for us as one unit, and who have cared for our children.

Unlike the printing of \u0022The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion\u0022 and \u0022A Response to Recent Accusations\u0022 both put out be Living Stream Ministry to publicly smear godly brothers, to untruthfully warn believers about them, no books were put out about the damages of this brother\u0027s sexual predation, nor of his financially corrupt practices - his hidden practices as a leader in this group being only one of many examples of such behavior among leaders in \u0022the local churches\u0022/\u0022the Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 and/or the Living Stream Ministry. \n\nI am posting this, being myself a victim of sexual and financial abuse in this group, and I am seeking righteousness for fellow victims. I need to know how the victims of this predator were cared for after these crimes were discovered. And I would like to know if Robbie Robinson went to jail. Were legal authorities contacted? I am putting out what I know, but I believe the consciences of believers, including mine, deserve answers, since these crimes happened against my brothers in Christ, and churches are not isolated units but are part of the universal Body. \n\nI apologize that I do accidentally directly address a couple of \u0022responsible ones\u0027 in this church community, whom I previously said I wouldn\u0027t speak to again unless they initiate contact with me toward reconciliation. When I am addressing crimes, I may inadvertently address some in \u0022responsible\u0022 positions in \u0022the\u0022 church who should scripturally confront and address sin and involve legal authorities for alleged crimes.\n\n#lordsrecovery #livingstreamministry #thelocalchurch #churchinfairborn",

The Bride of Christ is loving - of her Bridegroom, and as we love Him Whom we have not seen, we must love our brothers and sisters whom we have seen - If anyone says, \u201CI love God,\u201D and hates (works against) his [Christian] brother he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen. (1 John 4:20)\n\nI also had the strong conviction that to keep the oneness of the church, which has been existing and developing for over 2000 years, we should put on love which is the uniting bond of perfection, and worship in spirit and truthfulness, and not subscribe to any legalities of calling ourselves \u0022THE church in ___[a city]___,\u0022 that this wasn\u0027t taught by Jesus nor by the apostles in the New Testament, and making this a legal matter actual causes division - a distinction constantly made, and a difference in care and love among believers in Christ, each of whom is part of His Body and Bride.

      "description": "I will keep pleading: \u0022Responsible Ones in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 - Please RESTORE Stephen Isitt to the fellowship in ALL the churches. He should not be banned from meetings. I make my case in this video.\n\nI feel a pain in the Body of Christ due to the ostracization, excommunication, and/or banning of my brother Stephen Isitt from \u0022the\u0022 churches in Bellevue, Seattle, and probably any other \u0022local church\u0022 affiliated with the Living Stream Ministry, based on public defamatory and condemning words spoken about him by \u0022senior co-workers\u0022 in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery.\u0022 This matters. It affects the WHOLE Body of Christ. Every member is necessary. Indispensable. My pain, \u0026 many others\u0027 pain, IS the feeling in the Body.\n\nIn my quest for what Stephen Isitt has specifically been accused of, and what he has been told he must do in order to be able to meet with \u0022the churches\u0022 - believers he loves and with whom he was built for decades, I found the requirements stated in 2 emails from an elder, Sherman Robertson (who is now with the Lord).\n\nSherman wrote in 2004: \u0022I will not be having anything more to do with you unless and until I see a complete and thorough point-by-point apology and retraction of every item in your \u201Cbook\u201D [In the Wake of the New Way] that has been posted on the Internet. And I want to see it on the Internet. Otherwise, I will be closed off to any other matter regarding you. Your statements of just \u201Cwanting to enjoy the Lord and go on\u201D mean nothing to me. That would have worked if you were just a brother who loves the Lord without any history of damage. YOU HAVE A HISTORY. Sherman\u0022\n\nSo I read through the book for which Steve Isitt is being required to apologize, which he is being told to retract publicly point by point. This \u0022book\u0022 and his sharing his concerns ARE the only \u0022history of damage\u0022, up to that point, in my awareness, for which he is being accused. \n\nIn reading through the book, again, I don\u0027t see anything to apologize for nor to retract. It is full of appreciation for Brother Lee\u0027s ministry but also full of concern for saints no longer meeting... a concern SHARED by Brother Lee: \u0022In the last few years, we have appreciated the Lord\u0027s showing us the high peak of the divine revelation. My concern is that although we may talk about the truths of the high peak, love is absent among us. If this is the case, we are puffed up, not built up. The Body builds up itself in love\u0022 and \u0022according to my observance throughout the years, most of the co workers have a human spirit of \u0022power\u0022 but not love. We need a spirit of love to conquer the degradation of today\u0027s church...this is what the recovery needs.\u0022 The Vital Groups, Witness Lee) \n\nAnd: \u0022Today, there are many brothers and sisters who need help. Hence, we have to do our best to contact them, to be concerned and care for them in love, and to strive to help and shepherd them. I hope the elders and co-workers would take this word of fellowship and exhortation to give their all and their time to contact and shepherd people. This was our shortage in the past. Now we must recover this matter.\u0022 (A Timely Trumpeting for the Present Need).\n\nThis burden, expressed by Witness Lee, is the heart of Stephen Isitt\u0027s writing \u0022In the Wake of the New Way\u0022!!\n\nSherman writes, \u0022Brother Lee was never wrong about anything that happened regarding the rebellion with John I. in the late 1980\u0027s.\u0022 But there was NO rebellion of John Ingalls in the 1980s. How/Against WHOM did John Ingalls \u0022rebel\u0022?  John Ingalls was a godly man addressing very serious sins including sexual assault of multiple sisters by the manager of the Living Stream Ministry, and John Ingalls was a church elder in Anaheim; some of the victims were in the church under his care as a shepherd. It would have been utterly negligent and complicit for an elder NOT to address these concerns with the Head of the Living Stream Ministry and the father of the perpetrator. But for doing so, he was labeled as rebellious and the sexual predation continued.\n\nRegarding many, including Sherman, claiming Witness Lee was \u0022never wrong\u0022... Witness Lee said himself (From FINAL word by Witness Lee):\n\u201CThe co-workers in different places need to learn; all responsible brothers in all localities need to learn. The eyes of the brothers and sisters all need to be opened. Too many things we need to learn. We have acted wrongly in the past, including me, I have to admit. I have had very painful repentance before the Lord. I am very sorry! I am sorry for the Body of Christ - not only for the brothers and sisters among us, but also for the ones in the denominations. You have to bring this message back and read it over and over again in mutual fellowship. Then you will see we were wrong before\u2026 To understand and analyze this needs a fair bit of effort.... We must learn from our past mistakes to receive people according to God\u0027s Son...undeviating\u2026 not deviating a bit from the path\u2026\u201D (His final message Chinese New Year Conference, Anaheim, Feb 1997)",

Those raised in this family, my children, are being adversely affected - beyond words.\n\nFor decades brothers and sisters, fellow members of the Body of Christ, have been seeking righteousness in our church community. Those raised in this community are being adversely affected - beyond words.\n\nUntil there is closure (repair and healing, or righteous dealing with clear judgement), the young ones will keep being hurt, stumbled, immeasurably.\n\nI am making yet another plea, trying to draw as simple an analogy as possible between my family situation and church situation, both rife with unrighteousness and chaos that needs to be properly addressed. God\u0027s principle is that such matters should be resolved quickly. Please don\u0027t keep delaying. \n\nMatt. 5:25, Amplified Version - Come to terms quickly [at the earliest opportunity] with your opponent at law while you are with him on the way [to court], so that your opponent does not hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you are thrown into prison.\n\nMatt. 18:6 - But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in and acknowledge and cleave to Me to stumble and sin [that is, who entices him or hinders him in right conduct or thought], it would be better (more expedient and profitable or advantageous) for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be sunk in the depth of the sea.\n\n\n#livingstreamministry  #thelocalchurch #thelocalchurches #thelordsrecovery",

      "description": "Published words (by Living Stream Ministry), along with despising attitudes and multiple reports of sexual impropriety, in addition to my own personal experiences, are disgraceful related to the treatment of women (sisters) in \u0022the local churches\u0022; the sum of so many cruel words and accounts all really bothered me deeply today, and I believe all contribute toward the abuse of women (\u0022sisters\u0022) in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery.\u0022 \n\nI don\u0027t expound too much in this video - I mainly read some excerpts from \u0022the Ministry\u0022 that I find very cruel and oppressive regarding sisters, and an eyewitness account of sexual immorality in the Living Stream office in the \u002770s that was never dealt with, and which continued to victimize sisters into the late 80s, if not longer. Such treatment is clearly a pattern in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery.\u0022 Diminishing attitudes, words and treatment are pervasive in this group, and I could only confront it head-on when I was the target in my own marriage and couldn\u0027t protect my children from much impact of the abuse, with no (or with minimal, grossly inadequate) support from \u0022the local church\u0022 leaders.\n\nI understand - many sisters (I was one of them) feel honored to be sisters, to simply serve and submit. But if there is too much abuse, one begins to seek help, and when there is no help, one has to confront the issues, and when I did that, I found, and I\u0027m sure I will continue to find, reasons I have been treated so cruelly, found in the teachings and practices of those who consider themselves \u0022responsible ones\u0022 in what they teach and believe are the ONLY legitimate churches on the earth.\n\nI could say SO much more... but am trying to keep these videos brief.

The abuse I wrote about continues to this day.\n\nIn this video message, I address the responsible leaders in the Lord\u0027s Recovery ministry, emphasizing the importance of confession and recompense based on Watchman Nee\u0027s teachings, since you claim to follow HIM. \n\nI speak on behalf of many who have suffered the negligence and abuse of leaders in this group, in spite of countless pleas for help, for intervention, for change, for justice, for righteousness, for reconciliation, for oneness.... We offer proof for what you call \u0022baseless accusations,\u0022 while you blame us for lying, being people of death, being evil, though you specify no scriptural offense for which any of us can repent....\n\nI share some of my personal experiences and challenges faced over the past  recent years, mainly through reading a couple emails and texts previously sent to several of you (who are likely gathered at the Thanksgiving Conference in Atlanta this weekend). To these desperate emails I received minimal to no response from \u0022responsible ones.\u0022 Most responses from \u0022responsible ones\u0022 which I have received to these and other pleas, in my perspective, constitute further abuse. \n\nWatchman Nee writes in Messages for Building Up New Believers, published by the Living Stream Ministry (bibleread.online/all-books-by-Watchman-Nee-and-Witness-Lee/book-messages-for-building-up-new-believers-vol-2-Watchman-Nee-read-online/22/): \n\n\u0022In order to live under God\u2019s light, we need a sensitive conscience, and in order for our conscience to remain sensitive, we need to continually condemn sin as sin. We need to confess to God, and we also need to make confessions and recompenses to man....\n\n\u0022If you remember that your brother has something against you, this means you have transgressed against him. Your transgression may or may not be in material things. Perhaps you have offended him by acting unrighteously towards him. The emphasis is not on material things but on that which sets others against you. \n\n\u0022A new believer should realize that if he offends a person and does not apologize and ask for forgiveness, he is finished as soon as the offended party mentions his name and sighs before God. Whatever he offers to God will not be accepted. Whatever he prays will be turned down. We should not allow any brother or sister to sigh before God because of us. Once he or she sighs, we are finished before God. If we have done something wrong or if we have offended or hurt someone, the offended party need not accuse us before God. All he has to say before God is, \u201COh! So-and-so...\u201D or, for that matter, he just needs to utter an \u201COh\u201D and whatever we offer to God will be rejected. All he has to do is sigh a little because of us before God. We must not give any brother or sister the reason or the ground to sigh before God because of us. If we give him or her a reason to sigh, we will lose all our spiritual prospects and all our gifts to God will be annulled....\n\n \u0022If you are offering a gift at the altar and remember that your brother has anything against you or has any reason to sigh because of you, do not offer up your gift. If you want to offer to God, \u201CFirst go and be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.\u201D God wants the gift, but you must first be reconciled to others. Those who are not reconciled to men will not be able to offer a gift to God.\n\n\u0022Hopefully, the brothers and sisters will be thorough in the matter of confession and recompense. This is the way to maintain their purity. If anyone has transgressed against man, he should confess his sins to God on the one hand, and he must deal with the matter seriously with man on the other hand.\u0022\n\nViewers, especially \u0022responsible ones\u0022 in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 are encouraged to reflect on the significance of taking responsibility for your part in the damage of my marriage and family, to consider your part in the all-too-common mistreatment of others (sisters and brothers in Christ, precious enough to be redeemed by His own blood), to confess, and to offer recompense for your wrongdoings, if the Lord shines on you that you had any part in abuse and/or sins that have hurt and/or are still hurting anyone. Many of us are sighing to God about you.\n\n#lordsrecovery #localchurch #localchurches #livingstreamministry",

      "description": "To all believers in Christ who care, who want and seek the oneness of Christ\u0027s Body, and who hate abuse... specifically to my dear friends, brothers and sisters in Christ attending this week\u0027s Living Stream Ministry Thanksgiving Conference:\n\nI understand. I was just like you. I felt excited, special, blessed... any time I could participate in one of the \u0022Seven Feasts\u0022 in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 (TLR).\n\nAfter all, we had been \u0022delivered\u0022 from \u0022degraded Christianity.\u0022 We were chosen, called, and faithful. We were, without usually admitting it, an elite group, superior to other Christians. Others were so worldly. We were consecrated and most like the early churches. We were most likely to be overcomers. We were Philadelphia... I believed...\n\n...Until I realized that there wasn\u0027t actually, practically the necessary brotherly love in my desperate situation, but rather extreme partiality and heirarchy and rampant abuse and teachings that twisted the Bible to cover sin and abusers \n\n...Until I couldn\u0027t attend gatherings anymore, due to abuse that I couldn\u0027t hide and about which I was warned not to speak, but which is hurting and stumbling me and my adult children to this day... \n\n...Until I realized SO MUCH financial corruption and other sins are being covered up, and lies are being told, and my brothers and sisters are being slandered and banned from such conferences and any other \u0022church\u0022 meetings - due to their faithfully judging sins and seeking to clear up ongoing stumbling actions and inaction in TLR. \n\n...Until I couldn\u0027t subscribe to a leadership and publishing company that profits to the extent of making the \u0022minister of the age\u0022 a multimillionaire, publishing books of ministers who say they stand on the shoulders of so many believers while belittling and shaming those believers and not giving credit for, nor remaining open to, the light and life and ministry of every member of Christ\u0027s Body - even going as far as to call other ministers rebellious for not submitting to the singular Minister of the Age, the Oracle of God, the Wise Master Builder, God\u0027s Deputy Authority on the earth.....\n\n...Until I couldn\u0027t bear the use of money to abuse me, and finding a systemic disparity of wealth between the powerful leaders and other privileged and highly regarded members - while the abused whistleblowers like me are marginalized and even desperate needs are completely overlooked.\n\n...Until I realized that the haughty attitude that pervades \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery,\u0022 of somehow being better than other believers or other gatherings of believers IS sin and IS divisive.\n\nSo to all my dear friends who are attending the \u0022Thanksgiving Conference\u0022 online or in-person in Atlanta, perhaps you consider yourselves special. Maybe you consider yourselves objects of God\u0027s mercy since you consider yourselves still \u0022in the Lord\u0027s Recovery,\u0022 that you haven\u0027t \u0022left\u0022 in a \u0022rebellion.\u0022 I thought that too, for decades. Now I know what I was told were rebellions were actually events when believers\u0027 consciences forced them to confront leaders regarding untenable hypocrisy, rampant sexual misconduct, retaliatory false accusations of saints, and unbearable abuse; and that for confronting leadership regarding these sins, these faithful saints, some direct victims of crimes committed by leaders in TLR, were labeled as poisonous and rebellious, and they were quarantined - banned from any further fellowship with members in \u0022the\u0022 (\u0027genuine\u0022, \u0022on the ground of oneness\u0022) churches.\n\n#localchurch #livingstreamministry #lordsrecovery #thelocalchurch",

This is a far-from-perfect take, but my fingers are not as calloused as they used to be, and I already recorded several takes.\n\nThis song is truly for ALL who have been hurt, it is to the shepherds of God\u0027s sheep, and most of all, this song is to the Lord, our Good, Faithful, Great Shepherd Who WILL heal us, bring each of His lambs back, and carry us all through these trials, all the way to glory.\n\nThe original tune came to me in the Fall of 1992, while I was staying with a family whose father/husband went to be with the Lord during that time. The tune never left my heart since then. The words came to me, hours after my husband drove away from the office where I was working, a few weeks ago, after I shook (physically) for those hours and tried to record a video of me speaking, trying to explain to viewers the effects of abuse I and others have experienced at the hand of \u0022shepherds\u0022 in my former church community. Unable to speak, I found my outlet through this song. The words are largely from Ezekiiel 34.",

      "description": "A common thread in the treatment of (former) members of \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 (TLR) is a pattern of many vague accusations, without actually rebuking these believers for actual, specific sins. Those who are being accused have definite sins that are being covered up - a practice that is contrary to keeping the oneness. Sins must be judged for the sake of the keeping of the oneness. I share 4 examples, as well as excerpts from Watchman Nee that expound on versus in 1 John, that judging sins is the basis for oneness - since our fellowship is in the light, where sin is properly dealt with. The second excerpt is from \u0022Resist the Devil\u0022 in which Watchman Nee states that Satan\u0027s accusations are not clear, and they make us feel worthless. Believers who rebuke a sinning saint do so because that saint is precious, valued, worth rebuking because we don\u0027t want to lose one another, nor to lose the fellowship, the oneness. Treating others with the silent treatment and with vague accusations does not show a valuing of fellow believers - the desire to restore, recover, and reconcile.\n\n#localchurch \n#lordsrecovery \n#thelocalchurch \n#thelordsrecovery \n#livingstreamministry \n#spiritualabuse",

No believer should have to keep secrets or subscribe to a particular minister to be fully welcomed in fellowship; if this is the case, the \u201Cfellowship\u201D is sectarian - not the one fellowship of the one Body of Christ. \n\nBut I don\u2019t want to get doctrinal in these fireside chats.

They also have not practiced keeping God\u2018s basic laws and refuse to communicate with me to remedy this matter and to restore fellowship and harmony, which is especially critical for the younger ones who are affected by the breach of fellowship the most, perhaps. As I sought for scriptural reconciliation with family members, extending my pleas for help to leading ones in the church, I began to realize that the entire group is based on a leadership that behaves much like my in-laws. There\u2019s a rejection of what is in God\u2019s word and shaming of people who bring up offenses, violations to God\u2018s word, and seek to deal with those offenses in the scriptural way, particularly if it contradicts what the group refers to as the ministry of the age, if it pertains to righteousness, and if it makes anyone in leadership \u201Clook bad\u201C. \n\nThis was highlighted to me yesterday by a contrast, at a bar mitzvah, in which a Jewish community exhibited an intergenerational blessing of one another and passing down of the law of God, teaching the young ones to do what is right and just and good, something our God would never abolish, something that our Lord Jesus came to fulfill, a righteous living that surpasses the scribes and Pharisees\u2019 living, which believers in Christ should be still expressing today.",

Bob\u2019s words and attitude represent the whole leadership of \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery.\u201D It is an attitude of defending and uplifting Witness Lee amidst unconscionable treatment of other equally precious members.\n\nRon and Kerry, you wrote that John Ingalls\u2019 very proper and scriptural sharing with the church in Anaheim affected (potentially damaged) the whole Body? It did affect us, and I am forever grateful for his constitution, ministry and living; John Ingalls shared the truth, in love. He provided us as much of the truth as God led him to share at the time.  Did Philip Lee\u2019s assaults on sisters affect the whole Body? YES.\n\nAnd as Dr. Lily Hsu writes in her book, My Unforgettable Memories, the covered up sins are one thing, and are very serious, but the continuing idolatrous worship of Nee and Lee are still a major stumbling and factor of division for many believers.\n\nEli\u2019s not dealing with his son\u2019s warranted record in the Word of God.

Start with restoring the oneness with brothers and sisters you can see, who have something against you. Make things right with those you have abused. \n\nDon\u0027t say you love me if you have abused me or my brother or sister in Christ, and if you refuse to be reconciled.

This is abuse. Be reconciled, brother, to these saints you have hurt.\n\nI mention my in-laws. Your treatment of me has been abhorrent. I have something, many things, against you. These matters have not been cleared up in the light, in fellowship, as I have requested repeatedly. \n\nIf you are bringing your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way.

These brothers, Al Knoch and John Ingalls, were not accusing. They were stating their convictions, according to their consciences, that led them to withdraw as elders, as shepherds, of a church they loved and had ministered to faithfully for many years.\n\nThe photo that is the thumbnail for this video is David, Al\u0027s son, who went to be with the Lord in 1988. He is Taipei in this photo (standing with a translator), for a trip some of us took in the Spring of \u002787, before the YP Training that summer. David went to be with the Lord in \u002788. His dad, Al Knoch, went to be with the Lord a couple of years ago. We were cheated from his precious portion of Christ, and from so many others who were treated as anathema by Witness Lee\u0027s loyal followers, if/when they spoke according to their conscience regarding \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery.\u0022\n\n#lordsrecovery \n#localchurch \n#alknoch\n#johningalls\n#witnesslee\n#livingstreamministry",

Don and his family had to move from the house they were renting - an \u0022LSM\u0022-owned house. His family was extensively damaged. And his story is one of so many similar stories, of lies and abuse of power destroying precious marriages and families.\n\nThere is far too much financial corruption, \u0022spiritual\u0022 coercion, dishonesty, and sexual impropriety to fit into a Youtube video, and some I, like Don Hardy and all the others, have a hard time even mentioning, it is so defiling.\n\nOne verse Brother Don left with us in these 172 pages is: \nCorinthians 11:18\u201319: \u201CI hear that there are divisions among you. And I believe it in part, for there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized.\u201D\n\nWho is genuine? Who is truthful? Who is not hiding evil secrets that have countless victims?\n\nI am one with all believers in Christ, who are one with Christ. But we are never meant to be one with sin and lies and abuse. Don says: \u0022Brother, please know that I am NOT against any ministry which came out o f WL\u0027s mouth, from GOD. I receive it (...same as I would from the pope, if he too spoke God\u0027s Words, or truth); but I will NOT be a part of WL\u0027s and now PL\u0027s SINS! Even as they do, we all need to repent of many unconfessed things.\u0022  May we all be in the Light, enjoying the Life, in Love.... Correct me if I am wrong, but THIS is being in \u0022the Stream\u0022 - the one ministry - the ministry of the Spirit, and being one with THIS ministry, we keep the oneness... of the Spirit. It was never about any certain man, other than Jesus only. \n\nI refer to this precious document in this video: truestoryofdivisionmaking.com/uploads/3/4/7/1/34712424/rosemeadtrueaccount_1.pdf\n\n#livingstreamministry \n#localchurch \n#donhardy\n#witnesslee",

This brother\u2019s writing is full of love, light, life, and factfulness. I knew many of the facts contained in his emails, but am am still shocked, sickened and heartbroken having read of so much evil covered up in what I believed to be a pure group of Christ followers. Believers deserve to know that corruption pervades the history and present leadership of \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery.\u201D We know a tree by its fruit, and when I experienced fruits of the flesh from my own husband, then from his parents, and then from elders and coworkers, I arrived at the realization that I was being presented fleshly acts, from a  whole tree that is full of sexual immorality and impurity, uncleanness, lustful pleasures, lasciviousness, idolatry, hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions, envy, drunkenness, indulgence, and the like. Not reproving men - leaders in a Christian community no less - who practice and cover such things is sin. I cannot in good conscience call \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery\u201D a group with a long history of covered up sins and lawlessness. We all make mistakes, but righteous people confess, repent, and repair relationships to restore peace with God and with fellow humans. Righteous people who may stray or fail admit the truth and turn from their wicked ways. But I am learning of so many decades of lies and corruption; I\u2019m discovering that the personal tragic undoing of my marriage and the torture I and my adult children still are trying to survive are just samplings of the evil fruit of \u201Cthis church\u2019s\u201D leadership, practices in direct opposition to God\u2019s Word.

This is my short-version answer to her and to any young adult or teenager who might ask me about what I would recommend, related to the church.\n\nI would clarify or add to what I just recorded that under the point of genuineness - which should be the norm and which little children exemplify\u2026. A church should be a place where everyone can be genuine and is welcomed as they really are, not having to mask things or hide their wounds or their sicknesses. Young adults, teenagers, and anyone else should never have to pretend in order to be accepted in a church. We hear that the church is a hospital. It would not serve a patient well if they were expected to be fine, and had to act like everything is okay with them in a hospital.\n\nI welcome anyone else to share from their experiences, what you would say to a young adult seeking a healthy church life.",

I hope Katelyn Beaty\u0027s book, Celebrities for Jesus: How Personas, Platforms, and Profits Are Hurting the Church would help expose many wounds in Christ\u0027s Body and that there could be repentance and healing where needed.\n\nThis video specifically addresses a subsection called \u0022Abusing Power.\u0022",

      "description": "In this video I mainly read parts of the 1st section of this book, \u0022Celebrities for Jesus - How Personas, Platforms, \u0026 Profits Are Hurting the Church\u0022 by Katelyn Beaty (2022). The celebrity status of certain brothers/families has long troubled some close to me, and is, I believe, a main problem in the current (and historical) troubling situation in \u0022the church,\u0022 about which I have been speaking out. I mention in this video that Witness Lee and Philip Lee had such a dangerous and damaging celebrity status, but so do my father-in-law and my husband and many other highly regarded leading ones, in the same church community, to varying degrees, but to enough of a degree that what typical people would not get away with, they have, due to identification, \u0022love,\u0022 admiration, devotion... of many in public, while there is, behind closed doors, anger, abuse of power, cruel treatment of close family members, secrecy, giving in to temptation, and in some cases, addiction.\n\nI failed in this video to read aloud a paragraph (among many paragraphs) about Billy Graham, whom Beaty faithfully critiques regarding his celebrity status, but whose ministry was preserved due to a strict pact he made with his co-workers, the \u0022Modesto Manifesto,\u0022 to guard against common temptations. She writes (p. 38): \u0022Graham saw with prescient wisdom how intoxicating it would be for leaders to believe they are so important that they can evade accountability they need, even and perhaps especially when their work seems crucial for the kingdom. He saw that celebrity power\u0027s central lie is that an individual is important enough to be above the rules. He saw that celebrity so easily leads Christian leaders to use ministry to seek personal riches and thus defy the Bible\u0027s many warnings against greed and the love of money. He saw that celebrity causes many leaders to believe that they  can go it alone - that their individual ministries and platforms are more important and central than the  ordinary witness of local churches. And he saw that celebrity entices leaders to fudge the truth....\u0022\n\nSo applicable. Thank God for brothers who have cared, and who still care, for what went/goes on behind closed doors, even more than what is seen in public.",

      "description": "Thanks to S.N., a faithful brother who has grieved the abuse of many of his brothers and sisters in \u0022the Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 for many years, and through his labor, not in vain in the Lord, has access to many primary sources that shed necessary light and truth regarding prolific sins committed and covered up, along with other violations of God\u0027s Word, by leaders in \u0022the local churches\u0022 for decades. Without these primary sources, trusting believers could be (and have been) more easily lied to and manipulated. We believers should not lie, nor protect lies, nor love lies  (Rev. 22:15). We love God, we love and obey His Word, we love our brothers without partiality, we abhor what is evil, and we rejoice in the truth.\n\nIn this video, I mainly read a letter written by brother Paul Kerr to K. Robichaux and R. Kangas in February 1990, just 2 months after the publication of the book \u0022A Response to Recent Accusations\u0022 - a defaming book aimed at belittling and tearing down a faithful, godly older brother\u0027s testimony to the flock under his care of why, after decades as a leading one, as a primary laborer with Witness Lee on the church hymnal and the Recovery Version of the New Testament, he needed to resign from the eldership in Anaheim. \n\nI am so thankful for all of those who spoke out and especially whose words are in print, who express the same desperate concerns I share, with a heart for the oneness of the unique Body of Christ, which \u0022Body\u0022 is NOT equivalent to those who identify as \u0022the Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022/\u0022the local churches\u0022, not restricted to adherents of Witness Lee - but comprised of all genuine believers in Christ.  \n\nThe open letter by Paul Kerr can be viewed at: www.johningalls.com/ARTRA/PaulKerrOnTheBody.pdf\n\n#johningalls\n#localchurch \n#lordsrecovery \n#thelordsrecovery \n#thelocalchurch",

      "description": "Today I read the book \u0022A Response to Recent Accusations\u0022 by Ron Kangas and Kerry Robichaux (Living Stream Ministry, 1989), that, as usual, broke my heart. I want oneness and peace, and I believe so do countless of my brothers and sisters who have reached out for fellowship about deeply offensive and wounding practices, behaviors and words too common among leaders in \u0022the Lord\u0027s Recovery.\u0022 Others desiring peace and oneness have been driven away by the cruel abuse experienced or witnessed in the church, and never spoke out publicly. I know many. And, yes, I put quotes around \u0022the Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022, because I don\u0027t believe my Lord would treat my brothers and sisters the way they have been and are being treated by many leaders in \u0022the\u0022 church, and anything abusive should never be called \u0022Recovery\u0022. So I ask you brothers, as you asked John Ingalls at the end of your book: \u0022We invite our brother[s] to treat this matter seriously and to take that proper biblical and human course of action that will produce genuine peace between [themselves] and the Body.\u0022 Many members of the Body have been and are extremely stumbled by the lack of accountability, the lack of righteousness, justice, and love toward ALL members - without partiality. Instead, there has been falsehood, gaslighting, mockery, sexual misconduct, financial corruption, defaming and despising of believers.... and I am asking that all of this get cleared up through repentance.",

Churches in Taiwan and other countries in the Far East suffered similarly, and then the corruption continued in the United States. \n\nIt is a worthy endeavor to support Christian laborers, but there should be righteous handling of finances with transparency and accountability. Financial management and decisions should not be corrupt or illegal nor covered up by teachings related to covering brothers and submitting to deputy authority. \n\nSome in \u201Cthe Lord\u2019s Recovery\u201D are excessively wealthy, while others are in dire poverty. Leading brothers typically enjoy significant salaries and comfortable lifestyles, with protection from any accountability under the teaching of \u201CGod\u2019s government.\u201D Sadly, the most wealthy in the church seem also to enjoy special treatment, in my observation. And the needy ones, who still hand everything over to the God they live and serve, are blessed if tree from the love of money, but are too often abused while being expected to submit to \u201Cauthority.\u201D \n\nAnd if Christians speak out, related to matters that provoke their conscience, or if it gets too painful and unsustainable for victims of spiritual, marital, and/or financial abuse, believers in this group may appeal to the legal process, and be driven into deep debt or bankruptcy, seeking justice. \n\n#witnesslee #lordsrecovery #thelocalchurch #localchurch #livingstreamministry #thelordsrecovery #religiousabuse #cultrecovery #loveofmoney",

In this video I try to share a small window into corrupt financial enterprises using believers\u2019 money. Lack of transparency and accountability were - and still are - accepted only due to accepting of a teaching that we should never question God\u2019s \u201Cdeputy authority.\u201D \n\nMany saints have been severely cheated and stumbled by the mishandling of unrighteous mammon.

      "description": "Leaving Seattle soon after a week-long visit here, while reflecting on various experiences I had while living here as a child, teenager, and for about 14 months more recently as an adult, and pondering many experiences, observations and written records of dear ones since that time, my heart is bursting with so much truth to speak in love, to anyone to whom such truth could be freeing.\n\nReading an article from CRI written in 1994 called \u201CTurmoil in the Local Church\u201D makes it clear that even \u201Coutsiders\u201D were clear that the \u201Croot of the church\u2019s grievance\u201D was related to the failure to deal with Philip Lee\u2019s sinful behavior. Their objective letter is corroborated by all the brothers labeled as \u201Crebellious\u201D in the book The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion. \n\nThat CRI article can be viewed at lcinfo.org/?page=writings/media/turmoil.\n\nYet in 1993 and again in 1996, elders in the church in Anaheim wrote letters of apology to Phillip Lee. These 9 brothers signed a letter stating that they \u201Cdo not believe that the public declaration of those three brothers concerning Philip Lee was justified or proper.\u201D\n\nI don\u2019t know of any apology or repentance from Philip. But elders asked him for forgiveness. Did the elders feel to protect sheep being molested by Philip Lee? No one reached out to me for 30 years, though my name was mentioned by a witness as a victim. What is not proper about publicly reproving an elder after receiving reports from multiple witnesses? (1 Tim. 5:20 says,  \u201C\uFFFCAs for those who persist in sin, rebuke them\uFFFC in the presence of all, so the rest may stand in fear.\u201D) How is rebuking a serial sexual predator in a church not justifiable or proper? How is it \u201Crebellious\u201D to follow God\u2019s Word?\n\nThe full apology letter can be found at blendedbody.com/Hongkong/CIA-Letter2PhilipLee.jpg.\n\n#lordsrecovery \n#witnesslee \n#localchurch \n#spiritualabuse\n#bearingfalsewitness",

      "description": "I recently read on a forum that my videos kind of all say the same thing, or something like that. Forgive me for any wordiness or repetition. \n\nWhat am I hoping for in posting these videos\u2026 so feeble and too repetitive and unimpressively simple? \n\nWhat have dozens of sincere, devout believers hoped for, who have raised awareness - or tried to- of patterns of sinning in \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery\u201D and of the covering up of those sins?\n\nI have heard a highly respected (that in itself being problematic...)\u0022senior co-worker\u0022 mocking an older brother who  confronted Brother Lee about some of the gross sins being covered up.  The \u0022senior coworker\u0022  mimicked how that elderly brother said he had to \u0022deeeaal with his conscience\u0022 (lowering his voice very deeply like that faithful brother\u0027s voice) - making a joke about such a phrase and scorning the brother. Dealing with our conscience is not something to mock. It is essential to keep the oneness and for us to properly love one another - the new commandment, by  which all men know that we are Jesus\u0027 disciples.\n\nI hope these videos and my blog (inconvenientruth.com) would join with the voices of many other dear and faithful believers who have not been able to remain silent about intolerable and unreal with sins. Many voices were silenced. Many who\u2019ve spoken out have been publicly shamed and lied about. Such ones face spiritual abuse. Many have lost precious friends and family members due to misrepresentation. \n\nBut silence is not an option once one\u2019s conscience is provoked, when the Lord in us is turning over tables in what should be house of prayer, but has become a den of thieves (Matt. 21:13; Mark 11:17; Luke 19:46). \n\nThe goal of every single video and every single blog I post is \u201Clove, which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith\u201D (1 Tim. 1:5). \n\nTo have healthy love for one another, we need a pure heart and a good conscience and sincere faith. I learned as a little child how to take care of my conscience and it\u2019s something that no believer should ever graduate from. \n\nI pray that any involved would humble ourselves and pray and seek God\u2019s face and turn from our wicked ways, that God would hear and forgive and heal our land (2 Chron. 7:14).\n\n#localchurch \n#witnesslee \n#lordsrecovery \n#spiritualabuse\n#denofrobbers",

      "description": "Many times in my 20\u2019s, I heard Witness Lee say that we (especially elders and other leading ones) should just be his tape recorders, that they shouldn\u2019t speak anything new - just what Witness Lee has said. In my youth this didn\u2019t sound right. It sounded controlling, diminishing and limiting of all the members of the church, each with their precious portions and experiences and light from God\u2019s Word. \n\nOne may reason such things away, justifying them by various verses like Paul saying to the Philippians that we should all speak the same thing. But he didn\u2019t charge them to say only what he said. I\u2019ve heard the exposition that Paul means we should all speak Christ - the multifaceted, unsearchable, measureless riches of Christ and goodness of God\u2026 and we need eternity for that. NOT as tape recorders but as those with a personal knowing and seeing of Christ and all the riches in God\u2019s Word.\n\nTo have an attitude that we can only speak with another person, a leader, has spoken can very easily become culty - controlling, and totalitarian, etc.\n\nI am off to meet with believers, but thought I would post this for fellowship among anyone who wants to participate.

      "description": "Without partiality and favoritism I feel to keep speaking out about multiple cases in which responsible ones in the Local Church and in \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery\u201D did not deal properly with sins. These are not victimless sins. They damage the hearts and families of targets and victims. The damage can extend even for generations. The damage doesn\u2019t disappear or heal with silence, but through applying God\u2019s Word faithfully, which involves rebuking and reproving, in the case of leading ones, publicly, and they\u2019re being repentance and forgiveness.\n\nThe practice in the Lords recovery has been to publicly rebuke people who speak out, and to quarantine them and label them as poisonous and negative. I am not poisonous or negative. I can\u2019t tolerate these patterns in what is being called \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery.\u201D Lives are being destroyed. \n\nBrothers, what is the motive of stank silent about these improprieties and sins? Is it because of partiality towards certain families? Is it because of financial gain that may be affected if people hold you accountable? \n\nWe live before the Lord. It is better to deal with offenses and sins in this age, while we are still on our way home to meet the Lord.\n\nI\u2019d like to add, related the sexual abuse my daughter experienced from a son of Ben Phillips, Jr.:\n\n1) Brother Ben, when you made that appeal at your dad\u2019s memorial for those who have \u201Cleft\u201D to \u201Ccome back\u201D - brother, if we left a particular gathering of believers because we weren\u2019t safe, we weren\u2019t protected by leaders, and we were ignored and/or shamed if we spoke out, how/why would we return to that environment? And I refuse to call such an environment \u201Cthe\u201D church\u2026. Yes, the church in Corinth had problems, but hopefully they were dealt with properly and thoroughly by leaders. Eventually their testimony faded. Eventually the lampstand was removed from the church in Ephesus. You can have the right name but not be the reality of a church as a lampstand. \n\n2) I am not speaking about this matter to shame any minors in the church. They need care and shepherding and protection and guidance from the older ones. Both my daughter and this other young person, were suffering, deep depression and family-related pain. They found a lot of solace in being together and talking honestly together. But personal boundaries should always be honored. When my daughter asked for help, help could\u2019ve been given, but her appeals were ignored.\n\n3) To Christy\u2019s grandparents, Willie and Rosalind Wise, she opened to you about her being molested. You told her to not say anything about it, but to cover the family. You should have protected your granddaughter (or any other victim opening to you) - not the image of a high profile family. We should protect every victim of sexual violence, assault, and harassment, without partiality or favoritism.\n\nTo all, this is a PATTERN in \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery\u201D and it is not sustainable. There needs to be proper rebuking and repenting and forgiveness and restoration in cases such as those I mention in this video. \n\n#thelocalchurch \n#lordsrecovery",

      "description": "In this video, I speak out about a member of my spiritual family, who has not been shepherded properly to repent and to be restored to the fellowship, but rather his sins that have stumbled many, and his disappearance that grieves even more of us, are all covered up and \u0022not spoken about\u0022 (except in small circles). This is contrary to GOD\u0027S Word, which says, \u0022Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses. But those elders who are sinning you are to reprove before everyone, so that the others may take warning.  I charge you, in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, to keep these instructions without partiality, and to do nothing out of favoritism\u0022 (I Tim. 5:19-21).\n\nI am just a \u0022little\u0022 (53-year-old) sister but I can\u0027t bear the lack of practicing what is in God\u0027s Word, in the name of \u0022covering brothers,\u0022 in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery.\u0022 What about protecting endangered wives? What about comforting heart-broken children and grandchildren? What about loving one another enough to reprove publicly, for there to be public warning and public repentance and full forgiveness and restoration?\n\nThere should be no favoritism, no partiality. If you rebuke brothers publicly who are maintaining a clean conscience, speaking truthfully, but whose speaking may tarnish the reputation of an individual or an organization, but you are covering up gross sins of leading brothers, trying to hide the truth, that is partiality.\n\nAs long as I am alive, I won\u0027t stand by, but I will speak up and speak out the truth... the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God. We are ALL affected by lies in our communities and especially in the church (composed of ALL believers), including lies of ommission, and by the loss of the function of fellow members who fall into sin or are excommunicated for speaking up about sins that need to be dealt with scripturally.\n\nTo the brother I address, and to his family, I hope you receive my words in this public way only from my heart of love and my deep desire for restoration and for preservation of the Lord\u0027s testimony and genuine oneness, apart from sin, among ALL His believers, wherever and with whomever we may be practically meeting.\n\nLove finds no joy in unrighteousness but rejoices in the truth (1 Cor. 13:6).\n\n#lordsrecovery \n#thelocalchurch \n#witnesslee \n#cultrecovery",

Our oneness should not depend on any special affiliation to one particular ministry and the exclusion of others\u0027 ministries.\n\nAnd we should not use godliness as a means for financial gain (1 Tim. 6:5).\n\nIf a church (\u0022THE church\u0022) is required to have/speak/read only \u0022one ministry,\u0022 based on one or two brothers\u0027 speaking, and a non-profit publishing company is very enmeshed with THE church, financially and practically, and that publishing company sells only those two brothers\u0027 writings, there is a huge incentive to silence anything that would cause serious, legitimate and scriptural concerns among followers regarding the publishing company, the churches, and especially leading ones including the \u0022commander\u0022 (Elders Training Book 7, 1986, bibleread.online/all-books-by-Watchman-Nee-and-Witness-Lee/book-elders-training-book-07-one-accord-for-the-lords-move-Witness-Lee-read-online/6/).\n\n[From that same Elders Training book just cited, here are 2 pertinent paragraphs I didn\u0027t read in the  video:\n\n\u0022Some saints came to me a number of times with reports concerning serious and even negative situations. They may have misunderstood my not responding to them with any kind of seriousness. I believe I did not respond in this way not only out of my patience and toleration but also because of the Lord\u2019s wisdom. I feel that it is altogether wise to be patient. When the fruit of a particular tree is growing, the fruit itself will show what it is. When the fruit becomes ripe, it will fall from the tree. At this point, however, I do not feel that I should tolerate certain situations any longer, because enough damage has been done already. I do not like to see more damage done to the Lord\u2019s recovery. I have no time, dear saints, to fool around with people any longer. Let us go to fight the battle. Who are the \u201Cus\u201D? They are the ones who are desperate with no opinion.\n\nand...\n\u0022It is altogether not wise for you to remain in the recovery taking this ministry on the one hand and yet on the other hand to say something else. This is not wise. It is not profitable to yourself or to your future. You may say that you have a ministry, but this is not profitable to your ministry if you have one. You can never profit your ministry in the future in this way. Rather, you have dispensed your future in a cheap way. The wise way is to stay, without any opinion, with the recovery, which is unique.\u0022]\n\nIf there is abuse in THE church and/or in the Ministry office of the publication company, to remain \u0022faithful\u0022 in the church and \u0022faithful to the ministry\u0022  - or \u0022one with the ministry\u0022  - seems to require that you look the other way rather than confront and deal with stumbling sin. Such \u0022oneness\u0022 of \u0022the Body\u0022 is actually a loyalism to a corrupt system/organization with a financial conflict of interest. \n\nI don\u0027t do justice in this video (nor in any video)... but hopefully this is a start.\n\nAdd to this the fact that much money is brought in by the activities of the Living Stream Ministry that supports many \u0022faithful to the ministry.\u0022 What if such ones were to say, \u0022Sin is not acceptable. Sexual harrassment is illegal and should be dealt with seriously.\u0022 Would they lose their financial support? Would they be shunned?\n\nOh, wait, this happened. And such ones were labeled \u0022rebellious\u0022 and \u0022poisonous\u0022 and lied about and excommunicated (\u0022quarantined\u0022).\n\nWe were cheated from their ministry - which I believe each and every member of Christ\u0027s body has.\n\nOur oneness must not depend on oneness with anyone other than the Triune God. If it is, we are very likely in a cult.\n\n#witnesslee \n#lordsrecovery \n#thelocalchurch \n#cultrecovery",

Very trained therapists I have had have said that minimally, I have been treated in cult-like ways over the years... and I know this to be true. I watched \u0022Scientology and Its Aftermath\u0022 with tears streaming down my face during some episodes, being able to identify with victims speaking out, or of whom others were speaking. As believers and as doers of God\u0027s Word, cult-like behaviors should not be characteristic of our practices.\n\nIn this video, I mainly read from a webpage of an international authority on cults, Janja Lalich (janjalalich.com/help/characteristics-associated-with-cults/).\n\nI also make a few feeble comments with a few examples of experiences, practices and observations that align to these characteristics, practiced in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022/\u0022The Local Churches\u0022. If I said more, and I have a lot more to say, the video would get too long.\n\nFor many, including myself for many years, it is hard to hear these words until/unless you reach a point in your life where destructive treatment directed at you or at someone you love is no longer bearable... then in order to heal, you begin to face the facts and to think soberly and, yes, critically, about your community, your choices (or lack thereof), the consequences of your choices, and how all of that compares to the characteristics of cults.",

Otherwise, dear ones will continue being stumbled. I posted this after watching https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5DnzEM-6xmA\u0026pp=ygUcTG90ZCdzIHJlY292ZXJ5IGN1bHQgZXhwb3NlZA%3D%3D\u2026 Like this brother, I don\u2019t like to be sharing these things, but there\u2019s been too much damage to hide it or to let it continue without speaking up. That\u2019s what any responsible community member should do if they are exposed to abuse.",

I am posting this in solidarity with all those who have been disorientingly hurt and potentially stumbled by a group whose leaders (not all - but TOO many leaders) cover up blantant and abhorrent sins, blame victims, hush witnesses, treat wives as dispensable and disposable... all while claiming to be \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 and THE church. I couldn\u0027t survive without the church, and am being cared for in the church... just not by Christians who claim to be against division while tolerating all that divides, and who treat those who speak out as if they are the problem. Whistleblowers are NOT the problem. We are seeking to be part of the solution, a solution that cannot save the image of unrepentant perpetrators and complicit responsible ones.",

To work through this, to share my experience, to \u0022tell the church\u0022, and to expose works of darkness, I will be posting videos - unedited and imperfect. They will be based on journal entries and on any current experiences. They are FACTUAL. I am accused of lying by those who don\u0027t want the truth exposed. There is NO lie in these videos; there is the honest mistake- I mispoke in this video; this was filmed on January 14, 2024, not the 13th.  \n\nThis video reflects on an appointment I had on February 21, 2019, with someone very well-respected in the church community in which I was raised and which was my most important circle  - until I was ostracized by my husband, his family, and eventually nearly everyone in that community to whom I turned for help.",
