I highlight the author\u0027s thoroughly researched accounts on who Watchman Nee was, some about his ministry as the undisputed leader in \u0022The Little Flock\u0022, as well as some of the sex scandals in which Watchman Nee was involved, that are denied/covered up by many followers to this day, because though Nee admitted to them in writing, and though they are corroborated by victim statements, he never confessed them to the church, and those who knew never publicly reproved him, that all may take warning, as the Bible guides us to do. Following God\u0027s Word, though difficult in such situations in which leaders are involved in sexual sins including raping women, reduces the amount and level of stumbling, and can lead to repentance of perpetrators, healing of victims, and learning of all. \n\nProfessor Xi credits Nee\u0027s stenographer and secretary of over 20 years (1932-1952) and others who knew Nee well, for much firsthand, eye-witness information published in this book.\n\nMore to come in my next video, Watchman Nee \u0026 Witness Lee in book \u0022Redeemed by Fire\u0022 (2010) - Part 2.\n\n#watchmannee #witnesslee #lordsrecovery #thelocalchurch #livingstreamministry",

      "description": "Many in leadership positions, with more \u0022power\u0022 than other members, act like they are taking the high road to not say anything: to not \u0022revile,\u0022 not to \u0022justify themselves\u0022... They may reference 1 Peter 2, which says, \u0022Reviled, He did not revile in return...\u0022 But the context is: \u0022If you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God. To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps. \u0027He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.\u0027 When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly...\u0022  The main point is that we are to suffer for doing GOOD, and we can refrain from returning insults, committing everything to God who judges righteously.  This is not justification for sinning and then being silent to those confronting us for sinning. And NO ONE should be unaccountable to others for their sins - especially  people in positions of church leadership.\n\nSee www.youtube.com/watch?v=848phJ-5wow for a clip of Witness Lee sharing how he said nothing while being accused of being a thief. He was actually accused of being involved in very offensive things, and never acknowledged that, while leading his audience to believe that he had done nothing sinful, and that he was taking the high road amidst false accusations. \n\nI never feel I do justice on these topics. Hopefully the fellowship in the comments can do better than I can do in videos.\n\n#thelocalchurch #livingstreamministry #localchurches #witnesslee",

No. \n\nThere is Jesus, who fulfilled all the types and prophecies in the Old Testament. Through His death and resurrection He accomplished redemption, and having ascended, He produced His one Body. He gave gifts to His Body... but NO gift was ever to be in the place of Moses or any other Old Testament figure. \n\nYet \u0022the Ministry\u0022 in \u0022the Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 makes Brother Nee, Brother Lee, and Brother We (\u0022THE blended brothers\u0022 - also very unscriptural - God has blended HIS BODY together - not certain brothers) analogous to Moses, and any who speak against their leadership as being like Miriam, Korah, Dathan, and Abihu. This is so evil and heretical, putting certain members of the Body over other members and in the place of the Head.\n\n#thelocalchurch #livingstreamministry #thelordsrecovery #lordsrecovery #localchurches #watchmannee #witnesslee #blendedbrothers #blendedcoworkers",

He is able to carry us through anything.\n\nI grew up in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery.\u0022 I grew up around one dear one who frequently spoke of suicide. She saw her dad excommunicated. She was called a \u0022bad apple\u0022 when she was in 6th-9th grade..... In my adult life I was often around another dear one who spoke frequently of suicide, though he was still sitting on front rows in church \u0022meetings\u0022 and speaking from the podium. I lost a cousin to suicide. I can count several young, middle aged and even older adults who have died by suicide, who either grew up in, or who were, at their time of death, considered as active members of \u0022the local church\u0022/\u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022. I am privy to so many who have contemplated dying prematurely and purposefully, rather than living, due to pressures and abuses in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery.\u0022 \n\nI am not blaming any person nor organization/institution for any tragic death, nor for any suicidal crises which anyone has survived. I don\u0027t believe anyone should blame, nor be blamed. But we should all be reflective. \n\nAnd... I want to be very clear that for many genuine, empathetic image-bearers of their Creator and Savior, \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 has proven to be an extremely toxic and hostile environment.

      "description": "If certain people were not idolized in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022, and if instead, there were NO respect of persons, but only allegiance and devotion to God Himself and to His Word, to the truth, including that there should be the same care for ALL believers, I believe many of the current problems in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 would not exist. \n\nNo one would be above the law. No one would be unaccountable. There would not be double standards, nor lies about truth-tellers. Those who expose evil works of darkness would be viewed as faithful witnesses, like Antipas. Those who speak the truth in love would be patterns to others - not on a pedestal, but as healthy and normal believers, patterns of the flock. \n\nInstead, truth tellers are excommunicated and called poisonous, rebellious, leprous; they are cursed by leaders who seem to have immunity from the commandments of God. Leaders who are sinning, or whose family members are sinning, are considered untouchable, with the twisting of Scriptures, teaching congregants to \u0022cover Noah\u0022, meaning to not even see, let alone speak about, anything evil being done by leaders in \u0022the local churches\u0022 - especially \u0022God\u0027s deputy authority\u0022 - human, idolized, often self-exalted (but other-exalted is also evil) leaders. Verses like \u0022\u0022Do not touch my anointed, and do my prophets no harm\u0022 (1 Chron. 16:22) are unscripturally used to protect sinning elders. \n\nIn the New Testament, all believers are anointed. All believers are prophets. There is not a special class of those who are untouchable, nor are there those about whom leaders can lie to protect the image of their organization, family, leadership, fellow leaders, or themselves. \n\nExalting people is idolatry. That is respecting of persons. God is no respecter of persons, and God shows no partiality (Acts 10:34; Rom. 2:11). \n\n\u0022This royal law is found in the Scriptures: \u0027Love your neighbor as you love yourself.\u0027 If you obey this law, you are doing right. But if you treat one person as being more important than another, you are sinning. You are guilty of breaking God\u2019s law.\u0022 James 2:8-9\n\n#lordsrecovery #livingstreamministry #thelocalchurch #witnesslee #idolatry #favoritism",

      "description": "In the preface of the Living Stream Hymn book (1966), it says that the hymns in that hymn book are freely available for the use of all the children of God. John Ingalls authored around 200 of those hymns, and was primarily responsible for the compilation and preparation of that hymn book. \n\nYet in the 1980\u0027s and onward, after John Ingalls had gone repeatedly to Witness Lee about the immoral practices of Philip Lee (Witness Lee\u0027s son then manager of the Living Stream Ministry), he was ostracized and falsely accused. When John began to gather with believers, after being cast away by Witness Lee and his followers from \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022, he requested permission to (re)print hymns he had written. John Ingalls was denied permission to print his own hymns for the use of a congregation of believers with whom he was meeting.\n\nI can find no other explanation for such denial of usage of one\u0027s hymns except for financial motivation and abuse of power (control) by the publishing company. Why otherwise would believers - especially hymns\u0027 author - be prohibited from printing and using hymns in their worship of the Father and praise of the Son?\n\nThis, among so many other details of abuses, is very disheartening to me. Our brother John Ingalls is now with the Lord. He never publicized these abuses. But I am, because I have witnessed and experienced firsthand some of the damages of abusive behavior by Living Stream Ministry and leading ones who subscribe to this publishing company.\n\n#livingstreamministry #witnesslee #johningalls #localchurches\n#thelocalchurch #thelordsrecovery",

Bystanders are co-victims, or can also be co-perpetrators, depending on their response. Either way, they can suffer anxiety, depression, and other effects.

      "description": "It has been said, as a response to why someone advocating for me had been stonewalled by a senior coworker, that I am \u0022in close association with Jo Casteel.\u0022 I have never spoken with Jo, that I know of, and sent her a FB message a couple of years ago, to which she never responded. But as I read her letter, I realize how much Jo put into the 28 pages that she labored on and posted as an open letter; she and her late husband had much clarity about unconscionable matters that are commonplace in the community in which she and I both were raised.\n\nIn this video, I only read the first 7 of 28 pages that comprise Jo\u0027s open letter. I am full of gratitude to Jo for her courage to address many matters that MUST be addressed if believers with whom we associated are to know the truth about a system of error, that traps dear, sincere believers who do not want to practice anything unscriptural, but who also may be exposed to practices and teachings that they cannot reconcile with God\u0027s word or their consciences.\n\nI recorded this after I wrote this blog: www.inconvenientruth.com/post/she-s-in-close-association-with-jo-casteel\n\nHere is a page that leads to Jo\u0027s letter and other resources: www.mylocalchurchexperience.com/jo-casteel-s-open-letter\n\n#lordsrecovery \n#localchurch \n#livingstreamministry",

      "description": "Please note: This video could be so much longer, with MANY examples of/connections to what is read and alluded to. Please feel free to add comments to help complete this feeble attempt at addressing a big topic.\n\nSome people accuse me of both quoting from Watchman Nee books and Witness Lee books, while also speaking about evil and corruption in their lives, based on multiple firsthand witnesses, and in the movement with which they are associated/founders (\u0022the local churches\u0022/\u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022). For this video, I will likely receive such criticism. \n\nI will repeat as many times as necessary, if it helps: I am against abuse, corruption, hypocrisy, stumbling, covered up sin, and violating God\u0027s Word. I am FOR the Lord and everything that is His/of Him.\n\nIn this video, I share some points and excerpts from the book \u0022Spiritual Authority\u0022, also called \u0022Authority and Submission\u0022, by Watchman Nee. \n\nToo many words in this book that are according to the Bible are contradicted in patterns and practices of \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022. \u0022Authority figures\u0022  - even someone more uniquely called \u0022God\u0027s Deputy Authority\u0022 (\u0022The Minister/Apostle of the Age\u0022, The Wise Master Builder\u0022, \u0022God\u0027s Oracle\u0022...) have excommunicated God-fearing members who obey God rather than men, labeling them as \u0022rebellious\u0022 when these members recognize a discrepancy between practices/teachings of \u0022delegated authority\u0022 and God\u0027s Word, and when these members scripturally address and expose works of darkness. \n\nThere are also words in this book that directly contradict God\u0027s Word.\n\nI share a few main points with excerpts from the book:\n1. Authority is for enforcing God\u0027s/human law - maintaining/rewarding good and punishing evil.\n2. God alone receives our unqualified obedience\n3. When there is unrighteousness and misrepresenting of God, men should obey God rather than men.\n4. All members in the body are taught in God\u0027s Word to be subject/submissive to one another.\n5. If someone thinks/feels to be an authority, that one is not worthy to be that authority (p. 165).\n6. Two points that contradict the above, and contradict God\u0027s Word:\na) We shouldn\u0027t care about right or wrong/good or evil, but rather just obey delegated authority; and \nb) God and delegated authority are inseparable.\n\nIt should be noted that the examples of authority used in this book are nearly entirely from the Old Testament - all which prophesied concerning Jesus, the fulfillment of all types, figures, and every positive thing. In the New Testament, all believers are anointed as the universal priesthood and baptized into one Body to be members of Christ\u0027s Body, under our one Head. We are taught to submit to one another, not be as the Gentiles who exercise authority over one another, but rather to be servants.... There are so many other New Testament verses that endorse discerning and abhorring and exposing what is evil, and doing good, clinging to what is good, not lording it over anyone...\n\nFor more clarity on this topic, I highly recommend: Lance Ford\u0027s sharing at www.youtube.com/watch?v=w08a1eGIaTc (also at julieroys.com/podcast/honor-culture-matthew-18-how-to-control-the-masses/.\n\n#thelocalchurch \n#livingstreamministry \n#thelordsrecovery",

      "description": "Ever since I began speaking up in these past months about my having been sexually assaulted by Philip Lee when I was 16 and he was the manager of the Living Stream Ministry, a couple \u0022Blended Brothers\u0022 fell silent, though up to that point, at various stages they seemed willing to try help me in my marriage crisis. I and other advocates reaching out to them became stonewalled. Not one \u0022responsible brother\u0022 - let alone any responsible one from the 1987 time period, ever asked me about what happened, in spite of a whistleblower\u0027s report, and no one has apologized for what I went through. Other victims moved away and/or disappeared. \n\nThank God for those brothers, who endured being labeled rebellious and being lied about, even in Living Stream Ministry publications. \n\nI\u0027ve been thinking of the collateral damages incurred through sexual abuse, particularly in a church community or other religious community that is your support system, your social circle, and your family/home in a sense. The actual families of victims are severely impacted, multigenerationally.\n\nI have been wondering if Philip Lee had any thought of all the lives he was damaging when he assaulted me and other sisters. I wonder if his dad who defended him realized the longterm effects of sexual assault on an individual, family, and community.\n\nI decided to write - and share - a song, to the tune of \u0022Mary, Did You Know?\u0022 but called \u0022Philip, Did You Know?\u0022 The recording is rough; I can\u0027t belt it out fully, with others in the home.

The code of silence and the punishment of a victim. and a victim\u0027s family who supports the victim, coming forward to expose perpetrators can be at the indescribable loss of one\u0027s community, one\u0027s reputation, one\u0027s identity... in addition to suffering of the actual sexual abuse.\n\nSpecial thanks to the Waks family, especially Manny and his parents, for their courage and solidarity in speaking up and standing for justiice.\n\nThe documentary can currently be watched on Amazon and on Youtube (www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNMEmt8ymCE).\n\n\n#tsedek\n#mesirah\n#breakthesilence",

It seems that in both circles, there are some in power that will not tolerate believers who speak the truth about covered-up sins, though they may, to their faces, be nice, and though they teach about love.

I felt to share a few of the entries, to demonstrate how my life WAS the meetings... and this was largely the case all through my life, except for about a year, from 1988-1989, when even my dad encouraged me not to go to the Anaheim church meetings because there was so much turmoil... and then when/after I was ostracized by my husband and his family and eventually most others in \u0022the church\u0022; since November 2018 I have not attended more than 5 \u0022meetings\u0022 of \u0022the\u0022 church (\u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022/\u0022the local church\u0022) in any city.

I look at the Hebrew words involved in the phrase \u0022Knowledge of Good and Evil\u0022 - a phrase so pervasively interpreted by Living Stream Ministry and by the local churches as meaning that Knowledge, Good and Evil are ALL on the SAME tree and EACH and ALL result in death... (and that death is worse than sin...) and this is contrary to the Word of God.\n\nSuch a teaching is used to silence those who report wrongdoing and who scripturally address sin; one is frequently told that they are on the \u0022wrong tree\u0022 when they discern that something is evil; \u0022knowledge, good, and evil ALL end in death, and death is more serious than sin\u0022 so the person confronting sin is by implication more offensive to God than the sinning one, because s/he is, by virtue of discerning and addressing unrighteousness, in DEATH, of death, spreading death.......\n\nThis teaching is a HERESY, and along with the teaching of \u0022God\u0027s deputy authority\u0022 in the church and \u0022the covering of Noah\u0022, serves to protect predators and silence victims in this community.\n\n#livingstreamministry #thelordsrecovery #thelocalchurch",

I hadn\u0027t interacted with her for a couple of years, mainly because of what I find to be distressing misapplication of God\u0027s precious Word. But after the Restore 2025 conference I felt to reply to a text from her, and the ensuing text exchange exemplifies this group\u0027s treatment of abuse. She didn\u0027t\u0027 mention the 2 trees, and how good and evil are on the same tree, but she says that Satan mainly comes through our self, mind, and soul-life to attack and damage the church, after I mentioned sexual molestation. And the fact that I am mentioning this seems to be assumed as my living in offenses and not letting others crucify me. \n\nNo. I won\u0027t let any of God\u0027s sheep be damaged under my watch, if I can do anything about it. And these videos and my blog are part of my speaking and holding the truth in love so that abuse will stop and God\u0027s people would be safe in God\u0027s house.\n\n#livingstreamministry #thelordsrecovery #thelocalchurch #thelocalchurches\n#witnesslee",

The Spirit is definitely speaking to the churches, for the preparation of Christ\u0027s Bride, for whom He gave Himself, in order to present the church to Himself glorious... \n\nI cannot describe the level of comfort, nourishment, refreshment and blessing I am experiencing here with so many believers from 41 states and 9 countries. \n\nThe time opened this morning with some worship; the guitarist read Jesus prayer in John 17... including, \u0022...that they all may be one...\u0022 His prayer is being answered as we are all healed and as sin and abuse - ALL works of darkness - are shined away.\n\nI was able to meet and speak with Julie Roys, and am hoping soon to have her and her staff investigate \u0022the Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022, especially related to all of the sexual, emotional and spiritual abuse I and so many others have experienced from leaders who should be protecting the sheep, but who instead prey on - or ignore/condemn the cries of - the sheep.\n\nI told Julie Roys today that I am partly here to represent older members of an abusive church community. who have faithfully spoken the truth for decades... and who have, as a result, been shamed and shunned and ex-communicated by their (fellow) leaders. \n\nHere are a few quotes from my notes, from the session with Dr. Diane Langberg today: \u0022Any pretense that sin is somehow tolerable is choosing to infect and poison the Body of my Lord.... Knowledge of the truth is the only antidote for deceit... \u0027What you have done to the least of these, you have done to ME.\u0027 If we stay silent about abuse in the church, we invite wolves. We are protecting a system, not His name. Our hearts are not made for systems but for God Himself.\u0022\n\nAnd a (rough - from my notes) quote from Mary DeMuth today: \u0022When God is in a thing, it has the FRUIT of the Spirit. There is \u0027love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control\u0027 - THAT is the measure of a ministry.\u0022\n\n#Restore2025\n#churchtoo #spiritualabuse #thelordsrecovery #thelocalchurch #livingstreamministry",

      "description": "On my way to the stables today, a recent favorite song came on the radio, \u0022Something Better\u0022 (by Blanca, with Tauren Wells). As I considered that song, and the sermon I heard this morning, in which was mentioned that God gets all the glory, I considered the matter of glory and shame. If God gets ALL the glory, and Satan gets ALL the shame, then there really is no reason for any problems among believers. \n\nIf ALL glory goes to God, then we don\u0027t have an \u0022image\u0022 we are trying to protect. We care for the truth, for righteousness, for loving treatment of others because GOD cares about those things, and we are in His image... but we don\u0027t seek to GAIN glory from ANY person, nor do we GIVE glory to ANY person.\n\nI believe ALL problems among believers are due to our giving anyone other than God the glory, and due to people thinking that any admission of guilt or fault is somehow shameful (and if people are seeking glory, they can\u0027t bear to be associated with shame...). \n\nConfessing (admitting) our sins - telling the truth, God then gets the glory; He solved our problems of sins! Jesus died that our sins could ALL be forgiven! And Satan gets all the shame - because he is the loser who comes to break in, kill, destroy, divide, damage, abuse, harrass, lie about.... precious image bearers of God.\n\nNarcissism, I believe, is people, hiding a lot of deep inner shame, trying to get glory. And divisions and many problems among believers occur when people give man glory - not God alone - which is idolatry. \n\nLet\u0027s give God ALL the glory, let\u0027s cast all blame and shame on the evil one, Satan. The enemy of God has no place in the light, where there is love and truth and life.... So, let\u0027s be honest, truthful, repenting of any sin to one another and to God... Oh, may the love and life of our Savior God flow among us and heal.\n\nSo I share a few of these thoughts in this video, and a couple songs to the beating of Ranger\u0027s hooves. :) \n\nAbba, YOURS is the glory!

I am speaking out because silence is complicity and all of us deserve to be safe, deserve to be protected, and deserve the truth.\n\nAbusers, if you are still alive, it is not too late to repent.

Shunning of believers who express legitimate, scripture-based concerns\n2. Teaching that right and wrong, good and evil, all are on the same tree and result in death\n3. Teaching that the ground of oneness IS meeting as \u0022THE church in [city name], that meeting in that way is the only way to not be in division, is superior/exclusively scriptural, etc.\n4. Covering up sins, particularly of leaders\n5. Shaming people with thought-terminating cliches, like \u0022take the cross\u0022 (though spoken by Jesus, I believe these words are commonly misapplied, used to hurt and shame believers in this group), and \u0022get out of your mind\u0022....\n\n\n#lordsrecovery #thelocalchurch #livingstreamministry",

What a comfort and blessing.\n\nThis declaration (read in 2 parts, 2 videos) is so clear and factual... unlike the baseless claims made in \u0022The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion\u0022 to which this declaration partly responds.\n\nThank you to the elders, the shepherds, who wrote this statement, that resonates still, and is helpful to me, 35 years later. I hope it helps others, too, who may have been hurt and stumbled by some of the matters addressed in this declaration.",

      "description": "The letter I read in this video, shared with me by \u0022Priestly Scribe\u0022 (on Youtube and other social media platforms), was written about 4 1/2 years ago, by Don Hardy, to fellow former members of \u0022the local church.\u0022 At the time of his writing of this letter, Don Hardy was about 90 years old. He went to be with the Lord this past autumn, and was a total lover and enjoyer of Jesus to the end of his earthly days, from my reading of his many pages of testimony and even hearing his joyful voice on recordings... in addition to this letter. \n\nDon Hardy was one of the only ones (or maybe THE only one) who directly witnessed BOTH Timothy Lee and Philip Lee, at separate times, in sexually immoral acts, and who much later, reported these in writing. Don Hardy worked directly with Witness Lee since the early 1960s, and watched firsthand multiple business ventures in which Witness Lee, with his sons Timothy and Philip Lee, engaged, including Daystar - a luxury RV company (see thumbnail photo and website link below); the Lee family finally became very wealthy, multimillionaires, through the non-profit Witness Lee ran with his son Philip: Living Stream Ministry. \n\nDon Hardy was warned as a young believer in his 20s about the perilous snares faced by Christian workers: pride, mishandling of money, and sexual temptations. His letter I share in this video is written to encourage all \u0022former\u0022 members of \u0022the local church\u0022 to continue to contend for the faith once for all delivered and entrusted to God\u0027s holy people (Jude 3), while also being warned about these snares.\n\nI am so thankful for so many dear believers who did not remain silent about their experiences and observations, but who have shared - and continue to share - their testimonies, for our admonition, warning, strengthening and encouragement.\n\nPicture: A remaining Daystar RV - one of 16 made with many dear Christians\u0027 (in \u0022the Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 in the early 1970s) donations: www.autoevolution.com/news/1974-dodge-daystar-motorhome-is-a-rare-but-sad-sight-219071.html#agal_0\n\n#lordsrecovery #thelocalchurch #witnesslee #livingstreamministry",

      "description": "After hearing tonight from a brother that there have been recent references to \u0022a sister on the internet\u0022 speaking evil things, or something like that... I felt compelled to speak up - even louder. I look forward to addressing ANYTHING spoken ABOUT me, by men who refuse to speak WITH me about sexual assault at the hands of Philip Lee in 1987, who was in a position of power as manager of the Living Stream Ministry, while I was a 16-year-old, far from my home, in Taipei, and almost alone with this now-KNOWN predator (and at that time a known predator by a select few...) - with only one witness there, who reported this, and shortly after, disappeared from my church community... whom I now know was herself a victim of Philip\u0027s sexual assault, too.\n\nDear brothers have repeatedly tried to deal appropriately and scripturally with this matter (and other matters), and in doing so, were smeared and lied about and ostracized from this \u0022church community\u0022 - that MUST be recognized as a cult by the way leaders are handling such offenses, instead making whistleblowers out to be the offenders - not the sexual predators and liars.\n\nIf \u0022senior\u0022 coworkers in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 refuse to speak with a victim of sexual assault and refuse make things right according to God\u0027s Word, repenting for covering up sin after sin after sin of fellow leading ones in this group, but instead try to smear me, as they have done to so many before me, I will keep addressing EVERY reference they make - of which I am aware, and I look forward to raising more public awareness, through the Roys Report or any other reliable and godly coverage, in the future. \n\nThe darkness cannot overcome the light. And light comes in with the truth. \n\nCovering up abuse is lying by omission. Being aware of abuse (especially systemic, repeated, prolific abuse) and not confronting it is enabling. I will do neither.\n\n[Clarification: When I say in this video that I am stronger than John Ingalls or Steve Isitt, I do not mean that I am stronger than them, but that what I have spoken is likely to be perceived as more inflammatory than what they ever spoke, and yet they have been accused of terrible things\u2026 for having spoken the truth out of a loving concern and a desire for fellowship. My point is that having spoken more \u201Coffensively\u201D than these brothers, I fully expect to be smeared as they have been\u2026. But God knows that I too want what these brothers and many others seek - that sin would be dealt with and love would prevail and oneness actualized/restored. i truly don\u0027t want anyone to be hurt or shamed\u2026 except our one enemy, Satan.]\n\n#thelocalchurch \n#livingstreamministry \n#thelordsrecovery \n#witnesslee \n#philiplee\n#sexualabuse\n#metoomovement \n#churchtoo",

      "description": "A brief blast to the past, though not as brief as I planned. I was inspired by Robert Taylor\u0027s reflections to also reflect a bit, and went to where I store some things to find some artifacts. \n\nI found more from my Young People Trainings, and felt to share them. I actually planned to just share a note I found, that related to Robert Taylor\u0027s recent video on High Demand and High Control (youtu.be/6d9b17eD0UA?si=oIMV0gbSwD_OyfIx) in this group... but then I felt to share more.\n\nThese segments that compose this video provide a bit of context to the \u002784-\u002789 time, in which some elders repeatedly expressed some concerns, and during that period of time were labeled \u0022rebellious\u0022 and \u0022old\u0022 and \u0022dissenting\u0022 - not one with their \u0022husband\u0022 Witness Lee (see previous video posted earlier today, \u0022Deeply Offensive Excerpts from Elders Training\u0022 - youtu.be/SuBZrGEguWI?si=drc07AasNk6wJSQ1). After expressing their concerns as shepherds of the flock, some brothers resigned in these years, including John Ingalls and Al Knoch in 1989 (I believe). The brothers who expressed legitimate concerns about various practices and teachings, some of which this video portray, were BY NO MEANS rebellious, and could NEVER have been accused of being rebellious, except in a High Control group in which they are treated as part of a corporate wife, in an ABUSIVE marriage, to Witness Lee. Again, see the reference of Witness Lee drawing this analogy at bibleread.online/all-books-by-Watchman-Nee-and-Witness-Lee/book-elders-training-book-07-one-accord-for-the-lords-move-Witness-Lee-read-online/4/\n\n#livingstreamministry #lordsrecovery #localchurches #thelocalchurch",

      "description": "After I watched @RobertTaylor\u0027s video tonight (\u0022The exclusion of all publications other than one in the Local Church of Witness Lee\u0022): youtu.be/HBI3YBsCum4?si=UYIgsgl9wB-PSlAw, I felt I also need to respond to \u202A@bandsoflove\u202C, who has accused me of not being concerned about the fallout related to exposing abuse. Are leaders concerned about the \u0022fallout\u0022 if works of darkness are exposed, after they have been hidden and enabled by leaders?\n\nI have no heart for innocent parties to be hurt... but abusers hurt them (us) - NOT the whistleblowers. And they can remain anonymous as long as they choose to, even if legal authorities get involved.\n\nIn this video, I mainly address these particular words of \u202A@bandsoflove\u202C   in recent comments:\n\n\u0022Ruth, you read the letter. You can talk about what I am referring to or keep bringing up the dump truck load of stuff that is in your heart (for which I can truly sympathize). By your responses, I can see why people give up talking with you.  You conclude they don\u0027t want to listen or help. When you type something that is longer than a couple sentences in length, think again what you are doing\u0022 \n\nand:\n\n\u0022Perhaps I\u0027m assuming too much, but your going public with all these videos says to me you exhausted the in-person meetings and wanted a larger audience. One thing that does bother me, is that you don\u0027t seem to care about the fallout. How to deal with abuse of all kinds is complicated. Generally it is not just the actions of the perpetrators. Invariably there are innocent spouses, children, grandchildren, in-laws, etc. You seem to want a public accounting of everything that has happened anywhere in any church. Not everyone does including the actual victims. Especially now that in many cases decades have already passed. If anyone wants to make it a legal or civil matter there are courts that hear those cases. Most of the cases and people you bring up have been dealt with as appropriate by the church leadership. Perhaps not to your timetable or satisfaction, but you weren\u0027t the one on the scene, responsible for it. Thus you don\u0027t know all.  If you want to put your own family out on the internet that is your decision, but I expect even in your own family some are not comfortable with it.\u0022\n\n\nOh... I just saw this one, and didn\u0027t speak to it [yet]:\n\u0022Short is better.   If your comments were directed to my questions, I can read and process that. You are in same boat with Al since you feel you are clear about the state of the Recovery and all people in it and they are poor and degraded and deserving of condemnation. That is not sober minded. Using your own argument, your problem is with individuals not the movement. Stop condemning it wholesale. Some bad apples don\u0027t mean the whole is bad. What church, denomination, school, business, country hasn\u0027t had bad actors. Many of them never brought to account for their actions. Now many of the people who caused the problems aren\u0027t even alive. What do you really want to be done?\u0022\n\nPosting this response to @bandsoflove, also in my comments to your above message... whew! It\u0027s NOT over 3 sentences...\n\n@bandsoflove: If Albert Zehr is not soberminded, I don\u0027t know who is. I am honored to be in his company.\n\nIf the \u0022individuals\u0022 include Watchman Nee - who by the report of multiple victims raped sisters and never repented to the church - and Witness Lee - who repeatedly heard reports of his sons raping and molesting sisters and at the same time gave Philip more and more power and \u0022authority\u0022 in the Living Stream AND in the churches, and who defrauded believers of their life savings and then became extremely materially wealthy - a multi-millionaire - through the Living Stream Ministry... and all those who shame \u0022other\u0022 Christians who don\u0027t follow Watchman Nee and Witness Lee, as being degraded, and lie about and smear brothers who speak the truth, and those who either ARE abusive or who cover up/stay silent about abuse of which they are aware, then, yes, I guess my problem is with individuals.",

      "description": "In this video I read a bit more from Dr. Lily Hsu\u0027s book about her memories from Shanghai Christian Assembly, especially her description of effects (on her and on others) of learning of Watchman Nee\u0027s covered up sins. These sins were largely covered up due to his teachings on \u0022authority and submission\u0022 that guarded him, as a self-proclaimed deputy authority, from being scripturally accountable to other members of the Body of Christ, without impunity. \n\nWatchman Nee taught his followers to submit to him, and that submission means cutting off your head... so no believer was allowed to address genuine concerns or confront him about his sins, his interpretation of scriptures, etc. (Nee, CWWN Vol. 57, ch. 24, sec. 3). And this attitude and such teachings still remain in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 with damaging but accepted practices.\n\nThe covering up of sins can be more stumbling than the sins themselves. To this day, so many sins are still covered up by leaders in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 - continuing the same pattern that stumbled many early believers who followed Watchman Nee in China. We should learn from history, repent, and not keep repeating the same errors.\n\nWe are not stumbled by the fact that King David sinned - because he repented. We are comforted to know that all of us, even King David, a man after God\u0027s heart, are sinners, and that all, even an adulterer and a murderer, can repent and be forgiven. \n\nBut not confessing and forsaking sins is a different matter. And condemning people who speak the truth, shunning and ostracizing them and calling them leprous, etc. only makes the issues more serious, because then the healing fellowship in the light is cut off, and the life-supply hindered among the members.\n\nEventually, ALL will be known.\n\nMark 4:22 For nothing is hidden except to be made manifest; nor is anything secret except to come to light.\n\nLuke 8:17 For nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest, nor is anything secret that will not be known and come to light.\n\n1 Timothy 5:25 So also good works are conspicuous, and even those that are not cannot remain hidden.\n\nMatthew 10:26\u201333\nHave no fear... for nothing is covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known.\n\nReference: Hsu, L. M. and Dana Roberts (2013). My Unforgettable Memories: Watchman Nee and Shanghai Local Church. \n\n#watchmannee #livingstreamministry #localchurches #thelocalchurch \n\nFor those who dispute the validity/veracity of the book from which I mainly read in this video, please read: blendedbody.com/LilyHsu/DanaRoberts2013.png. Here is part:  \u0022Dr. Hsu\u0027s book is the story of Nee by those \u0027left behind.\u0027 In my research I discovered works in Chinese, even a diary by Wang Ming Dao, expressing deep disappointments with Nee\u0027s real life. Because of my prior research Dr. Hsu asked me to work on an English, privately published edition of her Memoirs (Why self-published? In the past, Nee\u0027s Local Church movement in America has used the power of law suits against publishers to suppress any disagreement.) Because of the serious allegations she made I went to Shanghai in 2006 and talked to people who knew Nee. They confirm what Dr. Hsu wrote. Thus far the reviews of the book have been written by people who know very little about the Shanghai church after 1949 (One reviewer hadn\u0027t even read the book). Nee is not the hero, but she tells us about others who served God in China. Some even died for their faith. Without her book they are known by a few friends and by God.\u0022",

      "description": "Following the pattern of our brother Martin Luther, I have some statements to make \u0022out of love for the truth and from desire to elucidate it.\u0022 These are just some of the points (probably only half of them) regarding God\u0027s Word and how it is NOT being honored in many ways by the teachings and practices and attitudes in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 - specifically among \u0022responsible one\u0022 /\u0022senior coworkers\u0022 who, even if they should disagree with a practice or teaching based on their rich knowledge of God\u0027s Word and based on their conscience, are required to tow the line lest they by labeled as dissenting, poisonous, negative, rebellious, etc. Such forced uniformity prohibits open and honest fellowship toward healing of various wounds and proper addressing of legitimate concerns.\n\nIn spite of such threats of labels and loss of life-long community, some of us must speak out if there is ever to be healing. \n\nSilence is complicity with abuse. And there is too much abuse in this group. It is just well-concealed by too many....\n \nI include some points here that are more personal, based on my specific experience, but I also try to capture at least some of the issues I have observed and experienced, and the verses/principles being violated in God\u0027s Word. I am ready to, as Martin Luther said, \u0022defend the following statements and to dispute on them\u0022 along with other victims, witnesses and experts of the statements and matters of the truth addressed herein. I do not write these things without fellowshipping over months with fellow members who share many of these convictions, and who are willing and desirous to defend the truth and to see abusive behaviors and violations of the conscience cease.\n\nPlease note: This is not a smear campaign, as I am being accused of conducting. This is not a spiteful reaction to being mistreated and abandoned by my husband. Such a crisis of experience only caused me to confront current abuse, the impotence of church leaders to help us - and the common exacerbating of the problems that their involvement precipitated, and eventually I realized that there is a pattern of covering up abuse - including the sexual assault I experienced at 16 years old, when in Taipei, at the hands of Philip Lee, of which I know leading ones were aware, yet did nothing about. To process my experiences, I searched for others\u0027 experiences in this and other high-control groups. Healing comes partly by finding fellowship and understanding with others who can relate. \n\nI am so grateful for all who have spoken out publicly, published words of truth and their personal testimonies on various platforms, and to those who have shared their experiences more privately. Knowing we are not alone helps to lessen the cognitive dissonance that can otherwise feel unbearable.\n\nThis is a defense of the truth and a speaking against abuse of believers, that the abuse would stop, that works of darkness would be exposed, and the Lord\u0027s Bride could be made ready, clothed in the righteousnesses of the saints, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing. For this I am willing to contend for the faith, along with so many who went before me - many who passed away having been shunned, smeared, lied about, and banned from gatherings in this group due to their speaking out; many who are still exposing works of darkness in love for the truth and for the church; and many who will follow.\n\n\u201CBut let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream\u0022 (Amos 5:24).\n\n#livingstreamministry #lordsrecovery #thelocalchurch #witnesslee #watchmannee #thelordsrecovery #localchurches",

I am singing all but that last one while taking a brisk walk.\n\nToday marks my 29th Anniversary. I have been apart. from my husband for all but one of the past seven anniversaries. We had healed from major marital trauma, and were joyfully back together on December 17, 2019, for our 24th anniversary, largely due to the care and support of my husband\u0027s biological dad who paid for unlimited Cheesecake Factory dates for the months leading up to our anniversary... and for that anniversary meal, too. A few days later... we were separated again, despite my disregarded pleas that our marriage would be honored. Our nuclear family has not recovered from that nightmarish recurrence of forced separation - a day Nathan called the hardest day in his life.\n\nThank you to anyone who attended our wedding or visited our home or cared for us as one unit, and who have cared for our children. No matter what the outward may seem and what the hater of marriages and the father of lies would do, the reality is that God made me and my husband one. And He gave us two precious children. I celebrate that, and continue to pray for healing.",

      "description": "Around 10 years ago... maybe close to 15 years now, an elder was dismissed quietly from eldership in Fairborn, Ohio, having drugged and molested many male college students, young adults living in at least one \u0022brothers house\u0022 in Fairborn. This was never publicly addressed. Unlike the printing of \u0022The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion\u0022 and \u0022A Response to Recent Accusations\u0022 both put out be Living Stream Ministry to publicly smear godly brothers, to untruthfully warn believers about them, no books were put out about the damages of this brother\u0027s sexual predation, nor of his financially corrupt practices - his hidden practices as a leader in this group being only one of many examples of such behavior among leaders in \u0022the local churches\u0022/\u0022the Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 and/or the Living Stream Ministry. \n\nI am posting this, being myself a victim of sexual and financial abuse in this group, and I am seeking righteousness for fellow victims. I need to know how the victims of this predator were cared for after these crimes were discovered. And I would like to know if Robbie Robinson went to jail. Were legal authorities contacted? I am putting out what I know, but I believe the consciences of believers, including mine, deserve answers, since these crimes happened against my brothers in Christ, and churches are not isolated units but are part of the universal Body. \n\nI apologize that I do accidentally directly address a couple of \u0022responsible ones\u0027 in this church community, whom I previously said I wouldn\u0027t speak to again unless they initiate contact with me toward reconciliation. When I am addressing crimes, I may inadvertently address some in \u0022responsible\u0022 positions in \u0022the\u0022 church who should scripturally confront and address sin and involve legal authorities for alleged crimes.\n\n#lordsrecovery #livingstreamministry #thelocalchurch #churchinfairborn",

(1 John 4:20)\n\nI also had the strong conviction that to keep the oneness of the church, which has been existing and developing for over 2000 years, we should put on love which is the uniting bond of perfection, and worship in spirit and truthfulness, and not subscribe to any legalities of calling ourselves \u0022THE church in ___[a city]___,\u0022 that this wasn\u0027t taught by Jesus nor by the apostles in the New Testament, and making this a legal matter actual causes division - a distinction constantly made, and a difference in care and love among believers in Christ, each of whom is part of His Body and Bride.

      "description": "I will keep pleading: \u0022Responsible Ones in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 - Please RESTORE Stephen Isitt to the fellowship in ALL the churches. He should not be banned from meetings. I make my case in this video.\n\nI feel a pain in the Body of Christ due to the ostracization, excommunication, and/or banning of my brother Stephen Isitt from \u0022the\u0022 churches in Bellevue, Seattle, and probably any other \u0022local church\u0022 affiliated with the Living Stream Ministry, based on public defamatory and condemning words spoken about him by \u0022senior co-workers\u0022 in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery.\u0022 This matters. It affects the WHOLE Body of Christ. Every member is necessary. Indispensable. My pain, \u0026 many others\u0027 pain, IS the feeling in the Body.\n\nIn my quest for what Stephen Isitt has specifically been accused of, and what he has been told he must do in order to be able to meet with \u0022the churches\u0022 - believers he loves and with whom he was built for decades, I found the requirements stated in 2 emails from an elder, Sherman Robertson (who is now with the Lord).\n\nSherman wrote in 2004: \u0022I will not be having anything more to do with you unless and until I see a complete and thorough point-by-point apology and retraction of every item in your \u201Cbook\u201D [In the Wake of the New Way] that has been posted on the Internet. And I want to see it on the Internet. Otherwise, I will be closed off to any other matter regarding you. Your statements of just \u201Cwanting to enjoy the Lord and go on\u201D mean nothing to me. That would have worked if you were just a brother who loves the Lord without any history of damage. YOU HAVE A HISTORY. Sherman\u0022\n\nSo I read through the book for which Steve Isitt is being required to apologize, which he is being told to retract publicly point by point. This \u0022book\u0022 and his sharing his concerns ARE the only \u0022history of damage\u0022, up to that point, in my awareness, for which he is being accused. \n\nIn reading through the book, again, I don\u0027t see anything to apologize for nor to retract. It is full of appreciation for Brother Lee\u0027s ministry but also full of concern for saints no longer meeting... a concern SHARED by Brother Lee: \u0022In the last few years, we have appreciated the Lord\u0027s showing us the high peak of the divine revelation. My concern is that although we may talk about the truths of the high peak, love is absent among us. If this is the case, we are puffed up, not built up. The Body builds up itself in love\u0022 and \u0022according to my observance throughout the years, most of the co workers have a human spirit of \u0022power\u0022 but not love. We need a spirit of love to conquer the degradation of today\u0027s church...this is what the recovery needs.\u0022 The Vital Groups, Witness Lee) \n\nAnd: \u0022Today, there are many brothers and sisters who need help. Hence, we have to do our best to contact them, to be concerned and care for them in love, and to strive to help and shepherd them. I hope the elders and co-workers would take this word of fellowship and exhortation to give their all and their time to contact and shepherd people. This was our shortage in the past. Now we must recover this matter.\u0022 (A Timely Trumpeting for the Present Need).\n\nThis burden, expressed by Witness Lee, is the heart of Stephen Isitt\u0027s writing \u0022In the Wake of the New Way\u0022!!\n\nSherman writes, \u0022Brother Lee was never wrong about anything that happened regarding the rebellion with John I. in the late 1980\u0027s.\u0022 But there was NO rebellion of John Ingalls in the 1980s. How/Against WHOM did John Ingalls \u0022rebel\u0022?  John Ingalls was a godly man addressing very serious sins including sexual assault of multiple sisters by the manager of the Living Stream Ministry, and John Ingalls was a church elder in Anaheim; some of the victims were in the church under his care as a shepherd. It would have been utterly negligent and complicit for an elder NOT to address these concerns with the Head of the Living Stream Ministry and the father of the perpetrator. But for doing so, he was labeled as rebellious and the sexual predation continued.\n\nRegarding many, including Sherman, claiming Witness Lee was \u0022never wrong\u0022... Witness Lee said himself (From FINAL word by Witness Lee):\n\u201CThe co-workers in different places need to learn; all responsible brothers in all localities need to learn. The eyes of the brothers and sisters all need to be opened. Too many things we need to learn. We have acted wrongly in the past, including me, I have to admit. I have had very painful repentance before the Lord. I am very sorry! I am sorry for the Body of Christ - not only for the brothers and sisters among us, but also for the ones in the denominations. You have to bring this message back and read it over and over again in mutual fellowship. Then you will see we were wrong before\u2026 To understand and analyze this needs a fair bit of effort.... We must learn from our past mistakes to receive people according to God\u0027s Son...undeviating\u2026 not deviating a bit from the path\u2026\u201D (His final message Chinese New Year Conference, Anaheim, Feb 1997)",

Those raised in this family, my children, are being adversely affected - beyond words.\n\nFor decades brothers and sisters, fellow members of the Body of Christ, have been seeking righteousness in our church community. Those raised in this community are being adversely affected - beyond words.\n\nUntil there is closure (repair and healing, or righteous dealing with clear judgement), the young ones will keep being hurt, stumbled, immeasurably.\n\nI am making yet another plea, trying to draw as simple an analogy as possible between my family situation and church situation, both rife with unrighteousness and chaos that needs to be properly addressed. God\u0027s principle is that such matters should be resolved quickly. Please don\u0027t keep delaying. \n\nMatt. 5:25, Amplified Version - Come to terms quickly [at the earliest opportunity] with your opponent at law while you are with him on the way [to court], so that your opponent does not hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you are thrown into prison.\n\nMatt. 18:6 - But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in and acknowledge and cleave to Me to stumble and sin [that is, who entices him or hinders him in right conduct or thought], it would be better (more expedient and profitable or advantageous) for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be sunk in the depth of the sea.\n\n\n#livingstreamministry  #thelocalchurch #thelocalchurches #thelordsrecovery",

There has been a teaching that there are some members above other members, and one cannot \u0022criticize\u0022 but rather must \u0022cover\u0022 those \u0022above\u0022 him/her... so leaders can do, and have done and continue to do, evil and immoral things with no accountability. \n\nBut how can we fall into such a trap? The teaching that we must not use our minds disables our God-given faculties from working to preserve us. We must love God with all our.... minds. The mature have their faculties exercised to discern. \n\nChristians should not be members of a heirarchy, but of a Body, where germs and disease, no matter where they may be in the body, are taken as serious and properly treated - not covered up out of respect for an individual member or group. \n\nTolerating and covering up gross sins is not recovery. Christ\u0027s Bride is clothed with fine linen - the righteousnesses of the saints. \n\nThis video focuses on the 1930s-50s in China, related to a truly worshipped leader of \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 - Watchman Nee.\n\n#watchmannee #thelocalchurch #localchurch #livingstreamministry #lordsrecovery #thelordsrecovery",

      "description": "Published words (by Living Stream Ministry), along with despising attitudes and multiple reports of sexual impropriety, in addition to my own personal experiences, are disgraceful related to the treatment of women (sisters) in \u0022the local churches\u0022; the sum of so many cruel words and accounts all really bothered me deeply today, and I believe all contribute toward the abuse of women (\u0022sisters\u0022) in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery.\u0022 \n\nI don\u0027t expound too much in this video - I mainly read some excerpts from \u0022the Ministry\u0022 that I find very cruel and oppressive regarding sisters, and an eyewitness account of sexual immorality in the Living Stream office in the \u002770s that was never dealt with, and which continued to victimize sisters into the late 80s, if not longer. Such treatment is clearly a pattern in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery.\u0022 Diminishing attitudes, words and treatment are pervasive in this group, and I could only confront it head-on when I was the target in my own marriage and couldn\u0027t protect my children from much impact of the abuse, with no (or with minimal, grossly inadequate) support from \u0022the local church\u0022 leaders.\n\nI understand - many sisters (I was one of them) feel honored to be sisters, to simply serve and submit. But if there is too much abuse, one begins to seek help, and when there is no help, one has to confront the issues, and when I did that, I found, and I\u0027m sure I will continue to find, reasons I have been treated so cruelly, found in the teachings and practices of those who consider themselves \u0022responsible ones\u0022 in what they teach and believe are the ONLY legitimate churches on the earth.\n\nI could say SO much more... but am trying to keep these videos brief. Thanks for caring and feel free to comment. I really appreciate the fellowship and constructive engagement on this platform.\n\n#thelocalchurch #lordsrecovery #localchurches #thelordsrecovery #livingstreamministry",

      "title": "Addressing Leaders in the Lord\u0026#39;s Recovery, Specifically at the 2024 Thanksgiving Conference",
      "description": "This video may or may not be worth your time. I am mainly holding accountable past recipients of emails I sent - almost 4 years ago - seeking help, and those recipients\u0027 fellow \u0022co-workers\u0022 in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022. The abuse I wrote about continues to this day.\n\nIn this video message, I address the responsible leaders in the Lord\u0027s Recovery ministry, emphasizing the importance of confession and recompense based on Watchman Nee\u0027s teachings, since you claim to follow HIM. \n\nI speak on behalf of many who have suffered the negligence and abuse of leaders in this group, in spite of countless pleas for help, for intervention, for change, for justice, for righteousness, for reconciliation, for oneness.... We offer proof for what you call \u0022baseless accusations,\u0022 while you blame us for lying, being people of death, being evil, though you specify no scriptural offense for which any of us can repent....\n\nI share some of my personal experiences and challenges faced over the past  recent years, mainly through reading a couple emails and texts previously sent to several of you (who are likely gathered at the Thanksgiving Conference in Atlanta this weekend). To these desperate emails I received minimal to no response from \u0022responsible ones.\u0022 Most responses from \u0022responsible ones\u0022 which I have received to these and other pleas, in my perspective, constitute further abuse. \n\nWatchman Nee writes in Messages for Building Up New Believers, published by the Living Stream Ministry (bibleread.online/all-books-by-Watchman-Nee-and-Witness-Lee/book-messages-for-building-up-new-believers-vol-2-Watchman-Nee-read-online/22/): \n\n\u0022In order to live under God\u2019s light, we need a sensitive conscience, and in order for our conscience to remain sensitive, we need to continually condemn sin as sin. We need to confess to God, and we also need to make confessions and recompenses to man....\n\n\u0022If you remember that your brother has something against you, this means you have transgressed against him. Your transgression may or may not be in material things. Perhaps you have offended him by acting unrighteously towards him. The emphasis is not on material things but on that which sets others against you. \n\n\u0022A new believer should realize that if he offends a person and does not apologize and ask for forgiveness, he is finished as soon as the offended party mentions his name and sighs before God. Whatever he offers to God will not be accepted. Whatever he prays will be turned down. We should not allow any brother or sister to sigh before God because of us. Once he or she sighs, we are finished before God. If we have done something wrong or if we have offended or hurt someone, the offended party need not accuse us before God. All he has to say before God is, \u201COh! So-and-so...\u201D or, for that matter, he just needs to utter an \u201COh\u201D and whatever we offer to God will be rejected. All he has to do is sigh a little because of us before God. We must not give any brother or sister the reason or the ground to sigh before God because of us. If we give him or her a reason to sigh, we will lose all our spiritual prospects and all our gifts to God will be annulled....\n\n \u0022If you are offering a gift at the altar and remember that your brother has anything against you or has any reason to sigh because of you, do not offer up your gift. If you want to offer to God, \u201CFirst go and be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.\u201D God wants the gift, but you must first be reconciled to others. Those who are not reconciled to men will not be able to offer a gift to God.\n\n\u0022Hopefully, the brothers and sisters will be thorough in the matter of confession and recompense. This is the way to maintain their purity. If anyone has transgressed against man, he should confess his sins to God on the one hand, and he must deal with the matter seriously with man on the other hand.\u0022\n\nViewers, especially \u0022responsible ones\u0022 in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 are encouraged to reflect on the significance of taking responsibility for your part in the damage of my marriage and family, to consider your part in the all-too-common mistreatment of others (sisters and brothers in Christ, precious enough to be redeemed by His own blood), to confess, and to offer recompense for your wrongdoings, if the Lord shines on you that you had any part in abuse and/or sins that have hurt and/or are still hurting anyone. Many of us are sighing to God about you.\n\n#lordsrecovery #localchurch #localchurches #livingstreamministry",

      "description": "To all believers in Christ who care, who want and seek the oneness of Christ\u0027s Body, and who hate abuse... specifically to my dear friends, brothers and sisters in Christ attending this week\u0027s Living Stream Ministry Thanksgiving Conference:\n\nI understand. I was just like you. I felt excited, special, blessed... any time I could participate in one of the \u0022Seven Feasts\u0022 in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 (TLR).\n\nAfter all, we had been \u0022delivered\u0022 from \u0022degraded Christianity.\u0022 We were chosen, called, and faithful. We were, without usually admitting it, an elite group, superior to other Christians. Others were so worldly. We were consecrated and most like the early churches. We were most likely to be overcomers. We were Philadelphia... I believed...\n\n...Until I realized that there wasn\u0027t actually, practically the necessary brotherly love in my desperate situation, but rather extreme partiality and heirarchy and rampant abuse and teachings that twisted the Bible to cover sin and abusers \n\n...Until I couldn\u0027t attend gatherings anymore, due to abuse that I couldn\u0027t hide and about which I was warned not to speak, but which is hurting and stumbling me and my adult children to this day... \n\n...Until I realized SO MUCH financial corruption and other sins are being covered up, and lies are being told, and my brothers and sisters are being slandered and banned from such conferences and any other \u0022church\u0022 meetings - due to their faithfully judging sins and seeking to clear up ongoing stumbling actions and inaction in TLR. \n\n...Until I couldn\u0027t subscribe to a leadership and publishing company that profits to the extent of making the \u0022minister of the age\u0022 a multimillionaire, publishing books of ministers who say they stand on the shoulders of so many believers while belittling and shaming those believers and not giving credit for, nor remaining open to, the light and life and ministry of every member of Christ\u0027s Body - even going as far as to call other ministers rebellious for not submitting to the singular Minister of the Age, the Oracle of God, the Wise Master Builder, God\u0027s Deputy Authority on the earth.....\n\n...Until I couldn\u0027t bear the use of money to abuse me, and finding a systemic disparity of wealth between the powerful leaders and other privileged and highly regarded members - while the abused whistleblowers like me are marginalized and even desperate needs are completely overlooked.\n\n...Until I realized that the haughty attitude that pervades \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery,\u0022 of somehow being better than other believers or other gatherings of believers IS sin and IS divisive.\n\nSo to all my dear friends who are attending the \u0022Thanksgiving Conference\u0022 online or in-person in Atlanta, perhaps you consider yourselves special. Maybe you consider yourselves objects of God\u0027s mercy since you consider yourselves still \u0022in the Lord\u0027s Recovery,\u0022 that you haven\u0027t \u0022left\u0022 in a \u0022rebellion.\u0022 I thought that too, for decades. Now I know what I was told were rebellions were actually events when believers\u0027 consciences forced them to confront leaders regarding untenable hypocrisy, rampant sexual misconduct, retaliatory false accusations of saints, and unbearable abuse; and that for confronting leadership regarding these sins, these faithful saints, some direct victims of crimes committed by leaders in TLR, were labeled as poisonous and rebellious, and they were quarantined - banned from any further fellowship with members in \u0022the\u0022 (\u0027genuine\u0022, \u0022on the ground of oneness\u0022) churches.\n\n#localchurch #livingstreamministry #lordsrecovery #thelocalchurch",

The tune never left my heart since then. The words came to me, hours after my husband drove away from the office where I was working, a few weeks ago, after I shook (physically) for those hours and tried to record a video of me speaking, trying to explain to viewers the effects of abuse I and others have experienced at the hand of \u0022shepherds\u0022 in my former church community. Unable to speak, I found my outlet through this song. The words are largely from Ezekiiel 34.",

      "description": "A common thread in the treatment of (former) members of \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 (TLR) is a pattern of many vague accusations, without actually rebuking these believers for actual, specific sins. Those who are being accused have definite sins that are being covered up - a practice that is contrary to keeping the oneness. Sins must be judged for the sake of the keeping of the oneness. I share 4 examples, as well as excerpts from Watchman Nee that expound on versus in 1 John, that judging sins is the basis for oneness - since our fellowship is in the light, where sin is properly dealt with. The second excerpt is from \u0022Resist the Devil\u0022 in which Watchman Nee states that Satan\u0027s accusations are not clear, and they make us feel worthless. Believers who rebuke a sinning saint do so because that saint is precious, valued, worth rebuking because we don\u0027t want to lose one another, nor to lose the fellowship, the oneness. Treating others with the silent treatment and with vague accusations does not show a valuing of fellow believers - the desire to restore, recover, and reconcile.\n\n#localchurch \n#lordsrecovery \n#thelocalchurch \n#thelordsrecovery \n#livingstreamministry \n#spiritualabuse",

There is a sickness, but believers are being shamed and ostracized by  fellow members for trying to call attention to seriously stumbling sins that are causing much collateral damage.\n\nPlease, \u201Cresponsible\u201D ones, open to fellowship until Christ\u2019s Body is flooded with life and light and healing. No believer should have to keep secrets or subscribe to a particular minister to be fully welcomed in fellowship; if this is the case, the \u201Cfellowship\u201D is sectarian - not the one fellowship of the one Body of Christ. \n\nBut I don\u2019t want to get doctrinal in these fireside chats. These are personal chats about problems that extend far beyond my personal life and situation, problems that are systemic and global\u2026 even universal - since our real struggle is not with flesh and blood on the earth.",

They also have not practiced keeping God\u2018s basic laws and refuse to communicate with me to remedy this matter and to restore fellowship and harmony, which is especially critical for the younger ones who are affected by the breach of fellowship the most, perhaps. As I sought for scriptural reconciliation with family members, extending my pleas for help to leading ones in the church, I began to realize that the entire group is based on a leadership that behaves much like my in-laws. There\u2019s a rejection of what is in God\u2019s word and shaming of people who bring up offenses, violations to God\u2018s word, and seek to deal with those offenses in the scriptural way, particularly if it contradicts what the group refers to as the ministry of the age, if it pertains to righteousness, and if it makes anyone in leadership \u201Clook bad\u201C. \n\nThis was highlighted to me yesterday by a contrast, at a bar mitzvah, in which a Jewish community exhibited an intergenerational blessing of one another and passing down of the law of God, teaching the young ones to do what is right and just and good, something our God would never abolish, something that our Lord Jesus came to fulfill, a righteous living that surpasses the scribes and Pharisees\u2019 living, which believers in Christ should be still expressing today.",

I wanted to record this video sooner but have been sick. This needs to heard and known, because THIS affects the whole Body of Christ. Bob\u2019s words and attitude represent the whole leadership of \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery.\u201D It is an attitude of defending and uplifting Witness Lee amidst unconscionable treatment of other equally precious members.\n\nRon and Kerry, you wrote that John Ingalls\u2019 very proper and scriptural sharing with the church in Anaheim affected (potentially damaged) the whole Body? It did affect us, and I am forever grateful for his constitution, ministry and living; John Ingalls shared the truth, in love. He provided us as much of the truth as God led him to share at the time.  Did Philip Lee\u2019s assaults on sisters affect the whole Body? YES.\n\nAnd as Dr. Lily Hsu writes in her book, My Unforgettable Memories, the covered up sins are one thing, and are very serious, but the continuing idolatrous worship of Nee and Lee are still a major stumbling and factor of division for many believers.\n\nEli\u2019s not dealing with his son\u2019s warranted record in the Word of God.

Don and his family had to move from the house they were renting - an \u0022LSM\u0022-owned house. His family was extensively damaged. And his story is one of so many similar stories, of lies and abuse of power destroying precious marriages and families.\n\nThere is far too much financial corruption, \u0022spiritual\u0022 coercion, dishonesty, and sexual impropriety to fit into a Youtube video, and some I, like Don Hardy and all the others, have a hard time even mentioning, it is so defiling.\n\nOne verse Brother Don left with us in these 172 pages is: \nCorinthians 11:18\u201319: \u201CI hear that there are divisions among you. And I believe it in part, for there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized.\u201D\n\nWho is genuine? Who is truthful? Who is not hiding evil secrets that have countless victims?\n\nI am one with all believers in Christ, who are one with Christ. But we are never meant to be one with sin and lies and abuse. Don says: \u0022Brother, please know that I am NOT against any ministry which came out o f WL\u0027s mouth, from GOD. I receive it (...same as I would from the pope, if he too spoke God\u0027s Words, or truth); but I will NOT be a part of WL\u0027s and now PL\u0027s SINS! Even as they do, we all need to repent of many unconfessed things.\u0022  May we all be in the Light, enjoying the Life, in Love.... Correct me if I am wrong, but THIS is being in \u0022the Stream\u0022 - the one ministry - the ministry of the Spirit, and being one with THIS ministry, we keep the oneness... of the Spirit. It was never about any certain man, other than Jesus only. \n\nI refer to this precious document in this video: truestoryofdivisionmaking.com/uploads/3/4/7/1/34712424/rosemeadtrueaccount_1.pdf\n\n#livingstreamministry \n#localchurch \n#donhardy\n#witnesslee",

This brother\u2019s writing is full of love, light, life, and factfulness. I knew many of the facts contained in his emails, but am am still shocked, sickened and heartbroken having read of so much evil covered up in what I believed to be a pure group of Christ followers. Believers deserve to know that corruption pervades the history and present leadership of \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery.\u201D We know a tree by its fruit, and when I experienced fruits of the flesh from my own husband, then from his parents, and then from elders and coworkers, I arrived at the realization that I was being presented fleshly acts, from a  whole tree that is full of sexual immorality and impurity, uncleanness, lustful pleasures, lasciviousness, idolatry, hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions, envy, drunkenness, indulgence, and the like. Not reproving men - leaders in a Christian community no less - who practice and cover such things is sin. I cannot in good conscience call \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery\u201D a group with a long history of covered up sins and lawlessness. We all make mistakes, but righteous people confess, repent, and repair relationships to restore peace with God and with fellow humans. Righteous people who may stray or fail admit the truth and turn from their wicked ways. But I am learning of so many decades of lies and corruption; I\u2019m discovering that the personal tragic undoing of my marriage and the torture I and my adult children still are trying to survive are just samplings of the evil fruit of \u201Cthis church\u2019s\u201D leadership, practices in direct opposition to God\u2019s Word.

He asked me what I would say to his daughter if she saw my videos, since he is hoping someday she will have a healthy church life. This is my short-version answer to her and to any young adult or teenager who might ask me about what I would recommend, related to the church.\n\nI would clarify or add to what I just recorded that under the point of genuineness - which should be the norm and which little children exemplify\u2026. A church should be a place where everyone can be genuine and is welcomed as they really are, not having to mask things or hide their wounds or their sicknesses. Young adults, teenagers, and anyone else should never have to pretend in order to be accepted in a church. We hear that the church is a hospital. It would not serve a patient well if they were expected to be fine, and had to act like everything is okay with them in a hospital.\n\nI welcome anyone else to share from their experiences, what you would say to a young adult seeking a healthy church life.",

      "description": "In this video I mainly read parts of the 1st section of this book, \u0022Celebrities for Jesus - How Personas, Platforms, \u0026 Profits Are Hurting the Church\u0022 by Katelyn Beaty (2022). The celebrity status of certain brothers/families has long troubled some close to me, and is, I believe, a main problem in the current (and historical) troubling situation in \u0022the church,\u0022 about which I have been speaking out. I mention in this video that Witness Lee and Philip Lee had such a dangerous and damaging celebrity status, but so do my father-in-law and my husband and many other highly regarded leading ones, in the same church community, to varying degrees, but to enough of a degree that what typical people would not get away with, they have, due to identification, \u0022love,\u0022 admiration, devotion... of many in public, while there is, behind closed doors, anger, abuse of power, cruel treatment of close family members, secrecy, giving in to temptation, and in some cases, addiction.\n\nI failed in this video to read aloud a paragraph (among many paragraphs) about Billy Graham, whom Beaty faithfully critiques regarding his celebrity status, but whose ministry was preserved due to a strict pact he made with his co-workers, the \u0022Modesto Manifesto,\u0022 to guard against common temptations. She writes (p. 38): \u0022Graham saw with prescient wisdom how intoxicating it would be for leaders to believe they are so important that they can evade accountability they need, even and perhaps especially when their work seems crucial for the kingdom. He saw that celebrity power\u0027s central lie is that an individual is important enough to be above the rules. He saw that celebrity so easily leads Christian leaders to use ministry to seek personal riches and thus defy the Bible\u0027s many warnings against greed and the love of money. He saw that celebrity causes many leaders to believe that they  can go it alone - that their individual ministries and platforms are more important and central than the  ordinary witness of local churches. And he saw that celebrity entices leaders to fudge the truth....\u0022\n\nSo applicable. Thank God for brothers who have cared, and who still care, for what went/goes on behind closed doors, even more than what is seen in public.",

Without these primary sources, trusting believers could be (and have been) more easily lied to and manipulated. We believers should not lie, nor protect lies, nor love lies  (Rev. 22:15). We love God, we love and obey His Word, we love our brothers without partiality, we abhor what is evil, and we rejoice in the truth.\n\nIn this video, I mainly read a letter written by brother Paul Kerr to K. Robichaux and R. Kangas in February 1990, just 2 months after the publication of the book \u0022A Response to Recent Accusations\u0022 - a defaming book aimed at belittling and tearing down a faithful, godly older brother\u0027s testimony to the flock under his care of why, after decades as a leading one, as a primary laborer with Witness Lee on the church hymnal and the Recovery Version of the New Testament, he needed to resign from the eldership in Anaheim. \n\nI am so thankful for all of those who spoke out and especially whose words are in print, who express the same desperate concerns I share, with a heart for the oneness of the unique Body of Christ, which \u0022Body\u0022 is NOT equivalent to those who identify as \u0022the Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022/\u0022the local churches\u0022, not restricted to adherents of Witness Lee - but comprised of all genuine believers in Christ.  \n\nThe open letter by Paul Kerr can be viewed at: www.johningalls.com/ARTRA/PaulKerrOnTheBody.pdf\n\n#johningalls\n#localchurch \n#lordsrecovery \n#thelordsrecovery \n#thelocalchurch",

I want oneness and peace, and I believe so do countless of my brothers and sisters who have reached out for fellowship about deeply offensive and wounding practices, behaviors and words too common among leaders in \u0022the Lord\u0027s Recovery.\u0022 Others desiring peace and oneness have been driven away by the cruel abuse experienced or witnessed in the church, and never spoke out publicly. I know many. And, yes, I put quotes around \u0022the Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022, because I don\u0027t believe my Lord would treat my brothers and sisters the way they have been and are being treated by many leaders in \u0022the\u0022 church, and anything abusive should never be called \u0022Recovery\u0022. So I ask you brothers, as you asked John Ingalls at the end of your book: \u0022We invite our brother[s] to treat this matter seriously and to take that proper biblical and human course of action that will produce genuine peace between [themselves] and the Body.\u0022 Many members of the Body have been and are extremely stumbled by the lack of accountability, the lack of righteousness, justice, and love toward ALL members - without partiality. Instead, there has been falsehood, gaslighting, mockery, sexual misconduct, financial corruption, defaming and despising of believers.... and I am asking that all of this get cleared up through repentance.",

Four brothers who were faithful to God\u2019s Word were publicly labeled as rebellious, and their characters were publicly smeared/assassinated, though their actual concerns about true and intolerable issues were never disclosed in this book. This video and all the videos in this series are based on the diligent work of Stephen Isitt who, for not agreeing that such false accusations be made of our brothers, and for bringing to light many important, relevant, necessary facts being covered up, has been publicly defamed, just as those brothers he has defended for over 20 years.",

I was an award -winning trainee (that\u2019s another topic\u2026). And I was the victim of multiple instances of abuse. \n\nI\u2019ve been accused of waiting until the other \u201Cparties\u201D died to speak out. I wasn\u2019t ready to speak out and lose (nearly) everything until, due to my marital crisis and the lack of effective help from responsible ones, I lost my church community and nearly everything else anyway. \n\nSome of my abusers are still alive. I wrote them emails, pleading for fellowship and reconciliation. I\u2019ve been lied about, lied to (and told when I point it out that I\u2019m on the \u201Cwrong tree\u201D), stonewalled, my personal female cycle discussed among elders and coworkers with my husband, falsely accused of various mental and emotional disorders\u2026 all because I tried to open up lines of communication, to get help, to fulfill my role as the counterpart of my husband in my home\u2026. \n\nI failed in restoring my marriage, but I was forced to look at the bigger picture, and have found that my marriage is in microcosm of a much bigger system of error.\n\nMy email is ruthewise@gmail.com. \n\nIf I spoke publicly about you in any of my videos, please know you are in good company if you are a sinner who repents. You can join all of us who can pray Psalm. 51 together and mean it.\n\nIf you are living and living lies, I hope you\u2019d be freed. \n\nIf you think that some are exempt from being accountable because of some position of authority, that\u2019s a big part of the problem. We are all accountable for our sins and for what we witness. \n\nSilence is complicity.\n\nLove rejoices with the truth.",

      "description": "This video focuses on the continuation of corrupt financial practices that began in China with Watchman Nee. Churches in Taiwan and other countries in the Far East suffered similarly, and then the corruption continued in the United States. \n\nIt is a worthy endeavor to support Christian laborers, but there should be righteous handling of finances with transparency and accountability. Financial management and decisions should not be corrupt or illegal nor covered up by teachings related to covering brothers and submitting to deputy authority. \n\nSome in \u201Cthe Lord\u2019s Recovery\u201D are excessively wealthy, while others are in dire poverty. Leading brothers typically enjoy significant salaries and comfortable lifestyles, with protection from any accountability under the teaching of \u201CGod\u2019s government.\u201D Sadly, the most wealthy in the church seem also to enjoy special treatment, in my observation. And the needy ones, who still hand everything over to the God they live and serve, are blessed if tree from the love of money, but are too often abused while being expected to submit to \u201Cauthority.\u201D \n\nAnd if Christians speak out, related to matters that provoke their conscience, or if it gets too painful and unsustainable for victims of spiritual, marital, and/or financial abuse, believers in this group may appeal to the legal process, and be driven into deep debt or bankruptcy, seeking justice. \n\n#witnesslee #lordsrecovery #thelocalchurch #localchurch #livingstreamministry #thelordsrecovery #religiousabuse #cultrecovery #loveofmoney",

Their objective letter is corroborated by all the brothers labeled as \u201Crebellious\u201D in the book The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion. \n\nThat CRI article can be viewed at lcinfo.org/?page=writings/media/turmoil.\n\nYet in 1993 and again in 1996, elders in the church in Anaheim wrote letters of apology to Phillip Lee. These 9 brothers signed a letter stating that they \u201Cdo not believe that the public declaration of those three brothers concerning Philip Lee was justified or proper.\u201D\n\nI don\u2019t know of any apology or repentance from Philip. But elders asked him for forgiveness. Did the elders feel to protect sheep being molested by Philip Lee? No one reached out to me for 30 years, though my name was mentioned by a witness as a victim. What is not proper about publicly reproving an elder after receiving reports from multiple witnesses? (1 Tim. 5:20 says,  \u201C\uFFFCAs for those who persist in sin, rebuke them\uFFFC in the presence of all, so the rest may stand in fear.\u201D) How is rebuking a serial sexual predator in a church not justifiable or proper?

      "description": "I recently read on a forum that my videos kind of all say the same thing, or something like that. Forgive me for any wordiness or repetition. \n\nWhat am I hoping for in posting these videos\u2026 so feeble and too repetitive and unimpressively simple? \n\nWhat have dozens of sincere, devout believers hoped for, who have raised awareness - or tried to- of patterns of sinning in \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery\u201D and of the covering up of those sins?\n\nI have heard a highly respected (that in itself being problematic...)\u0022senior co-worker\u0022 mocking an older brother who  confronted Brother Lee about some of the gross sins being covered up.  The \u0022senior coworker\u0022  mimicked how that elderly brother said he had to \u0022deeeaal with his conscience\u0022 (lowering his voice very deeply like that faithful brother\u0027s voice) - making a joke about such a phrase and scorning the brother. Dealing with our conscience is not something to mock. It is essential to keep the oneness and for us to properly love one another - the new commandment, by  which all men know that we are Jesus\u0027 disciples.\n\nI hope these videos and my blog (inconvenientruth.com) would join with the voices of many other dear and faithful believers who have not been able to remain silent about intolerable and unreal with sins. Many voices were silenced. Many who\u2019ve spoken out have been publicly shamed and lied about. Such ones face spiritual abuse. Many have lost precious friends and family members due to misrepresentation. \n\nBut silence is not an option once one\u2019s conscience is provoked, when the Lord in us is turning over tables in what should be house of prayer, but has become a den of thieves (Matt. 21:13; Mark 11:17; Luke 19:46). \n\nThe goal of every single video and every single blog I post is \u201Clove, which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith\u201D (1 Tim. 1:5). \n\nTo have healthy love for one another, we need a pure heart and a good conscience and sincere faith. I learned as a little child how to take care of my conscience and it\u2019s something that no believer should ever graduate from. \n\nI pray that any involved would humble ourselves and pray and seek God\u2019s face and turn from our wicked ways, that God would hear and forgive and heal our land (2 Chron. 7:14).\n\n#localchurch \n#witnesslee \n#lordsrecovery \n#spiritualabuse\n#denofrobbers",

The book is My Unforgettable Memories- Watchman Nee\u0026 Shanghai Local Church. The author was a young sister in the church with Watchman Nee. She did extensive research to verify her accounts, which include many eyewitness accounts and letters. There are many witnesses of gross sins committed by Watchman Nee throughout decades in China. The only reason anyone would refuse to believe this to be at least possible, refuse to hear multiple witnesses and refuse to address a long history of damaging practices, including a person being called a \u201Ddelegate [or deputy] authority\u201D being unquestionable and unaccountable, is that we have made some leaders idols - not humans like the rest of us including King David who are not above sinning - and not above being rebuked and openly repenting. \n\nDon\u2019t excommunicate me for speaking my concerns. I am deeply concerned partly because I am a direct victim of sexual immorality practiced and covered up in the Lords recovery, that has yet to be addressed by anyone in leadership, although several knew about it over 35 years ago. And I am aware of many more cases. And we should repent for idolizing anyone\u2026 even a \u201CMinister of the Age.\u201D",

In my youth this didn\u2019t sound right. It sounded controlling, diminishing and limiting of all the members of the church, each with their precious portions and experiences and light from God\u2019s Word. \n\nOne may reason such things away, justifying them by various verses like Paul saying to the Philippians that we should all speak the same thing. But he didn\u2019t charge them to say only what he said. I\u2019ve heard the exposition that Paul means we should all speak Christ - the multifaceted, unsearchable, measureless riches of Christ and goodness of God\u2026 and we need eternity for that. NOT as tape recorders but as those with a personal knowing and seeing of Christ and all the riches in God\u2019s Word.\n\nTo have an attitude that we can only speak with another person, a leader, has spoken can very easily become culty - controlling, and totalitarian, etc.\n\nI am off to meet with believers, but thought I would post this for fellowship among anyone who wants to participate.

      "description": "Without partiality and favoritism I feel to keep speaking out about multiple cases in which responsible ones in the Local Church and in \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery\u201D did not deal properly with sins. These are not victimless sins. They damage the hearts and families of targets and victims. The damage can extend even for generations. The damage doesn\u2019t disappear or heal with silence, but through applying God\u2019s Word faithfully, which involves rebuking and reproving, in the case of leading ones, publicly, and they\u2019re being repentance and forgiveness.\n\nThe practice in the Lords recovery has been to publicly rebuke people who speak out, and to quarantine them and label them as poisonous and negative. I am not poisonous or negative. I can\u2019t tolerate these patterns in what is being called \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery.\u201D Lives are being destroyed. \n\nBrothers, what is the motive of stank silent about these improprieties and sins? Is it because of partiality towards certain families? Is it because of financial gain that may be affected if people hold you accountable? \n\nWe live before the Lord. It is better to deal with offenses and sins in this age, while we are still on our way home to meet the Lord.\n\nI\u2019d like to add, related the sexual abuse my daughter experienced from a son of Ben Phillips, Jr.:\n\n1) Brother Ben, when you made that appeal at your dad\u2019s memorial for those who have \u201Cleft\u201D to \u201Ccome back\u201D - brother, if we left a particular gathering of believers because we weren\u2019t safe, we weren\u2019t protected by leaders, and we were ignored and/or shamed if we spoke out, how/why would we return to that environment? And I refuse to call such an environment \u201Cthe\u201D church\u2026. Yes, the church in Corinth had problems, but hopefully they were dealt with properly and thoroughly by leaders. Eventually their testimony faded. Eventually the lampstand was removed from the church in Ephesus. You can have the right name but not be the reality of a church as a lampstand. \n\n2) I am not speaking about this matter to shame any minors in the church. They need care and shepherding and protection and guidance from the older ones. Both my daughter and this other young person, were suffering, deep depression and family-related pain. They found a lot of solace in being together and talking honestly together. But personal boundaries should always be honored. When my daughter asked for help, help could\u2019ve been given, but her appeals were ignored.\n\n3) To Christy\u2019s grandparents, Willie and Rosalind Wise, she opened to you about her being molested. You told her to not say anything about it, but to cover the family. You should have protected your granddaughter (or any other victim opening to you) - not the image of a high profile family. We should protect every victim of sexual violence, assault, and harassment, without partiality or favoritism.\n\nTo all, this is a PATTERN in \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery\u201D and it is not sustainable. There needs to be proper rebuking and repenting and forgiveness and restoration in cases such as those I mention in this video. \n\n#thelocalchurch \n#lordsrecovery",

      "description": "In this video, I speak out about a member of my spiritual family, who has not been shepherded properly to repent and to be restored to the fellowship, but rather his sins that have stumbled many, and his disappearance that grieves even more of us, are all covered up and \u0022not spoken about\u0022 (except in small circles). This is contrary to GOD\u0027S Word, which says, \u0022Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses. But those elders who are sinning you are to reprove before everyone, so that the others may take warning.  I charge you, in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, to keep these instructions without partiality, and to do nothing out of favoritism\u0022 (I Tim. 5:19-21).\n\nI am just a \u0022little\u0022 (53-year-old) sister but I can\u0027t bear the lack of practicing what is in God\u0027s Word, in the name of \u0022covering brothers,\u0022 in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery.\u0022 What about protecting endangered wives? What about comforting heart-broken children and grandchildren? What about loving one another enough to reprove publicly, for there to be public warning and public repentance and full forgiveness and restoration?\n\nThere should be no favoritism, no partiality. If you rebuke brothers publicly who are maintaining a clean conscience, speaking truthfully, but whose speaking may tarnish the reputation of an individual or an organization, but you are covering up gross sins of leading brothers, trying to hide the truth, that is partiality.\n\nAs long as I am alive, I won\u0027t stand by, but I will speak up and speak out the truth... the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God. We are ALL affected by lies in our communities and especially in the church (composed of ALL believers), including lies of ommission, and by the loss of the function of fellow members who fall into sin or are excommunicated for speaking up about sins that need to be dealt with scripturally.\n\nTo the brother I address, and to his family, I hope you receive my words in this public way only from my heart of love and my deep desire for restoration and for preservation of the Lord\u0027s testimony and genuine oneness, apart from sin, among ALL His believers, wherever and with whomever we may be practically meeting.\n\nLove finds no joy in unrighteousness but rejoices in the truth (1 Cor. 13:6).\n\n#lordsrecovery \n#thelocalchurch \n#witnesslee \n#cultrecovery",

When the fruit of a particular tree is growing, the fruit itself will show what it is. When the fruit becomes ripe, it will fall from the tree. At this point, however, I do not feel that I should tolerate certain situations any longer, because enough damage has been done already. I do not like to see more damage done to the Lord\u2019s recovery. I have no time, dear saints, to fool around with people any longer. Let us go to fight the battle. Who are the \u201Cus\u201D? They are the ones who are desperate with no opinion.\n\nand...\n\u0022It is altogether not wise for you to remain in the recovery taking this ministry on the one hand and yet on the other hand to say something else. This is not wise. It is not profitable to yourself or to your future. You may say that you have a ministry, but this is not profitable to your ministry if you have one. You can never profit your ministry in the future in this way. Rather, you have dispensed your future in a cheap way. The wise way is to stay, without any opinion, with the recovery, which is unique.\u0022]\n\nIf there is abuse in THE church and/or in the Ministry office of the publication company, to remain \u0022faithful\u0022 in the church and \u0022faithful to the ministry\u0022  - or \u0022one with the ministry\u0022  - seems to require that you look the other way rather than confront and deal with stumbling sin. Such \u0022oneness\u0022 of \u0022the Body\u0022 is actually a loyalism to a corrupt system/organization with a financial conflict of interest. \n\nI don\u0027t do justice in this video (nor in any video)... but hopefully this is a start.\n\nAdd to this the fact that much money is brought in by the activities of the Living Stream Ministry that supports many \u0022faithful to the ministry.\u0022 What if such ones were to say, \u0022Sin is not acceptable. Sexual harrassment is illegal and should be dealt with seriously.\u0022 Would they lose their financial support? Would they be shunned?\n\nOh, wait, this happened. And such ones were labeled \u0022rebellious\u0022 and \u0022poisonous\u0022 and lied about and excommunicated (\u0022quarantined\u0022).\n\nWe were cheated from their ministry - which I believe each and every member of Christ\u0027s body has.\n\nOur oneness must not depend on oneness with anyone other than the Triune God. If it is, we are very likely in a cult.\n\n#witnesslee \n#lordsrecovery \n#thelocalchurch \n#cultrecovery",

      "description": "Dear viewers of this or any of my videos - Whether or not you are actually in a cult, sharing characteristics with cults should be concerning and should cause anyone to consider their ways. Very trained therapists I have had have said that minimally, I have been treated in cult-like ways over the years... and I know this to be true. I watched \u0022Scientology and Its Aftermath\u0022 with tears streaming down my face during some episodes, being able to identify with victims speaking out, or of whom others were speaking. As believers and as doers of God\u0027s Word, cult-like behaviors should not be characteristic of our practices.\n\nIn this video, I mainly read from a webpage of an international authority on cults, Janja Lalich (janjalalich.com/help/characteristics-associated-with-cults/).\n\nI also make a few feeble comments with a few examples of experiences, practices and observations that align to these characteristics, practiced in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022/\u0022The Local Churches\u0022. If I said more, and I have a lot more to say, the video would get too long.\n\nFor many, including myself for many years, it is hard to hear these words until/unless you reach a point in your life where destructive treatment directed at you or at someone you love is no longer bearable... then in order to heal, you begin to face the facts and to think soberly and, yes, critically, about your community, your choices (or lack thereof), the consequences of your choices, and how all of that compares to the characteristics of cults.",

Perhaps they  are 100% open to understanding if in any way they have misunderstood anything or anyone.
