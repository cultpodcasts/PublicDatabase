      "description": "From Cult Conditioning To Child Protection: Kim Kelley\u2019s Survivor-Led Blueprint | Ep 389\n\n\nWhat if the most reliable alarm for control is this: truth doesn\u2019t mind being questioned? That line unlocks the heart of our conversation with Kim Kelley, a nationally recognized child safety advocate and survivor who translates lived experience into practical systems that protect kids in the real world and the digital one.\n\nWe start by separating adult influence from child conditioning. Adults can choose to leave; children can\u2019t. Kim maps how coercive groups rewire reality\u2014teaching \u201Cred is blue,\u201D punishing questions, and rewarding loyalty\u2014then shares her ten rules of every cult so you can spot the playbook anywhere it appears: in religious communities, closed online networks, or glossy \u201Cgood works\u201D fronts. The goal isn\u2019t cynicism; it\u2019s clarity that fuels action.\n\nFrom there, we move into what actually helps: safe landing zones before therapy, survivor\u2011informed aftercare that avoids re\u2011traumatizing requirements, and patient deprogramming grounded in validation. Kim\u2019s reframing is powerful: a coward harmed a child; the survivor is the badass who lived and chose to heal. We scrutinize the pressure to \u201Cforgive and forget,\u201D the pitfalls of box\u2011checking nonprofits, and how performative activism drains resources without changing outcomes. Instead, Kim outlines concrete steps\u2014law enforcement training, tech safeguards for families, smarter community operations\u2014that turn outrage into prevention.\n\nIf you care about child protection, online safety, and trauma\u2011informed support, this conversation gives you tools, language, and resolve. Take one tangible step today\u2014audit a device, set a family agreement, share the checklist with a friend, or connect your local agency to survivor\u2011led training. Subscribe, rate, and share to help more people trade awareness for action.\n\n\nChapter Markers\n\n\n0:00 Welcome Back And Context\n\n\n6:40 Defining Brainwashing For Adults vs Kids\n\n\n18:20 Ten Rules Of Every Cult\n\n\n31:30 How Survivors Escape And Deprogram\n\n\n43:10 Patience, Truth, And Red Flags\n\n\n52:30 Systems, Safe Houses, And Bias\n\n\n#KimKelley #ChildTrafficking #TraumaToMission #EndChildTrafficking #SurvivorStories #ActivismAgainstTrafficking #ExposeTrafficking #HumanRightsAdvocate #BreakTheSilence #EmpowerSurvivors #DisruptTraffickingNetworks #SocialJusticeWarrior #HealingFromTrauma #ProtectChildrenNow #CrisisAwareness #justiceforsurvivors #VoicesforVoices #VoicesforVoicesPodcast #JustinAlanHayes #JustinHayes #help3billion #TikTok #Instagram #truth #Jesusaire #VoiceForChange #HealingTogether #VoicesForVoices389\n\n\nSupport the show (https://cash.app/$VoicesforVoices)",

      "description": "David Solomon returns to share his harrowing first-hand experience with the Followers of Christ Church in Oregon City, known as \u0022The Baby Killing Cult\u0022 for its dangerous faith healing practices and manipulation tactics. He provides crucial insights into cult recruitment strategies, brainwashing techniques, and institutional complicity to help others recognize warning signs and find hope after escaping similar situations.\n\n\u2022 Youth recruitment tactics that separate children from parents through fun activities and special attention\n\u2022 Gradual indoctrination process that creates dependency on the cult while isolating members from family\n\u2022 Dangerous faith healing doctrine that rejects medical care, resulting in preventable deaths and suffering\n\u2022 Manipulation of Bible verses to control members through fear and twisted theology\n\u2022 Institutional connections with police, social services and schools that protect the cult from accountability\n\u2022 Brainwashing techniques that turn children against parents by claiming parents are \u0022spiritually unwell\u0022\n\u2022 Warning signs that someone you know might be involved in a destructive cult\n\u2022 Message of hope that escape is possible and survivors are not alone\n\nIf you or someone you know has been affected by cult manipulation, please reach out for help.
