      "description": "BBC Panorama Journalist John Sweeney on the urgent need for reform of Britain\u0027s libel laws.  Major publishers in the UK turned down John\u0027s book \u0027The Church of Fear: Inside the Weird World of Scientology\u0027. British publisher Transworld has cancelled publication of Pulitzer Prize-winner Lawrence Wright\u0027s book \u0027Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood and the Prison of Belief\u0027, following legal advice.  \n\nIn the video, John refers to what former members of the Church of Scientology have said about the religion.  More information on his comments can be found in his book \u0027The Church of Fear: Inside the Weird World of Scientology\u0027 (published by Silvertail Books), and also in a 1984 High Court judgement http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/audit/latey.html",
