      "title": "Cecilia Steyn: The Krugersdorp Cult Killings",
      "description": "This is the chilling true story of Electus per Deus\u2014Latin for Chosen by God\u2014a South African murder cult led by a woman who claimed to fight demons but instead manipulated her followers into committing a string of cold-blooded murders. From 2012 to 2016, Krugersdorp became the backdrop to one of the country\u2019s most disturbing crime sprees. The group lured victims with fake job ads, staged ritualistic killings, and eliminated anyone who stood in their way. At the center of it all was Cecilia Steyn, a self-declared prophet who never killed with her own hands, but whose influence turned everyday people into loyal executioners. What started as a twisted belief system spiraled into a calculated operation of death, driven by revenge, greed, and blind faith. This case shocked the nation\u2014not just for the brutality of the murders, but because the killers looked like your neighbors, teachers, and friends.\n#truecrimestories #southafricancrime #courtroom",
