Wide of reporters speaking to lawmakers outside the U.S. Capitol with dome in background\r\n2. SOUNDBITE (English) Rep. Thomas Massie, (R) Kentucky:\r\nReporter: \u0022What are you hoping to hear or see from the DOJ (Department of Justice) moving forward when it relates to the Epstein files?\r\nMassie: \u0022That\u0027s a great question. You know, they\u0027ve said, oh, we\u0027ve got a million documents which could be 4 million pages. What we want very specifically are just a few hundred pages. And these are the 302 forms that the FBI fills out when they interview the victims and they interview witnesses. We also want draft indictments where they were going to indict a lot of people or bring a lot more counts against Jeffrey Epstein, and then decided not to. They need to release those to us. Right now, they\u0027re claiming cover from these FOIA standards that say that you don\u0027t have to release internal deliberate ones when somebody does a Freedom of Information Act. The problem is, our bill specifically anticipated that and said they have to release internal communications having to do with decisions about whether to prosecute or not prosecute. So we think they\u0027re clearly in violation of the law. And that\u0027s one of the big reasons we want the judge to appoint a special master to kind of oversee what\u0027s going on here with these redactions. It\u0027s not the volume of material they\u0027re giving us. It\u0027s the material they\u0027re not giving us that we\u0027re concerned about.\u0022\r\n3. Pan of reporters speaking with Rep.

And Pam Bondi, and Todd Blanch have been, talking to this judge about the redactions. And so we thought it was appropriate to ask Judge (Paul) Engelmayer to appoint the special master.\u0022\r\nReporter: \u0022Why do you think you\u0027re still getting attacked by President Trump on social media?\u0022\r\nMassie: \u0022I think he\u0027s attacking me to keep the rest of these guys in line. He mentioned me several times in the retreat, even though I wasn\u0027t there. And I think he\u0027s just trying to drive home to them that, hey, if you don\u0027t stay in line, I\u0027ll give you the Massie treatment.\u0022\r\nReporter: \u0022Do you think that is why they didn\u0027t vote to override his (Trump\u0027s) veto?\u0022\r\nMassie: \u0022Yeah, I do think there was some bully pulpit intimidation going on there.\u0022\r\n5.

It is horrifying. My thoughts are with the victims, but what I am encouraged by is the House Oversight Committees continued pursuit of their subpoenas against Les Wexner and others.

Various Las Vegas police work near the home of former actor Nathan Lee Chasing His Horse, who goes by Nathan Chasing Horse\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nNathan Chasing Horse, the former \u201CDances with Wolves\u201D actor accused of sexual abuse, was temporarily thrown out of court Monday after he disrupted proceedings with demands he be allowed to fire his defense attorney a week before trial.\r\n\r\nJudge Jessica Peterson in Las Vegas ordered his jury trial to proceed next week as planned.\r\n\r\nChasing Horse has pleaded not guilty to 21 charges, including allegations that he sexually assaulted women and girls and that he filmed himself sexually abusing a girl younger than 14. Prosecutors allege he used his reputation as a spiritual leader and healer to take advantage of Native American women and girls over two decades.\r\n\r\nPeterson ordered him removed from court Monday for trying to speak over her. He argued that his attorney, Craig Mueller, did not come to visit him and did not file timely. He asked that a public defender who previously represented him be his attorney.\r\n\r\nMueller, a private defense attorney, told the court his client was ready and privately told the judge that one of his investigators had visited with Chasing Horse. He declined to comment to The Associated Press.\r\n\r\nBest known for portraying the character Smiles A Lot in the 1990 movie \u201CDances with Wolves,\u201D Chasing Horse was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, which is home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.\r\n\r\nAfter starring in the Oscar-winning film, according to prosecutors, Chasing Horse began propping himself up as a self-proclaimed Lakota medicine man while traveling around North America to perform healing ceremonies. When he was arrested in 2023, he was living in a North Las Vegas house with his five wives, according to prosecutors.\r\n\r\nThe case sent shock waves across Indian Country. The original indictment was dismissed in 2024 after the Nevada Supreme Court ruled prosecutors abused the grand jury process when they provided a definition of grooming as evidence without any expert testimony. However, the court left open the possibility of charges being refiled, and a new indictment was brought later that year.\r\n\r\nProsecutors claim Chasing Horse led a cult called The Circle, and his followers believed he could speak with spirits. His victims went to him for medical help, according to a transcript from a grand jury hearing.\r\n\r\nProsecutors expect the trial to last three weeks. It is scheduled to begin Monday.\r\n\r\n===========================================================\r\n\r\nClients are reminded to adhere to all listed restrictions and to check the terms of their licence agreements.

We were groomed. We were manipulated. And we were taken advantage of. For decades, survivors have been suffocated by speculation. We\u0027ve been mocked. We\u0027ve been doubted. We\u0027ve been re-traumatized.  while those that hide and seek are what those responsible hide in secrecy. Why don\u0027t we deserve justice? This is not partisan. However, this is very political, as the only path to justice is through our political system. And this is about justice. This is about accountability. This is about protecting the innocence of our children and honoring the dignity of survivors. Everywhere we turn, the story follows us. It\u0027s in headlines, jokes, music, grocery store checkout lines, random conversations that you hear people having in restaurants. For more than 20 years, we\u0027ve been unable to escape it. And every time new promises are made,  our sparks of hope are lit only to be extinguished again. We are tired. However, we are not going away. We will not stop or give up. And we will be on the front lines of this battle. We are no longer scared. And let\u0027s be clear. There were so many enabling adults.

And for our government and for the politicians who have taken our trauma and have weaponized it against us making it unbearable, making it unlivable, making it hard to move on in a life that we wish to live, in happiness, in joy and peace and justice that can only come from within at this point. And we have gotten to this point. Shame on you. Shame on you for using our trauma to weaponize this moment. We are not going to be fooled by your trickery. We are not going to be fooled by the lies, by the conspiracy theories. We are the keys to this situation. We have the truth. And the FBI knows the truth. The government knows the truth.

      "description": "(24 Jul 2018) An heiress to the Seagram fortune has been released on 100 million US dollars bond after pleading not guilty to racketeering charges related to a New York self-help group accused of branding women and forcing them into unwanted sex.\r\nClare Bronfman left a Brooklyn federal court without speaking to reporters on Tuesday.\r\nThe 39-year-old daughter of the late billionaire philanthropist and former Seagram chairman Edgar Bronfman Senior had been arrested with three other people earlier in the day.\r\nBronfman was accused in an indictment of taking a number of steps to help Keith Raniere, founder and leader of NXIVM (NEHK\u0027-see-uhm), exercise control over group members, including identity theft, intercepting electronic communications and money laundering.\r\nRaniere was arrested in Mexico this year and brought to the US to face charges that he, along with an adherent, TV actress Allison Mack, coerced followers into becoming \u0022slaves\u0022 to senior members.\r\nIn an indictment, prosecutors say Mack helped Raniere recruit women to a secret sub-society within NXIVM whose members were branded by way of a surgical tool with a symbol that resembled his initials. \r\nWomen were also expected to be subservient to \u0022masters\u0022, prosecutors said, including giving in to demands for sex.\r\nThe arrest of Bronfman, who has long been affiliated with NXIVM, wasn\u0027t a surprise. \r\nAt a court hearing in June, a judge rejected an attempt to get Raniere released on 10 million dollars bail paid for by Bronfman after prosecutors labeled her a co-conspirator.\r\nIn earlier court filings, the government detailed how Bronfman gave away tens of millions of dollars of her fortune to support Raniere and his group, including paying for private air travel at a cost of 65,000 dollars a flight. \r\nIn a website post last year, Bronfman called the secret society a \u0022sorority\u0022 that had \u0022truly benefited the lives of its members, and does so freely\u0022. \r\nShe added, \u0022I find no fault in a group of women (or men for that matter) freely taking a vow of loyalty and friendship with one another to feel safe while pushing back against the fears that have stifled their personal and professional growth.\u0022\r\nRaniere and Mack have also denied the allegations. \r\nIn their court papers, defence lawyers said the alleged victims of the group were never abused, and were in fact \u0022independent, smart, curious adults\u0022 searching for \u0022happiness, fulfillment and meaning\u0022.\r\nDespite criticism for years by ex-followers who called NXIVM a cult and a pyramid scheme, the organisation\u0027s intense self-improvement classes had, at one point, earned it thousands of adherents, including some with Hollywood ties. \r\nThey included Nicki Clyne, an actress who appeared on \u0022Battlestar Galactica\u0022, Bronfman\u0027s sister Sara, a son of former Mexican president Carlos Salinas de Gortari and India Oxenberg, a daughter of \u0022Dynasty\u0022 actress Catherine Oxenberg.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/871582a0c890e316c70437e20acc6c09",

SOUNDBITE (English) Marc Agnifilo, Attorney for Keith Raniere:\r\nReporter question: \u0022Now you said it was consensual. Was your client a member of a sex slave cult as they say?\u0022\r\nAgnifilo: \u0022No absolutely not. I mean it\u0027s a slogan, it\u0027s a label that the government is attaching to conduct to make it nefarious. I think what you\u0027re going to see is that this DOS is something that people joined, women joined of their own volition, for their own reasons, and as part of what they felt they wanted to sort of accomplish in life. I don\u0027t think you\u0027re going to find any credible evidence that anybody was brought into this group against their will, that anybody was kept in this group against their will. I think what you\u0027re going to see is that a lot of adult, strong-minded, free-willed women made decisions for their own lives and made their own choices and that\u0027s what the evidence is going to show soundly. I\u0027m absolutely confident that that\u0027s what everyone will see when the dust settles.\u0022\r\n3. Allison Mack walking into court \r\n4. SOUNDBITE (English) Marc Agnifilo, Attorney for Keith Raniere:\r\n\u0022There are well-known groups of men that brand themselves. It\u0027s utterly uncontroversial. But a group of women decide the brand themselves and then all of a sudden we assume that they\u0027re victims. I think quite frankly, as you know someone who is in a profession where there\u0027s lots of strong women, I\u0027ve had the privilege of meeting lots of strong women, I think this is something that women very much can do on their own as a matter of their own free choice and it\u0027s no more controversial than if a group of men did it. This was their choice. They did it of their own volition and that\u0027s going to be soundly proven and it\u0027s a choice that they\u0027re free to make.\u0022 \r\n5. Allison Mack exiting court with her attorneys \r\n6. Allison Mack walking among reporters \r\n7. SOUNDBITE (English) Marc Agnifilo, Attorney for Keith Raniere:\r\n\u0022We are very happy with what happened in court today. Judge (Nicholas) Garaufis is showing that he is going to give us the prompt trial that we were asking for. We wanted it a little earlier than October first but we are very happy with October first. We are absolutely confident the matter will resolve with a trial. I do not see Mr. Raniere pleading guilty. He has no reason to plead guilty. He steadfastly denies these charges and I expect that we are going to have a very vigorous defense and I predict that we will prevail after a trial in this case.\u0022\u00A0\u00A0\r\n8. Allison Mack walks down sidewalk \r\nSTORYLINE: \r\n\u0027SMALLVILLE\u0027 ACTRESS IN COURT FOR SEX CULT CASE\r\nSmallville actress Allison Mack appeared in federal court Friday (4 MAY 2018) along with Keith Raniere, the leader of the group NXIVM. Both are charged with coercing women who joined the organization into becoming sex slaves. \r\nSome of the women were branded with a symbol that prosecutors said contained Raniere\u0027s initials.\r\nMack and Raniere have pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking. They have denied wrongdoing.\r\nThe court appearance Friday is one of several the pair will have before trial.\r\nRaniere has been held without bail. Mack was freed after a court appearance last month.\r\nArrangements are being made for her to be on house arrest in California.\r\nInside Friday\u0027s court hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Moira Penza told a judge that the government plans to file a new indictment naming more defendants, but he didn\u0027t go into specifics.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/5d5fe9f6a62bb6184628412e1357c359",

Various Las Vegas police work near the home of former actor Nathan Lee Chasing His Horse, who goes by Nathan Chasing Horse\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nThe sex abuse trial of former \u201CDances with Wolves\u201D actor Nathan Chasing Horse in Nevada has again been postponed.\r\n\r\nA judge on Monday moved the start of the trial in state court in Las Vegas to Aug. 4. The 48-year-old had been scheduled to stand trial next week on charges that he sexually abused Indigenous women and girls for years in the Las Vegas area.\r\n\r\nCraig Mueller, Chasing Horse\u0027s lawyer, said in a motion filed Friday that he needs more time to prepare and interview witnesses. It\u0027s the latest in a series of delays since Chasing Horse was arrested and indicted in early 2023.\r\n\r\nChasing Horse has pleaded not guilty to 21 felonies, including sexual assault of a minor under 16, kidnapping and producing and possessing videos of child sexual abuse. If convicted of the sexual assault charges, he could face decades or life in prison.\r\n\r\nAfter starring as Smiles A Lot in the 1990 Oscar-winning film \u201CDances with Wolves,\u201D Chasing Horse began promoting himself as a self-proclaimed Lakota medicine man while traveling around North America to perform healing ceremonies, authorities have said. He was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.\r\n\r\nProsecutors say Chasing Horse used his position to gain access to vulnerable women and girls for decades until his arrest near Las Vegas. He has been jailed ever since, but criminal proceedings were at a standstill for more than a year while Chasing Horse challenged his original indictment.\r\n\r\nIt was eventually dismissed after the Nevada Supreme Court ruled that prosecutors had abused the grand jury process when they provided a definition of grooming as evidence without any expert testimony. The high court\u0027s order, however, left open the possibility for charges to be refiled, and prosecutors quickly took their case before another grand jury.\r\n\r\nChasing Horse was again indicted in October. The indictment added new allegations that he filmed himself having sex with one of his accusers when she was younger than 14. Prosecutors have said the footage, taken in 2010 or 2011, was found on cellphones in a locked safe inside the North Las Vegas home that Chasing Horse is said to have shared with five wives, including the girl in the videos.\r\n\r\nHis case has been unfolding at the same time lawmakers and prosecutors around the U.S. are funneling more resources into cases involving Native women, including human trafficking and killings.\r\n\r\n===========================================================\r\n\r\nClients are reminded to adhere to all listed restrictions and to check the terms of their licence agreements.

The court sided with Chasing Horse, saying in its scathing order that prosecutors had abused the grand jury process. But the court left open the possibility for charges to be refiled.\r\n\r\nClark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson quickly vowed to seek another indictment. Neither Wolfson nor a spokesperson for his office immediately responded Thursday to phone or emailed requests for comment.\r\n\r\nBest known for portraying the character Smiles A Lot in the 1990 movie \u201CDances with Wolves,\u201D Chasing Horse was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, which is home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.\r\n\r\nAfter starring in the Oscar-winning film, according to prosecutors, Chasing Horse began propping himself up as a self-proclaimed Lakota medicine man while traveling around North America to perform healing ceremonies.\r\n\r\nProsecutors said his position in the community granted him access to vulnerable women and girls for decades until his arrest last January near Las Vegas. He has been jailed ever since.\r\n\r\nChasing Horse\u0027s arrest reverberated around Indian Country. Law enforcement in the U.S. and Canada quickly followed up with more criminal charges, saying that his arrest helped corroborate long-standing allegations against him, including on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Montana where tribal leaders had banished Chasing Horse in 2015 amid allegations of human trafficking.\r\n\r\nAuthorities in Alberta, Canada, have acknowledged that their case is largely symbolic. Chasing Horse \u2014 who faces decades in a Nevada prison if convicted \u2014 might not ever return to Canada.\r\n\r\n\u201CAt the end of the day,\u201D Sgt. Nancy Farmer of the Tsuut\u2019ina Nation Police Service has said, \u201Cit is important for us to have these warrants in the system so our victims know they\u2019ve been heard. It\u2019s extremely important that we continue to support them that way.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn Las Vegas, Chasing Horse had pleaded not guilty to the original charges. His new lawyer didn\u0027t immediately respond to an email seeking comment, and his former public defender, Kristy Holston, said she had no comment on the new indictment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/1b6996d85cb14e0bac5a132facb9ecf6",

That is my daughter, the brother to the husband, her mother-in-law and two of her children. But we\u2019ve been told that one of the children did not match the DNA, so now we\u2019ve been given only four (bodies).

Justice Douglas Herndon dissented. Chasing Horse still can seek a hearing before the full seven-member court.\r\n\r\nThe state high court decision means prosecutors in Las Vegas can proceed with their 18-count criminal case after months of Chasing Horse legal challenges. The 47-year-old has been in custody since his arrest in January 2023 near the North Las Vegas home he is said to have shared with five wives.\r\n\r\nChasing Horse has pleaded not guilty to charges including sexual assault of a minor, kidnapping and child abuse. A hearing is scheduled next Wednesday in Clark County District Court.\r\n\r\nHis lawyers argued the case should be dismissed because, the former actor said, the sexual encounters were consensual. One of his accusers was younger than 16, the age of consent in Nevada, when the alleged abuse began, authorities said.\r\n\r\nKristy Holston, a deputy public defender representing Chasing Horse, also argued the indictment was an overreach by the Clark County district attorney\u2019s office and that some evidence presented to the grand jury, including a definition of grooming, had tainted the state\u2019s case.\r\n\r\nHolston declined Thursday to comment about the state Supreme Court decision.\r\n\r\nChasing Horse is known for his portrayal of Smiles a Lot in the 1990 film \u201CDances with Wolves.\u201D\r\n\r\nLaw enforcement authorities say in the decades since starring in the Oscar-winning movie, Chasing Horse became a self-proclaimed medicine man among tribes and traveled around North America to perform healing ceremonies. They say he used his position to gain access to vulnerable girls and women starting in the early 2000s.\r\n\r\nThe abuse allegations cross multiple U.S. states, including Nevada, where he was living when he was arrested, as well as Montana and South Dakota, according to the indictment.\r\n\r\nOne of the victims identified in the Nevada case was 14 when Chasing Horse told her the spirits of their ancestors had instructed him to have sex with her, according to court documents and prosecutors.\r\n\r\n===========================================================\r\n\r\nClients are reminded to adhere to all listed restrictions and to check the terms of their licence agreements.

Nathan Chasing Horse standing in court\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nCanadian police have issued warrants for a former \u201CDances With Wolves\u201D actor who is facing nine charges including sexual exploitation, sexual assault and removing a child from Canada under the age of 16.\r\n\r\nTsuut\u2019ina Nation Police Service said Tuesday in a statement that the investigation has spanned several years with one of the alleged offences dating back to 2005.\r\n\r\nThe actor has been in jail in Las Vegas since his arrest in January in southern Nevada, where he is charged with 18 felonies, including sexual assault of a minor, child abuse and kidnapping.\r\n\r\nChasing Horse played the role of Sioux tribe member Smiles a Lot in Kevin Costner\u2019s 1990 Oscar-winning film.\r\n\r\nCourt documents say he was the leader of a cult-like group called \u201CThe Circle.\u201D Documents allege he used his position to gain the trust of Indigenous families and their children, and take underage wives.\r\n\r\nThe Nevada prosecution was put on pause as the actor appealed to the state\u2019s Supreme Court to dismiss the case. His lawyers have argued that his accusers wanted to have sex with him.\r\n\r\nChasing Horse is also facing criminal charges in Montana and British Columbia. California attorney Alexandra Kazarian, who has been retained by Chasing Horse on previous charges, did not immediately return a message seeking comment.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. arrest report alleges a British Columbia woman reported Chasing Horse to the RCMP, who contacted Las Vegas police, prompting the investigation that led to his arrest.\r\n\r\nThe woman alleged she was 13 years old when she met the actor while he was performing ceremonies in Canada. She alleges he began to have sex with her when she was 17.\r\n\r\nTsuut\u2019ina police, who serve the First Nation west of Calgary, said the prosecution of Chasing Horse in different legal jurisdictions has required significant planning and co-operation. In 2015, the Tsuut\u2019ina band council passed a resolution banning the actor from all community events.\r\n\r\n===========================================================\r\n\r\nClients are reminded to adhere to all listed restrictions and to check the terms of their licence agreements.

The 46-year-old is charged with 18 felonies accusing him of sexually abusing Indigenous women and girls for more than a decade. Chasing Horse and lawyers argue that his accusers wanted to have sex with him. His appeal filed Tuesday (9 MAY 2023) marks his latest attempt to end the case after a Nevada judge upheld Chasing Horse\u2019s indictment last month. The judge ruled that prosecutors presented enough evidence for a reasonable grand jury to return an indictment on charges of sexual assault, kidnapping and child abuse. Chasing Horse\u0027s trial was set to start May 1 but has been put on hold indefinitely while he appeals.\r\n\r\n===========================================================\r\n\r\nClients are reminded to adhere to all listed restrictions and to check the terms of their licence agreements.

It is very easy to fit this behaviour within the definition of article 2 of the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which is now part of the law of Kenya by virtue of article 2(5) of the constitution, as well as the International Crimes Acts number 16 of 2008.

Various of Chasing Horse in court\r\n\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nA Nevada judge on Friday  (07 APRIL 2023) threw out a drug trafficking charge against a \u201CDances With Wolves\u201D actor but upheld a Las Vegas grand jury\u2019s sweeping indictment on 18 sexual abuse-related felony crimes.\r\n\r\nIn her order issued late Friday afternoon, Clark County District Court Judge Carli Kierny said state prosecutors presented enough evidence for \u201Ca reasonable grand jury to conclude that the sexual assaults occurred against two minors\u0022 but found that \u201Cthere was no substantive testimony\u201D connecting Nathan Chasing Horse to the psilocybin mushrooms investigators found while searching his home.\r\n\r\nChasing Horse, 46, had asked Kierny to toss the entire indictment, saying his accusers wanted to have sex with him and that the mushrooms found inside a refrigerator in his home did not belong to him. One of his accusers was younger than 16 \u2014 the age of consent in Nevada \u2014 when she says Chasing Horse began abusing her.\r\n\r\nPublic defender Kristy Holston said she had no comment on the judge\u2019s ruling.\r\n\r\nA grand jury in Las Vegas indicted Chasing Horse in February on charges of sexual assault of a minor, kidnapping, child abuse, lewdness and drug trafficking. He has been in custody at a county jail since Jan. 31, when he was arrested by SWAT officers near the home he shared with his five wives in North Las Vegas.\r\n\r\nThe sexual abuse allegations date to the early 2000s and cross multiple U.S. states, including Nevada, Montana and South Dakota, according to the indictment. Chasing Horse also faces sexual abuse charges in Canada and the U.S. District Court in Nevada, as well as on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Montana.\r\n\r\nPolice and prosecutors say that in the decades since Chasing Horse\u0027s portrayal of Smiles a Lot in Kevin Costner\u2019s 1990 Oscar-winning film, he had marketed himself to tribes nationwide as a medicine man with healing powers who could communicate with higher beings. They accuse of him using his position to lead a cult known as The Circle, gain access to vulnerable girls and women, and take underage wives.\r\n\r\nOne of the victims was 14, authorities have said, when Chasing Horse told her that the spirits of their ancestors had instructed him to have sex with her.\r\n\r\n\u201CHer mom is ill,\u201D said Clark County prosecutor Stacy Kollins, \u201Cand she\u2019s told that her virginity is the only pure part of her left and she has to sacrifice this to maintain her mom\u2019s health.\u201D\r\n\r\nA trial in the state case is scheduled to begin on May 1. Chasing Horse has pleaded not guilty and invoked his right to a trial within 60 days of his indictment.\r\n\r\nHe is due back in court next week for a hearing on another motion asking the judge to grant him three separate trials. Chasing Horse and his attorneys argued in the motion that the sexual assault allegations and the drug trafficking charge are unrelated.\r\n\r\n===========================================================\r\n\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/a25608d22f3e4da1bdf0b519b75574b5",

His trial had previously been scheduled for April 17.\r\n\r\nA Clark County grand jury indicted Chasing Horse, 46, in late February on 19 counts that include charges of sexual assault of a child younger than 16, kidnapping, lewdness and child abuse. Chasing Horse, who is widely known for his portrayal of Smiles a Lot in Kevin Costner\u0027s 1990 Oscar-winning film, has pleaded not guilty and invoked his right to a trial within 60 days of his indictment.\r\n\r\nThe former actor, who has been in custody since his Jan. 31 arrest, is due back in court Wednesday morning for a hearing on a motion asking Kierny to dismiss the sweeping indictment. Chasing Horse and his lawyers argued in their motion that two women identified as victims in Nevada wanted to have sex with him.\r\n\r\nProsecutors and police have said the abuse allegations against Chasing Horse date to the early 2000s and span two countries and multiple states. He also faces criminal charges in U.S. District Court in Nevada and British Columbia, Canada, as well as on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Montana.\r\n\r\nChasing Horse is accused of using his position as a self-proclaimed medicine man to gain access to vulnerable Indigenous women and girls and take underage wives.

He has been in custody since his arrest Tuesday afternoon outside the North Las Vegas home that he shares with his five wives.\r\nHe appeared briefly in court in North Las Vegas on Thursday but did not speak before Justice of the Peace Belinda Harris scheduled a bail hearing for Monday. Chasing Horse has not been formally charged.\r\nOn Monday, Harris is expected to address Chasing Horse\u0027s custody status and could set bail after she hears from prosecutors, investigators, victims and the defendant\u0027s relatives.\r\nClark County Chief Deputy District Attorney Jessica Walsh told the judge Thursday that Las Vegas police detectives, FBI special agents and victims will speak at the hearing.\r\nLas Vegas police arrested Chasing Horse Tuesday following a months long investigation into alleged abuse that authorities said spanned two decades.\r\nKnown for his role as young Sioux tribe member Smiles a Lot in the Oscar-winning Kevin Costner film, Chasing Horse gained a reputation among tribes across the United States and in Canada as a so-called medicine man who performed healing ceremonies.\r\nHe is believed to be the leader of a cult known as The Circle whose followers believed he could communicate with higher powers, according to an arrest warrant.\r\nPolice said he abused his position, physically and sexually assaulted Indigenous girls and women, took underage wives and led the cult.\r\nChasing Horse was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, which is home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.\r\nA 50-page search warrant obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press said Chasing Horse trained his wives to use firearms, instructing them to \u201Cshoot it out\u201D with police officers if they tried to \u201Cbreak their family apart.\u201D If that failed, the wives were to take \u201Csuicide pills.\u201D\r\nDetectives who searched his home found firearms, 41 pounds (18.5 kilograms) of marijuana and psilocybin mushrooms, and a memory card with multiple videos of sexual assaults, according to an arrest report released Wednesday.\r\nAdditional charges could be filed related to the videos, the report said.\r\nThere was no lawyer listed in court records who could comment on his behalf and Las Vegas police said Chasing Horse was unable to give a jailhouse interview Wednesday.\r\nLas Vegas police said in the search warrant that investigators have identified at least six sexual assault victims, including one who was 13 when she says she was abused. Police also traced sexual allegations against Chasing Horse to the early 2000s in Canada and in multiple states including South Dakota, Montana and Nevada, where he has lived for about a decade.\r\n===========================================================\r\nClients are reminded: \r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/66f3ee5153e84daf9b8e05e1163d2d1b",

Wide, street\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nLas Vegas police on Tuesday arrested and raided the home of a former \u201CDances With Wolves\u201D actor turned alleged cult leader accused of sexually assaulting young Indigenous girls during a period spanning two decades, according to police records obtained by The Associated Press.\r\nNathan Lee Chasing His Horse, who goes by Nathan Chasing Horse, was taken into custody in the afternoon near the North Las Vegas home he is said to share with his five wives. SWAT officers were seen outside the two-story home in the evening as detectives searched the property. \r\nKnown for his role as the young Sioux tribe member Smiles a Lot in the Oscar-winning Kevin Costner film, Chasing Horse gained a reputation among tribes across the United States and in Canada as a so-called medicine man who performed healing ceremonies and spiritual gatherings and, police allege, used his position to abuse young Native American girls.\r\nHis arrest is the culmination of a monthslong investigation that began after police received a tip in October 2022. According to a 50-page search warrant obtained by AP, Chasing Horse is believed to be the leader of a cult known as The Circle.\r\nAnd it comes as state attorneys general and lawmakers around the U.S. are looking into creating specialized units to handle cases involving Native women.\r\nAccording to the document, Las Vegas police have identified at least six alleged victims and uncovered sexual allegations against Chasing Horse dating to the early 2000s in multiple states, including Montana, South Dakota and Nevada, where he has lived for about a decade.\r\nThere was no lawyer listed in court records for Chasing Horse who could comment on his behalf as of Tuesday evening. \r\nChasing Horse was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, which is home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.\r\nAccording to the warrant, he was banished in 2015 from the Fort Peck Reservation in Poplar, Montana, amid allegations of human trafficking.\r\n\u201CNathan Chasing Horse used spiritual traditions and their belief system as a tool to sexually assault young girls on numerous occasions,\u201D it reads, adding that his followers believed he could communicate with higher beings and referred to him as \u201CMedicine Man\u201D or \u201CHoly Person.\u201D \r\nAlthough the warrant includes details of crimes reported elsewhere, the arrest stems from crimes allegedly committed in Nevada\u0027s Clark County. They include sex trafficking, sexual assault of a child younger than 16 and child abuse.\r\nSome of the alleged victims were as young as 13, according to the warrant. One of Chasing Horse\u0027s wives was allegedly offered to him as a \u201Cgift\u201D when she was 15, while another became a wife after turning 16.\r\nChasing Horse also is accused of recording sexual assaults and arranging sex with the victims for other men who allegedly paid him.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/9c5116ad2d8447018464c644c9e25be6",

But an official investigator told reporters in the picture-postcard Swiss farming community of Cheiry where 23 bodies were found, many clad in coloured cloaks at a secret temple, that two people whom he did not identify were wanted for questioning. Investigator Andre Piller said police could not exclude the possibility that some people involved may have escaped alive, leaving 12 women, 10 men and a 10-year-old child in what he described as a \u0022waxwork museum\u0022 of death. In the Alpine mountainside hamlet of Granges, 160 km (100 miles) south of Cheiry, firemen pulled 25 corpses from the smouldering ruins of two chalets -- some of them children. In Quebec, Canada, police found the bodies of a man and a woman in the smoking ruins of a house in the small community of Morin Heights 80 km (48 miles) north of Montreal. As in Cheiry and Granges, an elaborate fire-starter system involving wires, timers, gas tanks and bags of petroleum had been set up. Police said all three incidents appeared clearly linked to a charismatic 45-year-old doctor, Luc Jouret, who heads a Canadian-based sect known as the \u0022Order of the Solar Temple\u0022 which tells its adherents to prepare for the end of the world. Jouret, a homeopath who has called himself a \u0022new Christ\u0022, owned two of the burned-out chalets in Grange and one of the two houses in Morin Heights. His portrait was also found in a large cellar un der the burned-out barn on the Cheiry farm.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/680e99d2bb1ea9e20eb33b0fd7e8c088",

      "description": "(18 Jan 2020) Preachers from a cult accused of kidnapping, torturing and killing members of a remote indigenous community near Panama\u0027s Caribbean coast were due to appear before a judge on Saturday.\r\nSeven people were killed in a bizarre religious ritual in which residents were rounded up by about 10 lay preachers and tortured, beaten, burned and hacked with machetes to make them \u0022repent their sins,\u201D authorities said.\r\nPolice freed 14 members of the Ngab\u00E9 Bugl\u00E9 indigenous group who had been tied up and beaten with wooden cudgels and Bibles.\r\nLocal prosecutor Rafael Baloyes described a chilling scene found by investigators when they made their way through the jungle-clad hills to the remote Ngab\u00E9 Bugl\u00E9 indigenous community on Tuesday. \r\nAlerted by three villagers who escaped and made their way to a local hospital for treatment earlier, police were prepared for something bad, Baloyes said, but were still surprised by what they discovered at an improvised \u201Cchurch\u201D at a ranch where a little-known religious sect known as \u201CThe New Light of God\u0022 was operating. \r\nAbout a mile (2 kilometres) away from the church building, authorities found a freshly dug grave with the corpses of six children and one adult. \r\nDi\u00F3medes Blanco, a member of the community who helped police in the rescue, said that shortly before the killings, two people in the sect told him about what they were doing.\r\nAnother community member, Pac\u00EDfico Blanco, said one of the church members told him about how \u0022if (the victims) did not believe on God then we had to kill them and torture them.\u0022\r\nThe murdered woman\u0027s husband, farmer Josu\u00E9 Gonz\u00E1lez, told the Associated Press he tried to rescue his wife and children, as well as a teenage neighbour, but was only able to retrieve a 5 year-old girl and a 7 year-old boy from the church. \r\nOne other son, 15, managed to escape on his own, despite being beaten by the fanatics.\r\nGonz\u00E1lez\u0027s pregnant wife, five of their children, and their 17 year-old neighbour were found in the mass grave outside the hamlet. \r\nWhile fanaticism sparked the tragedy, the area\u0027s isolation \u2014 and the poverty and lack of services for the indigenous Ngab\u00E9 and Bugl\u00E9 peoples \u2014 had a role.\r\nThe remote hamlet, nestled in the jungle of the indigenous Ngab\u00E9 Bugl\u00E9 enclave, is hours from the nearest clinic, or police force.\r\nBy the time authorities arrived by helicopter, it was too late for many. \r\nApparently, the sect is relatively new to the area, and had been operating locally only for about three months and there were few warning signs.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/2137a9a6bbe047519f1543817f8360c1",

      "description": "(14 Nov 2018) The survivors have journeyed over the past 40 years through grief over lost loved ones, feeling like pariahs, building new lives and, finally, acknowledging that many had a role in enabling the Rev. Jim Jones to seize control over his followers.\r\nAmong them is John Cobb, who was born in a black section of Indianapolis in 1960, when his mother and older siblings already were temple members.\r\nCobb and his family followed Jim Jones from Indiana to California and then to Guyana, where members of the Peoples Temple built an agricultural commune in the jungle.\r\nIn Jonestown, Cobb was part of Jones\u0027 personal security detail and saw the once-captivating minister strung out on drugs, afraid to venture anywhere for fear of his legal problems.\r\nCobb was playing in a basketball tournament in Guyana\u0027s capital, Georgetown, when U.S. Rep. Leo Ryan and a group of journalists arrived for a fact-finding mission to Jonestown.\r\nRyan\u0027s delegation was leaving with a small group of Jonestown defectors at a nearby airstrip when temple gunmen killed the congressman, three journalists and a church defector. Then Jones ordered members to drink a fruit drink laced with cyanide. A total of 918 people died that day, including more than 300 children.\r\nCobb and other surviving members of the basketball team, who refused Jones\u0027 order to return to Jonestown, regret they didn\u0027t return to the settlement sooner because they believe they could have saved at least some lives.\r\nCobb lost 11 relatives that day, including his mother, youngest brother and four sisters.\r\nNow 58, he owns a modular office furniture business in the East Bay and is married with a daughter. He and other survivors helped create the Jonestown memorial at Evergreen Cemetery in Oakland, Calif., where the remains of more than 400 victims were buried in a mass grave.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/2a73ab9e9d06de76139babb37be6f002",

      "description": "(14 Nov 2018) Forty-years on, the survivors of an epic murder-suicide ritual at a compound of the Reverend Jim Jones\u0027 Peoples Temple in Jonestown, northwestern Guyana, acknowlede that many had a role in enabling him to seize control over his followers.\r\nAmong them is John Cobb, who was born in a black section of Indianapolis in 1960, when his mother and older siblings already were temple members.\r\nCobb and his family followed Jones from Indiana to California and then to Guyana, where members of the Peoples Temple built an agricultural commune in the jungle.\r\nIn Jonestown, Cobb was part of Jones\u0027 personal security team and saw the once-captivating minister strung out on drugs, afraid to venture anywhere for fear of his legal problems.\r\nCobb was playing in a basketball tournament in Guyana\u0027s capital, Georgetown, when US Rep. Leo Ryan and a group of journalists arrived for a fact-finding mission to Jonestown.\r\nRyan\u0027s delegation was leaving with a small group of Jonestown defectors at a nearby airstrip when temple gunmen killed the congressman, three journalists and a church defector. Then Jones ordered members to drink a fruit drink laced with cyanide. A total of 918 people died that day, including more than 300 children.\r\nCobb and other surviving members of the basketball team, who refused Jones\u0027 order to return to Jonestown, regret they didn\u0027t return to the settlement sooner because they believe they could have saved at least some lives.\r\nCobb lost 11 relatives that day, including his mother, youngest brother and four sisters.\r\nNow 58, he owns a modular office furniture business in the East Bay and is married with a daughter. \r\nHe and other survivors helped create the Jonestown memorial at Evergreen Cemetery in Oakland, California where the remains of more than 400 victims were buried in a mass grave.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/9aa555ae2116aef173785ba27143cd15",

      "title": "Japan hangs 6 more members of cult behind subway gas attack",
      "description": "(26 Jul 2018) The last six members of a Japanese doomsday cult who remained on death row were executed on Thursday for a series of crimes in the 1990s including a sarin gas attack on Tokyo subways that killed 13 people.\r\nThirteen members of the group had received death sentences. The first seven, including cult leader Shoko Asahara, were hanged about three weeks ago. \r\nJapan has never executed so many people in one month, Justice Minister Yoko Kamikawa said. She called their crimes unprecedentedly heinous and said they should never be repeated.\r\nThe cult, which envisioned overthrowing the government, amassed an arsenal of chemical, biological and conventional weapons in anticipation of an apocalyptic showdown. \r\nNamed Aum Shinrikyo, or Supreme Truth, it was blamed for 27 deaths before authorities raided its compound near Mount Fuji in 1995 and captured Asahara nearly two months later.\r\nThe group\u0027s most notorious crime was the March 20, 1995, subway attack that sickened 6,000 people and sowed panic during the morning commute. \r\nThe attack woke up a relatively safe country to the risk of urban terrorism.\r\nCult members used umbrellas to puncture plastic bags, releasing Sarin, a deadly nerve agent, inside subway cars just as the trains approached the Kasumigaseki station, Japan\u0027s main government district.\u00A0\u00A0\r\nCommuters poured out of stations, and the streets were soon filled with troops in Hazmat suits and people being treated outside.\r\nKamikawa said it was a terrorist attack that terrified people even outside Japan.\r\nShizue Takahashi, wife of attack victim, held a news conference after the news of the latest executions.\r\nTakahashi said she was left tense after she heard the news and added that the suffering of the victims still continues even after the executions were carried out.\r\nFour of the six executed on Thursday released Sarin on the subway.\r\nThe two others were convicted in other crimes, including the 1989 murders of an anti-Aum lawyer and his wife and 1-year-old baby and a 1994 sarin attack in the city of Matsumoto in central Japan, which killed seven people and injured more than 140. \r\nAn eighth victim in Matsumoto died after being in a coma for a decade.\r\nThe executions were announced only after they had happened, as is the practice in Japan.\r\nAsahara, whose original name was Chizuo Matsumoto, founded Aum Shinrikyo in 1984. \r\nThe bearded, self-proclaimed guru recruited scientists and others to his cult, attracting people who were disillusioned with a modern, materialistic lifestyle.\r\nThe cult once claimed 10,000 members in Japan and 30,000 in Russia. It has disbanded, though nearly 2,000 people follow its rituals in three splinter groups, monitored by authorities. \r\n===========================================================\r\nClients are reminded: \r\n(i) to check the terms of their licence agreements for use of content outside news programming and that further advice and assistance can be obtained from the AP Archive on: Tel \u002B44 (0) 20 7482 7482 Email: info@aparchive.com\r\n(ii) they should check with the applicable collecting society in their Territory regarding the clearance of any sound recording or performance included within the AP Television News service \r\n(iii) they have editorial responsibility for the use of all and any content included within the AP Television News service and for libel, privacy, compliance and third party rights applicable to their Territory.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/23321c9ea6f4471ddc9655d13f8f4d05",

      "description": "(24 Jul 2018) An heiress to the Seagram\u0027s liquor fortune and three other people were arrested on Tuesday in connection with the investigation of a self-improvement organization accused of branding some of its female followers and forcing them into unwanted sex.\r\nClare Bronfman, a daughter of the late billionaire philanthropist and former Seagram chairman Edgar Bronfman Sr., surrendered to the FBI and pleaded not guilty to racketeering charges.\r\nA lawyer for Bronfman, Susan Necheles, sought her release on $25 million bond. But U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis set the amount at $100 million after hearing prosecutors label her a flight risk and learning she has a net worth of roughly $200 million, including a stake in an island resort in Fiji.\r\nThe 39-year-old Bronfman, who appeared in court wearing flip-flops and a T-shirt, was to be released under house arrest later Tuesday.\r\nBronfman, a former competitor in international equestrian show jumping competitions, is accused in an indictment of taking a number of steps to help NXIVM\u0027s founder and leader, Keith Raniere, exercise control over members of the upstate New York group, including identity theft, interception of electronic communications and money laundering.\r\nBronfman was part of an \u0022inner circle\u0022 of loyalists who \u0022committed a broad range of serious crimes from identity theft and obstruction of justice to sex trafficking, all to promote and protect Raniere and NXIVM,\u0022 U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue said in a statement.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/4499ee1bbfbc29a2cf9663c54b5f4b9f",

      "description": "(12 Jun 2018) A federal judge has denied bail for the founder of a purported self-help group under investigation for alleged sex-trafficking.\r\nKeith Raniere, who\u0027s been in custody since his arrest last month, appeared Tuesday in a Brooklyn court.\r\nProsecutors accuse Raniere of forming a barbaric secret society within NXIVM (NEHK\u0027-see-um), a group that over the years has attracted a following of minor celebrities and wealthy people.\r\nThe prosecutors allege the sub-group branded brainwashed victims with Raniere\u0027s initials during initiation ceremonies that turned them into his sex slaves.\r\nCatherine Oxenberg\u0027s daughter India was a member of the group.\r\n\u0022Keith can\u0027t make bail. I was incredibly relieved. I was thrilled at the judge\u0027s response to the bail package,\u0022 Oxenberg said outside of court.\r\nThe defense says the women were never abused. \r\nRaniere\u0027s attorney\u0027s said the judge left the door open to request bail in the future.\r\nRaniere wants to be released on bail using a trustfund set up anonymously. \r\n\u0022I mean at the end of the day, what the judge wants is the judge wants more transparency on the issues surrounding the trust,\u0022 Marc Agnifilo, attorney for Raniere, said.\r\nNXIVM announced on its website that it has temporarily suspended operations.\r\nActress Allison Mack, who\u0027s charged with helping Raniere, also was in court.\r\nMack, who played a teenage friend of Superman in the CW network, is on house arrest in California.\r\nMack and Raniere have pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking.

In so doing, Charles Manson became the leering face of evil on front pages across America and rewrote the history of an era.\r\nManson, the hippie cult leader who died of natural causes Sunday at age 83 after nearly half a century behind bars, orchestrated the slayings of pregnant actress Sharon Tate and six other people, butchered at two homes on successive August nights by intruders who scrawled \u0022Pigs\u0022 and \u0022Healter Skelter\u0022 (sic) in the victims\u0027 blood.\r\nThe slaughter horrified the world. To many, the collateral damage included the era of peace, love and flower power.\r\nThe Manson Family killings, along with the bloodshed later that year during a Rolling Stones concert at California\u0027s Altamont Speedway, seemed to expose the violent and drug-riddled underside of the counterculture and sent a shiver of fear through America.\r\nManson was every parent\u0027s worst nightmare. The short, shaggy-haired man with hypnotic eyes was a charismatic figure with a talent for turning middle-class youngsters into mass murderers.\r\nAt a former movie ranch outside Los Angeles, he and his devotees - many of them young runaways who likened him to Jesus Christ - lived commune-style, using drugs and taking part in orgies. Children from privileged backgrounds ate garbage from supermarket trash.\r\nIt was the summer of the first moon landing. War raged in Vietnam.

      "description": "(8 Aug 2014) More than 35 years after the infamous suicide-murder of some 900 people - many forced to drink a cyanide-laced grape drink - in Jonestown, Guyana, the cremated remains of nine victims were found in a dilapidated former funeral home in the city of Dover in the US, officials said on Thursday.\r\nThe grisly discovery brought back memories of a tragedy that killed hundreds of children and a US congressman and horrified Americans.\r\nAfter the deaths, bodies of 911 massacre victims were brought to Dover Air Force Base, home to the US military\u0027s largest mortuary.\r\nMany of the bodies were decomposed and could not be identified. \r\nWilliam Crawford, who lives directly across the street from the former funeral home, recalled when the bodies were transferred.\r\n\u0022We were wondering first why they brought them here. But then we realised that Dover Air Force Base has the largest facility for that type of thing, the largest mortuary on the East Coast, as I understand\u0022, he said.\r\nThe newly discovered remains were clearly marked, with the names of the deceased included on death certificates, authorities said.\r\nBut a spokeswoman for the Delaware Division of Forensic Science declined to release the names of the nine people to The Associated Press. \r\nShe said officials were working to notify relatives.\r\nShe also said the agency found the remains last week on a site visit prompted by a call from the property\u0027s current owner - a bank, according to Dover police.\r\nOfficials found 38 containers of remains, 33 of which were marked and identified.\r\nThe spokeswoman said the containers included remains from Jonestown.\r\nFuneral director Edward G. Minus Sr. died in 2012, according to an obituary.\r\nThe bank then took over the building.\r\n\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/2026da31e3ebbaf6715995fdb0125265",

That we had two people that may have attempted to commit suicide, or maybe in the process of attempting to commit suicide. We knocked on the door. There was no answer. We did open up the door with the key and found one person deceased in the hotel room and another person, unconscious, we woke him up, the deputies woke him up and were able to keep him awake until the fire department arrived.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Sergeant Don Crist, San Diego County Sheriff\u0027s Department\r\nThere were several similarities to the March mass suicide that police could identify,  including traces of poison and a suicide note mentioning the Hale-Bopp comet with suicide overtones.\r\nAlso, the way the bodies were discovered bore some resemblance to the Heaven\u0027s Gate suicides. \r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\u0022The deceased had a plastic bag over his head.

      "description": "(18 Nov 1998) English/Nat\r\nTwenty years ago, in November of 1978, the world was shocked by the mass suicide/murder of more than 900 followers of a religious cult leader named Jim Jones.\r\nIt happened in a part of Guyana, known as Jonestown.\r\nThe orgy of killing began after a fact-finding mission lead by a U-S Congressman and a team of journalists was attacked by the Jones followers as they were leaving the compound along with a number of disgruntled cult members. \r\nHaving killed Congressman Lee Ryan and four other members of the party, the Jones followers realised that the outside world would not leave them alone for long.\r\nJones gave instructions for cult members to drink poison and shot those who refused.\r\nTwenty years after the Jonestown massacre, the full story of exactly how and why the suicides and murders happened is still under dispute.\r\nSome believe the answers to those questions may lie in more than 5,000 pages of information the U.S. government has kept secret for two decades.\r\nOver the years, there have been rumors of CIA involvement.\r\nAmong the conspiracy theories to explain the massacre are the suggestions that C-I-A agents were posing as members to gather information and that the agency was conducting some kind of mind control experiment.\r\nIn 1980, the House Select Committee on Intelligence determined that the C-I-A was not involved with the Jones cult, known as the People\u0027s Temple, and had no advance knowledge of the mass murder-suicide.\r\nThe committee released a 782-page report, but kept more than 5,000 other pages secret.\r\nWithout those documents, it\u0027s hard to confirm or refute the speculations that have sprung up around Jonestown.\r\nWhat is known about the end of Jonestown is that on November 18, 1978, cult leader Jim Jones ordered more than 900 of his followers to drink cyanide-poisoned punch.\r\nAmong the dead: more than 270 children.\r\nOnly two years before, Jones had been the toast of San Francisco political circles. \r\nAs the charismatic leader of the People\u0027s Temple, an interracial organisation that helped the desperate - and voted by the thousands - he was courted by the likes of Mayor George Moscone and Willie Brown, an assembly man at the time.\r\nBut after an August 1977 magazine article detailed ex-members\u0027 stories of beatings and forced donations, Jones had abruptly moved his flock to Jonestown, a settlement in the Guyana jungle.\r\nIn May 1978, People\u0027s Temple member Deborah Layton slipped out of Guyana. \r\nShe went to the U-S consulate, and later the newspapers, with a warning: Jones was conducting drills for a mass murder-suicide.\r\nBut there was little official government action until November 1978 when U-S House of Representatives member Leo Ryan, who had been contacted by a number of people worried about their relatives in the People\u0027s Temple, decided to lead a\r\ndelegation of reporters and relatives to Jonestown.\r\nTheir visit began happily enough, but the mood soured after some Jonestown residents indicated they wanted to defect. \r\nThe group was ambushed as they tried to leave at a nearby airstrip.\r\nRyan and four others were summarily executed as they lay wounded on the ground after the initial attack.\r\nA sound man for NBC News, Steven Sung, told reporters at the time what it was like to see his partner, cameraman Bob Brown, killed and how he managed to escape the same fate.\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Steven Sung, NBC sound man\r\nLater that night, Jones told his followers \u0022the time has come for us to meet in another place.\u0022\r\nJones specifically had all of the children poisoned first to ease the cooperation of their families after their deaths.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/814589979bf2d95d0f4640d318c2c88f",

      "title": "USA: SCIENTOLOGY CHURCH FIGHTING AGAINST DISCRIMINATION",
      "description": "(22 Oct 1999) English/Nat\r\nThe Church of Scientology on Thursday began a fight against religious discrimination in Europe.\r\nGermany is at the centre of the uproar since it took the decision to ban the faith on the grounds that it is a cult, not a religion under the country\u0027s law.\r\nMembers of both the Senate and Congress passed a resolution in Washington which calls for a stand to be taken against such intolerance.\r\nCongressmen were joined by Scientology follower and actress Anne Archer at a news conference on Capitol Hill to highlight the joint resolution.\r\nThe Church of Scientology today won the first round in its battle against religious discrimination in Germany.\r\nThe faith has been banned in the country as it comes under a law which deems it to be a cult, not a religion.\r\nToday members of the Senate and Congress passed a resolution in Washington which calls for a stand to be taken against such religious intolerance not just in Germany but in other European countries. \r\nPopular among the rich and famous, Scientology is a relatively new form of religion which deals with the nature of truth and the fundamental laws of life.\r\nArizona Congressman Matt Salmon, himself a member of the Mormon Church, plans to introduce the legislation in the House in the coming weeks.\r\nThe U-S State Department\u0027s last six Human Rights reports have contained criticism of Germany\u0027s treatment of religious minorities.\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\u0022Things are a little bit more sophisticated now than at the end of World War Two.  But you feel the same oppression, the same control.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION:  Matt Salmon, Congressman, Republican - Arizona \r\nInternational Relations Committee Chairman, Congressman Benjamin Gilman called on the German government of Gerhard Schroeder to repeal laws passed by the previous government.\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\u0022The problem of religious intolerance in Europe is widely recognised, even in Europe itself and it should be obvious, especially to Europeans that intolerance is much more harmful than is any so called harm that may arise from adherence to one or another of the many new religions that have arisen in the world in the past few years. Germany is a nation that should be a leader with regard to tolerance and ought to be setting an example, but regrettably it is not doing so.  Indeed not only has countries such as Austria, Belgium and France joined Germany\u0027s efforts to suppress disfavoured groups on the basis of their religion or their belief, but newly developing democracies in Eastern Europe are tending to follow Germany\u0027s example.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION:  Benjamin Gilman, Chairman International Relations Committee, Democrat - New York\r\nActress Anne Archer, was also present at the news conference, plans to speak in Hamburg next Monday at a rally against religious discrimination.\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\u0022As a result of my first hand observation there is no question that thousands of people there need help because their voices are being suppressed.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION:  Anne Archer, actress\r\nAlthough herself a member of the Church of Scientology, Archer believes the problem is more widespread than solely affecting followers of her own religion.\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\nSUPER CAPTION:   Anne Archer, actress\r\nWhether Germany will lift the ban remains to be seen but members of this increasingly popular organisation look certain to put up a good fight.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/c0077b93b848a3a951b80acc44942acf",

      "description": "(18 Apr 1998) English/Nat\r\nFive years ago this Sunday, eighty people died when members of the \u0022Branch Davidian\u0022  cult set fire to their complex in Waco, Texas.\r\nThe fire followed a raid by U-S government agents - cult leader David Koresh and many  of his followers subsequently died.\r\nThe incident became a rallying point for extremists and anti-government groups. \r\nThis was the end of a standoff at the \u0022Branch Davidian\u0022 compound on April 19, 1993.\r\nPictures of flames sweeping through the building full of people is a painful memory for  many inside and outside the compound.\r\nEighty people, 18 of them children, and cult leader David Koresh died in the flames.\r\nThe siege had begun weeks earlier when 4 federal agents and 6 cult members were  killed in a gun battle.\r\nThe shooting broke out when agents tried to arrest Koresh on weapons charges.\r\nAfter just over 50 days of futile talks, agents sent in armoured vehicles to flush out the  cult members with tear gas.\r\nBut the compound erupted in fire.  \r\nIt\u0027s still a matter of speculation how the fire started. \r\nGovernment officials say the cult members started the fire themselves, but surviving  members claim otherwise.\r\nIt\u0027s been five years since the raid but the memories have not faded for the survivors and  cult members.\r\nMany of them still live in Waco and retain the rights to the property.  \r\nMost of the rubble is gone with the exception of a few relics.\r\nVictims\u0027 graves are dotted around the land. \r\nSheila Martin, a survivor lost her husband and daughter on that day.\r\nShe defends Koresh and criticises the government\u0027s actions from the day the standoff  began.\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\u0022I think it was the time that God allowed it to happen because of the different  circumstances that led up to it.  And as we stayed inside David said the more the  government comes and they show the world what they are made out of. People had a  chance to say well this is not a group of people that are against the government and are  fighting and have started something.  But in spite of all they were told, they were shown  that the government was the one who\u0027s bothering us. They came in, they were tearing  up  everything.  They were shooting on children that were inside, they didn\u0027t know where  they were.  And this morning as I thought of it, I said these were little babies. They said  they came to get a man, and these were little babies in there.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION:  Sheila Martin, survivor\r\nAccording to an expert on terrorism and cults, the incident at Waco can be seen as a  rallying point for extremists and anti-government groups. \r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\u0022Well I think that Waco is used primarily by the anti-government right today. It really  energised them.  And they used that to recruit members and to point at government  maleficence\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Dr Neil Livingstone, Cult and Terrorism Expert and Author\r\nOn the other hand,  \u0022Branch Davidian\u0022 members like Martin disagree with tactics of  death and destruction used by militias. \r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\u0022And so we don\u0027t want the militias to feel that,  well to see that, this is a situation that  just goes to prove what the government is like. They go right in there and do these  things.  And we\u0027re thankful that they say that they hate what happened to us. But we  would not want them to feel that, like something like with Timothy McVeigh, we would  never want any other children to die. We know the pain, we know what happened here  and why would we want something else, and we would not encourage anyone else to  get into that position.\u0022  \r\nSUPER CAPTION: Sheila Martin, Survivors\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/eddbc4fab30e621d903a9f9cff68da72",

It was a plantation and there was thing going on that  I knew were totally ungodly and inhumane.\u0022]\r\nWilliams and her family managed to flee Guyana just months before the mass suicide..\r\nShe was one of only a handful of members who Jones allowed to return to the U-S.\r\n [Notes:SOT We made it back out through the grace of God and our ability to negotiate with him because he was in a drug-induced state  so we convinced him it was in his best interest to let us go because  and to prove to the people here in the United States that someone could get out if they wanted to.\u0022]\r\n [Notes:FIle vid compound; photos]\r\nThirty years later .... Williams says she\u0027s using her experience to be a voice for those who died ...\r\nShe\u0027s now speaking out against Jones.\r\n [Notes:SOT \u0022He had in my opinion and I feel compelled to say this  ... he had 917 chances  to stop the annialation  and yet he continues to witness people dying one-by-one.\u0022]\r\n Jones died that same day of a gunshot wound to the head.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/d8ca8f069899e047054fce76698e5d82",

I think what it\u0027s been trying to do here is just to destroy the freedom of thought, the freedom of belief of the French people here.

Wide exterior of church\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nA French trial against the Church of Scientology is set to come to an end on Wednesday as the group and seven of its French leaders stand charged of organised fraud and illegal pharmaceutical activity.\r\nThe Paris trial began late last month and the French prosecutor in charge of the case has asked that fines of euro 2 (m) million (2.77 (m) million US dollars) be levied against the group and its French bookstore, if the two entities are found guilty. \r\nSuch fines are exceptionally high by French standards.\r\nSuspended prison sentences have also been requested against six of the group\u0027s French leaders.\r\nThe group, considered a sect in France, has faced prosecution and difficulties in registering its activities in many countries and could be dissolved if it is convicted.\r\nUnusually, the Paris prosecutor\u0027s office had recommended the charges be dropped, but the court agreed to take up the case.\r\nThe trial comes more than a decade after one of the three plaintiffs originally filed a complaint against the Church of Scientology. \r\nA young woman said she took out loans and spent the equivalent of euros 21-thousand (29,400 US dollars) on books, courses and \u0022purification packages\u0022 after being recruited by the group in 1998. \r\nWhen she sought reimbursement and to leave the group, its leadership allegedly refused.\r\nInvestigating judge Jean-Christophe Hullin spent years examining the group\u0027s activities and in his indictment criticised practices he said were aimed at extracting large sums of money from members and plunging them into a \u0022state of subjection.\u0022\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/706a152063512e4bd9c1f9b5db296f3c",

And we anticipate we\u0027re going  to start doing that probably late in the weekend, maybe first of the week, on Monday.\\\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Calvin Vine, supervising medical examiner investigator\r\nAutopsies on 21 of the 39 who died have shown that poisoning was the cause of death.\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\\\u0022We are, of course, proceeding with the preliminary conclusion that what we are looking  at here is in fact 39 suicides. We have nothing that would indicate differently at this  time. There are, however, a few things remaining to do. Most of you have either seen or  heard reference to what we would refer to as the \u0027goodbye tape\u0027. We have that tape. We  need to sit down with medical examiners crew, compare the personalities of the  depictions on that tape with the identities of the deceased to see if they line up and  match. We believe that the tape of course will, if those identities and personalities  match, we believe that of course there may well be some inferences that will lend  themselves to the conclusion of suicide.\\\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Jack Drown, San Diego County Under Sheriff\r\nThe 39 men and women are believed to have methodically killed themselves in the belief  that they would take a spaceship ride in a U-F-O trailing the Hale-Bopp comet.\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Jack Drown, San Diego County Under Sheriff\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/bb108e54957af4e6627dcb890944a49f",

The guns were purchased illegally in New Mexico and were to  be used to kill Turner, witnesses said.\r\n\r\nRajneesh left the U-S in late 1985 after pleading guilty to immigration fraud.

      "description": "(1 Mar 1995) Russian/Nat\r\n\r\nThe trial of the leaders of the Great White Brotherhood cult began in Kiev Wednesday,  more than a year after hundreds of cult followers threatened to commit mass suicide.\r\n\r\nYuri Kryvonohov and his wife Maria Tsvygun, the self-styled messiah of the cult, are  accused of a number of charges ranging from organizing civic unrest to violating state  property.\r\n\r\nThe trial of the two cult leaders took place in a packed courtroom just metres away from  St. Sofia\u0027s Square, where cult followers used to meet before the couple\u0027s arrest in  November 1993.\r\n\r\nMaria Tsvygun, known to cult members as Maria Devi Christos, the living god, was a  former communist youth leader and journalist.\r\n\r\nShe claims the cult has a following of 144,000 across the former Soviet Union, as well  as support in many Eastern European countries.\r\n\r\nAuthorities expect the couple of giving mind-altering drugs to their followers - many of  whom left home to join the cult.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (Russian)\r\n\u0027I thought that they were more sincere than the church, I didn\u0027t like the church but with  them I felt part of things.\u0027\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Cult follower Larissa Voloshina \r\n\r\nIn November 1993, hundreds of young White Brothers from all over the former Soviet  Union descended on Kiev for a ten-day prayer vigil, which was to prepare them for the  so-called day of reckoning.\r\n\r\nFour days before the predicted apocalypse date, Kryvonohov and Devi Christos were  arrested along with a group of cult members after allegedly entering and vandalizing the  ancient St. Sofia\u0027s Cathedral.\r\n\r\nAlthough many cult followers have deserted Kryvonohov, Devi Christos still retains  widespread support.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred witnesses are due to testify at what is expected to be a lengthy court  hearing.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/8cc41f0718a8e313604fcefb8234b9ce",

      "description": "(15 Apr 1995) Jap/Eng/Nat\r\n\r\nTokyo was on full alert Saturday in response to a prophecy by the leader of the Aum Shinrikyo cult, which is suspected of carrying out last month\u0027s nerve gas attack.\r\n\r\nShoko Asahara had predicted that something \\\u0022terrible\\\u0022 would happen on April 15th in Japan\u0027s capital.\r\n\r\nAlthough the streets were quiet for a Saturday those out ignored the prophecy.\r\n\r\nJapan\u0027s notorious cult leader, Shoko Asahara, prophesied a\r\nnatural disaster for Tokyo today (Saturday) and authorities were taking no chances.\r\n\r\nExtra police were on alert throughout the capital, especially in the subway and at major intersections.       \r\n\r\nSome shops were closed, many had extra staff on duty. Even so they  down-played the likelihood of any kind of attack.\r\n\r\nSubway stations closed certain vending machines, to avoid suspicious packages being hidden.\r\n\r\nEven the American Embassy put out an alert to its employees. The embassy recommended the employees exercise common sense and prudent security precautions while walking or travelling around town.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\r\n I did buy extra bottled water for my apartment in case something happened.\r\nSUPER CAPTION: American man\r\n\r\nBut most Tokyo residents ignored the threat.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE:\r\n\r\n I woke up and heard it on the news, but I\u0027m just going about my normal business\r\n\r\nSo far, Asahara\u0027s prophecy has not come true. But with a strong suspicion of his cult\u0027s involvement in the gas attack on the Tokyo subway last month, security forces remain on high alert in case Asahara\u0027s followers decide to try to make his forecast real.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/67333bcebb4e1a371c0dc26d7ecc1566",

      "description": "(21 May 1995) Japanese/Nat\r\n\r\nVillagers living near the Mount Fuji compound of the Aum doomsday cult want the  government to disband the sect and confiscate its land.\r\n\r\nCult guru Shoko Asahara - who is believed to have masterminded the nerve gas attacks  on the Tokyo subway - was arrested last week at the sect headquarters by the village of  Kamikuishiki.\r\n\r\nSince the nerve gas attacks the village has been thrust into the media spotlight but  locals want life to return to normal and the remaining Aum followers out.\r\n\r\nMount Fuji -- it\u0027s one of Japan\u0027s main tourist attractions.\r\n\r\nScores of city dwellers leave Tokyo and head out near its white peaks for weekends of  peace and quiet - and to pursue their favourite sports.\r\n\r\nBut these paragliders also have the perfect bird\u0027s eye view of the Aum cult compounds  which lie in the shadow of Mount Fuji.\r\n\r\nSect leader Shoko Asahara reckoned he would be able to free fly within three years,  claiming he could already levitate.\r\n\r\nBut now he\u0027s grounded in police custody - and likely to face charges of murder and  attempted murder for the nerve gas attack last March.\r\n\r\nSince March there has not been much peace or quiet in Kamikuishiki.\r\n\r\nPolice and an army of reporters, photographers and cameramen descended on the  farming village near Asahara\u0027s headquarters - plus hundreds of sightseers turned up for  a look.\r\n\r\nThe local supermarket has never been so busy with sales doubling in the last two  months.\r\n\r\nManager Motoaki Tsunoda has been rushed off his feet - but he doesn\u0027t expect things to  slow down for a while.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (Japanese)\r\n\u0022The boom will continue until the end of this year whether I like it or not because the  Japanese are really curious, they want to see something weird.

Maybe  the local or national government could purchase the cults land and use it to build a new  factory.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Akiteru Watanabe, Farmer\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (Japanese)\r\n\u0022The entire withdrawal (of Aum followers) is what I really want but some of the members  have donated their houses and land to the cult so they have nowhere to go. This is not  just an issue for us but also for the country as a whole.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Seiichi Takeuchi, Local Anti-Aum Organiser\r\n\r\nWith Asahara behind bars, the future of the cult is unclear.

      "description": "(1 Apr 1997) English/Nat\r\n\r\nInvestigators in San Diego say all the evidence points to suicide for 39 members of the  Heaven\u0027s Gate cult.\r\n\r\nThey believe there are no other members of the cult beyond the 39 who killed  themselves last week at a mansion near San Diego.\r\n\r\nAnd officials say they\u0027re ruling out criminal charges as the probe into the incident winds  down. \r\n\r\nOfficials began moving the white body bags containing the remains of cult members  from a refrigerator truck at the San Diego County medical examiner\u0027s office on Monday.\r\n\r\nThey were placed in unmarked vans which then carried the corpses off to mortuaries.  Eleven bodies had been transferred by midday.\r\n\r\nOfficials say relatives had been located for all but two of the 39 victims.\r\n\r\nNames and other details about the Heaven\u0027s Gate cult members were released in the  hope relatives could be found. \r\n\r\nSan Diego police investigators say they\u0027re confident there are no other active members  of the cult beyond the 39 who took their own lives last Wednesday.\r\n\r\nAnd with their probe of the case already winding down, San Diego officials are not  altering the conclusion that it was anything other than mass suicide. \r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE:\r\n\u0022The video tape discovered and observed, the information obtained from sources all  indicate that this was a voluntary situation. They ingested the drugs on their own, they  may or may not have been influenced, but we\u0027ll never know that. But at this stage this is  considered a mass suicide investigation.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Lt. Jerry Lipscomb, San Diego County Sheriff\u0027s department\r\n\r\nInvestigators were still trying to determine the source of the drug phenobarbital used in  the suicide, but Lipscomb said he did not think that would lead to charges.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE:\r\n\u0022We\u0027re not going to charge anyone with anything, and who would we charge. The drugs  could be obtained legally. So there\u0027s no charges going to be persued by us in any  case.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Lt. Jerry Lipscomb, San Diego County Sheriff\u0027s department\r\n\r\nSan Diego County Medical Examiner Brian Blackbourne said eight male victims of the  cult had been castrated, including cult leader Marshall Applewhite. \r\n\r\nHe also said the bodies were being tested for the H-I-V aids virus, but only because of  interest by relatives. But he said none of the victims had a terminal illness.\r\n\r\nMembers of the nomadic group, which made its living working on Internet web sites,  were found dead last Wednesday in a rented mansion in exclusive Rancho Santa Fe.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/b9c64460e999fa241e8dafd271c165b8",

He\u0027ll be able to clone himself, walk through walls and speak every language.\r\n\r\nChen himself explained some more about the church at the press conference.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (Mandarin)\r\n\u0022Two-thousand years ago, I was the father of Jesus Christ.  Two thousand and five hundred years ago, Jesus Christ was my son.  That is why I am so sad about history, and according to the revelation of God, God can appear in a human body, but he comes not to judge people, not to make the final judgement, but to save people.  Most parts in the Bible are not the true words of god.  They are the revelations of devils and demons.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Hon Ming Chen, Church Leader\r\n\r\nChurch members also predicted God will make a T-V announcement on March 25th -- to be seen only on \u0022Channel 18\u0022 in the U-S.\r\n\r\nIf March comes and goes without the Almighty\u0027s appearance, they\u0027ll say they\u0027ll just pack up and return home.\r\n\r\nBut for the mean time the group members will spend the next couple of months patiently waiting for God to arrive in Garland.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/7a252eea69f836b541933ffded2a488e",

      "title": "USA: JONESTOWN GUYANA MASSACRE 20 YEARS ON (4)",
      "description": "(18 Nov 1998) English/Nat\r\n\r\nA group of survivors of the Jonestown deaths marked the twentieth anniversary on Tuesday night with a three-hour prayer vigil.\r\n\r\nSurvivors of the tragedy in which 900 people died, remembered their own narrow escapes from the Jonestown sect\u0027s commune and counted their blessings to be alive.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most famous survivor, Deborah Layton - who alerted the world that people were held against their will - is touring the U-S with a new book about the cult.\r\n\r\nIn a church in San Francisco, the survivors\u0027 thank their lucky stars they are alive.\r\n\r\nTheir stories reflect the luck and courage of their escape.\r\n\r\nOne survivor helped a small group escape the commune by telling guards he had organised a picnic.\r\n\r\nJust by chance, he escaped the tragedy that took place in the People\u0027s Temple in Jonestown in the ex-British colony of Guyana.\r\n\r\nThe adopted son of Jim Jones, Jim Jones Jr, escaped death because he and his brother had gone into town to see a basketball game.\r\n\r\nThe younger Jones said it was God who made it possible for him to hug one of the women he had pulled to safety.\r\n\r\nHe said he attended the service to heal old wounds.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\u0022I think, one, is forgiveness, forgiveness for myself for surviving. I think, two, is forgiveness for the failures of Rev Jim Jones, he is not God, he is only a man. And when many people placed him in a God-like role he then believed it. And that\u0027s the tragedy of Jonestown.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: (English) Jim Jones, Jr., Adopted son of Jim Jones\r\n\r\nOne of Jonestown\u0027s most famous survivors is marking the anniversary by touring with a new book about her experience.\r\n\r\nDeborah Layton joined Jim Jones and his People\u0027s Temple after graduating from boarding school at the age of 17.\r\n\r\nAfter more than seven years in the group, Layton followed Jones to Guyana ... and it was there that she began to realise this leader was terribly dangerous.\r\n\r\nIn her recently released autobiography, \u0022Seductive Poison,\u0022 Layton describes the so-called \u0022white nights,\u0022 or weekly suicide drills.\r\n\r\nShe recalled what happened to those who refused to join in.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\u0022A mother, for example, who would say, \u0027No, I don\u0027t want to kill my child, I wont do that\u0027, she as an example to us would be taken from that child and drugged and kept in the medical unit, comatose.  So your choices were, you follow, you act like your part of the team and somehow you hope you can figure a way out.  Those people, you know, in the very end, what seems comforting to people to say these people committed suicide, they didn\u0027t, they were murdered, they died not wanting, they were murdered by Jim Jones.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Deborah Layton, Jonestown Survivor\r\n\r\nLayton managed to escape the guarded compound, leaving her brother and dying mother behind.\r\n\r\nShe says in Jonestown, the sect\u0027s leader became increasingly angry and paranoid following a string of negative press reports.\r\n\r\nAnd she knew his talk of a mass suicide would soon become a reality.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\u0022His paranoia just grew and became just a malignant tumour upon him and he could have let those people live but he wanted to make a point and a statement.  All those good people who joined for the most wonderful reasons, who wanted to be part of something bigger than themselves where used as fodder in the end, so that he could make his point, don\u0027t anyone mess with me.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Deborah Layton, Jonestown Survivor\r\n\r\nAmong the dead were more than 270 children.\r\n\r\nArmed guards shot anyone who refused.\r\n\r\nEven two decades later, the scars from the tragedy are thick and deep.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/8c1b1f7c19986426648e7f1b31d305d7",

      "description": "(3 Aug 1999) Spanish/Japanese/Nat\r\n\r\nA small town in Mexico called the New Jerusalem has become home to an apocalyptic cult of over two hundred residents who believe the world will end before the year two thousand.\r\n\r\nThey call themselves the \u0027spiritual order\u0027 and maintain that their incessant prayer is in preparation for their \u0027long journey\u0027 after the end of the world.\r\n\r\nDisillusioned members accuse the group of being religious fanatics heading towards mass suicide.\r\n\r\nThe order prays almost 24 hours a-day, believing that their souls will be saved as they embark on what they say will be their long journey after the apocalypse.\r\n\r\nMembers that have been expelled from the group accuse the Christian fundamentalist spiritual order of being religious fanatics preparing for a ritualistic mass suicide before the millennium.\r\n\r\nNeither the church authorities nor government officials have any idea about the group\u0027s religious origins or motivations.\r\n\r\nSince the secret cult was established in Mexico in 1973 no one has managed to enter the compound to obtain an interview with their leader Papa Nabor.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (Spanish)\r\n\u0022Well, I don\u0027t know really. I feel they are all being fooled. Since we arrived here they have been saying that the world is going to end and look... it is still here. It is something that only God can know.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Isabel Diaz, Former Cult member\r\n\r\nThe members of the cult come from all walks of life and are united by their vows of poverty.\r\n\r\nThey agree to a severe daily ritualistic practice that, if broken, brings immediate expulsion.\r\n\r\nThey are also bound by rules that require a certain amount of work on behalf of the church and a vow to refrain from intoxicants and physical contact.\r\n\r\nPregnancy is also forbidden.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (Spanish)\r\n\u0022Like everything wholesome that is bathing in the grace of God. That is what indicates to another life. Not life of this earth but the promised life in heaven.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Papa Nabor, cult leader\r\n\r\nDespite its secrecy, the sect has no walls surrounding the compound.\r\n\r\nWhen police raided it looking for poisons to be used in a mass suicide they found nothing more than twenty five people dressed in white fervently praying.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (Spanish)\r\n\u0022They say in the compound that mass practised out here is meaningless. That it only means something in there. That I do not understand.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Antolina Martinez Rubio, expelled cult member\r\n\r\nWhatever the rumours surrounding the cult, the only evidence against them is that they are profoundly secretive.\r\n\r\nAnd the secrecy and rumours heightens the fear that local residents have towards the group which constantly tells them that the world will end any day soon and the wrath of God will befall them.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/e84f8764c63d66f8a12ab10f23905277",

      "description": "(9 Jan 1999) Natural Sound  \r\n\r\nFourteen members of an American doomsday cult are on their way home after being booted out of Israel.\r\n\r\nPolice took them to Ben Gurion airport on Friday and put them on the flight to Toronto - from there, they\u0027ll make a connection back to their Denver home. \r\n\r\nThe members of the Concerned Christians are suspected of plotting attacks in Jerusalem, believing that would hasten the return of Jesus Christ. \r\n\r\nThey deny doing anything wrong and no charges were filed - but Israel deported them nonetheless.\r\n\r\nFour police cars and vans took the group, including six children, to Ben Gurion International Airport near the Israeli capital Tel Aviv.\r\n\r\nArriving at 2000 GMT at the airport, they were then to catch an Air Canada flight to Toronto, with a connection to Denver, Colorado.\r\n\r\nTwo cult members covered their heads with coats when they spotted T-V cameras at the airport\u0027s Shalom Gate. \r\n\r\nNone responded to questions shouted out by reporters.\r\n\r\nThere is growing concern in Israel in the run up to the close of the millennium.\r\n\r\nIsraelis fear the Concerned Christians - as the group call themselves - are only a forerunner of hundreds of fanatics who will be drawn to Israel for what they expect to be the Second Coming of Christ.\r\n\r\nMillennial researchers say such extremists could turn violent if their hopes are not met. \r\n\r\nOther scenarios speak of possible mass suicides at holy sites.\r\n\r\nIsrael\u0027s police have created a task force to try to grapple with the problem.\r\n\r\nArriving in Israel in September, the cult members had settled in two homes in the wooded suburbs of Mevasseret Zion and Moza and were eventually placed under police surveillance.\r\n\r\nThe homes were raided earlier this week and the 14 were detained. \r\n\r\nThree cult members were questioned by police about alleged plots to carry out acts of violence at Jerusalem\u0027s holy sites in an attempt to hasten the return of Jesus.\r\n\r\nThe cult members denied wrongdoing and no charges were filed, but they were deported anyway.\r\n\r\nOn Friday morning, two handcuffed members of the group had been brought by security agents back to the home in Mevasseret Zion to pick up their luggage. \r\n\r\nThe bags were carried out by the agents.\r\n\r\nAfter the convoy arrived at the airport, two policemen presented the cult members\u0027 passports to the Air Canada check-in counter. \r\n\r\nPolice said security agents would accompany the group on the flight.\r\n\r\nEarlier on Friday, at Jerusalem\u0027s Al Aqsa mosque, prayer leader Hayan al-Idrisi referred to the cult in his sermon to more than 250-thousand worshippers.\r\n\r\nAccording to one scenario cited by millennium researchers, Christian extremists might try to damage Al Aqsa, Islam\u0027s third holiest shrine, to pave the way for rebuilding the Jewish Temple.\r\n\r\nThe rebuilding of the Temple is considered by some Christians a necessary step towards the return of Christ.\r\n\r\nAl-Idrisi claimed the Denver group plotted to destroy Al Aqsa.\r\n\r\nHowever, police never made such an accusation. \r\n\r\nAn Israeli police source only said Al Aqsa is only one possible location for a violent act by Christian fanatics.\r\n\r\nThe Israeli lawyer who briefly represented three group members said he was never shown the alleged evidence against his clients.\r\n\r\nHe also said the three did not want to return home because they feared the United States would be destroyed soon.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/b24bcd9b90b6b8d1c05177bdfe14ef36",

      "description": "(21 Mar 2000) English/Nat\r\n\r\nPrisoners are being used to dig large common graves for hundreds of cult members believed to have committed suicide in Uganda on Friday.\r\n\r\nPolice say more than 330 sect members died in the church fire in Kanunga, near Uganda\u0027s capital.\r\n\r\nMany of the victims were women and children.\r\n\r\nLocals brave enough to visit the burned hulk of the former church hall faced a gruesome sight - the charred remains of Ugandan cult members who, it\u0027s believed, doused themselves with inflammable liquid and set themselves alight on Friday. \r\n\r\nKanunga is 215 miles (350 kilometres) southwest of Uganda\u0027s capital of Kampala.\r\n\r\nPolice believe most of the victims here were women.\r\n\r\nThey have counted the bodies of 78 children, and put the total number of dead inside the church at 330.\r\n\r\nAnother five bodies were spotted through a hole in a nearby pit latrine.\r\n\r\nThe 10-year-old Christian sect, known as the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God, was founded by Cledonia Mwerinde, a former prostitute who had the chapel built on the grave of her father.\r\n\r\nThe sect had about 1,000 members in nine districts in Uganda and was legally registered as a non-governmental organisation.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (Rukiga)\r\n\u0022I left this place because of the hard labour. Three times a week, we were prevented from eating and we were not allowed to have sex. We were also discouraged from speaking and we communicated using gestures.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Turyakira Ivan, Former Cult Member\r\n\r\nOn Monday, prisoners were used to dig a long trench - a common grave, and final resting place for the five main cult leaders and their hundreds of followers.\r\n\r\nLater reports, however, suggest only two leaders\u0027 bodies had been positively identified - the manager of the sect\u0027s farm and \u0022a priest.\u0022\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\u0022The leader of this cult who was called Joseph Kibweteere, we don\u0027t know up to now where he is. Supposedly some of his family members are saying that he had come to his end and previously there were reports that he had gone to hospital for treatment so up to now we don\u0027t know where he is.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION:  Bakandema William, District Information Officer\r\n\r\nAs a bulldozer shovelled corpses into a trench, locals were left asking how this could happen and whether it could happen again. \r\n\r\nThey fear Syncretic Christian religious sects are mushrooming across Africa as people become disillusioned with the inability of politicians to improve their lives.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/2e399781580fea0b3eec0d55278fda9d",

      "description": "(2 Apr 2000) English/Nat\r\nTOKO MATERIAL \r\n\r\nUganda\u0027s leaders called their people to prayers and mourning on Sunday in Kanunga, the hilltop base of the Christian doomsday sect involved in the deadliest cult tragedy in modern history.\r\n\r\nGovernment and religious leaders from various denominations attended the memorial service in the southwestern village, where a March 17 blaze inside a sealed church burned hundreds of members to death.\r\n\r\nSince then, mass graves at three other sect compounds have yielded hundreds more bodies, many stabbed and strangled.\r\n\r\nUganda\u0027s government said Sunday\u0027s service was meant to console the families and assure the nation that it would pursue those who orchestrated the deaths.\r\n\r\nBefore the service, the country\u0027s Vice President Speciosa Wandira Kazibwe visited the church site in the Kanunga cult compound and laid flowers at the graves of the dead.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\u0022The relatives were murdered and the government is going to do all it can to put the leaders of this cult on the hook. However, whatever consolation (can) you give to people when they lose their relatives like this.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Speciosa Wandira Kazibwe, Vice President of Uganda\r\n\r\nIn the sect compound, a classroom blackboard bore the ominous words, \u0027Let us go and burn\u0027.\r\n\r\nThis might have sufficed as a neat, if tragic, explanation for the fate of followers of a Christian fringe sect whose end-of-the-world prediction failed to come true.\r\n\r\nIf not for the bodies of six men found in the compound\u0027s latrine, the notion that a sect with hopes for the end of the world had immolated itself might have prevailed.   \r\n\r\nBut now the deaths are being treated as mass murder.\r\n\r\nIt\u0027s thought key cult leaders may have survived the slaughter, fleeing with belongings their followers surrendered in order to join the sect.\r\n\r\nThe 10-year-old Christian sect, known as the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God, became popular after it was joined by Cledonia Mwerinde, a former prostitute.\r\n\r\nShe sold her spiritual wares to the gullible and the searching, particularly among the ranks of disaffected Roman Catholics, and gained daunting power over nearly 1-thousand followers, many of who apparently later became her victims.   \r\n\r\nHer ex-husband, Eric Mazima, said she deserved death or a prison sentence for what she had orchestrated.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE (Bakiba) \r\n\u0022I\u0027ll be very pleased, very interested to find her in prison, in custody or dead , because what she did does not please me at all\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Eric Mazima, Ex-husband of Cledonia Mwerinde\r\n\r\nNo sect member, past or present, has confirmed the common belief that the failure of the world to end on December 31 spurred members to demand belongings they had surrendered to Mwerinde to join the sect. \r\n\r\nIn turn, the reasoning goes, that inspired an insurrection that was put down with murder.   \r\nEvents leading up to the March 17 conflagration in Kanungu suggest a well-conceived plan - \u0022mass suicide\u0022 as an alibi to cover up murders of nearly 400 men, women and children that already had been committed over the previous two weeks. \r\n\r\nThe memorial ceremony on Sunday was held at a football pitch in Kanungu and was attended by church leaders from all over the country, as well as the Vice President.\r\n\r\nThey had 924 deceased people to mourn, and it\u0027s still not clear how their deaths were orchestrated, all within a 50-mile (an 80-kilometer) radius among green hills and volcanic lakes in southwestern Uganda. \r\n\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/3eeaef822ad3b047977bff4f286ad66f",

      "description": "(25 Mar 2000) English/Nat\r\n\r\nA mound of dirt is the only memorial to 153 members of a doomsday Christian sect buried in a mass grave in Buhunga sub-county, Uganda.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the bodies came nearly a week after more than 300 other members of the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments were burned alive in Kanungu.\r\n\r\nThe gruesome discovery of another mass grave in Uganda, just a week after 300 members a doomsday Christian sect were burnt alive, has increased fears that similar graves may be found across the country.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, villagers discovered three mass graves, which were dug into the dirt floors of two small rooms of a building belonging to the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments, in Buhunga.\r\n\r\nLast week 300 members of the same sect died in a fire in a makeshift church in Kanungu, 30 kilometres (20 miles) from Buhunga. \r\n\r\nThe Ugandan authorities fear that more corpses have yet to be discovered across the East African nation.  \r\n\r\nOn Friday, police exhumed the bodies at Buhunga, examined them, and then reburied them in a single grave.\r\n\r\nUgandan Police said some of those buried in the mass grave at Buhunga appeared to have been strangled or hacked to death.\r\n\r\nHenry Ndyambahika, a local council member, said that the bodies had been buried over a period of months - some bodies four months ago, some six weeks ago and some much more recently.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English) \r\n\u0022Some of them were hit on the head and others were tied with ropes. The others I think they died a natural death.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Naubhika Henry, Chairperson, Buhunga sub-county\r\n\r\nMinister of Internal Affairs Edward Rugumayo said in the capital, Kampala, that police had been mobilized across the country to search buildings and land belonging to the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments.\r\n\r\nBut for the families of those who died here, nothing can bring their loved ones back.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English) \r\n\u0022My sister died here.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Kika Adivn, Victim\u0027s Sister\r\n\r\nNdyambahika said the sect members in Buhunga sold all their property a week before the Kanungu inferno, then went to Kanungu. \r\n\r\nA few hours after the people there burned to death, some of the sect members returned, burning down their own compound.\r\n\r\nSince no one remained, authorities said they believed that someone responsible fled the area.\r\n\r\nThe exact number of deaths in the Kanungu fire remains unclear, as many of the corpses were reduced to ashes.\r\n\r\nKanungu is 345 kilometres (215 miles) southwest of Kampala. \r\n\r\nAll those deaths are now being treated as murders.\r\n\r\nAt first, police had thought the adult victims in the church inferno were willing participants, and considered only the 78 children who died there as murder victims.\r\n\r\nBut after the second discovery, police began treating all the deaths as homicides.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/f76d3adcaf7ec6e991d2807a75c6ccf1",

      "description": "(21 Jul 2000) English/Nat\r\nXFA \r\nFalun Gong members held a peaceful protest outside the Chinese embassy in the U-S capital, Washington, on Thursday.\r\n\r\nThe event marked the first anniversary of the Chinese government\u0027s crackdown on the group.\r\n\r\nA spokesman for the Chinese embassy condemned the movement as a dangerous, mind-controlling cult. \r\n\r\nFounded eight years ago, Falun Gong attracted (M) millions of followers in China with its blend of slow-motion exercises, meditation and ideas drawn from Buddhism and Taoism. \r\n\r\nMore than a hundred Falun Gong protesters stood vigil outside the Chinese Embassy in Washington D-C.\r\n\r\nFalun Gong was founded eight years ago by a former government clerk Li Hongzhi.\r\n\r\nHis whereabouts are unknown, but the popularity of his movement has been in no doubt.\r\n\r\nFalun Gong\u0027s blend of slow-motion exercises, meditation and religious philosophy has appealed to (M) millions within China. \r\n\r\nBut its popularity was seen as a threat by the government there and Thursday represented the first anniversary of China\u0027s crackdown on the group. \r\n\r\nFalun Gong says 24 members of the movement were killed whilst in custody and thousands of others were arrested and detained. \r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English) \r\n\u0022By doing the exercises, and increasing our mind-nature Xin-Xing, we are becoming a good person, and have a healthy body. And if a hundred million people are doing this, we are saving a lot of - tons of - money for the government. What\u0027s wrong with it? I think it\u0027s only good for the government, for the whole world for the whole society.\u0022 \r\nSUPER CAPTION: Tian Lun, Falun Gong Practitioner\r\n\r\nAlthough senior figures within Falun Gong say it\u0027s a purely spiritual movement with its roots in Buddhism, the Chinese government has branded it a cult and an illegal political movement.\r\n\r\nThe press counsellor at the Chinese Embassy in Washington, Zhang Yuanyuan, said Falun Gong supporters have joined with anti-Chinese forces, an action he believes belies their spiritual claims of truthfulness and compassion.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English) \r\n\u0022There are forces, this is no secret, forces in the world who sort of disapprove of some of China\u0027s policies, and the Falun Gong, apparently, is a handy tool for them to use.\u0022 \r\nSUPER CAPTION: Zhang Yuanyuan, Press Counselor, Chinese Embassy\r\n\r\nZhang also said that more than 98 percent of the \u0022old-time practitioners\u0022 have made a \u0022clean break\u0022 with the group.\r\n\r\nBut when asked to explain how the government determined the statistic, he referred only to anecdotal evidence.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English) \r\n\u0022The Falun Gong has lost it\u0027s credibility, has lost it\u0027s base in China. But it is still quite a powerful force. It still has some following inside the country and around the world. So our struggle - we cannot rest assured - until we win complete victory against the Falun Gong.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Zhang Yuanyuan, Press Counselor, Chinese Embassy\r\n\r\nZhang repeated government accusations that the group cheats its followers and has caused hundreds to die by convincing them to refuse medical treatment. \r\n\r\nHe said their leaders use them as \u0022cannon fodder against the law of the land.\u0022\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/6ae2aba96331189e856f1ef2e2216e6a",

      "description": "(27 Oct 2000) Christianity is the fastest growing religion in eastern, sub-Saharan Africa, and one of the reasons for its success is its ability to subsume other cultures.  It\u0027s resulted in what some might see, as an unholy alliance between Christianity and the culture of the witchdoctor. Many Africans still see their more traditional spiritual leaders as a necessary aspect of life, and have no qualms about combining the two faiths. But in East Africa religion is being manifested in many guises; from the witchdoctor\u0027s healing to the mass suicide of a religious cult in Uganda.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/7213675f07f936af7a189486e0c2207a",

      "description": "(30 Jan 2003) \r\n\r\n1. Set up of Israeli spokesperson for Raelian religious sect, Kobi Drori\r\n2. SOUNDBITE (Hebrew) Kobi Drori, spokesperson for the Raelians in Israel: \r\n\u0022The parents got scared after so many efforts were made to bring this child into the world, after ten failed attempts of in-vitro fertilisation. That\u0027s why they decided to leave the US and move to another country and it seems that they chose Israel.\u0022\r\n3. Cutaway Raelian symbol worn as necklace\r\n4. SOUNDBITE (Hebrew) Kobi Drori, spokesperson for the Raelians in Israel:\r\n\u0022It seems, as has been published, that the parents are Jewish and had no problems getting Israeli citizenship for the child. In no way did they want to give the child American citizenship, in order to prevent the American courts taking the child away from her parents. That\u0027s why the Florida court judge decided to dismiss the case against them.\u0022\r\n5. Drori walking away\r\n\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\n\r\nAn Israeli spokesman for a religious sect that claims to have created the first human clone has confirmed that the child has been brought to Israel.\r\n\r\nIn December, the company Clonaid announced it had performed the first successful cloning of a human, an infant it called Eve. \r\n\r\nKobi Drori told APTN on Thursday that he believed the baby girl had been brought into the country legally.\r\n\r\nAlthough Israeli law does not allow cloning, Drori said it did not prevent cloned people from entering the country.\r\n\r\nIsraeli Justice Ministry officials said they were looking into the matter. \r\n\r\nOn Wednesday a Florida judge threw out a petition seeking the appointment of a guardian for the child, after Clonaid chief Brigitte Boisselier announced the the clone was in Israel.\r\n\r\nThe company has never delivered on a promise to present mother and child to DNA testing. \r\n\r\nThe religious sect behind Clonaid, a group called the Raelians, believes life on earth was started by extraterrestrials. \r\n\r\nClonaid claimed last week that a third cloned child, a boy, had been born in Japan. It said clone No. 2, a girl,\r\nwas born to a Dutch lesbian on January 3.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/ce9648448f9ae9a12801394bbf2750ac",

      "title": "HONG KONG: FALUN GONG: NEW ANTI CULT LEGISLATION",
      "description": "(31 Oct 1999) English/Nat\r\n\r\nChina has passed new anti-cult legislation in an attempt to eradicate the banned Falun Gong movement. \r\n\r\nTheir action paves the way for Falun Gong leaders to be given lengthy prison terms and possibly the death penalty.\r\n\r\nPolice have been ordered to smash all cult activity, and reports from Beijing say they have quelled the week-long series of protests by defiant but peaceful Falun Gong members.\r\n\r\nBut in Hong Kong, where the spiritual group is still allowed to exist, the group is stepping up its activities to draw attention to the fate of its followers on the mainland.\r\n\r\nAfter Friday\u0027s silent demonstration outside the central government offices in Hong Kong, Falun Gong followers chose a Sunday afternoon for another demonstration on Hong Kong\u0027s peak, an area popular as a weekend day-out destination.\r\n\r\nMembers of the banned spiritual group are arrested on the mainland but in Hong Kong they are still free to follow their beliefs and to demonstrate in public.\r\n\r\nFor six days, they have been maintaining a small vigil outside the offices of the New China News Agency.\r\n\r\nBut they say they intend to increase the scale and frequency of events like this, designed to increase public awareness of their belief and of the persecution they suffer in mainland China.\r\n\r\nYesterday China\u0027s National People\u0027s Congress passed a new law that increases the power of the police and the courts to prosecute followers of spiritual beliefs that the Chinese government has dismissed as \u0022cults\u0022. \r\n\r\nIn passing this law, the National People\u0027s Congress exhorted police and the courts to be \u0022on full alert of cult activities and to smash them rigorously.\u0022\r\n\r\nBy tightening the law on cults, the communist government speeded the crackdown toward trials of principal members already in custody. \r\n\r\nBut the need for new measures shows how threatened Chinese leaders feel by Falun Gong, the alternatives it offers and how undaunted its followers remain more than three months into a ban on the widely popular group.\r\n\r\nAlthough defiant, members are shocked at the Chinese move to legislate against them.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\u0022I\u0027m shocked, I\u0027m very very shocked, I think all practitioners feel very disappointed with the government. So many people practice Falun Dafa in China and we are all good people, and the government is doing this. And we are very disappointed and shocked and it is time we really need to speak out to the world and tell people what we really are.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Belinda Pang, Falun Gong Member\r\n\r\nThe Hong Kong government has not made any indication that it will follow mainland policy. \r\n\r\nAs part of the mini-constitution put in place after the 1997 handover, Hong Kong\u0027s citizens are guaranteed the same religious freedoms they enjoyed under British rule.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\u0022I\u0027m not worried here because in Hong Kong we have one country, two systems. I trust the government, I trust the system, that we will allow us the freedom of speech, freedom of pursuing our belief, freedom of practising Falun Dafa.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Belinda Pang, Falun Gong Member\r\n\r\nSome Hong Kong Falun Gong followers have claimed that they are being monitored and followed. \r\n\r\nA spokesman said that the number of followers in Hong Kong has dropped by thirty per cent since Beijing outlawed the group on the mainland three months ago.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that there are now about five hundred Falun Gong practitioners in Hong Kong. \r\n\r\nThe group\u0027s faith is a mixture of Buddhism, Taoism, meditation and breathing exercises. \r\n\r\nThe cult claims to have one hundred (m) million followers worldwide.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/eb6617e33eb8e2d33b0f90b2034aff77",

      "description": "(29 Oct 1999) English/Nat\r\n\r\nAbout 100 members of a spiritual sect banned in China have demonstrated outside the U-N headquarters in New York, denouncing Beijing\u0027s crackdown on the group.\r\n\r\nThe protesters denied that the Falun Gong group was \u0022an evil cult\u0022 and asked the Chinese government to stop persecuting the group\u0027s members.\r\n\r\nThe protest came as at least 50 followers were arrested in Beijing, bringing to at least  three-thousand the number of people reportedly detained by the Chinese this week.\r\n\r\nMembers of Falun Gong remain peaceful in the face of adversity. \r\n\r\nBut as the Chinese government detains more and more of the group\u0027s followers, their voices grow stronger. \r\n\r\nOn Friday, practitioners of the spiritual movement, also known as Falun Gong, asked the United Nations, specifically its Secretary General, to intervene in the crisis.\r\n\r\nThe protesters in New York claimed that the human rights of over 100 (m) million Chinese citizens are at risk because they are not allowed to practice their beliefs.\r\n\r\nThe Falun Gong sect blends traditional Qigong exercises with more advanced spiritual meditation, \r\n\r\nThe demonstrators urged the U-N to pressure China to reverse its policies. \r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English) \r\n\u0022And we hope that the U-N can have a peaceful dialogue with the Chinese government and Mr. Li Hongzhi (leader of Falun Gong movement.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Sun Yan, Falun Gong practitioner \r\n\r\nSince the movement was banned by China in July, numerous reports of torture and ill-treatment of its followers were received by human rights organisations. \r\n\r\nThe Chinese government has also burned the numerous books associated with what it calls an \u0022evil sect\u0022.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English) \r\n\u0022What our government is doing is really like the Cultural Revolution. It is using propaganda wars to turn down somebody, so I hope such disaster would not happen again.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Sun Yan, Falun Gong practitioner \r\n\r\nThe head of the movement, Li Hongzhi, has not been seen or heard of since he gave a series of interviews in July when the group was banned.\r\n\r\nHe is reportedly still in the U-S, although spokespeople for the group say his personal safety may be at risk after the Chinese government issued a warrant for his arrest. \r\n\r\nFalun Gong members maintain they are not members of a sect and that they have no political inclinations other than to restore the legality of their movement.\r\n\r\nThe group\u0027s detractors say that Falun Gong is sect-like in that it encourages its members to shun traditional medical help and that they are lead to believe that Li Hongzhi is the reincarnation of Buddha.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/49c47a55583a42fcac3059dba40b6b5e",

      "description": "(22 Jul 1999) English/Nat\r\n\r\nChina on Thursday outlawed the Falun Gong sect, saying it regards the meditation  group as a serious threat to  national stability after three days of cult members  protesting across China.\r\n\r\nHours after the ban was announced, some Hong Kong members of Falun Gong were  vowing to keep practicing, despite what they called a puzzling crackdown by Beijing.\r\n\r\nAbout 60 members of the Falun Gong meditation sect assembled in an apartment in  Hong Kong\u0027s Kowloon district on Thursday evening, to discuss the day\u0027s events.\r\n\r\nChina banned the popular meditation sect on the mainland on Thursday, after three  days of massive protests, intensifying a crackdown on a group Chinese leaders see as  a serious threat to their rule.\r\n\r\nThe ban, reported by state media, accused Falun Gong of spreading \u0022superstitious, evil  thinking\u0022 to undermine social stability.\r\n\r\nBut Falun Gong faces no restrictions in Hong Kong, and members can\u0027t see why  Beijing had a problem on the mainland.\r\n\r\nThe Falun Gong adherents blend martial arts with thought from Buddhism and Taoism. \r\n\r\nBut China\u0027s leaders might see the very size of Falun Gong as a threat.\r\n\r\nIts membership exceeds that of China\u0027s Communist Party.\r\n\r\nBut in Hong Kong these Falun Gong practitioners were keen to stress that the sect had  no political agenda.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\u0022Legal and illegal, good and bad are different, we want to be good, and they call it legal  and illegal. It\u0027s political, we are not ourselves political, so this is different.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Albert Kwok, Falun Gong member\r\n\r\nHe also showed his disbelief at the crackdown.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\u0022I think it is quite unbelievable because what we want is to be a good person. If a good  person is called illegal, there must be something wrong in that place.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Albert Kwok, Falun Gong member\r\n\r\nMany at the Hong Kong meeting sat in a cross-legged yoga position as they chanted  and read aloud from the works of the Falun Gong\u0027s founder, Li Hongzhi. \r\n\r\nLi is a former soldier and government clerk in China, who now lives in the United States.\r\n\r\nSeveral Falun Gong people said there are 40 loosely knit branches in Hong Kong, now  part of China but still enjoying a great deal of autonomy as a so-called \u0022Special  Administrative Region.\u0022\r\n\r\nSome of the members delivered a petition to the Hong Kong offices of China\u0027s official  news agency, Xinhua, on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nBut say Xinhua never responded.\r\n\r\nShortly after speaking to reporters, the members asked to be left alone so they could  continue their chants and discussion privately.\r\n\r\nBut one member of Falun Gong was willing to talk for longer.\r\n\r\nSophie Xiao has relatives in China who are members of Falun Gong and have been  arrested.\r\n\r\nAsked what she thought would happen to them, she said they would be \u0022fine\u0022.\r\n\r\nShe explained that whatever members are told about their beliefs, they still have their  own judgement.\r\n\r\nShe went on to say she hopes the Chinese authorities change their minds on the  banning.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\u0022We still would like our government to rethink their decisions over this, you know,  outlaw of Falun Gong, we would ask them to rethink about it.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Sophie Xiao, member of  Falun Gong\r\n\r\nBut in case this does not happen Falun Gong clearly does not intend letting China\u0027s  latest action pass-by without reacting.\r\n\r\nThe latest message on their website, on Thursday, says that \u0022Urgent action\u0022 is needed  to protect their \u0022principles\u0022, and, \u0022Let\u0027s have an urgent reaction to protect our  principles!\u0022    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/bcc21833b95a242d20daf592d9c7c3fe",
