      "title": "USA: JONESTOWN GUYANA MASSACRE 20 YEARS ON (4)",
      "description": "(18 Nov 1998) English/Nat\r\n\r\nA group of survivors of the Jonestown deaths marked the twentieth anniversary on Tuesday night with a three-hour prayer vigil.\r\n\r\nSurvivors of the tragedy in which 900 people died, remembered their own narrow escapes from the Jonestown sect\u0027s commune and counted their blessings to be alive.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most famous survivor, Deborah Layton - who alerted the world that people were held against their will - is touring the U-S with a new book about the cult.\r\n\r\nIn a church in San Francisco, the survivors\u0027 thank their lucky stars they are alive.\r\n\r\nTheir stories reflect the luck and courage of their escape.\r\n\r\nOne survivor helped a small group escape the commune by telling guards he had organised a picnic.\r\n\r\nJust by chance, he escaped the tragedy that took place in the People\u0027s Temple in Jonestown in the ex-British colony of Guyana.\r\n\r\nThe adopted son of Jim Jones, Jim Jones Jr, escaped death because he and his brother had gone into town to see a basketball game.\r\n\r\nThe younger Jones said it was God who made it possible for him to hug one of the women he had pulled to safety.\r\n\r\nHe said he attended the service to heal old wounds.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\u0022I think, one, is forgiveness, forgiveness for myself for surviving. I think, two, is forgiveness for the failures of Rev Jim Jones, he is not God, he is only a man. And when many people placed him in a God-like role he then believed it. And that\u0027s the tragedy of Jonestown.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: (English) Jim Jones, Jr., Adopted son of Jim Jones\r\n\r\nOne of Jonestown\u0027s most famous survivors is marking the anniversary by touring with a new book about her experience.\r\n\r\nDeborah Layton joined Jim Jones and his People\u0027s Temple after graduating from boarding school at the age of 17.\r\n\r\nAfter more than seven years in the group, Layton followed Jones to Guyana ... and it was there that she began to realise this leader was terribly dangerous.\r\n\r\nIn her recently released autobiography, \u0022Seductive Poison,\u0022 Layton describes the so-called \u0022white nights,\u0022 or weekly suicide drills.\r\n\r\nShe recalled what happened to those who refused to join in.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\u0022A mother, for example, who would say, \u0027No, I don\u0027t want to kill my child, I wont do that\u0027, she as an example to us would be taken from that child and drugged and kept in the medical unit, comatose.  So your choices were, you follow, you act like your part of the team and somehow you hope you can figure a way out.  Those people, you know, in the very end, what seems comforting to people to say these people committed suicide, they didn\u0027t, they were murdered, they died not wanting, they were murdered by Jim Jones.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Deborah Layton, Jonestown Survivor\r\n\r\nLayton managed to escape the guarded compound, leaving her brother and dying mother behind.\r\n\r\nShe says in Jonestown, the sect\u0027s leader became increasingly angry and paranoid following a string of negative press reports.\r\n\r\nAnd she knew his talk of a mass suicide would soon become a reality.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\u0022His paranoia just grew and became just a malignant tumour upon him and he could have let those people live but he wanted to make a point and a statement.  All those good people who joined for the most wonderful reasons, who wanted to be part of something bigger than themselves where used as fodder in the end, so that he could make his point, don\u0027t anyone mess with me.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Deborah Layton, Jonestown Survivor\r\n\r\nAmong the dead were more than 270 children.\r\n\r\nArmed guards shot anyone who refused.\r\n\r\nEven two decades later, the scars from the tragedy are thick and deep.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/8c1b1f7c19986426648e7f1b31d305d7",
