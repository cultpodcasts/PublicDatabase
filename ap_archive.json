SOUNDBITE (English) Ashley Rubright, Epstein abuse survivor: \r\n\u0022To any survivors out there who feel like they don\u0027t matter. It it doesn\u0027t matter if you went once or countless times. We were groomed. We were manipulated. And we were taken advantage of. For decades, survivors have been suffocated by speculation. We\u0027ve been mocked. We\u0027ve been doubted. We\u0027ve been re-traumatized.  while those that hide and seek are what those responsible hide in secrecy. Why don\u0027t we deserve justice? This is not partisan. However, this is very political, as the only path to justice is through our political system. And this is about justice. This is about accountability. This is about protecting the innocence of our children and honoring the dignity of survivors. Everywhere we turn, the story follows us. It\u0027s in headlines, jokes, music, grocery store checkout lines, random conversations that you hear people having in restaurants. For more than 20 years, we\u0027ve been unable to escape it. And every time new promises are made,  our sparks of hope are lit only to be extinguished again. We are tired. However, we are not going away. We will not stop or give up. And we will be on the front lines of this battle. We are no longer scared. And let\u0027s be clear. There were so many enabling adults. Those enablers actively turned a blind eye, and they are the greatest danger.\u0022\r\n\u002BBLACK FRAMES\u002B\u002B\r\n2. SOUNDBITE (English) Haley Robson, Epstein abuse survivor: \r\n\u002B\u002BINCLUDES PAN TO AUDIENCE LISTENING\u002B\u002B\r\n\u0022I prayed for a moment. I prayed for this moment where God which would fill us with reinforcements. I want to acknowledge all the women unfortunately, that couldn\u0027t be here today because I think that is the only list of real great importance. And we should never forget the voices that were not only silenced, but that are not here today. And we should never forget the sacrifices that they made. So today, I would like to take a moment for Virginia (Giuffre), Sky, Danielle (Bensky) and Carolyn. Their voices were just as powerful and they were silence just as much. And for some reason I can feel their spirit, especially Virginia\u0027s today. She would be so proud and she would be so beside herself to see this one moment we have all came together to unite. And for our government and for the politicians who have taken our trauma and have weaponized it against us making it unbearable, making it unlivable, making it hard to move on in a life that we wish to live, in happiness, in joy and peace and justice that can only come from within at this point. And we have gotten to this point. Shame on you. Shame on you for using our trauma to weaponize this moment. We are not going to be fooled by your trickery. We are not going to be fooled by the lies, by the conspiracy theories. We are the keys to this situation. We have the truth. And the FBI knows the truth. The government knows the truth. You may pull this the wool over the sheep\u0027s eyes, but we are the keys. We know who is involved. We know the game. We know the players. And we are sitting here for 20 years waiting for you to get up and do something. Yeah, well guess what? Your time is up, and now we\u0027re doing it.\u0022\r\n\u002B\u002BENDS ON SOUNDBITE\u002B\u002B\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nSurvivors of Jeffrey Epstein\u0027s sexual abuse made their voices heard Wednesday on Capitol Hill, pressuring lawmakers to force the release of the sex trafficking investigation into the late financier and pushing back President Donald Trump\u0027s effort to dismiss the issue as a \u201Choax.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/cc3a33e1116542f48360052d64fa05a6",

But an official investigator told reporters in the picture-postcard Swiss farming community of Cheiry where 23 bodies were found, many clad in coloured cloaks at a secret temple, that two people whom he did not identify were wanted for questioning. Investigator Andre Piller said police could not exclude the possibility that some people involved may have escaped alive, leaving 12 women, 10 men and a 10-year-old child in what he described as a \u0022waxwork museum\u0022 of death. In the Alpine mountainside hamlet of Granges, 160 km (100 miles) south of Cheiry, firemen pulled 25 corpses from the smouldering ruins of two chalets -- some of them children. In Quebec, Canada, police found the bodies of a man and a woman in the smoking ruins of a house in the small community of Morin Heights 80 km (48 miles) north of Montreal. As in Cheiry and Granges, an elaborate fire-starter system involving wires, timers, gas tanks and bags of petroleum had been set up. Police said all three incidents appeared clearly linked to a charismatic 45-year-old doctor, Luc Jouret, who heads a Canadian-based sect known as the \u0022Order of the Solar Temple\u0022 which tells its adherents to prepare for the end of the world. Jouret, a homeopath who has called himself a \u0022new Christ\u0022, owned two of the burned-out chalets in Grange and one of the two houses in Morin Heights. His portrait was also found in a large cellar un der the burned-out barn on the Cheiry farm.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/680e99d2bb1ea9e20eb33b0fd7e8c088",

      "description": "(18 Nov 1998) English/Nat\r\n\r\nA group of survivors of the Jonestown deaths marked the twentieth anniversary on Tuesday night with a three-hour prayer vigil.\r\n\r\nSurvivors of the tragedy in which 900 people died, remembered their own narrow escapes from the Jonestown sect\u0027s commune and counted their blessings to be alive.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most famous survivor, Deborah Layton - who alerted the world that people were held against their will - is touring the U-S with a new book about the cult.\r\n\r\nIn a church in San Francisco, the survivors\u0027 thank their lucky stars they are alive.\r\n\r\nTheir stories reflect the luck and courage of their escape.\r\n\r\nOne survivor helped a small group escape the commune by telling guards he had organised a picnic.\r\n\r\nJust by chance, he escaped the tragedy that took place in the People\u0027s Temple in Jonestown in the ex-British colony of Guyana.\r\n\r\nThe adopted son of Jim Jones, Jim Jones Jr, escaped death because he and his brother had gone into town to see a basketball game.\r\n\r\nThe younger Jones said it was God who made it possible for him to hug one of the women he had pulled to safety.\r\n\r\nHe said he attended the service to heal old wounds.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\u0022I think, one, is forgiveness, forgiveness for myself for surviving. I think, two, is forgiveness for the failures of Rev Jim Jones, he is not God, he is only a man. And when many people placed him in a God-like role he then believed it. And that\u0027s the tragedy of Jonestown.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: (English) Jim Jones, Jr., Adopted son of Jim Jones\r\n\r\nOne of Jonestown\u0027s most famous survivors is marking the anniversary by touring with a new book about her experience.\r\n\r\nDeborah Layton joined Jim Jones and his People\u0027s Temple after graduating from boarding school at the age of 17.\r\n\r\nAfter more than seven years in the group, Layton followed Jones to Guyana ... and it was there that she began to realise this leader was terribly dangerous.\r\n\r\nIn her recently released autobiography, \u0022Seductive Poison,\u0022 Layton describes the so-called \u0022white nights,\u0022 or weekly suicide drills.\r\n\r\nShe recalled what happened to those who refused to join in.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\u0022A mother, for example, who would say, \u0027No, I don\u0027t want to kill my child, I wont do that\u0027, she as an example to us would be taken from that child and drugged and kept in the medical unit, comatose.  So your choices were, you follow, you act like your part of the team and somehow you hope you can figure a way out.  Those people, you know, in the very end, what seems comforting to people to say these people committed suicide, they didn\u0027t, they were murdered, they died not wanting, they were murdered by Jim Jones.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Deborah Layton, Jonestown Survivor\r\n\r\nLayton managed to escape the guarded compound, leaving her brother and dying mother behind.\r\n\r\nShe says in Jonestown, the sect\u0027s leader became increasingly angry and paranoid following a string of negative press reports.\r\n\r\nAnd she knew his talk of a mass suicide would soon become a reality.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\u0022His paranoia just grew and became just a malignant tumour upon him and he could have let those people live but he wanted to make a point and a statement.  All those good people who joined for the most wonderful reasons, who wanted to be part of something bigger than themselves where used as fodder in the end, so that he could make his point, don\u0027t anyone mess with me.\u0022\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Deborah Layton, Jonestown Survivor\r\n\r\nAmong the dead were more than 270 children.\r\n\r\nArmed guards shot anyone who refused.\r\n\r\nEven two decades later, the scars from the tragedy are thick and deep.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200B\u200B\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/8c1b1f7c19986426648e7f1b31d305d7",
