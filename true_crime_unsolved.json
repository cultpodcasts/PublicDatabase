      "description": "In this in-depth interview, True Crime Unsolved speaks with Kent Burtner, a former Catholic priest and longtime counselor who specializes in helping people recover from involvement in high-control groups\u2014commonly known as cults.\n\nKent has worked with many former members of the Movement Center, a spiritual organization connected to allegations of manipulation, coercive control, drug abuse, and sexual exploitation. Drawing on decades of experience, he explains how charismatic leaders gain power, how belief systems are weaponized, and why intelligent, well-meaning people can become trapped inside destructive groups.\n\nThis conversation also provides crucial context for the death of Ayaz Qadir and the ongoing search for answers by his sister, Saba Qadir. While law enforcement considers the case closed, serious questions remain about the environment Ayaz was placed into and whether the group tasked with his care failed him.\n\n\u26A0\uFE0F Important Note:\nThis episode presents the experiences and opinions of our guest.

      "title": "The Movement Center: Cult Allegations, Control, and a Death That Raises Questions",
      "description": "For decades, The Movement Center, a spiritual organization led by Michael Shoemaker (also known as Swami Chaitananda), has been the subject of controversy, allegations, and lawsuits. In this episode of True Crime Unsolved, we examine publicly reported claims surrounding the group \u2014 including allegations of coercive control, sexual misconduct, exploitation of members, and abuse of spiritual authority.\n\nDrawing from court filings, investigative journalism, and firsthand accounts, we trace the group\u2019s origins, its leadership structure, and how a small yoga-based spiritual movement allegedly evolved into a high-control environment. We also explore reporting by a Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning journalist, testimony from former members, and the troubling patterns that emerge across multiple accounts \n\nThis episode also sets the stage for a deeper investigation into the death of Ayaz Qadir, a young man who died from a heroin overdose while staying at the Movement Center \u2014 a death ruled accidental, but one his family believes deserves renewed scrutiny.\n\n\u26A0\uFE0F Important Note:\nAll allegations discussed are sourced from publicly available reporting and legal filings. They are presented as allegations, not proven facts. Individuals mentioned are presumed innocent unless proven otherwise in a court of law. Our goal is to examine documented claims and unresolved questions \u2014 not to reach legal conclusions.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in stories involving cult dynamics, coercive control, spiritual abuse, and unsolved or disputed deaths, this is a case worth understanding.\n\n\uD83C\uDFA7 Prefer audio?
