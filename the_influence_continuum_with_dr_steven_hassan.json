      "description": "Elon Musk, a corporate billionaire and private naturalized American citizen born in South Africa, has taken an extraordinary amount of power in government since Donald Trump took office as President less than a month ago. Musk is seeking to interfere with elections in Germany and other countries around the world. Vance recently told European leaders to allow more \u201Cfree speech\u201D but what that means is use of social media and media to push authoritarianism. Dr. Stuart Shulman holds a PhD in American Politics and has done extensive teaching and leadership roles in collaborative interdisciplinary research. Additionally, as founder and CEO of Texifter, he discussed the analysis of Twitter data, his work supporting academic access to data, and federal agency review of public comments on proposed rules. Stuart and I discussed how Twitter was gamified through QAnon since 2017. He tracked QAnon, a tale of a high-up government official with a \u201CQ-level\u201D clearance covering nuclear weapons and related materials and tweeting about supposed confidential information. Coded language and \u201Ccrumbs\u201D were then created to entice signaling, and Trump often alluded to this through tweets. Stuart noted that in a December 1-12, 2017, dataset with 2.3 million mentions of Michael Flynn, \u201C#followthewhiterabbit\u201D and \u201Cthe Great Awakening\u201D and other QAnon buzzwords in the Tweets. Stuart noted how the Alternate Reality Gaming (ARG) characters often have made-up names and emojis and could have come from anywhere in the world, including Russia, China, India, and other nations that may not have the best interests of voters and citizens in western democracies.

He is an Iraq combat veteran, accomplished public policy advocate, nonprofit leader, and expert on the threats posed by domestic extremist organizations that work against Democracy. His group focuses on gathering intelligence on dangerous individuals and hate groups while also teaching the skills and context necessary to keep veterans and communities safe. Like me, Kris couldn\u2019t believe Trump gave pardons to the violent #Jan6th insurrectionists serving time in jail for their crimes against America. We both believe we are in World War III and fighting fascism at home. Musk, Thiel and other billionaires are on the record that they dont believe in democracy of upholding the Constitution nor do they want to help the USA remain a superpower. They are busy with NeoTech conspiracy to take over the world and dismante our administrative state using the Heritage Foundation\u2019s 2025 playbook. Kris is a patriot and has inspired many vets to step up with him to oppose what is being done to us.

      "description": "This interview had two foci: ISKCON and Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s Connection to Krishna Hinduism and his new academic book on music and its role in psychedelics states. Gelberg was a Krishna devotee for 17 years and has written about his experiences with the cult and why he exited. He is now a successful photographer and author. We discussed the more recent finding that Tulsi Gabbard, nominated by Trump to be Director of National Intelligence, shows ties to Krishna Hinduism and ISKCON. Chris Butler, who is the guru of Tulsi Gabbard, was a disciple of the Krishna movement and Prabhupada. The group is known for its homophobia. \u201CThe Krishna movement also is very misogynistic. They try to hide that. They don\u2019t like talking about it. They know it\u0027s not popular, but if you go to Prabhupada\u0027s books, he repeats what he learned from the Hindu tradition about women being lesser and needing to be always under the control of a man and less spiritually adept than men are\u201D Steven said. He then expressed concerns about ties with this organization and what that may mean by Gabbard\u2019s beliefs around these topics. In addition to his spiritual and academic education after leaving the cult, Gelberg continued to tune into an evolving \u201CPsychedelic Renaissance\u201D as the government began to loosen regulations allowing for legitimate clinical studies and inspiring the creation, by growing numbers of colleges and universities, of programs and centers for the study of psychedelics and their therapeutic effects.\n\nLearn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

      "description": "Ever hear the term coercive control? Did you know the UK government made it a crime? It is the application of undue influence methods and techniques used by a person, typically a man against a partner to do what I have been calling mind control- as in my BITE Model. However, women especially need to know what the techniques are and how to navigate a family court system in the USA which is largely ignorant and children and women are being greatly harmed. Dr. Cocchiola holds a doctorate in social work, is a licensed clinical social worker, is a tenured college professor, and is an expert in coercive control as is Amy Polacko, an award-winning journalist and investigative reporter, and divorce coach.Their excellent book is a resource for women going through divorce, married women noticing early warning signs, and those considering marriage, offering practical advice and raising awareness of systemic challenges.Despite persistent myths that women are more often favored, family courts can be gender-biased, and some women who report abuse encounter even harsher outcomes. The authors aim to inspire reform in family court practices and contribute to future legislative efforts to protect women from abusive legal dynamics.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "\u0022Conversion therapy\u0022\u2014a discredited practice that purports to change an individual\u0027s sexual orientation and/or gender identification and expression\u2014has harmed countless lives under the guise of morality. I spoke to Lucas Wilson, an SSHRC Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Toronto Mississauga, as he shared his harrowing experience with \u0022conversion therapy\u0022 at Liberty University. His story serves as a testament to the perseverance of the unique human spirit and a warning against the devastating impacts of undue influence. A scholar, editor, and advocate, Wilson\u0027s work sheds light on the intersections of evangelicalism, homophobia, and trauma. He is the editor of the forthcoming Shame-Sex Attraction: Survivors\u0027 Stories of Conversion Therapy, which compiles narratives from 17 contributors, offering diverse perspectives on a practice that major medical, psychiatric, and psychological organizations have condemned. A recent Canadian study cited by Wilson underscores the two most impactful ways to support survivors of \u0022conversion therapy\u0022: listening without judgment and reconnecting with affirming communities. Survivors benefit immensely from being heard and validated. Listening affirms their experiences and begins the process of rebuilding trust. Additionally, reconnecting with a supportive queer community provides a safe space for healing and affirmation, countering the isolation imposed by conversion practices. Wilson\u0027s story is not just about survival but also about transformation. It highlights the dangers of unhealthy influence while demonstrating the power of education, community, and self-acceptance. As conversations around \u0022conversion therapy\u0022 and undue influence continue, stories like Wilson\u0027s remind us of the urgent need for advocacy and awareness. Together, we can create a world where everyone can live authentically without fear or shame.\n\nLearn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

      "description": "Dustin Rozario Steinhagen, PhD is a privacy expert who recently graduated with his doctorate degree in Cyber Defense from Dakota State University. His dissertation is titled \u201CDefending the security of the mind: A mail survey of thought-reform literacy in South Dakota.\u201D This quantitative analysis measured \u201Cwhat everyday people know about thought reform and psychologically manipulative groups.\u201D One of the most powerful defenses a person can have against mind hacking is admitting they are vulnerable to it. After that, skills can be acquired and built upon to teach people how to protect themselves further. However, we mustn\u2019t let our guard down when it comes to our brains and minds coming under attack. Like anti-virus software needing updates to protect against the latest cyber threats, our minds also require ongoing learning to maintain psychological security in addition to adequate rest, play, and sleep. Influences are also more challenging to detect, more frequent in occurrence, from multiple directions, and require vigilance when interacting with different levels of trusted or untrusted sources. Having trusted groups who respect personal privacy and have our best intentions in mind becomes extremely important in such an environment. Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "Australian Maria Esguerra tells us that it\u2019s still difficult to speak about her personal experiences as a second-generation survivor of The Children of God cult. In this episode of The Influence Continuum, we explored the challenges of breaking free from cults and how those who become part of society\u2019s natural defense system against cult indoctrination and authoritarianism help to free others. She traced her story back to a childhood of illnesses that mainly went untreated. \u201CI had measles, chicken pox, mumps, malaria, every imaginable childhood disease, lots of parasites,\u201D she said. Her father would eventually die when she was only four years old from Hodgkin Lymphoma, a form of cancer considered to be largely curable. She explained that in The Children of God cult, medical care was avoided as illnesses were considered the fault of the person or as \u201CGod judging you.\u201D Maria is now a psychologist and Director of Assessable, an organization dedicated to serving people with disabilities. This is an especially commendable achievement in that her early life was shaped by her parent\u2019s involvement in The Children of God cult. We discussed the experience of raising children within the cult and what ultimately pushed Maria to leave. One of the critical factors in her decision was her son\u2019s battle with meningitis, which left him in a coma at a medical research center for ten days, resulting in a lifelong brain injury. While in Africa, Maria became pregnant again and endured harsh conditions. Upon returning to Australia, she resolved to create a new reality for her children\u2014one rooted in safety and love, something she had not been given. Maria is an inspiration for everyone!

      "description": "On this episode of the Influence Continuum, I spoke with Craig Unger, an investigative journalist and the author of Den of Spies, which is described in his biography as \u201Ca real-life political thriller about how master spy William Casey put together a treasonous covert operation in 1980 that hijacked American foreign policy and stole the election for Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush.\u201D Craig is also the author of six books on the Republican party\u2019s assault on democracy, including American Kompromat: How the KGB Cultivated Donald Trump and Related Tales of Sex, Greed, Power, and Treachery. He has written for New York Magazine, The New Republic, The Washington Post, The Guardian, The New Yorker, The New York Times, Esquire, The Independent, and many others. \u201CInitially, I think, it was very covert, as I show in this book. Everything was behind the scenes. With Trump today, it\u2019s almost overt,\u201D Craig said, noting Trump\u2019s direct message in 2016 to Russia to retrieve Clinton\u2019s emails. I noted The Wall Street Journal\u2019s recent article citing Elon Musk\u2019s relationship with Vladimir Putin and secret conversations. We then discussed the volumes of evidence supporting the idea that Trump was recruited as an asset for the KGB in the 1980s. This book is a well researched documented revealing of how American Democracy has been manipulated. Tragic and Americans wil now see what is brought to power.

      "description": "Dr Phil spoke at Madison Square Garden saying Trump wasnt a bully. Ha! Professor Yamada is an internationally recognized authority on workplace bullying. He is a professor of law and the director of the New Workplace Institute at Suffolk University Law School in Boston. It is the primary drafter of model workplace anti-bullying legislation known as the Healthy Workplace Bill, which is serving as a template for law reform efforts in the U.S. He also is the founding board chairperson of the International Society for Therapeutic Jurisprudence, which promotes the application and design of laws, legal procedures, and legal institutions that support psychological health and well-being. Professor Yamada identifies former President Donald Trump as being a classic workplace bully, constantly resorting to ridicule, name-calling, and cruel putdowns in his public and private behavior. These actions are consistent with some of the worst types of workplace bullying. Drawing from the DSM-V, Trump\u2019s behaviors are often called \u201Ccluster B\u201D traits or behaviors. Cluster B includes narcissism, sociopathy, emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and attention-seeking. It is no wonder that 40 out of 44 former insiders from the Trump White House have now come out in favor of Kamala Harris. The idea of well-being is central to Professor Yamada\u2019s work and the backbone of our discussion in this episode. Professor Yamada\u2019s current work examines how the law, public policy, and dispute resolution procedures can be designed to be more trauma-informed, enhancing the well-being of those impacted by law and public policies. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oAmU7E1zaycPovorrPQ4JJmBtwl_RgRy/view?usp=drive_link Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "When thinking about political leaders\u2014those with influence over national or global issues\u2014how often do we consider the role of their political followers? Could you or I say \u201Cno\u201D to a toxic leader and courageously defy their commands? This consideration is critical. Leaders don\u2019t operate in isolation. They need political followers who support, amplify, and even challenge their actions. These checks and balances support strong, fair leadership and ensure the political process is just. To Stop a Tyrant is a book approved of by readers at both ends of the political spectrum as it is a non-partisan and evergreen topic. In my interview with Ira Chaleff, author of The Courageous Follower and Intelligent Disobedience: Doing Right When What You\u2019re Told to Do Is Wrong, we explored this multifaceted relationship as he explained how political followers have the power to support healthy leadership or enable authoritarianism. His fascinating perspective comes from a dedicated career of studying the dynamics of leadership and followership \u2013 specifically in political contexts. Together, we unpacked his insights on what he calls \u201CCourageous Followership,\u201D his perspectives on intelligently and ethically disobeying harmful instructions from a leader, and the roles of followers who have the power to combat undue influence.

      "description": "Pornhub was once recognized as the largest and most popular porn site in the world. The site made it easy for users to upload and download content, which is desirable in other contexts. However, these features pose significant threats when applied to freely accessible user-generated, homemade, pornography. Reports suggest that without adequate safeguards, there was a rapid increase in uploads of questionable, illegal, and violent content, including instances of nonconsensual sexual acts. More troublingly, such content became widely viewable and could be downloaded onto private devices. Laila Mickelwait is the author of the new book Takedown: Inside the Fight to Shut Down Pornhub for Child Abuse, Rape, and Sex Trafficking. She is also the founder and CEO of the Justice Defense Fund, a non-profit organization that seeks to help bring justice to survivors of online sexual crimes. Numerous lawsuits have been filed based on sex trafficking, child abuse, and RICO laws in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., with claims that Visa and two hedge funds also knowingly profited from content depicting sexual abuse.

      "description": "In this powerful speech, delivered on September 27th, 2024, Dr. Steven Hassan addresses a gathering of mental health professionals in Washington, D.C., warning the public about the dangerous mental state of Donald Trump. Drawing from his personal experience as a former member of the Moonies cult, Dr. Hassan emphasizes the importance of understanding brainwashing, mind control, and cult behavior. He highlights the dissociative disorder that afflicts Trump and his followers, based on his decades of research and the influence of his mentor, Robert J. Lifton.\n\nDr. Hassan calls for massive psychoeducation and interventions to help those under unethical influence who are trapped in the MAGA cult. He exposes the authoritarian groups controlling Trump, such as Opus Dei and the New Apostolic Reformation, and explains how their manipulation of information leads to mind control. His message urges us to destigmatize and create off-ramps for those caught in these destructive belief systems.\n\nThis speech is a must-watch for anyone concerned about the psychological manipulation at play in politics today.

      "title": "Who Owns Democracy? The Real Deep State and The Struggle Over Class and Caste with Sociologist Charles Derber, PhD",
      "description": "United States history is often portrayed more through myth than historical fact. The true story of America, from its founding rebellion to the present day, is extraordinarily complex. The truth can sometimes seem almost unimaginable due to the numerous injustices and inequities throughout its history. Despite the ideals expressed by the nation\u2019s founders in the Preamble to the Constitution\u2014to form \u201Ca more perfect Union,\u201D establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure liberty for future generations\u2014America\u2019s creation was rooted in systems of class and caste. As discussed in this episode of the Influence Continuum, the idea of a fair system initially created to be accessible to all is an aspect of that founding myth. Charles Derber, a Professor of Sociology at Boston College and life-long activist has authored 28 books on topics such as politics, democracy, fascism, corporations, capitalism, climate change, war, culture wars, and social change. In this episode of the Influence Continuum, he helped us delve deeper into the historical dynamics of class and caste. His latest book, co-authored with Yale R. Magrass, Who Owns Democracy? The Real Deep State and the Struggle Over Class and Caste in America presents a candid discussion about the hard truths of power and who predominantly bears the burden or responsibility of the deep state.

He asked me to speak on the MAGA cult in his new film, #UNTRUTH: The Psychology of Trumpism, which will be streaming on virtually every platform. Dan\u2019s new film highlights what I have been saying for years\u2014Trumpism is not just a political movement; it operates as a destructive authoritarian cult and utilizes known mind-control techniques to disconnect Trump\u2019s followers from reality, reinforce their loyalty to him, and silence dissenters and dissidents. In 2020, he released a film, #UNFIT: The Psychology of Donald Trump, during the 2020 election cycle.

      "description": "Have you ever learned from an expert in coercive control? Ever thought about the authoritarianism in a family structure? Maybe you or someone you know were married to a narcissist or knows of children being manipulated by an abusive parent. My latest guest, social worker Christine Cocchiola, is an expert on adult and child victims of coercive control. Dr. Christine Cocchiola has a doctorate in Social Welfare, is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, and is a tenured Social Work professor. Dr. Cocchiola also has a brand-new book with co-author Amy Polacko called Framed: Women in the Family Court Underworld. It consists of 22 stories from survivors of coercive control and narcissistic abuse and what it was like for them and their families dealing with the legal system. Dr. Cocchiola\u0027s work helps combat what I think is an unrealized epidemic, which is people who are harmful and toxic to others. During our talk, we focused on what I believe is vitally important in understanding authoritarian and coercive control when a parent acts like a cult leader.

      "description": "When Kamala Harris was Attorney General for California she supported legislation to protect elderly people from undue influence. In this installment of The Influence Continuum, I sat down with Lisa Nerenberg, MSW, MPH, who has dedicated her career to ensuring dignity and justice for this vulnerable and growing population. Lisa is the founding executive director of The California Elder Justice Coalition. She now serves as the organization\u2019s Director of Special Projects. She co-founded the San Francisco Consortium for Elder Abuse Prevention and the National Network for State Elder Justice Coalitions. Showcasing her passion and expertise, Lisa has authored two influential books: Elder Justice, Ageism, and Elder Abuse (2019) and Elder Abuse Prevention (2008). I believe that undue influence has reached a \u201Ctipping point\u201D where most Americans agree that people can be harmed by psychological means.

I spoke with Walt McKee and J. Larry Mayes, who co-chair the Braver Angels Trustworthy Elections Leadership Team, an organization I am also proud to be a member of. Braver Angels is a unique nonprofit, as it is one of the few organizations that actively brings people together from both sides of the aisle to listen to each other and develop friendships- whether they lean red or lean blue. This year they decided to do a project to determine what everyone could agree on as a fair and trustworthy election. The summary, available to all on the Braver Angels\u0027 website, is reported to consist of \u002223 specific solutions which address seven broad areas of concern,\u0022 including: Fair and Equal Access to Voting Verifiable Voter Identity and Eligibility Transparency and Accountability Redistricting \u2013 Gerrymandering Confidence in Vote Counting Safety and Security in the Elections Process Peaceful Transfer of Power Please come learn about how these recommendations were developed and agreed to by all who lean left or lean right as a way to find common ground together.

Vance as his vice president, and the pair continue to get increasingly \u201Cweird,\u201D and lying seems to be ramping up if that is even possible. Conservative attorney George Conway has created the Anti-Psychopath PAC and has publicly called out the media\u2019s failure to explain the dangers of having a psychopath in the White House. Conway wrote the Foreword to the rerelease of The Cult of Trump which is being rolled out asap. We did an Afterword. I wanted to reshare this 2023 interview with one of the leading experts who has been silenced is Bandy X. Lee, M.D., M.Div., a forensic psychiatrist, president of the World Mental Health Coalition, and an internationally recognized expert on violence. A brilliant and compassionate observer of the political landscape, she is the author of Profile of a Nation: Trump\u2019s Mind, America\u2019s Soul and editor of the best-selling book The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 37 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President. She is assembling a team of authors to create a new, short book published by the World Mental Health Coalition and tentatively titled The More Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 37 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Warn Anew.

It features Dr. James Scaminaci\u2019s expertise on psychological warfare and specifically something called Fourth Generation Warfare (4GW). Understanding psychological warfare is imperative to counter the authoritarian agenda aimed at destabilizing people\u2019s sense of self and understanding of \u201Creality.\u201D Indeed, social media and AI are being used to confuse, disorient, and unduly influence people to extremely simplistic positions of all or nothing and good versus evil. The moderate majority that values facts, science, human rights, and checks and balances of power must stay focused on reality being very complex and rarely simple. Going forward, we must understand and protect ourselves in order to keep American from coming apart. Come join us on this fascinating interview.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

He has managed to enthrall millions to think God is on Trump\u2019s side. All I can say is that no one has experienced more directly the weaponization of the DOJ using former AG William Barr, than Michael Cohen. His book Revenge: How Donald Trump Weaponized the Department of Justice Against His Critics. So I decided to reair our 2023 interview when the book first came out to put some \u201Cflesh on the bones\u201D of this attack on our constitution and rule of law. Michael Cohen hosts the Mea Culpa podcast and authored the #1 best-selling book, Disloyal: A Memoir. His book Revenge is an indictment of Trump weaponizing the Department of Justice, headed by AG Bill Barr. Putting Cohen in jail- solitary confinement for 51 days!

Her insights reveal the critical intersection between human trafficking and mind control, similar to the techniques employed by cult leaders. Empowered Network assists survivors of human trafficking in moving beyond immediate crisis services to achieve long-term stability. I was honored to nominate Felicia Rosario, MD, to get support from the Empowered Network. Felicia was in the Larry Ray cult at Sarah Lawrence that was featured in the Hulu series Stolen Youth. I appeared in the fourth episode, listed under ABC Nightline-Impact Stolen Youth; in that episode, I met Felicia and Daniel Levin, the cult\u2019s whistleblower, and talked with them about their experiences. Larry Ray was convicted of trafficking and is in jail for the rest of his life. I am happy to say Felicia is returning to become a forensic psychiatrist and will attend the IALMH.org congress with me this July 22-26th in Barcelona.

      "description": "Humans crave connection. This need for connection is a vital aspect of the psychology behind cults, coercion, and undue influence. Isolation makes people vulnerable and fearful and more likely to be influenced in harmful ways. Psychiatrist Ravi Chandra discusses the psychology of connection, how institutions can take action to encourage empathy and critical thinking, and how social media and fear-mongering news cycles are creating divisions. We need to be focusing on developing trust and community. As a member of the American Psychiatric Association, Ravi Chandra is concerned about the Goldwater Rule and how it limits what psychiatrists can and cannot say about public figures Like Donald Trump. The APA established the Goldwater rule in 1973. The so-called \u201Crule\u201D says that psychiatrists should not diagnose a person from a distance; they should only offer professional opinions if they have done a personal examination and evaluation. However, forensic experts on dangerousness, like Dr. Bandy X. Lee insists \u201Cexperts have a duty to warn!\u201D When their voices are censored we are all endangered.

They are out on street corners, travel terminals in pairs. When I heard about a new book in Portuguese by a former elder, I wanted to learn more. Ant\u00F3nio\u0027s new book, The Universe of Destructive Sects \u2013 Discover the secret world of deception, manipulation and mind control, explores the deepest secrets of the human mind and uncovers the manipulative techniques behind cults and high-control groups. Ant\u00F3nio Madaleno\u2019s journey from a dedicated Jehovah\u2019s Witness elder to a vocal advocate against the Watchtower Society\u2019s control tactics is a powerful story of courage and resilience.

      "description": "For those who know Combating Cult Mind Control and my work, you know I was in the Moon cult. However, if you are under 50 years old, most people have no idea what the Moonies are about. Allen Tate Wood was a four-year member of the Unification Church\u2013aka The Moon organization. He was the Chief Political Officer of the Unification Church in the United States, commander for the state of Maryland, workshop Director and Chief lecturer for the state of Maryland, and an expert witness for the congressional subcommittee investigation led by Donald Fraser into the Korean CIA infiltration into the United States. He also authored Moonstruck: a memoir of my life and a cult to warn people against cult dangers. Wood said he left in 1973 because \u201Cthey were making people into fanatics.\u201D In addition, he testified in The London Daily Mail lawsuit where the newspaper wrote that the Moonies brainwashed members and separated them from their families. The Daily Mail won the case and the Unification Church had to pay some 2 million dollars. Perhaps most importantly, Wood testified before the US Supreme Court in 1979 and 1981in the case involving Moon\u2019s conviction of conspiracy to defraud the US Government. Mr. Moon was sentenced to 18 months and served 13 in a posh prison in Danbury, Connecticut. Mr. Moon died in 2012, and two sons fight with their mother over billions of dollars. Sean Moon claims to be \u201Cking\u201D and has created a religious cult called the Rod of Iron Ministries. He claims that God wants people to own and know how to use AR-15 assault rifles. Sean Moon went to the January 6th coup attempt at the Capitol and tweeted that Antifa was making the attack- a lie also pushed by Moon\u2019s newspaper, The Washington Times. His brother Justin Moon owns a gun factory in Pennsylvania to make assault rifles and train people for civil wars. After Biden\u2019s inauguration as President of the United States, his predecessor Moon went to the January 6th coup attempt at the Capitol and tweeted that Antifa was making the attack- a lie also pushed by Moon\u2019s newspaper, The Washington Times. Trump, Pence, and Pompeo all appeared for a virtual event for Hak Ja Han, endorsing her. Trump received 2.5 million dollars for this. This was just a few weeks after the attempted violent coup. The Washington Times has been the center of 50 years of climate science denial according to David Lipsky. Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",

Jon and I have been friends and colleagues He is the author of Let\u2019s Sell These People A Piece of Blue Sky, considered the definitive book on Scientology, Dianetics, and L. Ron Hubbard. During our podcast, we discussed the new audiobook versions of Scientology: The Cult of Greed and Opening Our Minds: Avoiding Abusive Relationships and Authoritarian Groups. A significant portion of our discussion focused on the struggle former cult members face in processing the mind control they endured. We consider ourselves \u201Celders\u201D in the work helping people to understand and recover. Yet we both are frustrated that former members fail to see \u201Cthe big picture\u201D and continue to operate out of a cult mindset of \u201Cus vs. them\u201D- even when it comes to fellow ex Scientologists. There is a lot of interesting things we unpack, including the fact that the founder of the cult was a hypnotist. Our conversation delved deeply into the complexities of mind control, the importance of processing and healing from cult experiences, and the challenges former members face in reclaiming their lives.

He stated, \u201CMore people need to know that those who are discriminated against [sometimes] become those who discriminate.\u201D In psychology, we call this the victim, victimizer paradigm. It is the idea that without healthy self-reflection, people exteriorize or project their own inner \u201Cdemons\u201D onto others. This cycle of religiously motivated harm is a concern for both individuals and society: \u201COne of the concerns that I have...is that we\u2019re seeing more and more taxpayer-supported religious schools in the United States, particularly at the K through 12 levels,\u201D said Jonathon\u2014\u201C\u2026[and] adolescents, young people, and children are especially susceptible to some of the most...harmful aspects of radical religion.\u201D He is the author of the important journal article titled (Un)hidden from self: on LGBTQ students and the conspiratorial demonology of the New Apostolic Reformation.

      "description": "Mike tried to escape Scientology\u2019s undue influence when he was 15. As punishment for trying to escape, he was isolated, sleep-deprived, and forced to do hard labor for over a year and a half. Mike reflects that he felt like a prisoner during this time. Mike finally escaped Scientology at age 27 and joined the military. He had little education and no credit history. Despite these odds, he was inspired by his family\u2019s previous military service and flourished in the Army. Mike became a helicopter pilot and instructor. Mike served five combat tours between Iraq and Afghanistan in his nearly 20 years of service. Mike\u2019s parents joined Scientology when he was seven. Later he says he was made to join the Sea Organization or \u201CSea Org,\u201D a paramilitary section of Scientology. Mike\u2019s mom, Rosemary, worked directly for one of Scientology\u2019s top executives, Ronnie Miscavige Jr., older brother of the organization\u2019s leader, David Miscavige. Mike reflects that the military was less controlling than Scientology for him. Later, Mike rescued his mother from the cult. An utterly fascinating story.

      "description": "Rev. Dr. Todd F. Eklof has been the minister of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Spokane, WA, since 2011. He\u2019s appreciated for his mind-altering sermons, compassionate soul, and social activism. Unitarianism and Unitarian Universalism have traditionally been known as liberal religions, defined by their commitment to individual dignity and freedom of expression. They promote diversity and inclusivity and encourage their members to engage in the \u201Cfree and responsible search for truth and meaning.\u201D However, Todd has had a different experience. He believes the organization has undergone a significant policy change, with the value of autonomy and freedom of expression becoming less valued. As a minister, he was not allowed to discuss his concerns openly and was attacked when he did speak out. As a result, he was \u201Cdisfellowshipped.\u201D Eklof been widely appreciated for his environmental and gay rights activism, in addition to engaging in the areas of criminal justice reform, restorative justice, the peace movement, as well as immigration and racial justice. I wanted to interview him to highight just how polarized Americans have become. I was shocked to hear that he was \u201Ccanceled.\u201D Cancel culture is just not ok- on the right or the left.

      "description": "My guest on this episode of The Influence Continuum is Pamela Ryckman, who wrote the book Candace Pert: Genius, Greed, and Madness in the World of Science. Science and health institutions can mimic cult-like behaviors and dysfunctional systems when the structures within them become overly competitive and focused on limited resources to obtain professional goals. Ideals of collaboration for the good of the public can become crushed under systems of harmful competition and dogmatic attachments to old-fashioned ideas. The life story of Candace Pert, who discovered the opioid receptor, is a clear demonstration of how women and minorities have often been undermined, excluded, or driven out of that system. Virtually unheard of by most, her life work included significant discoveries in mind-body medicine, HIV treatments with Peptide T, and volumes of scientific research and publishing over her time working within the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Mental Health. Pamela Ryckman is an Emmy-winning producer and writer focusing on women in the workforce. She noted how the story of Candace Pert\u2019s life work provided an ideal launchpad to discuss some of the most pressing issues plaguing science and healthcare today. Ryckman is also the author of the book Stiletto Network: Inside the Women\u2019s Power Circles That Are Changing the Face of Business, which discusses the secret society of the world\u2019s most powerful women shaping an underground movement for change. She has written for The New York Times, Financial Times, Washington Post, and many other publications. Join me for this utterly fascinating discussion.

      "description": "Empowering patients or clients to have authority and control over their medical experiences is vital to beneficial therapeutic care. Likewise, well-crafted use of professional communication skills in setting expectations about clinical procedures and outcomes can mean the difference between a traumatic medical visit versus one being remembered with gratitude. Clinical studies show that clinicians trained in hypnotic skills can effectively help patients be more receptive to well-placed suggestions that may help reduce discomfort, eliminate the need for certain medications, lessen the side effects of treatments, and offer moderation over anxiety. Dr. Elvira Lang-Anderson, MD, PhD, is an award-winning interventional radiologist and founder of Comfort Talk\u00AE. This skills-based program fosters improvement of patient satisfaction, optimizing outcomes, and the ability to complete medical procedures through rapid rapport and \u0022word choice\u0022 techniques. She has studied patient/provider interactions and their impact on health outcomes, staff satisfaction, and the results of different techniques on the overall efficiency of healthcare systems.

We first met in the early 90s when he contacted me after reading Combating Cult Mind Control. My book helped him understand how he had been manipulated in the cult using primary BITE model tactics. I have been on his podcast, Deceived, about his experience in the Chung Moo Quan cult. He also has a soon-to-be-published memoir called Deceived: A Journey into Darkness. I have heard from countless people about their involvement in destructive martial arts groups over the years. Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",

      "description": "\u201CAmerica right now needs some exit ramps,\u201D Jason Van Tatenhove said as we discussed his former role as national media director for the Oath Keepers, a group known for its far-right anti-government militia. While Jason would ultimately decide to leave the group in 2016 due to increasing racism and Holocaust denial within their membership, the Oath Keepers would go on to participate in the United States Capitol January 6th attack, led by followers of Donald Trump. Jason eventually testified before a U.S. House Select Committee about his position in media propaganda for the organization. He described their attempts at paramilitary tactics, plans for insurrection, and his relationship with Stewart Rhodes, founder of the Oath Keepers, convicted of seditious conspiracy and evidence tampering. Jason publicly speaks about his concerns for continued paramilitary training groups and recruitment tactics in future election cycles, including the 2024 presidential race. His book, The Perils of Extremism: How I Left the Oath Keepers and Why We Should Be Concerned about a Future Civil War, discusses the unsettled state surrounding extremism in America today and provides an insider view into the tactics used to recruit, train, and further radicalize persons with former military backgrounds, first-responders, and individuals who may otherwise feel disenfranchised by United States Democracy at this time.

My guest is the lead editor of a comprehensive textbook on clinical hypnosis. Still, it also includes two chapters I co-authored with law professor emeritus Alan Scheflin on the dark side of hypnosis, which includes MK-Ultra. The newly published Routledge International Handbook of Clinical Hypnosis is a compendium of state-of-the-art neuroscience focusing on practice-oriented aspects of clinical hypnosis in healthcare settings. It contains the work of 90 contributors from the global field. Dr. Julie H. Linden, Ph.D., was the lead editor. Julie spoke about the continued increased interest in medicine surrounding clinical hypnotic techniques. We discussed how important and beneficial that could be when prescribing physicians and their ability to offer patients alternatives or integrative therapies for traditional pharmaceutical-based treatment plans, such as pain management.

      "description": "Anthony Davis is a British broadcaster, journalist, and voiceover artist. He was born in London and has been based in Los Angeles since 2017, where he works remotely from his home studio with networks worldwide. Since November 2021, his collaborations with the MeidasTouch media network, including the Five-Minute News, The Weekend Show, and America Uncovered, have exploded his reach across the US as a trusted voice in news commentary. Anthony argues that inviting religious far-right speakers into the very heart of American democracy shows the shift to unionize the right-wing church and state. Anthony feels America fell to a dictator when Trump\u2019s misinformation about the election campaign was spread, and peaceful protestors in Portland were militarized. This erosion of democratic values poses a grave threat to the foundation of American governance, necessitating concerted efforts to safeguard the integrity of democratic institutions and uphold the principles of justice and equality upon which the Constitution was founded. \u0026#xfeff;Learn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

      "description": "Analyzing online content and how people interact with that content is essential to understanding the process of online radicalization. Bad actors worldwide use social media to post content to arouse emotions and create chaos. Distrust and polarization. With algorithms instantly and repeatedly feeding similar content, it is easy to go down a rabbit hole of authoritarian creation, resulting in undue influence. Dr. Stuart Shulman is the founding Editor of the Journal of Information Technology \u0026 Politics. He holds a Ph.D. in American Politics (Oregon 1999) and is currently the founder (2009) and CEO of Texifter, a software business serving academic, commercial, and government clients. DiscoverText is a web-based text analytics platform for improving human and machine learning. His past work includes extensive teaching and leadership roles, building externally funded teams for collaborative interdisciplinary research.

      "description": "The Trump University grift followed the same playbook as many predatory organizations, like Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) organizations. Victims are hooked through legitimate sounding offers, like a weekend sales course for $1,500. However, once the victims attend the weekend sales course, they are pressured into buying more courses for more money to achieve goals too good to be true. It\u2019s a classic bait-and-switch. So, how can regular people receive justice when high-powered people and organizations wield deception and cult-like practices? That\u2019s where Tristan Snell comes in. Snell is a lawyer and legal commentator featured on MSNBC, NPR, in the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal. He served as Assistant Attorney General for New York State, leading the investigation and prosecution of Trump University. Snell has developed a playbook for going up against Trump and others like Trump in court.

      "description": "In this era of political polarization, the landscape in the United States is marked by the rise of Donald Trump as the frontrunner for the Republican nomination in the 2024 presidential election. This despite Trump facing numerous legal challenges\u2013including over his involvement in the January 6th attack on the United States Capitol. However, Trump and his supporters are but the most visible element. The New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) is increasingly taking over the religious right movement and, in turn, influencing the Republican Party, which holds implications for Christianity and the future of democracy. The NAR is closely aligned with those who are on a mission to take over democracy worldwide under the guise of \u201Creligious freedom.\u201D Not only are they backing Trump, but Trump is backing them. This movement of politicized Neo-Charismatic Pentecostals (NCP) seeks to assert dominance through their Seven Mountain Mandate, which we\u2019ve previously discussed. There is a possibility that Trump could once again serve as a conduit for their agenda at the nation\u2019s highest office, amplifying the impact of this cult movement towards religious theocracy through the legislative and judicial branches of government at all levels. The theocratic end goals are clearly laid out through Project Blitz, a state-level legislative program primarily led by NAR operatives. Andr\u00E9 Gagn\u00E9 and Frederick Clarkson returned to my show to discuss the NAR, its background, and ways to educate people worldwide about it.

      "description": "Ne\u015Fe Devenot is a Postdoctoral Associate at the Institute for Research in Sensing (IRiS) at the University of Cincinnati and the Medicine, Society \u0026 Culture Research Fellow at Psymposia. I decided to use the title of her profoundly important journal article for this podcast. Psychedelics are all the rage. When I gave a talk at the American Psychiatric Association, there were many, many talks about the studies being done to see how drugs like psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA might assist psychotherapeutically. However, many people are experimenting on their own. Some get caught up with a malignant narcissist \u201Cshaman\u201D or teacher and experience horrendous trauma and abuse. While the public is doing widespread experimentation, Silicon Valley billionaires reportedly use large quantities of these substances. Devenot points out these tech billionaires appear to believe, in her words, a \u201CTESCREAL bundle of ideologies, which describes an interrelated cluster of belief systems: transhumanism, Extropianism, singularitarianism, cosmism, Rationalism, Effective Altruism, and longtermism.\u201D This is an utterly fascinating discussion about how the super-wealthy promotes these beliefs, and either people follow the leaders or they will be left behind.

      "description": "Natural medicine might seem distant from the far-right fringes of society until you dig a little deeper and find the wealth of \u2018wellness products\u2019 being sold alongside political conspiracies. There is a constant quest for increasing well-being and less \u2018toxic\u2019 lifestyles. Meanwhile, conspiracy theories drain resources and instill fears, including political plots, controls, and cabals. It happens in the extremes on all sides, the quest for health alongside an implanted mission searching for \u201Cthe truth.\u201D Time magazine printed a November 2023 article called Wellness Conspiracy Theories are Spreading and highlighted the topic known colloquially as \u201Cconspirituality.\u201D This leaves people simply seeking to feel better with the additional question of how to recognize scams from reality in holistic and natural health communities. Dr. Melanie Trowbridge is a Licensed Naturopathic Physician and Acupuncturist practicing in Washington State. She and I spoke about the complexity of discernment in natural health communities at this time and about how AI is changing the future of medicine. Her first career was in technology and more recently completed a course at MIT on AI. Melanie also practices separately as an Ordained Spiritual Nature Minister. \uFEFFLearn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

It must be taught and learned by each new generation.\u0022 It is the continuing mission of the iCivics organization and its current Chief Executive Officer, Louise Dub\u00E9, to ensure that future generations of Americans receive meaningful, high-quality, non-partisan civics education through the 145,000 educators and 9 million students in all 50 states served through this free-to-the-public program. Civics education is a cornerstone of learning in the United States. It is the curriculum mortar that helps to hold our democracy together. Students learn the principles of collaboration to form a more perfect union from a very early age in the school system. As they advance in other skills, so should their skills in civics responsibilities and their participatory understanding of the rights and healthy influence within a democratic society.

There is large amounts of active trauma as well as a high suicide rate. In 2022, Daniella Mestyanek Young acclaimed memoir Uncultured was published. It delved into being born into the Children of God sex cult, escaping, enlisting in officer\u2019s training and her experiences as one of the first women to be in active combat as an Army Captain in the Intelligence Corps in Afghanistan. Young has since earned her Master\u2019s in Industrial and Organizational Psychology from the Harvard Extension School and has been unpacking her life experiences in very important ways for people to understand.

This group was established in 1926 and features a power structure like New Apostolic Reformation megachurches. It has been very involved in politics. LDM has been a part of Sochil\u2019s family for four generations, starting with her great-grandmother being brought into the cult in Baja, California, Mexico. With the support of her husband, Sochil managed to escape from LDM and embarked on a journey to seek justice. In 2018, she blew the whistle on the organization to the California Department of Justice, exposing the abuse of leadership on its members and the sexual assault committed by the leader on women and minors. The leader, Naas\u00F3n Joaqu\u00EDn Garc\u00EDa, is currently in state prison and has recently been indicted by the federal government for child pornography. Sochil\u2019s story was shared in the well done HBO docuseries, Unveiled: Surviving La Luz Del Mundo one streaming on MAX.Learn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

      "description": "Navigating a deeply divided, polarized world filled with vulnerable souls to the siren calls of conspiracy theories, I find it essential to shine a light on the shadows where undue influence thrives. In this discussion with historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat, we discuss the subtle and often sinister ways authoritarianism intertwines with the psychological mechanisms of control. We connect the dots from my experiences with cults and coercive persuasion. Ruth Ben-Ghiat is an NYU professor and expert on fascism and authoritarianism, a celebrated author, MSNBC columnist, and consultant, including for del Toro\u2019s Oscar-winning \u2018Pinocchio.\u2019 Her book Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present explores the tactics of illiberal rulers and the history of resistance against them. With a focus on unraveling the complex tapestry of undue influence in modern politics, my discussion with historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat sheds light on the intricate relationship between authoritarianism and its psychological underpinnings.Learn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

      "description": "Human trafficking is defined in international law as the use of fraud, force, or coercion to enslave people. It is a scourge that operates not just through physical coercion but through the devastating use of mind control, a method of psychological enslavement. Rebecca Bender is a courageous survivor and advocate who works tirelessly to empower survivors, train law enforcement, do expert witness work, and assist policymakers. She created the Rebecca Bender Initiative and the online Elevate Academy, which empowers trafficking survivors over the age of eighteen to move forward with their lives. She found encouragement and mentorship from Carissa Phelps and Rachel Thomas, who, with me, developed the Ending the Game ten-session program for trafficking survivors under the age of eighteen. Understanding the tactics traffickers use is critical for prevention, as well as escape and recovery. My discussions with experts and survivors are not just academic; they are practical resources that shine a light on the manipulative strategies used in trafficking. Knowledge of these tactics can be lifesaving for anyone at risk or currently trapped. In this exploration, we delve deep into the intricate web of human trafficking, examining the various manipulative tactics employed by traffickers and the significant role that education and empowerment play in the recovery process.Learn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

      "description": "In his latest book, Seeing Through the Smoke: A Cannabis Specialist Untangles the Truth About Marijuana, Peter Grinspoon, M.D. has written an excellent, comprehensive, and authoritative book. Grinspoon is a primary care doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital and an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School. He has been a medical cannabis specialist for over twenty-five years. Dr. Grinspoon, a popular speaker, is frequently featured in the national media on issues such as cannabis, addiction, and physician health. His father, Harvard psychiatrist Lester Grinspoon published the well-respected but controversial book, Marihuana Reconsidered in 1971. Peter\u2019s brother Danny suffered from leukemia and cannabis was the only thing to help him eat and prolong his life. Carl Sagan was a close family friend and was Dr. X in this book. This new book is truly a valuable book that approaches cannabis in a thoughtful, responsible manner so needed at this time. Peter does consultations, talks, and trainings and is truly an authority on this topic.Learn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

If so, you can\u0027t afford to miss this interview with Melanie, a Licensed Clinical Social Worker and a survivor of the infamous Troubled Teen Industry \u2014a largely unregulated web of residential behavior modification programs notorious for subjecting struggling teens to various forms of abuse. Our riveting dialogue focuses on these unregulated behavior modification programs\u0027 stark realities and untold abuses. Melanie\u0027s mission is to raise awareness and educate mental health professionals on coercive control settings like these. Why is this essential? Because desperate parents might unknowingly send their vulnerable teens into a dangerous commercial cult.

      "description": "Growing up in the Assemblies of God, the second-largest Pentecostal denomination in the United States with approximately three million members, Paul Jensen witnessed firsthand the controversial culture and beliefs that define this religious movement. Founded in 1914 and initially considered a fringe group by mainstream Protestant denominations, the Assemblies of God gradually gained acceptance. However, as Paul discovered, this movement\u2019s high-demand and questionable history are often concealed from public scrutiny. He shared his journey of discovery after growing up in the Assemblies of God, the world\u2019s largest denomination of the Pentecostal and Charismatic \u201CSpirit Led\u201D movement. He reveals the little-known authoritarian cult roots of the Assemblies of God and how the church has created an official narrative that conceals its true history. Unfortunately, the protections of law that prohibit religious groups from engaging in supporting political campaigns has been sidestepped in the USA, so understanding the fraud used to control members and their beliefs that they \u201Chear from God\u201D has caused intense polarization with all who do not subscribe to their \u201Ccertainty\u201D of commitment.

Formerly a true believer pundit for the MAGA movement, Rich\u2019s transformation offers a deep dive into the mechanics of belief, mind control, the allure of belonging, and the power of self-reflection and transformation. Rich Logis was a podcaster and deeply committed MAGA activist. His journey resonates with what I\u2019ve observed repeatedly: deceptive recruitment, emotional manipulation, and information control that exploits the deep-seated human need to belong and make a difference. Yet, the moment of awakening and subsequent transformation makes his narrative genuinely captivating. Now, as he says, he\u2019s working to bring good news to the afflicted and to help others leave MAGA and exit the closed system of demonizing all opponents.\nLearn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

      "description": "Large Group Awareness Trainings (LGATs) bill themselves as transformational multi-day workshops. You often feel pressured to attend, perhaps by your corporation or a family member or friend, and you are deliberately not told what will happen there. These workshops often utilize eight to twelve-hour marathon sessions to wear down a person\u0027s identity. According to research by South African Dr. John Hunter, they artificially create bipolar states in participants. Hunter offers a fresh and unique analytical framework to explain the highs people experience at the end of a \u0022training.\u0022 He is a researcher and lecturer based in Johannesburg. His interest in large group awareness trainings \u2013 and their impact on mood and psychosis \u2013 is grounded in his personal experience of bipolar disorder and his participation in an LGAT in 2010. Dr. Hunter put forward the Dopaminergic-Defense Hypothesis, which offers insights into both (i) the \u0022transformational\u0022 experiences associated with LGAT participation and (ii) the common claims of psychological harm and problematic behavior associated with LGAT participation. In 2022, he published an article summarizing the mechanism behind the dopaminergic defense in the Journal for the Cognitive Science of Religion (Hunter, 2022). Hunter and I believe the stress and hyperarousal methods occur in many different environments including authoritarian cults and religious groups. This interview is fascinating.

      "description": "One of the hottest topics in modern psychology is utilizing psychedelics to aid psychotherapy. Research is being conducted on the potentially beneficial use of substances like psilocybin, LSD, DMT, and MDMA in a controlled environment. In recent years, it\u2019s gotten attention for its efficacy in treating treatment-resistant depression and PTSD, addiction, and end-of-life anxiety. Related to this is the psychedelic underground, a movement that similarly wants to use these substances to improve lives but takes a different, more spiritual approach. I spoke with Rachel Harris, who has experience in both, about this exciting world. Rachel is the author of Swimming in the Sacred: Wisdom from the Psychedelic Underground and Listening to Ayahuasca: New Hope for Depression, Addiction, PTSD, and Anxiety. A psychologist who has been in private practice for 40 years, she spent ten years in an academic research department where she published more than 40 scientific studies in peer-reviewed journals and received a National Institutes of Health New Investigator\u2019s Award.

      "description": "Ramadan was freed from prison on March 15th 2023, after 51 years of incarceration by\u00A0\u00A0the parole board and finally Governor Baker who commuted his life sentence. A Vietnam vet Shabazz suffered PTSD and drug addiction upon his return from service and got involved in armed robbery that\u00A0\u00A0resulted in the deaths of two innocent people. He was initially sentenced to death. Ramadan Shabazz is a rare success story and a model that proves a person who commits a horrible crime can reform and truly become a model citizen. In 1983, he began his 40-year association with the Parker family. While incarcerated, Ramadan earned his bachelor\u0027s degree and master\u0027s degree from Boston University. He also participated in programs to assist other prisoners with mental health struggles. Ramadan Shabazz and my friend, Dr. Richard Parker, joined me on the Influence Continuum podcast this week to discuss his life journey and the phenomenal effort to help him be a free man today. This is a heartwarming story which brings much needed light on a prison system that deserves reformation. Learn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

      "description": "With Scientologist celebrity Danny Masterson being sentenced to 30 years in jail for brutal rapes recently, I want people to hear from a woman who was forced to grow up in this notorious cult., Katherine Spallino, the author of a new book, The Bad Cadet: Growing Up in the Church of Scientology\u2019s Sea Organization, has had quite a life journey. Katherine grew up on a secluded ranch within the cadet org, Scientology\u2019s Sea Org school for children. At a young age, Katherine began to journal about her day-to-day life, capturing the thoughts and experiences of a child coming of age in a cult. Katherine\u2019s background offers the rare opportunity to tell the story of the hundreds of children who rarely saw their parents and were indoctrinated to become future Sea Org members. The Sea Org is considered the \u201Celite\u201D part of the cult, and members are made to commit to a billion-year contract. In other words, this lifetime and many future lifetimes. Potential Sea Org members take part in both manual labor and indoctrination classes. Katherine\u2019s book is unique because it is told by someone who journaled as a child.

      "description": "I speak with the acclaimed psychiatrist and my mentor, Robert Jay Lifton, M.D., about his new book, Surviving Our Catastrophes: Resilience and Renewal from Hiroshima to the Covid-19 Pandemic. Lifton\u2019s research on thought reform and the psychology of totalism, specifically his study on \u201Cbrainwashing\u201D in China, has been widely regarded as groundbreaking. His book Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism (1961) was used in my deprogramming. It was Lifton who encouraged my career which has spanned 47 years. In this new book, Lifton delves into \u201CSurvivor Power\u201D and the transformation from victimhood to survivorship. He emphasizes the importance of drawing on the knowledge and wisdom gained from surviving traumatic experiences to continue living meaningful lives. The book takes inspiration from historical examples of survivors who have endured unimaginable suffering and trauma. Lifton highlights the remarkable responses of individuals who, in the face of unspeakable horror, have created activist movements, converted their experiences into art and literature, and demonstrated the resilience of the human spirit. From the people of Hiroshima, who responded to the atomic bombing by creating an activist \u201Ccity of peace,\u201D to the survivors of Nazi death camps who combated mass killing and showcased their healing through art and literature, these examples serve as beacons of hope.

Years after she and other mental health experts warned Trump was unfit and a danger to the public, we continue to see vivid proof that the public has suffered by censoring experts! Her recent book is Profile of a Nation: Trump\u2019s Mind, America\u2019s Soul. What was behind the mainstream media silencing of credible experts like Dr. Lee and myself? We discuss this and many important topics like the \u201Cduty to warn\u201D and the importance of mental health, especially in people who are supposed to be public servants. We discuss the 25th Amendment of the Constitution and how it could be bolstered to prevent anyone who is so grossly incompetent from coming to the Presidency again. We also discuss the corrupt and authoritarian family court system in the United States- the subject of a forthcoming book. Learn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

Jack Smith has now announced that Trump has been indicted and faces four counts of Federal charges for his activity regarding the insurrection attempt. Pam Hemphill has been active calling out Trump and the MAGA cult for using her for propaganda on his Truth Social platform. Hemphill chose to plead guilty and has said the Capitol police saved her life from being trampled. I hope many more ex-members will speak up and renounce the Cult of Trump.

In 2021, they were at their highest ever at almost 50,000 murders, suicides, and accidental deaths involving firearms. These statistics are personal to me due to my experiences in the Moonies cult with the Rod of Iron Ministries, Kahr Arms, the AR15 factory, and two compounds (TN and TX) training people for civil war. I spoke with expert Jonathan Lowy who told me he successfully sued Kahr Arms. Jonathan founded Global Action on Gun Violence, a nonprofit working with the international community to stop gun trafficking and violence through litigation, human rights, and other strategies. He has been litigating and advocating against gun violence for over 25 years. He helped win over $100 million for victims in verdicts and settlements, created the precedent that holds gun companies accountable and reformed dangerous gun industry practices. His articles include \u201CThe Right Not to Be Shot.\u201D He has been named one of the 500 leading lawyers in America for over ten years by Lawdragon magazine.

When allegations of half a century of concealed abuse and criminal actions by Bhajan and his associates came to light in early 2020, which impacted the lives of hundreds of his followers and their children, Els Coenen, Ph.D., felt compelled to stop teaching and promoting kundalini Yoga and wish to help reveal the facts. In 2021, she created the website Abuse in Kundalini Yoga, a platform aimed at exposing and addressing sexual abuse, child abuse, homophobia, exploitation, business fraud, and drugs and arms trafficking within the community. If you have ever seen white-turbaned people calling themselves Sikhs, done yoga, or gone to a workshop, you will be educated about the reality of this billion-dollar corporate empire.

      "description": "Michelle\u2019s memoir, Forager: Field Notes on Surviving a Family Cult, showcases her life growing up on an isolated mountain in California as part of an apocalyptic cult and how she found her way out of poverty and illness by drawing on the gifts of the wilderness. Michelle was raised on a mountain in the Angeles National Forest, where she learned to identify flora and fauna, navigate by the stars, forage for edible plants, and care for the earth. A highly accomplished journalism professor and contributor to many top national publications, she was the 2022 Faculty Lecturer of the Year at Chaffey College. She founded the award-winning literary journal and creative collective, The Chaffey Review, advises Student Media, and teaches poetry and critical thinking in the California Institutions for Men and Women in Chino. Interestingly, former Manson follower Leslie Van Houten assisted her courses for incarcerated women. We discussed her and her hopefully impending release from jail.\u00A0 Learn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

      "description": "For anyone interested in understanding why religious extremism has such a large influence in America, this fascinating interview focuses on an elite group of Catholic Bishops who oppose the current Pope and his policies of wishing to move the Church away from its abusive authoritarian past. Want to understand more about our current Supreme Court and why they demonstrated that they lied during their confirmation hearings when they said that Roe v. Wade was established law after fifty years. As soon as they had the majority, they showed their true allegiance, and it wasn\u0027t to the law and the majority of the American people. Mary Jo McConahay is a Catholic journalist who takes the position of supporting the changes in Vatican 2, which included allowing the mass to be given in languages other than Latin. Vatican 2 stated categorically that Jews were not Christ-killers but affirmed God is Almighty and that His promise to Abraham was eternal. We discuss the Manhattan Declaration which was signed by Catholics and Protestants to work together to undermine gay rights, and women\u2019s right to choose and to promote the freedom to religious impose their version of religion on all others.

      "description": "The term \u2018gaslight effect\u2019 was introduced by Dr. Robin Stern in her 2007 book to describe the long-term consequences of persistent gaslighting, a subtle and often hidden form of emotional abuse. Gaslighting is a devastating form of undue influence. It occurs when an individual manipulates another person by distorting, twisting, and dismissing their experiences, making them question their memories, perceptions, and reality. Gaslighting can occur in a romantic relationship, among family members, in the workplace, within mind control cults as well as by politicians. Robin Stern, Ph.D., has been a practicing psychoanalyst for over thirty years and is the co-founder and associate director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence. She\u2019s the author of The Gaslight Effect and the newly released The Gaslight Effect Recovery Guide.\u00A0 Learn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

      "description": "The Seventh Day Adventist Church (SDA) is a widely recognized Christian organization with around 20 million members worldwide. However, many of its beliefs and practices fall under my BITE Model of Authoritarian Control, which I developed to evaluate control of Behavior, Information, Thoughts, and Emotions. To gain more insight into this organization, I invited Dr. Steve Daily, a former pastor of the SDA, to share his valuable personal and professional experiences. Dr. Steve Daily is a licensed psychologist, church historian, and accomplished author who has written 28 books, including 11 on Seventh-day Adventism and its founder Ellen G. White. He grew up in an Adventist home and received his education from Adventist institutions. In 2010, Dr. Daily left Adventism and went on to work as a psychologist at UCLA. Since then, he has become an outspoken critic of founder Ellen G. White and the Adventist Church, authoring Ellen G. White A Psychobiography. The book explores whether the accusations of fraud and pathology leveled against her over the years stand up to historical and psychological scrutiny.\u00A0 Learn more about your ad choices.

Sleep deprivation is one of the most common and powerful techniques for weakening psychological defenses. It is one of the most significant policies in the Behavior Control criteria of the BITE Model of Authoritarian Control. I recently had the opportunity to interview sleep expert Dr. Lauren Broch to gain a deeper insight into prevalent sleep issues that individuals face and to explore effective sleep hygiene habits that can help to overcome these obstacles.

It is patently abusive by its nature as it is based on submission of one\u2019s own conscience and following directions of a person who is in the \u201Crole of Jesus\u201D over them. Lawsuits are being filed on behalf of those victimized in the cult, some of whom were sexually assaulted in the group and no responsible action was taken. Over one million people have been involved with this group, most of whom have exited. Most have never spoken out about the abuses they experienced- including breaking sessions, excessive pressure to donate money, or the loss of their personal autonomy and sense of self.

Julie Hartman is a Certified Birth Doula, Certified Lactation Counselor, and New Parent Educator. She supports families in the perinatal period through support groups and teaching classes on living with a newborn. Most importantly, she is the mom of three adult children and can connect with the people she works with through shared experiences. We discuss what a doula and lactation counselor is, as many people are unaware. Julie tells us a birth doula is often confused with a midwife, but they are different. Whereas the role of a midwife requires formal medical training, birth doulas support the family before, during, and after birth. They assist the family in empowering and speaking up for themselves so that they can advocate for their needs in the birthing process. Birth Doulas also help educate families on the decisions that could need to be made during a hospital birth so there are no surprises and families can think those options through before they are in the heat of the moment. Julie shares her expertise in ethical, positive parenting techniques. Learn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

She based her podcast on the scholarly work of a Jesuit historian Professor Charles R. Gallagher, and his award-winning book.\u00A0I was fascinated to learn more and discovered that he teaches at nearby Boston College. So we met for lunch, and he kindly consented to this fascinating interview. I learned that the Nazis sent agents such as Charles Scholtz to Boston to recruit and radicalize Americans. These agents wanted to prevent the United States from coming to the defense of the United Kingdom and other European countries. The Nazis did not want America to help Jews who were persecuted and exterminated. Father Charles Coughlin was a Roman Catholic priest and radio personality with a listenership of 30 million people. He was a vocal supporter of the Christian Front. He praised Hitler\u2019s efforts to combat communism and advocated for a similar approach in the United States. Coughlin also used his radio broadcasts to spread anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and to attack Jewish people and Jewish-owned businesses. Coughlin also supported fascist regimes in Europe. In the 1940s, Coughlin and some of his followers began to plot a violent coup to overthrow the US government. The Nazis are still actively promoting violent fascism.

His first book, Asperger\u2019s Syndrome: A Guide for Parents and Professionals, is widely considered the foundational book on the subject. In past decades, I have had many clients who were on the spectrum and I long ago realized they are particularly vulnerable to authoritarian cults, as well as being radicalized online to do acts of terrorism. Years ago I taught an online webinar to warm folks and their families about their vulnerability to undue influence. Folks on the spectrum can be absolute geniuses and over the centuries have made major contributions. That said, these gifts can be manipulated and abused to harm or help others.

A 6th generation member, he was excommunicated from the Church of Latter Day Saints (LDS) for speaking up about gay rights and the suicide problem within the LDS church. They didn\u0027t like him raising those issues, but he persevered and is now helping others find their way out of religious faith crises and transition to a free life. Dr. Dehlin holds a master\u0027s degree in instructional technology and a Ph.D. in Clinical and Counseling Psychology. His interests revolve around the nexus of religion and mental health, emphasizing navigating religious faith crises and LGBTQ religious identity conflict. He is the CEO of the Open Stories Foundation. Yes, The BITE Model fits the LDS Church. The FLDS is much more destructive and extreme on the Influence Continuum. This is a blockbuster interview!

He has spent years researching cases of what doctors call \u201Cspontaneous remission\u201D and what others call \u201Cmiracles.\u201D We discuss the terribly broken medical care system that fails to see a whole person rather than a set of symptoms or diseases in \u201Csilos.\u201D He talks about specific scientifically validated cases where people were given a terminal diagnosis and yet, lived.

The journey out of a cult for someone raised in it differs from working with someone recruited later in life. This conversation will be of interest to all, but especially to second-generation cult members as well as counselors, spouses, and anyone interested in different approaches to helping. Working with former members is a unique specialization and Frances Peters has a wonderful reputation. I am so pleased to share this interview with her. \uFEFFLearn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center. Visit\u00A0freedomofmind.com Learn more about your ad choices.

He started \u201CCenter Street Pac\u201D to help elect any politician devoted to putting country over party, in service of freedom. Joe has a podcast of his own, \u201CWhite Flag with Joe Walsh\u201D where he talks with progressives as well as GOD folks willing to discuss what has happened to the United States. Joe and I discuss Twitter, free speech, and libertarianism, and agree we all need to lower the temperature and get more people talking together to each other. Our current system is broken with dark money and bad actors manipulating the media and politics. So it is a fascinating important conversation that offers some ideas and directions for hope.

One of the central premises of this book is that our obsession with social media and cell phones is rewiring our brains and causing irreversible damage. Specific advice on what we can do to have a healthy tech-life balance is given and discussed. Please listen to this fascinating and essential conversation at this pivotal time in human history.

The Information Professionals Association (IPA) co-founder, Dr. Rand Waltzman, has over 40 years of experience performing and managing research in AI applied to domains including social media and cognitive security in the information environment. His distinguished career includes being the former Deputy Chief Technology Officer and Senior Information Scientist at the Rand Corporation. His perspective is dire. He says that without dramatic intervention into data privacy and technology regulations worldwide, those with power will be able to conduct massive mind control at scale, as we see in current dictatorships. He agrees that the human mind is easily manipulated, provided a person doesn\u2019t understand how social psychology principles and propaganda techniques are being used on them. There is no freedom without responsibility. Virtual Reality (VR) technology is able to obtain vast amounts of information about a user\u2019s mind that can be used to manipulate and control them.

      "description": "Rabbi Natan Margalit, the author of the newly released book, The Pearl and the Flame, has an answer. The problem, he believes, is not understanding the connectedness of all things\u2014people, plants, animals, and the natural world. His solution is to integrate our vast and valuable scientific knowledge about complex systems with the ancient wisdom of the Torah (the Hebrew Bible). In this fascinating conversation, Natan shares his spiritual journey, which eventually led him to become a rabbi, educator, and environmental activist.

Augustine covers Scientology in real time and offers in-depth analysis, legal and governmental documents, and court cases. Augustine reports on the pervasive culture of white-collar criminality and financial scams within Scientology perpetrated by its members, in addition to Scientology\u0027s cover-ups or rapes and child molestation. He is a former Pentecostal who has researched Massimo Introvigne, head of Cesnur.org, and outs him as a cult propagandist along with a host of other sociologists who say brainwashing does not exist and don\u0027t trust former members or critics.

He is a former Army Captain and rising political star\u2013yes, he was invited to the White House to meet with President Obama, who encouraged him to run for President.

Most of these fulfill the BITE model of Authoritarian Control criteria. Some of these folks see themselves as \u201Cspiritual warriors\u201D and are convinced other people who wish to have human rights (women who wish to have control of their bodies, gay marriage, and reject theocracy) are satanic/ demonic forces.

Sarma co-founded Pure Food and Wine restaurant in NYC and founded the raw vegan brand, One Lucky Duck. The series failed utterly by not explaining how predators operate, or how hypnosis can be used to elicit obedience and induce amnesia. In this case, large sums were drained from Sarma\u0027s business, and both she and her predator were jailed at Rikers Island, prosecuted as if both had criminal intent. This episode is for anyone wishing to understand how an educated, intelligent woman\u0027s business and life were obliterated via years-long grooming and mind control.

      "description": "Proposing a New Model to Conduct a Forensic Evaluation of Undue Influence - presented by Steven Hassan, PhD.\n\nThe DSM-5 identifies this group of patients under a special category: Other Specified Dissociative Disorder 300.15 (F44.9). \u201CIdentity disturbance due to prolonged and intense coercive persuasion: Individuals who have been subjected to intense coercive persuasion (e.g., brainwashing, thought reform, indoctrination while captive, torture, long-term political imprisonment, recruitment by sects/cults or by terror organizations) may present with prolonged changes in, or conscious questioning of, their identity.\u201D However, there is no established, formal process to perform a forensic evaluation on the process of predatory influence. The 500-year-old concept of Undue Influence has been narrowly defined around a subject\u2019s competency to designate who will inherit wealth and property. The \u201Crational agent\u201D model that dominates the world legal perspective on human behavior is sadly outdated by scientific research. For example, brain maturity is now believed to be 25 years of age and not 18 or even 21. The Social Influence Model developed by Alan Scheflin will be presented as well as the Influence Continuum and BITE model. Specific suggestions for developing a twenty-first century forensic evaluation for undue influence will be presented. Multiple real-life examples will be analyzed which include destructive cults, sex trafficking, and testamentary capacity.\n\n********************************************\nLearn more at: https://freedomofmind.com/ \n\nSubscribe to The Influence Continuum podcast: https://freedomofmind.com/podcast-3/ \n\nEnroll in the online course, Understanding Cults: The Basics: https://freedomofmind.com/online-course-understanding-cults-the-basics/ \n\nSubscribe to the Freedom of Mind newsletter: https://freedomofmind.com/subscribe/\n\nRead or listen to Dr. Hassan\u0027s books: https://freedomofmind.com/books/",

      "description": "The Need to Update the Law\r Regarding Undue Influence\nSteven Hassan, PhD\nThomas Gutheil, MD\nBarry Roth, MD\n\nIn British law, undue influence is a 500-year-old legal concept. Currently, Testamentary Capacity has a very low standard of competency and does not consider modern knowledge about hypnosis, social influence, or characteristics of predatory individuals and organizations. Several cases that show how social influence can be used to subvert an adult\u2019s capacity to give informed consent will be discussed in this presentation. One involves a case of a divorce attorney, Michael Fine, who was covertly hypnotizing his female clients to have sex with him and giving amnesia to his victims, so they could not report the crime. Another case involves a 21-year-old man who was recruited into a destructive cult and who gave his inheritance to the cult guru. Two models will be presented which might be useful to begin to frame how the legal system should be looking at Undue Influence. The first is an Influence Continuum which goes from ethical, healthy influence on one end to unethical destructive mind control on the other end. The second is the BITE model of unethical mind control which uses four overlapping components: Behavior Control, Information Control, Thought Control, and Emotional Control to begin to evaluate where on the continuum any particular case may be. These cases and their implications will be discussed in this presentation.\n\nFreedom of Mind as a Human Rights Principle\nMatthew Bywater, MSc\n\nFreedom of mind remains largely unknown as a concept in popular parlance, particularly compared to conventional notions such as freedom of speech and freedom of belief. National legal systems have traditionally neglected issues of psychological coercion. In the texts of the various international human rights documents, nowhere is freedom of mind cited explicitly. In today\u2019s world, the need for stronger and more explicit protection for the mind is urgent, and efforts to promote freedom of mind must take place at a national and international level. Equally important is the need for a popular understanding of just what exactly is \u201Cfreedom of mind\u201D; individuals need to know what a right constitutes if they are to make a claim for that right. This presentation presents some definitions of freedom of mind and potential obstacles to its popularization, explores the existing elements of freedom of mind already present in international human rights documents, and discusses how to afford freedom of mind a firmer footing in international law, including the possibility of submitting a Declaration of Freedom of Mind to the United Nations. The IALMH Congress presents an opportunity to elicit ideas on how to advance freedom of mind as a human rights principle. \n\n********************************************\nLearn more at: https://freedomofmind.com/ \n\nSubscribe to The Influence Continuum podcast: https://freedomofmind.com/podcast-3/ \n\nEnroll in the online course, Understanding Cults: The Basics: https://freedomofmind.com/online-course-understanding-cults-the-basics/ \n\nSubscribe to the Freedom of Mind newsletter: https://freedomofmind.com/subscribe/\n\nRead or listen to Dr. Hassan\u0027s books: https://freedomofmind.com/books/",

There are many similarities between the rise of conservative, right-wing ideologies in India and the United States.

John helps us realize an essential part of American authoritarianism which to this day has an international following. By freeing himself from the mental and emotional damage he suffered as a child growing up in that atmosphere, he can help millions realize they were following a false prophet, believing they are just being \u201CChristian.\u201D There is a growing movement of people realizing it was really about power, money, sex and politics, and not religion.

      "description": "Frederick Clarkson is one of the foremost experts on Christian Dominionism in the United States (\u201CDominionism\u201D is the theocratic idea that Christians are called by God to exercise dominion over every aspect of society by taking control of political and cultural institutions). Fred is a journalist and the author of the classic \u0022Eternal Hostility: The Struggle Between Theocracy and Democracy.\u0022 He broke the story of Project Blitz, a coalition of conservative Christian groups working to enact Dominionist legislation in state \u0026 local legislatures across the U.S., and helped set up BlitzWatch.org to monitor, track, and defeat attempts by Christian Nationalists to implement their distorted view of religious freedom. In this interview, we talk about the contemporary politics of Dominionism. We talk about how we got here and why Dominionists are exerting so much power and influence in public life.

MOVE was a \u201Cleft\u201D wing, revolutionary authoritarian group. Conflicts between MOVE members and the Philadelphia Police Department had been frequent, but that evening this conflict erupted into tragedy. The City of Philadelphia dropped a satchel bomb onto the roof of the residence which burst into flames and was allowed to burn without any attempt to put out the fire or rescue the inhabitants. Eleven people died in the fire, including five children. Sixty-one homes in the neighborhood were destroyed and hundreds of people were left homeless.\n\n********************************************\nhttps://leavingmove2021.blogspot.com/\nLearn more at:\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/\n\nSubscribe:\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/subscribe/\n\nLeading Scientific Research on Undue Influence, its Effects and the Law:\nhttps://freedomfromundueinfluence.org/",

Chris Lee, recruited while a student at MIT, is a graduate of Gordon- Conwell Seminary and holds a Pastor credential. As a Christian, I asked him to help explain some of the key points someone needs to understand in order to begin reality-testing whether they are following God or a human institution that uses God to create dependency and obedience. \n\nDo you understand the difference between exegesis and eisegesis regarding Biblical interpretation? Legalism? Want to understand a proper understanding of \u0022the Last Days?\u0022\n\nWish to be part of a healthy spiritual community that encourages you to ask hard questions? And its leadership gives real answers- not deflections, or turning it around on the person asking? \n\nWhat should colleges and universities do to help protect their students from destructive cults who have formed student associations?\n\n********************************************\n\nLearn more at:\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/\n\nSubscribe:\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/subscribe/\n\nLeading Scientific Research on Undue Influence, its Effects and the Law:\nhttps://freedomfromundueinfluence.org/",

During the standoff, I watched in horror as I saw one mishandling and after another. I even went to my congressman at the time, Joe Kennedy, and asked him to please ask the FBI to consult with me, but they were too busy \u0022handling it.\u0022 After many days went by, I started going to the media to talk about how I believed many of the tactics the FBI was using were counterproductive.\n\nI had information from individuals who had loved ones inside the compound and was more than horrified that they decided to assault the compound with gas. I knew it would go up in flames.\n\nAfter the tragedy, Attorney General Reno, said publicly that they would research into what happened, so they could learn from their mistakes. After waiting years, I decided to do this talk and just say publicly what I felt was appropriate. Regrettably, there is more information that is confidential which will never be told.\n\nA few years ago, I happened to me Byron Sage, the lead negotiator for the FBI for the Branch Davidians debacle. He was interested in reading Combating Cult Mind Control and FReedom of Mind. We later talked and he said that he really liked my books and had wished he had known me during the standoff. He said he regretted the religious studies scholars he was depending on.\n\n********************************************\nLearn more at:\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/\n\nSubscribe:\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/subscribe/\n\nLeading Scientific Research on Undue Influence, its Effects, and the Law:\nhttps://freedomfromundueinfluence.org/",

Last year, I wrote a blog about this tragedy and how it forever changed me: Jonestown and the Mind Control Cult of Jim Jones: A Survivor\u2019s Story. Most of the people who died were members of the People\u2019s Temple, led by cult leader Jim Jones. When many think of this tragedy, brainwashing and mind control is the lesson to remember. People were programmed to do what Jones told them to do as they widely believed him to be God\u2019s authority on earth.\n\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/ex-maga-troll-david-weissman-gives-interview-about-his-process-of-realizing-that-facts-matter/",

      "description": "A panel discussion from 1991 with James Whelan, the founding editor of the Washington Times as well as the editorial page editor, about their decision to quit because of meddling with content by the owners. The Moon organization sunk an estimated $2 billion into a newspaper in Washington D.C. in order to advance its influence and power among conservatives. The group later tried to whitewash it, but here is actually what they said. The Moon organization also owns UPI and had a huge Television influence at this time in Washington D.C.. \nTop Moonie leader Michael Warder,  was a Director of the Unification Church of America in 1977. He was listed as Director of Tong II in 1978, and was the largest American stockholder of Tong II Enterprises in the 1970\u2019s. He was Secretary of the International Cultural Foundation. He had an editorial position in News World Communications which published the UC New York newspaper, \u2018The News World\u2019 \u2013 later called \u2018The New York Tribune\u2019. It closed in 1991.\n\nSun Myung Moon was a convicted felon and served 13 months in Federal penitentiary. His wife has taken over the group and the current name is Family Federation for World Peace and Unification.\n\n*****************************************************************\nContact Freedom of Mind to schedule a consultation or to learn about offered services.\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/contact/\n\nLearn about how the Strategic Interactive Approach can help rescue your friend or loved one out from under predatory influence.\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/strategic-interaction-approach-sia-frequently-asked-questions-faq/\n\nSubscribe to receive updates on news, events, blogs, videos, webinars, and workshops.\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/subscribe/\n\nLearn about my not-for-profit and scientific research on undue influence, its effects, and the law.\nhttp://freedomfromundueinfluence.org/",

      "description": "Published on Aug 14, 2018\n\nDestructive influencers are using the internet to deceptively recruit people using deception, manipulation, hypnotic and subliminal programming and more. Hassan\u0027s Influence Continuum is a new model that describes healthy, ethical influence on one end and destructive unethical influence on the other. The BITE model (Behavior Control, Information Control, Thought Control and Emotion Control) has been helping people understand and leave totalist relationships and destructive cults for decades.  \n\n\nSteven Hassan M.Ed. LMHC, NCC (pronounced HASS-en), is an expert on Undue Influence, brainwashing and unethical hypnosis and author of the best-selling book, Combating Cult Mind Control.\n\nFor over forty years, he has helped thousands of individuals and families recover from undue influence (mind control). With over 40 years of experience, he is sought after as one of the foremost authorities on undue influence, brainwashing, deprogramming and controlling groups and individuals. Steve understands the subject from a unique perspective as both a former cult member and as a clinical professional.\n\nSteven is the Founding Director of the Freedom of Mind Resource Center, a coaching, consulting, and training organization dedicated to supporting individuals to have the freedom to think clearly and to freely consider how they want to live their lives.

Steven provides training workshops and seminars for mental health professionals, educators, and law enforcement officers worldwide, as well as for families of cult members. He writes and speaks out about the importance of viewing ISIS/Daesh and other terrorist groups as destructive cults. Steve has appeared on innumerable television and radio shows. Newspapers, magazines and other media all over the world have quoted Steve Hassan extensively.\n\nSteven is currently pursuing a doctorate at Fielding University to do quantitative research on the factors of control that characterize undue influence. He is an active member of the Program in Psychiatry and the Law, a Harvard think tank of forensic experts. Dr. Michael Commons, research director for the program, has invited Steven to create a division Freedom from Undue Influence in order to help facilitate this research.\n\nSince his own deprogramming from the Moon cult in 1976, Steven has appeared on innumerable television and radio shows. Newspapers, magazines and other media all over the world have sought his expertise. Steven\u2019s work has received praise from academic luminaries such as Robert Jay Lifton, Philip Zimbardo, Robert Cialdini, Anthony Pratkanis as well as clinical experts such as Daniel Brown, Judith Herman, Mary McCarthy and others. Steven taught Psychiatry Grand Rounds at Harvard Medical School in October 2017 and has been teaching 4th-year psychiatry residents at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital for 17 years.

I even went to my congressman at the time, Joe Kennedy, and asked him to please ask the FBI to consult with me, but they were too busy \u0022handling it.\u0022 After many days went by, I started going to the media to talk about how I believed many of the tactics the FBI were using were counterproductive. \n\nI had information from individuals who had loved ones inside the compound and was more than horrified that they decided to assault the compound with gas. I knew it would go up in flames. \n\nAfter the tragedy, Attorney General Reno, said publicly that they would research into what happened so they could learn from their mistakes. After waiting years, I decided to do this talk and just say publicly what I felt was appropriate.

      "description": "On May 6, 1991, TIME Magazine did a cover story on Scientology: the Cult of Greed and this Geraldo show was taped a few weeks afterward with Steven Hassan \u0026 then President of the U.S. Church of Scientology, Heber Jentzsch. The text of the Time magazine can be seen here - content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,156952,00.html. Scientology sued Time magazine but lost the efforts to suppress the correct information contained therein, including OT3. Heber Jentzsch, a former Mormon before getting recruited into Scientology, is reportedly in \u0022The Hole.\u0022 Karen De la Carriere, one the highest trained auditors in the cult, was, I believe married to Heber during this taping. Karen is an outspoken activist against the cult, especially so when her son Alexander died due to medical neglect. She was not even informed of his illness (that I believe modern medicine could have cured) as well as his death. Karen did a number of Youtubes about Heber, the first is here youtube.com/watch?v=VkEmstHbKIU\nMy recollection of taping the show was that I felt angry and betrayed by the producers and Geraldo himself because I had been asked to be on the show about Scientology and as soon as the segment you see ended, I was forced off the set into a back room and was told the rest of the show was on Prozac- this came from left field for me and my presumption is that somehow Scientology had persuaded Geraldo to do the second part on prozac- to divert attention from the TIME article- and of course, not have me there to criticize the cult. After that experience with Geraldo (I had been on his show twice earlier) I refused all invitations to do shows with him.",

      "description": "This video is about Masoud Banisadrin this video Steven Hassan and Masoud Banisadr discuss IS and Masoud\u0027s newest book Destructive and Terrorist Cults (2015).\nMasoud Banisadr knows cults. The son of a prominent Iranian family, he began his radical political activities in 1978 while pursuing his postgraduate studies in England. The group he affiliated with was the Mojahedin-e Khalq (MeK), a group that played a prominent role in the mass demonstrations and paramilitary activity that led to the 1979 overthrow of the Shah. At first, to recruit new members, MeK supported Ayatollah Khomeini and the new establishment. But, on 20th June 1981, it organized a failed uprising to overthrow the government. Thereafter, MeK changed into a clandestine terrorist group and MeK\u2019s leader, Rajavi, along with many high-ranking members, escaped to France. However, Rajavi, having failed to achieve any of his objectives, underwent a radical transition to become a cult leader. Members of his group gradually surrendered all their powers of independent thinking to his growing megalomania. By the late 1980s, under Rajavi\u2019s \u2018Ideological Revolution\u2019, MeK members were compelled to divorce their spouses and abandon their children as well. In 1986, Banisadr became the representative for MeK to UN agencies and human rights organizations, and later their representative in the United States, an unofficial ambassador of the MeK. In 1996, Banisadr woke up, as if from a bad dream, and decided to defect. He was one of the fortunate ones who managed to find a way out. By then, most members of MeK were living in camps in Iraq, collaborating with the government of Saddam Hussein against their own country, Iran. In these camps, the cult leader, Masoud Rajavi and his wife Maryam Rajavi, created their imitation of Iran, complete with a pseudo-parliament and a replica of the Tehran bazaar. And all the members were transformed into devoted, unquestioning servants. Fortunately, Masoud Banisadr was able to leave the cult and regain the intellectual and spiritual freedom that he had forfeited for eighteen years. Through intensive scholarly study and his personal experiences of the cult phenomenon in all its manifestations, Banisadr has created a work of enduring value\u2014a gripping portrayal of the dynamics\nSteven Hassan is a former cult member who has been educating the public about mind control and destructive cults since 1976. As a Nationally Certified Counselor (NCC) and Licensed Mental Health Counselor (LMHC), Hassan is the author three books that have received extensive praise from former cult members, families of former members, clergy, cult experts, and psychologists.Combatting Cult Mind Control: The #1 Best Selling Guide to Protection, Rescue, and Recovery from Destructive Cults (1988), Releasing the Bonds: Empowering People to Think for Themselves(2000), and in July 2012, he published the paperback and e-book, Freedom of Mind: Helping Loved Ones Leave Controlling People, Cults \u0026 Beliefs, Second Edition 2013. Also he recently updated and revised Combating Cult Mind Control: The #1 Best Selling Guide to Protection, Rescue, and Recovery from Destructive Cults(2015). He is also co-developed \u201CEnding the Game\u201D, a non-coercive curriculum designed to educate and empower commercial sex trafficking victims.",

One chapter was on the Moon cult and I was asked to supply much of the information on that chapter. Steve was a great supporter of my work. When he was asked to fill in for the Sonya Live show, he asked me to do the interview to help promote the hardback edition which was released on the 10th anniversary of the Jonestown tragedy- November 18th 1878.\nCombatting (two \u0022t\u0022s) Cult Mind Control was published in hardback with a simply atrocious cover of the author\u0027s objections, before it was re-released in paperback in 1990. During the PR tour for the book, Hassan tried using contact lenses, but he never felt comfortable wearing them. In this interview, callers ask about Scientology, the Children of God and more. in 2014, Hassan bought back the rights to his own book, and substantially updated the book to the Internet generation and includes terrorist cults, human trafficking, much more on mind control and undue influence methods, updated his approach to helping those deceptively recruited into cults and much more. For those who have read the original and the new volume, they say the new book is SO much better.",

It begins with comments about the talk given just before by Stephen Parsons on shunning and disfelllowshipping/ excommunication....\nSteve had just flown to Stockholm from Toronto and doing the Getting Clear conference on Scientology (gettingclear.co) and did a presentation with Jon Atack, Christian Szurko and Chris Shelton about mind control in Scientology and specific hypnotic patterns used in the TRs and other Hubbard \u0022tech\u0022. Those videos will be made available online shortly.\nSteve has just released a dramatically updated edition of Combating Cult Mind Control which includes describing those who were raised in cults and still carry with them the trauma and other negative emotional and psychological patterns. This video is a must see for all therapists and is especially helpful for people who were raised in a high demand group.\nSteve\u0027s private practice includes doing intensive short-term therapy with SGA\u0027s (Second Generation Adults) which is 24 hours, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday (Wednesday off for rest and digestion of material, as well as sightseeing in Boston).

They also discuss Sun Myung Moon, politics, as Wood was in charge of the cult\u0027s political arm in the late 1960s and early 1970s. They also discuss cults and mind control.\n\nWood was an alcohol and addictions specialist, and author of his memoir, Moonstruck. His web site is\nallentwood.com/\n\nIf you haven\u0027t read the revised, updated edition of Combating Cult Mind Control (kindle came out March, 2015 and paperback in April), please have a read. People are giving rave reviews and it includes human trafficking, terrorist groups like MeK, ISIS, Boko Haram and much more.\n\nNOTE: Our computer froze when uploading the interview and a lot was lost unfortunately.

      "description": "This talk was sponsored by The Secular Society of MIT as the last one in a series (ssomit.mit.edu/) and was scheduled months before the Boston Marathon Bombings.\nThe speakers before me in the series were:\nSteve Pinker on the evolutionary psychology of religion\nJonathan Lane on early childhood perceptions of the supernatural\nCatherin Caldwell-Harris on the psychology of nonbelief\nMonroe Butler on the neurology of religiosity\nWhen the two bombers were identified, people who knew Dzhokhar Tsarnaev were in total disbelief that he could be involved in such a despicable terrorist act as they knew him to be a kind, intelligent, warm, socially connected person. He was Captain of the wrestling team, graduate of Cambridge Ridge and Latin High School, who liked to party and had many friends. The big question in the media was: whether or not he could have been brainwashed. Immediately the suspicion was that his 7 yr older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who had converted and became a more religious Muslim might have exercised undue influence over not only his brother but Katherine Russell, the woman he married. She dropped out of college, abandoned her life goals, converted to Islam and reportedly worked 70-80 hours to support Tamerlan and their young child.\nI appeared on CNN, FOX PBS, NPR and other shows to discuss the possibility that maybe Tamerlan had been the subject of radicalization through undue influence tactics, and then influenced his brother and wife. Due to the lack of facts, my comments were based solely on my own cult experience in the 1970s and my 36 years of experience dealing with people who have experienced radical personality change due to mind control techniques described in the BITE model. The students and faculty present were particularly interested in me describing recruitment and indoctrination techniques.",

Do you know anybody that does not serve Jehovah? Then let them know they will die.\u201D These are some of the fear beliefs the Watchtower Society teaches its members.\nSteve Hassan and Gregorio Smith do questions and answers after the film.\n-Excerpt from TRUTH BE TOLD\nNEW YORK, NY \u2013 May 6, 2013 - SMITHKRAFT PRODUCTIONS, LLC announced a Brookline, MA promotional screening of TRUTH BE TOLD. The one-off engagement will take place on Wednesday, June 5, 2013 at the Coolidge Corner Theater.\nShow begins at 7pm. There will be a Q\u0026A session with director Gregorio Smith after the screening. Invited guests include noted author, cult expert and mental health counselor Steven Hassan.\nABOUT THE FILM\nTRUTH BE TOLD - a new feature-length documentary - lifts the veil on the seemingly benign Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses religion to expose a profit-driven, isolationist culture characterized by fear, totalitarian corporate leadership, intellectual \u0026 spiritual intimidation, suspension of critical thinking, failed prophecies, doctrinal inconsistency and improper handling of physical and sexual abuse allegations within the church.\nSee former Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses candidly discuss growing up inside the religion. They reveal experiences including the effects of proselytizing door-to-door, shunning non- observant family and friends, suffering the discouragement of pursuing dreams like gaining a higher education, missing other societal holidays and customs. And more...\nUltimately the film reveals why Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses have the lowest retention rate of any religion with only 37% of those raised as Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses continuing their affiliation with the religion.\nThis expos\u00E9 - the title of which refers to the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses\u2019 perception that their beliefs are \u0027the truth\u0027 - is the first feature-film directed by Gregorio Smith.\n[MORE]\nPage |2 Trailers, excerpts, production stills and other content are available on the official TRUTH\nBE TOLD website: hereliesthetruth.com\nTRUTH BE TOLD on Facebook: facebook.com/hereliesthetruth VENUE INFO\nWidely regarded as one of New England\u2019s most beloved cultural landmarks, the Coolidge Corner Theatre is one of the nation\u2019s most prominent independently operated movie theatres, run by the not-for-profit Coolidge Corner Theatre Foundation.\nThe Coolidge Corner Theatre is fully accessible and is located at 290 Harvard Street in the heart of Coolidge Corner, Brookline, Massachusetts (4 miles from Boston).\nVisit coolidge.org to purchase tickets and box office information.

Her husband Bill, also an ex-member of the WCG, was interviewed too by Steve Hassan while he was in Cleveland as the keynote speaker at the Human Trafficking Symposium co-sponsored by Beech Brook and the Rene Jones Empowerment Center on January 10, 2014. Kim grew up in the WCG from the age of eight, exiting in the mid 90\u2019s after 30 years. She and her husband raised 3 children while in the church, all of whom are no longer affiliated with the WCG. \nIn her role at Beech Brook, Kim oversees the psychotherapeutic treatment of 70 Residential children with severe mental health disorders including trauma resulting from Human Trafficking experiences. She feels it is vital that Mental Health professionals treating the trafficked adolescent or adult have a working knowledge of destructive influence, coercion and mind control to adequately address the relationship trauma experienced by the trafficked victim. Kim also maintains a private practice working with those who are contemplating leaving their groups, or have left and need someone who can relate to their experience while providing therapeutic support. As a trauma trained clinician she draws on several treatment models which inform her practice including Steve Hassan\u2019s Strategic Interaction Approach and BITE model, as well as the Lifton and Singer models of understanding cultic mind control. She along with Steve, Rachel Thomas and Christine Marie Katas will be participating in a workshop at the International Cultic Studies Conference (ICSA) in July in Washington D.C. looking at the topic of Human Trafficking and the Cult/Mind Control phenomenon. Kim can be reached at meyerkim@roadrunner.com.\n\nRev. Bill Meyer is a former member of the World Wide Church of God. He joined the group on his own as a sixteen year old in the mid 1960\u2019s. He became a lay pastor who planted and pastored a WCG congregation in Northeast Ohio in the mid 1990\u2019s. When he resigned and quit the WCG after about two years \u2013 and explained why to the congregation \u2013 it also voted to exit the WCG. To avoid just replicating the old system in new clothes, the congregation joined the mainline Protestant Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Meyer, a graduate of the Worldwide Church of God\u2019s former Ambassador College, Ohio State University and Ashland Theological Seminary, was later ordained by the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and has partner status in the United Church of Christ. He has pastored Disciple of Christ, UCC and Presbyterian Church USA congregations part time. He works full time as an editor for the Cleveland Plain Dealer and is also an Ohio licensed Professional Counselor. Bill can be reached at williamdmeyer@msn.com.\nWCG is now known (and has been for sometime) as Grace Communion International (GCI).",

These services include access to food, shelter, job training, intensive case management, legal assistance, mental health and wellness, alternative non-western healing therapies, education, and life skills training. CAST\u2019s emergency response program also includes a 24-hour hotline (888-539-2373) to receive information on potential trafficking cases from all members of the community, including victims themselves. CAST also has a survivor leadership and advocacy program, which includes a Survivor Leadership and Advisory Caucus. Through the caucus, survivors who have graduated from the CAST program become leaders and advocates and strengthen the CAST survivor community.

      "description": "Along with an infectious laugh and a soulful voice, Rabbi Moshe Waldoks \u2014 Reb Moshe \u2014 brings many years of deep and eclectic experiences to his role as Temple Beth Zion\u2019s spiritual leader. Educated in a Yiddish-speaking yeshiva and holding a doctorate in Jewish intellectual history, Reb Moshe taught at Wellesley, Hebrew College and Brandeis before receiving smicha, or post-denominational ordination, by his mentors, Rabbis Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, Arthur Green and Everett Gendler.\nAlthough grounded in the wisdom of these remarkable rabbis, Reb Moshe is temperamentally inclined to experiment. For example, his spiritual practices have been influenced by his meditation teacher, Sylvia Boorstein (author of That\u2019s Funny, You Don\u2019t Look Buddhist: On Being a Faithful Jew and a Passionate Buddhist). To help integrate meditation practices and Jewish prayer, in 2005 Reb Moshe founded Nishmat Hayyim: The Breath of Life Jewish Meditation Community.\nOne of the hallmarks of Reb Moshe\u2019s career has been his activities as a bridge-builder across cultures and faiths. Participating in a groundbreaking encounter with Polish Catholicism in 1988 as a guest of Krakow\u2019s Cardinal Macharski, Reb Moshe and his colleagues confronted the age-old anti-Semitic teachings of the pre-Vatican II Polish Church. This encounter was especially poignant, as Reb Moshe and his group from the anti-defamation league, led by Lenny Zakim, toured Auschwitz with the Cardinal. Almost all of Reb Moshe\u2019s maternal relatives were murdered at Auschwitz, and it seemed virtually impossible that a grandson of a Polish Jew murdered by the Germans would be accompanying a Catholic cardinal to the place of their destruction. This trip led to Reb Moshe\u2019s active, ongoing Jewish-Catholic and Jewish-Christian Dialogue in the Boston area.\nIn 1989, Reb Moshe was instrumental in arranging the first meeting between the leader of Tibetan Buddhism, the Dalai Lama (which means, literally, Ocean of Wisdom) in a Buddhist monastery here in the United States. This encounter led to the historic \u201CJew in the Lotus\u201D trip to Dharamsala, India in the fall of 1990 and Reb Moshe\u2019s continued involvement in Jewish-Buddhist Dialogue.\nIn recent years, Reb Moshe has been active in creating a center for Jewish-Muslim Relations in Boston and has initiated and supported TBZ\u2019s affiliation with the Greater Boston Inferfaith Organization. In addition, Reb Moshe is an active member of the Brookline Clergy Association. In 2008, Reb Moshe was chosen by Newsweek magazine as one of the top 25 pulpit Rabbis in the United States.\nA storyteller and stand-up comedian (he is co-editor of The Big Book of Jewish Humor), Reb Moshe has used humor to animate our once-diminished shul. \u201CI\u2019m a real advocate of joy,\u201D he has noted. His joyful congregants agree.\nSince 1998, Reb Moshe has transformed our congregation from a few dozen (mostly-elderly) members, to a vibrant and diverse community of nearly 600. Based on his unique talents and TBZ\u2019s remarkable growth, Reb Moshe has become a much-sought lecturer on evolving Jewish culture and spiritual renewal.\nWith his wife, Anne, and their three daughters, Reb Moshe infuses our community with spirit, song, laughter and learning.",

The book focuses on Aum Shinrikyo, the cult of Shoko Asahara who ordered the manufacture and ultimate sarin gassing of thousands on the subways of Tokyo.

MeK was founded by three university graduates, and a few years later Masoud Rajavi became a member. After the execution of all of its original founders by the Shah\u0027s regime, Rajavi became its self-appointed leader, and gradually changed the group into what it is now. Maryam Rajavi was a mere member, only known as the wife of a high-ranking member of the group named Mehdi Abrishamchii. In 1984 (in a manner similar to David Koresh\u0027s actions) she was asked to leave her husband and marry Masoud Rajavi in order to become co-leader of the organization, and did so. See https://www.freedomofmind.com/Info/infoDet.php?id=504 for more information. Masoud Banisadr\u0027s web site is RIDC.info and banisadr.info/.

      "description": "The Strategic Interactive Approach (SIA) is the focus of my second book, published in 2000 entitled Releasing the Bonds: Empowering People to Think for Themselves. People often feel so helpless, hurt and frustrated when a loved one has gotten involved with a controlling person or group. This is a approach based on love and using effective communication strategies to respectfully empower people to help themselves.\nThe talk was over an hour and the lighting was poor, however, it has been on my freedomofmind.com web site for several years and people have told me how helpful it has been for them to watch it.\nSince leaving the Moonies in 1976, I was involved with deprogramming for about a year before deciding it was not a way to really help people that was respectful. Courts decided not to allow ex-parte conservatorships for adult cult members, so it became illegal to be involved with anything involuntary. So because of this, we evolved what was called \u0022exit-counseling\u0022 but although it was legal and voluntary, it was hard to apply to most destructive cult situations. So the Strategic Interaction Approach evolved in which I worked with family and friends and developed a team to use ethical influence within a respectful, nuanced approach which is totally customized to fit any situation.\nIn July 2012, Steve released Freedom of Mind: Helping Loved Ones Leave Controlling People, Cults and Beliefs in paperback on amazon.com and in 3 e-book formats. Please read the book as it is much more updated that this talk.",

The church believes that he is the second coming of Christ. Ahn Sahng-Hong was baptized in 1948 and died in 1985 and the current leader of the church is Ahn\u0027s spiritual wife, Zang Gil-Jah (\uC7A5\uAE38\uC790), known in the church as \u0022the Heavenly Mother\u0022,[1] and the General Pastor is Kim Joo-Cheol.\u0022\nI shot this video in July 2010 of Professor Tark at a conference where many former members of a wide variety of destructive, totalitarian groups met. I had never heard of Professor Tark, but came to learn that his father was the mosst famous anti-cult minister in Korea. He was unfortunately assassinated by a cult member (not someone from WMSCOG). He is professor of Religion at Busan Presbyterian University. His web site, unfortunately only in Korean is hdjongkyo.co.kr",
