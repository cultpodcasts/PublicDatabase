Lawmakers and survivors want to know: Who\u2019s deciding what gets hidden? Who gets access to the unredacted files? And why does this DOJ \u201Crelease\u201D still feel like it\u0027s hiding so much?\n\nNow, while online speculation swirls about whether Hilary Clinton and former President Bill appear in the Epstein files, Hilary has accused the Trump administration of an Epstein Files \u201Ccover-up,\u201D intensifying the backlash across social media.\n\nThis livestream will also cover the ongoing ICE crackdown in Minnesota, dramatic video and testimony continue spreading rapidly including renewed outrage after a Senate hearing featured footage tied to the shooting death of Alex Pretti, triggering fierce debate about ICE tactics and use of force.\n\nTogether, we\u2019ll explore critical questions, including:\n- What the newly released Epstein Files actually reveal and what redactions may be hiding\n- Why DOJ transparency fights often become battles over power, secrecy, and control\n- How political figures use \u201CEpstein discourse\u201D as a weapon for loyalty enforcement and narrative control\n- How viral ICE raid footage spreads fear, compliance, and psychological destabilization\n- What Minnesota\u2019s crackdown shows about government force and media manipulation\n- How cult psychology, undue influence, and authoritarian messaging distort public perception and accountability\n\n\uD83D\uDCC5 Time: Wednesday, February 18, 2026 at 2:00 PM Eastern\n\uD83D\uDD34 Live: Join us for this live discussion \u2014 we will be taking viewer questions!\n\n#EpsteinFiles #JeffreyEpstein #PamBondi #DOJ #EpsteinFilesTransparencyAct #Redactions #JamieRaskin #HillaryClinton #CoverUp #MarjorieTaylorGreene #Trump #MAGA #ICE #Minnesota #TomHoman #AlexPretti #BreakingNews #StevenHassan #CultOfTrump #BITEModel #CultPsychology #UndueInfluence #Propaganda #Disinformation #MediaManipulation #Authoritarianism #Transparency #Surveillance #CurrentEvents\n\n********************************************\nSubscribe to The Influence Continuum podcast: https://freedomofmind.com/podcast-3/ \n\nEnroll in our courses - \nhttps://courses.freedomofmind.com/collections\n\nDownload a .pdf of the BITE model here!\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/cult-mind-control/bite-model/\n\nSubscribe to the Freedom of Mind newsletter: https://freedomofmind.com/subscribe/\n\nRead or listen to Dr. Hassan\u0027s books: https://freedomofmind.com/books/",

      "description": "JD Vance once called Trump \u201CAmerica\u2019s Hitler\u201D so why did he join MAGA? In this episode of Cults, Culture, \u0026 Coercion, Dr. Steven Hassan interviews JD Vance\u0027s relative, Nikki McCarty on Christian nationalism, Pentecostal indoctrination, and authoritarian extremism.\n\nNikki McCarty, JD Vance\u0027s relative and the \u201Cchildless cat lady\u201D he often refers to, shares her firsthand experience growing up in a high-control Christian nationalist environment shaped by purity culture, rapture theology, emotional manipulation, and media control.\n\nThey also explore Nikki\u2019s relationship to JD Vance\u2019s family and her shock at watching his public political evolution from condemning Trump and warning of fascism, to embracing the MAGA movement. Nikki reflects on how hopeful she once felt that Vance might become a bridge between divided family members and how her hope collapsed as his rhetoric became increasingly extreme.\n\nThis episode also discusses Nikki\u2019s late autism diagnosis, her experience coming out as a member of the LGBT community after growing up in homophobic religious culture, and the painful reality of family estrangement in an era of political polarization. Together, they explore how mind control dynamics don\u2019t just exist in \u201Ccults,\u201D but can operate inside religious movements, political ecosystems, and modern media environments.\n\nIn this conversation, Dr. Hassan and Nikki McCarty examine:\n- Nikki\u2019s upbringing in Christian nationalism and Pentecostal-style high control religion\n- How rapture theology and the \u0022Left Behind\u0022 worldview shape fear-based thinking\n- Seven Mountain Dominionism and the belief in taking over government, media, and society\n- How behavioral control shaped education, friendships, and identity\n- Purity culture, sexual repression, and religious control of women\u2019s bodies\n- Thought stopping techniques, fear conditioning, and \u201CGod is good\u201D indoctrination\n- Speaking in tongues, prophecy, and falling \u201Cunder the Spirit\u201D as a form of group influence\n- MLM/pyramid scheme exploitation inside church communities\n- Autism diagnosis later in life and the power of understanding neurodivergence\n- Family estrangement and the emotional toll of political polarization\n- JD Vance\u2019s transformation from \u201CNever Trump\u201D to Trump\u2019s political ally\n\n\uD83D\uDD14 Subscribe for expert interviews and analysis on cults, coercive control, authoritarianism, propaganda, and psychological manipulation.\n\nLearn more about Nikki McCarty on Substack: https://nikkimccarty9.substack.com\n\nIMPORTANT ADDENDUM FROM NIKKI:\nNikki asked us to clarify that while she believes in the possibility of redemption, she believes there is no \u201Credemption arc\u201D for J.D. Vance without full justice for the Epstein survivors. She emphasized that the only way he can begin to mitigate the harm he has enabled is by supporting accountability for traffickers and abusers, regardless of power or party, and ending the protection of pedophiles and the silencing of victims.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 JD Vance, Trump, and \u201CAmerica\u2019s Hitler\u201D\n0:33 Nikki McCarty\u2019s background and connection to JD Vance\n4:21 The killing of Renee Good and ICE authoritarianism\n7:40 JD Vance\u2019s family history and early estrangement\n9:33 Christian nationalism and Seven Mountain Dominionism\n11:36 Rapture theology, Left Behind ideology, and fear-based indoctrination\n15:50 Steven Hassan\u2019s Moonies experience and cult identity\n24:16 Using the BITE Model to analyze religious upbringing\n25:47 Purity culture, education control, and restricting friendships\n27:24 MLM exploitation and pyramid schemes inside church culture\n29:08 Constant services, immersion, and behavioral control\n31:35 Generational curses, shame, and withholding forgiveness\n32:58 Medical neglect, MS diagnosis, and \u201Cpray it away\u201D control\n38:55 Thought stopping, guilt, and blaming the victim\n40:35 Speaking in tongues and falling \u201Cunder the Spirit\u201D\n43:01 Autism diagnosis later in life\n43:41 Coming out while raised in homophobic religious culture\n52:16 Hillbilly Elegy, JD Vance\u2019s shift, and political extremism\n58:52 Estrangement, isolation, and hope for healing\n\n#JDVance #ChristianNationalism #StevenHassan #CultsCultureAndCoercion #MindControl #BITEModel #UndueInfluence #Trump #MAGA #CultPsychology #ReligiousTrauma #Pentecostal #Dominionism #SevenMountains #Rapture #LeftBehind #PurityCulture #Autism #Neurodivergent #FamilyEstrangement #Authoritarianism\n\n********************************************\nLearn more at: https://freedomofmind.com/ \n\nSubscribe to The Influence Continuum podcast: https://freedomofmind.com/podcast-3/ \n\nEnroll in our courses - \nhttps://courses.freedomofmind.com/collections\n\nDownload a .pdf of the BITE model here!\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/cult-mind-control/bite-model/\n\nSubscribe to the Freedom of Mind newsletter: https://freedomofmind.com/subscribe/\n\nRead or listen to Dr. Hassan\u0027s books: https://freedomofmind.com/books/",

We\u2019ll also cover the Epstein Files release and Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s Fifth Amendment deposition.\n\nThis week, Congress is on a collision course over immigration enforcement tactics, after two people were killed by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis in January.

They will also discuss what happens psychologically and socially when followers begin to realize they were manipulated and how America can prevent toxic influence from being weaponized like this ever again.\n\nTogether, they\u2019ll explore critical questions, including:\n- Why Trump has repeatedly lied about or hidden his medical status\n- How medical secrecy and denial can strengthen cult loyalty and group identity\n- Signs of cognitive decline and why they matter in authoritarian leadership\n- How misinformation and propaganda reinforce the MAGA belief system\n- What a post-Trump world could look like psychologically and politically\n- How to engage with MAGA supporters who are confused or questioning\n- How Americans can prevent lies and disinformation campaigns being weaponized in politics again\n-How Adam broke free from MAGA indoctrination himself\n\nThis livestream is intended for education, critical questioning, and public discussion of modern political events and figures.

      "description": "Psychedelics are increasingly used to induce altered states and help people overcome mental blocks in therapy. But are they safe? What are the risks? Dr. Steven Hassan speaks with harm-reduction expert Erica Siegel about MDMA, ayahuasca, psychedelic therapy, and how abuse of power can emerge in places you\u0027d least expect.\n\nIn this episode of Cults, Culture, and Coercion, Dr. Steven Hassan is joined by Erica Siegel, LCSW, founder of NEST Harm Reduction, an organization focused on psychotherapy, psychedelic-adjacent care, drug education, harm reduction, and consultation for individuals and communities. With over 15 years of experience across clinical research, community harm reduction, spiritual care, and psychedelic spaces, Siegel brings a critical lens to a rapidly expanding field.\n\nDrawing from her work on MDMA clinical trials and her experience supporting people who had adverse psychedelic experiences, Siegel explains how altered states can reduce critical thinking, increase suggestibility, and intensify bonding with authority figures. She and Dr. Hassan explore how these conditions can mirror cult dynamics, particularly when facilitators lack ethical training, informed consent practices, or accountability.\n\nThe conversation also examines underground and spiritual psychedelic settings, including ayahuasca ceremonies and group-based experiences, and why power imbalances, boundary violations, and coercive influence can quietly take hold in these insular groups. Dr. Hassan connects these risks to cult indoctrination, trauma bonding, and identity disruption.\n\nThroughout the discussion, Erica Siegel reflects on:\n- Power dynamics and consent in psychedelic therapy \u0026 spiritual settings\n- Ethical risks posed by MDMA clinical trials and the lack of long-term aftercare for participants\n- Red flags of unethical providers of psychedelic therapy and cult-like behavior\n- Why altered states increase vulnerability and susceptibility to mind control\n- The importance of boundaries, sober support, and informed consent\n\nThis episode offers a grounded exploration of psychedelics through the lens of cult psychology, coercive control, and ethical care, highlighting why safeguards are essential to protect autonomy, patient dignity, and informed choice.\n\nChapters:\n00:00 Power, Consent, and Red Flags in Psychedelic Spaces\n03:24 Erica Siegel\u2019s Path Into Harm Reduction and Psychedelic Work\n06:14 Power, Money, Sex: Leadership Risks in High-Influence Groups\n08:08 Inside the MDMA Clinical Trials: Ethics and Aftercare Gaps\n12:39 Psychedelics, Altered States, and Mind Control History\n20:22 Ayahuasca, Spiritual Lineages, and Modern Psychedelic Communities\n24:21 Why Altered States Increase Suggestibility and Vulnerability\n32:21 Psychedelic Harm, Bad Trips, and Lack of Integration Support\n40:18 Cult Parallels: Identity Loss After Psychedelic Experiences\n52:14 Cult Recruitment at Festivals: The 12 Tribes Example\n58:51 How to Talk to Loved Ones Without Pushing Them Deeper In\n\n#drstevenhassan #stevenhassan #cults #mindcontrol #brainwashing \n#BITEmodel #CultsCultureAndCoercion #Psychedelics #PsychedelicTherapy #PsychedelicHarmReduction #UndueInfluence #CoerciveControl #CultDynamics #CultPsychology #MDMATherapy\n\n********************************************\nLearn more at: https://freedomofmind.com/ \n\nSubscribe to The Influence Continuum podcast: https://freedomofmind.com/podcast-3/ \n\nEnroll in our courses - \nhttps://courses.freedomofmind.com/collections\n\nDownload a .pdf of the BITE model here!\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/cult-mind-control/bite-model/\n\nSubscribe to the Freedom of Mind newsletter: https://freedomofmind.com/subscribe/\n\nRead or listen to Dr. Hassan\u0027s books: https://freedomofmind.com/books/",

      "description": "Is Donald Trump addicted to attention, incapable of empathy, and neurologically unlike a normal human being? In this episode of Cults, Culture, and Coercion, Dr. Steven Hassan interviews neuroscientist and psychologist Dr. Frank R. George on Trump\u2019s pathological narcissism, his addictive dopamine-driven personality, MAGA cult dynamics, and the dangers of malignant narcissism in leaders.\n\nDr. Frank R. George is an internationally recognized expert in psychology, neuroscience, narcissism, and addiction, with a PhD from the University of Colorado and former senior leadership at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Drawing on decades of research, Dr. George explains why Trump\u2019s brain does not function like a neurotypical brain, how narcissistic supply operates like a drug, and why loss of attention triggers rage, collapse, and increasingly extreme behavior.\n\nIn this conversation, Dr. Hassan and Dr. George examine:\n- Why pathological narcissism closely mirrors substance addiction in the brain\n- How Trump\u2019s need for rallies, media attention, and adoration reflects dopamine-driven dependency\n- The concept of malignant narcissism, originally used to analyze Adolf Hitler\n- Why narcissism is an outward-facing disorder that harms societies, not just individuals\n- How propaganda, and fear are used by narcissists to maintain power and compliance\n- The contagious nature of narcissism within cults, cabinets, and authoritarian movements\n- The role of social media addiction, intermittent reinforcement, and dopamine hits\n- Why narcissistic leaders escalate toward danger when their \u201Cmask\u201D begins to crack\n- How possible dementia may intensify existing narcissistic pathology\n\nDr. Hassan connects these insights to his own experience in a destructive cult, The Moonies, explaining how followers can gradually adopt the leader\u2019s mindset, values, and behavior. Together, they explore how power abuse dynamics, brainwashing, and coercive control now operate at scale through media ecosystems and online platforms.\n\nThe episode also addresses how mental health experts sounding the alarm on Trump have been shamed and silenced, misuse of the Goldwater Rule, and why the public has been denied critical psychological insight into Trump and other authoritarian figures.\n\nThis conversation is essential viewing for anyone trying to understand Trump\u2019s psychology, political cults, media manipulation, and the neuroscience behind narcissism and how these factors threaten our democracy.\n\n\uD83D\uDD14 Subscribe for expert analysis on cults, undue influence, narcissism, propaganda, and mind control.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Donald Trump\u2019s Brain Is \u201CNot Like a Normal Human Brain\u201D\n3:01 Why Mental Health Experts Are Being Silenced on Trump\n6:44 Pathological Narcissism as an Addiction\n8:41 Trump\u2019s Need for Rallies as Narcissistic Drug-Seeking\n9:52 Narcissistic Rage, Withdrawal, and Collapse\n10:12 Malignant Narcissism and the Dark Tetrad\n14:42 Narcissism as an Outward-Focused Disorder\n15:25 Insecure Attachment and the False Self\n18:09 Epstein Files, Escalation, and Fear of Exposure\n22:09 Who Is Vulnerable to Narcissistic and Cult Influence?\n27:19 The Contagion Effect: How Narcissism Spreads\n30:04 Social Media Addiction and Dopamine Hijacking\n36:05 Why Social Media Addiction Is a Mental Health Crisis\n43:40 The Goldwater Rule and the Failure to Warn the Public\n1:02:40 Dementia and the Escalation of Malignant Narcissism\n\n#DonaldTrump #TrumpPsychology #Narcissism #MalignantNarcissism #CultPsycholog #MindControl #NarcissisticAbuse #CultDynamics #Neuroscience #Authoritarianis #MentalHealth\n#StevenHassan #CultofTrump\n\n********************************************\nLearn more at: https://freedomofmind.com/ \n\nSubscribe to The Influence Continuum podcast: https://freedomofmind.com/podcast-3/ \n\nEnroll in our courses - \nhttps://courses.freedomofmind.com/collections\n\nDownload a .pdf of the BITE model here!\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/cult-mind-control/bite-model/\n\nSubscribe to the Freedom of Mind newsletter: https://freedomofmind.com/subscribe/\n\nRead or listen to Dr. Hassan\u0027s books: https://freedomofmind.com/books/",

This led him to investigate AllatRa, a transnational cult movement and disinformation network that uses front groups like The Creative Society to mask authoritarianism, spread conspiracy theories \u0026 pseudoscience, exploit unpaid volunteers, and gain legitimacy through religion, climate change denial, and political lobbying.\n\nThe AllatRa conference Matthew attended featured figures connected to Trump\u2019s Christian outreach, including Pastor Mark Burns, a longtime Trump supporter and megachurch pastor in MAGA-aligned religious networks.\n\nThey discuss:\n- What AllatRa and its front group The Creative Society are really doing in US politics\n- Matthew Williams\u2019s observations from a recent AllatRa event in Washington, D.C. lead by Trump\u0027s spiritual advisor, Pastor Mark Burns\n- How foreign actors linked to cult movements seek legitimacy through U.S. political institutions under the Trump administration\n- The role of AllatRa in disseminationg disinformation and conspiracy theories among the alt-right\n\nAllatRa has been investigated by Ukraine\u2019s Security Service, accused of operating in the interests of Russian special services, and linked to large-scale online disinformation campaigns and conspiracy theories while simultaneously lobbying lawmakers in Washington, presenting itself as a pro-faith movement.

      "description": "White nationalists want a new civil war-NOW. Jason Van Tatenhove, former spokesman for the infamous extremist militia the Oath Keepers, joins cult expert Dr. Steven Hassan for a critical conversation about how far-right hate groups recruit, radicalize, and prepare for \u201Cthe revolution\u201D. As we honor the 5 year anniversary of the January 6, 2021 Capitol attack, after which the Oath Keepers leadership were convicted of seditious conspiracy, this episode offers urgent insight into how movements like this escalate toward political violence.\n\nIn this powerful episode of the Cults, Culture, and Coercion podcast, Jason Van Tatenhove, author of The Perils of Extremism: How I Left the Oath Keepers and Why We Should Be Concerned About a Future Civil War, shares his firsthand experience inside one of America\u2019s most dangerous paramilitary extremist organizations. Jason explains how vulnerability, propaganda, conspiracy theories, and media manipulation pulled him in and what ultimately helped him leave.\n\nDr. Steven Hassan connects the dots between extremist movements and cult dynamics, drawing on his BITE Model of Authoritarian Control and his decades of research on cults and disinformation campaigns.

      "description": "Netanyahu\u0027s government has been spending millions of dollars on propaganda to influence America\u0027s religious hard right. Public support for Israel is sharply declining and antisemitism is on the rise. Understanding political power, media narratives, and religious extremism is now more important than ever.\n\nIn this special livestream, cult expert Dr. Steven Hassan, author of the Cult of Trump is joined by award-winning journalist and Columbia University professor Anne Nelson to discuss her recent Washington Spectator investigation into the Israeli government\u0027s outreach to US Evangelical and Christian nationalist movements.\n\nNelson\u0027s reporting examines how propaganda like influences campaigns, messaging strategies, and emotionally charged tactics have been used to secure loyalty to Netanyahu from segments of the American Christian right, especially among those aligned with Donald Trump. Dr. Hassan has previously analyzed Netanyahu\u0027s authoritarian tactics in The Cult of Trump, but Nelson\u0027s new report provides critical insider that demands wider public recognition and conversation.\n\nAnne Nelson is a former Director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, a Livingston Award-winning reporter, and the author of multiple books which examine long-term power networks, propaganda, and resistance movements. She currently teaches at Columbia University\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA).\n\nTogether, Hassan and Nelson will explore how Christian dominionism, the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), and spiritually manipulative tactics are shaping political alliances between foreign governments and U.S. religious movements and why these influence strategies matter for democracy worldwide.\n\nDuring this important discussion, we\u2019ll break down:\n- Influence and propaganda targeting U.S. evangelicals\n- The role of Christian dominionism and the NAR in shaping public perceptions\n- How political power, religion, and media intersect\n- Why these alliances have global consequences\n\n\uD83D\uDCC5 Date \u0026 Time: Thursday, January 15, 2026 @ 2 PM ET\n\uD83C\uDF10 Read Anne Nelson\u0027s latest investigative report here: https://washingtonspectator.org/israeli-government-is-spending-millions-to-court-american-evangelicals-amid-plummeting-public-support/\n\n#StevenHassan #AnneNelson #WashingtonSpectator #CultOfTrump #UndueInfluence #ChristianDominionism #NAR #ShadowNetwork #PoliticalPsychology  #ReligiousExtremism #Propaganda #EvangelicalPolitics #Israel #Netanyahu #ChristianNationalism\n\n********************************************\nSubscribe to The Influence Continuum podcast: https://freedomofmind.com/podcast-3/ \n\nEnroll in our courses - \nhttps://courses.freedomofmind.com/collections\n\nDownload a .pdf of the BITE model here!\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/cult-mind-control/bite-model/\n\nSubscribe to the Freedom of Mind newsletter: https://freedomofmind.com/subscribe/\n\nRead or listen to Dr. Hassan\u0027s books: https://freedomofmind.com/books/",

      "description": "\u200BICE violence, authoritarian rhetoric, and federal power are escalating in Minnesota.\nIn this week\u0027s livestream, mental health expert Dr. Steven Hassan, author of The Cult of Trump, examines the Minnesota ICE crackdown, the fatal shooting of Ren\u00E9e Nicole Good, and the increasingly extreme rhetoric coming from Trump\u0027s top officials like DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and Vice President JD Vance.\n\nFollowing what was promoted as a massive ICE enforcement surge in the Twin Cities, Good was shot and killed by an ICE agent. While the Trump administration has framed the incident as self-defense, video evidence and eyewitness accounts have directly challenged their narrative, sparking debate and protests over state violence and accountability.\n\nKristi Noem labeled the killing \u201Cdomestic terrorism,\u201D while JD Vance went even further by falsely claiming the ICE agent, and effectively all law enforcement acting in Trump\u2019s name, have \u201Cabsolute immunity\u201D from consequences, even in cases of excessive force or death. These statements reflect a core feature of authoritarian movements and cult dynamics where loyalty to the leader is treated as more important than the rule of law.\n\nDuring this important discussion we\u0027ll break down:\n- The tragic ICE shooting of Ren\u00E9e Nicole Good\n- How Trump and his officials use fear, propaganda, and \u201Cenemy framing\u201D to justify violence\n- Why JD Vance\u2019s \u201Cabsolute immunity\u201D claim reflects authoritarian regimes and cult-like thinking\n- How state violence becomes normalized under fascist movements\n- What this moment reveals about immigration enforcement, civil liberties, and the future of U.S. democracy\n\nIf you want to understand how Trump\u2019s authoritarian movement uses influence, intimidation, and violence to consolidate power, this livestream is a must watch!\n\n\uD83D\uDCC5 Date \u0026 Time: Wednesday, January 14, 2026 @ 2 PM ET\n\uD83D\uDD34 Live Q\u0026A: Bring your questions for Dr. Hassan!\n\n#ICE #MinnesotaICE #KristiNoem #JDVance #ReneeNicoleGood #ReneeGood #StevenHassan #ICEViolence #ImmigrationEnforcement #CivilRights #Authoritarianism #Propaganda #PoliticalPsychology\n\n********************************************\nSubscribe to The Influence Continuum podcast: https://freedomofmind.com/podcast-3/ \n\nEnroll in our courses - \nhttps://courses.freedomofmind.com/collections\n\nDownload a .pdf of the BITE model here!\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/cult-mind-control/bite-model/\n\nSubscribe to the Freedom of Mind newsletter: https://freedomofmind.com/subscribe/\n\nRead or listen to Dr. Hassan\u0027s books: https://freedomofmind.com/books/",

      "description": "Join Dr. Steven Hassan on Cults, Culture, and Coercion for a deep investigation into cult dynamics, sexual exploitation, and the rise and fall of OneTaste. Bloomberg News Reporter Ellen Huet reveals how orgasmic meditation, wellness culture, and startup branding masked mind control, forced labor, and high-demand group dynamics inside a Silicon Valley sexual wellness company.\n\nIn this episode, Dr. Hassan speaks with award-winning journalist and author Ellen Huet, whose new book project investigates OneTaste, a sexual wellness company founded by Nicole Daedone. Drawing on years of reporting, court testimony, and survivor accounts, Huet explains how orgasmic meditation functioned as a gateway into deeper coercive control, financial exploitation, and sexual pressure within the organization. Together, they explore how OneTaste presented itself as a progressive, female-led wellness startup while allegedly operating as a high-demand group behind the scenes.\n\nDr. Hassan applies his decades of experience and the BITE Model to unpack how mind control and trauma bonding operate in modern wellness, self-help, and startup cultures. Ellen Huet also reflects on why survivors may defend leaders even after convictions, how sexual trauma can increase vulnerability to cults, and why cult dynamics are evolving in the digital age, including emerging risks tied to AI and online communities.\n\nIn this episode, we discuss:\n- OneTaste\u0027s orgasmic meditation model which framed female empowerment and sexual practices as spiritual liberation\n- Financial exploitation, debt, and forced labor allegations\n- The federal trial and conviction of OneTaste leadership\n- Why some cult followers remain loyal after a leader is jailed\n- How vulnerable pressure points like trauma and sexuality can make an individual susceptible\n- How cults exploit wellness culture, startups, and AI spaces\n\nDr. Hassan brings decades of experience as a cult survivor, mental health professional, and author of The Cult of Trump to contextualize these patterns within a human-rights and psychological framework. Ellen Huet adds investigative depth, showing how modern cults often hide in plain sight \u2014 using empowerment language, progressive branding, and claims of personal growth.\n\n\uD83D\uDCDA Learn more from Ellen Huet:\nEmpire of Orgasm (book): https://www.empireoforgasm.com\nFoundering podcast (Bloomberg): https://www.bloomberg.com/foundering\n\nChapters:\n00:00 What Is \u201CAversion Practice\u201D?

      "description": "Donald Trump didn\u2019t appear out of nowhere. How did the U.S. reach this moment and, most importantly, how do we fix it? \n\nDr. Steven Hassan and researcher Alex Alvarov\u00E1 expose cult tactics, psychological warfare, Russian disinformation, Cambridge Analytica, AI persuasion, and MAGA radicalization shaping today\u2019s crisis. In this episode of Cults, Culture, and Coercion, Dr. Steven Hassan speaks with Alex Alvarov\u00E1, a journalist and political manipulation researcher who grew up under communism and spent decades studying propaganda, cognitive warfare, and authoritarian influence operations. Together, they unpack the Trump era not as an accident; It\u0027s the predictable result of coordinated psychological and digital influence campaigns. \n\nThis conversation answers urgent questions dominating current events:\nHow did we get here?\n- How Russian psychological warfare and disinformation campaigns destabilized democracies long before Trump\u2019s rise \n- How Cambridge Analytica, Steve Bannon, and data-driven persuasion helped engineer identity shifts and political radicalization \n- Why MAGA functions like a cult, using fear, tribal identity, and information control \n- How social media bots, trolls, and AI-driven persuasion distort reality and manufacture false consensus \n- Why intelligent, curious people are often the most vulnerable to mind control \n\nHow do we fix this?\n- Why arguing facts fails and compassion works better when helping loved ones exit extremist belief systems \n- How families and communities can counter cult dynamics without shaming or confrontation \n- Why real-world relationships, trusted experts, and critical thinking are essential countermeasures to psychological warfare \n- How understanding cult tactics, hypnosis, and influence methods restores personal freedom and democratic resilience \n\nAlex also explains why Trump\u2019s political movement mirrors authoritarian playbooks used in Europe, how oligarch money and propaganda networks fuel polarization, and why the erosion of shared reality is the true danger, NOT disagreement itself. As Dr. Hassan emphasizes, love is stronger than mind control, BUT only if people understand the systems manipulating them. This episode is a roadmap for recognizing cult influence in modern politics and reclaiming autonomy in an age of psychological warfare.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Love Is Stronger Than Mind Control\n0:36 Growing Up Under Communism: Learning to Read Propaganda\n2:27  Russian Disinformation and the Flooding of the Information Space\n5:18 Psychological Warfare vs. Democracy\n7:16 Cognitive Warfare and Identity Manipulation\n10:02 Social Media Bot Campaigns and Manufactured Consensus\n14:59 Steve Bannon, Cambridge Analytica, and the Trump Playbook\n23:07 Cult Tactics in Politics: Targeting Influencers and Institutions\n39:48 Hypnosis, NLP, and the Hidden Mechanics of Persuasion\n54:05 How Do We Fix This?

      "description": "White supremacy, neo-Nazism, fear indoctrination, extremist recruitment, and recovering from hate. Kelvin Pierce, the son of infamous white supremacist leader William Luther Pierce, joins cult expert Dr. Steven Hassan to expose how racist ideologies function like cults and how people escape them.\n\nIn this timely episode, Kelvin Pierce shares his firsthand experience growing up under his father, the founder of the neo-Nazi National Alliance and author of The Turner Diaries, a novel long described as the \u201CBible of the racist right\u201D and frequently cited in discussions of white supremacist extremism. Raised in an authoritarian household defined by racism, authoritarian control, and both emotional and physical abuse, Pierce describes how he was indoctrinated into racism and hatred how he ultimately dismantled them.\n\nDr. Steven Hassan draws direct parallels between white supremacist movements and cult dynamics, examining indoctrination, authoritarian parenting, trauma bonding, and the long-term psychological damage caused by ideological abuse. Together, they explore how exposure to empathy, education, and self-reflection helped Pierce begin questioning racist beliefs and reclaim his autonomy.\n\nThroughout the conversation, Pierce reflects on:\n- Growing up inside America\u0027s most infamous white supremacist, neo-Nazi household\n- How extremist ideology is reinforced through fear, shame, and abuse\n- The psychological toll of indoctrination and hatred\n- Leaving hate movements through education, empathy, and exposure\n- Healing from trauma by challenging destructive thought patterns\n- Founding the Divine Child Foundation to support orphaned and at-risk children in Georgia\n- Why recovery from hate requires self-awareness, compassion, and responsibility\n\nThis episode offers rare, firsthand insight into the psychology of extremism, the cult-like structure of white supremacy, and the difficult process of recovery from ideological abuse and institutionalized hate. It is essential listening for anyone seeking to understand how people are recruited into hate movements and how they find their way out.\n\nThis archived episode of Cults, Culture, and Coercion was originally filmed on August 2, 2023 and is being re-released for the holiday season as part of a special retrospective highlighting some of Dr. Steven Hassan\u2019s most important but underappreciated conversations, offering new listeners deeper context into his long-standing work on cults, coercive control, and recovery.\n\nChapters:\n00:00 Growing Up Surrounded by Hate\n03:48 Son of a Neo-Nazi Leader\n07:38 Abuse, Indoctrination, and Racist Beliefs\n11:14 The First Crack in Indoctrination\n15:49 Overcoming Anger \u0026 Depression\n19:59 Parenting Fears and Choosing Adoption\n23:46 Challenging White Supremacist Beliefs\n28:59 Responding to Hate Movement Recruitment\n33:20 Steven Hassan\u2019s Cult Escape Story\n37:28  Healing Trauma Through Rewriting the Past\n41:09 Repairing Generational Trauma Through Helping Orphaned Children\n55:38 Recovery, Choice, and Breaking the Cycle of Hate\n\n#drstevenhassan #stevenhassan #cults #mindcontrol #brainwashing\n#whitesupremacy #neonazism #nationalalliance #turnerdiaries\n#cultpsychology #authoritarianism #extremism #kelvinpierce\n#BITEmodel #recovery #deradicalization\n\n********************************************\nLearn more at: https://freedomofmind.com/ \n\nSubscribe to The Influence Continuum podcast: https://freedomofmind.com/podcast-3/ \n\nEnroll in our courses - \nhttps://courses.freedomofmind.com/collections\n\nDownload a .pdf of the BITE model here!\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/cult-mind-control/bite-model/\n\nSubscribe to the Freedom of Mind newsletter: https://freedomofmind.com/subscribe/\n\nRead or listen to Dr. Hassan\u0027s books: https://freedomofmind.com/books/",

Historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat joins cult expert Dr. Steven Hassan to break down how dictators rise, how mind control works, and why democracy is under threat.\n\nIn this wide-ranging discussion, NYU historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat, author of Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present, explains how fascist leaders from Mussolini and Hitler to modern authoritarian figures like President Donald Trump use propaganda, victimhood narratives, disinformation, and psychological manipulation to gain and maintain power. Dr. Hassan connects these historical patterns to cult dynamics, mind control, and the follower\u2013leader relationship he has studied for decades.\n\nTogether, they explore:\n- How Mussolini pioneered the authoritarian playbook later adopted by Hitler\n- Why modern strongmen present themselves as the \u201Conly source of truth\u201D\n- How propaganda, social media, and disinformation function as psychological warfare\n- The cult-like dynamics of authoritarian movements\n- Why people are persuaded to act against their own interests\n- The dangers facing democracy and how we can resist, as informed by history\n\nThis episode offers crucial historical context and psychological insight into today\u2019s political climate, making it essential listening for anyone trying to understand authoritarianism, cult influence, propaganda, and the fight for democracy.\n\nThis archived episode of Cults, Culture, and Coercion was originally filmed on Tuesday, November 21, 2023 and is being re-released for the holiday season as part of a special retrospective highlighting some of Dr. Steven Hassan\u2019s most important conversations.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 How Dictators Become the \u201COnly Source of Truth\u201D\n3:00 Why People Submit to Power and Believe Obvious Lies\n5:35 Mussolini: The Original Fascist Playbook Hitler Copied\n8:50 Trump, Mussolini, and the Strongman Pattern\n11:05 Cult Leaders, Malignant Narcissism, and Authoritarian Personality Traits\n15:05 Victimhood, Martyrdom, and \u201CI\u2019m Taking the Hit for You\u201D\n20:40 Waco, Extremism, and the Weaponization of Grievance\n25:35 Propaganda, Social Media, and the Age of Disinformation\n31:45 January 6, Fear, and the Breakdown of Democratic Norms\n39:50 How Fascism Takes Power Without a Coup\n\n#drstevenhassan #stevenhassan #cults #mindcontrol #brainwashing \n#BITEmodel #influencecontinuum\n\n********************************************\nLearn more at: https://freedomofmind.com/ \n\nSubscribe to The Influence Continuum podcast: https://freedomofmind.com/podcast-3/ \n\nEnroll in our courses - \nhttps://courses.freedomofmind.com/collections\n\nDownload a .pdf of the BITE model here!\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/cult-mind-control/bite-model/\n\nSubscribe to the Freedom of Mind newsletter: https://freedomofmind.com/subscribe/\n\nRead or listen to Dr. Hassan\u0027s books: https://freedomofmind.com/books/",

Cult expert Dr. Steven Hassan explains how to communicate with Trump supporters, reduce polarization, and help loved ones think for themselves without fights or debates. \n\nLove is stronger than mind control, but to break someone free from mind control you need to understand how it works!\n\nIn this timely holiday message, Dr. Steven Hassan - cult expert, former Moonie, and author of The Cult of Trump - shares his proven, real-world methodology for staying connected with MAGA family members while encouraging independent thinking instead of defensiveness. \n\nDrawing from his own experience leaving an authoritarian cult, Dr. Hassan explains why arguing, name-calling, or \u201Cfact-dumping\u201D backfires\u2014and what does work instead. He introduces his Strategic Interactive Approach, based on ethical influence, emotional regulation, and building trust rather than attacking beliefs or leaders. \n\nYou\u2019ll learn:\n- Why MAGA functions like a cult identity\u2014and why logic alone won\u2019t break it\n- How mind control operates as a dissociative process, not a lack of intelligence\n- Why asking \u201CWhat do you think?\u201D is more powerful than persuasion\n- How to reconnect through shared values, identity, and pre-radicalization memories\n- What not to say if you want to make it easier\u2014not harder\u2014for someone to exit\n- How love, patience, and ethical influence can speed up the exit process \n\nDr. Hassan also addresses boundaries, trauma, and choice, making clear that no one is obligated to engage if it\u2019s harmful, but offers hope that people trapped in MAGA can and do come out.

I  this episode, Award-winning journalist Don Lattin draws on decades of reporting to explain how cult psychology shapes religion, politics, and power today. \n\nIn this episode, Dr. Hassan reconnects with Don Lattin, a former longtime religion writer for the San Francisco Chronicle and author of several books, whose career investigating cults began in the shadow of Jonestown. Together, they explore how charismatic leaders manipulate followers, how deceptive recruitment and inner circles sustain coercive control, and why these patterns keep resurfacing in American culture and politics. From Jim Jones to Donald Trump, from evangelical authoritarianism to psychedelic movements, this conversation traces the same psychological blueprint across very different environments.\n\nIn this episode, we discuss:\n- Jim Jones, Jonestown, and the warning signs journalists and institutions missed\n- How cult leaders cultivate persecution complexes and loyal inner circles\n- Don Lattin\u2019s investigations into OneTaste, Guru Adi Da Samraj (Da Free John), and other high-control groups\n- Psychedelics, suggestibility, and how altered states can be exploited by charismatic leaders\n- Parallels between cult psychology and Trump\u2019s leadership style and base\n- Evangelical movements, spiritual warfare, and authoritarian religious influence\n\nDr. Hassan brings his decades of experience as a cult survivor, mental health professional, and author of The Cult of Trump to unpack these patterns using a psychological and human-rights framework. Don Lattin adds historical depth from a journalist\u2019s perspective, showing how cult dynamics repeat across religions, movements, and political eras\u2014and why informed consent, accountability, and critical thinking matter more than ever. \n\n\uD83D\uDCDA Pick up Harvard Psychedelic Club here: https://amzn.to/4rG6bKy\n\nChapters:\n00:00 Cult Psychology \u0026 the Persecution Complex\n00:37 Introducing Don Lattin: Decades Covering Cults\n04:13 OneTaste \u0026 the Inner Circle Issue\n07:12 Why People Join Cults\n10:10 Pyramid Schemes: Fringe Members vs. True Believers\n11:52 Jim Jones Before Jonestown\n15:16 How Cults Silence the Media\n17:10 Recruitment on Campuses \u0026 Love Bombing\n19:18 Psychedelics, Suggestibility \u0026 Coercion\n25:12 Psychedelic Churches \u0026 Spiritual Front Groups\n27:35 Guru Adi Da (Da Free John) \u0026 the Island Cult\n33:00 What Trump and Jim Jones Have in Common\n41:13 Evangelical Authoritarianism \u0026 Spiritual Warfare\n52:00 Are All Groups Cults?

And an unbelievable experience that felt completely real.\n\nIn this revealing conversation, cult expert Dr. Steven Hassan speaks with his longtime collaborator and former cult member Jim Picariello, who shares his firsthand experience inside a meditation-based cult led by Rama (Frederick Lenz).\n\nWhat began as a college meditation class meant to reduce anxiety quickly escalated into intense altered states, vivid shared hallucinations, and elite recruitment rituals. Jim recounts how members were subtly encouraged to separate from friends and family, fear \u201Cnegative energy,\u201D and surrender autonomy while believing they were becoming more focused, successful, and evolved.\n\nDrawing on decades of experience in cult recovery and mind control research, Steven Hassan breaks down Jim\u0027s story and illustrates exactly how hypnosis, brain training,  and fear programming operated behind the scenes without drugs, without force, and even without awareness. Together, Steven and Jim explore how meditation itself is neutral, but becomes dangerous when controlled by a charismatic leader with hidden agendas.\n\nIn this conversation, Steven and Jim explore:\n- how meditation and hypnosis can be used to bypass critical thinking\n- the cult dynamics surrounding Rama / Frederick Lenz\n- why intelligent, creative people are especially vulnerable to cult recruitment\n- how group settings and social reinforcement amplify altered states\n- the role of fear, \u201Cnegative energy,\u201D and isolation from family\n- why attacking beliefs backfires and what actually helps people exit cults\n- how storytelling can teach cult awareness more effectively than lectures\n\nThe conversation concludes with Jim discussing his film project, The Cult of Us, a dark romantic comedy inspired by real cult dynamics and designed to help people recognize mind control in everyday life.\n\n\uD83D\uDD17 Learn more about Jim and check out his project here: https://www.jimpicariello.com/\n\nChapters:\n0:00 \u201CThe Room Turned Gold\u201D\n6:40 The Power of Flattery\n8:20 Meeting Rama: Tuxedos, Doctors, and a $500 Dinner\n13:15  Mass Hallucinations: Ruling Out the Obvious\n18:47 Money Wields Power: The Enlightenment Scam\n23:15 Fear Programming \u0026 Isolation\n28:19 Meeting Steve Hassan: Breaking Rama\u0027s Spell\n33:38 \u2013 Media Exposure, Exit, and Life After the Cult\n35:10 Turning Pain Into Art.

As reports emerge that Trump\u2019s latest national security strategy mirrors Kremlin priorities, questions about foreign influence, cognitive decline, and escalating authoritarian power are no longer fringe concerns. Join cult expert and The Cult of Trump author Dr. Steven Hassan for a LIVE current-events Q\u0026A on Tuesday, December 10, 2025 at 2pm ET, breaking down what this moment means for democracy, global stability, and the psychology of power.\n\nBack in 2019, Dr. Hassan warned that Vladimir Putin and the Russian state were exerting undue influence over Donald Trump, a warning many dismissed at the time. Now, as Europe and U.S. allies react to Trump\u2019s Russia-aligned national security document, those warnings look disturbingly prescient. At the same time, growing concern over Trump\u2019s cognitive decline, his erratic decision-making, and authoritarian escalation has moved into mainstream discussion.\n\nThis week we will connect breaking news, cult dynamics, authoritarian psychology, and propaganda, helping viewers make sense in these increasingly dark and confusing times.\n\nIn this livestream, Dr. Hassan will discuss:\n- Trump\u2019s national security strategy and why it aligns with Kremlin interests\n- Russia, Vladimir Putin, and the long-term influence Dr. Hassan outlined in The Cult of Trump\n- Rising concerns about Trump\u2019s dementia and cognitive decline in positions of power\n- Marjorie Taylor Greene and the normalization of extremist rhetoric\n- The resignation of a U.S. admiral connected to Pete Hegseth and instability inside defense leadership\n- How cult tactics, propaganda, and fear are used to justify dangerous political and military escalation\n\nBring your questions!\n\n\uD83D\uDCC5 Date: Tuesday, December 10, 2025\n\uD83D\uDD51 Time: 2:00 PM Eastern / 11:00 AM Pacific\n\nSubscribe, turn on notifications, and join the Freedom of Mind community!\n\n#CultOfTrump #StevenHassan #TrumpRussia #Putin #TrumpDementia #UndueInfluence #Authoritarianism #PoliticalPsychology #BreakingNews\n********************************************\nSubscribe to The Influence Continuum podcast: https://freedomofmind.com/podcast-3/ \n\nEnroll in our courses - \nhttps://courses.freedomofmind.com/collections\n\nDownload a .pdf of the BITE model here!\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/cult-mind-control/bite-model/\n\nSubscribe to the Freedom of Mind newsletter: https://freedomofmind.com/subscribe/\n\nRead or listen to Dr. Hassan\u0027s books: https://freedomofmind.com/books/",

      "description": "What if everything you were taught about sexuality, gender identity, and even your own feelings was too small, too simple, or simply wrong? In this episode of Cults, Culture, and Coercion, Dr. Steven Hassan sits down with world-renowned psychologist Dr. Lisa Diamond to unpack the real science behind sexuality, how identity actually develops, and why so many people feel misunderstood or even pressured, when trying to make sense of who they are.\n\nDr. Diamond\u2019s decades of research reveal a far more dynamic, human story than the rigid categories most of us grew up with. She explains how the brain adapts, how attraction evolves, and why so many LGBTQ people experience their identity as something discovered over time, not predetermined by a single moment. Along the way, she shares the psychological impact of shame-based messages, the confusion caused by misinformation online, and the emotional cost of growing up in environments where authenticity is discouraged.\n\nDr. Hassan brings his expertise in undue influence to connect these personal experiences to broader patterns of persuasion, social pressure, and high-control environments\u2014offering clarity on why certain narratives spread so quickly and why so many people struggle to trust their own inner compass.\n\nIn this episode, they discuss:\n- What sexual fluidity really means based on 30 years of research\n- How identity shifts across childhood, adolescence, and adulthood\n- The emotional harm caused by coercive or \u201Ccorrective\u201D approaches\n- How families can support LGBTQ youth with empathy and nuance\n- What trustworthy research looks like in a noisy digital world\n- How to build resilience and self-trust in the face of social pressure\n\n\uD83D\uDCD5 Check out Dr. Diamond\u2019s book Sexual Fluidity: Understanding Women\u2019s Love and Desire: https://amzn.to/4owY2W9\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Why Everything We Learned About Sexuality Was Too Simple\n2:12 Lisa Diamond\u2019s Early Research and What It Revealed\n5:40 How Sexual Fluidity Actually Works\n10:03 The Real Science Behind \u201CBorn This Way\u201D\n14:28 What Makes Humans So Adaptable and Vulnerable\n18:02 When Identity Collides with Fear and Shame\n22:15 Social Media, Echo Chambers, and Hidden Influence\n27:44 Understanding Gender Exploration Without Panic\n32:11 How to Tell Real Science from Junk Science\n36:40 Why Some Teens Change Labels (and Why It\u2019s No Big Deal\n41:55 Supporting LGBTQ Youth in Confusing Environments\n47:22 The Cost of Shame-Based Approaches\n51:38 Identity, Autonomy, and the \u201CAuthentic Self\u201D\n56:40 Why Nuance Matters in Families and Faith Communities\n1:02:10 Connection, Safety, and Building a Resilient Community\n\n#SexualFluidity #LGBTRights #PsychologyPodcast #StevenHassan #LisaDiamond #CultsCultureCoercion #MentalHealth #Influence #cults #mindcontrol #brainwashing #BITEmodel\n********************************************\nLearn more at: https://freedomofmind.com/ \n\nSubscribe to The Influence Continuum podcast: https://freedomofmind.com/podcast-3/ \n\nEnroll in our courses - \nhttps://courses.freedomofmind.com/collections\n\nDownload a .pdf of the BITE model here!\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/cult-mind-control/bite-model/\n\nSubscribe to the Freedom of Mind newsletter: https://freedomofmind.com/subscribe/\n\nRead or listen to Dr. Hassan\u0027s books: https://freedomofmind.com/books/",

      "description": "Scientology\u2019s origins are stranger, darker, and more unbelievable than you realize and today, one of the world\u2019s leading Scientology whistleblowers is finally breaking it all down. In this episode of Cults, Culture, and Coercion, Dr. Steven Hassan sits down with his longtime friend, researcher, historian, and globally respected Scientology expert Jon Atack to expose the psychological machinery behind the group\u2019s most secretive teachings, methods, and mind control techniques.\n\nJon Atack, author of A Piece of Blue Sky and the groundbreaking new book If Scientology Ruled the World, joins Steve for one of their most revealing conversations ever. Together, they break down how high-control groups build parallel realities, create alternate identities, and use subtle (and not so subtle) forms of brainwashing, hypnosis, and identity manipulation to reshape a person\u2019s entire worldview.\n\nDrawing on decades of research, insider accounts, and historical documentation, Jon and Steve explore:\n- the psychological architecture of Scientology\u2019s mind control system\n- how charismatic leaders manufacture certainty, obedience, and altered identity\n- the hidden roots of Scientology\u2019s strangest doctrines\n- the hypnotic elements embedded inside its training programs\n- why intelligent people can be drawn into extreme belief systems\n- how authoritarian groups use digital platforms to recruit and radicalize\n- what real healing looks like for former members or second-generation survivors\n- why understanding mind control is essential in today\u2019s algorithm-driven world\n\nJon and Steve go deep into the emotional, psychological, and neurological mechanisms that make people vulnerable to cults like Scientology and go over the steps anyone can take to protect their mind in a world full of manipulative systems.\n\nThis is a must-watch for anyone interested in Scientology, brainwashing, mind control, cult recovery, digital manipulation, and the psychology of authoritarian influence.\n\n\uD83D\uDCD5 Get If Scientology Ruled the World here: https://amzn.to/4riN8WG\n\uD83C\uDF9E\uFE0F Follow Jon Atack on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@jonatackfamilyfriends6176\n\nChapters:\n00:00 The Shocking Origins of Scientology\n04:35 Jon Atack: The Whistleblower Scientology Fears\n09:10 How Scientology Hooked Millions With \u201CSuperpowers\u201D\n13:42 The Hidden Hypnosis Behind the Scientology Training Routines\n18:15 Inside the \u201CSecret Levels\u201D of Scientology\n22:58 Why Scientology Targets Celebrities\n27:20 Freewinds, the Sea Org, and What Really Happens at the Top\n31:55 The Strange Doctrines Nobody Talks About\n36:22 Identity Manipulation: How Your Mind Gets Rewritten\n41:05 Why Smart People Join Cults\n45:50 Digital Radicalization and Modern Brainwashing\n50:28 Escaping the System: What Recovery Really Takes\n54:55 Cult Survivors and Lifelong Psychological Impact\n59:30 How Authoritarians Copy Scientology\u2019s Cult Playbook\n1:04:12 Final Lessons: Protecting Your Mind in a Manipulated World\n\n#Scientology #ScientologyExposed #MindControl #Brainwashing #JonAtack #StevenHassan #Cults #HighControlGroups #CultsCultureCoercion #ScientologySecrets #RecoveringFromScientology #CultEducation #IdentityManipulation #PsychologicalManipulation #DigitalRadicalization #EscapingCults #CriticalThinking #ThoughtReform #ExitCounseling\n********************************************\nLearn more at: https://freedomofmind.com/ \n\nSubscribe to The Influence Continuum podcast: https://freedomofmind.com/podcast-3/ \n\nEnroll in our courses - \nhttps://courses.freedomofmind.com/collections\n\nDownload a .pdf of the BITE model here!\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/cult-mind-control/bite-model/\n\nSubscribe to the Freedom of Mind newsletter: https://freedomofmind.com/subscribe/\n\nRead or listen to Dr. Hassan\u0027s books: https://freedomofmind.com/books/",

Irene shares her journey growing up in a devout Mormon family, serving a high-pressure mission in Honduras, and facing the painful reality of shunning and her family\u0027s conditional love when she chose to leave Mormonism.

She and Dr. Hassan discuss the Mormon Church\u2019s $300 billion empire, the exploitation of poor families through tithing, the psychological toll of missionary service, and the tactics of mind control shared across authoritarian religions and political movements.

      "description": "Join cult expert and author Dr. Steven Hassan for a somber, heartfelt livestream today, Friday, September 5, 2025 at 2:00 PM ET, as he honors the life, legacy, and lasting impact of his dear friend and mentor, Dr. Robert Jay Lifton, who passed away yesterday, September 4, 2025. \n\nIn 1976, when Steven Hassan was deeply entrenched within the Moonies cult and brainwashed by Sun-Myung Moon, it was Lifton\u2019s seminal work, Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism, which helped him break free. After learning Lifton\u2019s \u201C8 Criteria to Evaluate Thought Reform\u201D, Steve sought out Lifton to help him understand his experience under mind control. He encouraged Steve to study psychology and ultimately set Steve on the path that would define his entire life. \n\nLifton\u2019s work only becomes more relevant in these trying times, offering wisdom and moral clarity. Lifton\u0027s work sought to understand and analyze the motivation and drive behind some of the darkest events in modern human history, such as: \n- The psychological aftermath of the 1945 atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki \n- The moral struggles of Vietnam War veterans \n- The role of Nazi doctors, such as Karl Mengele, in enabling Adolf Hitler\u0027s genocide \n- The unprecedented presidency of Donald Trump and the grip he has on his followers \n\nLifton was really the grandfather of \u0022dark psychology\u0022. His work shed light on the depths of human cruelty but also highlighted the resilience of survivors and humanity\u0027s boundless endurance. \n\nIn this remembrance, Dr. Hassan will reflect on Lifton\u0027s profound insights into trauma, totalism, and the human condition and how they help us understand power, authoritarianism, and the dangers of blind obedience today. \n\nToday Steve will share stories and will respond to comments of how Lifton\u2019s work influenced their life and work. He will also answer questions related to Lifton. It\u0027s Steve\u2019s wish to share Dr. Lifton\u2019s many significant theories and efforts to promote social justice with you.\n\nFor some of Steve\u0027s many chats with Dr. Lifton over the years, please check this link: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7YWEmQ5oJH3xbfiViIzHOkbNiLwLE9-Q\u0026si=hIr8L7p0BXDI5A-X\n\nLearn more at: https://freedomofmind.com/",

      "description": "Anne began our discussion by dispelling the myth that everyone in Nazi Germany simply went along with Hitler\u2019s plans. She examined these resisters in her book Red Orchestra: The Story of the Berlin Underground and the Circle of Friends Who Resisted Hitler. When I read the book, it didn\u2019t become clear to me how vitally important it was that there was a vast resistance movement. One I had never heard about. She hopes that the past might give us clues for potential future playbooks.\u201CI think one thing they did well was create a broad coalition. So, what they did was find people who opposed the Nazi regime, and some of them were monarchists, some of them were communists. They had Lutherans, Catholics, Jews, Atheists, you name it. And they agreed to put their differences aside until the end of the regime, and then they could start infighting again. But, over that period, they worked together.\u201D Anne said, \u201CThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so adamant about people getting involved now and getting involved in a practical sense, not just the, you know, the street demonstrations, which are fine, but studying what needs to be done in terms of our government.\u201D She hopes that this would help us figure out how to save our democracy while we still may have time.

He reveals why the root causes of shootings go far beyond guns or mental illness, revealing the hidden role of psychological warfare, radicalization, and extremist influence in fueling violence across America.\n\nDr. Hassan draws from 49 years of research on brainwashing, cult tactics, and online radicalization to explain how authoritarian regimes, disinformation campaigns, and toxic online cultures create the conditions for tragedies like the Annunciation School shooting. From Russia\u2019s influence on the NRA to the dangers of social media manipulation, Dr. Hassan connects the dots the mainstream media misses.\n\n- Why are mass shootings in the U.S. skyrocketing?\n- How are foreign influence operations, propaganda, and extremist groups exploiting America\u2019s gun culture?\n- What role do social media, depression, algorithms, and online brainwashing play in creating violent tragedies like the Annunciation Catholic School shooting?\n- What can parents, students, and communities actually do to resist polarization, protect democracy, and prevent the next tragedy?\n\n\uD83D\uDC49 Share this video to raise awareness about the Minneapolis Catholic school shooting, Robin Westman, gun violence, psychological warfare, and the urgent need for reform.\n\n#StevenHassan #RobinWestman #MinneapolisShooting #GunViolence #MassShootings #PsychologicalWarfare #UndueInfluence #CultOfTrump #Authoritarianism #MindControl #News\n\n\uD83D\uDD52 Chapters\n0:00 Psychological Warfare Creates Lone Actor Terrorism\n5:39 The Dangerous Distraction: Trans Blame vs. Root Causes\n12:34 Are SSRIs to Blame?

From the CBS/Colbert censorship debacle to the ongoing Epstein firestorm these stories expose how manipulative leaders twist reality to serve their own gain.\n\n\uD83D\uDCC9 This week\u2019s headlines expose the machinery of authoritarian control:\n- Trump\u2019s crypto-friendly policies are no coincidence! They\u2019re designed to enrich him personally while promoting a pyramid-style scheme that traps everyday Americans in false financial hope. The deeper you go, the richer he gets.\n- The sudden release of MLK FBI files being pitched as \u0022transparency\u0022, but it\u2019s a sleight of hand to distract from Trump\u2019s suppressed Epstein connections, now causing major backlash from MAGA loyalists.\n- The defunding of PBS and NPR is not just budgetary\u2014it\u2019s strategic censorship, straight out of the fascist playbook: eliminate trusted, independent sources and replace them with sycophantic propaganda.\n- The Colbert censorship scandal signals the silencing of satire and free expression when it dares to mock the ruling elite.\n- Congress\u0027s latest rescission of funding undermines public oversight and aids the authoritarian consolidation of power.\n\nDr. Hassan will explain how these tactics mirror the exact strategies cult leaders use to confuse, isolate, and exploit their followers\u2014and how to resist the pull.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this week\u2019s eye-opening discussion!

The public doesnt understand how millions of people are deceptively recruited and indoctrinated into these groups and why they are called \u201Ccults.\u201D One such cult network started in Massachusetts in 1979 as \u201Cthe Boston Church of Christ\u201D and are not to be confused with the mainline Church of Christ or the United Church of Christ. This group uses BITE Model methods to recruit and indoctrinate followers to follow the top leader as an \u201Capostle or prophet\u201D or \u201CGod\u2019s chosen man to lead Christianity on earth. Unlike legitimate Christian churches this cult claims to be the \u201Conly\u201D path to salvation and demands people subit and obey a discpling partner as if they were Jesus. Their lives and free will are taken over by involvement with this group. REcruiting other, giving money, abandoning education and careers, even family are part of the playbook. Tania Diaz was recruited as an 18 college student in Mexico and spent over 20 years. She and her husband were groomed to recruit countless Hispanics into this cult. She would rise through the church\u2019s ranks, only escaping nearly thirty years later to become an anti-cult activist, self-compassion advocate, and host of a podcast dedicated to survivors of religious abuse, Voces: Espacio Sagrado para Sobrevivientes de Abuso Religioso (In English, Voices: A Sacred Space for Survivors of Religious Abuse) Learn more about your ad choices.

Mike\u2019s book, Without the Guru: How I took My Life Back after Thirty Years (published in 2009), explores Mike\u2019s journey into this rigid belief system, how he realized he was trapped in a cult, and then how he broke away.

      "description": "Hannah Arendt\u2019s 1963 book, \u201CThe Banality of Evil,\u201D is actually wrong. It portrayed the lie Eichmann told when he was on trial. He said that he was \u201Cjust following orders.\u201D Arendt got conned. Eichmann was a true believer in Hitler\u2019s final solution and a committed Anti-Semite. On this episode of Cult Conversations: The Influence Continuum, I spoke with accomplished Israeli filmmaker Yariv Mozer about his award-winning series The Devil\u2019s Confession: The Lost Eichmann Tapes documenting senior Nazi SS officer Adolf Eichmann\u2019s role as architect in the planning and implementation of the Holocaust\u2019s Final Solution. We also discussed Mozer\u2019s latest Emmy Award winning documentary, the Paramount\u0026#43; movie, We Will Dance Again, based on footage, facts, and stories from the October 7th, 2023, Nova Festival, in which Hamas militants suddenly attacked Israel. He is a third-generation descendant of Holocaust survivors from his mother\u2019s family, which he noted was an essential aspect of his story and identity. Learn more about your ad choices.

She has over a million followers on Instagram as a \u201Cformer alt-right Christian nationalist,\u201D sharing her artistic talent and complex views to dispel widely believed radical Republican doctrine. She brings this knowledge forward and finds ways to bridge communications from her upbringing within a controlling but also highly influential alt-right family from Wyoming. She now shares the deconstruction of her childhood and aspects of her healing journey in several venues, including a new memoir she\u2019s working on. Her experiences are also reflected in her music as a \u201CRocky Mountain rock artist\u201D living in Nashville, Tennessee. She writes songs and performs with her band, The Big Sky.

      "description": "The highly watched Netflix 2018 documentary Wild Wild Country for people \u201Cin the know\u201D was terribly biased. There were no former members. No cult experts. The two people featured were still \u201Ctrue believers in the cult leader, Rajneesh\u2013who was rebranded after his expulsion from the United States as Osho. This cult took over the small town of Antelope, Oregon through deceit and the commune was the relocation from Pune India, where the cult leader had with a history of legal problems, including owing back taxes and claims of drug smuggling. What was missing was what it was actually like to live at the ashram as a child, like Sarito Carroll did til the commune was disbanded due to criminal activities. On this episode of Cult Conversations: The Influence Continuum, I spoke with Sarito Carroll, about her 2024 memoir In the Shadow of Enlightenment: A Girl\u2019s Journey Through the Osho Rajneesh Cult, to hear and share more of the real story of what it was like growing up within the cult. Sarito is a passionate writer who was initiated into the cult by Rajneesh himself at nine years old in the late 1970s. She described her latest books as exploring \u201Cthe complexities of belonging, trauma, the struggle to break free of cultic ties, and the long journey towards self-acceptance.\u201D The book follows her journey to exit the cult and eventually begin a career as a technical writer and attain her Master of Science in Chinese Medicine in 2007, despite never attaining a proper education through the cult.

      "description": "In this episode of Cult Conversations: The Influence Continuum, I discussed the steady rise of Pentecostal Christianity with award-winning journalist and author Elle Hardy. Her 2022 book, Beyond Belief: How Pentecostal Christianity Is Taking Over the World, details how the charismatic movement has become a global phenomenon, with currently (2025) an estimated 900 million followers worldwide. As I wrote in the Cult of Trump, a key base for true believers are involved with megachurches involving millions of Americans. The New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) has transformed Pentecostal Christianity from a spiritual movement to an aggressively politically motivated group. Hardy explains the phenomenon: \u201CThey don\u2019t just want to save souls; they want to transform societies.\u201D For example, prominent Pentecostal leaders, such as Paula White-Cain, who is in the current administration, refers to Donald Trump as a modern-day \u201CKing Cyrus.\u201D In the Bible, King Cyrus is an imperfect, divinely chosen leader who fulfilled political and social ambitions on behalf of God to help his people. Trump\u2019s portrayal as divinely chosen in these circles is strategically cultivated to amass the group\u2019s support and reshape American politics. Hardy provided insights into the prosperity gospel, describing it as \u201Cthe faith of the working poor.\u201D This aspect of Pentecostalism attracts marginalized people seeking hope through promises of divine financial blessings in exchange for devotion and sacrifice. However, Hardy pointed out a troubling reality. Vulnerable individuals often give beyond their means, pushing them deeper into poverty through manipulative teachings. Our conversation highlighted how such practices illustrate financial exploitation and reinforce harmful \u201Cmagical thinking\u201D and loaded language. Authoritarian leaders commonly exploit these techniques to control followers, which are classic signs of undue influence. Unethical practices like these strip people of their critical thinking and autonomy. This conversation was exceptionally interesting. Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",

      "description": "One of Jane\u2019s most striking points in her book and our conversation is that cults aren\u2019t just something \u201Cother people\u201D get involved in. Cults can deceptively recruit anyone and work in many different spheres of influence. \u201CI just started pulling the thread,\u201D Jane recalled, \u201Cand traced it back to the Puritans.\u201D She explains how the theological worldview of early American settlers, particularly the Puritans, established a pattern of black-and-white/good-versus-evil thinking. The Puritans believed in things like divine judgment, righteous punishment, and the idea that only a few could be saved while the rest would suffer in the apocalypse. This religious idea was an organizing principle for our society and prevails today. For instance, the idea of an existential threat or ultimate salvation has bled into common culture. Whether it\u2019s climate doomism, political collapse, or even the rapture, American society is addicted to \u201Cthe end is near\u201D thinking. It is everywhere, embedded into our popular culture. Cultic control today has many faces: multilevel marketing schemes (MLMs), political cults, religious cults, therapy cults, \u201Cwellness\u201D gurus, and even one-on-one abusive dynamics. These groups reflect and exploit the very same psychological patterns found in traditional cults\u2014fear, isolation, obedience, and identity manipulation. And there are many cults in the Cult of Trump. Check out this fascinating interview. Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",

      "description": "Cult survivors often have the instinct to want to save as many people as possible from the cult they survived. However, healing from the things they encountered while in the cult is often a first step before a survivor can help others escape. Cult survivors usually seek to heal with some form of therapy and move on. Nori was a member of ISKCON from 1978 to 1988. As a member of the PR office, Nori lived in a bubble with some of the cult\u2019s abuses hidden from her so she could maintain her positive opinion of the cult as part of her work. After leaving the cult, Nori learned about the abuse of women and children in the cult. The University of Illinois Press published Nori\u2019s memoir, Betrayal of the Spirit, in 1997. After that she wrote and self-published Child of the Cult and Cult Survivor\u2019s Handbook For a more detailed look at the atrocities the Hare Krishnas committed, check out the documentary Monkey on a Stick: Murder, Madness, and the Hare Krishnas. Nori Muster and Steve Gelberg are two former members interviewed in this well-done film.

With his exorbitant spending, Musk is following a well-worn authoritarian playbook\u2014controlling the flow of information to manipulate public perception and decision-making.\n\n\uD83D\uDD34 How does this relate to cult tactics?\nDr. Hassan will explain how information control, one of the pillars of his BITE Model of Authoritarian Control, is being used on a mass scale to shape political outcomes.

      "description": "For many, practices like meditation and yoga are among the most thrilling avenues for deepening spiritual awareness. At their best, these techniques can serve as a neurological and biochemical reset\u2014enhancing self-awareness and empowering transformation. But at their worst, they can cause a loss of personal grounding, leaving individuals vulnerable to exploitative relationships or mental, physical, and even sexual harm under unethical or authoritarian figures. As a result, people often find themselves wagering between powerful tools for psychological growth and the risk of undue influence. In this episode of Cult Conversations: The Influence Continuum, I speak with my longtime friend and colleague, David Christopher Lane, PhD\u2014Professor of Philosophy and Sociology at Mt. San Antonio College\u2014about this delicate balance. David is the author of numerous books, including The Making of a Spiritual Movement: The Untold Story of Paul Twitchell and Eckankar, The Radhasoami Tradition, Exposing Cults: When the Skeptical Mind Meets the Mystical, The Unknowing Sage, and The Virtual Reality of Consciousness. Cambridge University Press published his most recent book, The Sound Current Tradition: A Historical Overview, in 2022. He also co-authored an annotated bibliography on the Radhasoami movement for Oxford University Press. Beyond academia, David is a world champion bodysurfer with titles spanning from 1997 to 2016. David is also an expert on neuroscience and virtual reality technology. Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",

      "description": "Elon Musk, a corporate billionaire and private naturalized American citizen born in South Africa, has taken an extraordinary amount of power in government since Donald Trump took office as President less than a month ago. Musk is seeking to interfere with elections in Germany and other countries around the world. Vance recently told European leaders to allow more \u201Cfree speech\u201D but what that means is use of social media and media to push authoritarianism. Dr. Stuart Shulman holds a PhD in American Politics and has done extensive teaching and leadership roles in collaborative interdisciplinary research. Additionally, as founder and CEO of Texifter, he discussed the analysis of Twitter data, his work supporting academic access to data, and federal agency review of public comments on proposed rules. Stuart and I discussed how Twitter was gamified through QAnon since 2017. He tracked QAnon, a tale of a high-up government official with a \u201CQ-level\u201D clearance covering nuclear weapons and related materials and tweeting about supposed confidential information. Coded language and \u201Ccrumbs\u201D were then created to entice signaling, and Trump often alluded to this through tweets. Stuart noted that in a December 1-12, 2017, dataset with 2.3 million mentions of Michael Flynn, \u201C#followthewhiterabbit\u201D and \u201Cthe Great Awakening\u201D and other QAnon buzzwords in the Tweets. Stuart noted how the Alternate Reality Gaming (ARG) characters often have made-up names and emojis and could have come from anywhere in the world, including Russia, China, India, and other nations that may not have the best interests of voters and citizens in western democracies.

He is an Iraq combat veteran, accomplished public policy advocate, nonprofit leader, and expert on the threats posed by domestic extremist organizations that work against Democracy. His group focuses on gathering intelligence on dangerous individuals and hate groups while also teaching the skills and context necessary to keep veterans and communities safe. Like me, Kris couldn\u2019t believe Trump gave pardons to the violent #Jan6th insurrectionists serving time in jail for their crimes against America. We both believe we are in World War III and fighting fascism at home. Musk, Thiel and other billionaires are on the record that they dont believe in democracy of upholding the Constitution nor do they want to help the USA remain a superpower. They are busy with NeoTech conspiracy to take over the world and dismante our administrative state using the Heritage Foundation\u2019s 2025 playbook. Kris is a patriot and has inspired many vets to step up with him to oppose what is being done to us.

      "description": "This interview had two foci: ISKCON and Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s Connection to Krishna Hinduism and his new academic book on music and its role in psychedelics states. Gelberg was a Krishna devotee for 17 years and has written about his experiences with the cult and why he exited. He is now a successful photographer and author. We discussed the more recent finding that Tulsi Gabbard, nominated by Trump to be Director of National Intelligence, shows ties to Krishna Hinduism and ISKCON. Chris Butler, who is the guru of Tulsi Gabbard, was a disciple of the Krishna movement and Prabhupada. The group is known for its homophobia. \u201CThe Krishna movement also is very misogynistic. They try to hide that. They don\u2019t like talking about it. They know it\u0027s not popular, but if you go to Prabhupada\u0027s books, he repeats what he learned from the Hindu tradition about women being lesser and needing to be always under the control of a man and less spiritually adept than men are\u201D Steven said. He then expressed concerns about ties with this organization and what that may mean by Gabbard\u2019s beliefs around these topics. In addition to his spiritual and academic education after leaving the cult, Gelberg continued to tune into an evolving \u201CPsychedelic Renaissance\u201D as the government began to loosen regulations allowing for legitimate clinical studies and inspiring the creation, by growing numbers of colleges and universities, of programs and centers for the study of psychedelics and their therapeutic effects.\n\nLearn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

      "description": "Ever hear the term coercive control? Did you know the UK government made it a crime? It is the application of undue influence methods and techniques used by a person, typically a man against a partner to do what I have been calling mind control- as in my BITE Model. However, women especially need to know what the techniques are and how to navigate a family court system in the USA which is largely ignorant and children and women are being greatly harmed. Dr. Cocchiola holds a doctorate in social work, is a licensed clinical social worker, is a tenured college professor, and is an expert in coercive control as is Amy Polacko, an award-winning journalist and investigative reporter, and divorce coach.Their excellent book is a resource for women going through divorce, married women noticing early warning signs, and those considering marriage, offering practical advice and raising awareness of systemic challenges.Despite persistent myths that women are more often favored, family courts can be gender-biased, and some women who report abuse encounter even harsher outcomes. The authors aim to inspire reform in family court practices and contribute to future legislative efforts to protect women from abusive legal dynamics.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "\u0022Conversion therapy\u0022\u2014a discredited practice that purports to change an individual\u0027s sexual orientation and/or gender identification and expression\u2014has harmed countless lives under the guise of morality. I spoke to Lucas Wilson, an SSHRC Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Toronto Mississauga, as he shared his harrowing experience with \u0022conversion therapy\u0022 at Liberty University. His story serves as a testament to the perseverance of the unique human spirit and a warning against the devastating impacts of undue influence. A scholar, editor, and advocate, Wilson\u0027s work sheds light on the intersections of evangelicalism, homophobia, and trauma. He is the editor of the forthcoming Shame-Sex Attraction: Survivors\u0027 Stories of Conversion Therapy, which compiles narratives from 17 contributors, offering diverse perspectives on a practice that major medical, psychiatric, and psychological organizations have condemned. A recent Canadian study cited by Wilson underscores the two most impactful ways to support survivors of \u0022conversion therapy\u0022: listening without judgment and reconnecting with affirming communities. Survivors benefit immensely from being heard and validated. Listening affirms their experiences and begins the process of rebuilding trust. Additionally, reconnecting with a supportive queer community provides a safe space for healing and affirmation, countering the isolation imposed by conversion practices. Wilson\u0027s story is not just about survival but also about transformation. It highlights the dangers of unhealthy influence while demonstrating the power of education, community, and self-acceptance. As conversations around \u0022conversion therapy\u0022 and undue influence continue, stories like Wilson\u0027s remind us of the urgent need for advocacy and awareness. Together, we can create a world where everyone can live authentically without fear or shame.\n\nLearn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

      "description": "Dustin Rozario Steinhagen, PhD is a privacy expert who recently graduated with his doctorate degree in Cyber Defense from Dakota State University. His dissertation is titled \u201CDefending the security of the mind: A mail survey of thought-reform literacy in South Dakota.\u201D This quantitative analysis measured \u201Cwhat everyday people know about thought reform and psychologically manipulative groups.\u201D One of the most powerful defenses a person can have against mind hacking is admitting they are vulnerable to it. After that, skills can be acquired and built upon to teach people how to protect themselves further. However, we mustn\u2019t let our guard down when it comes to our brains and minds coming under attack. Like anti-virus software needing updates to protect against the latest cyber threats, our minds also require ongoing learning to maintain psychological security in addition to adequate rest, play, and sleep. Influences are also more challenging to detect, more frequent in occurrence, from multiple directions, and require vigilance when interacting with different levels of trusted or untrusted sources. Having trusted groups who respect personal privacy and have our best intentions in mind becomes extremely important in such an environment. Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "Australian Maria Esguerra tells us that it\u2019s still difficult to speak about her personal experiences as a second-generation survivor of The Children of God cult. In this episode of The Influence Continuum, we explored the challenges of breaking free from cults and how those who become part of society\u2019s natural defense system against cult indoctrination and authoritarianism help to free others. She traced her story back to a childhood of illnesses that mainly went untreated. \u201CI had measles, chicken pox, mumps, malaria, every imaginable childhood disease, lots of parasites,\u201D she said. Her father would eventually die when she was only four years old from Hodgkin Lymphoma, a form of cancer considered to be largely curable. She explained that in The Children of God cult, medical care was avoided as illnesses were considered the fault of the person or as \u201CGod judging you.\u201D Maria is now a psychologist and Director of Assessable, an organization dedicated to serving people with disabilities. This is an especially commendable achievement in that her early life was shaped by her parent\u2019s involvement in The Children of God cult. We discussed the experience of raising children within the cult and what ultimately pushed Maria to leave. One of the critical factors in her decision was her son\u2019s battle with meningitis, which left him in a coma at a medical research center for ten days, resulting in a lifelong brain injury. While in Africa, Maria became pregnant again and endured harsh conditions. Upon returning to Australia, she resolved to create a new reality for her children\u2014one rooted in safety and love, something she had not been given. Maria is an inspiration for everyone!

      "description": "On this episode of the Influence Continuum, I spoke with Craig Unger, an investigative journalist and the author of Den of Spies, which is described in his biography as \u201Ca real-life political thriller about how master spy William Casey put together a treasonous covert operation in 1980 that hijacked American foreign policy and stole the election for Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush.\u201D Craig is also the author of six books on the Republican party\u2019s assault on democracy, including American Kompromat: How the KGB Cultivated Donald Trump and Related Tales of Sex, Greed, Power, and Treachery. He has written for New York Magazine, The New Republic, The Washington Post, The Guardian, The New Yorker, The New York Times, Esquire, The Independent, and many others. \u201CInitially, I think, it was very covert, as I show in this book. Everything was behind the scenes. With Trump today, it\u2019s almost overt,\u201D Craig said, noting Trump\u2019s direct message in 2016 to Russia to retrieve Clinton\u2019s emails. I noted The Wall Street Journal\u2019s recent article citing Elon Musk\u2019s relationship with Vladimir Putin and secret conversations. We then discussed the volumes of evidence supporting the idea that Trump was recruited as an asset for the KGB in the 1980s. This book is a well researched documented revealing of how American Democracy has been manipulated. Tragic and Americans wil now see what is brought to power.

Unfortunately, we humans seem to have forgotten this, as billions worldwide are literally addicted to our smartphones.

They believe that we, the people, should work towards constant innovation, a technological race to the top, even at the cost of humanity\u2019s future.

      "description": "Dr Phil spoke at Madison Square Garden saying Trump wasnt a bully. Ha! Professor Yamada is an internationally recognized authority on workplace bullying. He is a professor of law and the director of the New Workplace Institute at Suffolk University Law School in Boston. It is the primary drafter of model workplace anti-bullying legislation known as the Healthy Workplace Bill, which is serving as a template for law reform efforts in the U.S. He also is the founding board chairperson of the International Society for Therapeutic Jurisprudence, which promotes the application and design of laws, legal procedures, and legal institutions that support psychological health and well-being. Professor Yamada identifies former President Donald Trump as being a classic workplace bully, constantly resorting to ridicule, name-calling, and cruel putdowns in his public and private behavior. These actions are consistent with some of the worst types of workplace bullying. Drawing from the DSM-V, Trump\u2019s behaviors are often called \u201Ccluster B\u201D traits or behaviors. Cluster B includes narcissism, sociopathy, emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and attention-seeking. It is no wonder that 40 out of 44 former insiders from the Trump White House have now come out in favor of Kamala Harris. The idea of well-being is central to Professor Yamada\u2019s work and the backbone of our discussion in this episode. Professor Yamada\u2019s current work examines how the law, public policy, and dispute resolution procedures can be designed to be more trauma-informed, enhancing the well-being of those impacted by law and public policies. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oAmU7E1zaycPovorrPQ4JJmBtwl_RgRy/view?usp=drive_link Learn more about your ad choices.

Could you or I say \u201Cno\u201D to a toxic leader and courageously defy their commands? This consideration is critical. Leaders don\u2019t operate in isolation. They need political followers who support, amplify, and even challenge their actions. These checks and balances support strong, fair leadership and ensure the political process is just. To Stop a Tyrant is a book approved of by readers at both ends of the political spectrum as it is a non-partisan and evergreen topic. In my interview with Ira Chaleff, author of The Courageous Follower and Intelligent Disobedience: Doing Right When What You\u2019re Told to Do Is Wrong, we explored this multifaceted relationship as he explained how political followers have the power to support healthy leadership or enable authoritarianism. His fascinating perspective comes from a dedicated career of studying the dynamics of leadership and followership \u2013 specifically in political contexts. Together, we unpacked his insights on what he calls \u201CCourageous Followership,\u201D his perspectives on intelligently and ethically disobeying harmful instructions from a leader, and the roles of followers who have the power to combat undue influence.

      "description": "Pornhub was once recognized as the largest and most popular porn site in the world. The site made it easy for users to upload and download content, which is desirable in other contexts. However, these features pose significant threats when applied to freely accessible user-generated, homemade, pornography. Reports suggest that without adequate safeguards, there was a rapid increase in uploads of questionable, illegal, and violent content, including instances of nonconsensual sexual acts. More troublingly, such content became widely viewable and could be downloaded onto private devices. Laila Mickelwait is the author of the new book Takedown: Inside the Fight to Shut Down Pornhub for Child Abuse, Rape, and Sex Trafficking. She is also the founder and CEO of the Justice Defense Fund, a non-profit organization that seeks to help bring justice to survivors of online sexual crimes. Numerous lawsuits have been filed based on sex trafficking, child abuse, and RICO laws in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., with claims that Visa and two hedge funds also knowingly profited from content depicting sexual abuse.

      "description": "In this powerful speech, delivered on September 27th, 2024, Dr. Steven Hassan addresses a gathering of mental health professionals in Washington, D.C., warning the public about the dangerous mental state of Donald Trump. Drawing from his personal experience as a former member of the Moonies cult, Dr. Hassan emphasizes the importance of understanding brainwashing, mind control, and cult behavior. He highlights the dissociative disorder that afflicts Trump and his followers, based on his decades of research and the influence of his mentor, Robert J. Lifton.\n\nDr. Hassan calls for massive psychoeducation and interventions to help those under unethical influence who are trapped in the MAGA cult. He exposes the authoritarian groups controlling Trump, such as Opus Dei and the New Apostolic Reformation, and explains how their manipulation of information leads to mind control. His message urges us to destigmatize and create off-ramps for those caught in these destructive belief systems.\n\nThis speech is a must-watch for anyone concerned about the psychological manipulation at play in politics today.

      "title": "Who Owns Democracy? The Real Deep State and The Struggle Over Class and Caste with Sociologist Charles Derber, PhD",
      "description": "United States history is often portrayed more through myth than historical fact. The true story of America, from its founding rebellion to the present day, is extraordinarily complex. The truth can sometimes seem almost unimaginable due to the numerous injustices and inequities throughout its history. Despite the ideals expressed by the nation\u2019s founders in the Preamble to the Constitution\u2014to form \u201Ca more perfect Union,\u201D establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure liberty for future generations\u2014America\u2019s creation was rooted in systems of class and caste. As discussed in this episode of the Influence Continuum, the idea of a fair system initially created to be accessible to all is an aspect of that founding myth. Charles Derber, a Professor of Sociology at Boston College and life-long activist has authored 28 books on topics such as politics, democracy, fascism, corporations, capitalism, climate change, war, culture wars, and social change. In this episode of the Influence Continuum, he helped us delve deeper into the historical dynamics of class and caste. His latest book, co-authored with Yale R. Magrass, Who Owns Democracy? The Real Deep State and the Struggle Over Class and Caste in America presents a candid discussion about the hard truths of power and who predominantly bears the burden or responsibility of the deep state.

He asked me to speak on the MAGA cult in his new film, #UNTRUTH: The Psychology of Trumpism, which will be streaming on virtually every platform. Dan\u2019s new film highlights what I have been saying for years\u2014Trumpism is not just a political movement; it operates as a destructive authoritarian cult and utilizes known mind-control techniques to disconnect Trump\u2019s followers from reality, reinforce their loyalty to him, and silence dissenters and dissidents. In 2020, he released a film, #UNFIT: The Psychology of Donald Trump, during the 2020 election cycle. The film stars many top people: George Conway, Joe Walsh, Ruth Ben-Ghiat, Malcolm Nance to mention just a few experts. It is really well done and well argued.

The internet is being used as a tool for mind control, influencing our behaviors, thoughts, and emotions by carefully curating the information we are exposed to through complex algorithms that are designed to keep us engaged and scrolling. In this Digital Age, now more than ever, we need to encourage education, media literacy, and critical thinking in order to avoid undue influence and mind control from indoctrinating us and our loved ones.\n\n#drstevenhassan #stevenhassan #cults #mindcontrol #brainwashing \n#BITEmodel #influencecontinuum\n\n********************************************\nLearn more at: https://freedomofmind.com/ \n\nSubscribe to The Influence Continuum podcast: https://freedomofmind.com/podcast-3/ \n\nEnroll in our courses - \nhttps://courses.freedomofmind.com/collections\n\nDownload a .pdf of the BITE model here!\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/cult-mind-control/bite-model/\n\nSubscribe to the Freedom of Mind newsletter: https://freedomofmind.com/subscribe/\n\nRead or listen to Dr. Hassan\u0027s books: https://freedomofmind.com/books/",

      "description": "Have you ever learned from an expert in coercive control? Ever thought about the authoritarianism in a family structure? Maybe you or someone you know were married to a narcissist or knows of children being manipulated by an abusive parent. My latest guest, social worker Christine Cocchiola, is an expert on adult and child victims of coercive control. Dr. Christine Cocchiola has a doctorate in Social Welfare, is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, and is a tenured Social Work professor. Dr. Cocchiola also has a brand-new book with co-author Amy Polacko called Framed: Women in the Family Court Underworld. It consists of 22 stories from survivors of coercive control and narcissistic abuse and what it was like for them and their families dealing with the legal system. Dr. Cocchiola\u0027s work helps combat what I think is an unrealized epidemic, which is people who are harmful and toxic to others. During our talk, we focused on what I believe is vitally important in understanding authoritarian and coercive control when a parent acts like a cult leader.

      "description": "When Kamala Harris was Attorney General for California she supported legislation to protect elderly people from undue influence. In this installment of The Influence Continuum, I sat down with Lisa Nerenberg, MSW, MPH, who has dedicated her career to ensuring dignity and justice for this vulnerable and growing population. Lisa is the founding executive director of The California Elder Justice Coalition. She now serves as the organization\u2019s Director of Special Projects. She co-founded the San Francisco Consortium for Elder Abuse Prevention and the National Network for State Elder Justice Coalitions. Showcasing her passion and expertise, Lisa has authored two influential books: Elder Justice, Ageism, and Elder Abuse (2019) and Elder Abuse Prevention (2008). I believe that undue influence has reached a \u201Ctipping point\u201D where most Americans agree that people can be harmed by psychological means.

I spoke with Walt McKee and J. Larry Mayes, who co-chair the Braver Angels Trustworthy Elections Leadership Team, an organization I am also proud to be a member of. Braver Angels is a unique nonprofit, as it is one of the few organizations that actively brings people together from both sides of the aisle to listen to each other and develop friendships- whether they lean red or lean blue. This year they decided to do a project to determine what everyone could agree on as a fair and trustworthy election. The summary, available to all on the Braver Angels\u0027 website, is reported to consist of \u002223 specific solutions which address seven broad areas of concern,\u0022 including: Fair and Equal Access to Voting Verifiable Voter Identity and Eligibility Transparency and Accountability Redistricting \u2013 Gerrymandering Confidence in Vote Counting Safety and Security in the Elections Process Peaceful Transfer of Power Please come learn about how these recommendations were developed and agreed to by all who lean left or lean right as a way to find common ground together.

      "description": "The November 2024 election will determine the future of America and the free world. Donald Trump has chosen J.D. Vance as his vice president, and the pair continue to get increasingly \u201Cweird,\u201D and lying seems to be ramping up if that is even possible. Conservative attorney George Conway has created the Anti-Psychopath PAC and has publicly called out the media\u2019s failure to explain the dangers of having a psychopath in the White House. Conway wrote the Foreword to the rerelease of The Cult of Trump which is being rolled out asap. We did an Afterword. I wanted to reshare this 2023 interview with one of the leading experts who has been silenced is Bandy X. Lee, M.D., M.Div., a forensic psychiatrist, president of the World Mental Health Coalition, and an internationally recognized expert on violence. A brilliant and compassionate observer of the political landscape, she is the author of Profile of a Nation: Trump\u2019s Mind, America\u2019s Soul and editor of the best-selling book The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 37 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President. She is assembling a team of authors to create a new, short book published by the World Mental Health Coalition and tentatively titled The More Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 37 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Warn Anew.

It features Dr. James Scaminaci\u2019s expertise on psychological warfare and specifically something called Fourth Generation Warfare (4GW). Understanding psychological warfare is imperative to counter the authoritarian agenda aimed at destabilizing people\u2019s sense of self and understanding of \u201Creality.\u201D Indeed, social media and AI are being used to confuse, disorient, and unduly influence people to extremely simplistic positions of all or nothing and good versus evil. The moderate majority that values facts, science, human rights, and checks and balances of power must stay focused on reality being very complex and rarely simple. Going forward, we must understand and protect ourselves in order to keep American from coming apart. Come join us on this fascinating interview.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "With the 2024 election coming in November, Trump has been ramping up his rhetoric about using the DOJ to go after his critics who he considers his enemies. He has managed to enthrall millions to think God is on Trump\u2019s side. All I can say is that no one has experienced more directly the weaponization of the DOJ using former AG William Barr, than Michael Cohen. His book Revenge: How Donald Trump Weaponized the Department of Justice Against His Critics. So I decided to reair our 2023 interview when the book first came out to put some \u201Cflesh on the bones\u201D of this attack on our constitution and rule of law. Michael Cohen hosts the Mea Culpa podcast and authored the #1 best-selling book, Disloyal: A Memoir. His book Revenge is an indictment of Trump weaponizing the Department of Justice, headed by AG Bill Barr. Putting Cohen in jail- solitary confinement for 51 days!

Her insights reveal the critical intersection between human trafficking and mind control, similar to the techniques employed by cult leaders. Empowered Network assists survivors of human trafficking in moving beyond immediate crisis services to achieve long-term stability. I was honored to nominate Felicia Rosario, MD, to get support from the Empowered Network. Felicia was in the Larry Ray cult at Sarah Lawrence that was featured in the Hulu series Stolen Youth. I appeared in the fourth episode, listed under ABC Nightline-Impact Stolen Youth; in that episode, I met Felicia and Daniel Levin, the cult\u2019s whistleblower, and talked with them about their experiences. Larry Ray was convicted of trafficking and is in jail for the rest of his life. I am happy to say Felicia is returning to become a forensic psychiatrist and will attend the IALMH.org congress with me this July 22-26th in Barcelona.

      "description": "Humans crave connection. This need for connection is a vital aspect of the psychology behind cults, coercion, and undue influence. Isolation makes people vulnerable and fearful and more likely to be influenced in harmful ways. Psychiatrist Ravi Chandra discusses the psychology of connection, how institutions can take action to encourage empathy and critical thinking, and how social media and fear-mongering news cycles are creating divisions. We need to be focusing on developing trust and community. As a member of the American Psychiatric Association, Ravi Chandra is concerned about the Goldwater Rule and how it limits what psychiatrists can and cannot say about public figures Like Donald Trump. The APA established the Goldwater rule in 1973. The so-called \u201Crule\u201D says that psychiatrists should not diagnose a person from a distance; they should only offer professional opinions if they have done a personal examination and evaluation. However, forensic experts on dangerousness, like Dr. Bandy X. Lee insists \u201Cexperts have a duty to warn!\u201D When their voices are censored we are all endangered.

      "description": "Did you know there are 8.6 million dedicated members of the Watchtower Society or Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, and supposedly, over 20 million people attend their annual big meeting (memorial attendance) worldwide? They are out on street corners, travel terminals in pairs. When I heard about a new book in Portuguese by a former elder, I wanted to learn more. Ant\u00F3nio\u0027s new book, The Universe of Destructive Sects \u2013 Discover the secret world of deception, manipulation and mind control, explores the deepest secrets of the human mind and uncovers the manipulative techniques behind cults and high-control groups. Ant\u00F3nio Madaleno\u2019s journey from a dedicated Jehovah\u2019s Witness elder to a vocal advocate against the Watchtower Society\u2019s control tactics is a powerful story of courage and resilience. In this week\u2019s episode of The Influence Continuum, we spoke about his transformative story and the impact of his work. Learn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

      "description": "For those who know Combating Cult Mind Control and my work, you know I was in the Moon cult. However, if you are under 50 years old, most people have no idea what the Moonies are about. Allen Tate Wood was a four-year member of the Unification Church\u2013aka The Moon organization. He was the Chief Political Officer of the Unification Church in the United States, commander for the state of Maryland, workshop Director and Chief lecturer for the state of Maryland, and an expert witness for the congressional subcommittee investigation led by Donald Fraser into the Korean CIA infiltration into the United States. He also authored Moonstruck: a memoir of my life and a cult to warn people against cult dangers. Wood said he left in 1973 because \u201Cthey were making people into fanatics.\u201D In addition, he testified in The London Daily Mail lawsuit where the newspaper wrote that the Moonies brainwashed members and separated them from their families. The Daily Mail won the case and the Unification Church had to pay some 2 million dollars. Perhaps most importantly, Wood testified before the US Supreme Court in 1979 and 1981in the case involving Moon\u2019s conviction of conspiracy to defraud the US Government. Mr. Moon was sentenced to 18 months and served 13 in a posh prison in Danbury, Connecticut. Mr. Moon died in 2012, and two sons fight with their mother over billions of dollars. Sean Moon claims to be \u201Cking\u201D and has created a religious cult called the Rod of Iron Ministries. He claims that God wants people to own and know how to use AR-15 assault rifles. Sean Moon went to the January 6th coup attempt at the Capitol and tweeted that Antifa was making the attack- a lie also pushed by Moon\u2019s newspaper, The Washington Times. His brother Justin Moon owns a gun factory in Pennsylvania to make assault rifles and train people for civil wars. After Biden\u2019s inauguration as President of the United States, his predecessor Moon went to the January 6th coup attempt at the Capitol and tweeted that Antifa was making the attack- a lie also pushed by Moon\u2019s newspaper, The Washington Times. Trump, Pence, and Pompeo all appeared for a virtual event for Hak Ja Han, endorsing her. Trump received 2.5 million dollars for this. This was just a few weeks after the attempted violent coup. The Washington Times has been the center of 50 years of climate science denial according to David Lipsky. Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",

Jon and I have been friends and colleagues He is the author of Let\u2019s Sell These People A Piece of Blue Sky, considered the definitive book on Scientology, Dianetics, and L. Ron Hubbard. During our podcast, we discussed the new audiobook versions of Scientology: The Cult of Greed and Opening Our Minds: Avoiding Abusive Relationships and Authoritarian Groups. A significant portion of our discussion focused on the struggle former cult members face in processing the mind control they endured. We consider ourselves \u201Celders\u201D in the work helping people to understand and recover. Yet we both are frustrated that former members fail to see \u201Cthe big picture\u201D and continue to operate out of a cult mindset of \u201Cus vs. them\u201D- even when it comes to fellow ex Scientologists. There is a lot of interesting things we unpack, including the fact that the founder of the cult was a hypnotist. Our conversation delved deeply into the complexities of mind control, the importance of processing and healing from cult experiences, and the challenges former members face in reclaiming their lives.

      "description": "Mike tried to escape Scientology\u2019s undue influence when he was 15. As punishment for trying to escape, he was isolated, sleep-deprived, and forced to do hard labor for over a year and a half. Mike reflects that he felt like a prisoner during this time. Mike finally escaped Scientology at age 27 and joined the military. He had little education and no credit history. Despite these odds, he was inspired by his family\u2019s previous military service and flourished in the Army. Mike became a helicopter pilot and instructor. Mike served five combat tours between Iraq and Afghanistan in his nearly 20 years of service. Mike\u2019s parents joined Scientology when he was seven. Later he says he was made to join the Sea Organization or \u201CSea Org,\u201D a paramilitary section of Scientology. Mike\u2019s mom, Rosemary, worked directly for one of Scientology\u2019s top executives, Ronnie Miscavige Jr., older brother of the organization\u2019s leader, David Miscavige. Mike reflects that the military was less controlling than Scientology for him. Later, Mike rescued his mother from the cult. An utterly fascinating story.

He\u2019s appreciated for his mind-altering sermons, compassionate soul, and social activism. Unitarianism and Unitarian Universalism have traditionally been known as liberal religions, defined by their commitment to individual dignity and freedom of expression. They promote diversity and inclusivity and encourage their members to engage in the \u201Cfree and responsible search for truth and meaning.\u201D However, Todd has had a different experience. He believes the organization has undergone a significant policy change, with the value of autonomy and freedom of expression becoming less valued. As a minister, he was not allowed to discuss his concerns openly and was attacked when he did speak out. As a result, he was \u201Cdisfellowshipped.\u201D Eklof been widely appreciated for his environmental and gay rights activism, in addition to engaging in the areas of criminal justice reform, restorative justice, the peace movement, as well as immigration and racial justice. I wanted to interview him to highight just how polarized Americans have become. I was shocked to hear that he was \u201Ccanceled.\u201D Cancel culture is just not ok- on the right or the left.

      "description": "My guest on this episode of The Influence Continuum is Pamela Ryckman, who wrote the book Candace Pert: Genius, Greed, and Madness in the World of Science. Science and health institutions can mimic cult-like behaviors and dysfunctional systems when the structures within them become overly competitive and focused on limited resources to obtain professional goals. Ideals of collaboration for the good of the public can become crushed under systems of harmful competition and dogmatic attachments to old-fashioned ideas. The life story of Candace Pert, who discovered the opioid receptor, is a clear demonstration of how women and minorities have often been undermined, excluded, or driven out of that system. Virtually unheard of by most, her life work included significant discoveries in mind-body medicine, HIV treatments with Peptide T, and volumes of scientific research and publishing over her time working within the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Mental Health. Pamela Ryckman is an Emmy-winning producer and writer focusing on women in the workforce. She noted how the story of Candace Pert\u2019s life work provided an ideal launchpad to discuss some of the most pressing issues plaguing science and healthcare today. Ryckman is also the author of the book Stiletto Network: Inside the Women\u2019s Power Circles That Are Changing the Face of Business, which discusses the secret society of the world\u2019s most powerful women shaping an underground movement for change. She has written for The New York Times, Financial Times, Washington Post, and many other publications. Join me for this utterly fascinating discussion.

      "description": "Empowering patients or clients to have authority and control over their medical experiences is vital to beneficial therapeutic care. Likewise, well-crafted use of professional communication skills in setting expectations about clinical procedures and outcomes can mean the difference between a traumatic medical visit versus one being remembered with gratitude. Clinical studies show that clinicians trained in hypnotic skills can effectively help patients be more receptive to well-placed suggestions that may help reduce discomfort, eliminate the need for certain medications, lessen the side effects of treatments, and offer moderation over anxiety. Dr. Elvira Lang-Anderson, MD, PhD, is an award-winning interventional radiologist and founder of Comfort Talk\u00AE. This skills-based program fosters improvement of patient satisfaction, optimizing outcomes, and the ability to complete medical procedures through rapid rapport and \u0022word choice\u0022 techniques. She has studied patient/provider interactions and their impact on health outcomes, staff satisfaction, and the results of different techniques on the overall efficiency of healthcare systems.

We first met in the early 90s when he contacted me after reading Combating Cult Mind Control. My book helped him understand how he had been manipulated in the cult using primary BITE model tactics. I have been on his podcast, Deceived, about his experience in the Chung Moo Quan cult. He also has a soon-to-be-published memoir called Deceived: A Journey into Darkness.

      "description": "\u201CAmerica right now needs some exit ramps,\u201D Jason Van Tatenhove said as we discussed his former role as national media director for the Oath Keepers, a group known for its far-right anti-government militia. While Jason would ultimately decide to leave the group in 2016 due to increasing racism and Holocaust denial within their membership, the Oath Keepers would go on to participate in the United States Capitol January 6th attack, led by followers of Donald Trump. Jason eventually testified before a U.S. House Select Committee about his position in media propaganda for the organization. He described their attempts at paramilitary tactics, plans for insurrection, and his relationship with Stewart Rhodes, founder of the Oath Keepers, convicted of seditious conspiracy and evidence tampering. Jason publicly speaks about his concerns for continued paramilitary training groups and recruitment tactics in future election cycles, including the 2024 presidential race. His book, The Perils of Extremism: How I Left the Oath Keepers and Why We Should Be Concerned about a Future Civil War, discusses the unsettled state surrounding extremism in America today and provides an insider view into the tactics used to recruit, train, and further radicalize persons with former military backgrounds, first-responders, and individuals who may otherwise feel disenfranchised by United States Democracy at this time.

      "description": "Hypnosis is everywhere on the Internet- either covertly like ASMR or overtly, where people are enticed to learn hypnosis or NLP, a version of Ericksonian hypnosis. My guest is the lead editor of a comprehensive textbook on clinical hypnosis. Still, it also includes two chapters I co-authored with law professor emeritus Alan Scheflin on the dark side of hypnosis, which includes MK-Ultra. The newly published Routledge International Handbook of Clinical Hypnosis is a compendium of state-of-the-art neuroscience focusing on practice-oriented aspects of clinical hypnosis in healthcare settings. It contains the work of 90 contributors from the global field. Dr. Julie H. Linden, Ph.D., was the lead editor. Julie spoke about the continued increased interest in medicine surrounding clinical hypnotic techniques. We discussed how important and beneficial that could be when prescribing physicians and their ability to offer patients alternatives or integrative therapies for traditional pharmaceutical-based treatment plans, such as pain management.

      "description": "Anthony Davis is a British broadcaster, journalist, and voiceover artist. He was born in London and has been based in Los Angeles since 2017, where he works remotely from his home studio with networks worldwide. Since November 2021, his collaborations with the MeidasTouch media network, including the Five-Minute News, The Weekend Show, and America Uncovered, have exploded his reach across the US as a trusted voice in news commentary. Anthony argues that inviting religious far-right speakers into the very heart of American democracy shows the shift to unionize the right-wing church and state. Anthony feels America fell to a dictator when Trump\u2019s misinformation about the election campaign was spread, and peaceful protestors in Portland were militarized. This erosion of democratic values poses a grave threat to the foundation of American governance, necessitating concerted efforts to safeguard the integrity of democratic institutions and uphold the principles of justice and equality upon which the Constitution was founded. \u0026#xfeff;Learn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

      "description": "Analyzing online content and how people interact with that content is essential to understanding the process of online radicalization. Bad actors worldwide use social media to post content to arouse emotions and create chaos. Distrust and polarization. With algorithms instantly and repeatedly feeding similar content, it is easy to go down a rabbit hole of authoritarian creation, resulting in undue influence. Dr. Stuart Shulman is the founding Editor of the Journal of Information Technology \u0026 Politics. He holds a Ph.D. in American Politics (Oregon 1999) and is currently the founder (2009) and CEO of Texifter, a software business serving academic, commercial, and government clients.

      "description": "The Trump University grift followed the same playbook as many predatory organizations, like Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) organizations. Victims are hooked through legitimate sounding offers, like a weekend sales course for $1,500. However, once the victims attend the weekend sales course, they are pressured into buying more courses for more money to achieve goals too good to be true. It\u2019s a classic bait-and-switch. So, how can regular people receive justice when high-powered people and organizations wield deception and cult-like practices? That\u2019s where Tristan Snell comes in. Snell is a lawyer and legal commentator featured on MSNBC, NPR, in the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal. He served as Assistant Attorney General for New York State, leading the investigation and prosecution of Trump University. Snell has developed a playbook for going up against Trump and others like Trump in court.

      "description": "In this era of political polarization, the landscape in the United States is marked by the rise of Donald Trump as the frontrunner for the Republican nomination in the 2024 presidential election. This despite Trump facing numerous legal challenges\u2013including over his involvement in the January 6th attack on the United States Capitol. However, Trump and his supporters are but the most visible element. The New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) is increasingly taking over the religious right movement and, in turn, influencing the Republican Party, which holds implications for Christianity and the future of democracy. The NAR is closely aligned with those who are on a mission to take over democracy worldwide under the guise of \u201Creligious freedom.\u201D Not only are they backing Trump, but Trump is backing them. This movement of politicized Neo-Charismatic Pentecostals (NCP) seeks to assert dominance through their Seven Mountain Mandate, which we\u2019ve previously discussed. There is a possibility that Trump could once again serve as a conduit for their agenda at the nation\u2019s highest office, amplifying the impact of this cult movement towards religious theocracy through the legislative and judicial branches of government at all levels. The theocratic end goals are clearly laid out through Project Blitz, a state-level legislative program primarily led by NAR operatives. Andr\u00E9 Gagn\u00E9 and Frederick Clarkson returned to my show to discuss the NAR, its background, and ways to educate people worldwide about it.

      "description": "Ne\u015Fe Devenot is a Postdoctoral Associate at the Institute for Research in Sensing (IRiS) at the University of Cincinnati and the Medicine, Society \u0026 Culture Research Fellow at Psymposia. I decided to use the title of her profoundly important journal article for this podcast. Psychedelics are all the rage. When I gave a talk at the American Psychiatric Association, there were many, many talks about the studies being done to see how drugs like psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA might assist psychotherapeutically. However, many people are experimenting on their own. Some get caught up with a malignant narcissist \u201Cshaman\u201D or teacher and experience horrendous trauma and abuse. While the public is doing widespread experimentation, Silicon Valley billionaires reportedly use large quantities of these substances. Devenot points out these tech billionaires appear to believe, in her words, a \u201CTESCREAL bundle of ideologies, which describes an interrelated cluster of belief systems: transhumanism, Extropianism, singularitarianism, cosmism, Rationalism, Effective Altruism, and longtermism.\u201D This is an utterly fascinating discussion about how the super-wealthy promotes these beliefs, and either people follow the leaders or they will be left behind.

      "description": "Natural medicine might seem distant from the far-right fringes of society until you dig a little deeper and find the wealth of \u2018wellness products\u2019 being sold alongside political conspiracies. There is a constant quest for increasing well-being and less \u2018toxic\u2019 lifestyles. Meanwhile, conspiracy theories drain resources and instill fears, including political plots, controls, and cabals. It happens in the extremes on all sides, the quest for health alongside an implanted mission searching for \u201Cthe truth.\u201D Time magazine printed a November 2023 article called Wellness Conspiracy Theories are Spreading and highlighted the topic known colloquially as \u201Cconspirituality.\u201D This leaves people simply seeking to feel better with the additional question of how to recognize scams from reality in holistic and natural health communities. Dr. Melanie Trowbridge is a Licensed Naturopathic Physician and Acupuncturist practicing in Washington State. She and I spoke about the complexity of discernment in natural health communities at this time and about how AI is changing the future of medicine. Her first career was in technology and more recently completed a course at MIT on AI. Melanie also practices separately as an Ordained Spiritual Nature Minister. \uFEFFLearn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

It must be taught and learned by each new generation.\u0022 It is the continuing mission of the iCivics organization and its current Chief Executive Officer, Louise Dub\u00E9, to ensure that future generations of Americans receive meaningful, high-quality, non-partisan civics education through the 145,000 educators and 9 million students in all 50 states served through this free-to-the-public program. Civics education is a cornerstone of learning in the United States. It is the curriculum mortar that helps to hold our democracy together. Students learn the principles of collaboration to form a more perfect union from a very early age in the school system. As they advance in other skills, so should their skills in civics responsibilities and their participatory understanding of the rights and healthy influence within a democratic society. By the time a young person is of voting age in America, we hope that they feel capable of being actively engaged in the formation of societal order. Our nation\u0027s continuation and ongoing commitment to its founding principles depends on the learnings of each successive generation. Join us in this very important interview to insure our future!

This group was established in 1926 and features a power structure like New Apostolic Reformation megachurches. It has been very involved in politics. LDM has been a part of Sochil\u2019s family for four generations, starting with her great-grandmother being brought into the cult in Baja, California, Mexico. With the support of her husband, Sochil managed to escape from LDM and embarked on a journey to seek justice. In 2018, she blew the whistle on the organization to the California Department of Justice, exposing the abuse of leadership on its members and the sexual assault committed by the leader on women and minors. The leader, Naas\u00F3n Joaqu\u00EDn Garc\u00EDa, is currently in state prison and has recently been indicted by the federal government for child pornography. Sochil\u2019s story was shared in the well done HBO docuseries, Unveiled: Surviving La Luz Del Mundo one streaming on MAX.Learn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

In this discussion with historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat, we discuss the subtle and often sinister ways authoritarianism intertwines with the psychological mechanisms of control. We connect the dots from my experiences with cults and coercive persuasion. Ruth Ben-Ghiat is an NYU professor and expert on fascism and authoritarianism, a celebrated author, MSNBC columnist, and consultant, including for del Toro\u2019s Oscar-winning \u2018Pinocchio.\u2019 Her book Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present explores the tactics of illiberal rulers and the history of resistance against them. With a focus on unraveling the complex tapestry of undue influence in modern politics, my discussion with historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat sheds light on the intricate relationship between authoritarianism and its psychological underpinnings.Learn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

      "description": "Human trafficking is defined in international law as the use of fraud, force, or coercion to enslave people. It is a scourge that operates not just through physical coercion but through the devastating use of mind control, a method of psychological enslavement. Rebecca Bender is a courageous survivor and advocate who works tirelessly to empower survivors, train law enforcement, do expert witness work, and assist policymakers. She created the Rebecca Bender Initiative and the online Elevate Academy, which empowers trafficking survivors over the age of eighteen to move forward with their lives. She found encouragement and mentorship from Carissa Phelps and Rachel Thomas, who, with me, developed the Ending the Game ten-session program for trafficking survivors under the age of eighteen. Understanding the tactics traffickers use is critical for prevention, as well as escape and recovery. My discussions with experts and survivors are not just academic; they are practical resources that shine a light on the manipulative strategies used in trafficking. Knowledge of these tactics can be lifesaving for anyone at risk or currently trapped. In this exploration, we delve deep into the intricate web of human trafficking, examining the various manipulative tactics employed by traffickers and the significant role that education and empowerment play in the recovery process.Learn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

If so, you can\u0027t afford to miss this interview with Melanie, a Licensed Clinical Social Worker and a survivor of the infamous Troubled Teen Industry \u2014a largely unregulated web of residential behavior modification programs notorious for subjecting struggling teens to various forms of abuse. Our riveting dialogue focuses on these unregulated behavior modification programs\u0027 stark realities and untold abuses. Melanie\u0027s mission is to raise awareness and educate mental health professionals on coercive control settings like these. Why is this essential? Because desperate parents might unknowingly send their vulnerable teens into a dangerous commercial cult.

      "description": "Growing up in the Assemblies of God, the second-largest Pentecostal denomination in the United States with approximately three million members, Paul Jensen witnessed firsthand the controversial culture and beliefs that define this religious movement. Founded in 1914 and initially considered a fringe group by mainstream Protestant denominations, the Assemblies of God gradually gained acceptance. However, as Paul discovered, this movement\u2019s high-demand and questionable history are often concealed from public scrutiny. He shared his journey of discovery after growing up in the Assemblies of God, the world\u2019s largest denomination of the Pentecostal and Charismatic \u201CSpirit Led\u201D movement. He reveals the little-known authoritarian cult roots of the Assemblies of God and how the church has created an official narrative that conceals its true history. Unfortunately, the protections of law that prohibit religious groups from engaging in supporting political campaigns has been sidestepped in the USA, so understanding the fraud used to control members and their beliefs that they \u201Chear from God\u201D has caused intense polarization with all who do not subscribe to their \u201Ccertainty\u201D of commitment.

Formerly a true believer pundit for the MAGA movement, Rich\u2019s transformation offers a deep dive into the mechanics of belief, mind control, the allure of belonging, and the power of self-reflection and transformation. Rich Logis was a podcaster and deeply committed MAGA activist. His journey resonates with what I\u2019ve observed repeatedly: deceptive recruitment, emotional manipulation, and information control that exploits the deep-seated human need to belong and make a difference. Yet, the moment of awakening and subsequent transformation makes his narrative genuinely captivating. Now, as he says, he\u2019s working to bring good news to the afflicted and to help others leave MAGA and exit the closed system of demonizing all opponents.\nLearn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

      "description": "Large Group Awareness Trainings (LGATs) bill themselves as transformational multi-day workshops. You often feel pressured to attend, perhaps by your corporation or a family member or friend, and you are deliberately not told what will happen there. These workshops often utilize eight to twelve-hour marathon sessions to wear down a person\u0027s identity. According to research by South African Dr. John Hunter, they artificially create bipolar states in participants. Hunter offers a fresh and unique analytical framework to explain the highs people experience at the end of a \u0022training.\u0022 He is a researcher and lecturer based in Johannesburg. His interest in large group awareness trainings \u2013 and their impact on mood and psychosis \u2013 is grounded in his personal experience of bipolar disorder and his participation in an LGAT in 2010. Dr. Hunter put forward the Dopaminergic-Defense Hypothesis, which offers insights into both (i) the \u0022transformational\u0022 experiences associated with LGAT participation and (ii) the common claims of psychological harm and problematic behavior associated with LGAT participation. In 2022, he published an article summarizing the mechanism behind the dopaminergic defense in the Journal for the Cognitive Science of Religion (Hunter, 2022). Hunter and I believe the stress and hyperarousal methods occur in many different environments including authoritarian cults and religious groups. This interview is fascinating.

By engaging in these activities, survivors can tap into their inner strength, process their experiences, and find a sense of empowerment.

      "description": "One of the hottest topics in modern psychology is utilizing psychedelics to aid psychotherapy. Research is being conducted on the potentially beneficial use of substances like psilocybin, LSD, DMT, and MDMA in a controlled environment. In recent years, it\u2019s gotten attention for its efficacy in treating treatment-resistant depression and PTSD, addiction, and end-of-life anxiety. Related to this is the psychedelic underground, a movement that similarly wants to use these substances to improve lives but takes a different, more spiritual approach. I spoke with Rachel Harris, who has experience in both, about this exciting world. Rachel is the author of Swimming in the Sacred: Wisdom from the Psychedelic Underground and Listening to Ayahuasca: New Hope for Depression, Addiction, PTSD, and Anxiety. A psychologist who has been in private practice for 40 years, she spent ten years in an academic research department where she published more than 40 scientific studies in peer-reviewed journals and received a National Institutes of Health New Investigator\u2019s Award.

Katherine grew up on a secluded ranch within the cadet org, Scientology\u2019s Sea Org school for children. At a young age, Katherine began to journal about her day-to-day life, capturing the thoughts and experiences of a child coming of age in a cult. Katherine\u2019s background offers the rare opportunity to tell the story of the hundreds of children who rarely saw their parents and were indoctrinated to become future Sea Org members. The Sea Org is considered the \u201Celite\u201D part of the cult, and members are made to commit to a billion-year contract. In other words, this lifetime and many future lifetimes. Potential Sea Org members take part in both manual labor and indoctrination classes. Katherine\u2019s book is unique because it is told by someone who journaled as a child.

      "description": "I speak with the acclaimed psychiatrist and my mentor, Robert Jay Lifton, M.D., about his new book, Surviving Our Catastrophes: Resilience and Renewal from Hiroshima to the Covid-19 Pandemic. Lifton\u2019s research on thought reform and the psychology of totalism, specifically his study on \u201Cbrainwashing\u201D in China, has been widely regarded as groundbreaking. His book Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism (1961) was used in my deprogramming. It was Lifton who encouraged my career which has spanned 47 years. In this new book, Lifton delves into \u201CSurvivor Power\u201D and the transformation from victimhood to survivorship. He emphasizes the importance of drawing on the knowledge and wisdom gained from surviving traumatic experiences to continue living meaningful lives. The book takes inspiration from historical examples of survivors who have endured unimaginable suffering and trauma. Lifton highlights the remarkable responses of individuals who, in the face of unspeakable horror, have created activist movements, converted their experiences into art and literature, and demonstrated the resilience of the human spirit. From the people of Hiroshima, who responded to the atomic bombing by creating an activist \u201Ccity of peace,\u201D to the survivors of Nazi death camps who combated mass killing and showcased their healing through art and literature, these examples serve as beacons of hope.

Years after she and other mental health experts warned Trump was unfit and a danger to the public, we continue to see vivid proof that the public has suffered by censoring experts! Her recent book is Profile of a Nation: Trump\u2019s Mind, America\u2019s Soul. What was behind the mainstream media silencing of credible experts like Dr. Lee and myself? We discuss this and many important topics like the \u201Cduty to warn\u201D and the importance of mental health, especially in people who are supposed to be public servants. We discuss the 25th Amendment of the Constitution and how it could be bolstered to prevent anyone who is so grossly incompetent from coming to the Presidency again. We also discuss the corrupt and authoritarian family court system in the United States- the subject of a forthcoming book. Learn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

      "description": "Pam is a 70-year-old Boise, Idaho resident, who, while recovering from cancer treatment traveled to Washington, DC and was arrested, charged and sentenced for her connection to the January 6th 2021 attack. Hemphill pled guilty and was sentenced to 60 days in jail, 36 months of probation and fined $500 in restitution. Jack Smith has now announced that Trump has been indicted and faces four counts of Federal charges for his activity regarding the insurrection attempt. Pam Hemphill has been active calling out Trump and the MAGA cult for using her for propaganda on his Truth Social platform. Hemphill chose to plead guilty and has said the Capitol police saved her life from being trampled. I hope many more ex-members will speak up and renounce the Cult of Trump. Pam and I talk about her being harassed since speaking out, strategies for messaging and healing techniques. Join us for this fascinating conversation.

      "description": "Kelvin\u2019s father, Dr. William Pierce, was a notorious white supremacist and founded the National Alliance, a prominent hate group. Dr. Pierce wrote the novel The Turner Diaries, which racists widely cite as inspiration for their racist beliefs and actions. Kelvin was subjected to physical and emotional abuse and was taught to believe that Jews and non-whites were responsible for society\u0027s ills. Despite the personal abuse he suffered, Kelvin accepted his father\u0027s teachings and held onto these racist beliefs as he transitioned into adulthood. It shaped his worldview and interactions with others, even though he didn\u0027t openly broadcast these beliefs.\u00A0Kelvin was able to shed his indoctrination, create the charitable organization \u0022Divine Child Foundation\u0022 to help orphans in Georgia, publish his memoir, and live a life of activism and inspiration in fighting racism and extremism.

      "description": "Gun-related deaths are already over 17,000 as of May of this year. In 2021, they were at their highest ever at almost 50,000 murders, suicides, and accidental deaths involving firearms. These statistics are personal to me due to my experiences in the Moonies cult with the Rod of Iron Ministries, Kahr Arms, the AR15 factory, and two compounds (TN and TX) training people for civil war. I spoke with expert Jonathan Lowy who told me he successfully sued Kahr Arms. Jonathan founded Global Action on Gun Violence, a nonprofit working with the international community to stop gun trafficking and violence through litigation, human rights, and other strategies. He has been litigating and advocating against gun violence for over 25 years. He helped win over $100 million for victims in verdicts and settlements, created the precedent that holds gun companies accountable and reformed dangerous gun industry practices. His articles include \u201CThe Right Not to Be Shot.\u201D He has been named one of the 500 leading lawyers in America for over ten years by Lawdragon magazine.

When allegations of half a century of concealed abuse and criminal actions by Bhajan and his associates came to light in early 2020, which impacted the lives of hundreds of his followers and their children, Els Coenen, Ph.D., felt compelled to stop teaching and promoting kundalini Yoga and wish to help reveal the facts. In 2021, she created the website Abuse in Kundalini Yoga, a platform aimed at exposing and addressing sexual abuse, child abuse, homophobia, exploitation, business fraud, and drugs and arms trafficking within the community. If you have ever seen white-turbaned people calling themselves Sikhs, done yoga, or gone to a workshop, you will be educated about the reality of this billion-dollar corporate empire.

Michelle was raised on a mountain in the Angeles National Forest, where she learned to identify flora and fauna, navigate by the stars, forage for edible plants, and care for the earth. A highly accomplished journalism professor and contributor to many top national publications, she was the 2022 Faculty Lecturer of the Year at Chaffey College. She founded the award-winning literary journal and creative collective, The Chaffey Review, advises Student Media, and teaches poetry and critical thinking in the California Institutions for Men and Women in Chino. Interestingly, former Manson follower Leslie Van Houten assisted her courses for incarcerated women.

Although I am Jewish by faith, I support the principles of Christianity and all major religions that promote truth, peace, love, and forgiveness. Their collaborative work, QAnon, Chaos, and the Cross, is a compendium of essays exploring the rise of conspiracies like QAnon, an online conspiracy group I wrote about in my book, The Cult of Trump. Their book raises awareness about the allures and pitfalls of conspiracy theories and draws upon Christian principles for discerning truth from misinformation and fostering productive dialogues. Anger and fear are potent emotions that tend to override our critical thinking and common sense, sometimes leading to falling out with loved ones who have an opposing view to our own. Accepting a conspiracy theory as fact does not make a person weak, stupid, or gullible. This is an extremely important interview that I believe everyone would benefit from listening to.\n\n********************************************\nLearn more at: https://freedomofmind.com/ \n\nSubscribe to The Influence Continuum podcast: https://freedomofmind.com/podcast-3/ \n\nEnroll in our courses - \nhttps://courses.freedomofmind.com/collections\n\nDownload a .pdf of the BITE model here!\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/cult-mind-control/bite-model/\n\nSubscribe to the Freedom of Mind newsletter: https://freedomofmind.com/subscribe/\n\nRead or listen to Dr. Hassan\u0027s books: https://freedomofmind.com/books/",

      "description": "Dr. Austin and Dr. Bock are accomplished Christian scholars with extensive experience in ethics and philosophy. Although I am Jewish by faith, I support the principles of Christianity and all major religions that promote truth, peace, love, and forgiveness. Their collaborative work, QAnon, Chaos, and the Cross, is a compendium of essays exploring the rise of conspiracies like QAnon, an online conspiracy group I wrote about in my book, The Cult of Trump. Their book raises awareness about the allures and pitfalls of conspiracy theories and draws upon Christian principles for discerning truth from misinformation and fostering productive dialogues. Anger and fear are potent emotions that tend to override our critical thinking and common sense, sometimes leading to falling out with loved ones who have an opposing view to our own. Accepting a conspiracy theory as fact does not make a person weak, stupid, or gullible. This is an extremely important interview that I believe everyone would benefit from listening to.\u00A0 Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",

      "description": "For anyone interested in understanding why religious extremism has such a large influence in America, this fascinating interview focuses on an elite group of Catholic Bishops who oppose the current Pope and his policies of wishing to move the Church away from its abusive authoritarian past. Want to understand more about our current Supreme Court and why they demonstrated that they lied during their confirmation hearings when they said that Roe v. Wade was established law after fifty years. As soon as they had the majority, they showed their true allegiance, and it wasn\u0027t to the law and the majority of the American people. Mary Jo McConahay is a Catholic journalist who takes the position of supporting the changes in Vatican 2, which included allowing the mass to be given in languages other than Latin. Vatican 2 stated categorically that Jews were not Christ-killers but affirmed God is Almighty and that His promise to Abraham was eternal. We discuss the Manhattan Declaration which was signed by Catholics and Protestants to work together to undermine gay rights, and women\u2019s right to choose and to promote the freedom to religious impose their version of religion on all others.

Gaslighting is a devastating form of undue influence. It occurs when an individual manipulates another person by distorting, twisting, and dismissing their experiences, making them question their memories, perceptions, and reality. Gaslighting can occur in a romantic relationship, among family members, in the workplace, within mind control cults as well as by politicians. Robin Stern, Ph.D., has been a practicing psychoanalyst for over thirty years and is the co-founder and associate director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence. She\u2019s the author of The Gaslight Effect and the newly released The Gaslight Effect Recovery Guide.\u00A0 Learn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

However, many of its beliefs and practices fall under my BITE Model of Authoritarian Control, which I developed to evaluate control of Behavior, Information, Thoughts, and Emotions. To gain more insight into this organization, I invited Dr. Steve Daily, a former pastor of the SDA, to share his valuable personal and professional experiences. Dr. Steve Daily is a licensed psychologist, church historian, and accomplished author who has written 28 books, including 11 on Seventh-day Adventism and its founder Ellen G. White. He grew up in an Adventist home and received his education from Adventist institutions. In 2010, Dr. Daily left Adventism and went on to work as a psychologist at UCLA. Since then, he has become an outspoken critic of founder Ellen G. White and the Adventist Church, authoring Ellen G. White A Psychobiography. The book explores whether the accusations of fraud and pathology leveled against her over the years stand up to historical and psychological scrutiny.\u00A0 Learn more about your ad choices.

It is patently abusive by its nature as it is based on submission of one\u2019s own conscience and following directions of a person who is in the \u201Crole of Jesus\u201D over them. Lawsuits are being filed on behalf of those victimized in the cult, some of whom were sexually assaulted in the group and no responsible action was taken. Over one million people have been involved with this group, most of whom have exited. Most have never spoken out about the abuses they experienced- including breaking sessions, excessive pressure to donate money, or the loss of their personal autonomy and sense of self.

Julie Hartman is a Certified Birth Doula, Certified Lactation Counselor, and New Parent Educator. She supports families in the perinatal period through support groups and teaching classes on living with a newborn. Most importantly, she is the mom of three adult children and can connect with the people she works with through shared experiences. We discuss what a doula and lactation counselor is, as many people are unaware. Julie tells us a birth doula is often confused with a midwife, but they are different. Whereas the role of a midwife requires formal medical training, birth doulas support the family before, during, and after birth. They assist the family in empowering and speaking up for themselves so that they can advocate for their needs in the birthing process. Birth Doulas also help educate families on the decisions that could need to be made during a hospital birth so there are no surprises and families can think those options through before they are in the heat of the moment. Julie shares her expertise in ethical, positive parenting techniques. Learn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

      "description": "Rachel Maddow\u2019s podcast, Ultra, is about Nazism in the United States in the 1930s and 1940s. She based her podcast on the scholarly work of a Jesuit historian Professor Charles R. Gallagher, and his award-winning book.\u00A0I was fascinated to learn more and discovered that he teaches at nearby Boston College. So we met for lunch, and he kindly consented to this fascinating interview. I learned that the Nazis sent agents such as Charles Scholtz to Boston to recruit and radicalize Americans. These agents wanted to prevent the United States from coming to the defense of the United Kingdom and other European countries. The Nazis did not want America to help Jews who were persecuted and exterminated. Father Charles Coughlin was a Roman Catholic priest and radio personality with a listenership of 30 million people. He was a vocal supporter of the Christian Front. He praised Hitler\u2019s efforts to combat communism and advocated for a similar approach in the United States. Coughlin also used his radio broadcasts to spread anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and to attack Jewish people and Jewish-owned businesses. Coughlin also supported fascist regimes in Europe. In the 1940s, Coughlin and some of his followers began to plot a violent coup to overthrow the US government. The Nazis are still actively promoting violent fascism.

Having interviewed over 10,000 members of Gen Z, she provides invaluable insights into what the next decade and beyond will bring. The digital age has brought about a massive change in the way we think, feel, communicate, and behave. For young people born and raised in a digital world, being online for an average of eleven hours a day affects not only their brain development, such as shortened attention span, ability to concentrate, social skills, and mental well-being. As well as this, young people\u2019s need for connection and belonging is being exploited by unhealthy \u2018influencers\u2019 online, who are using the internet to indoctrinate and radicalize them.

A 6th generation member, he was excommunicated from the Church of Latter Day Saints (LDS) for speaking up about gay rights and the suicide problem within the LDS church. They didn\u0027t like him raising those issues, but he persevered and is now helping others find their way out of religious faith crises and transition to a free life. Dr. Dehlin holds a master\u0027s degree in instructional technology and a Ph.D. in Clinical and Counseling Psychology. His interests revolve around the nexus of religion and mental health, emphasizing navigating religious faith crises and LGBTQ religious identity conflict. He is the CEO of the Open Stories Foundation. Yes, The BITE Model fits the LDS Church. The FLDS is much more destructive and extreme on the Influence Continuum. This is a blockbuster interview!

He has spent years researching cases of what doctors call \u201Cspontaneous remission\u201D and what others call \u201Cmiracles.\u201D We discuss the terribly broken medical care system that fails to see a whole person rather than a set of symptoms or diseases in \u201Csilos.\u201D He talks about specific scientifically validated cases where people were given a terminal diagnosis and yet, lived.

      "description": "Please join me in a profound but disturbingly honest conversation with one of the world\u2019s true experts in Artificial Intelligence. The Information Professionals Association (IPA) co-founder, Dr. Rand Waltzman, has over 40 years of experience performing and managing research in AI applied to domains including social media and cognitive security in the information environment. His distinguished career includes being the former Deputy Chief Technology Officer and Senior Information Scientist at the Rand Corporation. His perspective is dire. He says that without dramatic intervention into data privacy and technology regulations worldwide, those with power will be able to conduct massive mind control at scale, as we see in current dictatorships. He agrees that the human mind is easily manipulated, provided a person doesn\u2019t understand how social psychology principles and propaganda techniques are being used on them. There is no freedom without responsibility. Virtual Reality (VR) technology is able to obtain vast amounts of information about a user\u2019s mind that can be used to manipulate and control them.

In this fascinating conversation, Natan shares his spiritual journey, which eventually led him to become a rabbi, educator, and environmental activist.

Augustine reports on the pervasive culture of white-collar criminality and financial scams within Scientology perpetrated by its members, in addition to Scientology\u0027s cover-ups or rapes and child molestation. He is a former Pentecostal who has researched Massimo Introvigne, head of Cesnur.org, and outs him as a cult propagandist along with a host of other sociologists who say brainwashing does not exist and don\u0027t trust former members or critics.

He is a former Army Captain and rising political star\u2013yes, he was invited to the White House to meet with President Obama, who encouraged him to run for President.

Most of these fulfill the BITE model of Authoritarian Control criteria. Some of these folks see themselves as \u201Cspiritual warriors\u201D and are convinced other people who wish to have human rights (women who wish to have control of their bodies, gay marriage, and reject theocracy) are satanic/ demonic forces. Dr. Andr\u00E9 Gagn\u00E9, professor in theological studies at Concordia University (Montr\u00E9al) teams up for this interview with Frederick Clarkson, Senior Research Analyst at Political Research Associates who has been reporting on the rise of the theocratic Christian Right for four decades.

Sarma co-founded Pure Food and Wine restaurant in NYC and founded the raw vegan brand, One Lucky Duck. The series failed utterly by not explaining how predators operate, or how hypnosis can be used to elicit obedience and induce amnesia. In this case, large sums were drained from Sarma\u0027s business, and both she and her predator were jailed at Rikers Island, prosecuted as if both had criminal intent. This episode is for anyone wishing to understand how an educated, intelligent woman\u0027s business and life were obliterated via years-long grooming and mind control.

      "description": "Proposing a New Model to Conduct a Forensic Evaluation of Undue Influence - presented by Steven Hassan, PhD.\n\nThe DSM-5 identifies this group of patients under a special category: Other Specified Dissociative Disorder 300.15 (F44.9). \u201CIdentity disturbance due to prolonged and intense coercive persuasion: Individuals who have been subjected to intense coercive persuasion (e.g., brainwashing, thought reform, indoctrination while captive, torture, long-term political imprisonment, recruitment by sects/cults or by terror organizations) may present with prolonged changes in, or conscious questioning of, their identity.\u201D However, there is no established, formal process to perform a forensic evaluation on the process of predatory influence. The 500-year-old concept of Undue Influence has been narrowly defined around a subject\u2019s competency to designate who will inherit wealth and property. The \u201Crational agent\u201D model that dominates the world legal perspective on human behavior is sadly outdated by scientific research. For example, brain maturity is now believed to be 25 years of age and not 18 or even 21. The Social Influence Model developed by Alan Scheflin will be presented as well as the Influence Continuum and BITE model. Specific suggestions for developing a twenty-first century forensic evaluation for undue influence will be presented. Multiple real-life examples will be analyzed which include destructive cults, sex trafficking, and testamentary capacity.\n\n********************************************\nLearn more at: https://freedomofmind.com/ \n\nSubscribe to The Influence Continuum podcast: https://freedomofmind.com/podcast-3/ \n\nEnroll in the online course, Understanding Cults: The Basics: https://freedomofmind.com/online-course-understanding-cults-the-basics/ \n\nSubscribe to the Freedom of Mind newsletter: https://freedomofmind.com/subscribe/\n\nRead or listen to Dr. Hassan\u0027s books: https://freedomofmind.com/books/",

      "description": "The Need to Update the Law\r Regarding Undue Influence\nSteven Hassan, PhD\nThomas Gutheil, MD\nBarry Roth, MD\n\nIn British law, undue influence is a 500-year-old legal concept. Currently, Testamentary Capacity has a very low standard of competency and does not consider modern knowledge about hypnosis, social influence, or characteristics of predatory individuals and organizations. Several cases that show how social influence can be used to subvert an adult\u2019s capacity to give informed consent will be discussed in this presentation. One involves a case of a divorce attorney, Michael Fine, who was covertly hypnotizing his female clients to have sex with him and giving amnesia to his victims, so they could not report the crime. Another case involves a 21-year-old man who was recruited into a destructive cult and who gave his inheritance to the cult guru. Two models will be presented which might be useful to begin to frame how the legal system should be looking at Undue Influence. The first is an Influence Continuum which goes from ethical, healthy influence on one end to unethical destructive mind control on the other end. The second is the BITE model of unethical mind control which uses four overlapping components: Behavior Control, Information Control, Thought Control, and Emotional Control to begin to evaluate where on the continuum any particular case may be. These cases and their implications will be discussed in this presentation.\n\nFreedom of Mind as a Human Rights Principle\nMatthew Bywater, MSc\n\nFreedom of mind remains largely unknown as a concept in popular parlance, particularly compared to conventional notions such as freedom of speech and freedom of belief. National legal systems have traditionally neglected issues of psychological coercion. In the texts of the various international human rights documents, nowhere is freedom of mind cited explicitly. In today\u2019s world, the need for stronger and more explicit protection for the mind is urgent, and efforts to promote freedom of mind must take place at a national and international level. Equally important is the need for a popular understanding of just what exactly is \u201Cfreedom of mind\u201D; individuals need to know what a right constitutes if they are to make a claim for that right. This presentation presents some definitions of freedom of mind and potential obstacles to its popularization, explores the existing elements of freedom of mind already present in international human rights documents, and discusses how to afford freedom of mind a firmer footing in international law, including the possibility of submitting a Declaration of Freedom of Mind to the United Nations. The IALMH Congress presents an opportunity to elicit ideas on how to advance freedom of mind as a human rights principle. \n\n********************************************\nLearn more at: https://freedomofmind.com/ \n\nSubscribe to The Influence Continuum podcast: https://freedomofmind.com/podcast-3/ \n\nEnroll in the online course, Understanding Cults: The Basics: https://freedomofmind.com/online-course-understanding-cults-the-basics/ \n\nSubscribe to the Freedom of Mind newsletter: https://freedomofmind.com/subscribe/\n\nRead or listen to Dr. Hassan\u0027s books: https://freedomofmind.com/books/",

John helps us realize an essential part of American authoritarianism which to this day has an international following. By freeing himself from the mental and emotional damage he suffered as a child growing up in that atmosphere, he can help millions realize they were following a false prophet, believing they are just being \u201CChristian.\u201D There is a growing movement of people realizing it was really about power, money, sex and politics, and not religion.

      "description": "A tweet thread I wrote about Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019s wife Ginni went VIRAL two days ago. I shared a video from 1986 few people have seen from a conference for former cult members. Ginni Thomas spoke in this video about her past experience in a cult. Ginni later went on to do a great deal of anti-cult work, but as is the case with so many former members, she joined a new authoritarian cult (The Cult of Trump). Steve is interviewed by Freedom of Mind\u2019s own Dan McCollister about the issues surrounding Ginni Thomas.

Ginni Lamp married Clarence Thomas in 1987 and then officially became Ginni Thomas. I apologize for not clarifying that previously. Many of the major former member activists speak at this meeting including Joe Szimhart, Paul Martin, Carol Giambalvo and more. It was a time in history where it was 10 years from the Jonestown assassination of Congressman Leo J. Ryan and murder of over 900 Americans (over 300 were children).

      "description": "Dr. Bandy Lee is a forensic psychiatrist and a renowned expert on violence. Dr. Lee taught at Yale and Yale Law School from 2003-2020 and became known to the public by leading a group of mental health experts in breaking the silence about the dangerous mental impairments of Donald Trump. She edited the book \u201CThe Dangerous Case of Donald Trump,\u201D with 37 experts weighing in on their concerns about Trump. She\u2019s been heavily censored in the media due to the American Psychiatric Association citing \u201CThe Goldwater Rule\u201D, but they are a private institution and have power only over their members. Dr. Lee is not a member. Nevertheless, Dr. Lee believes that all medical professionals have a \u201Cduty to warn.\u201D In this fascinating conversation, we talk about a wide range of topics. She too believes that trained mental health professionals are a valued resource in the media and are not called on to help the public enough.

MOVE was a \u201Cleft\u201D wing, revolutionary authoritarian group. Conflicts between MOVE members and the Philadelphia Police Department had been frequent, but that evening this conflict erupted into tragedy. The City of Philadelphia dropped a satchel bomb onto the roof of the residence which burst into flames and was allowed to burn without any attempt to put out the fire or rescue the inhabitants. Eleven people died in the fire, including five children. Sixty-one homes in the neighborhood were destroyed and hundreds of people were left homeless.\n\n********************************************\nhttps://leavingmove2021.blogspot.com/\nLearn more at:\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/\n\nSubscribe:\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/subscribe/\n\nLeading Scientific Research on Undue Influence, its Effects and the Law:\nhttps://freedomfromundueinfluence.org/",

Chris Lee, recruited while a student at MIT, is a graduate of Gordon- Conwell Seminary and holds a Pastor credential.

During the standoff, I watched in horror as I saw one mishandling and after another. I even went to my congressman at the time, Joe Kennedy, and asked him to please ask the FBI to consult with me, but they were too busy \u0022handling it.\u0022 After many days went by, I started going to the media to talk about how I believed many of the tactics the FBI was using were counterproductive.\n\nI had information from individuals who had loved ones inside the compound and was more than horrified that they decided to assault the compound with gas. I knew it would go up in flames.\n\nAfter the tragedy, Attorney General Reno, said publicly that they would research into what happened, so they could learn from their mistakes. After waiting years, I decided to do this talk and just say publicly what I felt was appropriate. Regrettably, there is more information that is confidential which will never be told.\n\nA few years ago, I happened to me Byron Sage, the lead negotiator for the FBI for the Branch Davidians debacle. He was interested in reading Combating Cult Mind Control and FReedom of Mind. We later talked and he said that he really liked my books and had wished he had known me during the standoff. He said he regretted the religious studies scholars he was depending on.\n\n********************************************\nLearn more at:\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/\n\nSubscribe:\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/subscribe/\n\nLeading Scientific Research on Undue Influence, its Effects, and the Law:\nhttps://freedomfromundueinfluence.org/",

Last year, I wrote a blog about this tragedy and how it forever changed me: Jonestown and the Mind Control Cult of Jim Jones: A Survivor\u2019s Story. Most of the people who died were members of the People\u2019s Temple, led by cult leader Jim Jones. When many think of this tragedy, brainwashing and mind control is the lesson to remember. People were programmed to do what Jones told them to do as they widely believed him to be God\u2019s authority on earth.\n\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/ex-maga-troll-david-weissman-gives-interview-about-his-process-of-realizing-that-facts-matter/",

The Moon organization sunk an estimated $2 billion into a newspaper in Washington D.C. in order to advance its influence and power among conservatives. The group later tried to whitewash it, but here is actually what they said. The Moon organization also owns UPI and had a huge Television influence at this time in Washington D.C.. \nTop Moonie leader Michael Warder,  was a Director of the Unification Church of America in 1977. He was listed as Director of Tong II in 1978, and was the largest American stockholder of Tong II Enterprises in the 1970\u2019s. He was Secretary of the International Cultural Foundation. He had an editorial position in News World Communications which published the UC New York newspaper, \u2018The News World\u2019 \u2013 later called \u2018The New York Tribune\u2019. It closed in 1991.\n\nSun Myung Moon was a convicted felon and served 13 months in Federal penitentiary. His wife has taken over the group and the current name is Family Federation for World Peace and Unification.\n\n*****************************************************************\nContact Freedom of Mind to schedule a consultation or to learn about offered services.\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/contact/\n\nLearn about how the Strategic Interactive Approach can help rescue your friend or loved one out from under predatory influence.\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/strategic-interaction-approach-sia-frequently-asked-questions-faq/\n\nSubscribe to receive updates on news, events, blogs, videos, webinars, and workshops.\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/subscribe/\n\nLearn about my not-for-profit and scientific research on undue influence, its effects, and the law.\nhttp://freedomfromundueinfluence.org/",

      "description": "Published on Aug 14, 2018\n\nDestructive influencers are using the internet to deceptively recruit people using deception, manipulation, hypnotic and subliminal programming and more. Hassan\u0027s Influence Continuum is a new model that describes healthy, ethical influence on one end and destructive unethical influence on the other. The BITE model (Behavior Control, Information Control, Thought Control and Emotion Control) has been helping people understand and leave totalist relationships and destructive cults for decades.  \n\n\nSteven Hassan M.Ed. LMHC, NCC (pronounced HASS-en), is an expert on Undue Influence, brainwashing and unethical hypnosis and author of the best-selling book, Combating Cult Mind Control.\n\nFor over forty years, he has helped thousands of individuals and families recover from undue influence (mind control). With over 40 years of experience, he is sought after as one of the foremost authorities on undue influence, brainwashing, deprogramming and controlling groups and individuals. Steve understands the subject from a unique perspective as both a former cult member and as a clinical professional.\n\nSteven is the Founding Director of the Freedom of Mind Resource Center, a coaching, consulting, and training organization dedicated to supporting individuals to have the freedom to think clearly and to freely consider how they want to live their lives. Steven pioneered a breakthrough method called the Strategic Interactive Approach (SIA), an effective and legal intervention alternative for families to help cult members. The SIA teaches family and friends how to strategically influence the individual involved in the cult.\n\nHe is the author of Combating Cult Mind Control: The #1 Best Selling Guide to Protection, Rescue, and Recovery from Destructive Cults (1988, 1990, 2015), Releasing the Bonds: Empowering People to Think for Themselves (2000) and Freedom of Mind: Helping Loved Ones Leave Controlling People, Cults \u0026 Beliefs (2012, 2013).  He is also the co-developer of Ending the Game, a non-coercive curriculum designed to educate and empower sex trafficking victims to leave pimps and traffickers. Steven provides training workshops and seminars for mental health professionals, educators, and law enforcement officers worldwide, as well as for families of cult members. He writes and speaks out about the importance of viewing ISIS/Daesh and other terrorist groups as destructive cults. Steve has appeared on innumerable television and radio shows. Newspapers, magazines and other media all over the world have quoted Steve Hassan extensively.\n\nSteven is currently pursuing a doctorate at Fielding University to do quantitative research on the factors of control that characterize undue influence. He is an active member of the Program in Psychiatry and the Law, a Harvard think tank of forensic experts. Dr. Michael Commons, research director for the program, has invited Steven to create a division Freedom from Undue Influence in order to help facilitate this research.\n\nSince his own deprogramming from the Moon cult in 1976, Steven has appeared on innumerable television and radio shows. Newspapers, magazines and other media all over the world have sought his expertise. Steven\u2019s work has received praise from academic luminaries such as Robert Jay Lifton, Philip Zimbardo, Robert Cialdini, Anthony Pratkanis as well as clinical experts such as Daniel Brown, Judith Herman, Mary McCarthy and others. Steven taught Psychiatry Grand Rounds at Harvard Medical School in October 2017 and has been teaching 4th-year psychiatry residents at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital for 17 years.

I knew it would go up in flames. \n\nAfter the tragedy, Attorney General Reno, said publicly that they would research into what happened so they could learn from their mistakes. After waiting years, I decided to do this talk and just say publicly what I felt was appropriate. Regrettably, there is more information that is confidential which will never be told. \n\nMy website is freedomofmind.com.",

      "description": "On May 6, 1991, TIME Magazine did a cover story on Scientology: the Cult of Greed and this Geraldo show was taped a few weeks afterward with Steven Hassan \u0026 then President of the U.S. Church of Scientology, Heber Jentzsch. The text of the Time magazine can be seen here - content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,156952,00.html. Scientology sued Time magazine but lost the efforts to suppress the correct information contained therein, including OT3. Heber Jentzsch, a former Mormon before getting recruited into Scientology, is reportedly in \u0022The Hole.\u0022 Karen De la Carriere, one the highest trained auditors in the cult, was, I believe married to Heber during this taping. Karen is an outspoken activist against the cult, especially so when her son Alexander died due to medical neglect. She was not even informed of his illness (that I believe modern medicine could have cured) as well as his death. Karen did a number of Youtubes about Heber, the first is here youtube.com/watch?v=VkEmstHbKIU\nMy recollection of taping the show was that I felt angry and betrayed by the producers and Geraldo himself because I had been asked to be on the show about Scientology and as soon as the segment you see ended, I was forced off the set into a back room and was told the rest of the show was on Prozac- this came from left field for me and my presumption is that somehow Scientology had persuaded Geraldo to do the second part on prozac- to divert attention from the TIME article- and of course, not have me there to criticize the cult. After that experience with Geraldo (I had been on his show twice earlier) I refused all invitations to do shows with him.",

      "description": "This video is about Masoud Banisadrin this video Steven Hassan and Masoud Banisadr discuss IS and Masoud\u0027s newest book Destructive and Terrorist Cults (2015).\nMasoud Banisadr knows cults. The son of a prominent Iranian family, he began his radical political activities in 1978 while pursuing his postgraduate studies in England. The group he affiliated with was the Mojahedin-e Khalq (MeK), a group that played a prominent role in the mass demonstrations and paramilitary activity that led to the 1979 overthrow of the Shah. At first, to recruit new members, MeK supported Ayatollah Khomeini and the new establishment. But, on 20th June 1981, it organized a failed uprising to overthrow the government. Thereafter, MeK changed into a clandestine terrorist group and MeK\u2019s leader, Rajavi, along with many high-ranking members, escaped to France. However, Rajavi, having failed to achieve any of his objectives, underwent a radical transition to become a cult leader. Members of his group gradually surrendered all their powers of independent thinking to his growing megalomania. By the late 1980s, under Rajavi\u2019s \u2018Ideological Revolution\u2019, MeK members were compelled to divorce their spouses and abandon their children as well. In 1986, Banisadr became the representative for MeK to UN agencies and human rights organizations, and later their representative in the United States, an unofficial ambassador of the MeK. In 1996, Banisadr woke up, as if from a bad dream, and decided to defect. He was one of the fortunate ones who managed to find a way out. By then, most members of MeK were living in camps in Iraq, collaborating with the government of Saddam Hussein against their own country, Iran. In these camps, the cult leader, Masoud Rajavi and his wife Maryam Rajavi, created their imitation of Iran, complete with a pseudo-parliament and a replica of the Tehran bazaar. And all the members were transformed into devoted, unquestioning servants. Fortunately, Masoud Banisadr was able to leave the cult and regain the intellectual and spiritual freedom that he had forfeited for eighteen years. Through intensive scholarly study and his personal experiences of the cult phenomenon in all its manifestations, Banisadr has created a work of enduring value\u2014a gripping portrayal of the dynamics\nSteven Hassan is a former cult member who has been educating the public about mind control and destructive cults since 1976. As a Nationally Certified Counselor (NCC) and Licensed Mental Health Counselor (LMHC), Hassan is the author three books that have received extensive praise from former cult members, families of former members, clergy, cult experts, and psychologists.Combatting Cult Mind Control: The #1 Best Selling Guide to Protection, Rescue, and Recovery from Destructive Cults (1988), Releasing the Bonds: Empowering People to Think for Themselves(2000), and in July 2012, he published the paperback and e-book, Freedom of Mind: Helping Loved Ones Leave Controlling People, Cults \u0026 Beliefs, Second Edition 2013.

One chapter was on the Moon cult and I was asked to supply much of the information on that chapter. Steve was a great supporter of my work. When he was asked to fill in for the Sonya Live show, he asked me to do the interview to help promote the hardback edition which was released on the 10th anniversary of the Jonestown tragedy- November 18th 1878.\nCombatting (two \u0022t\u0022s) Cult Mind Control was published in hardback with a simply atrocious cover of the author\u0027s objections, before it was re-released in paperback in 1990. During the PR tour for the book, Hassan tried using contact lenses, but he never felt comfortable wearing them. In this interview, callers ask about Scientology, the Children of God and more. in 2014, Hassan bought back the rights to his own book, and substantially updated the book to the Internet generation and includes terrorist cults, human trafficking, much more on mind control and undue influence methods, updated his approach to helping those deceptively recruited into cults and much more. For those who have read the original and the new volume, they say the new book is SO much better.",

      "description": "This talk was sponsored by The Secular Society of MIT as the last one in a series (ssomit.mit.edu/) and was scheduled months before the Boston Marathon Bombings.\nThe speakers before me in the series were:\nSteve Pinker on the evolutionary psychology of religion\nJonathan Lane on early childhood perceptions of the supernatural\nCatherin Caldwell-Harris on the psychology of nonbelief\nMonroe Butler on the neurology of religiosity\nWhen the two bombers were identified, people who knew Dzhokhar Tsarnaev were in total disbelief that he could be involved in such a despicable terrorist act as they knew him to be a kind, intelligent, warm, socially connected person. He was Captain of the wrestling team, graduate of Cambridge Ridge and Latin High School, who liked to party and had many friends. The big question in the media was: whether or not he could have been brainwashed. Immediately the suspicion was that his 7 yr older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who had converted and became a more religious Muslim might have exercised undue influence over not only his brother but Katherine Russell, the woman he married. She dropped out of college, abandoned her life goals, converted to Islam and reportedly worked 70-80 hours to support Tamerlan and their young child.\nI appeared on CNN, FOX PBS, NPR and other shows to discuss the possibility that maybe Tamerlan had been the subject of radicalization through undue influence tactics, and then influenced his brother and wife. Due to the lack of facts, my comments were based solely on my own cult experience in the 1970s and my 36 years of experience dealing with people who have experienced radical personality change due to mind control techniques described in the BITE model. The students and faculty present were particularly interested in me describing recruitment and indoctrination techniques.",

Do you know anybody that does not serve Jehovah? Then let them know they will die.\u201D These are some of the fear beliefs the Watchtower Society teaches its members.\nSteve Hassan and Gregorio Smith do questions and answers after the film.\n-Excerpt from TRUTH BE TOLD\nNEW YORK, NY \u2013 May 6, 2013 - SMITHKRAFT PRODUCTIONS, LLC announced a Brookline, MA promotional screening of TRUTH BE TOLD.

There will be a Q\u0026A session with director Gregorio Smith after the screening. Invited guests include noted author, cult expert and mental health counselor Steven Hassan.\nABOUT THE FILM\nTRUTH BE TOLD - a new feature-length documentary - lifts the veil on the seemingly benign Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses religion to expose a profit-driven, isolationist culture characterized by fear, totalitarian corporate leadership, intellectual \u0026 spiritual intimidation, suspension of critical thinking, failed prophecies, doctrinal inconsistency and improper handling of physical and sexual abuse allegations within the church.\nSee former Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses candidly discuss growing up inside the religion. They reveal experiences including the effects of proselytizing door-to-door, shunning non- observant family and friends, suffering the discouragement of pursuing dreams like gaining a higher education, missing other societal holidays and customs. And more...\nUltimately the film reveals why Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses have the lowest retention rate of any religion with only 37% of those raised as Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses continuing their affiliation with the religion.\nThis expos\u00E9 - the title of which refers to the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses\u2019 perception that their beliefs are \u0027the truth\u0027 - is the first feature-film directed by Gregorio Smith.\n[MORE]\nPage |2 Trailers, excerpts, production stills and other content are available on the official TRUTH\nBE TOLD website: hereliesthetruth.com\nTRUTH BE TOLD on Facebook: facebook.com/hereliesthetruth VENUE INFO\nWidely regarded as one of New England\u2019s most beloved cultural landmarks, the Coolidge Corner Theatre is one of the nation\u2019s most prominent independently operated movie theatres, run by the not-for-profit Coolidge Corner Theatre Foundation.\nThe Coolidge Corner Theatre is fully accessible and is located at 290 Harvard Street in the heart of Coolidge Corner, Brookline, Massachusetts (4 miles from Boston).\nVisit coolidge.org to purchase tickets and box office information.

      "description": "Kim Meyer, \u201CEx-World Wide Church of God\u201D member, PCC-S, LICDC-CS, is now a licensed Professional Clinical Counselor and Independently Licensed Substance Abuse counselor and Director of Campus Outpatient and Alcohol and Other Drug Services at Beech Brook in Cleveland Ohio. Her husband Bill, also an ex-member of the WCG, was interviewed too by Steve Hassan while he was in Cleveland as the keynote speaker at the Human Trafficking Symposium co-sponsored by Beech Brook and the Rene Jones Empowerment Center on January 10, 2014. Kim grew up in the WCG from the age of eight, exiting in the mid 90\u2019s after 30 years. She and her husband raised 3 children while in the church, all of whom are no longer affiliated with the WCG. \nIn her role at Beech Brook, Kim oversees the psychotherapeutic treatment of 70 Residential children with severe mental health disorders including trauma resulting from Human Trafficking experiences. She feels it is vital that Mental Health professionals treating the trafficked adolescent or adult have a working knowledge of destructive influence, coercion and mind control to adequately address the relationship trauma experienced by the trafficked victim. Kim also maintains a private practice working with those who are contemplating leaving their groups, or have left and need someone who can relate to their experience while providing therapeutic support. As a trauma trained clinician she draws on several treatment models which inform her practice including Steve Hassan\u2019s Strategic Interaction Approach and BITE model, as well as the Lifton and Singer models of understanding cultic mind control. She along with Steve, Rachel Thomas and Christine Marie Katas will be participating in a workshop at the International Cultic Studies Conference (ICSA) in July in Washington D.C. looking at the topic of Human Trafficking and the Cult/Mind Control phenomenon. Kim can be reached at meyerkim@roadrunner.com.\n\nRev. Bill Meyer is a former member of the World Wide Church of God. He joined the group on his own as a sixteen year old in the mid 1960\u2019s. He became a lay pastor who planted and pastored a WCG congregation in Northeast Ohio in the mid 1990\u2019s. When he resigned and quit the WCG after about two years \u2013 and explained why to the congregation \u2013 it also voted to exit the WCG. To avoid just replicating the old system in new clothes, the congregation joined the mainline Protestant Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Meyer, a graduate of the Worldwide Church of God\u2019s former Ambassador College, Ohio State University and Ashland Theological Seminary, was later ordained by the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and has partner status in the United Church of Christ. He has pastored Disciple of Christ, UCC and Presbyterian Church USA congregations part time. He works full time as an editor for the Cleveland Plain Dealer and is also an Ohio licensed Professional Counselor. Bill can be reached at williamdmeyer@msn.com.\nWCG is now known (and has been for sometime) as Grace Communion International (GCI).",

CAST\u2019s mission is to assist persons trafficked for the purpose of forced labor and slavery-like practices and to work toward ending all instances of such human rights violations. CAST\u2019s trafficking cases are recognized nationally and internationally and serve as a best-practice model of inter-agency collaboration and empowerment of survivors. The program is known best for its success in assisting survivors in their journey from being victims of trafficking to becoming self-sufficient, thriving members of the communities in which they live. These services include access to food, shelter, job training, intensive case management, legal assistance, mental health and wellness, alternative non-western healing therapies, education, and life skills training. CAST\u2019s emergency response program also includes a 24-hour hotline (888-539-2373) to receive information on potential trafficking cases from all members of the community, including victims themselves. CAST also has a survivor leadership and advocacy program, which includes a Survivor Leadership and Advisory Caucus. Through the caucus, survivors who have graduated from the CAST program become leaders and advocates and strengthen the CAST survivor community. CAST empowers victims of trafficking and modern-day slavery to become survivors and leaders. Their web site is castla.org.",

      "description": "Along with an infectious laugh and a soulful voice, Rabbi Moshe Waldoks \u2014 Reb Moshe \u2014 brings many years of deep and eclectic experiences to his role as Temple Beth Zion\u2019s spiritual leader. Educated in a Yiddish-speaking yeshiva and holding a doctorate in Jewish intellectual history, Reb Moshe taught at Wellesley, Hebrew College and Brandeis before receiving smicha, or post-denominational ordination, by his mentors, Rabbis Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, Arthur Green and Everett Gendler.\nAlthough grounded in the wisdom of these remarkable rabbis, Reb Moshe is temperamentally inclined to experiment. For example, his spiritual practices have been influenced by his meditation teacher, Sylvia Boorstein (author of That\u2019s Funny, You Don\u2019t Look Buddhist: On Being a Faithful Jew and a Passionate Buddhist). To help integrate meditation practices and Jewish prayer, in 2005 Reb Moshe founded Nishmat Hayyim: The Breath of Life Jewish Meditation Community.\nOne of the hallmarks of Reb Moshe\u2019s career has been his activities as a bridge-builder across cultures and faiths. Participating in a groundbreaking encounter with Polish Catholicism in 1988 as a guest of Krakow\u2019s Cardinal Macharski, Reb Moshe and his colleagues confronted the age-old anti-Semitic teachings of the pre-Vatican II Polish Church. This encounter was especially poignant, as Reb Moshe and his group from the anti-defamation league, led by Lenny Zakim, toured Auschwitz with the Cardinal. Almost all of Reb Moshe\u2019s maternal relatives were murdered at Auschwitz, and it seemed virtually impossible that a grandson of a Polish Jew murdered by the Germans would be accompanying a Catholic cardinal to the place of their destruction. This trip led to Reb Moshe\u2019s active, ongoing Jewish-Catholic and Jewish-Christian Dialogue in the Boston area.\nIn 1989, Reb Moshe was instrumental in arranging the first meeting between the leader of Tibetan Buddhism, the Dalai Lama (which means, literally, Ocean of Wisdom) in a Buddhist monastery here in the United States. This encounter led to the historic \u201CJew in the Lotus\u201D trip to Dharamsala, India in the fall of 1990 and Reb Moshe\u2019s continued involvement in Jewish-Buddhist Dialogue.\nIn recent years, Reb Moshe has been active in creating a center for Jewish-Muslim Relations in Boston and has initiated and supported TBZ\u2019s affiliation with the Greater Boston Inferfaith Organization. In addition, Reb Moshe is an active member of the Brookline Clergy Association. In 2008, Reb Moshe was chosen by Newsweek magazine as one of the top 25 pulpit Rabbis in the United States.\nA storyteller and stand-up comedian (he is co-editor of The Big Book of Jewish Humor), Reb Moshe has used humor to animate our once-diminished shul. \u201CI\u2019m a real advocate of joy,\u201D he has noted. His joyful congregants agree.\nSince 1998, Reb Moshe has transformed our congregation from a few dozen (mostly-elderly) members, to a vibrant and diverse community of nearly 600. Based on his unique talents and TBZ\u2019s remarkable growth, Reb Moshe has become a much-sought lecturer on evolving Jewish culture and spiritual renewal.\nWith his wife, Anne, and their three daughters, Reb Moshe infuses our community with spirit, song, laughter and learning.",

      "description": "When MeK was founded in 1965, it was not a cult; it was a guerrilla organization fighting against the Shah\u0027s regime and the United States. MeK was founded by three university graduates, and a few years later Masoud Rajavi became a member. After the execution of all of its original founders by the Shah\u0027s regime, Rajavi became its self-appointed leader, and gradually changed the group into what it is now. Maryam Rajavi was a mere member, only known as the wife of a high-ranking member of the group named Mehdi Abrishamchii. In 1984 (in a manner similar to David Koresh\u0027s actions) she was asked to leave her husband and marry Masoud Rajavi in order to become co-leader of the organization, and did so. See https://www.freedomofmind.com/Info/infoDet.php?id=504 for more information. Masoud Banisadr\u0027s web site is RIDC.info and banisadr.info/.

The web site for their organization is nirmukta.com/\nPeople have heard of \u0022The Hard Rock Cafe\u0022 and the \u0022House of Blues\u0022 but many people were unaware that the founder of these businesses was Isaac Tigrett a devotee of Sai Baba- one of the most famous gurus in India, and one with the most despicable track records. He allegedly did sleight of hand techniques to \u0022manifest\u0022 objects and has been accused of raping countless numbers of young boys. Please see freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/groups/s/sathya/ for my page on this cult leader.\nPremanand trained countless people to do magic tricks and these folks traveled to remote villagers to debunk gurus, shamans and others who would prey on people\u0027s gullibility and superstitions. His life was threatened countless times and was harassed, but refused to stop speaking the truth.\nHe unfortunately succumbed to cancer and the world lost a truly great person. I will always remember him replicating some of the gurus\u0027s \u0022powers\u0022 by doing magic tricks and the delight he took in opening people\u0027s minds to the power of science and logic.\nMy site is freedomofmind.com",

      "description": "The Strategic Interactive Approach (SIA) is the focus of my second book, published in 2000 entitled Releasing the Bonds: Empowering People to Think for Themselves. People often feel so helpless, hurt and frustrated when a loved one has gotten involved with a controlling person or group. This is a approach based on love and using effective communication strategies to respectfully empower people to help themselves.\nThe talk was over an hour and the lighting was poor, however, it has been on my freedomofmind.com web site for several years and people have told me how helpful it has been for them to watch it.\nSince leaving the Moonies in 1976, I was involved with deprogramming for about a year before deciding it was not a way to really help people that was respectful. Courts decided not to allow ex-parte conservatorships for adult cult members, so it became illegal to be involved with anything involuntary. So because of this, we evolved what was called \u0022exit-counseling\u0022 but although it was legal and voluntary, it was hard to apply to most destructive cult situations. So the Strategic Interaction Approach evolved in which I worked with family and friends and developed a team to use ethical influence within a respectful, nuanced approach which is totally customized to fit any situation.\nIn July 2012, Steve released Freedom of Mind: Helping Loved Ones Leave Controlling People, Cults and Beliefs in paperback on amazon.com and in 3 e-book formats. Please read the book as it is much more updated that this talk.",

My talk was done on the anniversary of the Jonestown tragedy, November 18th 1878.\nI really enjoyed meeting and interacting with Rabbi David Wolpe, author of seven books, and a fellow survivor of cancer. There was also questions and answers.\nApologies for the poor quality of this video and especially poor audio. I repeatedly offered to use my HD camera but they insisted that they \u0022had it covered.\u0022 They did not.\nThere is another vimeo on this site which has subtitles for my talk.",

      "description": "An apocalyptic group that claims that Mother God is living in Korea. It is relentlessly recruiting new members who are almost instantly baptized. Former members say that they believe the Catholic Church is the anti-christ and that all churches that worship on Sunday are satanic. The group is accused of breaking up marriages and families, encouraging members to drop out of school and abandon their life goals. Also that they break up families.\nChildren in the group are viewed as a hindrance. Some former members have claimed they were encouraged to have abortions by leaders.\nRon Ramos was the first American installed as a deacon and was made a Missionary in 2005. He went to Korea three times and was an intricate part of the recruitment process in the United States. He and his wife decided to leave in 2011 due to inaccuracies in doctrine, lies that were uncovered, and the growing realization that the WMSCOG is destructive.",
