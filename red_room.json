In 2020, actor Danny Masterson - known mostly for his role on the early 2000s hit sitcom That 70s Show was charged with forcibly raping three women in separate incidents between 2001 and 2003. In an added layer of conspiracy, the Church of Scientology have been accused of covering up and enabling Masterson, by the victims; all three of whom were also practising Scientologists. This week we are deep diving on the trial, the accusations and focusing on the controversy now surrounding Ashton Kutcher \u0026 Mila Kunis; who not only got involved in the trial, but unveiled skeletons in their own closet.

      "description": "This week on the pod I am speaking to Briell Decker.Briell was born and raised within the FLDS Church, a fundamentalist sect of the Latter Day Saints that practice Polygamy. Her life was never normal; she had no TV, was forced out of school before High School and she could not date or mingle with boys - any semblance of a normal teenage childhood was banned.Her life changed forever when she had just turned 18 and Warren Jeffs requested her to be married to him, as one of his then 64 wives. Briell\u0027s father brought her to the leader, and she was married instantly. Briell spent the next 8 years under the control of the FLDS Church, where she was drugged to keep quiet and all measures were taken to keep her within the organisation. This is her story, on how she escaped and how she took the power back.Watch her TedTalk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWmsoCIuDn4\u0026ab_channel=TEDxTalks--- Send in a voice message: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/redroompod/message Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "This week we take a deep dive into the Church of Scientology and their relationship to (and obsession with) celebrities. From alleged cover-ups, arranged marriages to using the charisma of the celebrity to spread their beliefs far and wide, there is no Scientology without the A-list celeb, and seemingly nothing they won\u2019t do to keep their A-listers loyal followers.In this episode we cover the beginnings of this profitable relationship and how it was always L Ron Hubbard\u2019s wish to be a celebrity Church. We also talk about how John Travolta got involved with Scientology, how they helped his career and reputation before casting him aside and how now, they seem to be doing little to cover his tracks. Of course we take a look at Tom Cruise, the Church\u2019s alleged #2, and how the organisation have curated relationships, staff and an entire life for their most famous and devoted member.
