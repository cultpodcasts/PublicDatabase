      "description": "How therapy became a computer program and lost its soul\n\n1973: A researcher walks into a psychiatric hospital claiming to hear voices saying \u0022empty, hollow, thud.\u0022 He\u0027s immediately diagnosed with schizophrenia and held for weeks. The twist? He\u0027s perfectly sane. It\u0027s all an experiment to prove psychiatric diagnosis is fiction.\n\nThose three words - empty, hollow, thud - would become the perfect description of what American therapy was about to become.\n\nThis episode exposes how Cognitive Behavioral Therapy conquered psychology by promising scientific precision while secretly throwing out everything that makes therapy work. The computer metaphor for mind created treatments that were measurable, billable, and completely ineffective.\n\n\u00A0\n\nhttps://gettherapybirmingham.com/the-weird-history-of-psychotherapy-part-4-empty-hollow-thud-or-cbt-and-the-satanic-panic/\n\n\u00A0\n\nYou\u0027ll discover:\n\n\nHow Aaron Beck\u0027s computer metaphor reduced humans to software\nWhy the \u0022evidence-based\u0022 revolution was built on falsified research\nThe hidden truth: effective CBT therapists are doing depth work in disguise\nHow the Satanic Panic destroyed trust in memory and trauma\nWhy America\u0027s most \u0022rational\u0022 era believed in underground demon cults\nThe replication crisis that proved the \u0022gold standard\u0022 was fool\u0027s gold\n\n\uD83D\uDCDA Essential Reading from Taproot Therapy Collective: https://gettherapybirmingham.com/science-or-science-flavored-capitalism-deconstructing-the-evidence-based-practice-paradigm/ \n\nhttps://gettherapybirmingham.com/the-limits-of-behaviorism-rediscovering-the-soul-in-psychotherapy/ \n\nhttps://gettherapybirmingham.com/a-history-of-psychotherapy-and-how-it-got-here/ \n\nhttps://gettherapybirmingham.com/theodore-m-porter-and-the-critique-of-quantification/ \n\nhttps://gettherapybirmingham.com/when-evidence-based-practice-goes-wrong/\n\n\u00A0\n\nThe tragic irony: While hunting for evidence-based treatments, we lost the evidence for what actually heals - relationship, depth, time, and the mysterious process of being truly seen.",

Drawing upon diverse fields such as psychoanalysis, anthropology, and esoteric philosophy, Monk offers fresh perspectives on working with clients who struggle with uncanny experiences and the residue of developmental trauma. The podcast features an engaging conversation with professor of religion and psychoanalyst Dr. Marsha Hewitt, delving into topics such as magical thinking, clairvoyance, and the historical relationship between psychoanalysis and the occult. Join us for an illuminating exploration of the supernatural in the therapeutic context.\n\n\n#psychotherapy \n#AlexMonk\n#CursePosition\n#RelationalTrauma\n#UnconsciousPhantasies\n#Psychoanalysis\n#Anthropology\n#Supernatural\n#TraumaTreatment\n#PsychotherapyPodcast\n#DepthPsychology",

      "description": "In this thought-provoking solo episode, the host delves into the psychological underpinnings of cults and conspiracy theories. Key takeaways include: Cults replace authenticity with false promises, exploiting members\u0027 time, sexuality, and resources \u0026#x1f3ad; Conspiracy movements provide a false sense of agency and empowerment, driving people to take action based on unverified beliefs \u0026#x1f575;\uFE0F\u200D\u2642\uFE0F Charismatic cult leaders often exhibit symptoms of temporal lobe epilepsy, such as hyper-religiosity, hypergraphia, and altered sexual behavior \u0026#x1f9e0; Cults and conspiracy theories thrive when society fails to provide pathways to self-actualization, economic stability, and a hopeful future \u0026#x1f4c9; Intuition and the unconscious play a significant role in the appeal of these movements, as people seek meaning and purpose beyond the rational mind \u0026#x1f52e; The episode emphasizes the importance of addressing systemic issues that contribute to the rise of cults and conspiracy theories, rather than simply dismissing adherents as crazy or stupid. By understanding the psychological inevitability of these phenomena, we can work towards creating a society that fosters authentic growth and actualization. \u0026#x1f331; #CultPsychology #ConspiracyTheories #SelfActualization #UnconciousMind #SystemicIssues #TemporalLobeEpilepsy #CharismaticLeaders #FalseEmpowerment #IntuitionAndMeaning #AuthenticGrowth #PodcastInsights #MentalHealthAwareness #SocialCommentary #PersonalDevelopment #HumanPotential",
