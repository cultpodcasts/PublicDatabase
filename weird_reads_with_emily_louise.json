      "description": "On May 23rd, 1973 Judy Doraty and her family were travelling home from a bingo game in Texas when they saw a strange light in the sky on a lonely patch of highway. What came next would change the course of Judy\u0027s life forever. Through a series of hypnotic regressions she began to recall being aboard an alien spaceship and her testimony would provide one of the first links between alien abductions and cattle mutilations. Her story would go on to become the blueprint for another bizarre abduction case that kickstarted the Dulce base conspiracy -- but was any of it real?\n\nThis documentary is a skeptical exploration of the people involved in Judy\u0027s story -- from Linda Moulton Howe to Dr Leo Sprinkle --  and how they shaped and influenced it. It also explores hypnotic regression therapy, false memories and how our minds can be manipulated by even the most well meaning of people.\n\nWATCH THE FIRST TWO VIDEOS IN THIS SERIES:\nSnippy the Horse: https://youtu.be/7Ff25wY4oNE?si=SD-HpYLqtLPGBKvs\nThe Secret History of Dulce: https://youtu.be/AlhcmqevfXA?si=i15bFqB1cOpuDfCW\n\nSUPPORT THE CHANNEL ON PATREON:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/weirdreadsemilylouise\n\nSpecial thanks to Christopher O\u0027Brien, Jack Brewer and Mark Pilkington for taking the time to talk to me.\n\nCheck out Jack\u0027s book The Greys Have Been Framed here:\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Greys-Have-Been-Framed-Exploitation/dp/1519579616\n\nExpanding Frontiers Research:\nhttps://www.expandingfrontiersresearch.org/\n\nStalking the Herd by Christopher O\u0027Brien:\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Stalking-Herd-Examining-Mutilation-Mystery/dp/1939149061\n\nMirage Men by Mark Pilkington:\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Mirage-Men-Journey-Disinformation-Paranoia/dp/1845298578\n\nSOURCES:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1WZWYRmvGJNfLpbZysthYIU91UD4FQnZB1AN9u4JPwvk/edit?usp=sharing\n\nThank you to Stephanie Quick, Oki\u0027s Weird Stories, John E.L Tenney, Jessica Knapik, Steve Berg, Reid, Robert Skvarla, Tanner F.

It was a brutal and senseless murder, one that shook the local community and had the police desperately searching for answers. A shocking arrest soon led to tabloid tales of a supposed \u201Cwitchcraft murder mystery\u201D and plans for a \u0022love cult\u0022 that had led to homicide. These were salacious headlines that sold newspapers and kept readers gripped, but the story behind the headlines was far more real and much more disturbing. \n\nJoin my Patreon to get early access to videos, our Discord server and exclusive video/audio content!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/weirdreadsemilylouise\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\nhttps://x.com/Weirdreadsemily\n\nFollow me on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/weirdreadsemilylouise/\n\nThanks to Tanner F.

As it turned out, underneath his spiritually enlightened veneer stood a man accused of being a cult leader, a predator, an alcoholic, a liar. The allegations made headline news and soon people across the United States were reading about the strange metaphysical teachings of a man that called himself Lahissa, the New Teacher. \n\nI first heard about this cult via an article by Beardy History:\nhttps://beardyhistory.com/2023/08/07/crazy-cults-of-the-1920s-and-1930s/\n\nYou can find all of my sources here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1SWZTdmcbPi6BWubVNLJaYZLzay7IReqEdmnseQcxQVc/edit?usp=sharing \n\nSupport my work via Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/weirdreadsemilylouise \n\nFollow me on Twitter:\nhttps://x.com/Weirdreadsemily \n\nFollow me on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/weirdreadsemilylouise/ \n\nVOICES\nSteve Berg - https://x.com/Bergmaster5000 \nJen and James (Fundie Fridays) - https://www.youtube.com/@FundieFridays \nTanner F.

The three people at the center of the claim were devout disciples of Guy and Edna Ballard\u2019s I AM Activity \u2014 a bizarre proto-new age movement that had stirred controversy and accusations of being a cult throughout the 1930s. Their claim of precipitating, or manifesting the twin ray, culminated in a disturbing all-night ritual, charges of insanity, a mysterious abduction, a court case, and an even deeper, more earthly mystery at the heart of it all. \n\nYou can support my work on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/weirdreadsemilylouise\n\nYou can watch my original video on the Cult of I AM here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsKt4edO98w\n\nCHAPTERS\n00:00:00 INTRO\n00:02:03 PART ONE: THE TWIN FLAME OF JESUS\n00:21:30 PART TWO: THE STORY FALLS APART\n00:33:40 PART THREE: LOCKED UP\n00:39:58 PART FOUR: THE LAWSUIT\n00:50:27 PART FIVE: THE MYSTERY OF LUCILLE SILVER\n\nTWITTER \uD83D\uDC26\nhttps://twitter.com/Weirdreadsemily\n\nINSTAGRAM \uD83D\uDCF7\nhttps://www.instagram.com/weirdreadsemilylouise/",

      "description": "There have been so many disturbing cults throughout history, but May Otis Blackburn\u2019s Divine Order of the Royal Arms of the Great Eleven has to be one of the weirdest\u2026and obscure.\n\nMay and her daughter Ruth were trying to make it in Hollywood, but instead they were visited by Archangel Gabriel, who told them that they were the two witnesses from the Book of Revelations. But the story doesn\u2019t stop there, and it gets a whole lot stranger\u2026\n\nWe covered this case on my podcast, Dial Femme for Murder, and we\u2019re hoping to have Samuel Fort on soon to discuss his excellent book, The Cult of the Great Eleven which I highly recommend reading!\n\nLISTEN TO THE PODCAST HERE \uD83D\uDCFB \nhttps://open.spotify.com/show/48bpBUCx3c59aLcscDlXhe \n\nSpecial thanks to Triskaidekapho13ic for helping source archive materials \u0026 creating an actual sources document for me\n\nSOURCES \uD83D\uDCDC \nhttps://bit.ly/3AT7cVP\n\nEnjoyed the video?

      "description": "Edgar Cayce is one of America\u0027s most famous so-called \u201Cpsychics\u201D of all time, and widely known as one of the architects of the modern New Age movement, as well as being the \u0022sleeping prophet\u0022.\n\nIn this video, we trace the strange story of Edgar Cayce\u0027s life - from his origins in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, to his years tapping into \u201CSource\u201D, his time spent trying to cash in on the Texas oil boom and his later readings on everything from Atlantis to the origin of humanity. \n\nWas Edgar Cayce a fraud, or was he the real deal?\n\nHonestly, I think he was a successful grifter that cashed in on the growing popularity of alternative medicine and trance healing, as well as new age ideas that had been popularized by Helena Blavatsky and other theosophists. \n\nSome of his ideas were incredibly harmful and discriminatory - but I\u2019ll let you watch and form your own opinions!

      "description": "Helena Blavatsky was the founder of the Theosophical Society and widely known as the Grandmother of the New Age. In this video, I dive into her life - from her aristocratic upbringing, to her years of travelling around the world, to controversy, her teachings and her legacy.\n\nThis is the first part in a forthcoming series on the New Age and UFO cults. It\u2019s important to understand Helena Blavatsky first, because she created so much of what we know as \u201Cnew age\u201D, and almost every group that we\u2019ll be talking about takes something from her. I am so excited to share this new series with you all. I\u0027ve been fascinated by new religious movements and cults for a long time, and I wanted to find a way to talk about them that doesn\u2019t feel exploitative. I think it\u2019s important to remember that inside all of these movements/cults is someone who has a family and people that love them, and often there are victims too.\n\nI know this video was quite historical, so let me know what you think in the comments. Also what do you think of the new filming set up? It feels more\u2026cosy? Idk. Sound off down below.\n\nAlso I feel like my explanation of \u0022Aryan\u0022 was incredibly brief and over simplified and I\u0027d urge you all to go and read this article.

      "description": "Today we\u0027re going to be diving deep into the disappearance of Shelly Miscavige and the Church of Scientology to find out what really happened - is Shelly Miscavige missing, or is she a prisoner of belief?\n\nI\u0027m truly fascinated with cults \u0026 religions and Scientology has been one of my favourite religious organisations to look into for a while now. I think I\u0027ve watched almost every documentary, from John Sweeney on the BBC, to Louis Theroux, Going Clear, Leah Remini\u0027s show and obviously the great journalism from Tony Ortega. I wanted to talk about Shelly Miscavige on here for a while because, from the outside, it seems like a terrifying mystery...the first lady of Scientology that went missing. However, when you dig into it, you find - in my opinion - an even more terrifying story of coercive control and years of religious indoctrination -- ALLEGEDLY.\n\nAnyway, I hope you enjoy this video and I definitely have a lot more videos on cults \u0026 religious organisations coming up.
