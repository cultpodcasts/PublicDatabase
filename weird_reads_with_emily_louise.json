On October 12th, 1935, The Vancouver Sun in Canada ran a front page article that would\u2019ve immediately captured the attention of just about anyone passing by. It read, \u2018Husband Seeks Ban On Cult\u2019 and the contents were bizarre and salacious \u2014 there were allegations of theft, hypnosis, mysterious telephone calls and even a kidnapping. Little was known about this strange Vancouver sect or the man that led them. Who were they and did they really hypnotize a woman, ultimately kidnapping her?\n\nYou can support the channel by joining my Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/weirdreadsemilylouise\n\nCHAPTERS\n00:00 INTRO\n00:40 AD BREAK\n01:46 PART ONE: NEW THOUGHT \u0026 THE UNITY FELLOWSHIP\n07:48 PART TWO: THE SOLAR TEMPLE\n17:57 PART THREE: KIDNAPPED?\n25:36 PART FOUR: OH BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?",

      "description": "In July 1938 a startling announcement rocked the city of Richmond, Virginia \u2014 the twin ray of Jesus Christ had been received in the form of a two month old baby, and it was here to usher in a new Golden Age. The three people at the center of the claim were devout disciples of Guy and Edna Ballard\u2019s I AM Activity \u2014 a bizarre proto-new age movement that had stirred controversy and accusations of being a cult throughout the 1930s. Their claim of precipitating, or manifesting the twin ray, culminated in a disturbing all-night ritual, charges of insanity, a mysterious abduction, a court case, and an even deeper, more earthly mystery at the heart of it all. \n\nYou can support my work on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/weirdreadsemilylouise\n\nYou can watch my original video on the Cult of I AM here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsKt4edO98w\n\nCHAPTERS\n00:00:00 INTRO\n00:02:03 PART ONE: THE TWIN FLAME OF JESUS\n00:21:30 PART TWO: THE STORY FALLS APART\n00:33:40 PART THREE: LOCKED UP\n00:39:58 PART FOUR: THE LAWSUIT\n00:50:27 PART FIVE: THE MYSTERY OF LUCILLE SILVER\n\nTWITTER \uD83D\uDC26\nhttps://twitter.com/Weirdreadsemily\n\nINSTAGRAM \uD83D\uDCF7\nhttps://www.instagram.com/weirdreadsemilylouise/",

They were guided by the ascended masters - a group of spiritual advisors that Guy, Edna and their son Donald claimed to have direct contact with, including Jesus and St Germain.\n\nBut behind the brightly coloured charts and strangely aesthetically appealing artwork, lies a more sinister story, connecting this world of new age woo-woo directly to f*scists and right-wing ideology that\u0027s still very much present to this day.\n\nEnjoyed the video?

In this video, I dive into her life - from her aristocratic upbringing, to her years of travelling around the world, to controversy, her teachings and her legacy.\n\nThis is the first part in a forthcoming series on the New Age and UFO cults. It\u2019s important to understand Helena Blavatsky first, because she created so much of what we know as \u201Cnew age\u201D, and almost every group that we\u2019ll be talking about takes something from her. I am so excited to share this new series with you all. I\u0027ve been fascinated by new religious movements and cults for a long time, and I wanted to find a way to talk about them that doesn\u2019t feel exploitative. I think it\u2019s important to remember that inside all of these movements/cults is someone who has a family and people that love them, and often there are victims too.\n\nI know this video was quite historical, so let me know what you think in the comments. Also what do you think of the new filming set up? It feels more\u2026cosy? Idk.

      "title": "The INSANE story of the Love Has Won cult \u0026 Amy Carlson | DEEP DIVE",
      "description": "This video is a deep dive into Love Has Won and Amy Carlson/Mother God, their beliefs, the well documented abuse of followers, the allegations of fraud and other criminal connections, Amy\u2019s ill health, and ultimately her death. From the Galactic Free Press, to Love Has Won, I hope this video goes some way to explaining the cult and why they are dangerous. I have no doubt I\u2019ll be making a part two of this video as more information surfaces, now that they are finally being investigated.\n\nMany thanks to Eve, Milo, Sammy, Ryan and all of the teams at Rising Above Love Has Won and Love Has Won Exposed for helping me put this video together.\n\nSUPPORT THE CHANNEL\nhttps://bit.ly/3ugO5AN \n\nFOLLOW ME EVERYWHERE\nhttps://linktr.ee/EmilyLouise1989 \n\nLISTEN TO MY PODCAST\nhttps://spoti.fi/3tl9RTF \n\nWhat makes Love Has Won a cult?\nhttps://bit.ly/3ui4Njg \n\nKD Wells \u201CMy History with Amy Carlson\u201D \nhttps://bit.ly/3aSOyl9 \n\nRising Above Love Has Won\nhttps://bit.ly/3u93HX3 \n\nLove Has Won Exposed\nhttps://bit.ly/3vzHodm \n\nLove Has Won Subreddit\nhttps://bit.ly/2SdUL4u\n\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n00:00 : Intro\n01.39 : How I found Love Has Won\n03:00 : Who are Love Has Won?\n10:04 : Origins of Love Has Won : 2009 - 2018\n19:07 : Jason Castillo\n21:12 : Follower Abuse\n28:58 : Leaving a follower for dead in the desert\n31:20 : How do they recruit?\n33:58 : Allegations of fraud\n39:27 : Crime, missing people and corruption\n44:22 : Hawaii and Dr Phil\n46:34 : Amy\u2019s health\n51:19 : Body found, investigation begins\n54:31 : What can you do?\n56:52 : Outro\n\n#lovehaswon #amycarlson #mothergod",
