      "description": "We\u0027ll be back in late January 2024 with plenty of exciting interviews booked in the calendar.\u00A0 But for now enjoy one of our most popular episodes from the past year. And remember to subscribe and share. We talk with veteran Aussie actor Guy Pearce, whose career now spans four decades, from his debut as a novice straight out of high school in Neighbours, via Hollywood movies like LA Confidential and international hits like The King\u0027s Speech, to high-end TV series such as Jack Irish and Mare of Easttown and his new show coming out shortly on Disney\u002B - The Clearing - an eight-part thriller set in Victoria. Hosting this conversation - about everything from how fatherhood has changed him, to his itinerant global life, to how he really feels about the Neighbours reboot, is senior culture writer for The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald, Karl Quinn. This episode first aired on May 19, 2023.See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",
