      "description": "MONKEY ON A STICK : MURDER, MADNESS AND THE HARE KRISHNAS\n\nIn theaters October 18th, 2024\n\nDirected by Jason Lapeyre\n\nMonkey on a Stick is a feature-length documentary expos\u00E9 of the criminal activity that took place in the Hare Krishna movement in the West in the 1970s and \u201880s, adapted from the New York Times bestselling book.  It tells the story of devotees like Nori Muster, a young woman from Los Angeles who joins the movement to find inner peace and spiritual meaning and instead discovers a rotting heart of criminal activity taking place within ISKCON, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.  Drug smuggling, stockpiling weapons, and the subjugation and exploitation of female devotees metastasizes to widespread child sexual abuse and murder, all under the watch of ISKCON\u2019s spiritual leaders - the gurus who run the movement.  Monkey on a Stick investigates how and why human nature drives some to dream the purest spiritual dreams but causes others to manifest our worst, basest nightmares.\n\nFollow Sphere Films Canada on :\nhttps: //www.sphere-films.ca/ \nhttps: //www.facebook.com/spherefilmscanada/ \nX (Twitter): https://twitter.com/SphereFilmsCA \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/spherefilmscanada",
