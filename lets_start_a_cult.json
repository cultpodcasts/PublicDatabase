August Engelhardt, born with a silver spoon, was many things, and one of them was delusional, something he shared with other cults and their leaders. You might wonder the peculiarities of Engelhardt\u2019s delusion. It is nothing other than the obsessive yet interesting relationship he developed with the fruit with one of the hardest shells. This is a man that decided to give everything up for a life of nudity and a diet consisting of nothing other than coconuts.

In fact, former Scientologist and actress Leah Remini once said, quote, \u201CBeing critical of Tom Cruise is being critical of Scientology itself. You are a person who is anti\u2013 the aims and goals of Scientology. You are evil.\u201D End quote.  It\u2019s crazy to think that a belief system created in the 1950s managed to become so powerful that it was able to turn an ordinary human being into a deity worshipped by members.

In fact, its members even opened their commune to visitors, welcoming up to half a million of them during peak season. They also formed their own baseball team that went on to compete with the nation\u2019s best, making headlines across the United States and contributing significantly to how the game has evolved throughout the centuries. Perhaps the most bizarre thing about the devotees of the House of David was how the men refused to shave and cut their hair. Photos show them wearing baseball outfits, with full beards and hair streaming down their backs. But as odd as their appearances were, the residents of Benton Harbor, Michigan, where the commune was located, held nothing but love for them.

      "description": "The 1970s was a time of searching and exploration around the world. Following decades of war and unrest, young people yearned for happiness, meaning, and peace. They wanted to be enlightened, spiritually awakened. They craved to be part of something bigger and more meaningful than the regular 9-5 grind. This desire was the perfect foundation for cults. Flower children devoted themselves to people like Charles Manson and James Jones, who made promises of something bigger and better to come\u2013if they only devoted their lives to serving them. When one man, Roch Th\u00E9riault, found that his charm had a certain power over people\u2013that on words alone he could draw audiences in and leave them begging for more \u2013he saw an opportunity to start a cult of his own, The Ant Hill Kids.
