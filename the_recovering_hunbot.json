      "title": "Chris Shelton \u0026 Jon Atack Analyze Potential Mind Control in the Business Opportunity ONPASSIVE",
      "description": "I began listening to Chris Shelton and Jon Atack in late 2018 or early 2019. Their words resonated with me and I began to question the business opportunity I had joined. Eventually, r/antimlm content enterd my recommended videos and I started watching. Chris and Jon helped me wake up and to begin to think critically once again. Their expert insight helped me see what I experienced was not something unusual or in a vaccum. Others who were involved in differet organizations had many of the same feelings as I did. I owe much of my healing to both Chris and Jon. I thank them for putting out such meaningful content that is so very helpful to those of us who have been involved in an organization that dominates your life with coercive conrtol.\r\n\r\nI also began to do independent research, that is how I became friends and colleagues with them, Robert Fitzpatrick, Doug Brooks, Dr. William Keep, and others who have spoken out about the many problems of multilevel marketing companies. When I found out they were having a conference, I asked if I could also present. Hence, I have been part of the Multilevel Marketing The Consumer Protection Challenge ever since.\n\nDonate/Support The Channel Here:\nVenmo: @recoveringhunbot\nCashApp: $TheRecoveringHunbot\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE RECOVERING HUNBOT\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@RecoveringHunbot?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNSCRIPTED\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC51leKQidL_isplO1hq0AVA?sub_confirmation=1\n\nAll clips used for fair use commentary, criticism, and educational purposes.
