      "title": "Jehovah\u0027s Witness Elders Question A Brother For Not Turning In Field Service Time",
      "description": "Let me start of by saying this is not a dig or bashing of these loving concerned JW elders. These elders are genuine but are in a mental trap. That trap is the Governing Body of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses trumps all other things...including the bible.\nMy conscience was truly bothered when I reported field service time because it did not strengthen my faith. Even when I would get 20 hours or more a month, reporting my time felt compulsorily. Turning in time is not a scriptural requirement. \n\nIf you are a JW, honestly ask yourself are you more concerned at the end of the month with talking to people or \u0022getting your hours in.\u0022 \nThe \u0027Organized to do Jehovah\u0027s Will\u0027 book says that in the bible book of Acts, Paul gave specific numbers of those who became believers and thus this is justification to turn in service time. With the direction of the Governing Body, the writers of the \u0027Organized\u0027 book fail to tell you that scriptures like Acts 5:14, Acts 6:7, Acts 11:24, and other scriptures; Paul was not concerned with keeping exact numbers of those who became believers. It\u0027s a conscience matter and a personal choice if you want or do not want to report your time every month.\nAs JWs, we are truth seekers.....no matter where that truth takes us.\n",
