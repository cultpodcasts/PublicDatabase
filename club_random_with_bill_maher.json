      "description": "Bill Maher is joined by media personality and podcaster Billy Bush for a sharp, surprising, and hilarious conversation that bounces from family dynasties to the minefields of modern media. Bush opens up about growing up a Manhattan kid with presidential uncles, surviving scandal, and finding his voice again behind the mic. The two swap stories about Hollywood etiquette, Julia Roberts at the Oscars, psychedelic trips, and why everyone\u2019s addicted to outrage. They debate fame, forgiveness, how tequila ages over time \u2013 and Bush recalls the wildest elevator encounter in New York, proof that even fame has its ups and downs.
