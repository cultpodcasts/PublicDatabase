He also conned an elderly widow out of a $5 million estate and was accused of assaulting a 14-year-old girl. Newspapers soon reported that Jeffers claimed \u201CGod told him to leave Missouri.\u201D\n\nThe final years of his life were just as bizarre. From Bermuda to Australia, he tried pushing his twisted beliefs but was quickly rejected. Despite allegations of fraud, grooming, and sexual assault, Jeffers escaped real accountability.\n\nIn 1988, just a month before turning 90, Joseph Jeffers died of natural causes\u2014never truly facing justice for the lives he harmed.\n\n\uD83D\uDCCC Watch now as we uncover the outrageous final years of Joseph Jeffers and the shocking crimes that went largely unpunished.\n__________________________________________________________________\nBlog:\nhttps://synovaink.com/2025/09/30/the-outrageous-final-years-of-cult-leader-joseph-jeffers/\n_____________________________________________________________________\nSponsorship:\nORDER: Madman or Messiah?\nhttps://a.co/d/i3jI20x\n\n__________________________________________________________________\nBones Coffee Company Sponsor:\n\nwww.bonescoffee.com/synovaink\n\ncoupon code: SYNOVAINK\n_________________________________________________________________",
