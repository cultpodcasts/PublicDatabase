      "description": "Investigative journalist (and Psych for Sore Mind friend) Andrew Gold recently got into a heated debate with one of the guests from his channel (On the Edge) - an ex-Jehovah\u0027s Witness named Lloyd Evans. This was after discussion of a recent scandal involving prostitutes. Lloyd Evans won\u0027t apologise to anyone but his wife. After the video, purportedly threatened to sue Andrew Gold if he talked to Lloyd\u0027s ex-colleague and producer (which Andrew did).\r\n\r\nWhat was all the commotion about? Were Lloyd\u0027s actions all the more deplorable given his apparent position in protecting sex workers? Was Andrew right to push Lloyd\u0027s buttons? Did he you take it too far?\n\n#Lloyd Evans #JehovahWitness #cult",

      "description": "In a dark case of alleged murder, Idaho \u0027Doomsday cult\u0027 couple Lori Vallow and Chad Daybell are charged with killing her two children, Tylee and JJ. Now Vallow has been declared unfit to stand trial throwing an unexpected twist in this already complex and ugly case.\n\n\u2705 Don\u0027t Forget to LIKE \uD83D\uDC4D SUBSCRIBE \uD83D\uDD14\uFE0F\uFE0F\uFE0F SHARE \u2197\uFE0F\n\u21AA\uFE0Fhttps://bit.ly/DrDas-PsychSore\n\nWhen mental health and the law cross, as in this case with Lori Vallow, there\u0027s an overlap between psychiatry and treatment and the courts and legal process. This is exactly my area of expertise and where I assess patients and offenders and give testimony to the UK courts as an expert witness. In this video, I use this experience to breakdown the Vallow Daybell case.\n\n\uD835\uDDE6\uD835\uDDF5\uD835\uDDEE\uD835\uDDFF\uD835\uDDF2 \uD835\uDE01\uD835\uDDF5\uD835\uDDF6\uD835\uDE00 \uD835\uDE03\uD835\uDDF6\uD835\uDDF1\uD835\uDDF2\uD835\uDDFC \uD835\uDE04\uD835\uDDF6\uD835\uDE01\uD835\uDDF5 \uD835\uDDEE \uD835\uDDF3\uD835\uDDFF\uD835\uDDF6\uD835\uDDF2\uD835\uDDFB\uD835\uDDF1: https://youtu.be/_zNWA9KLVs0\n\n\u25B6\uFE0F WATCH MORE VIDEOS:\n\n\u2714\uFE0F My Playlists : \n\u25B6\uFE0F True Crime Cases - http://bit.ly/true-crime-cases\n\u25B6\uFE0F Exploring Psychopaths - http://bit.ly/exploring-psychopaths\n\u25B6\uFE0F Faking Mental Illness - https://bit.ly/faking-mental-illness\n\u25B6\uFE0F Gangs, Mental Health and Crime - http://bit.ly/gangs-crime-MH\n\u25B6\uFE0F Best of A Psych For Sore Minds - http://bit.ly/APFSM-best-of\n\n\u2705 Keep in touch on social media:\n\n\uD83D\uDC49 TWITTER - https://twitter.com/PsychSore\n\uD83D\uDC49 FACEBOOK - https://www.facebook.com/psychsore\n\uD83D\uDC49 INSTAGRAM - https://www.instagram.com/psychforsoreminds\n\n\u2709 Email us at psychforsoreminds@gmail.com\n\n\u2734 Look out for NEW EPISODES EVERY TUESDAY AND FRIDAY! \u2734\n\n\u25B8 \uD835\uDC00 \uD835\uDC0F\uD835\uDC2C\uD835\uDC32\uD835\uDC1C\uD835\uDC21 \uD835\uDC05\uD835\uDC28\uD835\uDC2B \uD835\uDC12\uD835\uDC28\uD835\uDC2B\uD835\uDC1E \uD835\uDC0C\uD835\uDC22\uD835\uDC27\uD835\uDC1D\uD835\uDC2C \uD835\uDC22\uD835\uDC2C \uD835\uDC2D\uD835\uDC21\uD835\uDC1E \uD835\uDC28\uD835\uDC27\uD835\uDC25\uD835\uDC32 \uD835\uDC18\uD835\uDC28\uD835\uDC2E\uD835\uDC13\uD835\uDC2E\uD835\uDC1B\uD835\uDC1E \uD835\uDC02\uD835\uDC21\uD835\uDC1A\uD835\uDC27\uD835\uDC27\uD835\uDC1E\uD835\uDC25 \uD835\uDC2D\uD835\uDC21\uD835\uDC1A\uD835\uDC2D \uD835\uDC1C\uD835\uDC28\uD835\uDC2F\uD835\uDC1E\uD835\uDC2B\uD835\uDC2C \uD835\uDC2D\uD835\uDC2B\uD835\uDC2E\uD835\uDC1E \uD835\uDC1C\uD835\uDC2B\uD835\uDC22\uD835\uDC26\uD835\uDC1E \uD835\uDC1A\uD835\uDC27\uD835\uDC1D \uD835\uDC26\uD835\uDC1E\uD835\uDC27\uD835\uDC2D\uD835\uDC1A\uD835\uDC25 \uD835\uDC22\uD835\uDC25\uD835\uDC25\uD835\uDC27\uD835\uDC1E\uD835\uDC2C\uD835\uDC2C, hosted by a professional Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist and expert witness discussing his own real life (anonymised) cases.
