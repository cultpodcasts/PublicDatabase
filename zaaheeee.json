      "title": "Inside Canada\u2019s STRANGEST Cult",
      "description": "Who is Romana Didulo, the self-proclaimed \u201CQueen of Canada? She leads one of the strangest cult movements in modern Canadian history. Claiming the throne of a nation that doesn\u2019t recognize her, she\u2019s built a decently large following online by spreading conspiracy theories, making outrageous proclamations, and presenting herself as Canada\u2019s rightful ruler. But behind the spectacle is a darker truth: vulnerable people being manipulated, families torn apart, and entire communities left to deal with the chaos she leaves behind. In this video, we uncover the origins of the fake\u201CQueen of Canada\u201D \u2014 how she rose from obscurity to cult figure, the tactics she uses to secure loyalty, and how her movement feeds on misinformation, fear, and false hope.",
