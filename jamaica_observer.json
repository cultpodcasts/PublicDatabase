      "description": "Kevin Smith had proclaimed himself a king and a prophet, and later convinced his followers at Pathways International Kingdom Restoration Ministries that he was \u201CGod in the flesh\u201D.\n\nBut the path Smith walked led to ruin and disrepute, toward a destiny of destruction that haunts him even after death.\n\nPosthumously charged with multiple crimes including murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and firearm offences, Smith cemented his place in history as one of Jamaica\u2019s most notorious cult leaders.\n\nThrough more eyewitness accounts and disturbing details, the Jamaica Observer continues its chilling exploration of faith, manipulation and institutional failure, and confronts the haunting question: Did Kevin Smith really die?\n\nThis is the official YouTube channel of Jamaica Observer.
