      "title": "How To Free Our Minds \u2014 with Cult Deprogramming Expert Dr. Steven Hassan",
      "description": "How would you know if you were in a cult? If not a cult, then at least under undue influence? The truth is: we\u0027re all under some form of undue influence. The question is: to what degree and to what extent we\u2019re aware of this influence \u2014 which is exacerbated by social media. In an era of likes, followers, and echo chambers, how can we become aware of undue influence and gain sovereignty over our minds? Our guest this week is Dr. Steven Hassan, an expert on undue influence, brainwashing, and unethical hypnosis. He\u2019s the founder of the Freedom of Mind Resource Center \u2014 a coaching, consulting, and training organization dedicated to helping people freely consider how they want to live their lives. Dr. Hassan was himself a member of a cult: the Unification Church (also known as the Moonies), which was developed in Korea in the 1950\u0027s. Since leaving the Moonies, Dr. Hassan has helped thousands of individuals and families recover from undue influence.
