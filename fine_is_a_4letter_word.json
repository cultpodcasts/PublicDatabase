      "description": "Imagine, for a moment, being a child and knowing something was wrong, but being too young to understand.Now picture yourself in a cult without knowing the word for it.That\u2019s what happened to Sally Lotz.Until she was four years old, things seemed normal. Then her parents divorced, her dad left the picture as he served overseas in the military, and her mother took Sally and her siblings to a new city.Suddenly, everything changed.Instead of having freedom to explore, now all her decisions were made for her. How she dressed for school and which classmates she was allowed to interact with (meaning none). Her role was to do only what others told her to do.Sally knew something wasn\u2019t right. One of the first clues came when she buried a butterfly she believed was dead, and then unburied the soil later and found the butterfly was gone. If there was no heaven, as Sally was told by the cult, where did the dead butterfly go?Her new stepfather abused her in every horrible way imaginable. And her mother accused her of being a \u201Cbad influence\u201D moments after her stepdad kicked their cat across the room. Sally was made to feel that being sexually molested by him was her own fault. On top of that, she was told there was no way to prove it even happened because she didn\u2019t have two witnesses to back her claims.Ironically, the people who caught Sally making out with her high school boyfriend didn\u2019t need two witnesses. All it took was their word, and Sally found herself facing a perverted, sexually charged interrogation by multiple adult men.Sally soon left the cult and joined her father who was now in San Diego, where she went straight from having to follow rules for everything to no rules at all. She finished school, then tried college, but it didn\u2019t work out. She went back to what felt familiar and found a man to take care of her. They married when she was only 20 and had three children.Despite all that had happened up until then, Sally\u2019s life seemed to be improving and everything seemed fine.But Fine is a 4-letter word.She found that out when her husband joined a cult similar to the one she\u2019d been raised in, and all the same rules suddenly came back into play. She divorced him. But then her mother, who had not left the cult, came to stay with her.In a moment, when you meet Sally, you\u2019ll join her on a journey down a winding road with double-backs and wrong turns as she comes to cope with two traumas \u2013 the trauma of an abusive home and religious trauma. These two things have fueled her career as an author, writing coach, and mentor. Her fourth book, The Truth is a Lie, is a young adult novel based on her life growing up in a cult and aims to help others understand and gain strength.Sally\u2019s hype song is \u0022Girl on Fire\u201D by Alicia Keys.
