      "description": "Ever wanted to Jedi mind-trick your way through life? This episode, we check out the world of Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP)\u2014a psychological toolkit that promises to help you persuade, influence, and maybe even convince you that banana flavored whiskey is next on your \u201Ctry\u201D list. But does it actually work, or is it just a fancy way to say, \u201Cgaslighting, but make it self-improvement\u201D? To put our minds (and taste buds) to the test, we also crack open a bottle of Howler Head Banana Whiskey\u2014because nothing screams \u0022cutting-edge psychology\u0022 like a questionable booze experiment. Will it be a delightful tropical escape or just regret in a glass? In this episode, we cover: What NLP is (and why it sounds like either a superpower or a scam) How banana-flavored whiskey makes us question our life choices The inevitable moment when we wonder, \u0022Who actually asked for this drink?\u0022 Tune in for a mix of mind games, monkey business, and questionable drinking decisions \u0026#x1f606; \u0026#x1f34c; \u0026#x1f943; The whisky: https://howlerhead.com/products/howler-head-bourbon The facts and stuffs: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/neuro-linguistic-programming-therapy https://www.nlpcourses.com/cult-of-nlp-is-neuro-linguistic-programming-nlp-a-cult/ https://www.npr.org/2022/10/17/1128808224/the-vow-part-2-cult-nxivm-keith-raniere-nancy-salzman",
