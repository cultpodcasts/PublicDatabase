      "title": "39: The Cult of Wellness? With Charlotte Church and Michele Knight",
      "description": "The wellness industry is worth about $5 trillion worldwide and it feels like there\u0027s always something we should be spending money on to benefit our mind, body and soul. But the quest to feel our best can come at a cost that extends beyond the financial - it can impact our relationships too. Here to unpack the world of wellness, spirituality and radical healing with Anna is Charlotte Church (singer and founder of wellness and healing centre, The Dreaming ) and Michele Knight (psychic, astrologer and Sunday-Times best-selling author). Together, they discuss a dilemma from a listener who is skeptical about his partner\u2019s belief in alternative therapies and the validity of the wellness industry as a whole. They also address a dilemma from someone who is concerned his partner is becoming overly dependent on her psychic. During the conversation, Charlotte and Michele explore the tension between helping people and monetisation, the dangers of spiritual and psychic practices when not conducted ethically, and whether it\u2019s possible to build a relationship with someone who fundamentally has different beliefs. \u2014 Have questions about sex? Divorce? Motherhood? Menopause? Mental health? With no topic off limits, Anna\u2019s here to prove that whatever you\u2019re going through, it\u2019s not just you.
