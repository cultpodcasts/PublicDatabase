      "description": "Could this be the scandal that ends Keir Starmer\u2019s career? \n \nThe Prime Minister is under fire in one of the biggest political scandals of the century after appointing Peter Mandelson, despite his links to Jeffrey Epstein.  \n \nFormer Labour Deputy Leader Harriet Harman argues it could bring down the Prime Minister, questioning whether Starmer can survive the fallout or if it\u2019s already too late to reset his leadership.  \n \nShe says Starmer\u2019s response this week made him look \u201Cgullible and naive\u201D.  \n  \nBeth Rigby, Ruth Davidson and Harriet Harman discuss: \n  \n\u2022 Why the Mandelson appointment has caused such outrage \n\u2022 Whether Keir Starmer can recover politically \n\u2022 How power, loyalty and silence operate inside the political and media establishment \n\u2022 The network Mandelson built, and why it still matters today \n  \nThey also examine what this scandal says about modern British politics and accountability at the very top. \n  \nPeter Mandelson denies any wrongdoing and has apologised to the victims of Jeffrey Epstein. \n  \nFollow us wherever you get your podcasts. \n \nYou can WhatsApp the podcast at 07934 200 444 or email electoraldysfunction@sky.uk \n\nSUBSCRIBE to our YouTube channel for more videos: http://www.youtube.com/skynews \nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/skynews \nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/skynews \nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/skynews \nFollow us on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@skynews \n\nFor more content go to http://news.sky.com and download our apps: Apple https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/sky-news/id316391924?mt=8 Android https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bskyb.skynews.android\u0026hl=en_GB \n\nSky News Daily podcast is available for free here: https://podfollow.com/skynewsdaily/ \n\nTo enquire about licensing Sky News content, you can find more information here: https://news.sky.com/info/library-sales",
