And how did two senior Labour figures with links to convicted paedophiles pass vetting? \n\nKeir Starmer has made it through the week, but the paedophile vetting scandal surrounding Peter Mandelson and Matthew Doyle is intensifying, raising serious questions about judgement, standards and culture at the heart of government. \n\nIn this episode of Electoral Dysfunction, Beth Rigby, Ruth Davidson and Harriet Harman talk about: \n\nThe \u201Cboys\u2019 club\u201D allegations inside Downing Street \n\nWhether women are being pushed onto a political \u201Cglass cliff\u201D \n\nThe fallout from the Peter Mandelson scandal \n\nFresh scrutiny over Matthew Doyle\u2019s peerage and vetting failures \n\nWhat \u201Cstructural misogyny\u201D in government actually means \n\nHarriet Harman\u2019s proposal for a new First Secretary of State to drive culture change \n\nWe also reveal what really happened behind the scenes in the dramatic weekend that led to Morgan McSweeney\u2019s resignation and whether the Prime Minister is politically safe or simply buying time. \n\nThis episode dives into UK politics, Labour Party leadership, Downing Street culture, vetting failures and women in power. \n\nA source close to the prime minister rejected suggestions of a \u0022boys\u0027 club\u0022 in Downing Street, saying there were a number of \u0022highly qualified and capable women that work in Number 10\u0022 including cabinet ministers and special advisers \u0022across the whole government who are often forgotten in all of this\u0022. \n\nFollow us wherever you get your podcasts.  \n\nYou can WhatsApp the podcast at 07934 200 444 or email electoraldysfunction@sky.uk  \n\nSUBSCRIBE to our YouTube channel for more videos: http://www.youtube.com/skynews \nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/skynews \nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/skynews \nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/skynews \nFollow us on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@skynews \n\nFor more content go to http://news.sky.com and download our apps: Apple https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/sky-news/id316391924?mt=8 Android https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bskyb.skynews.android\u0026hl=en_GB \n\nSky News Daily podcast is available for free here: https://podfollow.com/skynewsdaily/ \n\nTo enquire about licensing Sky News content, you can find more information here: https://news.sky.com/info/library-sales",

      "description": "Could this be the scandal that ends Keir Starmer\u2019s career? \n \nThe Prime Minister is under fire in one of the biggest political scandals of the century after appointing Peter Mandelson, despite his links to Jeffrey Epstein.  \n \nFormer Labour Deputy Leader Harriet Harman argues it could bring down the Prime Minister, questioning whether Starmer can survive the fallout or if it\u2019s already too late to reset his leadership.  \n \nShe says Starmer\u2019s response this week made him look \u201Cgullible and naive\u201D.  \n  \nBeth Rigby, Ruth Davidson and Harriet Harman discuss: \n  \n\u2022 Why the Mandelson appointment has caused such outrage \n\u2022 Whether Keir Starmer can recover politically \n\u2022 How power, loyalty and silence operate inside the political and media establishment \n\u2022 The network Mandelson built, and why it still matters today \n  \nThey also examine what this scandal says about modern British politics and accountability at the very top. \n  \nPeter Mandelson denies any wrongdoing and has apologised to the victims of Jeffrey Epstein. \n  \nFollow us wherever you get your podcasts. \n \nYou can WhatsApp the podcast at 07934 200 444 or email electoraldysfunction@sky.uk \n\nSUBSCRIBE to our YouTube channel for more videos: http://www.youtube.com/skynews \nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/skynews \nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/skynews \nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/skynews \nFollow us on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@skynews \n\nFor more content go to http://news.sky.com and download our apps: Apple https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/sky-news/id316391924?mt=8 Android https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bskyb.skynews.android\u0026hl=en_GB \n\nSky News Daily podcast is available for free here: https://podfollow.com/skynewsdaily/ \n\nTo enquire about licensing Sky News content, you can find more information here: https://news.sky.com/info/library-sales",
