      "description": "For two years, the Queen of Canada cult terrorized the village of Richmound. For two years, the Sask. Party government took no action.\n\nThe village has spent tens of thousands of dollars on legal fees, infrastructure costs, and additional staffing costs after town employees were threatened and resigned from their positions.\n\nThe Saskatchewan NDP is calling on the Sask. Party government to immediately approve the mayor\u2019s request for $75,000 in emergency funding to help Richmound recover.",
