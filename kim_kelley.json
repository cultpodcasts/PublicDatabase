      "description": "I was born and raised in a religious cult. I survived 20 years of abuse, including child trafficking, extreme religious control, and systemic exploitation. But escaping was only the beginning.\n\nThrough my work in advocacy, law enforcement collaboration, and uncovering corruption, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how deep the darkness runs. I\u2019ve witnessed powerful people use nonprofits, law enforcement, and even anti-trafficking organizations as fronts to exploit the very issue they claim to fight.\n\nWhen I realized no one was coming to save us, I stopped waiting.\nNow, I work alongside law enforcement, tech experts, and policymakers to protect children, expose corruption, and bring real solutions to the fight against exploitation.\n\nBut speaking the truth comes at a cost. After blowing the whistle on fraud, mismanagement, and unethical behavior within an anti-trafficking nonprofit, I became the target of slander, lies, and retaliation.\n\nThis is the story they don\u2019t want you to hear.\nThis is why I fight.\nAnd this is why I won\u2019t stop.\n\n\uD83D\uDCA1 If you believe in protecting children, exposing corruption, and standing up for the truth, subscribe now. This is just the beginning.\n\n#KimKelley #Whistleblower #ExposeCorruption #Survivor #ProtectChildren #JusticeForSurvivors #TraumaToTriumph #EndExploitation #FightingForTruth",

      "description": "POV: Why don\u0027t we see Christians on the front lines of protecting children from exploitation? As a child trafficking survivor raised in a Christian cult, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how faith can be manipulated\u2014and how many churches stay silent when they should be leading the fight.\n\nIn this video, I\u2019m sharing my personal story and challenging the church to step up, lead by example, and take real action to protect the innocent. This isn\u2019t about attacking faith\u2014it\u2019s about holding people accountable to the values they preach.\n\nAre churches speaking out? Are they doing anything to confront child exploitation?\n\nYou tell me: where are the real Christians? \nLet\u2019s talk about it. \uD83D\uDC47\n\n\n#UnfilteredTruth #ProtectChildren #ExposingCults #FaithInAction #ChildSafety #Christianity #JusticeForVictims #ReligiousTrauma #SurvivorStories #ChildProtection #Christianity #ReligiousTrauma #FaithInAction",
