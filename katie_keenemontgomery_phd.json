      "description": "Cults form through the same social processes that shape religions, organizations, and political movements: belonging, leadership, identity, ritual, and meaning.\n\nIn this video, using an anthropological lens, I explore how high-control groups build power, examine how authority forms, how group identity evolves, and how ordinary people become drawn into tightly structured systems.\n\nThanks for your time!\n\n#anthropology #cults #socialscience #powerdynamics",
