      "description": "Something feel off at work but hard to explain why?\n\nSometimes it starts with small things like feeling afraid to speak up, being rewarded for staying quiet, or slowly losing touch with who you are. It\u2019s subtle, but over time, it can chip away at confidence, peace of mind, and even your sense of identity.\n\nThis video explores how toxic work cultures can mirror high-control environments and how those unspoken rules can impact mental health more than most people realize. From silent pressure to unspoken expectations, these patterns are more common than many think and easier to miss when they\u2019ve been normalized.\n\nIf burnout, self-doubt, or emotional disconnection have become the norm at work, this might help connect the dots.\n\nAnd if the question \u201CAm I really in control of my choices?\u201D has ever come up, it\u2019s worth watching until the end.",
