      "title": "Russell Brand And The Conspiracy Grift",
      "description": "Russell Brand was once considered a \u0022hero of the left,\u0022 criticizing Fox News and corporate media for their sensational and fear-driven coverage. Now, he\u0027s gone full conspiracy theorist, buddying up with the same right-wingers he used to criticize. His evolution is a great example of \u0022grift drift\u0022 -- how so-called \u0022free thinkers\u0022 get pulled towards extremism in order to get views and make money. \n\nMedia Matters watches the bullshit so you don\u0027t have to. \nmediamatters.org\ntwitter.com/mmfa\ninstagram.com/mediamattersforamerica",
