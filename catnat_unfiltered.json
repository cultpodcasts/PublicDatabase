      "description": "Since we\u0027ve been chatting about cults lately we wanted to bring back our episode with ex-NXIVM members Sarah and Nippy from A Little Bit Culty. This is an honest conversation about manipulation, the abuse of power and red flags. We could have done a whole other episode on multi-level marketing but for now we will leave you with two A Little Bit Culty episodes that discuss their view on MLM\u0027s.

      "description": "On today\u2019s podcast we did a deep dive into Dancing for the Devil, the Netflix show about an alleged cult linked to the founder of 7M Films, a talent management company for TikTok dancers. At what point do your children stop listening to you as a parent? It just goes to show how powerful the love for a partner can be compared to that of a parent or family member.
