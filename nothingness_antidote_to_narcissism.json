      "description": "Increasingly more grandiose, people are injured and humiliated by and shun the truly intelligent, expert, knowledgeable, and insightful. They opt for ersatz fake gold.\n\nIt is not surprising that the latter - the Western trickster \u0022coaches\u0022 and conspiracy theorists - often quote the former (the Indian phonies) . They are specimen of the same family of lethal intellectual viruses in human form.\n\nThere is a tsunami of mental health disorders heading our way. It is projected to affect at least half the population, in all age groups.\n\nBut there are two additional waves inexorably coursing to our already dilapidated shores: irrationality and grandiosity.\n\nBuy most of my books in Amazon https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/60F8EC8A-5812-4007-9F2C-DFA02EA713B3",
