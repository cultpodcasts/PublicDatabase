      "description": "Whew, I kind of can\u0027t believe I\u0027m pressing publish on this one. I grew up in a high control religious organization, and today I\u0027m sharing my story after a lot of interest came in after I mentioned it in a reel! \n\nI know this is a bit off the subject of decluttering, but it ties in beautifully with the bigger message of intentional living. I hope this episode is not only interesting, but helps shed some light on the importance of being intentional about our beliefs by making them our own.\n\nParing Down Podcast Instagram: \u2060\u2060@paring_down\u2060 (https://www.instagram.com/paring_down/)\n\nParing Down Newsletter: (https://www.theexpertbeginner.com/new-page-4)\n\nParing Down Blog: (https://www.theexpertbeginner.com/posts-copy)\n\nShannon\u0027s book, You\u0027re Completely Normal (https://amzn.to/4haeXuF)\n\nMENTIONED IN THIS EPISODE:\nThe Ruthless Elimination of Hurry by John Mark Comer (https://amzn.to/4h38rWm)\n\nParing Down Resources: (https://stan.store/Shannon-Leyko_)\n\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060Complete Guide to Decluttering Kid Stuff\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\n\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060Free Know Your Why Worksheet \u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\n\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060Free Baby Essentials List\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\n\u2060Free 15 Clutter-Free Gift Ideas\u2060\n\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060Gift Request Template\n\nCODES:\n\n15% off all Lume products like aluminum free deodorant at lumedeodorant.com (https://lumedeodorant.com/) - use code PARING\n\n40% off luxurious Cozy Earth bamboo bedding and pajamas: (https://cozyearth.com - use code PARING)\n\n$300 off Air Doctor Pro air purifier: (https://airdoctorpro.com/) - Use code PARING\n\n20% OFF any AquaTru water purifier: (https://aquatruwater.com/) - use promo code PARING\n\nEthical, luxury women\u0027s clothing from Quince: (https://www.quince.com/women/best-sellers?utm_source=veritone\u0026utm_medium=podcast\u0026utm_campaign=paring) for 365-day returns, plus free shipping on your order! \n\n10 Free Meals from Hello Fresh: (https://www.hellofresh.com/plans?c=HELLOFRESHPODCAST\u0026discount_comm_id=c4f27a33-2142-4f2b-97b5-86a940526cb8\u0026mealsize=3-2\u0026utm_campaign=podcastfpfl\u0026utm_content=act_podcast_podcastads\u0026utm_medium=cpm\u0026utm_source=podcast)\n\nThis episode is brought to you by Better Help. 10% off your first month of Better Help therapy: (https://www.betterhelp.com/paring)\n\n15% off your first order at PACT (sustainable, ethical clothing): https://wearpact.com/ - Use code PARINGDOWN\n\n10% Swirise red light therapy device: https://swirise.com/ - Use code SHANNON10",
