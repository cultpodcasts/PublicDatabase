      "description": "William Branham, who died in 1965, is still the central figure of a cult called The End Time Message.  He had a lot to say about women--expressing his hostility and disdain for us.  He talked about struggling with the urge to kill us, among many other things.  I\u0027ve included some links to a Youtube channel exposing the cult, as well as books on Amazon exposing this false prophet.\n\nhttps://youtube.com/@leavingthemessage?si=G5_gUczZmzMpJ4R2  Here is a link to the Youtube channel, Leaving the Message, which exposes this cult and William Branham.  \n\nhttps://amzn.to/4hB1RWT  This is a link to a book on Amazon called Preacher Behind the White Hoods by John Collins that exposes William Branham.\n\nhttps://amzn.to/4kPsNFd  This is a link to a book on Amazon called Come Out of Her My People by Charles Paisley, a former message minister.\n\nhttps://amzn.to/4kXdrP5   This is a link to a book on Amazon called Under the Halo by Rod Bergen, another book that exposes William Branham\n\nhttps://amzn.to/4kXdOcr   This is a link to a book on Amazon called Investigating William Branham: The Unfolding of Plagiarisms and Errors by Bryan Smalls\n\nIf you buy any of these books through these links, I will receive a small commission, but it will not increase the price you pay for the book.",
