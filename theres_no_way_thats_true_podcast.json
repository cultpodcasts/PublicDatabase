      "description": "This episode is one of my favorites yet \u2014 because my husband joins me! \u2764\uFE0F\nWe open up about how we met, how completely opposite our worlds were, and how forbidden our relationship was under the control of the IFB cult. From secret phone calls to being banned from seeing each other, to finally breaking free and building a life together \u2014 it\u2019s funny, crazy, and a little unbelievable.\n\nEven though the manipulation and control we faced were intense, we can finally laugh about it now. You\u2019ll hear stories about what it was like trying to date under the IFB\u2019s watchful eye, the wild rules we had to follow, and yes\u2026 the moment lizard people and tin foil hats somehow got involved \uD83E\uDD23\n\nThis episode is a mix of humor, healing, and hope \u2014 showing that love and resilience really can win, even in the most extreme circumstances.\n\n\uD83D\uDC47 Links \u0026 Ways to Connect:\n\uD83D\uDCFA Subscribe so you don\u2019t miss new episodes about unbelievable true stories\n\uD83D\uDCE7 Email: maryrosetruel@gmail.com\n\uD83D\uDCAC Follow for updates and behind-the-scenes clips",
