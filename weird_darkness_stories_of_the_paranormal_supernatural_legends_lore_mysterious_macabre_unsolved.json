      "description": "Heaven\u2019s Gate wasn\u2019t just another doomsday cult\u2014it was a chilling fusion of sci-fi, Christian prophecy, and absolute control that led 39 people to their final, otherworldly exit. IN THIS EPISODE: Following an anonymous tip, police enter a mansion in Rancho Santa Fe, an exclusive suburb of San Diego, California, and discover 39 victims of a mass suicide. The deceased\u201321 women and 18 men of varying ages\u2013were all found lying peaceably in matching dark clothes and Nike sneakers and had no noticeable signs of blood or trauma. It was later revealed that the men and women were members of the \u201CHeaven\u2019s Gate\u201D religious cult, whose leaders preached that suicide would allow them to leave their bodily \u201Ccontainers\u201D and enter an alien spacecraft hidden behind the Hale-Bopp comet. *** PLUS, the creepy true-crime story of two men who were caught trying to steal the body of the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. But that is by no means the end of this story full of twists, turns, myths, and conspiracies.

      "description": "The Hamilton-Byrne family was anything but typical, rather it was a doomsday cult with a leader who believed herself to be the reincarnation of Jesus Christ. (Inside the Family Cult) *** On this date, October 24, 1953, Evelyn Hartley, a 15-year-old sophomore from La Crosse, Wisconsin, vanished without a trace while on her way to a babysitting job. It was like something out of a Halloween urban legend but in this case, the horror was real. (The Babysitter Who Vanished) *** The odd happening that takes place here and there in a house more than likely can be explained in some rational way. Even quite a few strange occurrences could probably be explained by science. But when the events seem to never stop, perhaps it\u2019s time to think something else is going on. (An Assortment of Experiences) *** Legend tells a centuries-old curse was placed upon Dudleytown in Connecticut. The town turned into a horrible place where people committed suicide or went insane. (Cursed Dudleytown) *** Exactly 92 years ago today \u2013 October 24, 1926 - something went wrong during a performance by Harry Houdini. A week later, he would be dead. (Houdini\u0027s Final Performance) *** In the Oakland Cemetery, a bronze monument to tragedy is said to bring death to anyone who touches it. (Black Angel of Death) *** While camping, a man has dreams of a dark-haired woman several nights in a row. Normally it wouldn\u2019t be anything to be all that concerned about, but it\u2019s something to fear if you are near the French Broad river. (Siren of the French Broad) *** Alien visitors, beings from a different dimension, our planet even had tree monsters and sentient pyramids showing up \u2013 and all in the year 1965. (The Inter-Dimensional Interlopers of 1965) *** A retired naval officer reports rocks falling through his home\u2019s roof \u2013 dozens in a single day \u2013 with no explanation of where they came from. (Cappy Ricks and the Stones) *** In 1994 a man has a paranormal experience with a popular song recorded two decades earlier. (The Joker) *** Is there a clandestine space program designed to save the elite from a global catastrophe?
