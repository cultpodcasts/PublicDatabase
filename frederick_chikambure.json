      "description": "In this video, I explore the psychological impact of being raised in a system where obedience, fear, and external authority replaced intuition, preference, and self-trust.\n\nAs a former Jehovah\u2019s Witness, I learned very early that my inner voice wasn\u2019t welcome \u2014 and many people who grew up in strict religious or controlling environments share this experience.\n\nToday we go deeper into:\n- why your intuition went quiet\n- how your nervous system adapted to survive\n- why decisions feel emotionally risky\nand how you can slowly begin reconnecting with your true inner voice again\n\nThis is the bridge between understanding why decision-making feels difficult (yesterday\u2019s video) and moving toward rebuilding self-trust and clarity.\n\nIf this resonates with your journey \u2014 whether you\u2019re an ex-JW, ex-Christian, or anyone recovering from control \u2014 you\u2019re not alone.",

      "description": "Many former Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses struggle to trust their own decisions after leaving \u2014 not because we\u2019re weak, but because we were trained to outsource every choice to an organization, elders, or doctrine. In this video, I talk about what happens to your inner voice in a high-control environment, why decision-making feels scary after you leave, and how we slowly rebuild independence and confidence again",
