I still can\u0027t believe I did this!! \n\nThe EDGE / CITY CLIMB is an extreme, adrenaline-pumping attraction in New York City, located at The Edge in Hudson Yards. It offers a thrilling experience where participants can actually scale the outside of the building at 30 Hudson Yards, one of the tallest skyscrapers in the city. It\u0027s the highest external building climb in the world, allowing climbers to walk along the outside of the skyscraper without walls or windows around them.\n\nHere\u2019s whatThe EDGE / CITY CLIMB involves:\n\nClimbing Gear: \nParticipants are strapped into safety harnesses and equipped with helmets, allowing them to scale the exterior of the building under the guidance of professional instructors.\n\nAscent and Descent: \nThe climb begins with ascending a series of open-air platforms that gradually take you higher. Eventually, participants can reach the apex of the skyscraper, around 1,200 feet above the ground.\n\nThe Lean: \nAt the highest point, climbers can lean out over the edge of the building for an exhilarating view of the city below.\n\nIncredible Views: \nIt provides breathtaking 360\u00B0 views of NYC, but with the added thrill of being fully outside and exposed to the elements. It\u2019s designed for thrill-seekers who want to push the limits of heights and enjoy a one-of-a-kind experience in New York City.\n\nHere are some key highlights of The Edge Observation Deck:\n\nGlass Floor: \nOne of the main attractions is a glass floor section that allows you to look directly down at the streets below.\n\nAngled Glass Walls: \nThe glass panels are designed at an angle, so you can lean out slightly for an even more thrilling view.\n\n360\u00B0 Views: \nThe Edge offers stunning, panoramic views of the New York City skyline, including landmarks like the Empire State Building, Central Park, the Statue of Liberty, and the Hudson River.\n\nI\u2019m excited for what\u2019s next and can\u0027t wait to take you along for the ride. Every challenge, every adventure, and every new experience is a step toward living the life I\u2019ve always dreamed of\u2014free, fearless, and full of possibilities.\n\nSo, buckle up! This is just the beginning, and together, we\u2019ll push boundaries, face fears, and redefine what it means to truly live.

      "description": "Welcome to my very first video on Becoming Justin! Honestly, I\u2019m nervous\u2014sharing this part of my life is terrifying, but it\u2019s a story I need to tell. In this video, I\u2019m opening up about one of the hardest decisions I\u2019ve ever made: leaving the Jehovah\u0027s Witness religion, coming out as gay and embracing my true self. It wasn\u2019t an easy journey, and in the process, I lost my family and community, but I gained something invaluable: the freedom to live authentically. \n\nIn this two-part video, I\u2019ll share my story of breaking away from a life that once confined me and how I\u2019m now building a future full of self-love, new experiences, and bold adventures. Whether you\u2019ve been in a similar situation or are just here to learn, I hope my story inspires you to live fearlessly and unapologetically.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to subscribe and hit the notification bell to be part of my adventure.
