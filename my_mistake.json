      "description": "Why look forward to a new year when we can look back on an old episode? Not all cults are created equal. We discuss three lesser known ones - The Aetherius Society, Ho No Hana and the cargo cult John Frum - so we can learn from their mistakes.\u00A0 Anne Hicks-Bleecker is our editor and our theme song is by the amazing musician and composer Kitch Membery. Check out his music at KitchMusic.com. Please subscribe and review! You can find us on Instagram @mymistakepodcast and on Facebook at My Mistake, The Podcast.
