There is no central authority in control of Umbanda, which is organized around autonomous places of worship termed\u00A0centros\u00A0or\u00A0terreiros, and is broadly divided between White Umbanda, which is closer to Spiritism, and Africanized Umbanda, which is closer to Candombl\u00E9.

      "description": "The Order of the Solar Temple (French: Ordre du Temple solaire, OTS) and the International Chivalric Organization of the Solar Tradition, or simply The Solar Temple, is a cult and religious sect[1] that claims to be based upon the ideals of the Knights Templar. OTS was founded by Joseph di Mambro and Luc Jouret in 1984 in Geneva, as l\u0027Ordre International Chevaleresque de Tradition Solaire (OICTS), and later it was renamed Ordre du Temple Solaire. It is associated with a series of murders and mass suicides that claimed several dozen lives in France, Switzerland, and Canada in 1994 and 1995.[2] The Good:   Great lightshow.  Very committed followers.  The Bad:    Suicide   Murders   Picking a Anti-Christ who is under 6 months old.  The Culty (is there anything in this cult worth incorporating into our own?):    The Nice Cult takes on Knighting Ceremony. \u00A0Those Knighted by the Nice Cult will be known as the Knights of Nice.   We also take on calling our meeting place Club Archedia in place of The Man Cave or Dungeon.

      "description": "What is the Mom I Joined a Cult Podcast about? Leave a Comment / Uncategorized / By thenicecult Each week a group of friends (Thor, Gunnar, Nathan, and on occasion Don) get together and discuss cults. We talk about their history, belief system, practices, and leader. Then we decide what they got right, what they got wrong, and then choose something from the cult that we can incorporate into our own parody cult \u201CThe Nice Cult\u201D. We usually choose something harmless or fun (like a feast day, or a celebration). On occasion we just can\u2019t find any redeeming qualities at all and choose not to incorporate anything. Even though cults can be a serious topic, we try to find humor where we can and provide insight and information we gather from our research. The Good: No perceived sexual acts, short lived, low key. The Bad: Prophecy, end of world date, saved the world and then fizzled out. The Culty: The Nice Cult adopts an Infallible leader (Renaldo DiCaprio) and decide to create a mythos about him. \u00A0  You can listen on the following podcatchers: Itunes: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mom-i-joined-a-cult/id1565633523 Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/4ALQPCNu2QLsDCXEhsYTzh Anchor: https://anchor.fm/thenicecult The Nice Cult: https://thenicecult.com This episode is sponsored by \u00B7 Anchor: The easiest way to make a podcast. https://anchor.fm/app",
