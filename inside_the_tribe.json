      "description": "Anthony is heartbroken. He has seen his family just once since he left the Twelve Tribes community in Kansas last year. But when he tries to reach out to them, he realises his worst fears have been confirmed. We look to the past to learn what the group has done to other parents who couldn\u0027t stay inside the Community, and what it\u0027s all got to do with the extraordinary story of the Twelve Tribes meeting Jerry Springer.

One day at a local fair, they come across a Christian sect called the 12 Tribes.\u00A0 The group, who live in seclusion, offer a utopia of love, peace and communal living, beholden only to the word of Yashua. But before long, Mark and Rose find themselves in a world of bizarre rituals and extreme beliefs, under the influence of a charismatic leader. They are made virtual slaves, the family shuffled around the world to prevent them escaping. So who are the 12 Tribes, and how has their leader managed to build a global following, unchecked for 50 years? Coming 29 November 2022 Have a tip of information about 12 Tribes?
