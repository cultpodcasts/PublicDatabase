      "description": "Reggie Yates\u2019 Extreme - South Africa: The Millionaire Preacher \n\nReggie Yates\u2019 Extreme - UK: Gay and Under Attack: https://youtu.be/Iw5wPzFCqVU\n\nSouth Africa is a country devoted to God. But forget priests and bishops, many people here go direct to a Prophet for their faith. Reggie is spending a week with one of the most controversial and colourful of them all- Prophet Mboro. \n\nMboro is adored by the thousands of followers in his megachurch and renowned as much for his wacky breakdancing as the \u2018miracles\u2019 he performs. It\u2019s a crazy world of witchcraft, exorcisms and AK-47s, but even here can a multi-millionaire King of Bling with 30 flash cars really be a messenger from God? Reggie has already rejected a Pentecostal faith once in his life, and he\u2019s soon determined to expose this showman \u2018charlatan\u2019. But the deeper Reggie digs, the more conflicted he becomes- until he starts to confront some truths much closer to home.\n\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\nSubscribe Free Documentary Channel for free: https://bit.ly/2YJ4XzQ\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/free.documentary/\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\n\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\n#FreeDocumentary #Documentary #ReggieYates\n\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bringing high-class documentaries to you on YouTube for free.
