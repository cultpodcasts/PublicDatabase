There were some red flags, and I would love to know if you see them the same way. Please share your thoughts in the comments below!\n\nAlso, I have a much better filming setup now! Quality should be more consistent and even better moving forward :)\n\nThis video contains copyrighted material used under the fair use doctrine for commentary and educational purposes.",
