      "description": "A Russian cult leader who claimed to be the reincarnation of Jesus Christ has been sentenced to 12 years in a maximum-security prison. Sergei Torop, known to followers as \u0022Vissarion,\u0022 founded the Church of the Last Testament in Siberia in 1991 and attracted thousands to his remote commune. Russian authorities say Torop and two aides used psychological manipulation to control followers, causing serious mental and physical harm and defrauding them of money. The court also ordered over $570,000 in compensation to victims. The trio was arrested in a dramatic 2020 raid by Russian security forces. All three denied wrongdoing.\n\n----\n\nRussia | Jesus Christ | Siberia | Vissarion | Firstpost America | Eric Ham | War | Geopolitics | Global Economy | Firstpost | World News | Latest News | Global News | International News | Trending News\n\n#russia #jesus #siberia #vissarion #firstpostamerica #ericham #war #geopolitics #economy #firstpost #worldnews #latestnews #globalnews #internationalnews #trendingnews\n\nFirstpost is an Indian news and media website.
