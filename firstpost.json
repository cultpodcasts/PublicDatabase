      "description": "Melinda Gates Breaks Silence on Bill Gates\u0027 Mention in Epstein Files\n\nMelinda French Gates has reacted after renewed attention on Jeffrey Epstein-linked documents again placed her former husband, Bill Gates, under scrutiny. Epstein, a US financier and convicted sex offender,\u00A0maintained\u00A0ties with powerful figures even after his 2008 conviction and died in jail in 2019. Bill Gates has acknowledged meeting Epstein, calling it a \u201Cmistake,\u201D and has denied any wrongdoing. In recent remarks, Melinda French Gates said the resurfacing details are personally painful and revive difficult memories from their\u00A0nearly three-decade-long\u00A0marriage. She drew a clear line, saying unanswered questions about Epstein and\u00A0Gates\u2019\u00A0past associations are for him to address. The Gates divorced in 2021 after 27 years, with Melinda previously\u00A0indicating\u00A0Epstein-related concerns contributed to the breakdown of the marriage.\u00A0\n\n---\n\nMelinda French Gates | Bill Gates | Jeffrey Epstein | Epstein documents | Epstein scandal | Bill Gates Epstein ties | Gates divorce | Gates marriage | Melinda Gates statement | Epstein resurfacing | Epstein investigation | Sex offender case | Billionaire scrutiny | Philanthropy controversy | Microsoft founder | Gates Foundation | 2021 Gates divorce | Firstpost America | Cary Johnston | War | Geopolitics | Global Economy | Firstpost | World News | Latest News | Global News | International News | Trending News \n\n#MelindaFrenchGates #BillGates #JeffreyEpstein #EpsteinDocuments #EpsteinScandal #GatesDivorce #BillionaireNews #HighProfileFigures #GatesFoundation #Microsoft #GlobalNews #USNews #Philanthropy #BreakingNews #firstpostamerica #caryjohnston #war #geopolitics #economy #firstpost #worldnews #latestnews #globalnews #internationalnews #trendingnews\n\n\nFirstpost is an Indian news and media website.

      "description": "Newly released US Justice Department documents have reignited scrutiny of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, following the publication of previously unseen photographs. The images, with children\u2019s identities obscured, show Epstein in close proximity to very young children and have raised fresh concerns about how long alleged abuses went unchecked. Officials say the children appear younger than those referenced in Epstein\u2019s 2008 plea deal, though no identities or victim status have been confirmed. The release follows claims that early warnings to authorities were ignored. Some files were briefly removed for review, including images of President Donald Trump, drawing political criticism. Overall, the disclosure underscores lingering questions that remain.  \n\n---\n\nDonald Trump | Jeffrey Epstein | Epstein Files | Firstpost America | Eric Ham | War | Geopolitics | Global Economy | Firstpost | World News | Latest News | Global News | International News | Trending News \n\n#donaldtrump #epsteinfiles #jeffreyepstein #firstpostamerica #ericham #war #geopolitics #economy #firstpost #worldnews #latestnews #globalnews #internationalnews #trendingnews\n\nFirstpost is an Indian news and media website.

      "title": "Epstein Files LIVE: Gloria Allred, Victims Urge Congress to Release DOJ Records Ahead of Key Vote",
      "description": "Attorney Gloria Allred and alleged Jeffrey Epstein victim Alicia Arden held a press conference on Monday (November 17) urging Congress to release the investigative files on Epstein. \u0022My hope is that finally, these files will be released. And those who were complicit in Jeffrey Epstein\u0027s crimes will finally be named, and the American public will get the transparency that they\u0027ve been promised, and which we all deserve,\u0022 said Arden. The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives will vote on Tuesday on forcing the release of investigative files on the late sex offender Epstein, with passage seen as all but guaranteed after President Donald Trump dropped his longstanding opposition. Trump\u0027s reversal late on Sunday came days after a House petition gathered enough support to force a vote, a rare instance of House Republicans defying the president\u0027s wishes. Until the weekend, Trump and his staff had lobbied hard to prevent any further release of files from the criminal investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into Epstein, a wealthy New York financier who was, for a time, friends with Trump. Democrats, and even some of Trump\u0027s supporters, say there is nothing hoax-like in the release of authentic Justice Department records. Epstein was convicted on Florida state and federal charges related to his sexual abuse and trafficking of teenaged girls. He died in a federal jail cell in Manhattan in 2019 in what was ruled a suicide, a few weeks after he was arrested on new federal charges of sex trafficking children. Supporters of the files\u0027 release say they also share this concern, and the resolution on which House lawmakers will vote says the Justice Department may withhold or redact the identifying information of victims. If the House passes the resolution, it would move to the Senate, which would also need to vote on it before sending it to Trump to sign. Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune\u0027s office declined to comment on plans for the bill.\n\n---\n\nFirstpost | News Live | World News | Latest News | Global News | International News | News | Trending News\n\n#firstpost #newslive #worldnews #latestnews #globalnews #news #internationalnews #trendingnews\n\nFirstpost is an Indian news and media website.

The move, reportedly backed by the royal family, follows renewed public outrage over Andrew\u2019s links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

      "description": "Kenya Hands Over Bodies of 429 Cult Members, its Head Paul Mackenzie Awaits Trial | Firstpost America\n\nThe Kenyan government has begun handing over the remains of the people who were found dead in the Shakahola forest. These people were members of the cult led by Paul Mackenzie and his wife. He convinced these people to starve themselves and their children to death to meet Jesus. The bodies of these people were unearthed by the police who were buried together in groups in mass graves. Some bodies even had internal organs missing. The police arrested Mackenzie in 2023 and charged him with manslaughter, terrorism, and murder. He is currently serving a yearlong jail sentence for illegally running a studio.\n\n---\n\nKenya | Cult Leader | Paul Mackenzie | Shakahola Forest | Massacre | Firstpost America | Eric Ham | War | Geopolitics | Global Economy | Firstpost | World News | Latest News | Global News | International News | Trending News \n\n#kenya #cultleader #paulmackenzie #shakahola #forest #massacre #firstpostamerica #ericham #war #geopolitics #economy #firstpost #worldnews #latestnews #globalnews #internationalnews #trendingnews \n\nFirstpost is an Indian news and media website.
