      "description": "Trigger Warning: This episode contains discussions of childhood sexual abuse, religious trauma, suicide attempts, and domestic violence. Please listen with care.\n\nIn this powerful episode of Dysfunctional, Karinne shares her story of surviving a childhood shaped by the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses \u2014 a group she now calls a cult \u2014 and parents who were both abusive and narcissistic.\n\nKicked out at 16 after being groomed and blamed for it, Karinne found herself completely alone in the world, trauma-bonded to the very people who harmed her, and struggling to make sense of a reality she was never prepared for.\n\nWhat follows is a conversation about real healing \u2014 not the Instagram version with matcha and mantras, but the messy, angry, beautiful kind that happens when you start telling the truth.\n\nTogether we explore:\n\nWhat it\u2019s like growing up in a high-control religious cult\nThe impact of narcissistic parenting and spiritual abuse\nPurity culture, fear-based control, and enforced submission\nThe trauma bond and why it\u2019s so hard to break\nWhat healing actually looks like \u2014 day-to-day, years on\nKarinne is funny, fierce, and real. She\u2019s not here to sugarcoat anything. This is what healing sounds like in real life.\n\n\uD83D\uDCF2 Connect with Karinne on insta - @girl_inshambles",
