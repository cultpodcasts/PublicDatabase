      "description": "One January day in 1975, seven-year-old Guinevere Turner put on her best dress, hugged her favorite toy tightly, and waited for the spaceship to arrive. The world was ending and she would be saved, spirited away to Venus with the rest of her enormous and enlightened family.\n\n\n\nWhen the prophecy failed, the cult carried on. But Guinevere would soon find herself thrown out into the world beyond, where things somehow became more nightmarish than before.\n\n\n\nIn this episode, Guinevere Turner joins us to talk about her remarkable memoir, When the World Didn\u0027t End (https://amzn.to/4h72isd) .\n\n\n\nNote: This episode includes discussion of psychological manipulation and sexual abuse.
