      "description": "Don\u0027t just remember the tragedy\u2014understand the trap. Author and Academic, Annie Dawid, talks about the true and often-ignored story of the Peoples Temple. We discuss the inner circle of Jim Jones, the racism and strict hierarchy hiding behind the promise of \u0022equality,\u0022 and the lasting impact on Guyana. A vital look at cult dynamics that serves as a chilling reminder: no one is immune.
