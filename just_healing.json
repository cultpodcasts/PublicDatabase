      "description": "In this episode, Dr. Debra explores the less-sensationalized side of cults with Ashley Easter, the resilient founder of Courage365 and a survivor of a high-control religious group. Together, they delve into the complexities of defining and categorizing cults. Ashley candidly discusses her personal experience growing up in a highly controlled religious community, providing insights into the numerous layers of control she navigated. Emphasizing the importance of critical thinking and trusting one\u0027s intuition when confronted with cult dynamics, Ashley also extends valuable resources and support for survivors as she highlights her impactful efforts in empowering individuals through coaching and education.
