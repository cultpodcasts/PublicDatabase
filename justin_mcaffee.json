      "description": "Michelle Dowd, author of Forager: Field Notes for Surviving a Family Cult, joins me to talk about survival, nature, and escaping systems of control. She\u2019s been featured on shows like Joe Rogan.\n\nWe found common ground on seeing both family and culture as cult-like systems. Our conversation dives into creative survival, land connection, and what it means to reclaim your voice after leaving control.\n\nCollapse Curriculum is survival education for a collapsing world.\n\uD83D\uDCE9 Subscribe: https://collapsecurriculum.substack.com/\n for lessons the system will never teach you.",
