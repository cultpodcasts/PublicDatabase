      "description": "This documentary follows a group of young adult dancers and social media influencers with large TikTok and Instagram followings who unwittingly become part of a cult led by Robert Shinn. This cult extended to Shinn\u0027s church, Shekinah Church, in Los Angeles, California. Concerned parents race against time to uncover the truth behind the 7M Cult and rescue their children before it\u0027s too late. Sisters Melanie and Priscylla Lee, who were effectively orphaned as children and taken in by Shekinah, only to be abused for decades, are also featured. They file a lawsuit against Shinn and Shekinah for damages for theirs and others\u0027 years of abuse.\nWe have a PATREON! click on link below to check out the extra content:\nPatreon\nPlease SUBSCRIBE to the podcast and give us a 5-star rating and review.\nWe are on\u00A0Instagram\u00A0and\u00A0TikTok\u00A0@psychlegalpop\nEmail:\u00A0psychlegalpoppodcast@gmail.com\n\n Hosted on Acast.
