      "description": "Welcome to the Digital Diaries of my life.  \n\nOn this channel I share stories from my past experience in a cult, navigating an abusive marriage and divorce, while sharing my current lifestyle of traveling and running my online business. \n\nIn part two of this video, I\u2019m opening up about what it was like growing up in the cult known as the Quiver-full movement and my scary escape. This cult  closely follows the dangerous teachings of Bill Gothard\u2019s ministries. \n(click here for part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU_dpaw5tEE\u0026t=229s)\n\nThese beliefs are connected to the Duggar family from the hit TV show \u002219 Kids and Counting\u0022 as well as the documentary on Amazon Prime called \u0022Shiny Happy People: Duggar Family Secrets\u0022. \n\nI escaped the religious cult when I was 20, and now, six years later, after much therapy and encouragement I\u2019m sharing my story to inspire and help others that have been through similar things.  \n\nIn this series, I go behind the scenes and share the deep dark secrets of what life was really like, the strict beliefs we followed, and how I found the strength to leave and rebuild my life.  \n\nIf you\u2019re into lifestyle content, business tips, or travel vlogs, subscribe to join the Diamond Community for more cult stories and my crazy adventures. \uD83C\uDF0D\u2728  \n\n\uD83D\uDCAC Let\u2019s connect\u2014drop a comment below if anything resonates and any questions you may have for a future video. \n\nFollow me on all the socials https://linktr.ee/hannahxabba for more daily updates and behind-the-scenes content.\n\nMy business: www.diamondmktggroup.com\nFor business inquiries email us at:\ninfo@diamondmktggroup.com \n\nWatch Shiny Happy People: Duggar Family Secrets: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B8TR2QV5\n\nYou\u2019re so welcome and safe here. \uD83E\uDD0D",
