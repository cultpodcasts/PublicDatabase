      "description": "In this video I share the reality of my struggles with C-PTSD and anxiety after leaving the extreme abusive religious cult. Through years of therapy with professionals, I have built some routines to help me work through the hard days and work towards better days. \n\nI am not a doctor. All routines and recommendations are based on my unique experience and how I am working through healing. If you have anxiety or C-PTSD please reach out to a professional to find whats right for you. \n\nWelcome to the Digital Diaries of my life.  \n\nOn this channel I share stories from my past experience in a cult, navigating an abusive marriage and divorce, while sharing my current lifestyle of traveling and running my online business. \n\nTo learn more about the cult check out my playlist. The beliefs are connected to the Duggar family from the hit TV show \u002219 Kids and Counting\u0022 as well as the documentary on Amazon Prime called \u0022Shiny Happy People: Duggar Family Secrets\u0022. \n\nI escaped the religious cult when I was 20, and now, six years later, after much therapy and encouragement I\u2019m sharing my story to inspire and help others that have been through similar things.  \n\nI go behind the scenes and share the deep dark secrets of what life was really like, the strict beliefs we followed, and how I found the strength to leave and rebuild my life.  \n\nIf you\u2019re into lifestyle content, business tips, or travel vlogs, subscribe to join the Diamond Community for more cult stories and my crazy adventures. \uD83C\uDF0D\u2728  \n\n\uD83D\uDCAC Let\u2019s connect\u2014drop a comment below if anything resonates and any questions you may have for a future video. \n\nFollow me on all the socials https://linktr.ee/hannahxabba for more daily updates and behind-the-scenes content.\n\nMy business: www.diamondmktggroup.com\nFor business inquiries email us at:\ninfo@diamondmktggroup.com \n\nWatch Shiny Happy People: Duggar Family Secrets: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B8TR2QV5\n\nYou\u2019re so welcome and safe here. \uD83E\uDD0D",
