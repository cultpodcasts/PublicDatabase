He himself is married with five children, who live in the family home thirty feet away.\n\nDaily life in his order centres on devotion, prayer, fishing and Hawaii Five-0 (or Kojak, depending on what day it is).\n\nA man of both vision and practicality, he explains here how he balances what may seem the conflicting aspects of his life.\n\n\nClip taken from Nationwide: Another Ireland, originally broadcast on BBC One, Friday 25 August,  1978.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have now entered the BBC Archive, a time machine that will transport you back to the golden age of TV to educate, entertain and enlighten you with classic clips from the BBC vaults.\n\nMake sure you subscribe so that you never miss a single stop on our amazing journey through the BBC Archive - https://www.youtube.com/c/BBCArchive?sub_confirmation=1\n\nYou can also dive into plenty more BBC Archive on our website - https://www.bbc.co.uk/archive",
