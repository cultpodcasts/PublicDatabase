Jeremy works with those who have deeply shut-down voices, whose voices often became blocked starting in their childhoods. He understands the significance that parenting, school, and culture can have on our voices, and that, to return a voice to health, we need to address the expression aspects of these issues specifically. \n\n This led Jeremy to develop the Radiant Voices material and methodologies that he teaches now, both as a private vocal transformation coach and in his signature course, Awaken Your Radiant Voice. The focus of Jeremy\u2019s work is to empower clients to go from not trusting their voice to feeling safe and confident about expressing their magic in the world. \n\nFIND JEREMY: \n\nwww.jeremydetolly.com\n\ninstagram.com/jeremydetolly\n\nJanice Selbie\u0027s Best-selling book Divorcing Religion: A Memoir and Survival Handbook is now available in the USA https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DP78TZZF and CANADA https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0DP78TZZF\n\nTickets are now available for the Shameless Sexuality: Life After Purity Culture conference, happening LIVE in Seattle May 23-25, 2025!

His music is a testament to his roots, blending raw, lyrical prowess with harmonious melodies that captivate listeners and transport them to another world. \n\nWith a resume that boasts performances in iconic venues from Los Angeles to New York, Seven J has left his mark on stages worldwide. From the legendary Apollo Theater to the vibrant streets of Jamaica, his electrifying presence has enraptured audiences and earned him acclaim at every turn. \n\nSeven was a deeply trusting child, making him vulnerable to the promises of Christianity. His musical talent and compassion for others set him apart as a believer\u2013 but the racism he experienced INSIDE the Church as an employee was the spark needed to truly examine the faith he\u2019d devoted his entire life to.\n\nWhile Divorcing Christianity has been disorienting for Seven, making music has been a powerful part of his recovery. He holds nothing back on his album, Sunday Mourning, with songs like If Your God is So Good, BulletZ, and I Lost Everything. His latest album \u201CI Am Seven J\u201D has songs like The Truman Show, Never Been There, and 5 Percent.  If, like Seven, you\u2019ve lost your once-cherished faith, he has words of truth you will relate to.\n\nFIND SEVEN J on all streaming platforms. \n\nhttps://sevenjsjm.bandcamp.com/track/sundaymourning\n\nhttps://music.apple.com/us/album/sunday-mourning/1563007215\n\nJanice Selbie\u0027s Best-selling book Divorcing Religion: A Memoir and Survival Handbook is now available in the USA https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DP78TZZF and CANADA https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0DP78TZZF\n\nTickets are now available for the Shameless Sexuality: Life After Purity Culture conference, happening LIVE in Seattle May 23-25, 2025!

His stepfather was so verbally abusive that Willie threatened to kill him. Raised in a strict Christian household deep in the Bible belt, Willie walked away from organized religion and Christianity in 2015.\n\nAfter doing exhaustive research on the topic, he wrote his most recent book: From Saved to Sane: My journey away from Christianity and how it has adversely affected the African American Community. \n\nJanice\u0027s Best-selling book Divorcing Religion: A Memoir and Survival Handbook is now available in\nUSA https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DP78TZZF  and CANADA https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0DP78TZZF\n\nEarly Bird tickets are now available for the Shameless Sexuality: Life After Purity Culture conference, happening LIVE in Seattle May 23-25, 2025!

      "description": "CORT 2023: Claire Alison Hams - Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, my Personal and Professional Perspectives\n\nWithin this session Claire will explore who the people are who knock on your doors, stand idly by magazine carts, and post on social media using hashtag #bestlifeever, the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. \n\nClaire was born to Jehovah\u0027s Witness parents and raised with a view that Armageddon was \u0027just around the corner\u0027. Leaving in her 30s, she has spent the past several years training as a Counsellor, and embarking on understanding the complexities of recovery, as an adult, from high control. Claire has trained with Dr Gillie Jenkinson in her post cult recovery model of therapy and works with ex member of cultic dynamics, supporting them to unravel the layers of indoctrination. Claire also has an active role in the ex-JW support community in the UK. Within this presentation Claire will shed light on this small but powerful high control religious organisation and the devestation it causes to families with its practice of shunning, but also, how building a healthy new life after leaving is possible\n\nClaire Alison Hams\nPsychodynamic and Relational Counsellor\n\nClaire Alison Hams is based in UK and is a psychodynamic and relational counsellor with a first degree in Counselling with the University of Greenwich and an advanced diploma in psychodynamic counselling. She is currently doing doctoral research with the University of Chester exploring second and multi-generation ex-Jehovah\u0027s Witness recovery.\n\nClaire has lived experience of being born in and growing up as a Jehovah\u0027s Witness.  She left as an adult and recognises the unique form of grief that comes with the process of leaving and restarting a life outside religion. Wanting to equip herself with the specific understanding to enable her to work in an informed way with former cult members, Claire trained as a post-cult counsellor with Dr Gillie Jenkinson using a post-cult counselling workbook for recovery and growth. She now works with former members and survivors of cultic groups and relationships including spiritual abuse, religious trauma, various types of undue influence, coercive control and partner abuse. Her website is: https://clairealisonhams.com\n\nA Specialized Approach to Religious Recovery:\nReligious trauma can occur in various settings \u2013 mainstream religion, fringe religious groups and coercive religious cults. Many survivors of religious trauma report that therapists do not understand their issues and may overlook them altogether. In response to this need Gillie Jenkinson conducted research into \u2018what helps\u2019 survivors recover. Her findings, alongside her clinical practice and two internships at Wellspring Retreat and Resource Centre led her to develop an approach she has called \u2018Post-Cult Counselling\u2019 (PCC). PCC has been evidenced to be an effective approach to working with survivors. Gillie has trained two cohorts to deliver PCC on the Certificate in Post-Cult Counselling and Jennifer French and Claire Alison Hams, were two of them. In this talk we will introduce and discuss PCC - a specialised approach to religious recovery \u2013 from our different perspectives including delivering PCC as a Recovery Workshop.\n\nMore about CORT: https://www.religioustraumaconference.org\n\nEarly Bird tickets are now available for the Shameless Sexuality: Life After Purity Culture conference, happening LIVE in Seattle May 23-25, 2025!

When she divorced religion after nearly 4 decades and became a registered professional counsellor, she started to understand her own religious trauma and made it her mission to advocate for others who are recovering from religion. \n\nJanice realized she was attracted to males and females early on, but her religious beliefs and cultural norms didn\u2019t leave room for exploration. As she deconstructed her religious beliefs, her curiosity and desire emerged such that she could enjoy exploring sex and relationship options formerly forbidden. Accordingly, she developed the Divorcing Religion Workshop, founded the Conference on Religious Trauma and the Shameless Sexuality: Life After Purity Culture Conference.\n\nEarly Bird tickets are now available for the Shameless Sexuality: Life After Purity Culture conference, happening LIVE in Seattle May 23-25, 2025!

He tried to avoid this call, but eventually became an Anglican priest, a vocation he lived for 12 years. \n\nAfter being diagnosed with PTSD in 2019 because of his experiences in the church, he spent 2 years on disability for mental health reasons. During that time, he began to question his faith and discovered he could no longer support the idea of a loving god who guided the course of history. Jason regained his freedom of thought, embraced his atheism and relinquished his clerical orders. \n\nJason is now a registered social worker in Ontario. He works in private practice as a therapist, offering virtual sessions throughout Ontario, and in-person session in downtown Ottawa. Jason still describes himself as spiritual, and works mainly with people from across the spectrum of religious and non-religious spiritual expression.\n\nFIND JASON: www.JasonPollick.com\n\nEarly Bird tickets are now available for the Shameless Sexuality: Life After Purity Culture conference, happening LIVE in Seattle May 23-25, 2025!

She later served as an intelligence officer for the US Army for six and a half years, making the rank of Captain, and became one of the first women in US Army history to conduct deliberate ground combat operations when she volunteered to serve on a Female Engagement Team, and received the Presidential Volunteer Service Award. Daniella lives with her husband and daughter in Maryland, and holds a Master\u2019s degree in Industrial and Organizational Psychology from the Harvard Extension School. Daniella is an organizational development speaker with the Macmillan Speaker\u2019s Bureau\n\nIn the vein of Educated and The Glass Castle, Daniella Mestyanek Young\u0027s Uncultured is more than a memoir about an exceptional upbringing, but about a woman who, no matter the lack of tools given to her, is determined to overcome. Uncultured is \u0022a propulsive memoir delivered in the honest tones of a woman who didn\u0027t always think she\u0027d live to tell her story,\u201D (NYT) it\u2019s a book which explores the dangers unleashed when harmful group mentality goes unrecognized, demonstrates the \u201Cdangers of blindly following leaders of any stripe\u201D (Kirkus Review) and is emblematic of the many ways women have to contort themselves to survive.\n\nMore about CORT: https://www.religioustraumaconference.org\n\nEarly Bird tickets are now available for the Shameless Sexuality: Life After Purity Culture conference, happening LIVE in Seattle May 23-25, 2025!

I did this consciously and intentionally while I dismantled every part of the ritual to reclaim my bodily autonomy. It has been one of my most treasured acts of life after religious trauma.\n\nThe journey to be where and who I have become has taken many twists and turns as I have reclaimed my Amish identity and heritage in ways that don\u0027t compromise me.\n\nMary Byler is the Manager and Founder of The Misfit Amish, an organization dedicated to providing secular support and resources to Amish and ex-Amish survivors. As an educator and advocate for Amish children, she collaborates with other organizations and agencies to provide best practice-based resources for Amish/Plain communities and survivors. A medical coder by profession, Byler also holds a Master certificate in life coaching, multiple certifications in trauma awareness, and specializes in working with survivors from cults and conservative sectarian religious groups. She is certified in social and behavioral research by the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative and is a researcher and cultural advisor for the Lock Haven University study on child sexual abuse in conservative Anabaptist communities. Byler was a co-creator of a recent exhibit in Lancaster County on Amish/Plain clothing and sexual assault. She produces audio and video recordings of Amish/Plain survivor stories, with a focus on LGBTQ survivor stories.\n\nMore about CORT: https://www.religioustraumaconference.org\n\nWhen you Support this channel by joining our YouTube membership (starting as low as $3/month) you\u0027ll get early access to all of our new content, access to badges and special chat emojis and more.

      "description": "Religious trauma can occur in various settings \u2013 mainstream religion, fringe religious groups and coercive religious cults. Many survivors of religious trauma report that therapists do not understand their issues and may overlook them altogether. In response to this need Gillie Jenkinson conducted research into \u2018what helps\u2019 survivors recover. Her findings, alongside her clinical practice and two internships at Wellspring Retreat and Resource Centre led her to develop an approach she has called \u2018Post-Cult Counselling\u2019 (PCC). PCC has been evidenced to be an effective approach to working with survivors. Gillie has trained two cohorts to deliver PCC on the Certificate in Post-Cult Counselling and Jennifer French and Claire Alison Hams, were two of them. In this talk we will introduce and discuss PCC - a specialised approach to religious recovery \u2013 from our different perspectives including delivering PCC as a Recovery Workshop.\n\nMore about CORT: https://www.religioustraumaconference.org\n\nWhen you Support this channel by joining our YouTube membership (starting as low as $3/month) you\u0027ll get early access to all of our new content, access to badges and special chat emojis and more.

      "description": "CORT 2023: Dr. Danielle Kramer\nToxic Purity: Unpacking the Patriarchy: Understanding the Foundations of Gender Oppression in Religion and Beyond\n\nHave you ever felt like you were taught conflicting messages about men and women? Men are protectors of women and society\u2026who are visual creatures with uncontrollable lust leaving them unable to stop themselves. Women are the pure, innocent, caring nurturers who need men to guide them\u2026 and also responsible for the fall of man, now capable of being stumbling blocks and potential seductresses. Join Dr. Kramer in this enlightening discussion as we delve deep into the intricate web of gender oppression. Dr. Kramer will navigate the nuanced terrain of ambivalent sexism, dissecting its manifestations in both benevolent and hostile forms, and shed light on how these attitudes perpetuate systemic gender inequalities in religion and society. Moreover, attendees will gain insight into the intricate connection between ambivalent sexism and purity culture within Christianity, illuminating how religious ideologies intersect with patriarchal structures to reinforce gender bias and uphold male hierarchies. Prepare to challenge preconceptions and engage in a thought-provoking discussion on the enduring foundations of gender oppression in our society.\n\nDr. Danielle Kramer (she/they) is a certified sex therapist and board-certified clinical sexologist who splits their time between clinical practice, research, consulting. In clinical practice Dr. Kramer specializes in the care of LGBTQ\u002B folks and women\u2019s/AFAB (assigned female at birth) folks. Dr. Kramer was raised in purity culture and devotes a significant amount of their practice to working with religious and sexual trauma, as well as being the only certified sex therapist in the Florida Panhandle providing gender affirming care. In research Dr. Kramer focuses on misogyny in the US, abortion care and access, and AFAB sexual health. Dr. Kramer also consults on the local, state, and federal level on the politics and policy of abortion care and access. Dr. Kramer is a member of American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors, and Therapists (ASSECT); The American Alternative Sexualities Health Research Alliance (TASHRA); and the Sexual Health Alliance.\n\nMore about CORT: https://www.religioustraumaconference.org\n\nWhen you Support this channel by joining our YouTube membership (starting as low as $3/month) you\u0027ll get early access to all of our new content, access to badges and special chat emojis and more.

      "description": "Shameless Sexuality: David Teachout -The Continuing Religious Trauma of Demands for Purity \n\nDavid Teachout\nMental Health Therapist and Coach, Life Weavings, LLC\n\nIn this talk we\u2019ll discuss human sexuality, its foundation for human relationships, and how to work through the potential trauma that purity culture perpetuates. The most insidious quality of many religious traditions is a belief in the inherent absence of good in people apart from a connection to deity. Often referred to as \u2018sin,\u2019 it is a way of looking at the very nature of our humanity and seeing something rotten, or set apart from what is good and pure. When this is centered on a basic trait like sexuality, a primary way of reflecting on ourselves and how we relate to others becomes cause for shame, malignant self-doubt, and anxiety. \n\nDavid Teachout is a mental health therapist, coach, and photographer focused on teaching how creativity intersects with mental flexibility in working through the inevitable difficulties in life. David grew up as a Christian fundamentalist, attending a bible college and receiving a bachelor\u2019s in theology and psychology. During his studies there, David deconverted and has been on a journey of more deeply appreciating the many nuances of humanity ever since. David has a master\u2019s in both forensic psychology and counseling psychology, and is currently at work on a doctorate in clinical psychology. David has been actively working within the field of psychology as therapist, social worker, advocate, and subject-matter-expert, for over fifteen years. In his spare time, David enjoys reading a copious amount, both fiction and non-fiction, exploring perspective through photography, and maintains a blog at www.lifeweavings.com and a podcast at www.humanitysvalues.com\n\nSupport this channel by becoming a Member of the CORT YouTube channel.\nWhen you Support this channel by joining our YouTube membership (starting as low as $3/month) you\u0027ll get early access to all of our new content, access to badges and special chat emojis, and more.

Relationships of any kind are how we project the meaning we\u2019re creating for our lives and direct the expression of our Values. Like a roadmap and its connection to actual travel, Values need structure to be guided towards realized behavior. For those in a relationship where one or another is religious and the other is non-religious or formerly religious, those structures can lead to misunderstandings, hurt, and unhealthy relationship dynamics.\n\nDavid Teachout is a mental health therapist, coach, and photographer focused on teaching how creativity intersects with mental flexibility in working through the inevitable difficulties in life. David grew up as a Christian fundamentalist, attending a bible college and receiving a bachelor\u2019s in theology and psychology. During his studies there, David deconverted and has been on a journey of more deeply appreciating the many nuances of humanity ever since. David has a master\u2019s in both forensic psychology and counseling psychology, and is currently at work on a doctorate in clinical psychology. David has been actively working within the field of psychology as therapist, social worker, advocate, and subject-matter-expert, for over fifteen years. In his spare time, David enjoys reading a copious amount, both fiction and non-fiction, exploring perspective through photography, and maintains a blog at www.lifeweavings.com and a podcast at www.humanitysvalues.com\n\nMore about CORT: https://www.religioustraumaconference.org\n\nWhen you Support this channel by joining our YouTube membership (starting as low as $3/month) you\u0027ll get early access to all of our new content, access to badges and special chat emojis and more.

I say that\u2019s because you\u2019ve never experienced gay shame. The awakening of sexuality for the heterosexual young person is often a time of exploration and discovery. For the young gay person, awareness of their orientation brings with it fear. Fear of what others will think. Fear of how they will react. Will I be accepted or rejected? Will I go to hell? Within the Christian world, those fears are compounded with shame. You\u2019ve heard nothing positive about being gay or gay people. Perverted, evil, sick, destroyers of all that is good in the world, abominations. And so the secret internal struggle between \u201Cgood\u201D and \u201Cevil\u201D begins, building an identity of self-hatred and self-loathing. Before the truth can set you free you need to understand the lie that kept you enslaved.\n\nAnthony Venn Brown\n\nAmbassadors \u0026 Bridge Builders International is committed to ending the unnecessary suffering caused by ignorance and misinformation about sexual orientation and gender identity.

This\rapproach brings totalist conditioning into the fore of a survivor\u0027s awareness to help them consciously untangle their\rformer belief system from their own personalities and values. It can also offer the survivor a sense of control and\rlimited protection from future manipulation. This talk will look at a manipulation technique known as Sacred Science,\rexamine how this technique is used within a specific Bible-based group (Mormonism), briefly explore its interplay\rwith other manipulation techniques, and offer suggestions on how to overcome its effects.\n\nMore about CORT: https://www.religioustraumaconference.org\n\nSupport the founder of CORT, Janice Selbie on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/janiceselbie\n\nGrab your CORT merch here: \nhttps://www.divorcing-religion.com/conference-on-religious-trauma\n\nIf you are struggling with the symptoms of Religious Trauma Syndrome, sign up for the Divorcing Religion Workshop or one-on-one counseling with Janice Selbie, the founder of CORT: \nhttps://www.divorcing-religion.com\n\nFollow CORT on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ComeToCORT\nFollow CORT on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ConferenceOnReligiousTrauma\nFollow Janice Selbie on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Wise_counsellor\n\nVideo by \nhttps://www.porthosmedia.net",

      "description": "Jessica Barksdale - Family Secrets\n\nCW: CSA, sexual coercion\n\nAuthor JESSICA BARKSDALE has written 16 books, including novels and poetry, with a short story collection coming out this year. She currently teaches a course for UCLA Extension on novel writing. The subject of Jessica\u2019s most recent novel, What the Moon Did, resonates with stories I\u2019ve heard from clients in my counselling practice.\n\nThemes in this book include adolescence, vulnerability, coercion, and family secrets, with the underlying message summarized as: No matter how we try to hide our pasts, the truth finds its way to the surface, sometimes in devastating ways.\n\nMany of us raised in fundamentalist religious families felt the pressure to keep secrets in order to protect reputations. One thing we didn\u2019t know about, though, was the concept of consent.\n\nABOUT JESSICA:\nJessica Barksdale\u2019s sixteenth novel What the Moon Did was published February 2023 by Flexible Press. Her short story collection Trick of the Porch Light is forthcoming in 2023.  She\u2019s published two poetry collections: When We Almost Drowned (2019) and Grim Honey (2021).\nShe taught at Diablo Valley College in Pleasant Hill, California and continues to teach for UCLA Extension and in the online MFA program for Southern New Hampshire University.\n\nWebsite: www.jessicabarksdaleinclan.com\n\nSupport this podcast on Patreon (starting as low as $2/month) and get access to bonus content: https://www.patreon.com/janiceselbie Thanks to my newest patrons: Lois, SatX, Carol, CMM, RL, and KD.

In addition to being deeply fear-based, the cult also endorsed the suppression of joy, freedom, and segregation from wider society.\nIn her own words: \u201CMy opinions and freedom were always in the hands of someone else. This conditioning ran so deep that I couldn\u0027t even gain an understanding of the situation until I escaped and had space.\u201D\n \nLife looks very different for Zorah these days. Viewing herself as an intuitive healer, her passion now is to hold space for people moving through personal transformation.

In this episode, Dr. Shoemaker discusses his transition out of religion and into secular life, from sports to sex to humanism.\n\nSupport this podcast on Patreon and get access to bonus content: https://www.patreon.com/janiceselbie\n\nGet your tickets to the Conference on Religious Trauma 2023 https://www.religioustraumaconference.org/\n\nSubscribe to the audio-only version here: https://www.divorcing-religion.com/religious-trauma-podcast\n\nGet your free consultation with Janice, book 1:1 sessions, or sign up for the Divorcing Religion Workshop here: https://www.divorcing-religion.com/\n\nGet your recordings from the Shameless Sexuality: Life After Purity Culture conference here: https://www.religioustraumaconference.org/register\n\nFollow Janice and the Conference on Religious Trauma on Social Media: \n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/divorcereligion\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Wise_counsellor\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ComeToCORT\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/janice.selbie\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DivorcingReligion\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ConferenceOnReligiousTrauma\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@janiceselbie\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/wisecounsellor/\n\nThe Divorcing Religion Podcast is for entertainment purposes only.

If we\u2019re lucky, we grow up in an environment where the adults around us encourage and foster that creativity.\n\nHowever, for many people who have experienced high-demand religions, their creativity was diminished or outright discouraged. \n\nReclaiming our creativity is a way to express what we experienced, sometimes before we have the linguistic faculties to speak about it, because many of us understand our experiences on a sensory level that supersedes language.\n\nBy using art to tell our stories we begin to take control of them, rewriting the narratives that our abusers had manipulated for so long.\n\nIn this session participants will learn several art exercises that they can use to deepen their own artistic practices, and the science behind how and why they work.\n\nMore about CORT: https://www.religioustraumaconference.org\n\nSupport the founder of CORT, Janice Selbie on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/janiceselbie\n\nFrom the creators of the Conference on Religious Trauma comes the Shameless Sexuality Conference: a conference dedicated to life after purity culture. \n\nGet your tickets to the upcoming Shameless Sexuality: https://www.shamelesssexuality.org/\n\nGrab your CORT merch here: \nhttps://www.divorcing-religion.com/conference-on-religious-trauma\n\nIf you are struggling with the symptoms of Religious Trauma Syndrome, sign up for the Divorcing Religion Workshop or one-on-one counseling with Janice Selbie, the founder of CORT: \nhttps://www.divorcing-religion.com\n\nFollow CORT on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ComeToCORT\nFollow CORT on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ConferenceOnReligiousTrauma\nFollow Janice Selbie on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Wise_counsellor\n\nMusic: \nhttps://www.bensound.com\n\nVideo by \nhttps://www.porthosmedia.net",

      "title": "CORT 2021: Dave Warnock - Dying Out Loud",
      "description": "I\u2019m Dave Warnock, a former conservative Evangelical pastor and church leader for almost 40 years. About ten years ago, I began a process of examining and investigating the faith claims of Evangelical Christianity- for the first time in my life...and came to the conclusion that the faith I had given my life to was something I could no longer embrace. At first calling myself an agnostic, in the last few years I have purposefully begun to embrace the word \u2018Atheist\u2019. In so doing, I\u2019m doing what I can to de-stigmatize this word (which simply means \u201Cnon-theist\u201D) and seeking to show that atheists can be good people- exhibiting the same morals and values as people of faith.\n\nMy exit from Christianity was basically due to the tenants of my life-long faith no longer aligning with my core beliefs of toleration and acceptance of all people, and my belief that life is to be lived for the moments that are contained within this one life we know we have; rather than viewing this life as a \u201Ctemporary\u201D life until we enter eternity. Turning my back on this faith came at huge personal cost- with the loss of almost my entire community of friends, the end of my 37 year marriage, and the loss of relationship with two of my three children, which has also deprived me of being a part of my six grandchildren\u2019s lives to this day.\n\nAs we know, life is random, chaotic, and unpredictable; and it\u2019s no different for me. On February 26, 2019, I received the devastating diagnosis of ALS (Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease). A series of doctor visits, a blood test, MRI, more doctor visits, and finally an EMG at one of the most prestigious hospitals in the country was followed by the cold and clinically fatal diagnosis - along with instructions to put my clothes back on and where to find the elevator outside the exit from the neurologist\u2019s office. No follow-up plan\u2026no counselor referral\u2026just to go home and die in 3-5 years.\n\nSuddenly for me this precious and brief life became infinitely more precious and incredibly brief. Instead of succumbing to the depression, anger, and hopelessness this debilitating fatal diagnosis often brings, I immediately decided to begin \u201CDying Out Loud,\u201D - living life to the fullest and making plans to travel as much of the world as my body will allow. I wanted to see places to which I\u2019d never been and spend time with people I know and love, while also experiencing the joy of meeting new people and cherishing the beautiful \u201Cmoments\u201D life offers all of us. This life-change soon morphed into what is now known as the Dying Out Loud tour; wherein I am traveling to speak at venues all over the country (actually, the world), doing interviews on podcasts and YouTube shows, and basically spreading my message anywhere I can.\n\nFollow my adventure on social media as I seek to grab as many moments as I can. You can send a message on social media to schedule time with me if I\u0027ll be in your area. Or if you would like for me to come speak to your group about my life with and without Christianity, \u0022Dying Out Loud\u0022, facing death as an atheist, and on Dying with Dignity, (among other topics) please reach out to us to schedule something.
