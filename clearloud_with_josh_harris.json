      "title": "Escaping Cult Thinking, Finding Real Connection (with Ben Crawford)",
      "description": "Content note: This episode includes frank discussion of sex, pornography, and religious control. Author Ben Crawford spent decades inside a tight church network where life, money, and meaning were all centralized. When he started sharing his life on YouTube and telling the truth in 12-step rooms, the system pushed back. He lost community, business ties, and friends. He also found something bigger: a voice, a marriage that\u2019s alive, and a way of connecting that doesn\u2019t hide behind ideas. This is a conversation about escaping control, learning vulnerability, and why honesty beats \u201Caccountability\u201D every time. Topics we cover Preaching vs sharing: why ideas felt safe and intimacy didn\u2019t The men\u2019s \u201Caccountability\u201D script and why it blocks connection What 12-step groups modeled: clear truth, no fixing, real safety The \u201Ccult continuum\u201D and how control shows up in everyday church life Grading communities by behavior, not labels Choosing where to be authentic and where to hold boundaries Ben\u2019s love story with Cami and the surprising payoff of telling the truth Why listen If you\u2019ve felt the gap between what your community promised and what it delivered, or if you\u2019ve tried to change people with ideas and missed the chance to actually bond, this episode gives language and practices for a different way forward. About Ben Ben Crawford is the author of the bestselling 2000 Miles Together: The Story of the Largest Family to Hike the Appalachian Trail and has been featured on Good Morning America and NPR\u2019s This American Life. Formerly entrenched in fundamentalist religion and once at the helm of one of the world\u2019s largest blackjack teams (profiled in the documentary Holy Rollers: The True Story of Card Counting Christians), Ben brings a singular perspective to faith, risk, and reinvention. Retired in his 30s, he\u2019s a prolific YouTuber with 1,000\u0026#43; uploads, and he now finds joy in poker and marathon running\u2014with his six kids often along for the mile markers.

      "description": "Did evangelicalism fail a generation? How do disillusioned Christians process their experiences in churches and hold on to their faith? How do families divided over Trump find common ground?\u00A0\n\n\n\nIn this revealing episode, I sit down with Jon Ward, journalist, author, and chief national correspondent at Yahoo! News, to discuss his latest book, Testimony: Inside the Evangelical Movement that Failed a Generation.\n\n\n\nJon Ward describes his life as being divided in half: two decades inside the evangelical Christian bubble and two decades outside of it.\n\n\n\nIn Testimony, Ward tells the story of his upbringing in, and eventual break from, an influential evangelical church in the 1980s and 1990s (more about that particular church below). Ward sheds light on the evangelical movement\u0027s troubling political and cultural dimensions, tracing the ways in which he believes the Jesus People movement was seduced by materialism and other factors to become politically captive rather than prophetic.\n\n\n\nFull disclosure: the church Jon grew up in and which he strongly critiques in his book is the same that I joined at age 22 and went on to pastor for ten years. For me, this is a very personal conversation. Our discussion offers listeners a front-row seat to the intersection of faith, politics, and the challenges of reckoning with one\u0027s past.\u00A0\n\n\n\nInterview Highlights:\u00A0\n\n\n     \n      \n  \u2022  \n     \n     Jon\u0027s perspective on influential figures like CJ Mahaney and Al Mohler and their roles within the evangelical movement.\n     \n     \n     \n      \n  \u2022  \n     \n     The ramifications of political trends and the Trump presidency, on personal relationships and faith.\n     \n     \n     \n       \n  \u2022  \n     \n     Whether it\u2019s possible to be open to being wrong and still hold to absolute truth\u00A0\n     \n     \n     \n       \n  \u2022  \n     \n     Comparing the roles of church leaders and the media in accountability and the parallels Jon sees between them.\n     \n     \n     \n       \n  \u2022  \n     \n     Jon\u0027s vision for the future of modern American Christianity and the steps he believes are crucial for its transformation.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n\n\nWhether you\u0027re entrenched in the evangelical community, just curious, or somewhere in between, this episode promises a candid exploration of faith, growth, and the complexities of human experience.\n\n\n\n\nLearn More: \n\n\n\nWebsite: Jonwardwrites.org (http://jonwardwrites.org/) \n\n\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jonwardwrites/\n\n\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jonward11",
