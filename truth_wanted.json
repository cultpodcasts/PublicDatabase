Truth Wanted would like to know how you know it\u2019s true. Hosted by ObjectivelyDan, Truth Wanted takes calls from the community (that means YOU!) and features new guests every week, emphasizing thorough conversations over name-calling and scoffing (most of the time). Truth Wanted focuses on how and why people believe what they believe, and how you can talk about beliefs in more effective ways. Join us for truth investigations and lively conversations every Friday at 7:00pm CT! \n\nThe Atheist Community of Austin is organized as a nonprofit educational corporation to develop and support the atheist community, to provide opportunities for socializing and friendship, to promote secular viewpoints, to encourage positive atheist culture, to defend the first amendment principle of state-church separation, to oppose discrimination against atheists and to work with other organizations in pursuit of common goals.\n\nWe define atheism as the lack of belief in gods. This definition also encompasses what most people call agnosticism.\n\n\u25BA http://www.atheist-community.org (The Atheist Community of Austin)\n\u25BA Check out Dan\u0027s other channel @ https://www.youtube.com/objectivelydan\n\nNOTES\n\nTruthWanted is the official channel of Truth Wanted. \u0022Truth Wanted\u0022 is a trademark of the ACA.\n\nThumbnail artwork by: https://www.instagram.com/princepsed \n\nIntro Music:\nCold Funk - Funkorama by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100499\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/\n\nCopyright \u00A9 2018 Atheist Community of Austin.
