      "description": "Episode 188:\u00A0In early October of 1994, during a bizarre, nearly simultaneous sequence of murder / suicides, in Quebec, and across the Atlantic in Switzerland, 53 members of the Order of the Solar Temple were found dead in burned out buildings. The deaths fulfilled what the cult\u2019s leaders claimed was the group\u2019s \u201Cfinal transit\u201D or return to Unity with God required before the impending end of the world. Even though it appeared to be over, more cult members were yet to die. Over a year later, in December of 1995, sixteen members of the cult died in France. More than a year after that, in march 1997, another five cult members died in Quebec bringing the death toll to 74.\u00A0\n\n\n\nThe cult\u2019s two founders, Luc Jouret and Joseph Di Mambro, were among the dead in 1994, however, some fear there may be future related mass murder / suicides by followers still practicing in secret.\n\nSources:\n\n\n\n\nCult Education Institute :: The Order of the Solar Temple (https://culteducation.com/group/1158-solar-temple/) \n\n\n\nOrder of the Solar Temple - Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Solar_Temple) \n\n\n\n12 Disturbing Secrets Of The Order Of The Solar Temple Cult (https://www.ranker.com/list/order-of-the-solar-temple-cult/amandasedlakhevener) \n\n\n\nThe Cult of the Sun and the Cult of the Dead in Egypt on JSTOR (https://www.jstor.org/stable/3854140?read-now=1\u0026refreqid=excelsior%3Ae7be9b0c8f764633c62b1fdee8f1f920\u0026seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) \n\n\n\nRead Doomsday Cults: The Devil\u2019s Hostages Online by Alan R.

      "description": "Episode 081 - in the late 1920 and early 1930\u0027s a group called the Aquarian Foundation, led by a self-professed spiritual guru who called himself Brother XII set up just south\u00A0 of Nanaimo B.C. Brother XII drew wealthy followers to his cult with his promises of salvation through a coming apocalypse. As we\u0027ve seen many times since the lust for power, sex and money corrupted the group, who, after scandals and cruel treatment turned on Brother XII.\n\n\n\nHe and a female follower, he claimed to be his wife, absconded with some of the treasure that the group had amassed. However, many believe there are still millions of dollars worth of Brother XII\u0027s gold hidden somewhere in the area.\n\n\n\nPhoto from the collection of Melody Wilson-Claridge\n\nSources:\nWikipedia - Brother XII (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brother_XII)  and De Courcy Island (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Courcy_Island) \nThe Brother XII Affair (https://viurrspace.ca/handle/10613/232) \nBooks by Brother XII on Amazon (https://www.amazon.ca/s?i=digital-text\u0026rh=p_27%3ABrother\u002BXII\u0026s=relevancerank\u0026text=Brother\u002BXII\u0026ref=dp_byline_sr_ebooks_1) \nBrotherXII.com (https://www.brotherxii.com/) \u00A0 and the book Brother XII by John Oliphant (https://www.amazon.ca/Brother-XII-Strange-Odyssey-20th-Century/dp/0978097203/) \nCBC - The Dream of Brother XII (https://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/the-dream-of-brother-xii-1.3500955) \nGlobal - Brother XII\u0027s Gold (https://globalnews.ca/news/5264892/brother-xii-gold/) \nAtlas Obscura entry about Brother XII (https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/what-happened-to-this-cult-leaders-lost-treasure) \nTheosophy.org - About Theosophy (https://www.theosophical.org/about/theosophy) \nBook - Canadian Mysteries of the Unexplained (https://amzn.to/2UPfSKV) \nDocumentary - The Canadians: Brother Twelve (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5MG6xUQlCQ) \n\n\nSupport the show: https://www.patreon.com/darkpoutine\n\n\n \n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

She was known to police as a member of the Ant Hill Gang, a religious cult, run by the charismatic and enigmatic Roch Theriault, who\u0027d changed his name to Moses. As the woman\u0027s story came out, so did other tales of violence, sexual abuse, torture and murder at the hands of Roch and others in the group who were doing his bidding.\n\n\n\nNote: There are extremely graphic depictions of violence in this episode that may be disturbing to some listeners.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer by: Tyler Allen of The Minds of Madness Podcast (https://mindsofmadnesspodcast.com/) \n\nSources:\nSavage Messiah by Paul Kaihla and Ross Laver (https://amzn.to/2Dg6PYS) \nRoch Theriault wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roch_Th%C3%A9riault) \nMacleans Magazine - The Ant Hill Kids (1993) (https://archive.macleans.ca/article/1993/2/8/the-ant-hill-kids) \ncvltnation.com (https://www.cvltnation.com/ant-hill-kids-break-legs-sledgehammer-go-hell/) \nCults That Kill by Wendy Joan Biddlecombe Agasr (https://amzn.to/2IfFF8o) \nInfoSect - Examples of Problematic Group Functioning (https://infosect.freeshell.org/infocult/phenomene/English/HTML/doc0007.htm) \nCult Leader Roch Th\u00E9riault aka The Deadly Messiah (Crime Documentary) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euShLQuG8xc) \nNew York Daily News (https://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/canadian-messiah-formed-doomsday-cult-ulcer-problems-article-1.3797931) \nGlobal News: Notorious Cult Leader Found Dead in Prison (https://globalnews.ca/news/110230/notorious-cult-leader-found-dead-in-prison/) \n\n\nSupport the show: https://www.patreon.com/darkpoutine\n\n\n \n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
