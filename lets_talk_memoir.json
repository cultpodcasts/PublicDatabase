      "title": "184. Writing About Childhood Sexual Abuse without Reliving It featuring Dr. Stacey Hettes",
      "description": "Dr. Stacey Hettes joins Let\u2019s Talk Memoir for a conversation about therapeutic writing and how she crafted a memoir about childhood sexual abuse without revictimizing herself, metabolizing childhood trauma, inviting readers into our physiological response, the role of our limbic systems, deciding whether to share specifics about abuse in our manuscripts, italicizing difficult material for readers so they can decide, approaching a story of child sexual abuse in a protective way, putting therapy into our memoirs, demonstrating our character\u2019s progress in our narrative, remembering we can write beautifully about hard things, and her new memoir Dispatches from the Couch. Also in this episode: -sharing a memoir with family -the amygdala and child trauma victims -deciding whether to share specifics about abuse Books mentioned in this episode: -Bodywork by Melissa Febos -Wintering by Catherine May -Writing a Woman\u2019s Life by Caroline G. Heilbrun -Learning to Walk in the Dark by Barbara Brown Taylor Professor Stacey Hettes teaches biology and neuroscience to undergraduates eager to enter the worlds of science and medicine at Wofford College in Spartanburg, SC. She holds a PhD from the University of California, Riverside, and is the youngest winner to date of the Milliken Award for Excellence in the Teaching of Science. Her classes are difficult because life is difficult. They are also full of wonder, joy, and triumph because, like her students, she is a hard-working seeker. She relishes in shared struggle and shared discovery, even when the topic is long-buried child sexual abuse. Reemerging from the shadows of her past was only possible once she resolved to carry the story found in her Debut memoir, Dispatches from the Couch, into the light.

Her memoir is her first book and an important element in her quest to make the world a safer place for children. She lives in Cape Town, South Africa, with her two cats.\n\nAbout her memoir Mission of Malice:\n\nWhen Erika Bornman was nine years old, her family joined, and ultimately moved to, KwaSizabantu, a Christian mission in South Africa \u2013 a place touted as a nirvana, founded on egalitarian values. But something sinister lurks below the veneer of piousness here.\n\nLife at KwaSizabantu is hard. Christianity is used to justify harsh punishments and congregants are forced to repent for their sins. Threats of physical violence ensure adherence to stringent rules. Parents are pitted against children. Friendships are discouraged. Isolated and alone, Erika lives in constant fear of eternal damnation.\n\nAt 17, her grooming at the hands of a senior mission counsellor begins. For the next five years, KwaSizabantu wages emotional, psychological and sexual warfare on her, until, finally, she manages to break free and walk away at the age of 21.\n\nEscaping a restrictive religious community is difficult, but rehabilitation into \u2018normal\u2019 life after a decade of ritual humiliation, brainwashing and abuse is much more painful, as Erika soon discovers. She cannot ignore her knowledge of the grievous human-rights abuses being committed at KwaSizabantu, and so she embarks on a quest to expose the atrocities. With her help, News24 launches a seven-month investigation, culminating in a podcast that will go on to win the internationally renowned One World Media Award for Radio and Podcast in 2021.\n\nIn Mission of Malice: My Exodus from KwaSizabantu, Erika chronicles her journey from a fearful young girl to a fierce activist determined to do whatever it takes to save future generations and find personal redemption and self-acceptance.\n\n\u00A0\n\nConnect with Erika:\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Ebee40\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/erikabornman/\n\nWebsite: www.erikabornman.com\n\nGet Erika\u2019s book: https://www.amazon.com/Mission-Malice-My-exodus-KwaSizabantu-ebook/dp/B09B45VMP6\n\n\u00A0\n\n--\n\nRonit Plank is a writer, teacher, and editor whose work has been featured in The Atlantic, The Washington Post, The New York Times, Writer\u2019s Digest, The Rumpus, American Literary Review, Hippocampus, The Iowa Review, and elsewhere.
