Her memoir is her first book and an important element in her quest to make the world a safer place for children. She lives in Cape Town, South Africa, with her two cats.\n\nAbout her memoir Mission of Malice:\n\nWhen Erika Bornman was nine years old, her family joined, and ultimately moved to, KwaSizabantu, a Christian mission in South Africa \u2013 a place touted as a nirvana, founded on egalitarian values. But something sinister lurks below the veneer of piousness here.\n\nLife at KwaSizabantu is hard. Christianity is used to justify harsh punishments and congregants are forced to repent for their sins. Threats of physical violence ensure adherence to stringent rules. Parents are pitted against children. Friendships are discouraged. Isolated and alone, Erika lives in constant fear of eternal damnation.\n\nAt 17, her grooming at the hands of a senior mission counsellor begins. For the next five years, KwaSizabantu wages emotional, psychological and sexual warfare on her, until, finally, she manages to break free and walk away at the age of 21.\n\nEscaping a restrictive religious community is difficult, but rehabilitation into \u2018normal\u2019 life after a decade of ritual humiliation, brainwashing and abuse is much more painful, as Erika soon discovers. She cannot ignore her knowledge of the grievous human-rights abuses being committed at KwaSizabantu, and so she embarks on a quest to expose the atrocities. With her help, News24 launches a seven-month investigation, culminating in a podcast that will go on to win the internationally renowned One World Media Award for Radio and Podcast in 2021.\n\nIn Mission of Malice: My Exodus from KwaSizabantu, Erika chronicles her journey from a fearful young girl to a fierce activist determined to do whatever it takes to save future generations and find personal redemption and self-acceptance.\n\n\u00A0\n\nConnect with Erika:\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Ebee40\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/erikabornman/\n\nWebsite: www.erikabornman.com\n\nGet Erika\u2019s book: https://www.amazon.com/Mission-Malice-My-exodus-KwaSizabantu-ebook/dp/B09B45VMP6\n\n\u00A0\n\n--\n\nRonit Plank is a writer, teacher, and editor whose work has been featured in The Atlantic, The Washington Post, The New York Times, Writer\u2019s Digest, The Rumpus, American Literary Review, Hippocampus, The Iowa Review, and elsewhere.
