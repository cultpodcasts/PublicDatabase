      "description": "I shared a bit of info on my more personal-life-focused Instagram, but figured it was time to talk about it in full! With the end of 2024 coming up, I\u0027m ready to firmly close this chapter of my life. But, a final piece to the closure puzzle is actually talking about it and in some way holding my abuser accountable.  \n  \nAlso, hello hi, my name is Rhys, my pronouns are they/them, and I usually focus on cosplay!  \nYou can find me at Cthulhu_Cos on Instagram for cosplay stuff, or ThiccccMothman for more personal things.",
