Exploring the influence of a renowned minister from the 1950s and \u002760s on Trump\u0027s tactics will shed light on this worrisome trend. Additionally, marking 103 years since the Tulsa Race Massacre, two centenarian survivors persist in their quest for justice, coinciding with a pivotal court hearing today, highlighting the enduring struggle for accountability and reconciliation. All this and more in this edition of The ReidOut on MSNBC.",
