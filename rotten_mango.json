They are one of the rare business success stories raking in millions of dollars. \n\nUntil you dig deeper. \n\nThe name Synarra means- New Nation.\n\nThe record company was founded by a woman who wanted to create a new nation for her followers. \n\nA woman who allegedly forced young healthy men to line up outside her door to wait for their golden chance to be SA\u2019d by her. \n\nA woman who was tried for the torture and murder of a 5 year old baby. \n\nThis is the story of the Baby Garden cult - and how they made millions in the K-Pop industry without anyone knowing\u2026\n\nThey\u2019re still around to this day. \n\nFull Source Notes: rottenmangopodcast.com\n\nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "The Department of Justice makes a very public statement\u2014it feels more like a threat. \u201CPlease do not reproduce, share, or use this exhibit in any way. If you have downloaded this file, please delete it off your device.\u201D The DOJ had accidentally leaked a file they previously moved to seal from the public. Not one thing, nor one name was redacted. The file in question - is the client list to one of the most high profile sex workers in all of Manhattan. Her revenue in just a few years was in the millions of dollars - her hourly rate was $1500. It\u2019s safe to assume that this leaked, \u2019sealed\u2019 file includes the names of NYC\u2019s upper elite. High peorfile businessmen, millionaire-married couples, artists, restaurant tycoons, and lots and lots of rich married men. Some of the names were recognized to be high level executives at Apple, other major retailers, one wealthy hedge fund manager, one international diamond dealer, and a former NY Supreme Court Judge. But they hadn\u2019t just been listed as clients for sex work. They had all been named as alleged clients of a sex trafficking business run by a college cult. 10 years prior, a man had walked onto an elite private school campus to visit his daughter, a sophomore at the university. The man, her father, ends up staying on campus, living in his daughter\u2019s dorm, and quickly begins the process of grooming and brainwashing all of his daughter\u2019s friends. The result was a decade long cult. Some of the friends turned cult members were \u2018promoted\u2019 to chauffeur or solder. Others into forced labor. His daughter\u2019s friends would become his wives.\u2019 And that left one, forced to turn to sex work. They all served one old, middle aged man. This is the case of Lawrence Ray and his decade long cult of college students and sex.

Talia was a good friend, she always talked about wanting to become a lawyer and help people. She just had this tiny little quirk\u2026 She was obsessed with her dad. Even at parties - she would not stop talking about what an incredible man he was. He\u2019s just going to stay in their dorms while he looks for a new place. What could possibly go wrong? When Larry Ray moves into Talia\u2019s dorm - he slowly starts brainwashing all of Talia\u2019s friends. Soon, he will be sleeping in Talia\u2019s best friend\u2019s room. Encouraging the students to all have intimate relations with each other\u2026 while he watches. This would be the start of his decade-long college cult.

His male followers\u2019 private parts were cut off, teeth were pulled out with pliers, and they were creatively beaten on a daily basis.\n\nHe performed open stomach surgery on one of his wives without painkillers or anesthetic.
