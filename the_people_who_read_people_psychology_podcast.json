      "description": "My third episode about Chase Hughes, who promotes himself as the \u201C#1 expert in behavior and influence\u201D and who\u0027s known for being on The Behavior Panel show. My first episode about Chase examined his early deceptions and his involvement in pick-up artistry and vitamin supplement sales (that episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t1DMxmqJOk). In this episode, I focus on how Chase\u0027s content and training relates to Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), and related things like hypnosis/influence courses and transformational seminars. Time-stamped chapters are below.\n\nSummary of points in this episode: Chase has used the NLP trainer template but repackaged it with a military/secret-agent/MK-Ultra-type spin. I examine the connections between NLP and Chase\u2019s behavior analysis and influence/hypnosis content. I also attempt to explain why Chase (and people like him) can acquire good reviews and fans, despite so much of it being low-quality and also very expensive. I examine Chase\u2019s promotion of supplements sold by a chiropractor named John Lieurance. And I talk about the various people who\u0027ve promoted Chase, from influential podcasters to Dr. Phil to his fellow Behavior Panel members, and why there\u0027s such a lack of interest in examining Chase\u0027s deceptive claims.\n\nFor a transcript and more details about this episode, see https://behavior-podcast.com/chase-hughes-and-how-he-put-a-military-top-secret-spin-on-nlp-hypnosis-seminar-ideas. \n\nA later episode will focus on behavior analysis and the Behavior Panel.
