      "description": "Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses preach about their beliefs and attempt to make converts. Why is this?\n\n\nThey call it the preaching \u2018work\u2019. It\u0027s not work. It\u2019s ritualistic and embodied subjugation to the dogma. It\u2019s how you act out your submission to the beliefs in a ritualistic way. It\u2019s self flagellation. It\u2019s self indoctrination. It\u0027s a defense mechanism against the absurdity of the beliefs themselves. It\u2019s a performance of reputation management and an act of community self-monitoring. It is a savage consumer of a person\u0027s mental and emotional energy and of their precious time.\n\n(Matthew 24:14) .\u202F.\u202F.And this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.\u202F.\u202F.\n(Matthew 28:19, 20) .\u202F.\u202F.Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, \u202Fteaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you. And, look! I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.\u201D\n\n\nYou dress up, listen to some half baked pep-talk and go knocking on doors that you don\u0027t want to knock on to preach at people who don\u0027t want to be preached to. So this is a ritual, to remind yourself and others of what a good submissive boy you are.\n\nYou do it because you want other Witnesses to see you are doing it and to live up to the expectations of what some old men have decided constitutes service to God. \n\n\nWhether the group is a \u201Cfraternity or tenured faculty,\u201D the more difficult, \u201Cpainful and humiliating\u201D the initiation process, the higher value members will place on the group. The mere act of devoting time and effort \u201Cchanges the way we evaluate it.\u201D\nAreily, D. 2010. The Upside of Irrationality. The Unexpected Benefits of Defying Logic at Home and at Work. pp.89, 103\n\nIt is self indoctrination. \nYou are there to give them the truth. You have this important information and you are intensely focused on that mindset for the time you are in that work. You are also expressing publicly and repeatedly that you believe this and that you have good reasons for it. You are reinforcing the indoctrination of yourself. \n\nSteve Hassan. Combating Cult Mind Control.\nP.118 Cult \u201Cmembers are also kept so busy that they don\u2019t have time to think and seek outside answers to questions. When they do read, it is primarily cult-generated propaganda or material that has been censored to keep members focused.\u201D\n\nIt reminds the JW\u2019s that they are different from the world. Reminds them that the only place they will find validation and acceptance is in the org. Yet perversely, this is only because the org has artificially created these conditions.\n\n\u201CSocial strength, or maintenance of community, is attained by creating strong ties within the congregation, primarily due to emphasizing the difference with the larger community.\u201D Djupe, P. A. 2000. Religious Brand Loyalty and Political Loyalties. p.80\n\nThis preaching is also a natural reaction to the dogma\u0027s manifest falsity.\n\n\u201CThe proselytizing fanatic strengthens his own faith by converting others. The creed whose legitimacy is most easily challenged is likely to develop the strongest proselytizing impulse.\u201D True believer p.110 \n\n\u201CIf more and more people can be persuaded that a system of belief is correct, then clearly it must, after all, be correct.\u201D p. 30 Festinger\n\nHere\u0027s another perverse thing about it. When people reject the message it\u0027s proof of their dogma. When people accept it it is proof of their ideology. \n\nThis is the desperate mess that JWs find themselves in. \n\nIt has multiple layers or artificiality stacked up on itself and that is why it\u2019s so hated  by so many Witnesses. It\u2019s superficial, it\u2019s demeaning. \n\nEven though they might not like doing it, It makes Witnesses believe that they are having a part to play in the grand cosmic drama at the center of JW beliefs. The end is coming, people are going to die, but we warned them, and saved some too. \n\nWhether the Governing Body knows it or not, they are following the cult playbook very well. Keep people very busy in their cult activities, and praise those people who are very active loyal cult members and scold those that dare to have personal goals or ambitions that don\u2019t center on advancing in the cult.\n\nCan you imagine the respect the JWs would have if they spent this time doing something constructive. Imagine 1 billion hours a year being given to helping the hom;less, picking up trash on the streets, community visits for the elderly. There\u2019s  a thousand things they could do if they really wanted to help people.\n\nYou\u2019ll hear JW call it a volunteer work as if this imbues it some kind of nobility. \n\nSo we can safely say that, even though this is something JWs are famous for, and something for which the JWs think they have good reasons for; they in fact don\u2019t know why they preach, because if they knew the real reasons they\u2019d never do it again.",
