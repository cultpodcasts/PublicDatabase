      "title": "Why is Mica Miller\u0027s Church Hiding This Sermon? | Part 3 | #justiceformica",
      "description": "This is part 3 of an exclusive review of the sermon hidden from the world. Solid Rock Church at Market Common Church in Myrtle Beach, SC deleted this sermon shortly after the news of Mica Miller\u0027s death went nationwide. I believe they did that to hide Pastor JP Miller\u0027s body language and behavior in this sermon and to hide from further scrutiny.\n\nThanks to a whistleblower, however, we have the full deleted sermon. Please join me as I walk through the sermon JP Miller preached the morning he announced his estranged wife\u0027s death. We\u0027ll look specifically for red flags of deception, manipulation, and other behavior that might shed some light on the tragic death of Mica Miller. \n\nWatch Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1rLwAbnPME \nWatch Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggM_rGqKYE\n\nChurch Historian Russell Kelly Re: Hebrews 7 and Tithing: https://www.tithing-russkelly.com/hebrews-7-extremely-important/ \n\nShawn McCraney\u0027s Expository Teachings in Hebrews - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfgIkHYF1Kg\u0026list=PLC32FE4B28369B466\u0026index=1\n\nThe Truth About Tithing - https://www.checkmychurch.org/post/what-is-tithing-the-truth-about-tithing \n\n#justiceformica #micamiller #jpmiller #solidrockchurch #christiancults #churchabuse #churchtoo #christianchurches #sermonreview #redflags #deceptiondetection",
