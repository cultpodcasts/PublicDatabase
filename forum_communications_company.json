      "description": "How a \u0027cult\u0027 took hold in the small town of Neche, North Dakota \u00A0 In the summer of 2024, reporters C.S. Hagen and Drew Trafton presented a reporting series and two-part documentary highlighting the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, a Christian sect that began in the U.K. in the 1800s and has since branched out globally. The PBCC also has historic ties to the small town of Neche, North Dakota. \u00A0 Former members report that the church is responsible for a wide range of misconduct, from money laundering schemes to complicity with sexual assault.\u00A0 \u00A0 For this first in a three-part audio series, C.S. and Drew sit down with Trisha Taurinskas to discuss their reporting and give listeners a glimpse inside the church, what it believes and the accusations of its former members.",
