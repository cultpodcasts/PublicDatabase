      "description": "When belief loosens, the body doesn\u2019t instantly feel safe \u2014 it finally responds.\n\nThis video explains why fear, confusion, or physical reactions can surface after belief has already shifted.  As one of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, many of us learned to override instinct, doubt our perceptions, and stay aligned in order to feel safe. When that structure loosens, the nervous system doesn\u2019t collapse \u2014 it reveals what it was carrying.\n\nThis is not about doctrine being exposed.\n\nIt\u2019s about understanding the human impact, the bodily cost, and why these reactions make sense.\n\nIf you\u2019ve experienced symptoms you couldn\u2019t explain \u2014 or you\u2019re trying to understand what leaving a high-control belief system does to a person \u2014 this video is meant to give language to that experience.\n\nIf you would like to see more about the internal workings, history and changing doctrines as well as lived experience please make sure to subscribe.\n\nstock footage and image sources\nWatchtower Bible and Tract Society\nPexels\nGoogle images",

      "description": "Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are judged by a rulebook most members are never allowed to see.\n\nIn this video we examine Shepherd the Flock of God\u2014the elders\u2019 manual that governs discipline, repentance, apostasy, and family separation\u2014using the organization\u2019s own publications and procedures.\n\nMost Witnesses are taught that decisions about disfellowshipping, repentance, and spiritual standing come directly from the Bible. But the reality is more complex. This manual outlines internal rules, definitions, and judicial processes that ordinary members are never shown, even though they are held accountable to them\u2014often for life-altering consequences.\n\nIn this video, we look at:\nhow discipline is defined and enforced\nwhy baptism binds members to unseen rules\nhow apostasy is classified\nwhere mental health and sexuality are addressed\nand how internal policy can outweigh scripture in practice\n\nThis is not an attack on individual believers. It\u2019s an examination of systems, authority, and transparency\u2014using Watchtower\u2019s own material.\n\nIf you were one of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, or are questioning now, you\u2019re not alone.\n\nTake your time.

      "description": "The pressure Jehovah\u2019s Witness families face in hospitals is far greater than most people realize \u2014 and recently, my husband and I experienced it firsthand.\n\nJehovah\u2019s Witness Hospital Liaison Committees (HLCs) are supposed to \u201Csupport\u201D members with medical decisions\u2026 but what actually happens behind the scenes often feels very different. In this video, I walk you through what we just went through during my husband\u2019s surgery prep, how quickly the \u201Cbloodless\u201D expectations kicked in, and the kind of emotional, spiritual, and social pressure that comes with it.\n\nAs a former JW raised to believe bloodless care was the only faithful option, I know exactly how the fear, guilt, and organizational loyalty shape a person\u2019s choices \u2014 especially when their health or their life is on the line. Today, I\u2019m sharing both the research and the lived reality.\n\nIn this video, we\u2019ll cover:\n\u2022 How JW Hospital Liaisons approach families\n\u2022 The subtle and not-so-subtle pressure to agree to \u201Cbloodless\u201D care\n\u2022 Why many Witnesses feel they have no real choice\n\u2022 How high-control groups influence medical decision-making\n\u2022 What my husband and I experienced this week\n\u2022 Why informed consent becomes complicated inside the organization\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered what really happens in these situations \u2014 or if you\u2019ve been through something similar \u2014 you\u2019re not alone.

My hope is that by opening up about my story, others who are experiencing religious shunning, family cut-offs, or conditional love will feel a little less alone.\n\n\uD83C\uDF3C Topics in this video:\n\u2022 Why my JW family is shunning me\n\u2022 What led up to the family shunning\n\u2022 Emotional impact of religious shunning\n\u2022 How shunning affects families and relationships\n\u2022 Healing after being cut off\n\u2022 My personal journey beyond the Watchtower\n\nIf you\u2019ve experienced Jehovah\u2019s Witness shunning, religious shunning, family estrangement, or pressure to cut off a loved one, I hope this video helps you feel understood and supported.\n\n\uD83D\uDC9B You\u2019re always welcome here.\nThank you for being part of this community, for sharing your experiences, and for walking this path with me.

      "description": "Formerly JW Researcher Rose, in this video I uncover who Johannes Greber was \u2014 and how his Bible translation, connected to spiritism, was actually referenced in multiple Watchtower publications and even influenced parts of the New World Translation.\n\nThrough documented evidence from Watchtower publications and correspondence, I show how Greber\u2019s Bible translation was cited multiple times, even in explaining verses central to the New World Translation.  Main verses like John 1:1 and Matt 27:52-54\n\nThis video explores how that connection was later quietly removed, what it reveals \nabout source vetting inside the organization, and what this means for those who trusted the Watchtower\u2019s scholarship.\n\n\uD83D\uDD0D All references shown in this video come directly from Watchtower publications and historical archives.\n\uD83D\uDCAC I encourage you to comment below with your thoughts \u2014 or any references you\u2019ve found related to this topic.\n\n\nAs someone who spent decades inside the organization, learning this shocked me \u2014 and it may surprise you too.\n\n\uD83D\uDD14 Subscribe for more historical and personal insights into the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society.\n\n\uD83C\uDFA7 Watch More Research:\n\uD83D\uDC49https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7y1oPawaRY9aR2y-MHhB3KsLgb-reYId",

      "description": "For decades, shunning has been one of the most painful and defining parts of life inside the Watchtower organization. Families torn apart. Friends lost overnight. Many of us know that pain firsthand.\nBut lately\u2026 something feels different. I\u2019ve noticed subtle changes \u2014 not just in wording, but in tone and attitude \u2014 that suggest Watchtower may be quietly softening its stance on shunning.\nIn this video I have a conversation with my husband, I\u2019ll share what we\u2019ve observed, compare it to past teachings, and explain what this could mean for those still inside and those who\u2019ve left.\nIf you\u2019ve ever been affected by shunning, or if you\u2019re just trying to understand what\u2019s really happening, I hope this helps you see the bigger picture.\n\n\uD83C\uDF39 Please like, comment, and subscribe to help this reach others who might need it.Your story matters, and you\u2019re not alone.\n\nVideo clips and image sources\nPexels\nAI\nWatchtower publications at jw.org  If publication has been removed from that website please see  https://jws-library.one\nMe",

      "description": "Rose here. In this video I dive into a simple but powerful question: who is our mediator?  As one of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses who are we taught is our mediator?  Who do we go through so Jehovah will hear our prayers \u2014 and what does the Bible actually say about it? \n\nI compare translations, quote key scriptures (1 Timothy 2:5, John 14:6, Hebrews, Acts), and look at the Watchtower\u2019s teaching that Jesus is only the mediator for the anointed. Then I ask the obvious question: does that line up with Scripture?\n\n What you\u2019ll find in this video:\n\u2022 A plain-English definition of \u201Cmediator\u201D\n\u2022 Side-by-side verses from different translations (NIV, KJV, NWT)\n\u2022 Why Jesus being \u201Cthe way\u201D matters for everyone \u2014 not just a select few\n\u2022 A look at Matthew 24:4\u20135 and why claiming to speak for Jesus is problematic\n\u2022 My conclusion from Bible passages and what that means for you\n\n(Stay to the end to hear a short comment from a man defending the men in New York)\n\n\uD83D\uDCAC I want to hear from you \u2014 tell me what you think in the comments.

      "description": "How exactly did the term \u0022Faithful Slave\u0022 for all mankind around the world become the men in New York?  Charles was becoming extremely dogmatic in what and how the Bible Students believed regarding the Bible.  Like the Governing Body have always been with all witnesses around the world. Charles was also caught doing some very questionable, unscrupulous business dealings with the Watchtower funds they received from their members.  Like the organization does with all of the donations they receive today.  So Charles wife had to come up with a solution to make him not look so bad.  And that my friends is how the doctrine and teaching of the \u0022Faithful and Discreet Slave\u0022 came into existence.  You\u0027re just going to have to watch the video to see why and how she did it!  \n\nIt seems arrogant men who want to keep their control like Russell had, have kept what a woman did and claimed to save her husbands reputation and ego.   Why?  To keep that control for themselves for 145 years.  About time they are called out!\n\nI was born and raised as one of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses.

      "description": "I\u0027m not joking it really is a crazy ride.  It\u0027s amazing to me how alike the beginning of the Mormon religion and Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses are with how they got their start.  One guy could read rocks in a special bucket with something covering his head.  (It really is a great story let me tell you!!  I might have to do a video)  The other guy went around spouting everyone needed to repent because Armageddon was happening anytime and everyone was going to be taken to heaven.  He just couldn\u0027t make up his mind when.  \n\nRussell  worked as a partner with his dad selling mens clothing.  Sold it for a ton of money.   Got all these crazy guys spouting their teachings of that time together, and turned them into his own interpretation.   Then got two friends to put his predictions in their magazines and newspaper.  Nada.  Nothing happened.  But that wasn\u0027t going to stop young Charles T Russell who was determined - I prefer to say arrogant - to come up with his own explanations of what HE believed and his interpretations.  It didn\u0027t matter if they were true or not.  So he started a magazine to spout them.\n\nThe Mormon religion started with a poor farm boy in upstate New York.  He was determined to take his personal writings that were written under extremely questionable means and preach them to everyone as absolute fact and truth. \n\nThe other a rich clothing store kid.  A guy who knew just enough to be dangerous when it came to the Bible.   He couldn\u0027t read Greek.  He couldn\u0027t read Hebrew.  The only thing he was really good at was copying someone else\u0027s interpretations and saying he came up with them himself.  That\u0027s who started what eventually became known as the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society.  Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses.   Crazy I tell ya!!  Hope you enjoy it\n\nI was born and raised as one of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses.  My parents met while serving under Nathan Knorr in the late 50\u0027s through the mid 60\u0027s.

How did Christmas go from being celebrated to a disfellowshipping offense?\n\nI hope you enjoy this video\n\nLink to Playlist about 1916-1919 - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7y1oPawaRY8z-5g3NYszlWYiIh_rWMhf\nLink to video about pagan practices still practiced by Witnesses - https://youtu.be/uCrrRR7qWn0?si=Qw0WBPL8XGnSzgAc\n\n\nStock footage credit - @Pexel.com",

Witnesses are no longer required to track their time, publications given out or videos shown.  They currently check a box if they \u0022shared in any form in the ministry during the month\u0022.  10/2023 annual meeting\n2.  New understanding of being able to change your mind regarding choosing or returning to the organization during the Great Tribulation \u0022up to\u0022 armageddon.  Prior to that the understanding was that the Great Tribulation was the \u0022Cut Off\u0022 date for all those that did not become one of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses. 10/2023 annual meeting\n3.  Clarification made to all Witnesses worldwide that \u0022the Governing Body do not have a problem with men having a beard.\u0022  Beards started to immediately be seen on brothers in Bethel with Governing Body member Geoffrey Jackson seen sporting a beard.  Beards exploded in the congregations. 12/2023 update\n4.  Women can wear pants to meetings and service, they are only required to wear a skirt/dress on stage.  Men don\u0027t have to wear a tie or jacket to meeting or service, they are only required to wear one on stage. 3/2024 update\n5.  Noah did not lead a preaching campaign to reach everyone living on earth before the Flood as was once taught - May 2024 Watchtower\n6.  The \u0022Good News\u0022 will not reach everyone before the Great Tribulation as once stated it will - May 2024 Watchtower\n7.  No more marking from the stage.  It is now a personal decision -  August 2024 Watchtower\n8.  You are now able to invite a disfellowshipped one to the meeting and say a greeting to them - August 2024 Watchtower\n9.  The word disfellowshipped will now be replaced with \u0022removed from the congregation\u0022 -August 2024 Watchtower\n\nThe Watchtower organization has been able to erase and change its history regarding past beliefs and understanding.  It\u0027s even easier now that everything is digital. I want to make sure the past isn\u0027t forgotten like the organization wants it to be.  Like they are trying to erase my history now.\n\n\nLink to my channel - https://www.youtube.com/@jwresearcherrose/featured\nLink to history on the Governing Body - https://youtu.be/ozzcbFAxmis?si=mDnklkXQ1JnavB54\n\n\nStock footage credit -  pexels.com",

But if someone leaves the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society due to its practice of not protecting children from child sexual abuse and protecting pedophiles, or the ongoing changes of teachings they have found to be false as well as the organizations lies regarding the history of the organization they find, they are to be shunned.

      "description": "Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses history of the evolving \u0022Governing body\u0022 and how they came to have the complete authority they have now.  \n\nIt\u2019s very important to remember the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society is a Corporate Business entity.  At one time the Governing Body were only administrators of this corporate entity until they separated themselves from legal corporate matters in 2001.  Over the last one hundred years their control over all Witnesses lives have got them the authority they now have.\n\nMy interpretation of the \u201CGoverning Body\u201D through my research is that Joseph Rutherford wanted power and got it when he did his coup of Watchtower in 1917/18. \u00A0\n\nAfter Rutherford\u2019s death Fred Franz and Nathan Knorr started to turn the organization into the direction they wanted it to go.  This was after they told Hayden Covington he couldn\u2019t be President because he wasn\u2019t anointed.  Once Nathan Knorr became President he and Fred Franz started making all of these doctrinal changes and basically did whatever they wanted. The rest of the board stepped in and voted for more than one man to be in charge of the organization.\u00A0What Charles Russell had originally intended but Rutherford just ignored.  That is why there is more than one man now as the \u0022Faithful Slave\u0022.\n\nI think Knorr was a great administrator and that is how he grew the organization to the extent he did.\u00A0 Franz was this crazy bible thumper that had all these ideas he wanted put as \u201Ctruths of the bible\u201D.\u00A0 These two men ran everything and my personal opinion is the rest of the board wanted to reign them in and that\u0027s how we got the arrangement we have today.\n\nThey turned a Publishing corporation into a worldwide religion\n\nNow all men on the Governing Body - that was once made up of only board members - became supreme authority over all of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses today.  As Russell, Rutherford and Knorr once were in their day.\n\nA group of men who by their own admissions state they are imperfect, fallible and not inspired, so not spirit directed.  Yet they speak on behalf of Jesus.  I\u0027m not sure how that works.\n\nJust men with their own interpretations of the Bible just like Charles Russell, Joseph Rutherford, Nathan Knorr and all the men had who have followed.  \n\nNow instead of a Publishing company the organization is a Real Estate holding, video production company promoting their website\n\nIt\u2019s not new light when something is changed.  It\u2019s just other mens interpretations of what their predecessors stated as truth.
