Charles was becoming extremely dogmatic in what and how the Bible Students believed regarding the Bible.  Like the Governing Body have always been with all witnesses around the world. Charles was also caught doing some very questionable, unscrupulous business dealings with the Watchtower funds they received from their members.  Like the organization does with all of the donations they receive today.  So Charles wife had to come up with a solution to make him not look so bad.  And that my friends is how the doctrine and teaching of the \u0022Faithful and Discreet Slave\u0022 came into existence.  You\u0027re just going to have to watch the video to see why and how she did it!  \n\nIt seems arrogant men who want to keep their control like Russell had, have kept what a woman did and claimed to save her husbands reputation and ego.   Why?  To keep that control for themselves for 145 years.  About time they are called out!\n\nI was born and raised as one of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses.

      "description": "I\u0027m not joking it really is a crazy ride.  It\u0027s amazing to me how alike the beginning of the Mormon religion and Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses are with how they got their start.  One guy could read rocks in a special bucket with something covering his head.  (It really is a great story let me tell you!!  I might have to do a video)  The other guy went around spouting everyone needed to repent because Armageddon was happening anytime and everyone was going to be taken to heaven.  He just couldn\u0027t make up his mind when.  \n\nRussell  worked as a partner with his dad selling mens clothing.  Sold it for a ton of money.   Got all these crazy guys spouting their teachings of that time together, and turned them into his own interpretation.   Then got two friends to put his predictions in their magazines and newspaper.  Nada.  Nothing happened.  But that wasn\u0027t going to stop young Charles T Russell who was determined - I prefer to say arrogant - to come up with his own explanations of what HE believed and his interpretations.  It didn\u0027t matter if they were true or not.  So he started a magazine to spout them.\n\nThe Mormon religion started with a poor farm boy in upstate New York.  He was determined to take his personal writings that were written under extremely questionable means and preach them to everyone as absolute fact and truth. \n\nThe other a rich clothing store kid.  A guy who knew just enough to be dangerous when it came to the Bible.   He couldn\u0027t read Greek.  He couldn\u0027t read Hebrew.  The only thing he was really good at was copying someone else\u0027s interpretations and saying he came up with them himself.  That\u0027s who started what eventually became known as the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society.  Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses.   Crazy I tell ya!!  Hope you enjoy it\n\nI was born and raised as one of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses.  My parents met while serving under Nathan Knorr in the late 50\u0027s through the mid 60\u0027s.

Witnesses are no longer required to track their time, publications given out or videos shown.  They currently check a box if they \u0022shared in any form in the ministry during the month\u0022.  10/2023 annual meeting\n2.  New understanding of being able to change your mind regarding choosing or returning to the organization during the Great Tribulation \u0022up to\u0022 armageddon.  Prior to that the understanding was that the Great Tribulation was the \u0022Cut Off\u0022 date for all those that did not become one of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses. 10/2023 annual meeting\n3.  Clarification made to all Witnesses worldwide that \u0022the Governing Body do not have a problem with men having a beard.\u0022  Beards started to immediately be seen on brothers in Bethel with Governing Body member Geoffrey Jackson seen sporting a beard.  Beards exploded in the congregations. 12/2023 update\n4.  Women can wear pants to meetings and service, they are only required to wear a skirt/dress on stage.  Men don\u0027t have to wear a tie or jacket to meeting or service, they are only required to wear one on stage. 3/2024 update\n5.  Noah did not lead a preaching campaign to reach everyone living on earth before the Flood as was once taught - May 2024 Watchtower\n6.  The \u0022Good News\u0022 will not reach everyone before the Great Tribulation as once stated it will - May 2024 Watchtower\n7.  No more marking from the stage.  It is now a personal decision -  August 2024 Watchtower\n8.  You are now able to invite a disfellowshipped one to the meeting and say a greeting to them - August 2024 Watchtower\n9.  The word disfellowshipped will now be replaced with \u0022removed from the congregation\u0022 -August 2024 Watchtower\n\nThe Watchtower organization has been able to erase and change its history regarding past beliefs and understanding.  It\u0027s even easier now that everything is digital. I want to make sure the past isn\u0027t forgotten like the organization wants it to be.  Like they are trying to erase my history now.\n\n\nLink to my channel - https://www.youtube.com/@jwresearcherrose/featured\nLink to history on the Governing Body - https://youtu.be/ozzcbFAxmis?si=mDnklkXQ1JnavB54\n\n\nStock footage credit -  pexels.com",

But if someone leaves the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society due to its practice of not protecting children from child sexual abuse and protecting pedophiles, or the ongoing changes of teachings they have found to be false as well as the organizations lies regarding the history of the organization they find, they are to be shunned.

Here is what Witnesses are seeing now along with the Watchtowers six explanations of the \u0022Generation\u0022 in 50 years.  Why does the Watchtower organization continue to change who the \u0022Generation\u0022 of Matt 24 is?  So far I have had six completely different explanations.

      "title": "Unquestioned power and authority.  History of the \u201CGoverning Body\u0022",
      "description": "Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses history of the evolving \u0022Governing body\u0022 and how they came to have the complete authority they have now.  \n\nIt\u2019s very important to remember the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society is a Corporate Business entity.  At one time the Governing Body were only administrators of this corporate entity until they separated themselves from legal corporate matters in 2001.  Over the last one hundred years their control over all Witnesses lives have got them the authority they now have.\n\nMy interpretation of the \u201CGoverning Body\u201D through my research is that Joseph Rutherford wanted power and got it when he did his coup of Watchtower in 1917/18. \u00A0\n\nAfter Rutherford\u2019s death Fred Franz and Nathan Knorr started to turn the organization into the direction they wanted it to go.  This was after they told Hayden Covington he couldn\u2019t be President because he wasn\u2019t anointed.  Once Nathan Knorr became President he and Fred Franz started making all of these doctrinal changes and basically did whatever they wanted. The rest of the board stepped in and voted for more than one man to be in charge of the organization.\u00A0What Charles Russell had originally intended but Rutherford just ignored.  That is why there is more than one man now as the \u0022Faithful Slave\u0022.\n\nI think Knorr was a great administrator and that is how he grew the organization to the extent he did.\u00A0 Franz was this crazy bible thumper that had all these ideas he wanted put as \u201Ctruths of the bible\u201D.\u00A0 These two men ran everything and my personal opinion is the rest of the board wanted to reign them in and that\u0027s how we got the arrangement we have today.\n\nThey turned a Publishing corporation into a worldwide religion\n\nNow all men on the Governing Body - that was once made up of only board members - became supreme authority over all of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses today.  As Russell, Rutherford and Knorr once were in their day.\n\nA group of men who by their own admissions state they are imperfect, fallible and not inspired, so not spirit directed.  Yet they speak on behalf of Jesus.  I\u0027m not sure how that works.\n\nJust men with their own interpretations of the Bible just like Charles Russell, Joseph Rutherford, Nathan Knorr and all the men had who have followed.  \n\nNow instead of a Publishing company the organization is a Real Estate holding, video production company promoting their website\n\nIt\u2019s not new light when something is changed.  It\u2019s just other mens interpretations of what their predecessors stated as truth.

Did you even know that disfellowshipping hasn\u0027t always been a practiced by Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses?\n\nIn March of 2023 all religious status was removed in Norway due to the disfellowshipping arrangement which meant the organization lost roughly $1,778,793 in U.S. dollars in governmental support annually.  About $140 per member.\n\nThe organization was ordered pay to  NOK 100,000 ($9,010 US dollars) in damages, NOK 512,063.50 ($46,902 US dollars) as expenses for the Court of Appeal case, and NOK 386,082 ($34,789 US) for the expenses before the District Court.  All paid through the voluntary donations that were supposed to be used for the Worldwide preaching work.  Donations which are now considered part of all Witnesses sacred service.\n\nLink to my channel:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRKbc7PcKyz350FZHyjjF4A\nLink to the Watchtower organizations publications since 1878 - https://jws-library.one\n\nPlease keep searching.\n\n\n\n\n#jehovah #jehova #jehovahwitnesses #jehovahswitnesses #watchtower #exjehovahswitness #exjw #exjwsthink #exjwsupport #jw #disfellowship #jehovahswitnessdocumentary #exjehovahwitness #exjehovahswitness  #religioustrauma",
