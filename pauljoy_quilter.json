      "description": "The Watchtower Organization instructs Jehovahs Winesses to shun those who leave or are \u0022spiritually weak\u0022, to keep acquaintances at arms length and only make friends amongst other witnesses. Joy discusses how shunning affects you and how JWs view you as scum if you leave the religion. How the Jehovahs Witness religion keeps you so busy that you do not have time to associate with normal non JW people and make friends outside the religion. This intentional isolation is designed to prevent you from leaving, as you will lose your entire support network. Joy encourages getting out and re-kindling friendships outside.",
