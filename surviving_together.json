Her messages offer victims of childhood trauma keys to healing and offer insights for helping lift those who struggle on their healing journey. She currently volunteers with her local Suicide Prevention Network as a PTSD support group facilitator and has worked as a CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocate) on behalf of abused and neglected children. \n\nTammy hosts two podcast series: Survivor Shift: Moving from Surviving to Thriving where she interviews others about critical shifts in thought and behavior that allowed them to move forward after trauma; Building on the Light\u0027s guests share pieces of light they\u0027ve discovered that help them continue to build a life they can thrive in. You can find both podcasts on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/@TammyRene915\n\nShe is the author of her bestselling and award-winning memoir, Miracles in the Dark: How a Childhood Cult and Abuse Victim Reclaimed the Light.
