Will takes us on a hilarious journey through the utterly absurd world of modern politics and conspiracy theories, showcasing the power of humour in tackling even the most serious subjects. From his unexpected leap into satire to his unique comedic style, Will shares some fantastic stories about how he uses humour to navigate the complexities of our times. We delve into the bizarre realities that often outdo even the wildest conspiracy theories, and explore how charismatic figures like Liz Truss can shape public opinion. We also discuss the role of media in shaping our perceptions, the strange allure of conspiracy theories, and the science behind why we believe what we do. Plus, we tackle the ever-changing world of social media, its impact on our mental health, and the challenges of dealing with online trolls. Join us for a conversation that\u0027s both thought-provoking and laugh-out-loud funny, and reminds us why critical thinking is more important than ever in these times of misinformation.

In this follow-up episode, we focus on the latest developments concerning Richard D. Hall, a prominent figure in the conspiracy theory community. Hall, once a skeptic of hoax theories, has become one of their most vocal proponents, particularly regarding the tragic events at Manchester Arena in 2017. We trace Hall\u0027s journey from a non-believer to a firm advocate of hoax conspiracy theories, exploring the pivotal moments and influences that led to his transformation. Our investigation takes us through his controversial claims and the legal challenges he faces after alleging that the bombing was staged. We also discuss the profound impact of these claims on survivors, including Martin and Eve Hibbert, who have courageously spoken out against such theories. Join us as we unravel the complexities of belief, skepticism, and misinformation in today\u0027s digital age.

In tonight\u0027s episode, we dissect the provocative documentary \u0022Lawfare\u0022 by Tommy Robinson, once a prominent figure in the English Defence League. We critically examine Robinson\u0027s narrative, exposing manipulative editing, factual distortions, and propagandistic techniques. Throughout the episode, we discuss Robinson\u0027s controversial past, the misuse of statistics, and the portrayal of extremist views as common sense.\n\nWe\u0027ll question Robinson\u0027s self-proclaimed crusade against a so-called totalitarian state, while highlighting his own history of inciting division and exploiting sensitive topics like immigration, race, and public health. From comical misrepresentations to dangerous rhetoric, we leave no stone unturned. We also share personal anecdotes and historical context, bringing to light the ongoing struggle against right-wing mobilizations and the importance of preserving truth and integrity. So grab your popcorn and get ready for an enlightening and entertaining deconstruction of a film that aims to provoke but falls flat under scrutiny.\n\nBecome a supporter of this podcast: https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/some-dare-call-it-conspiracy--5932731/support.",

In today\u0027s episode, we had the pleasure of sitting down with Mike Wendling, a national digital reporter for the BBC who specializes in covering disinformation and conspiracy theories.\n\nMike shared some truly eye-opening insights from his experiences investigating far-right extremist groups in the US. We delved into the complex web of conspiracy theories surrounding major events and how they\u0027re exploited to politically radicalize people.\n\nIt was sobering to hear how fringe ideas, once confined to the darkest corners of the internet, are now being laundered into mainstream political talking points by media pundits and elected officials alike. Mike\u0027s firsthand accounts of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers revealed the contradictory nature of these groups.\n\nThis episode highlighted the critical need for responsible journalism to combat the insidious spread of disinformation in our society.

      "title": "*The Nut Roast* - Cutting Through The Grime (Darren Grimes Dismantled)",
      "description": "Cutting Through the Grime: Unveiling Darren Grimes\u2019s Misinformation Campaign In this episode of \u0022Nut Roast with Neil Sanders,\u0022 host Neil Sanders dissects the controversial opinions and misinformation tactics employed by Darren Grimes on his GB News show, \u0022The Saturday Five.\u0022 Sanders provides a comprehensive critique of Grimes, shedding light on his dubious past, his connections, and his role as a mouthpiece for far-right propaganda. Darren Grimes might be a familiar name to viewers of GB News, but his journey in the political and journalistic landscape is riddled with controversy and contradictions. Originally an activist for the Liberal Democrats, Grimes shifted dramatically to support Brexit, working with organisations embroiled in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Sanders describes Grimes as a \u0022haunted ventriloquist dummy,\u0022 emphasising his role as a puppet manipulated by hidden hands. In 2016, Grimes helped form BeLeave, a spin-off of Vote Leave, embroiled in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The use of unauthorised data to influence public opinion is a dark chapter in the history of Brexit, and Grimes was fined for his involvement, although the fine was later overturned. Sanders points out the disturbing connections between Grimes and organisations keen on undermining public trust and manipulating voter behaviour. Grimes\u0027s transformation from a pro-EU activist to a pro-Brexit propagandist is stark. His association with the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) and the formation of Turning Point UK, closely connected to Koch Industries, underline his shift towards far-right populism. Sanders describes this transition as a career move akin to Darth Vader\u0027s, highlighting the moral and ethical questions surrounding Grimes\u0027s motivations. Grimes\u0027s current role as a presenter for GB News is seen by Sanders as part of a broader strategy to disseminate far-right propaganda. GB News, funded by think tanks and billionaires with vested interests, is depicted as a hub for bigotry and misinformation. Sanders\u0027s caustic humour and sharp critique expose the channel\u0027s amateurish and chaotic operations. The focal point of this episode is Grimes\u0027s defence of Nigel Farage\u0027s statements on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Farage\u0027s claim that NATO provoked Russia\u2019s actions is vehemently supported by Grimes, despite being widely debunked. Sanders meticulously debunks Farage\u0027s statements and exposes them as Kremlin propaganda, reflecting a dangerous alignment with Russian disinformation tactics. Sanders provides critical historical context to counter the narrative pushed by Grimes and Farage. He explains that Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine stems from long-standing geopolitical tensions, not NATO\u0027s actions. The annexation of Crimea in 2014 and subsequent military incursions are rooted in Russia\u0027s desire to control Ukraine, not NATO expansion as propagated by Farage and supported by Grimes on GB News. Grimes\u0027s performance as a presenter and his handling of the debate reveal his lack of knowledge and preparation. Sanders critiques Grimes\u0027s inability to engage meaningfully with complex geopolitical issues, instead resorting to deflection and obfuscation. This is emblematic of a broader trend of misinformation and shallow analysis prevalent in far-right media circles. Sanders doesn\u2019t shy away from discussing the darker allegations against Grimes. The claims of persistent sexual harassment of a colleague and the notorious \u0022crafty w**k\u0022 incident add to the sordid image Sanders paints. These allegations, true or not, contribute to the negative public perception of Grimes and highlight the ethical void in his professional conduct. \u0022Cutting Through the Grime\u0022 does more than critique a single GB News segment; it delves deep into the mechanisms of far-right propaganda, the ethical failings of its proponents, and the dangers of misinformation. Sanders\u2019s scathing yet insightful analysis lays bare the hollow rhetoric and manipulative tactics of Darren Grimes and his ilk. This episode serves as a stark reminder of the need for critical thinking and informed discourse in the face of pervasive and pernicious misinformation. \u0026#x1f525;\u0026#x1f989;\u0026#x1f525; - Some Dare Call It Conspiracy is produced entirely by Brent Lee and Neil Sanders.

The Dark Money Influencing PoliticsOne of the most compelling topics discussed is the concept of \u0022dark money.\u0022 Large corporations funnel significant amounts of undisclosed funds into politics to steer policies and public opinion in their favor. This clandestine funding mechanism has far-reaching implications, influencing everything from healthcare reforms to deregulation policies. By highlighting this issue, the podcast underscores the urgent need for transparency and accountability in government affairs. Political Entertainers: The Rise of a New ClassThe conversation extends to the rise of political entertainers such as Lawrence Fox, Calvin Robinson, and Ben Shapiro. These figures have capitalized on the merging of entertainment and politics to spread their ideologies. Otto English criticizes this trend, arguing that it undermines serious political discourse and fosters a climate where racist and bigoted statements can be made without consequence. There\u0027s a call for regulatory intervention to curb these harmful narratives and restore integrity to political discussions. The Curious Case of Ancestry and MonarchyOtto English then touches upon the fascinating topic of ancestry and its implications. Highlighting how Boris Johnson and David Cameron discovered their royal lineage on the show \u0022Who Do You Think You Are?\u0022, he suggests that almost everyone with one European ancestor in the last hundred years likely descends from historical figures like Charlemagne or King John. This revelation serves as a reminder that lineage and ancestry often carry unexpected connections and histories. The Inextricable Link Between History and MediaMedia representations of history can significantly influence public perception. The podcast discusses how movies, such as Oliver Stone\u0027s \u0022JFK,\u0022 perpetuate conspiracy theories and shape historical narratives. Otto English points out that while such films can be entertaining, they can also distort historical facts, creating misconceptions that linger in public consciousness. The Problem with Sudden ElectionsThe hosts delve into the reasons behind a prime minister calling a sudden election. This often perplexing political move may be motivated by a range of factors, from internal party dynamics to personal considerations, such as securing a family break in California. Understanding these underlying motivations can demystify political maneuvers that often seem abrupt and inexplicable to the public. Reflecting on Brexit and Its Ideological RootsA significant portion of the discussion focuses on Brexit and the ideologies driving it. Otto English highlights how Brexit was shaped by a nostalgic longing for a mythical British past and aristocratic interests. The conversation also touches upon the influence of American organizations like the Heritage Foundation on English think tanks, pushing for privatization and wealth accumulation. This ideological cross-pollination has profound implications for the UK\u0027s political landscape. The Fetishization of Historical FiguresThe podcast critiques the fetishization of historical figures such as Winston Churchill and John F. Kennedy. Otto English argues that this glorification often ignores the complex and multifaceted realities of these individuals. By oversimplifying their legacies, society perpetuates myths that can misinform and mislead. Prince Andrew and the Epstein ScandalThe conversation takes a critical turn as Otto English addresses the scandal involving Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein. He condemns Prince Andrew\u0027s friendship with Epstein and the subsequent attempts to justify this relationship. This discussion emphasizes the importance of accountability and ethical behavior, even within the highest echelons of society. The Influence of Farage and the Reform PartyNigel Farage and the Reform Party also come under scrutiny. The hosts explore Farage\u0027s media influence and political maneuvers, expressing concerns about his cult-like following and the potential dangers of complacency in politics. Otto English\u0027s prediction that Trump might lose the US election, coupled with his ambivalence about Farage\u0027s potential win in Clacton, underscores the precarious nature of contemporary politics. ConclusionIn this episode of \u0022Some Dare Call It Conspiracy,\u0022 the hosts and Otto English offer a thought-provoking exploration of the forces shaping our world. From the shadowy influence of dark money to the distortions of historical narratives and the rise of political entertainers, the discussion provides a nuanced understanding of contemporary political and social issues. This episode serves as a clarion call for greater transparency, accountability, and critical engagement with the forces that govern our lives. \u0026#x1f525;\u0026#x1f989;\u0026#x1f525; In the last few years we have seen a significant rise in the belief of conspiracy theories.

      "description": "Hello Initiates! Apologies for the delay, we\u0027ve been experiencing some technical difficulties... it must be that pesky Illuminati trying to silence us! lol Anyway, thanks for your patience and support! Here is a brand new episode: Turning Chaos Into Comedy The Barney Farmer (VIZ) Interview In this insightful episode of \u0022Some Dare Call It Conspiracy,\u0022 host Neil Sanders chats with Barney Farmer, the creative mind behind iconic characters like the Drunken Bakers and Male Online. The conversation dives deep into the roots of his satirical work, the changing landscape of conspiracy theories, and the fine line between edgy comedy and offensive material. Male Online: Inspired by Reality Barney Farmer shares that the inspiration for his character Male Online came from reading the polarizing comments on The Daily Mail website. He observed older right-wing activists sharpening their skills online, embodying a raw, unfiltered form of social commentary. Drunken Bakers: From Pub Observations to Comic Strips Farmer recounts how experiences at a pub and a pie shop laid the groundwork for his despondent yet relatable characters in \u0022Drunken Bakers.\u0022 Despite the bleak environment of the north, the humor struck a chord with readers, blending wit with melancholy. Offering Meaning in a World of Uncertainty Farmer acknowledges that both religion and science provide meaning, despite their different approaches. Where religion fills the void of existential and moral queries, science offers explanations grounded in empirical evidence. Conspiracies: A Symptom of a Troubled Society? Farmer and Sanders explore the notion that conspiracy theories serve as a coping mechanism for those grappling with the chaos and unpredictability of the world. The comfort lies in believing that events unfold according to a grand plan, even if it\u0027s a nefarious one. Our conversation with Barney Farmer offers a kaleidoscope of insights into the intricate blend of humor, politics, and societal observations that define his work. From exploring the genesis of beloved characters to the nuanced navigation of conspiracy theories and modern societal dynamics, this episode provides a rich tapestry of thought and laughter, weaving together the many facets of Farmer\u0027s comedic genius. \u0026#x1f525;\u0026#x1f989;\u0026#x1f525; In the last few years we have seen a significant rise in the belief of conspiracy theories.

      "description": "History is a lie agreed upon, and so is the present day when navigating the narratives of the internet\u0027s conspiracy crowd. But luckily we have a swathe of talking heads who are here to separate the wheat from the chaff, sift through the bullshit and amplify the white in the white noise. They are here to tell us the truth, no matter how unpalatable, bigoted and fallacious this might seem to reasonable or informed people. In the USA they have entire networks dedicated to distributing this modern day two minutes of hate. It can be highly lucrative to wind up the credulous and furious, and these outlets namely The Daily Wire, OAN, Rebel TV, Turning Point and others do very well and have directed more people to the right wing than a stewardess during a crash landing. These outlets can loosely be described as purveyors of news, in the same way that a dirty protest can loosely be described as an example of elegant home decoration. In the UK we have the propaganda Network GB News and Talk TV. They are very much the Robbie Williams to America\u2019s Justin Timberlake in this regard, the Jim Davidson to their Dave Chappelle or the Scunthorpe united to their Dallas Cowboys. Essentially they do the same thing but with wildly different standards of aesthetics and with far less talent, charisma, skill and panache. The main through-line is a mixture of right wing and far right politics and performative outrage deployed through the lens of conspiracy and faux anti government sentiment. But, as I believe Shakespeare once said, there are levels to this shit. If we think of Alex Jones and David Icke as top billing prize fighters slugging it out against the illuminati on a pay per view from Las Vegas, then people like Russel Brand, Laurence Fox and their ilk are a man killing rats with a hammer in a ring of hay-bales in the dimly lit back room of an abandoned warehouse in Kidderminster. \u0026#x1f525;\u0026#x1f989;\u0026#x1f525; In the last few years we have seen a significant rise in the belief of conspiracy theories.

      "description": "Please be aware, this series will be examining a deadly bombing and we will be discussing details of death and injury. Listener discretion is advised. Examining the Conspiracy Theories Around the Manchester Arena Bombing The 2017 Manchester Arena bombing was a tragic event that left 22 people dead and hundreds more injured. However, in the years since, a number of conspiracy theories have emerged claiming the attack was a hoax. One of the main proponents of this theory is Richard D. Hall, who has produced a book and documentary called \u0022The Night of the Bang\u0022 alleging the victims were crisis actors. In this 8-part podcast series, we aim to meticulously examine the claims made by Hall and others, assess the evidence, and uncover the truth behind this divisive event. As content creators, we recognize the responsibility we have to approach these sensitive discussions with great care. The first half of the series will present Hall\u0027s arguments and the conspiracy theory in detail. We will then spend the second half deconstructing these claims and determining where the truth lies. This balanced approach is crucial, as conspiracy theories around tragic events can have devastating consequences. We\u0027ve already seen how these false narratives can fracture communities and lead to the harassment of victims and their families. The recent legal action taken by Manchester Arena survivors Martin and Eve Hibbert against Hall is a landmark case, the first of its kind in the UK against a \u0022disaster troll.\u201D The Hibberts are seeking an injunction to prevent Hall from making similar allegations in the future, as well as damages. Their lawyer has described Hall\u0027s actions as \u0022appalling\u0022 and hopes this case will set a precedent to better protect survivors of tragedies from such harassment. This issue also highlights the challenges lawmakers and social media platforms face in addressing the spread of disinformation and abuse online. While new legislation like the UK\u0027s Online Safety Bill aims to improve user protections, there are still debates over how far such laws can and should go. Ultimately, the Manchester Arena bombing conspiracy theories demonstrate the very real harm that can result when facts are obscured and victims are re-traumatized. As we delve into this complex topic, our goal is to provide a thoughtful, nuanced examination - one that honours the memory of those lost and supports the recovery of the survivors. By rigorously analysing the evidence and ethical implications, we hope to cut through the noise and misinformation, offering listeners a clearer understanding of this tragic event and the importance of responsible journalism in the face of conspiracy theories.

In this 8-part podcast series, we aim to meticulously examine the claims made by Hall and others, assess the evidence, and uncover the truth behind this divisive event. As content creators, we recognize the responsibility we have to approach these sensitive discussions with great care. The first half of the series will present Hall\u0027s arguments and the conspiracy theory in detail. We will then spend the second half deconstructing these claims and determining where the truth lies. This balanced approach is crucial, as conspiracy theories around tragic events can have devastating consequences. We\u0027ve already seen how these false narratives can fracture communities and lead to the harassment of victims and their families. The recent legal action taken by Manchester Arena survivors Martin and Eve Hibbert against Hall is a landmark case, the first of its kind in the UK against a \u0022disaster troll.\u201D The Hibberts are seeking an injunction to prevent Hall from making similar allegations in the future, as well as damages. Their lawyer has described Hall\u0027s actions as \u0022appalling\u0022 and hopes this case will set a precedent to better protect survivors of tragedies from such harassment. This issue also highlights the challenges lawmakers and social media platforms face in addressing the spread of disinformation and abuse online. While new legislation like the UK\u0027s Online Safety Bill aims to improve user protections, there are still debates over how far such laws can and should go. Ultimately, the Manchester Arena bombing conspiracy theories demonstrate the very real harm that can result when facts are obscured and victims are re-traumatized. As we delve into this complex topic, our goal is to provide a thoughtful, nuanced examination - one that honours the memory of those lost and supports the recovery of the survivors. By rigorously analysing the evidence and ethical implications, we hope to cut through the noise and misinformation, offering listeners a clearer understanding of this tragic event and the importance of responsible journalism in the face of conspiracy theories.

      "description": "Hello initiates... a few months ago we found out that our dear friend Jitarth Jadeja had passed away. For those who don\u0027t know, Jitarth was a former conspiracist and follower of QANON who was one of the first former conspiracy theorists speaking out in the media that I heard. He was, and remains, a huge inspiration to me. Back in August 2022, myself, Stephanie Kemmerer and Jitarth sat down for a chat on Zoom to \u0022Discuss Our Unusual Beliefs Together\u0022 - it was the start of a lovely friendship and I wish we had the opportunity to do more of these, as we had planned, but scheduling always got the better of us. This conversation was removed from YouTube because of fraudulent claims so I wanted to reupload it here to keep his memory alive and share with you this wonderful chat with our friend who will be sorely missed. RIP Jitarth Jadeja, our brother. \u2764\uFE0F Become a supporter of this podcast: https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/some-dare-call-it-conspiracy--5932731/support .",

      "description": "Please be aware, this series will be examining a deadly bombing and we will be discussing details of death and injury. Listener discretion is advised. Examining the Conspiracy Theories Around the Manchester Arena Bombing The 2017 Manchester Arena bombing was a tragic event that left 22 people dead and hundreds more injured. However, in the years since, a number of conspiracy theories have emerged claiming the attack was a hoax. One of the main proponents of this theory is Richard D. Hall, who has produced a book and documentary called \u0022The Night of the Bang\u0022 alleging the victims were crisis actors. In this 8-part podcast series, we aim to meticulously examine the claims made by Hall and others, assess the evidence, and uncover the truth behind this divisive event. As content creators, we recognize the responsibility we have to approach these sensitive discussions with great care. The first half of the series will present Hall\u0027s arguments and the conspiracy theory in detail. We will then spend the second half deconstructing these claims and determining where the truth lies. This balanced approach is crucial, as conspiracy theories around tragic events can have devastating consequences. We\u0027ve already seen how these false narratives can fracture communities and lead to the harassment of victims and their families. The recent legal action taken by Manchester Arena survivors Martin and Eve Hibbert against Hall is a landmark case, the first of its kind in the UK against a \u0022disaster troll.\u201D The Hibberts are seeking an injunction to prevent Hall from making similar allegations in the future, as well as damages. Their lawyer has described Hall\u0027s actions as \u0022appalling\u0022 and hopes this case will set a precedent to better protect survivors of tragedies from such harassment. This issue also highlights the challenges lawmakers and social media platforms face in addressing the spread of disinformation and abuse online. While new legislation like the UK\u0027s Online Safety Bill aims to improve user protections, there are still debates over how far such laws can and should go. Ultimately, the Manchester Arena bombing conspiracy theories demonstrate the very real harm that can result when facts are obscured and victims are re-traumatized. As we delve into this complex topic, our goal is to provide a thoughtful, nuanced examination - one that honours the memory of those lost and supports the recovery of the survivors. By rigorously analysing the evidence and ethical implications, we hope to cut through the noise and misinformation, offering listeners a clearer understanding of this tragic event and the importance of responsible journalism in the face of conspiracy theories.

      "description": "Welcome to our Manchester Arena Bombing On Trial series. On the 22nd of May, 2017, Salman Abedi detonated a bomb in the foyer of the Manchester Arena at the end of an Arianna Grande concert killing 22 people and injuring hundreds more. A conspiracy theory claiming that this bombing was hoaxed and everyone involved was a crisis actor soon became a dominant narrative in the Conspirasphere. One of the main proponents of this theory is Richard D Hall. Over the course of this series we will be examining and deconstructing the claims made by Richard D Hall in his book and documentary \u0022Night Of The Bang\u0022 only to discover where the truth lies. As usual, our deep dive series are split into two halves. In the first four episodes we present the conspiracy theory faithfully and with as little judgement as possible. All the while attempting to give our perspective as former believers as to how or why the theory may be believable. In the final four episodes we revisit the theory and provide the often missing context and facts which prove the theory wrong. You have questions? We have answers. Please be aware, this series will be examining a deadly bombing and we will be discussing details of death and injury. Listener discretion is advised. Topics discussed: Episode One - Introducing our new co-host / permanent guest for all of our upcoming deep dive \u0022On Trial\u0022 episodes: Joel Hill Our personal experience with once believing that false flag attacks were commonplace.

      "description": "* Please consider supporting our ambitous project https://www.tinfoilconfessions.com * Neil is back with another scathing review of conspiracy influencer\u0027s desperate bid for relevance. This time, he takes aim at Laurence Fox and Calvin Robinson\u0027s new podcast \u0022Fox And Father\u0022. Here\u0027s an excerpt! So Laurence has done what many others have done when they piss their career away, he has started a youtube/twitter channel where he can hold a flame to the feet of truth, speak freely without fear of repercussions and possibly get away with using the occasional racist epithet. Like adverts for hot girls leaks, these types of shows keep popping up all over twitter, threatening to infect the audience with their edge lord rhetoric. And like said leak videos they are all just a load of arse. The show is called Fox and Father and I was immediately disappointed to realise that this was not an hour of Laurence being berated by his dad for fucking up his life and wasting so many opportunities. The father in question is Calvin Robinson. Calvin has previously tried to become a Deacon in the Church of England but was rejected due to his controversial and bigoted views. This is an organisation that in the past has defended paedophiles within its ranks, and yet it felt that Calvin didn\u2019t quite butter enough parsnips for them. So Calvin became a Deacon in the Free Church of England, which is recognised by the C of E in the same way that Donald Trump recognises his daughter Tiffany, it sometimes vaguely acknowledges the fact that it exists. In 2023 Robinson was ordained in the Nordic Catholic Church (based in Norway) as a Priest. He reminds me of a talentless Canadian ice hockey player who, having been rejected by every team there, tried his luck unsuccessfully in America, the UK and Europe before settling in the second division of some African league in a country where the majority of people have never seen ice. Robinson has previously been involved with various right wing media outlets and has dabbled in reactionary politics. He too was let go by GB News for sticking up for his good buddy Laurence. I did wonder if the show name might be ironic, an acknowledgement of the hosts reputation and an understanding that many people do not see either of them as \u201Cproper fathers\u201D but I doubt they have that level of self awareness. \u0026#x1f525;\u0026#x1f989;\u0026#x1f525; Some Dare Call It Conspiracy is produced entirely by Brent Lee and Neil Sanders.

      "description": "It\u0027s Movie Night with Greg Hall! In today\u0027s episode, Brent Lee puts the guys through absolute hell and makes them watch Plandemic 3: The Great Awakening by film maker Mikki Willis. Enjoy! From Wikipedia \u0022Plandemic is a trilogy of conspiracy theory films produced by Mikki Willis promoting misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. They feature Judy Mikovits, a discredited American researcher and prominent anti-vaccine activist. The first video, Plandemic: The Hidden Agenda Behind Covid-19, was released on May 4, 2020, under Willis\u0027 production company Elevate Films. The second film, Plandemic Indoctornation, which includes more interviewees, was released on August 18 by Brian Rose\u0027s distributor of conspiracy theory related films, London Real. Later on June 3, 2023, Plandemic 3: The Great Awakening was released on The Highwire, a website devoted to conspiracy theories run by anti-vaccine activist Del Bigtree. Upon its release, the first video went viral, becoming one of the most widespread pieces of COVID-19 misinformation, its popularity most attributed to online word-of-mouth. It was quickly removed by multiple online platforms, but this failed to stop its proliferation. The video also contributed to the increasing rebellion against health protocols. Due to social media companies\u0027 preparedness for its release, Plandemic: Indoctornation received less attention. Scientists and health professionals have criticized all the installments of the trilogy for their misleading claims, while Willis\u0027 filmmaking style employing various modes of persuasion has been cited as lending to a conspiratorial and brainwashing character of the film.\u0022 \u0026#x1f525;\u0026#x1f989;\u0026#x1f525; Some Dare Call It Conspiracy is produced entirely by Brent Lee and Neil Sanders.

FUNNY THAT. Neil is one of the few people I can think of who really get this phenomenon. So I had him on for a chat. And it\u0027s good! Could have been twice the length but timezones are a bitch.

      "description": "Full transcript available at https://somedarecallitconspiracy.blogspot.com/2024/02/jon-ronson-interview-transcript.html Jon Ronson on the Allure of Conspiracies and the Culture War Welcome to an exclusive episode of \u0027Some Dare Call It Conspiracy,\u0027 where hosts Neil Sanders and Brent Lee navigate the murky waters of conspiracy theories with guest Jon Ronson, an accomplished author and documentarian. This discussion delved into Ronson\u0027s firsthand experiences with the controversial figure Alex Jones, the shifting landscape of the truth movement, and the thin line between skepticism and belief. Covid, Clots, and Conspiracy Theories Ronson\u0027s personal health scare, contracting Covid-19 and later developing a blood clot, brings a sobering reality to the conversation. It highlights the tangible consequences of the pandemic, contrasting with the rampant Covid denial and misinformation that has infiltrated conspiracy circles. The discussion pivots to the pathological persistence of some conspiracy theorists who refuse to acknowledge their role in spreading harmful misinformation. Examining Alex Jones: A Turn of Perspective Ronson provides a unique perspective on Alex Jones, painting a picture of a man who consistently doubles down on conspiracy theories, potentially for personal gain rather than seeking truth. His recount of the infamous Bohemian Grove event illustrates the complexities and the theatrics of conspiracy narratives. This segues into a discussion of how some figures within the conspiracy community, including Jones, monetize and weaponize uncertainty to their advantage. Cultural Wars and Class Struggles: The Role of Identity Politics The podcast also touches on the cultural wars that are fueled by identity politics and class struggles. The hosts and Ronson debate how these divisive issues distract from the underlying socioeconomic inequalities that benefit the wealthy. They discuss the often-misunderstood or overstated elements of the culture war, designed to generate conflict and division. The Hero\u0027s Journey of Conspiracy Theorists Joseph Campbell\u0027s hero\u0027s journey is a concept that resonates deeply with conspiracy theorists. Ronson\u0027s exploration of this narrative shows that many within the conspiracy community view themselves as reluctant heroes, engaged in an epic struggle against the perceived dragons of society, such as government overreach and hidden crimes. The Skeptic\u0027s Path: From Belief to Disillusionment Sanders and Lee, formerly firm believers in conspiracy theories, share their journeys towards skepticism. They explore the pivotal moments that altered their views, shedding light on the internal conflicts that challenge staunch conspiracy theorists. This transformation from believer to skeptic is rare in a community where doubling down is the norm, providing valuable insights into the psychology of belief systems. In the end, the conversation with Jon Ronson throws a spotlight on the complex, and often contradictory, world of conspiracy theories. Whether as pronounced heroes on a valiant quest or vilified purveyors of falsehoods, conspiracy theorists occupy a controversial space in the collective consciousness. \u0027Some Dare Call It Conspiracy\u0027 invites listeners to critically engage with these narratives and consider their profound impact on society. \u0026#x1f525;\u0026#x1f989;\u0026#x1f525; Some Dare Call It Conspiracy is produced entirely by Brent Lee and Neil Sanders.

He\u0027s been on a weird tirade ever since his embarrassing spat on X (Twitter) with Brent Lee. Since that humiliation, he\u0027s been calling out everyone from Russell Brand and Joe Rogan to Elon Musk and Jordan Peterson. And it\u0027s been very funny.
