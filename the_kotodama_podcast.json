      "description": "What happens when the place that raised you also abused and silenced you?\n\nIn this deeply moving episode of the Kotodama Podcast, I sat down with Lilia Tarawa \u2014 bestselling author, brand coach, and former member of the infamous Gloriavale cult.\n\nBorn into a highly controlling, cult environment, Lilia shared what it\u2019s really like to grow up believing this world is all there is. She opened up about the emotional conflict of belonging and oppression, the cost of losing your voice, and the terrifying freedom that comes with leaving everything you\u2019ve ever known.\n\nTogether, we explores:\n- What life inside a cult really feels like - and why it can be both heaven and hell\n- The hidden trauma of control, shame, and suppressed identity\n- Reclaiming femininity, sexuality, and self-worth after indoctrination\n- Why your story doesn\u2019t need to be sensational to be powerful\n- How storytelling can heal trauma and build authentic personal brands\n- Treating your energy like a multimillion-dollar asset\n- Why healing begins the moment you stop waiting for permission\n\nThis conversation is honest, and deeply empowering \u2014 whether you\u2019ve experienced religious trauma, left a high-control environment, or are simply learning to trust your own voice again.\n\n\u2728 You are the permission you\u2019ve been looking for.\n\u2728 Your story matters.\n\u2728 And healing starts with the choices you make today.\n\nWatch until the end for profound insights on boundaries, mindset, money, identity, and creating a life that actually feels good.\n\n\uD83D\uDD14 Don\u2019t forget to like, comment \u0026 subscribe to watch more conversations like this!! \uD83D\uDC9E\n\nCheck out Lilia\u0027s work and follow her on social media:\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@UCeX_SmMBGyhqukRBKr8LICQ \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/liliatarawa/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@liliatarawa\nTEDTalk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS7mBbXxJYA\nBook: https://books2read.com/u/4NOd1N\n\n\uD83D\uDC49 What part of this episode resonated with you the most?

      "description": "What really happens inside a cult, and how do intelligent, compassionate people get pulled in?\n\nIn this episode of The Kotodama Podcast, I sat down with Diane Benscoter, a former member of the Unification Church (often referred to as \u201CThe Moonies\u201D), who joined at just 17 years old. Diane speaks candidly about the psychological manipulation, identity loss, and emotional hooks that kept her inside, and the long, difficult journey of reclaiming her voice after leaving.\n\nI intend that this conversation helps all of us to have more compassion and understanding for people who went through something similar like Diane, and learn what we can do to avoid falling victim to the psychological manipulation tactics of cult groups.\n\nDiane and I explored:\n- Why anyone can be vulnerable to cult influence\n- The subtle psychological tactics cults use (us vs. them, love bombing, charisma)\n- How loneliness, purpose, and community are often exploited\n- What leaving a cult does to your sense of identity\n- Why empathy \u2014 not judgment \u2014 is essential when talking about cult members\n- How modern technology, media, and disinformation use similar manipulation tactics today\n\nDiane offers rare insight into how belief systems take hold, how cognitive dissonance works, and why awareness and self-reflection are more important than ever in our current world.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in psychology, cult dynamics, spirituality, personal growth, autonomy, or critical thinking, this episode is for you!\n\n\u201COne person can make a lot of change.\u201D\n\n\uD83D\uDD14 Don\u2019t forget to like, comment \u0026 subscribe to watch more conversations like this!! \uD83D\uDC9E\n\nCheck out Diane\u0027s work and follow her on social media:\nWebsite: https://dianebenscoter.com/\nNonprofit Organisation: https://antidote.ngo/ \nDiane\u0027s Book: https://www.amazon.com/Shoes-Servant-Diane-Benscoter-ebook/dp/B00DRGAAHM\nDr. Sunita Sah\u0027s Book: https://www.amazon.com/Defy-Power-World-That-Demands-ebook/dp/B0D1QB4H8M/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1AGZNVDYI7265\u0026dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.AWNf6HfkkjKb7JEsAn-d29ZDCkx_FipQpYCfMlHxdmE.ge1Sapq8UgpdM30hpuav0XRCoYKIuEhu13-h5JoVGsI\u0026dib_tag=se\u0026keywords=defy\u002Bsunita\u0026qid=1763830350\u0026s=digital-text\u0026sprefix=defy\u002Bsunita%2Caps%2C268\u0026sr=1-1\nX: https://x.com/DBenscoter\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@ownyourbrain/\n\n\uD83D\uDC49 What part of this episode resonated with you the most?
