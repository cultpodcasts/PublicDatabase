After months of study, prayer, temple visits, and conversations with church leaders, we tried everything to stay faithful. But ultimately, we realized we couldn\u2019t continue raising our children in the church.

She delves into the challenges she faced, the strict rules she had to follow, and the emotional toll it took on her as a young woman\n\nIf you\u0027re curious about the FLDS community, the challenges they face, and the strength it takes to break free, make sure to subscribe to our channel for more inspiring stories of resilience and transformation.
