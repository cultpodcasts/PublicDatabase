      "description": "In this video, we react to Sister Wives Season 20 Tell-All Part 1 and break down two of the biggest moments from the episode.\n\nWe talk about the sale of Coyote Pass and how each person involved seems to remember the contracts and agreements very differently. The conflicting stories raise real questions about communication, accountability, and what actually happened behind the scenes.\n\nWe also discuss the uncomfortable moment when Kody says he \u201Cdid love\u201D Christine, and why that statement didn\u2019t sit well with Christine or David. Is that about lingering feelings, or is it simply a statement of past fact? We share our perspective on why wording matters \u2014 especially after everything that\u2019s happened.\n\nLet us know what you think:\nDo you believe the Coyote Pass stories add up, and was Kody\u2019s comment about loving Christine harmless or inappropriate?\n\nIf you or someone you love has left polygamy and needs assistance, please reach out to \u0022Holding Out HELP\u0022 at 801-548-3492 or visit their website at www.holdingouthelp.org\n\nAt Growing Up In Polygamy our mission is to \u0022Create compassion for communities that have been misunderstood, marginalized and/or abused by their leaders, and to empower those who have left by giving them a platform to share their stories with the world.\u0022\n\nIf you would like to DONATE to this cause you can do so here: https://donorbox.org/growing-up-in-polygamy\n\nInsta: @growingupinpolygamy\nNew website is now up! www.growingupinpolygamy.com\nTheme Song created by  @artcowles  \n\nPlease feel free to reach out to us!\ngrowingupinpolygamy@gmail.com\n\n\u2705SUBSCRIBE NOW : https://shorturl.at/inqrE\n\n\u27A1\uFE0F Checkout our other Videos:\n\uD83D\uDD37Ex-Polygamist Reacts to Sister Wives: Season 18 Ep. 1-2\n\u2705https://youtu.be/R9u4wAzUjK0\n\n\uD83D\uDD37Exclusive Interview with an Insider: Exposing FLDS Secrets\n\u2705https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIjlLejkETU\n\n\uD83D\uDD37Breaking Free: One Girl\u0027s Journey from Warren Jeffs\u0027 Control\n\u2705 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-bH4fLMZX0\n\n\uD83D\uDD37Behind FLDS Doors: The Tragic Tale of a Family Torn Apart by Warren Jeffs\n\u2705https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFFQ_j_RJCo\n\n\uD83D\uDD37Tour Of The Dream Center, A Refuge Home For Ex-Polygamous Families\n\u2705https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbqR1UJFJBY\n\n#like #comment #post #share and #encourage other to #subscribe to the channel.",

From years of emotional distance to unresolved power dynamics, this meeting says a lot about where their relationship truly stands.\n\nWe also dive into the idea of \u201Cbasement wives\u201D and how that label reflects deeper patterns of hierarchy, neglect, and worth inside polygamous marriages. On top of that, we talk about Janelle\u2019s desire for a spiritual release\u2014and why, in fundamentalist Mormonism, religious permission can feel just as important as emotional closure.\n\nAs former members of Mormon and Mormon fundamentalist communities, we share personal insight into how faith, control, and loyalty shape these conversations\u2014and why walking away isn\u2019t always as simple as it looks from the outside.\n\nLet us know your thoughts in the comments.

David pushes Kody to focus less on his own feelings and more on repairing relationships with his children, something Kody clearly isn\u2019t comfortable hearing. We also talk about what\u2019s next in Kody\u2019s ongoing \u201Capology tour,\u201D with Meri expected to be next, and why Janelle still feels she needs a spiritual release before she can truly move on. Drawing from our own experiences in fundamentalist Mormon belief systems, we break down why that release may still hold deep spiritual meaning for Janelle \u2014 even after everything she\u2019s been through.

Instead of owning the hurt he caused, Kody seems more interested in apologizing on his terms, in his timing, and in a way that centers his comfort rather than the women he hurt.\n\nWe also touch on Janelle\u2019s background and how she came to join Mormon fundamentalism, but only as context for how deeply these relationships were rooted for her.\n\n\uD83D\uDC49 Like, subscribe, and let us know what YOU think of Kody\u2019s apology tour.\n\n#SisterWives #SisterWivesReaction #SisterWivesSeason20 #KodyBrown #JanelleBrown #PluralMarriage #RealityTV\n\nIf you or someone you love has left polygamy and needs assistance, please reach out to \u0022Holding Out HELP\u0022 at 801-548-3492 or visit their website at www.holdingouthelp.org\n\nAt Growing Up In Polygamy our mission is to \u0022Create compassion for communities that have been misunderstood, marginalized and/or abused by their leaders, and to empower those who have left by giving them a platform to share their stories with the world.\u0022\n\nIf you would like to DONATE to this cause you can do so here: https://donorbox.org/growing-up-in-polygamy\n\nInsta: @growingupinpolygamy\nNew website is now up! www.growingupinpolygamy.com\nTheme Song created by  @artcowles  \n\nPlease feel free to reach out to us!\ngrowingupinpolygamy@gmail.com\n\n\u2705SUBSCRIBE NOW : https://shorturl.at/inqrE\n\n\u27A1\uFE0F Checkout our other Videos:\n\uD83D\uDD37Ex-Polygamist Reacts to Sister Wives: Season 18 Ep. 1-2\n\u2705https://youtu.be/R9u4wAzUjK0\n\n\uD83D\uDD37Exclusive Interview with an Insider: Exposing FLDS Secrets\n\u2705https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIjlLejkETU\n\n\uD83D\uDD37Breaking Free: One Girl\u0027s Journey from Warren Jeffs\u0027 Control\n\u2705 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-bH4fLMZX0\n\n\uD83D\uDD37Behind FLDS Doors: The Tragic Tale of a Family Torn Apart by Warren Jeffs\n\u2705https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFFQ_j_RJCo\n\n\uD83D\uDD37Tour Of The Dream Center, A Refuge Home For Ex-Polygamous Families\n\u2705https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbqR1UJFJBY\n\n#like #comment #post #share and #encourage other to #subscribe to the channel.",

And of course, Janelle\u2019s girls trip to New Orleans, where she finally lets her hair down and admits she needs a spiritual release from Kody before she can truly move on.\n\nBut the biggest question of the episode?

It brought back memories of Mormon church dances and wedding receptions, including our own, and how deeply those experiences reflect the culture we grew up in.\n\nWe also dive into how polygamy and Mormonism often frame jealousy and suffering as spiritual growth \u2014 that women are supposed to overcome jealousy to \u201Cbecome better,\u201D and that faith means learning to endure to the end. But what happens when \u201Cenduring\u201D starts to mean not living?\n\nJoin us as we react to Sister Wives Season 20, Episode 7 and talk about the deeper beliefs behind the culture \u2014 where joy is often postponed for a promised reward in the next life.\n\nIf you or someone you love has left polygamy and needs assistance, please reach out to \u0022Holding Out HELP\u0022 at 801-548-3492 or visit their website at www.holdingouthelp.org\n\nAt Growing Up In Polygamy our mission is to \u0022Create compassion for communities that have been misunderstood, marginalized and/or abused by their leaders, and to empower those who have left by giving them a platform to share their stories with the world.\u0022\n\nIf you would like to DONATE to this cause you can do so here: https://donorbox.org/growing-up-in-polygamy\n\nInsta: @growingupinpolygamy\nNew website is now up! www.growingupinpolygamy.com\nTheme Song created by  @artcowles  \n\nPlease feel free to reach out to us!\ngrowingupinpolygamy@gmail.com\n\n\u2705SUBSCRIBE NOW : https://shorturl.at/inqrE\n\n\u27A1\uFE0F Checkout our other Videos:\n\uD83D\uDD37Ex-Polygamist Reacts to Sister Wives: Season 18 Ep. 1-2\n\u2705https://youtu.be/R9u4wAzUjK0\n\n\uD83D\uDD37Exclusive Interview with an Insider: Exposing FLDS Secrets\n\u2705https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIjlLejkETU\n\n\uD83D\uDD37Breaking Free: One Girl\u0027s Journey from Warren Jeffs\u0027 Control\n\u2705 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-bH4fLMZX0\n\n\uD83D\uDD37Behind FLDS Doors: The Tragic Tale of a Family Torn Apart by Warren Jeffs\n\u2705https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFFQ_j_RJCo\n\n\uD83D\uDD37Tour Of The Dream Center, A Refuge Home For Ex-Polygamous Families\n\u2705https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbqR1UJFJBY\n\n#like #comment #post #share and #encourage other to #subscribe to the channel.",

After years of blaming his wives, this is a moment we didn\u2019t expect.We also talk about the possibility of future reconciliation and family reunions, and whether that\u2019s actually realistic based on everything we\u2019ve seen. Plus, the long-awaited sale of Coyote Pass is finally done\u2014though it sure didn\u2019t seem like a priority for Kody until it became something he wanted.And to top it all off, Kody and Robyn get an email from someone wanting to court the family. Robyn continues to say she is still open to plural marriage\u2026 but their actions tell a very different story.\u2705 Is the Brown family truly done?\u2705 Could there ever be a real reunion?\u2705 Is Robyn actually open to plural marriage\u2014or just saying the words?We break it all down from our perspective as former Mormon and former FLDS.Make sure to like, subscribe, and share your thoughts in the comments\u2014we love hearing from you!If you or someone you love has left polygamy and needs assistance, please reach out to \u0022Holding Out HELP\u0022 at 801-548-3492 or visit their website at www.holdingouthelp.orgAt Growing Up In Polygamy our mission is to \u0022Create compassion for communities that have been misunderstood, marginalized and/or abused by their leaders, and to empower those who have left by giving them a platform to share their stories with the world.\u0022If you would like to DONATE to this cause you can do so here: https://donorbox.org/growing-up-in-polygamyInsta: @growingupinpolygamyNew website is now up! www.growingupinpolygamy.comTheme Song created by @artcowles Please feel free to reach out to us!growingupinpolygamy@gmail.com",

As control tightened, the group began attacking other Amish men and women, forcibly cutting off their sacred hair and beards\u2014a deep act of humiliation in Amish culture. The leader even took photos of the attacks, which ultimately helped land him in prison. This story is told by his former right-hand man, who bravely left the group\u2014but is still shunned by his family to this day. Different group.

He admits that he truly did love his wives \u2014 and that their leaving shattered his ego and confidence.\n\nIn today\u2019s video, we react to Kody\u2019s confession, where he shares that his sense of self-worth was built on constant validation from his large family. Now, after even pushing Robyn away, he claims he\u2019s finally in a place where he can be happy in a monogamous relationship.\n\nIs this true growth... or just Kody rewriting the story to protect his pride? We dive deep into the emotional fallout, the power struggles, and what this means for the Brown family moving forward.\n\n\uD83D\uDC49 Don\u2019t forget to like, subscribe, and hit the bell so you don\u2019t miss our next breakdown of Sister Wives!\n\n#SisterWives #KodyBrown #SisterWivesReaction #TLC\n\nChapters:\n00:00:00 Cody\u0027s Struggle with Monogamy and Family Dynamics  \n00:03:06 Communication Breakdown in Divorce Proceedings\n00:06:03 Challenges of Celebrating Valentine\u0027s Day in Polygamous Families\n00:09:00 Navigating Plural Marriage in LDS Belief\n00:12:20 Valentine\u0027s Day with Cody and Robin\n00:14:59 Mary\u0027s Spiritual Release and Breaking Free from Cody\n00:17:53 Debate on Marriage: Cult or Commitment?\n00:21:02 Cody Confesses: The Truth Behind His Angry Words\n00:24:07 Cody and Robin\u0027s Marital Struggles\n00:27:24 Farewell and Thanks for Joining Sister Wives Journey\n\nJoin our NEW Patreon HERE: https://patreon.com/growingupinpolygamy\n\nIf you or someone you love has left polygamy and needs assistance, please reach out to \u0022Holding Out HELP\u0022 at 801-548-3492 or visit their website at www.holdingouthelp.org\n\nAt Growing Up In Polygamy our mission is to \u0022Create compassion for communities that have been misunderstood, marginalized and/or abused by their leaders, and to empower those who have left by giving them a platform to share their stories with the world.\u0022\n\nIf you would like to DONATE to this cause you can do so here: https://donorbox.org/growing-up-in-polygamy\n\nInsta: @growingupinpolygamy\nNew website is now up! www.growingupinpolygamy.com\nTheme Song created by  @artcowles  \n\nPlease feel free to reach out to us!\ngrowingupinpolygamy@gmail.com\n\n\u2705SUBSCRIBE NOW : https://shorturl.at/inqrE\n\n#like #comment #post #share and #encourage other to #subscribe to the channel.",

While the show is historical fiction, it clearly portrays Brigham Young and early Mormon leaders as religious extremists willing to do anything\u2014massacres included\u2014to preserve their theocracy. The show brings to light some of the darkest chapters in Mormon history, including the infamous Mountain Meadows Massacre, where men, women, and children were slaughtered under the guise of religious loyalty. But how much of this portrayal is based on real history?
