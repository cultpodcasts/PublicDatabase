      "description": "In this interview, we sit down with Emily Lee, the daughter of the current prophet of the AUB (Apostolic United Brethren) church. Emily shares what it was like growing up in a polygamist household, how her father\u2019s leadership affected their family, and why she made the difficult decision to leave the church as a teenager.\n\nShe also reflects on her concerns for the future of the AUB, especially as she sees similarities between her brother and Warren Jeffs. Emily shares her personal perspective on what it\u2019s like to grow up in a high-demand religious group and how those early experiences still impact her today.\n\nThis conversation offers an honest and personal look into life inside the AUB and what it means to step away from it.\n\n#AUB #Polygamy #EmilyLee #ExFundamentalist #FaithJourney #MormonFundamentalism #LeavingPolygamy #CultRecovery #FLDS\n\nIf you or someone you love has left polygamy and needs assistance, please reach out to \u0022Holding Out HELP\u0022 at 801-548-3492 or visit their website at www.holdingouthelp.org\n\nAt Growing Up In Polygamy our mission is to \u0022Create compassion for communities that have been misunderstood, marginalized and/or abused by their leaders, and to empower those who have left by giving them a platform to share their stories with the world.\u0022\n\nIf you would like to DONATE to this cause you can do so here: https://donorbox.org/growing-up-in-polygamy\n\nInsta: @growingupinpolygamy\nNew website is now up! www.growingupinpolygamy.com\nTheme Song created by  @artcowles  \n\nPlease feel free to reach out to us!\ngrowingupinpolygamy@gmail.com\n\n\u2705SUBSCRIBE NOW : https://shorturl.at/inqrE\n\n\u27A1\uFE0F Checkout our other Videos:\n\uD83D\uDD37Ex-Polygamist Reacts to Sister Wives: Season 18 Ep. 1-2\n\u2705https://youtu.be/R9u4wAzUjK0\n\n\uD83D\uDD37Exclusive Interview with an Insider: Exposing FLDS Secrets\n\u2705https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIjlLejkETU\n\n\uD83D\uDD37Breaking Free: One Girl\u0027s Journey from Warren Jeffs\u0027 Control\n\u2705 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-bH4fLMZX0\n\n\uD83D\uDD37Behind FLDS Doors: The Tragic Tale of a Family Torn Apart by Warren Jeffs\n\u2705https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFFQ_j_RJCo\n\n\uD83D\uDD37Tour Of The Dream Center, A Refuge Home For Ex-Polygamous Families\n\u2705https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbqR1UJFJBY\n\n#like #comment #post #share and #encourage other to #subscribe to the channel.",

As control tightened, the group began attacking other Amish men and women, forcibly cutting off their sacred hair and beards\u2014a deep act of humiliation in Amish culture. The leader even took photos of the attacks, which ultimately helped land him in prison. This story is told by his former right-hand man, who bravely left the group\u2014but is still shunned by his family to this day. Different group.

      "description": "In this episode, we dive into another story from How I Escaped My Cult \u2014 this time focusing on NXIVM, a group that didn\u2019t claim to be religious, but promised personal growth and empowerment. We break down how NXIVM used the language of self-improvement to lure people in, and how, despite the different promises, the control, manipulation, and abuse were alarmingly similar to what we\u2019ve seen in religious cults. Join us as we talk about the red flags, the psychological tactics, and why no one is ever \u0022too smart\u0022 or \u0022too strong\u0022 to be targeted by a high-control group.

This is a powerful example of how cult tactics don\u0027t always require thousands of followers\u2014sometimes, it\u0027s just one family suffering in silence. We break down how abuse, isolation, and twisted faith can be used to dominate and destroy lives\u2014and how true bravery is found in those who choose to leave. If you\u0027ve ever wondered how cults form behind closed doors, this one hits hard. \u0026#x1f449; Don\u2019t forget to like, subscribe, and share if this message resonates with you. #CultSurvivor #PilgrimFamily #SpiritualAbuse #HowIEscapedMyCult #FamilyCults #ReligiousTrauma #CultsExposed #ExFundie #FaithManipulation #SamAndMelissa #CultReaction #SpiritualManipulation #ReligiousControl #FreedomFromCults #BraveSurvivors Chapters: 00:00:00 Escaping a Family Cult: The Pilgrim Family Story 00:02:58 The Rise and Fall of Papa Pilgrim\u0027s Cult 00:06:08 Psychological Manipulation and Isolation 00:09:25 Manipulation and Abuse in Isolated Families 00:12:57 The Tragic Role of Mothers in Facilitating Abuse 00:17:01 Surviving Abuse: A Story of Courage and Resilience 00:19:33 Fear and Family: The Decision to Stay 00:22:35 The Escape and Shelter by a Christian Family 00:25:39 Overcoming Cults: The Power of Self-Liberation Alishaba\u0027s Book: https://amzn.to/4joQUc5 Join our NEW Patreon HERE: https://patreon.com/growingupinpolygamy If you or someone you love has left polygamy and needs assistance, please reach out to \u0022Holding Out HELP\u0022 at 801-548-3492 or visit their website at www.holdingouthelp.org At Growing Up In Polygamy our mission is to \u0022Create compassion for communities that have been misunderstood, marginalized and/or abused by their leaders, and to empower those who have left by giving them a platform to share their stories with the world.\u0022 If you would like to DONATE to this cause you can do so here: https://donorbox.org/growing-up-in-polygamy Insta: @growingupinpolygamy New website is now up! www.growingupinpolygamy.com Theme Song created by @artcowles Please feel free to reach out to us! growingupinpolygamy@gmail.com \u2705SUBSCRIBE NOW : https://shorturl.at/inqrE #like #comment #post #share and #encourage other to #subscribe to the channel.",

Jaden shares how these messages became too much to bear, the impact they had on his mother and siblings, and why they ultimately led him to leave the FLDS and escape his father\u0027s control.

In this exclusive interview, Jaden Jeffs shares his firsthand experience of life inside the inner circle of the FLDS church. From living in the prophet\u2019s home alongside his 80 wives to moving between secret compounds in Texas and other states, Jaden reveals what life was really like behind closed doors. He offers rare insights into the power, control, and fear that shaped his childhood under one of the most notorious religious leaders in modern history.

While the show is historical fiction, it clearly portrays Brigham Young and early Mormon leaders as religious extremists willing to do anything\u2014massacres included\u2014to preserve their theocracy. The show brings to light some of the darkest chapters in Mormon history, including the infamous Mountain Meadows Massacre, where men, women, and children were slaughtered under the guise of religious loyalty.

She delves into the challenges she faced, the strict rules she had to follow, and the emotional toll it took on her as a young woman\n\nIf you\u0027re curious about the FLDS community, the challenges they face, and the strength it takes to break free, make sure to subscribe to our channel for more inspiring stories of resilience and transformation.
