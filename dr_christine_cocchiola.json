      "title": "The Psychology of Coercive Control: Cognitive Dissonance and Trauma Bonds Explained",
      "description": "In this episode of Perfect Prey: A Coercive Control Podcast, Dr. Christine Cocchiola sits down with Dr. Peter Salerno to take a deeper look at the hidden dynamics of coercive control and the psychological abuse that entraps partners and children in cycles of fear, confusion, and dependency. We explore the defining traits of coercive controllers, how they manipulate both adult and child victims, and why survivors often struggle with cognitive dissonance, a mental conflict that can keep them tethered to abusive relationships long after the harm is clear. Together, we discuss the traumatic impact of cognitive dissonance, how abusers condition children to adopt distorted beliefs, and what protective strategies parents can use to safeguard their children\u2019s well-being. You\u2019ll also hear about the crucial role of trauma-informed therapy, ways to respond intentionally to children\u2019s conditioned behaviors, and how survivors can begin to break free from the psychological grip of coercive control. This conversation sheds light on the complex psychological dynamics of abuse and offers practical steps for supporting both adults and children who have been targeted by coercive controllers. If you\u2019ve ever felt trapped in a relationship that left you doubting your own reality, or if you\u2019re working to protect children from ongoing manipulation, this episode will give you clarity, tools, and hope for the path forward.

      "description": "In this episode of Perfect Prey, I sit down with filmmaker and NXIVM Whistleblower, Mark Vicente, to explore the insidious nature of narcissism and coercive control. Known for his role in exposing the NXIVM cult and for his upcoming documentary Narcissist Playbook, Mark brings a rare blend of lived experience and narrative insight to a conversation that is both deeply personal and profoundly educational. Together, we examine how narcissistic abuse thrives on confusion, manipulation, and silence. Coercive control isn\u0027t always visible\u2014often it hides in plain sight, eroding a survivor\u2019s sense of self through emotional, psychological, and sometimes spiritual abuse. Mark shares how he came to recognize the patterns of power and control he endured, and why storytelling and awareness are key to dismantling these dynamics. As a licensed clinical social worker and survivor of coercive control myself, this conversation is one I know will resonate. We talk about the trauma of emotional abuse, the grooming tactics abusers use to gain and maintain control, and the long road to healing after escaping these toxic dynamics. Mark\u2019s courage and clarity offer validation to those still trying to make sense of what happened to them, and hope to those who are just beginning to find their voice. This is more than a podcast episode\u2026 it\u2019s a call to awareness, to healing, and to action. Tune in to better understand the trauma of coercive control and narcissistic relationships, and to remember that your truth is the first step toward freedom.
