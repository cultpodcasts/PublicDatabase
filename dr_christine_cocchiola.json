      "title": "The Weaponization of Children in Coercive Control",
      "description": "In this solo episode of Perfect Prey, I explore one of the most heartbreaking dynamics of coercive control: the weaponization of children.\n\nChildren rely on their parents for safety, stability, and unconditional love. But when a predatory parent is operating within the family system, attachment can become fractured. Instead of growing up with secure connection, children are often indoctrinated into false narratives, exposed to subtle undermining, and pulled into loyalty binds they cannot cognitively or emotionally process.\n\nI explain how coercive control is the underpinning of all forms of abuse \u2014 psychological, legal, financial, physical, and emotional \u2014 and how, when an abuser can no longer control their partner, they often shift to controlling through the child.\n\nWe\u2019ll talk about:\n\nHow attachment is formed \u2014 and how it can be fractured\n\nWhy children may come home dysregulated, angry, or oppositional\n\nHow subtle undermining and false narratives are planted\n\nThe difference between alienation rhetoric and attachment fracture\n\nWhy predatory parents rely on retaliation and loyalty conflicts\n\nHow protective parents can create \u201Croadblocks\u201D to manipulation\n\nWhat it means to respond instead of react \u2014 even when you are traumatized\n\nThis episode is especially for protective parents navigating post-separation abuse and family court dynamics. The reality is painful: children are often placed in impossible positions, forced into emotional roles they should never have to carry.\n\nBut there are ways to respond differently.\n\nIf you are watching your child struggle, unravel, or lash out after time with the other parent, this episode will help you understand what may be happening beneath the surface \u2014 and how to stay grounded in your role as the secure base.\n\nProtective parents are doing some of the hardest work there is.

      "description": "In this episode, Dr. Christine Cocchiola discusses something many survivors quietly experience:\n\nBeing told \u2014 sometimes even in therapy \u2014 that if they just changed a little more, tried a little harder, or accommodated a little better\u2026 the relationship might improve.\n\nWhen coercive control is present, that advice can be deeply harmful.\n\n\u2728 In this video, Dr. Christine explores:\n\nTrauma bonding and intermittent reinforcement\n\n\u201CShapeshifting\u201D to accommodate an abusive partner\n\nHow therapy can inadvertently reinforce subjugation\n\nWhy recognizing patterns creates empowerment\n\nThe power of boundaries \u2014 even when escape is complex\n\nHow protective parents become the light guiding their children toward clarity\n\nWhen you begin to see the pattern, there is power in that awareness.\nWhether you choose to stay, set boundaries, or prepare to leave \u2014 clarity is different than confusion.\n\nAnd for protective parents: your children are watching.\nWhen you reclaim your agency, they see what freedom looks like.\n\n\uD83D\uDC99 There is no judgment here.

      "description": "In this episode, Dr. Christine Cocchiola speaks directly to both therapists and survivors about a difficult but critical truth:\n\nCouples therapy can be dangerous when coercive control is present.\n\nWhen there is a pattern of power over, inequity, and manipulation, attempting to \u201Cbring the couple together\u201D can unintentionally:\n\nEmpower and embolden the abuser\n\nGive false hope to the victim\n\nKeep someone trapped in a harmful dynamic\n\nReinforce manipulation inside the therapy room\n\nDr. Christine shares her own experience of having a therapist name the abuse \u2014 and how that truth became a thread she returned to over and over again.\n\n\u2728 If you are a therapist, this is a call to discern patterns of coercive control and recognize when reconciliation is not the goal \u2014 safety is.\n\u2728 If you are a survivor, this is your reminder to listen to your body. Patterns matter. Your intuition matters.\n\nIf you are a professional and want to deepen your understanding, Dr. C offers a comprehensive Coercive Control Professionals Training (12 CEs) designed to equip clinicians with the tools needed to navigate these complex dynamics.\n\n\uD83D\uDC99 You are not alone.

      "description": "In this episode of Perfect Prey, I\u2019m joined by Laura Richards, a criminal behavioral analyst, former New Scotland Yard specialist, and one of the leading global voices on coercive control. Laura has been instrumental in changing laws on stalking and coercive control in the UK and internationally, and her work has helped shape policy, legislation, and professional practice worldwide.\n\nWe explore why coercive control is not about isolated incidents, but a patterned strategy of domination, entrapment, and power imbalance. Laura explains why coercive control is best understood as a war of attrition, how patriarchy and misogyny shape institutional responses, and why women and children are so often disbelieved\u2014even when the evidence is present.\n\nThis conversation examines how legal systems, family courts, and law enforcement frequently fail victims and survivors, particularly at the point of separation, when risk escalates most dramatically. We also discuss why coercive control must be criminalized, why gender matters in risk assessment, and how language itself can either obscure or reveal abuse.\n\nWhat we cover\nWhat coercive control really is and why it\u2019s a patterned form of abuse\nWhy victims and survivors are often disbelieved by systems meant to protect them\nCoercive control as \u201Cmurders and suicides in slow motion\u201D\nThe role of patriarchy, entitlement, and power imbalance in abuse\nWhy separation is the most dangerous time for women and children\nHow family courts can become a tool of post-separation abuse\nWhy protecting children requires protecting the non-abusive parent\nThe urgent need to criminalize coercive control globally\n\nWhy listen\nIf you are a survivor, protective parent, clinician, attorney, advocate, or policymaker, this episode offers critical insight into how coercive control operates beneath the surface of relationships and systems. Laura Richards brings clarity to why abuse is so often minimized, misunderstood, or reframed\u2014and what must change to prevent further harm.\n\nGuest bio (short)\nLaura Richards is a criminal behavioral analyst, former New Scotland Yard specialist, and a leading international expert on coercive control, stalking, and violence against women. She helped create the DASH risk assessment model, founded the National Stalking Advocacy Service (Paladin), and played a central role in criminalizing coercive control in England and Wales.

      "description": "In this episode, Dr. Christine Cocchiola, licensed clinical social worker and long-time advocate for protective parents, continues the conversation about collusion within the family court system.\n\nWhile not every professional lacks integrity, the reality is that too many systems benefit from prolonged conflict. As Dr. Christine explains, enormous amounts of money are generated through divorce, custody, and post-separation litigation\u2014creating what many now call the divorce industrial complex.\n\nThese are not \u201Chigh conflict\u201D cases.\nThey are power-and-control cases.\n\n\u2728 In this video, Dr. Christine discusses:\n\nWhy family court is not immune to systemic harm\n\nHow money often equals power in custody disputes\n\nThe use of vexatious litigation as retaliation\n\nWhy coercive control continues post-separation\n\nWhy these dynamics are happening everywhere\u2014not just in one state or country\n\nWhy these stories must be told for young people and future families\n\nThis is why Dr. Christine helped bring forward Framed: Women in the Family Court Underworld, a collection of 22 real stories from protective mothers around the world who experienced coercive control and systemic harm.\n\nDr. Christine also acknowledges protective fathers and shares that support spaces for protective dads exist, because this harm is not limited to one gender.\n\n\uD83D\uDC99 You have more influence than you realize.\nYou can help your children heal.\n\n\uD83C\uDF3F Join Dr. C\u2019s Community for education, validation, and support:\n\uD83D\uDC49 https://go.drcocchiola.com/innercirclecommunity\n\n#DrChristineCocchiola\n#FamilyCourtAbuse\n#DivorceIndustrialComplex\n#CoerciveControl\n#ProtectiveParents\n#VexatiousLitigation\n#SystemicAbuse\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Follow Dr. Christine on IG: www.instagram.com/dr.cocchiola_coercivecontrol\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Visit her website: https://coercivecontrolconsulting.com \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Become a Certified Trauma-Informed Protective Parent in this intensive educational program with an option for LIVE coaching/support to guide protective parents as they navigate the stormy seas of parenting a child who has been coercively controlled. \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Sign up here: https://go.drcocchiola.com/accelerated2-selfstudy",

      "description": "In this video, Dr. Christine Cocchiola, licensed clinical social worker and long-time advocate for protective parents, addresses one of the most misunderstood and damaging narratives in the family court system: the myth of \u201Chigh conflict divorce.\u201D\n\nWhat is often labeled as \u201Chigh conflict\u201D is, in reality, a power-over dynamic\u2014where one parent systematically coerces, controls, and retaliates against the other. Over time, survivors may appear reactive, dysregulated, or adversarial, not because this reflects who they are, but because anyone trapped long enough will eventually push back.\n\nDr. Christine explains why protective parents\u2014particularly protective mothers\u2014are so often framed, disbelieved, and pathologized in family court, while perpetrators with a pattern of coercive control are overlooked or even rewarded.\n\n\u2728 In this episode, Dr. Christine discusses:\n\nWhy \u201Chigh conflict\u201D is a misleading label\n\nHow power and control show up in family court\n\nWhy survivors are often not believed\n\nHow victims behave outside abusive dynamics\n\nThe role of retaliation and vexatious litigation\n\nThe divorce industrial complex and systemic harm\n\nWhy character patterns\u2014not reactions\u2014matter\n\nThis work is deeply personal and deeply professional.

      "description": "In today\u2019s video, Dr. Christine Cocchiola explains why children \u2014 and even adults \u2014 can seem to \u201Cflip on a dime\u201D back toward an abusive parent after gaining clarity.\n\nThis shift is not confusion or weakness. It is the result of intermittent reinforcement, the same tactic that once kept you stuck. A small moment of kindness, charm, or calm can cause the nervous system to lower its guard \u2014 and abusers know exactly when and how to do this.\n\nDr. Christine also discusses why family court becomes a stage for retaliation. These individuals are not simply \u201Chigh conflict\u201D \u2014 they are drawn to conflict. They are adversarial, inflexible, and energized by power struggles. Their goal is not resolution. Their goal is punishment.\n\n\u2728 In this episode, Dr. Christine discusses:\n\nWhy children can revert after gaining clarity\n\nHow intermittent reinforcement works in abusive dynamics\n\nWhy abusers retaliate when exposed\n\nHow systems are often manipulated to continue abuse\n\nWhy family court is especially dangerous\n\nThe difference between conflict and antagonism\n\nThe 3 Ps for survival: Predict, Prepare, Protect\n\nDr. Christine emphasizes the importance of seeing the freight train coming.

      "description": "In today\u2019s video, Dr. Christine Cocchiola speaks directly to protective parents who are struggling to recognize their child beneath aggressive, dismissive, or heartbreaking behavior.\n\nChildren raised in coercively controlling family systems become entangled in the abuser\u2019s web. The behaviors protective parents see \u2014 aggression, withdrawal, hostility \u2014 are often not expressions of who the child truly is, but survival responses shaped by coercion, fear, and control.\n\nDr. Christine clarifies an important distinction:\nMost children are not fully indoctrinated against their protective parent. Many are acquiescing, some are aligning, and some temporarily identify with the aggressor. True estrangement is far rarer than most people believe.\n\nShe shares a powerful story of a protective mother who was forced to let go after systems failed \u2014 and how years later, her child returned, ready to reconnect once the control loosened.\n\n\u2728 In this episode, Dr. Christine discusses:\n\nWhy behavior under coercive control is not the child\u2019s true self\n\nThe difference between estrangement, acquiescence, and alignment\n\nHow identifying with the aggressor is a survival response\n\nWhy shame only deepens harm\n\nThe power of saying: \u201CThat wasn\u2019t your fault. That wasn\u2019t my fault.\u201D\n\nHow steadiness, understanding, and patience create space for reconnection\n\nDr. Christine reminds protective parents: your child is still there.

      "description": "In today\u2019s video, Dr. Christine Cocchiola breaks down what coercive control actually is \u2014 and why so many victims don\u2019t recognize it while they\u2019re living inside it.\n\nHistorically, abuse has been understood through a violent incident model, focusing on physical harm. But coercive control is a non-physical violence model, rooted in power and control. It slowly and insidiously erodes autonomy, voice, and a person\u2019s ability to be themselves.\n\nDr. Christine explains how coercive controllers often seek out people who are:\n\nAccommodating\n\nOptimistic\n\nRelationship-oriented\n\nWilling to work hard to make things \u201Cbetter\u201D\n\nBecause coercive control is nuanced, many survivors look back only later and recognize the signs \u2014 gaslighting, mockery, intimidation, isolation, threats, and consequences for simply expressing feelings or disagreement.\n\n\u2728 In this episode, Dr. Christine discusses:\n\nWhy abuse is about power and control, not just violence\n\nHow coercive control can exist without physical harm\n\nCommon tactics like mockery, minimization, and revenge\n\nWhy family court often becomes a stage for coercive controllers\n\nHow victims lose personal power over time\n\nWhy children are not just witnesses \u2014 but victims\n\nHow children learn to regulate themselves through fear and appeasement\n\nDr. Christine emphasizes that coercive control within the family system is child abuse, even when no physical violence is present. Children learn to walk on eggshells just as the adult victim does \u2014 and that harm is often unacknowledged by systems.\n\n\uD83D\uDC99 If this resonates, please subscribe and share.\nNaming coercive control is a critical step toward clarity and healing.\n\n\uD83C\uDF3F Join Dr. C\u2019s Community for education, validation, and support:\nhttps://go.drcocchiola.com/innercirclecommunity\n\n#DrChristineCocchiola\n#CoerciveControl\n#PsychologicalAbuse\n#NonPhysicalAbuse\n#ProtectiveParenting\n#UnacknowledgedChildAbuse\n#PowerAndControl\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Follow Dr. Christine on IG: www.instagram.com/dr.cocchiola_coercivecontrol\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Visit her website: https://coercivecontrolconsulting.com \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Become a Certified Trauma-Informed Protective Parent in this intensive educational program with an option for LIVE coaching/support to guide protective parents as they navigate the stormy seas of parenting a child who has been coercively controlled. \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Sign up here: https://go.drcocchiola.com/accelerated2-selfstudy",

      "description": "In this episode of Perfect Prey, I\u2019m joined by Andrew Carpenter, a solicitor and partner at Webster Lawyers in Australia, widely known for his work holding child sexual abuse perpetrators accountable and advocating for systemic reform.\n\nAndrew and I have a frank, uncomfortable, and deeply necessary conversation about child sexual abuse, grooming, coercive control, and the institutional failures that continue to endanger children. We explore how child predators use the same grooming tactics as coercive controllers, how technology and AI have dramatically increased access to abuse material, and why legal systems\u2014including family courts\u2014so often fail to protect children and the parents trying to keep them safe.\n\nThis episode centers the reality that child sexual abuse is not rare, not accidental, and not a crime of opportunity\u2014it is intentional, patterned, and enabled by silence, disbelief, and systemic blind spots.\n\nWhat we cover\nHow child sexual abuse perpetrators groom children, families, and institutions\nWhy all child predators use coercive control and relational grooming tactics\nThe disturbing accessibility of child abuse material online\nHow technology, AI, and social media are being weaponized against children\nWhy most abuse occurs within trusted relationships and family systems\nThe failures of criminal courts and family courts to protect child victims\nWhy lack of physical evidence does not mean abuse did not occur\nWarning signs, behavioral red flags, and changes parents should not ignore\nHow shame, fear, and silence protect perpetrators\u2014not children\nWhat meaningful prevention, accountability, and reform must address\n\nWhy listen\nIf you are a survivor, protective parent, clinician, attorney, educator, or advocate, this episode provides critical insight into how child sexual abuse actually operates\u2014and why so many children are disbelieved, retraumatized, or returned to unsafe environments. Andrew\u2019s work exposes how deeply embedded these harms are within systems that claim to protect children, and why uncomfortable conversations are essential to change.\n\nGuest bio (short)\nAndrew Carpenter is a solicitor and partner at Webster Lawyers in Australia, specializing in child sexual abuse litigation and survivor advocacy. He is widely recognized for challenging institutional failures, advocating for legal reform, and amplifying survivor voices in cases where children have been silenced or ignored.

      "description": "In today\u2019s video, Dr. Christine Cocchiola continues the conversation on trauma bonding in children by focusing on dissociation and cognitive dissonance \u2014 two powerful survival responses that help children cope with being forced into unsafe relationships.\n\nChildren living under coercive control are often required by systems to continue contact with an abusive parent. Faced with the unbearable reality that a caregiver is harmful \u2014 while still needing to survive visits \u2014 the brain adapts. Dissociation becomes a way to reduce pain, and over time, permissive and neglectful parenting can reinforce this process.\n\nDr. Christine explains how:\n\nDissociation helps children survive overwhelming pain\n\nCognitive dissonance makes harm feel \u201Cnormal\u201D\n\nPermissiveness and neglect deepen trauma bonds\n\nGaslighting can turn inward, leading children to doubt their own reality\n\nTrauma bonds are neurologically reinforced over time\n\nShe also speaks to the grief and loss protective parents carry \u2014 the grief of recognizing how deeply children have been harmed and how profoundly unfair this reality is.

      "description": "In today\u2019s video, Dr. Christine Cocchiola talks about one of the most painful and confusing realities for protective parents: children becoming trauma bonded to an abusive parent.\n\nTrauma bonding in children looks different than it does in adult relationships. The abusive person is not a partner \u2014 it is their caretaker. Attachment to a parent is biologically driven and designed for survival, which makes trauma bonds with caregivers especially powerful and difficult to break.\n\nDr. Christine explains how children often live in a dissociated state, forgetting or minimizing the harm they experienced \u2014 even when they heard violence, felt fear in their bodies, or lived in constant instability. This forgetting is not denial; it is the brain\u2019s survival strategy.\n\n\u2728 In this episode, Dr. Christine discusses:\n\nWhy attachment to a caregiver is biologically reinforced\n\nHow trauma bonding helps children survive unsafe environments\n\nWhy children dissociate from painful memories\n\nHow coercive control shapes a child\u2019s beliefs about the safe parent\n\nWhy power \u2014 not love \u2014 keeps children tied to the abuser\n\nWhy children forgive at high rates even after recognizing abuse\n\nDr. Christine reminds protective parents that this process mirrors what many adult victims experience \u2014 only stronger \u2014 and that patience, understanding, and a coercive-control lens are essential when supporting children through this.\n\nShe also shares that future videos will continue exploring trauma bonding, cognitive dissonance, and why recognition of abuse does not automatically break attachment.\n\n\uD83D\uDC99 If this resonates, please subscribe and share.\nYour child\u2019s attachment responses make sense \u2014 and so does your grief.\n\n\uD83C\uDF3F Join Dr. C\u2019s Community for education, validation, and support:\nhttps://go.drcocchiola.com/innercirclecommunity\n\n#DrChristineCocchiola\n#TraumaBond\n#CoerciveControl\n#ProtectiveParenting\n#ChildhoodTrauma\n#AttachmentTrauma\n#PostSeparationAbuse\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Follow Dr. Christine on IG: www.instagram.com/dr.cocchiola_coercivecontrol\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Visit her website: https://coercivecontrolconsulting.com \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Become a Certified Trauma-Informed Protective Parent in this intensive educational program with an option for LIVE coaching/support to guide protective parents as they navigate the stormy seas of parenting a child who has been coercively controlled. \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Sign up here: https://go.drcocchiola.com/accelerated2-selfstudy",

Grooming is not sudden or obvious. It is calculated, relational, and often carried out by adults children know, trust, or even love.\n\nShe also addresses an important truth: children are never responsible for protecting themselves. Adults must be held accountable. And yet, we live in a world where systems often fail, predators are not always stopped, and parents are left navigating real risk without support.\n\nThis is why Dr. Christine discusses how to give children a developmentally appropriate safety toolbox \u2014 not to place responsibility on them, but to help them retain voice, body awareness, and agency when something feels off.\n\n\u2728 In this episode, Dr. Christine discusses:\n\nWhy grooming is a form of coercive control\n\nHow predators select and groom children\n\nWhy abuse often doesn\u2019t \u201Cfeel scary\u201D to a child\n\nThe importance of teaching children there are no secrets\n\nWhy children must know they will always be believed\n\nHow to talk about body safety using clear, correct language\n\nWhy intuition and body signals matter\n\nThe reality that even informed children can still be harmed \u2014 and why that is never their fault\n\nDr. Christine also invites viewers to explore her podcast, Perfect Prey, where adult and child victims share their lived experiences of coercive control, grooming, and survival.\n\n\uD83D\uDC99 If this video is helpful, please subscribe and share.\nKnowledge is power \u2014 and silence protects no one.\n\n\uD83C\uDF3F Join Dr. C\u2019s Community for education and support:\nhttps://go.drcocchiola.com/innercirclecommunity\n\n#DrChristineCocchiola\n#ChildSafety\n#Grooming\n#CoerciveControl\n#ProtectiveParenting\n#ChildSexualAbusePrevention\n#TraumaInformedParenting\n#BodySafety\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Follow Dr. Christine on IG: www.instagram.com/dr.cocchiola_coercivecontrol\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Visit her website: https://coercivecontrolconsulting.com \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Become a Certified Trauma-Informed Protective Parent in this intensive educational program with an option for LIVE coaching/support to guide protective parents as they navigate the stormy seas of parenting a child who has been coercively controlled. \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Sign up here: https://go.drcocchiola.com/accelerated2-selfstudy",

From permissive and neglectful parenting to the misuse of technology and lack of structure, abusers often compromise a child\u2019s developing brain \u2014 not for the child\u2019s benefit, but to harm the adult victim.\n\nChildren may appear to prefer the abusive parent because that environment offers unlimited freedom without responsibility. When the protective parent provides structure, safety, and boundaries, they are often met with resistance \u2014 not because they are doing something wrong, but because the child has been harmed.\n\n\u2728 In this episode, Dr. Christine discusses:\n\nWhy abusers weaponize children from day one\n\nHow permissive and neglectful parenting is used as a control tactic\n\nWhy children lose agency and autonomy under coercive control\n\nWhy your expectations must change when parenting abused children\n\nThe importance of connecting instead of correcting\n\nWhy radical acceptance is essential for survival and healing\n\nWhy this is unacknowledged child abuse\n\nDr. Christine also shares why she created the Protective Parenting Program \u2014 to bring clinical expertise directly into the homes of parents who are not being supported by systems \u2014 and why building a sea of allies through professional training is critical to protecting children.\n\n\uD83D\uDC99 If this resonates, please subscribe and share.\nYou are doing the hardest work there is \u2014 and you are not alone.\n\n\uD83C\uDF3F Join Dr. C\u2019s Community for support and connection:\nhttps://go.drcocchiola.com/innercirclecommunity\n\n#DrChristineCocchiola\n#ProtectiveParenting\n#CoerciveControl\n#WeaponizedChildren\n#PostSeparationAbuse\n#NarcissisticAbuse\n#UnacknowledgedChildAbuse\n#TraumaInformedParenting\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Follow Dr. Christine on IG: www.instagram.com/dr.cocchiola_coercivecontrol\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Visit her website: https://coercivecontrolconsulting.com \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Become a Certified Trauma-Informed Protective Parent in this intensive educational program with an option for LIVE coaching/support to guide protective parents as they navigate the stormy seas of parenting a child who has been coercively controlled. \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Sign up here: https://go.drcocchiola.com/accelerated2-selfstudy",

      "description": "In today\u2019s video, Dr. Christine Cocchiola explains why love bombing and grooming are central features of coercive control\u2014and why abuse is so often invisible to the outside world.\n\nIn the UK, love bombing is formally recognized as part of coercive control. Abusers groom their victims, their children, and entire communities over time. They do not announce themselves as dangerous. Many are charismatic, admired, and seen as \u201Cgreat parents\u201D or \u201Cgreat partners,\u201D which makes the abuse nearly impossible for others to believe.\n\nDr. Christine shares how coercive control often intensifies after separation, why leaving does not automatically make victims safer, and how abusers escalate once they feel they are losing control. This dynamic plays out repeatedly in family court, where false narratives are reinforced and protective parents are often dismissed.\n\n\u2728 In this episode, Dr. Christine discusses:\n\nWhy love bombing is a grooming tactic\n\nHow abusers hide rage beneath charm\n\nWhy abuse escalates after separation\n\nWhy victims are often not believed\n\nHow grooming impacts children and extended family\n\nThe difference between personal power and power over\n\nWhy community is essential for survival and healing\n\nDr. Christine reminds viewers: you are not crazy, and you are not alone.

      "description": "In today\u2019s video, Dr. Christine Cocchiola speaks to one of the most painful realities for protective parents \u2014 the experience of feeling like you\u2019re raising two different children.\n\nThe child you knew \u2014 the tender, playful, trusting little one \u2014 and the child who now feels angry, withdrawn, dysregulated, or aggressive toward the very parent they are safest with. Dr. Christine explains why this shift is not a personality change or a parenting failure, but a trauma response to coercive control and unacknowledged child abuse.\n\nChildren living in abusive family systems are often operating from the survival part of the brain. They don\u2019t feel safe. They can\u2019t be fully themselves. And because it is unsafe to direct anger or fear toward the abusive parent, those feelings are often displaced onto the protective parent.\n\nIn this episode, Dr. Christine explores:\n\nWhy children can feel like \u201Cdifferent kids\u201D after abuse\n\nHow trauma fractures a child\u2019s sense of safety and identity\n\nWhy anger, withdrawal, or aggression are forms of self-defense\n\nThe grief parents feel when the child they imagined changes\n\nHow personal power helps parents \u201Clevel up\u201D instead of collapsing\n\nWhy healing is about helping children become the healthiest version of themselves \u2014 even under horrific circumstances\n\nShe also highlights her \u201CConnect the Dots\u201D video series, created for children who are beginning to recognize and name their experiences of abuse in a way that feels safe and validating.\n\n\uD83D\uDC99 If this resonates, please subscribe and share.\nYou are not imagining what you\u2019re seeing \u2014 and you are not alone in this.\n\n\uD83C\uDF3F Join Dr. C\u2019s Community for support and connection:\nhttps://go.drcocchiola.com/innercirclecommunity\n\n#DrChristineCocchiola\n#CoerciveControl\n#ProtectiveParenting\n#ChildhoodTrauma\n#TraumaResponses\n#PostSeparationAbuse\n#AttachmentHealing\n#FamilyCourtIssues\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Follow Dr. Christine on IG: www.instagram.com/dr.cocchiola_coercivecontrol\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Visit her website: https://coercivecontrolconsulting.com \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Become a Certified Trauma-Informed Protective Parent in this intensive educational program with an option for LIVE coaching/support to guide protective parents as they navigate the stormy seas of parenting a child who has been coercively controlled. \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Sign up here: https://go.drcocchiola.com/accelerated2-selfstudy",

      "description": "In today\u2019s video, Dr. Christine Cocchiola explores an essential distinction that is often distorted in coercively controlling family systems: the difference between personal power and power over.\n\nPersonal power is about agency, voice, and healthy boundaries. It is the ability to assert yourself, care for your children, and create structure that supports growth and independence. Power over, on the other hand, is what abusers use \u2014 control, domination, and coercion.\n\nDr. Christine explains why, when protective parents begin asserting healthy boundaries, abusers often accuse them of being \u201Ccontrolling.\u201D This tactic is frequently used not only against partners, but also against children \u2014 where structure, support, and expectations are reframed as harm.\n\nShe discusses:\n\nWhy asserting personal power can trigger backlash\n\nHow abusers co-opt the language of control\n\nThe impact this has on children\u2019s perception of the safe parent\n\nWhy children need agency and structure\n\nHow teaching children personal power protects them long-term\n\nDr. Christine also invites listeners to explore her podcast, Perfect Prey, where she interviews survivors, professionals, and advocates \u2014 including David Challen and Anne Burgess \u2014 to deepen understanding of coercive control and its impact across the lifespan.\n\n\uD83D\uDC99 If this resonates, please subscribe and share.\nPersonal power is not something to apologize for \u2014 it is something to reclaim.\n\n\uD83C\uDF3F Join Dr. C\u2019s Community for education, support, and connection:\nhttps://go.drcocchiola.com/innercirclecommunity\n\n#DrChristineCocchiola\n#PersonalPower\n#CoerciveControl\n#ProtectiveParenting\n#Boundaries\n#NarcissisticAbuse\n#PostSeparationAbuse\n#AttachmentHealing\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Follow Dr. Christine on IG: www.instagram.com/dr.cocchiola_coercivecontrol\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Visit her website: https://coercivecontrolconsulting.com \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Become a Certified Trauma-Informed Protective Parent in this intensive educational program with an option for LIVE coaching/support to guide protective parents as they navigate the stormy seas of parenting a child who has been coercively controlled. \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Sign up here: https://go.drcocchiola.com/accelerated2-selfstudy",

      "description": "n this episode of Perfect Prey, I\u2019m joined by David Challen, author of The Unthinkable, who shares his experience growing up as a child inside a coercively controlling family system. David offers a rare and powerful perspective on coercive control through the eyes of a child\u2014long before there was language to describe abuse, and long before systems were willing to see it.\n\nThis conversation explores how coercive control creates an atmosphere of fear, vigilance, humiliation, and emotional captivity within families, even when there is no visible violence. David reflects on the early intuition that something was wrong, the \u201Crot in the house\u201D that others could not see, and how children normalize danger in order to survive. Together, we examine the intergenerational harm caused by coercive control and why children are not passive witnesses, but co-victims.\n\nWhat we cover\nWhat coercive control looks and feels like through the eyes of a child\nHow children sense danger, imbalance, and domination long before abuse is named\nThe normalization of mockery, humiliation, fear, and emotional subservience within families\nWhy coercive control is not \u201Chidden abuse,\u201D but a trajectory of escalating harm\nHow long-term psychological domination strips autonomy, identity, and safety over time\nThe concept of \u201Csystemic degradation\u201D and how victims are worn down across years or decades\nWhy victim retaliation is often misunderstood, mislabeled, and criminalized\nThe long-term impact on adult child survivors and protective parents\n\n\nWhy listen\n If you are a survivor, protective parent, adult child survivor, clinician, or legal professional, this episode offers critical insight into how coercive control operates inside families and why children are deeply affected\u2014even when abuse is not outwardly visible. This conversation brings clarity to experiences that are often minimized, misunderstood, or dismissed, and highlights why coercive control must be recognized as the foundation of all abuse.\n\nGuest bio (short)\n David Challen is an author, speaker, and campaigner on domestic abuse and coercive control. He is the author of The Unthinkable, which tells the story of growing up in a coercively controlled household and the devastating impact of long-term psychological abuse on children and families. David is a prominent advocate for greater recognition of coercive control and has spoken widely about intergenerational harm, survivor justice, and systemic failure.\n\n\nConnect David Challen:\nInstagram: https://l1nq.com/davidinstagram\nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@davidchallen?is_from_webapp=1\u0026sender_device=pc\nLearn more about David: https://www.eida.org.uk/davids-story\nWebsite: https://l1nq.com/davidchallenwebsite\nThe Unthinkable: https://www.hachette.co.uk/titles/david-challen/the-unthinkable/9781914240263/\n\n\n\nConnect with Dr. Christine:\nProtective Parenting Program: https://www.coercivecontrolconsulting.com/services/for-parents/\nOfficial site: https://www.coercivecontrolconsulting.com/\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/@DrCocchiola-coercivecontrol/videos\nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.c_coercivecontrol\nIG: https://www.instagram.com/dr.cocchiola_coercivecontrol/\nTEDxTalks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp2qByKOue4\u0026t=24s\nBooks: https://url-shortener.me/c/FramedBook\nhttps://url-shortener.me/c/EveryMomentOfEveryDay\n\nIf this episode landed for you, please share it with someone who needs to hear it, subscribe for more trauma-informed conversations, and consider leaving a review \u2014 it helps other survivors find validation and safety.\n\u2014 Dr. Christine Cocchiola \u0026 guest David Challen\n\n\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Follow Dr. Christine on IG: www.instagram.com/dr.cocchiola_coercivecontrol\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Visit her website: https://coercivecontrolconsulting.com \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Become a Certified Trauma-Informed Protective Parent in this intensive educational program with an option for LIVE coaching/support to guide protective parents as they navigate the stormy seas of parenting a child who has been coercively controlled. \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Sign up here: https://go.drcocchiola.com/accelerated2-selfstudy",

She offers gentle guidance on why remaining steady matters more than protecting yourself from rejection.\n\nShe encourages parents to continue sending:\n\nA simple card\n\nA small, thoughtful gift\n\nA brief message of unconditional love\n\n\u2014not to get a response, not to provoke guilt, and not to manipulate, but to anchor safety and consistency.\n\nChildren impacted by coercive control are highly sensitive to tone and intention. Even well-meant statements can be perceived as manipulative if they hint at jealousy, resentment, or expectation. Dr. Christine explains why less is more, and why unconditional love \u2014 without explanation or pressure \u2014 is the most powerful message you can send.\n\n\u2728 In this video, Dr. Christine discusses:\n\nWhy holidays are especially painful for protective parents\n\nWhen to send a card or gift even if it may be rejected\n\nHow certain phrases can be misinterpreted\n\nWhy steadiness builds long-term safety\n\nHow unconditional love supports eventual reconnection\n\n\uD83D\uDC99 If this resonates, please subscribe and share.\nYou are not alone, and your steadiness matters more than you know.\n\n\uD83C\uDF3F Join Dr. C\u2019s Community for support and connection:\nhttps://go.drcocchiola.com/innercirclecommunity\n\n#DrChristineCocchiola\n#HolidayGrief\n#ProtectiveParenting\n#CoerciveControl\n#PostSeparationAbuse\n#EstrangedChildren\n#UnconditionalLove\n#AttachmentHealing\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Follow Dr. Christine on IG: www.instagram.com/dr.cocchiola_coercivecontrol\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Visit her website: https://coercivecontrolconsulting.com \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Become a Certified Trauma-Informed Protective Parent in this intensive educational program with an option for LIVE coaching/support to guide protective parents as they navigate the stormy seas of parenting a child who has been coercively controlled. \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Sign up here: https://go.drcocchiola.com/accelerated2-selfstudy",

      "description": "In this episode of Perfect Prey, I\u2019m joined by Anne Wintemute, co-creator of Aimee Says, an innovative AI platform designed specifically to support victims and survivors of coercive control. Aimee Says helps survivors understand abusive communication patterns, validate their lived experiences, and assist with documentation\u2014particularly in high-stakes situations such as custody and family court.\n\nWe explore why victims and survivors are not harmed because of character flaws, but because abusers intentionally target people who are kind, empathic, agreeable, and giving. Anne explains how Aimee Says was built around expertise in coercive control, narcissistic abuse, domestic violence, and power-and-control dynamics\u2014and why that specialization matters.\n\nWhat we cover\nWhat Aimee Says is and how it supports survivors of coercive control\nWhy validation and being truly heard are foundational to healing and decision-making\nHow Aimee helps identify gaslighting, financial abuse, intimidation, and coercive patterns\nUsing Aimee Says to support documentation, journaling, and preparation for legal processes\nKey differences between Aimee Says and general AI tools, including safety, trauma-informed guardrails, and survivor-centered design\nPrivacy, confidentiality, and safety considerations for survivors navigating digital tools\nHow tools like Aimee Says can reduce isolation and help restore agency and clarity\n\nWhy listen\nIf you are a survivor, protective parent, clinician, attorney, or advocate, this episode offers a grounded, accessible explanation of how coercive control operates and why survivors so often feel confused, minimized, or silenced. You\u2019ll also learn how thoughtfully designed tools can help survivors feel validated, supported, and better equipped to navigate complex systems.\n\nGuest bio (short)\nAnne Wintemute is the co-creator of Aimee Says, an AI-powered platform developed to support victims and survivors of coercive control through validation, pattern recognition, and trauma-informed guidance.

      "description": "In today\u2019s video, Dr. Christine Cocchiola speaks directly to protective parents asking one of the most painful questions:\n\u201CWhy did this happen to me?\u201D\n\nDr. Christine explains a critical truth \u2014 if you had met someone with your values, empathy, and relational style, this would not have happened. Abuse does not occur because of who you are. It happens because of who the abuser is.\n\nAbusers are often antagonistic, highly conflict-oriented, disagreeable, and intolerant of autonomy. Over time, through gaslighting, intimidation, isolation, and manipulation, they force their partner to become smaller and smaller \u2014 not because the partner is weak, but because survival required constant regulation.\n\nDr. Christine also discusses:\n\nWhy abusers escalate post-separation\n\nHow trauma bonds keep people hoping the \u201Cgood version\u201D will return\n\nWhy clarity often comes only after the abuse intensifies\n\nThe role of neuroticism and obsession in post-separation punishment\n\nWhy radical acceptance is necessary for healing\n\nWhy this experience has nothing to do with your worth, intelligence, or strength\n\nAs Dr. Christine reminds viewers: \u201CIt\u2019s not you. It\u2019s them.\u201D\nAnd once the trauma bond breaks, clarity begins to return \u2014 even though the grief remains.\n\n\uD83D\uDC99 If this resonates, please subscribe and share.\nYour experience is real.

      "description": "In today\u2019s video, Dr. Christine Cocchiola discusses how to rebuild empathy in children who have been harmed by coercive control and predatory parenting.\n\nMany protective parents wonder why their child seems unkind, distant, or uninterested when the parent is hurt, tired, or struggling. Dr. Christine explains that this is often not a lack of care \u2014 it is the result of oppression, entitlement, and emotional conditioning by the abusive parent, who teaches the child not to extend themselves toward the safe parent.\n\nEmpathy doesn\u2019t return through confrontation or guilt. It is rebuilt through small, intentional, attuned opportunities that allow the child to succeed rather than fail.\n\nIn this video, Dr. Christine explains:\n\nWhy children of coercive control lose empathy skills\n\nHow oppression and permissive parenting disrupt development\n\nWhy timing matters more than rules\n\nThe difference between regulating yourself vs. walking on eggshells\n\nHow to create success-based opportunities for empathy\n\nWhy these children are often not at their chronological age\n\nHow to rebuild competence without power struggles\n\nThese children have lost skills \u2014 not values. With patience, creativity, and attunement, empathy can be gently restored.\n\n\uD83D\uDC99 If this supports you, please subscribe and share.\nYour steadiness, intention, and compassion matter more than you know.\n\n\uD83C\uDF3F Join Dr. C\u2019s Community for education and support:\nhttps://go.drcocchiola.com/innercirclecommunity\n\n#DrChristineCocchiola\n#CoerciveControl\n#ProtectiveParenting\n#EmpathyBuilding\n#TraumaInformedParenting\n#PostSeparationAbuse\n#NarcissisticAbuse\n#AttachmentHealing\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Follow Dr. Christine on IG: www.instagram.com/dr.cocchiola_coercivecontrol\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Visit her website: https://coercivecontrolconsulting.com \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Become a Certified Trauma-Informed Protective Parent in this intensive educational program with an option for LIVE coaching/support to guide protective parents as they navigate the stormy seas of parenting a child who has been coercively controlled. \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Sign up here: https://go.drcocchiola.com/accelerated2-selfstudy",

      "description": "In this deeply personal episode, Dr. Christine Cocchiola shares her own story \u2014 how she spent decades studying, teaching, and treating coercive control, yet did not recognize that she and her two children were living in it themselves.\n\nLike so many protective parents, she worked endlessly to \u201Cfix\u201D the marriage, unaware that her children were being indoctrinated with false narratives about her from day one. It was only years after the final separation that she learned just how long the coercive control had been shaping their beliefs, behaviors, and sense of identity.\n\nDr. Christine explains why coercive control is the underpinning of all abuse, why even the most trained professionals can miss it, and why children living in these systems develop chronic self-doubt, social anxiety, and difficulty being authentically themselves.\n\nShe also discusses:\n\n\u2728 Why children regulate their behavior to survive\n\u2728 How shame forms when children are forced to repeat false narratives\n\u2728 Why some therapy models unintentionally support the abuser\n\u2728 How attachment and authenticity must coexist for healing\n\u2728 Why parenting must change when a child has been harmed\n\u2728 The lifelong grief parents carry \u2014 even when children eventually reconnect\n\nDr. Christine created her Protective Parenting Program because she believes protective parents are often the most effective healers for their children.

Sarma shares her lived experience of sustained psychological coercion, how it felt to be worn down and re-anchored in someone else\u2019s reality, and what the recovery process looks like after a relationship that functioned much like a one-on-one cult.\nWhat we cover\nHow coercive control can operate like psychological warfare and the tactics that make it feel impossible to leave.\n\n\nWhy intelligent, accomplished people can become victims: the slow wearing down, mirroring, and exploitation of hopes and vulnerabilities.\n\n\nThe parallels between cult dynamics and one-on-one coercive relationships\u2014why isolation and repeated micro-assaults change perception and decision-making.\n\n\nThe aftermath: public shame, misrepresentation in media, and the ongoing work of reclaiming agency, safety, and reputation.\n\n\nPractical reflections for survivors and protective parents: how to notice red flags early, the power of sitting with your intuition, and how healing helps rebuild boundaries and clarity.\n\n\nWhy listen\n Sarma\u2019s story illustrates that coercive control is not about intelligence or credentials \u2014 it\u2019s about a strategic, multifaceted assault on agency and reality.

      "description": "In today\u2019s video, Dr. Christine Cocchiola shares practical, healing-focused ways protective parents can reignite attachment with children who have been harmed, manipulated, or distanced by an abusive parent.\n\nShe explains why small environmental changes\u2014like moving a photo, placing an old picture on the counter during breakfast, or sending a benign childhood memory by text\u2014can awaken parts of the brain connected to safety, joy, and belonging. These moments help children reconnect to the truth of their relationship with the protective parent.\n\nDr. Christine also discusses why children may pull away, become non-responsive, or reject contact, and how this is often a direct result of years of coercive control\u2014not a reflection of who you are as a parent.\n\nTo rebuild connection, she emphasizes:\n\n\u2728 Using photos and shared memories to gently spark attachment\n\u2728 Sending benign, expectation-free messages\n\u2728 Avoiding triggers that push children into the \u201Cunsafe\u201D brain state\n\u2728 Understanding the difference between \u201Cwalking on eggshells\u201D with an abuser vs. regulating yourself for your child\u2019s healing\n\u2728 Why trying to \u201Ccorrect\u201D or direct an estranged child often backfires\n\nChildren impacted by coercive control are not the same children they once were.

      "title": "Why Therapy for Children of Coercive Control is NOT always the answer Part 2",
      "description": "In this episode, Dr. Christine Cocchiola continues the conversation on why therapy can sometimes become a trap for children living under coercive control.\n\nWhen children are forced into therapy while carrying a false narrative created by the abusive parent, they may feel pressured to repeat harmful statements about their safe, protective parent. Many therapists\u2014without training in coercive control\u2014may unintentionally affirm this narrative, not realizing the child is speaking from fear, confusion, or manipulation.\n\nDr. Christine explains how this dynamic can create shame, emotional discomfort, and deep internal conflict for the child. Instead of healing, they may feel trapped in a cycle of saying things they don\u2019t believe, simply to survive the abusive environment.\n\nShe also highlights why it\u2019s essential to teach children critical thinking, helping them gently explore:\n\nWhere did this idea come from?\n\nDid I experience this, or was I told this?\n\nWho benefits from me believing this?\n\nTherapy can be helpful, but only with professionals who truly understand coercive control. Otherwise, it can increase shame, reinforce false narratives, and put the child in emotionally damaging positions.\n\nDr. Christine also previews her next video, where she\u2019ll discuss how certain well-intended protective-parent behaviors can unintentionally lead a child to identify with the aggressor \u2014 and how to shift those dynamics with compassion and awareness.\n\n\uD83D\uDC9B If this resonates, please subscribe, share, and help support families navigating these painful dynamics.\nYou are not alone.\n\n\uD83C\uDF3F Join Dr. C\u2019s Community for support, education, and connection:\nhttps://go.drcocchiola.com/innercirclecommunity\n\n#DrChristineCocchiola #CoerciveControl #ChildTherapy #ProtectiveParenting #FalseNarratives #TraumaInformedCare #PostSeparationAbuse #ParentalManipulation #NarcissisticAbuse #FamilyCourtIssues\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Follow Dr. Christine on IG: www.instagram.com/dr.cocchiola_coercivecontrol\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Visit her website: https://coercivecontrolconsulting.com \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Become a Certified Trauma-Informed Protective Parent in this intensive educational program with an option for LIVE coaching/support to guide protective parents as they navigate the stormy seas of parenting a child who has been coercively controlled. \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Sign up here: https://go.drcocchiola.com/accelerated2-selfstudy",

      "description": "In today\u2019s video, Dr. Christine Cocchiola speaks to protective parents whose children return from the other parent\u2019s home sad, angry, confused, or deeply dysregulated.\nThis is one of the most painful and common experiences in coercive control dynamics \u2014 when a child\u2019s body tells the truth before they have the words to describe it.\n\nDr. Christine explains how children experience somatic cues:\n\u201CMy belly hurts\u2026 my head feels bad\u2026 something inside me doesn\u2019t feel right,\u201D\nand how these sensations often reveal their discomfort or fear, even when they\u2019re unable to articulate what\u2019s happening in unsafe environments.\n\nShe also discusses the heartbreaking reality of being forced by systems to send your child to the predatory parent, even when the child is showing clear signs of distress. This is a form of systemic coercive control, and it leaves protective parents feeling dismissed, blamed, or entirely unheard.\n\nDr. Christine shares how her new children\u2019s book, Every Moment of Every Day, helps parents support their child through these dysregulated transitions, offering validation, connection, and somatic awareness for little ones living with these complex experiences.\n\n\u2728 In this video, Dr. Christine covers:\n\nWhy children become dysregulated before or after unsafe parenting time\n\nSomatic warning signs children feel in their bodies\n\nWhy systems often dismiss protective parents\n\nHow to validate your child\u2019s emotions and boundaries\n\nWhy protective parents have more influence than they realize\n\nHow Every Moment of Every Day supports these conversations\n\n\uD83D\uDC9B If this resonates, please subscribe and share.\nYou are not alone.

      "description": "In today\u2019s video, Dr. Christine Cocchiola breaks down the reality of the predatory parent \u2014 individuals who use coercive control, narcissistic tactics, manipulation, and system exploitation to harm their partners and children.\n\nShe explains why coercive control is the underpinning of all abuse and why these dynamics don\u2019t start with physical violence. Instead, they begin with power, control, psychological domination, and escalate over time \u2014 especially after separation, when the abuser feels their power slipping.\n\nDr. Christine dives into the traits often seen in predatory parents:\n\nNarcissism (grandiosity, victimhood, no genuine empathy)\n\nMachiavellianism (manipulation, flying monkeys, DARVO)\n\nPsychopathy (willingness to break the law, stalking, tracking devices, harassment)\n\nSadism (deriving satisfaction from causing emotional harm)\n\nShe emphasizes an essential truth: abusers weaponize children because they know children are what matter most to the protective parent.\n\nUnderstanding these patterns is the first step toward clarity, safety planning, and protecting both yourself and your children.\n\n\uD83D\uDC9B If this resonates with you, please subscribe and share.\nYou are not alone, and your clarity is powerful.\n\n\uD83C\uDF3F Join Dr. C\u2019s Community for deeper education and support:\nhttps://go.drcocchiola.com/innercirclecommunity\n\n#DrChristineCocchiola #PredatoryParent #CoerciveControl #NarcissisticAbuse #PsychologicalAbuse #PostSeparationAbuse #DARVO #Narcissism #ProtectiveParenting #TraumaRecovery\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Follow Dr. Christine on IG: www.instagram.com/dr.cocchiola_coercivecontrol\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Visit her website: https://coercivecontrolconsulting.com \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Become a Certified Trauma-Informed Protective Parent in this intensive educational program with an option for LIVE coaching/support to guide protective parents as they navigate the stormy seas of parenting a child who has been coercively controlled. \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Sign up here: https://go.drcocchiola.com/accelerated2-selfstudy",

Most importantly, Dr. Christine reminds protective parents that their connection and safety remain their child\u2019s greatest source of healing.\n\n\u2728 Key topics covered:\n\nWhat the ACE Study teaches us about trauma\n\nThe connection between coercive control and adverse experiences\n\nWhy coercive control isn\u2019t fully reflected in the ACE framework\n\nHow safe parents can still protect and fortify attachment\n\nInsights from Dr. Judith Herman and Bessel van der Kolk\n\n\uD83D\uDC9B If this resonates with you, please subscribe, share this video, and explore more conversations on trauma, recovery, and advocacy.\n\u27A1\uFE0F Listen to Dr. Christine\u2019s podcast, Perfect Prey, for more in-depth discussions.\n\n#DrChristineCocchiola #AdverseChildhoodExperiences #CoerciveControl #TraumaRecovery #Attachment #ParentingAfterAbuse #JudithHerman #BesselVanderKolk #ACEStudy\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Follow Dr. Christine on IG: www.instagram.com/dr.cocchiola_coercivecontrol\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Visit her website: https://coercivecontrolconsulting.com \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Become a Certified Trauma-Informed Protective Parent in this intensive educational program with an option for LIVE coaching/support to guide protective parents as they navigate the stormy seas of parenting a child who has been coercively controlled. \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Sign up here: https://go.drcocchiola.com/accelerated2-selfstudy",

Over time, these tactics distort a child\u2019s sense of safety and connection, leaving protective parents feeling alienated and powerless.\n\nThis episode helps you understand:\n\nWhy \u201Cparental alienation\u201D is often misused in family court\n\nHow abusers weaponize attachment to harm both parent and child\n\nWhat protective parents can do to rebuild and fortify their child\u2019s secure bond\n\nWhy awareness and intentional reconnection are key to healing fractured attachment\n\nIf this resonates with you, remember \u2014 you\u2019re not alone.

      "description": "In this episode, Dr. Christine Cocchiola unpacks one of the toughest questions protective parents face: should you take the abuser back to court when your child resists visitation or therapy? A mom with a 16-year-old who no longer wants to visit and a 19-year-old off at college wonders if mandating therapy and enforcing shared custody through the court is the right step.\n\nDr. Cocchiola explores the costs and benefits of returning to court. While the desire to prove to your child that you fought for them is powerful, the hidden costs can be devastating. Abusers often retaliate by intensifying control and punishment, targeting the child as a weapon. This leaves the developing brain depleted, unable to regulate, connect, or process. The child may then appear aligned with the abuser not out of preference, but out of sheer survival.\n\nParents must ask: is the fight in court truly in the best interest of the child, or does it risk greater harm? Dr. Cocchiola stresses the importance of weighing these choices carefully. Sometimes letting go of the rope is not giving up, but protecting your child from further suffering. It sends the message that your love and safety are constant, your door is always open, and you understand why they made the choices they did under coercion.\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Follow Dr. Christine on IG: www.instagram.com/dr.cocchiola_coercivecontrol\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Visit her website: https://coercivecontrolconsulting.com \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Become a Certified Trauma-Informed Protective Parent in this intensive educational program with an option for LIVE coaching/support to guide protective parents as they navigate the stormy seas of parenting a child who has been coercively controlled. \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Sign up here: https://go.drcocchiola.com/accelerated2-selfstudy",

      "description": "Coercive control is the root of nearly every form of abuse, from domestic violence and child abuse to sex trafficking, racism, and even terrorism. In this episode, Dr. Cocchiola explains why recognizing patterns of power and control is critical for therapists, parents, and anyone navigating high-conflict relationships. Drawing on research showing that 68% of mass shooters had a history of domestic abuse, she warns how these behaviors reveal character traits that escalate over time. Dr. Cocchiola outlines the differences between abusers and victims: abusers think in rigid black-and-white terms, while victims often show empathy, optimism, and a tendency to forgive even at their own expense. Through the dominance lens, you will learn how to identify covert and overt forms of control, such as one partner managing all the finances, constant mockery, or using a loved one\u2019s vulnerabilities against them. She stresses that true accountability requires mutuality, reciprocity, and immediate behavioral change, not excuses, minimization, or forcing the victim to accommodate abuse. This talk also challenges cultural biases, especially the higher standards often placed on women in therapy, and emphasizes why children, like adults, should never be made to live with or excuse abusive behavior.\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Follow Dr. Christine on IG: www.instagram.com/dr.cocchiola_coercivecontrol\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Visit her website: https://coercivecontrolconsulting.com \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Become a Certified Trauma-Informed Protective Parent in this intensive educational program with an option for LIVE coaching/support to guide protective parents as they navigate the stormy seas of parenting a child who has been coercively controlled. \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Sign up here: https://go.drcocchiola.com/accelerated2-selfstudy",

      "description": "In this episode of Perfect Prey, I sit down with Vanessa Reiser, LCSW, a renowned psychotherapist, speaker, and advocate who has dedicated her career to helping survivors of narcissistic abuse and coercive control reclaim their lives. Vanessa is the founder of Tell a Therapist, a nationwide telehealth platform, and the author of Narcissistic Abuse: A Therapist\u2019s Guide, a groundbreaking resource that not only unpacks the devastating impact of narcissistic and cult abuse but also offers clinicians the training and tools they need to support survivors in the healing process. Together, we explore what coercive control looks like in real life. We talk about why certain people are more vulnerable to narcissistic abuse, the toll it takes on mental health, and how survivors can begin to recognize the patterns and break free. We also shine a light on the unique challenges survivors face in family court when narcissistic abuse is involved, and why therapist training in this area is so urgently needed. Vanessa\u2019s book is an essential guide for professionals and survivors alike, offering not just insight but hope\u2014that recovery is possible, and that healing from narcissistic abuse is about reclaiming your voice, your power, and your life.

      "description": "In this episode of Perfect Prey: A Coercive Control Podcast, Dr. Christine Cocchiola sits down with Dr. Peter Salerno to take a deeper look at the hidden dynamics of coercive control and the psychological abuse that entraps partners and children in cycles of fear, confusion, and dependency. We explore the defining traits of coercive controllers, how they manipulate both adult and child victims, and why survivors often struggle with cognitive dissonance, a mental conflict that can keep them tethered to abusive relationships long after the harm is clear. Together, we discuss the traumatic impact of cognitive dissonance, how abusers condition children to adopt distorted beliefs, and what protective strategies parents can use to safeguard their children\u2019s well-being. You\u2019ll also hear about the crucial role of trauma-informed therapy, ways to respond intentionally to children\u2019s conditioned behaviors, and how survivors can begin to break free from the psychological grip of coercive control. This conversation sheds light on the complex psychological dynamics of abuse and offers practical steps for supporting both adults and children who have been targeted by coercive controllers. If you\u2019ve ever felt trapped in a relationship that left you doubting your own reality, or if you\u2019re working to protect children from ongoing manipulation, this episode will give you clarity, tools, and hope for the path forward.

      "description": "In this episode of Perfect Prey, I sit down with filmmaker and NXIVM Whistleblower, Mark Vicente, to explore the insidious nature of narcissism and coercive control. Known for his role in exposing the NXIVM cult and for his upcoming documentary Narcissist Playbook, Mark brings a rare blend of lived experience and narrative insight to a conversation that is both deeply personal and profoundly educational. Together, we examine how narcissistic abuse thrives on confusion, manipulation, and silence. Coercive control isn\u0027t always visible\u2014often it hides in plain sight, eroding a survivor\u2019s sense of self through emotional, psychological, and sometimes spiritual abuse. Mark shares how he came to recognize the patterns of power and control he endured, and why storytelling and awareness are key to dismantling these dynamics. As a licensed clinical social worker and survivor of coercive control myself, this conversation is one I know will resonate. We talk about the trauma of emotional abuse, the grooming tactics abusers use to gain and maintain control, and the long road to healing after escaping these toxic dynamics. Mark\u2019s courage and clarity offer validation to those still trying to make sense of what happened to them, and hope to those who are just beginning to find their voice. This is more than a podcast episode\u2026 it\u2019s a call to awareness, to healing, and to action. Tune in to better understand the trauma of coercive control and narcissistic relationships, and to remember that your truth is the first step toward freedom.

About Dr. Nadine: Dr. Nadine Macaluso, known to her patients as Dr. Nae, is the real-life inspiration behind Naomi Belfort\u0027s character in \u0022The Wolf of Wall Street.\u0022 She survived a turbulent eight-year marriage to Jordan Belfort, marked by abuse, greed, and trauma. Following her experiences, Dr. Macaluso relocated to California. Her journey of trauma and healing inspired her to return to school at age 39, where she earned her Master\u0027s in counseling and a Ph.D. in somatic psychotherapy. She further specialized with a two-year postdoctoral training in the Neuro-affective Relational Model (NARM). As a therapist, Dr. Macaluso combines her education and personal experiences to help others heal from trauma. Her practice focuses on assisting patients in connecting with their authentic selves, fostering confidence, resilience, and agency. Dr. Macaluso firmly believes in the potential for post-traumatic growth, instilling hope in her patients and guiding them to reach their potential in life and love. --- \u0026#x1f538;Follow Dr. Christine on IG: www.instagram.com/dr.cocchiola_coercivecontrol \u0026#x1f538;Visit her website: https://coercivecontrolconsulting.com \u0026#x1f538;Become a Certified Trauma-Informed Protective Parent in this intensive educational program with an option for LIVE coaching/support to guide protective parents as they navigate the stormy seas of parenting a child who has been coercively controlled. \u0026#x1f538;Sign up here: https://go.drcocchiola.com/pppwselfstudy",

      "description": "Kantianism comes from the philosopher Immanuel Kant: \u0022the idea that we have a moral duty to act in a good way - whether it benefits us or not. People are ends unto themselves and not pawns in someone else\u2019s games\u0022 - unless of course, we are dealing with a coercive controller [narcissistic abuser]. Then everyone is fair game - especially our children. In this in-depth episode, Dr. Cocchiola explores how individuals, often narcissistic abusers or coercive controllers, prey on empathetic and loyal individuals. She then expands this concept to children who may be more susceptible to this form of manipulation due to the power dynamics with parents or guardians. She emphasizes the importance of understanding these manipulations and the dangers they pose within families. Dr. Cocchiola examines the coercive controller\u0027s tactics, from manipulating children and weaponizing them against the protective parent to using children to fill their ego tanks. She also discusses the damage this form of abuse causes, defining it as betrayal trauma and complex trauma, and echoes a strong need for recognition and intervention.
