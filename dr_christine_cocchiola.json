      "description": "In this episode, Dr. Christine Cocchiola unpacks one of the toughest questions protective parents face: should you take the abuser back to court when your child resists visitation or therapy? A mom with a 16-year-old who no longer wants to visit and a 19-year-old off at college wonders if mandating therapy and enforcing shared custody through the court is the right step.\n\nDr. Cocchiola explores the costs and benefits of returning to court. While the desire to prove to your child that you fought for them is powerful, the hidden costs can be devastating. Abusers often retaliate by intensifying control and punishment, targeting the child as a weapon. This leaves the developing brain depleted, unable to regulate, connect, or process. The child may then appear aligned with the abuser not out of preference, but out of sheer survival.\n\nParents must ask: is the fight in court truly in the best interest of the child, or does it risk greater harm? Dr. Cocchiola stresses the importance of weighing these choices carefully. Sometimes letting go of the rope is not giving up, but protecting your child from further suffering. It sends the message that your love and safety are constant, your door is always open, and you understand why they made the choices they did under coercion.\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Follow Dr. Christine on IG: www.instagram.com/dr.cocchiola_coercivecontrol\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Visit her website: https://coercivecontrolconsulting.com \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Become a Certified Trauma-Informed Protective Parent in this intensive educational program with an option for LIVE coaching/support to guide protective parents as they navigate the stormy seas of parenting a child who has been coercively controlled. \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Sign up here: https://go.drcocchiola.com/accelerated2-selfstudy",

      "description": "Coercive control is the root of nearly every form of abuse, from domestic violence and child abuse to sex trafficking, racism, and even terrorism. In this episode, Dr. Cocchiola explains why recognizing patterns of power and control is critical for therapists, parents, and anyone navigating high-conflict relationships. Drawing on research showing that 68% of mass shooters had a history of domestic abuse, she warns how these behaviors reveal character traits that escalate over time. Dr. Cocchiola outlines the differences between abusers and victims: abusers think in rigid black-and-white terms, while victims often show empathy, optimism, and a tendency to forgive even at their own expense. Through the dominance lens, you will learn how to identify covert and overt forms of control, such as one partner managing all the finances, constant mockery, or using a loved one\u2019s vulnerabilities against them. She stresses that true accountability requires mutuality, reciprocity, and immediate behavioral change, not excuses, minimization, or forcing the victim to accommodate abuse. This talk also challenges cultural biases, especially the higher standards often placed on women in therapy, and emphasizes why children, like adults, should never be made to live with or excuse abusive behavior.\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Follow Dr. Christine on IG: www.instagram.com/dr.cocchiola_coercivecontrol\n\n\uD83D\uDD38Visit her website: https://coercivecontrolconsulting.com \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Become a Certified Trauma-Informed Protective Parent in this intensive educational program with an option for LIVE coaching/support to guide protective parents as they navigate the stormy seas of parenting a child who has been coercively controlled. \n\n\uD83D\uDD38Sign up here: https://go.drcocchiola.com/accelerated2-selfstudy",

      "description": "In this episode of Perfect Prey: A Coercive Control Podcast, Dr. Christine Cocchiola sits down with Dr. Peter Salerno to take a deeper look at the hidden dynamics of coercive control and the psychological abuse that entraps partners and children in cycles of fear, confusion, and dependency. We explore the defining traits of coercive controllers, how they manipulate both adult and child victims, and why survivors often struggle with cognitive dissonance, a mental conflict that can keep them tethered to abusive relationships long after the harm is clear. Together, we discuss the traumatic impact of cognitive dissonance, how abusers condition children to adopt distorted beliefs, and what protective strategies parents can use to safeguard their children\u2019s well-being. You\u2019ll also hear about the crucial role of trauma-informed therapy, ways to respond intentionally to children\u2019s conditioned behaviors, and how survivors can begin to break free from the psychological grip of coercive control. This conversation sheds light on the complex psychological dynamics of abuse and offers practical steps for supporting both adults and children who have been targeted by coercive controllers. If you\u2019ve ever felt trapped in a relationship that left you doubting your own reality, or if you\u2019re working to protect children from ongoing manipulation, this episode will give you clarity, tools, and hope for the path forward.

Together, we examine the role of coercive control in intimate partner violence, the systemic failures that too often leave victims unprotected, and the broader implications for Jennifers\u0027 Law in Connecticut. Rich Cohen is a bestselling author and award-winning journalist whose work has appeared in The New York Times, Vanity Fair, The Atlantic, and Rolling Stone. His keen ability to uncover the human story behind complex events has shaped his career as both a storyteller and social commentator, bringing clarity and depth to difficult conversations. Rich shares powerful insights into the patterns of abuse, the hidden nature of coercion, and why it is essential for all of us to recognize the warning signs.

      "description": "In this episode of Perfect Prey, I sit down with filmmaker and NXIVM Whistleblower, Mark Vicente, to explore the insidious nature of narcissism and coercive control. Known for his role in exposing the NXIVM cult and for his upcoming documentary Narcissist Playbook, Mark brings a rare blend of lived experience and narrative insight to a conversation that is both deeply personal and profoundly educational. Together, we examine how narcissistic abuse thrives on confusion, manipulation, and silence. Coercive control isn\u0027t always visible\u2014often it hides in plain sight, eroding a survivor\u2019s sense of self through emotional, psychological, and sometimes spiritual abuse. Mark shares how he came to recognize the patterns of power and control he endured, and why storytelling and awareness are key to dismantling these dynamics. As a licensed clinical social worker and survivor of coercive control myself, this conversation is one I know will resonate. We talk about the trauma of emotional abuse, the grooming tactics abusers use to gain and maintain control, and the long road to healing after escaping these toxic dynamics. Mark\u2019s courage and clarity offer validation to those still trying to make sense of what happened to them, and hope to those who are just beginning to find their voice. This is more than a podcast episode\u2026 it\u2019s a call to awareness, to healing, and to action. Tune in to better understand the trauma of coercive control and narcissistic relationships, and to remember that your truth is the first step toward freedom.

It happens to our children too\u2014they may become bonded to their abuser (your abuser). About Dr. Nadine: Dr. Nadine Macaluso, known to her patients as Dr. Nae, is the real-life inspiration behind Naomi Belfort\u0027s character in \u0022The Wolf of Wall Street.\u0022 She survived a turbulent eight-year marriage to Jordan Belfort, marked by abuse, greed, and trauma. Following her experiences, Dr. Macaluso relocated to California. Her journey of trauma and healing inspired her to return to school at age 39, where she earned her Master\u0027s in counseling and a Ph.D. in somatic psychotherapy. She further specialized with a two-year postdoctoral training in the Neuro-affective Relational Model (NARM). As a therapist, Dr. Macaluso combines her education and personal experiences to help others heal from trauma. Her practice focuses on assisting patients in connecting with their authentic selves, fostering confidence, resilience, and agency. Dr. Macaluso firmly believes in the potential for post-traumatic growth, instilling hope in her patients and guiding them to reach their potential in life and love. --- \u0026#x1f538;Follow Dr. Christine on IG: www.instagram.com/dr.cocchiola_coercivecontrol \u0026#x1f538;Visit her website: https://coercivecontrolconsulting.com \u0026#x1f538;Become a Certified Trauma-Informed Protective Parent in this intensive educational program with an option for LIVE coaching/support to guide protective parents as they navigate the stormy seas of parenting a child who has been coercively controlled. \u0026#x1f538;Sign up here: https://go.drcocchiola.com/pppwselfstudy",

      "description": "Kantianism comes from the philosopher Immanuel Kant: \u0022the idea that we have a moral duty to act in a good way - whether it benefits us or not. People are ends unto themselves and not pawns in someone else\u2019s games\u0022 - unless of course, we are dealing with a coercive controller [narcissistic abuser]. Then everyone is fair game - especially our children. In this in-depth episode, Dr. Cocchiola explores how individuals, often narcissistic abusers or coercive controllers, prey on empathetic and loyal individuals. She then expands this concept to children who may be more susceptible to this form of manipulation due to the power dynamics with parents or guardians. She emphasizes the importance of understanding these manipulations and the dangers they pose within families. Dr. Cocchiola examines the coercive controller\u0027s tactics, from manipulating children and weaponizing them against the protective parent to using children to fill their ego tanks. She also discusses the damage this form of abuse causes, defining it as betrayal trauma and complex trauma, and echoes a strong need for recognition and intervention.
