      "description": "In this Very Special episode of Sunscreen, Dave talks with his grandmother, Joan. This interview was conducted in 2018 and covers a wide variety of topics: everything from her personal memories of World War 2, to being involved with a cult for a short time, to the undeniably awesome stories of Dave\u0027s birth. Joan passed on June 29th 2024,and I figured this would be a great way to remember her and her experiences.",
