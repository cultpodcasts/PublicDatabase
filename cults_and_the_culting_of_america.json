      "description": "Summary The conversation explores the exploitation of labor in cults and its impact on individuals. It delves into the reasons why labor is at the center of cults, including the pursuit of power, financial gain, and the whitewashing of cult activities. The discussion also highlights the role of labor in high control religious groups and the manipulation of children to represent the group\u0027s ideals. The conversation expands to include the exploitation of labor in corporations and the systemic nature of labor exploitation in the United States. It concludes by examining the long-lasting effects of labor exploitation on individuals\u0027 mental and physical health. In this conversation, Daniella and Scot discuss the exploitation of labor and the pressure to constantly work. They explore how cults and other high-control groups use labor as a means of control and how this mindset is perpetuated in society. They also touch on the importance of self-care and the need to break free from the transactional nature of relationships. The conversation highlights the negative consequences of constant labor and the importance of setting healthy boundaries.

Children are particularly vulnerable to labor exploitation in cults and high control religious groups. Labor exploitation is not limited to religious organizations and can also occur in corporations. The systemic exploitation of labor has long-lasting effects on individuals\u0027 mental and physical health. Cults and high-control groups use labor as a means of control and exploitation. Society perpetuates the idea that constant work and productivity are necessary for success. Self-care and setting healthy boundaries are essential for mental and emotional well-being. The transactional nature of relationships can lead to disappointment and dissatisfaction. The pressure to constantly work and achieve can result in burnout and negative health consequences.",

Isolation can be physical, but it can also be subtle and pervasive in various organizations and institutions. Isolation is often accompanied by intense activities and exhaustion, which can create feelings of euphoria and forge strong bonds within the group. Isolation can also be used to break down individual identity and make members more susceptible to indoctrination. Isolation can be reinforced through dress codes, language, and prohibitions against gossip and negative discussions. Isolation can lead to the formation of echo chambers and the reinforcement of groupthink. Social media algorithms can contribute to isolation by filtering out opposing viewpoints and creating personalized echo chambers.

The conversation also touches on the parallels between cult behavior and practices in organizations like the military and corporate America, offering insights into the pervasive influence of cult-like tactics in various aspects of society.\n \u00A0\n The episode explores key themes such as cults, high-control groups, and the concept of self-sacrifice, delving into how these groups exploit their members\u0027 labor under the guise of a transcendent mission. The discussion also touches on the idea of total institutions, where conformity is enforced through appearance and attitude control, and emotional manipulation is used to maintain control over members. By examining parallels between cult behavior and practices in organizations like the military and corporate culture, the hosts highlight the pervasive influence of these tactics in suppressing individual identity and enforcing group dynamics.

I\u0027m Scott Loyd along with my friend Daniella Mestyanek Young, and she\u0027s written a book called *Uncultured,* which you should pick up. Both of us are cult survivors, and we\u0027re working through a list of characteristics that Daniella developed to help all of you, along with us, process and understand our cult experiences, as well as identify cults and high-control groups. So with that introduction, Daniella, which characteristic are we talking about today?\n **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Thanks so much for the introduction, Scott. Today, we are going to be talking about self-sacrifice. Specifically, in cults, there\u0027s the constant and continual self-sacrifice of the members. If you\u0027re just joining us, episode one has the whole list of my 10 characteristics that make up a cult, and we\u0027re going through each of those in detail.\n Self-sacrifice is number four on the list, but it connects very directly to number eight on the list, which is exploitation of labor.\n **Scot Loyd:** And you\u0027ve mentioned before that this is ultimately what cults are all about\u2014free labor, right?\n **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Exactly. When I heard cult scholar Dr. Janja Lalich say, \u0022Cults are about labor,\u0022 it broke my brain and gave me a whole different understanding of what I had experienced and why we were doing the things we did. Labor is your one inexhaustible resource. The cult leader is out for power, but the cult itself is about getting your labor. They tell you it\u2019s in pursuit of a transcendent mission, which we covered in episode three.\n In the Children of God cult, our mission was saving the world for Jesus before the end times. In the US Army, it was protecting American interests overseas. These missions are so grand and unquestionably good that they allow the cult and its leaders to constantly pull sacrifice from their members.\n **Scot Loyd:** You sent me something to read today, and you mentioned a term\u2014quoting Irving Goffman\u2014called a \u0022total institution.\u0022 I think when we\u0027re talking about cults, they certainly qualify as tot",

They discuss how cult leaders use vague, life-and-death missions to manipulate and retain followers. These missions often promise fulfillment in an unprovable future, making followers feel unique and superior, thus willing to self-sacrifice and endure hardships.\n Daniella differentiates the transcendent mission from the sacred assumption, explaining that while the sacred assumption is an unspoken belief (e.g., the leader being the smartest or chosen one), the mission is what recruits and keeps people dedicated. The mission is rarely practical and constantly evolving, ensuring followers never feel they\u0027ve fully achieved it.\n The hosts also touch on the importance of recognizing the signs of manipulative missions, such as their vagueness, constant change, and exclusivity. Daniella advises that it\u2019s okay for individuals to focus on their own well-being and happiness instead of falling prey to manipulative missions.\n \u00A0\n   Daniella Mestyanek Young\u0027s book:\u00A0\n  \u00B7\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 From Bookshop.org\n    Uncultured  Autograph:\u00A0    Connect with Daniella on social media\n     TikTok,  Patreon,  Instagram\u00A0   Youtube    Connect with Scot Loyd\u0027s social media\u00A0 (TikTok)   Daniella\u0027s other podcast:  Hey White Women  \u00A0\n \u00A0\n **Hosts:** Daniella Mestyanek Young and Scot Loyd\n **Topic:** The Transcendent Mission in Cults and High-Control Groups\n **Overview:**\n In this episode, Daniella and Scot discuss the concept of the \u0022transcendent mission\u0022 and how it is used by cult leaders and high-control groups to manipulate and control their followers. They delve into the differences between the transcendent mission and the sacred assumption, the tactics used to recruit and retain followers, and the personal experiences of both hosts in various high-control environments.\n **Key Points:**\n 1. **Introduction to the Transcendent Mission:**\n \u00A0 \u00A0- Cult leaders create a transcendent mission to recruit and retain followers by promising a higher purpose or goal that often cannot be proven or achieved in this lifetime.\n \u00A0 \u00A0- The mission is usually vague, large-scale, and tied to life and death, making it compelling and difficult to question.\n 2. **Difference Between Transcendent Mission and Sacred Assumption:**\n \u00A0 \u00A0- The sacred assumption is an underlying, often unspoken belief that followers must accept to remain in good standing.\n \u00A0 \u00A0- The transcendent mission is the outward goal or purpose that the group is supposedly working towards, often used as a recruitment tool.\n 3. **Manipulation Tactics:**\n \u00A0 \u00A0- Cult leaders use the transcendent mission to justify extreme actions and sacrifices from their followers.\n \u00A0 \u00A0- Examples include religious cults promising salvation or enlightenment, and organizations like the military or corporations using missions to motivate self-sacrifice and loyalty.\n 4. **Personal Experiences:**\n \u00A0 \u00A0- Daniella shares her experiences in the Children of God cult and the US Army, highlighting the similarities in how both groups used a transcendent mission to control members.\n \u00A0 \u00A0- Scot discusses his upbringing in the United Pentecostal Church and how the promise of witnessing the return of Jesus was used to motivate followers.\n 5. **Challenges of Deconstruction:**\n \u00A0 \u00A0- Leaving a high-control group often involves losing a sense of mission and purpose, which can be terrifying and disorienting.\n \u00A0 \u00A0- Both hosts emphasize the importance of finding a new, personal mission that prioritizes individual well-being and happiness.\n 6. **Misconceptions About Good and Bad Cults:**\n \u00A0 \u00A0- Daniella argues that there is no such thing as a \u0022good cult\u0022 because the core mechanism of coercive control and self-sacrifice is inherently harmful.\n \u00A0 \u00A0- They discuss",

Daniella explains how cult leaders create and manipulate these worldviews to control their followers, emphasizing that these assumptions don\u0027t have to be religious but can revolve around power, status, or other ideals. The discussion touches on the similarities and differences between cults and religions, the manipulation tactics used by cult leaders, and the challenges of deconstructing these beliefs after leaving a cult. Daniella also shares personal anecdotes about her experiences with the Children of God cult and the US Army, highlighting the parallels between different high-control groups. Scot and Daniella discuss the ongoing process of deconstruction, the importance of questioning sacred assumptions, and the impact of privilege and societal constructs on our beliefs. They emphasize the need for skepticism and self-defined values, contrasting this with the often rigid and manipulative frameworks of cults. The episode concludes with a call to action for listeners to engage with Daniella\u0027s work, including her book Uncultured and her Patreon project UnAmerican.

I\u0027m your host, Scot Loyd. Welcome to another episode of Cults and the Culting of America. I\u0027m Scot Loyd, along with my friend Daniella Mestyanek Young. Not only is she my friend, but she is a scholar of cults, extreme groups, and extremely bad leadership. Daniella, how are you doing today? **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** I am doing great. I am excited for us to talk about the worldview shift into the transcendent mission and the most common question anyone gets asked about cults, which is: what is the difference between a cult and a religion? **Scot Loyd:** Very nicely said. I\u0027m looking forward to this episode. And you\u0027re wearing an interesting shirt today. Tell us about that shirt, and if folks want to buy one for themselves or their friends and family, how can they do that? **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Yes, you can find any of the shirts you see me wearing through the links below. I sell them through my social media channels. This shirt says, \u0022The first rule of cults is you\u0027re never in a cult,\u0022 which is the epigraph of my book, *Uncultured*. It\u0027s about growing up in the Children of God and joining the US Army. It\u0027s also a play on *Fight Club*, which a lot of people don\u0027t realize is kind of the cult movie. It really gets to the idea that nobody thinks they\u0027re in a cult. Cults are manipulative cons that target people, lie, deflect, and pull you into their worldview. As soon as you realize you\u0027re in a cult, you\u0027re on your way out. But many people think cults are extreme and rare, when in fact, they\u0027re incredibly common. A lot of my life\u0027s work is pointing out these parallels and helping people understand the groups and systems we\u0027re in. **Scot Loyd:** And we\u0027re going down the list of characteristics of a cult that you have identified and authored. Today we arrive at the idea of worldview, or as you call it, the sacred assumption. What do you mean by sacred assumption, and why is it a leading characteristic of a cult? **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Oh my gosh, this one is so dramatic. I mean, literally, I was in bed and I sat up and just yelled out, \u0022Hold nothing sacred.\u0022 It was the answer to the question I\u0027d been asked for 15 years: Why would anyone join a cult? How can people fall for such extremism? Growing up in the Children of God, which was a pedophile cult, it was perfectly understandable how it happened, but difficult to explain to outsiders. First, let me bring this back to that common question: what is the difference between a cult and a religion? This ties into worldview. People ask this all the time, and I say they\u0027re not even the same type of thing. A religion is an idea, a noun. A cult is a group. You need a group, even if it\u0027s just two people. One of the most pernicious stereotypes is that cults are religious. Every day I see people saying, \u0022Nah, not a cult, because we\u0027re not religious.\u0022 Part of why NXIVM fooled so many people is because it wasn\u0027t religious. Large group awareness training, like est or anything ending in \u0022-ony,\u0022 aren\u0027t religious but can still be cults. A cult doesn\u0027t give you a religion; it gives you a worldview. The leader spends decades forming this worldview, and to be a member, you must adopt it. It\u0027s not presented that way, but it becomes clear once you\u0027re in it. The entire worldview is upheld by the sacred assumption. In the Children of God, it was that this random white dude who failed at everything was the prophet of God. As long as you believe that, you can justify anything. The sacred assumption ties closely to the \u0022ends justify the means\u0022 mentality and sometimes even precipitates an apocalyptic mindset. **Scot Loyd:** The sacred assumption doesn\u0027t necessarily have to be theological in nature. It could be anything related to life, like pursuing wealth, status, or power. That\u0027s what a lot of these groups offer \u2013 a world change, a fulfilling life, or a flourishing existence. **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Right. In NXIVM, the sacred assumption was that Keith Raniere was the smartest man on earth. In the US Army, the sacred assumption is that the US flag is worth dying for. You must believe that to be successful in the Army. So, it doesn\u0027t have to be religious. It\u0027s a worldview. I\u0027ve recently realized all cults and cult leaders promise \u0022space travel,\u0022 meaning ultimate enlightenment or achievement will be on another plane, another existence, another life, a different heavenly body \u2013 something that can\u0027t be proven. This keeps people from achieving enlightenment because if it were real, they\u0027d leave. It\u0027s a crucial part of the con and makes it hard to crack people\u0027s brainwashing. As long as you choose to believe the sacred assumption, you can justify anything. **Scot Loyd:** When you talk about this sacred assumption or worldview, it reminds me of Aristotle\u0027s idea that to be persuasive, you need parts of your message that are familiar and parts that are novel. If it\u0027s all novelty, people are likely to reject it. But if there\u0027s something familiar at the core, it resonates with people. Cult leaders leverage these familiar sacred assumptions that people are already familiar with to control their thoughts and behavior. **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Yes, and I think this is exactly what Taylor Swift means when she says, \u0022You know how to ball, I know Aristotle.\u0022 She\u0027s dropping lines because she knows how to pull emotional strings. Cult leaders know how to manipulate you by leveraging these familiar concepts. I don\u0027t agree with the stereotype that cult leaders start off good and then turn bad. Cult leaders don\u0027t trip and fall into coercive control. They\u0027ve been figuring this out for a long time. For example, Jim Jones was studying how to manipulate people with preacher voice from a young age. He never cared about civil rights; it was just his way to stand out. This is why religion is often used \u2013 it\u0027s a pre-existing worldview with a giant body of literature and concepts that a cult leader can tweak and spin to fit their agenda. They use these frameworks to radicalize people. Religions have thought-stopping clich\u00E9s built in, where at some point, logic ceases, and you go forward on faith. Nefarious leaders who have been honing their manipulative skills know how to use that. **Scot Loyd:** Right. And the thought-stopping clich\u00E9 is, \u0022God told me to do this.\u0022 When someone plays that card, how do you come back from it? You don\u0027t. There\u0027s nothing you can say if they claim to have heard from God. Cult leaders play on these collective questions we all have about origin, destiny, meaning, morality, and purpose. They offer answers with certainty, enthusiasm, and passion. The human dynamic often makes us fall in line and not question these sacred assumptions. **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Absolutely. And deconstruction tip, Scot, can you repeat that list? We need to make sure this is in the show notes. **Scot Loyd:** Sure. The list is origin (where did I come from?), destiny (where am I going?), meaning (what does it all mean?), morality (how do we treat one another?), and purpose (what should I do with my life?). **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** These are the huge questions you have to define for yourself when you leave a cult. You\u0027re rejecting a worldview. My three-part model of deconstruction is: first, wake up and physically and mentally leave the cult; second, spend about a decade understanding why you were in a cult and its impact on your personality and identity; and third, move forward with no models. It\u0027s overwhelming because you\u0027ve lost your framework and have to answer these giant questions. This is why we\u0027re at risk of cult-hopping afterward, looking for another system with black-and-white rules. I fell into CrossFit and paleo for a while because I was looking for another system to live by. **Scot Loyd:** I\u0027ve experienced that too. My deconstruction is still ongoing. I left the United Pentecostal Church in a slow fade. I went through stages of cult-hopping, embracing different theological perspectives, and coming to terms with the idea that I was exceptional. I had to realize that if I\u0027m special, that\u0027s something I define for myself. Likely, I\u0027m just like everyone else, trying to make it through life and determine what is good, how to treat one another, and how to get along. The sacred assumption regulates behavior, but we need autonomy over our lives. **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Exactly, Scot. We build these stories to control behavior. Classic fairy tales were scary to keep children safe. The stories we tell ourselves are critical to how we act and operate. One thing to watch out for is groups with anti-gossip policies. Gossip helps us warn each other about bad actors. These stories and worldviews are crucial, and it\u0027s not as simple as discarding them. It takes a decade or more to build your own worldview after leaving a cult. We need to understand why we were in a cult and its impact on our identity before building our worldview. **Scot Loyd:** Yes, like you, I was born into the United Pentecostal Church and invested a large part of my life in it. Education was my way out. One of the most fascinating books I read early on was Foucault\u0027s *Discipline and Punish*, about the evolution of prisons. He opens with an assassin trying to kill King Louis XVI. The public execution made people rebel, so prisons were designed to regulate behavior. The panopticon\u0027s design, where prisoners think they\u0027re being watched 24/7, became a model for schools and hospitals. It\u0027s a beautiful analogy for high-control groups. The sacred assumption regulates behavior, dictating every aspect of life. **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Yes, and military deployment is like a prison sentence in many ways. Initially, it\u0027s nice not to have to handle daily tasks, but eventually, you crave autonomy. People want clarity, which cults provide during social confusion. Recording my audiobook made me realize culty things about myself 20 years after leaving the cult. I had to audition for the audiobook and was convinced only I could do it. When I got the offer, I was paralyzed with fear, needing professional validation. This made me realize I had been seeking a mentor to tell me what to do with my life, which isn\u0027t a mentor; it\u0027s a leader. **Scot Loyd:** Exactly, Daniella. I still seek validation and apologize for everything, a holdover from conditioning in the United Pentecostal Church. The sacred assumption gives us something to aspire to, standing in for the leader\u0027s gaze. It\u0027s terrifying to make decisions on your own, but we\u0027re all just trying to figure out how to live our one life. Your book, *Uncultured*, was your way of making your pain meaningful, helping others with their journeys. Realizing we\u0027re not as different or special as we think is a poignant part of deconstruction. **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Yes, and the realization that we\u0027re all in this together, without sacred assumptions keeping us apart, is crucial. Leaders proclaiming sacred assumptions discourage questions. Offering certainty in a volatile world is appealing but unrealistic. Sacred assumptions offer a selfish worldview, ignoring global perspectives. When you see an \u0022us vs. them\u0022 mentality, question it. It\u0027s built into cult language, with groups claiming moral superiority. **Scot Loyd:** Absolutely. Cult leaders use familiar values and frameworks to radicalize people. Your Ten Commandments for good groups, like holding nothing sacred, counteract this. Values can be manipulated; it\u0027s the reporting you require that shows true values. For example, if safety is a company\u0027s stated value, but they focus on loss numbers, they\u0027re not prioritizing safety. **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Exactly. And to preempt trolls who say, \u0022not holding anything sacred\u0022 is my sacred assumption \u2013 approaching beliefs with skepticism is essential. I show this in *Uncultured* at a soldier\u0027s funeral, holding doubt that our side is 100% right. General McChrystal\u0027s book, *Leaders: Myth and Reality*, emphasizes that soldiers must admit they don\u0027t know for sure they\u0027re on the side of right. **Scot Loyd:** And this idea of binary thinking \u2013 right vs. wrong, good vs. bad \u2013 is problematic. Our lives are shaped by luck and circumstances. The arrogance of assuming we\u0027re right and others are wrong is staggering. Living humbly means recognizing the complexities and uncertainties of life. **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Yes, deconstruction is about becoming less narcissistic and more selfish in a healthy way. Recognizing privilege and the accident of birth is crucial. There\u0027s no meritocracy; success isn\u0027t guaranteed by doing everything right. Grasping sacred assumptions is a con. **Scot Loyd:** Well said, Daniella. On that note, we\u0027ll conclude this fascinating conversation.

      "title": "Episode Two: From Charisma to Control: Understanding Cult Leaders",
      "description": "In this episode of \u0022Cults and the Culting of America,\u0022 hosts Scot Loyd and Daniella Mestyanek Young delve into the concept of charismatic leadership within cults. They begin by discussing how the idea of a charismatic leader is often associated with cults, highlighting that many of these leaders are typically perceived as white males. Daniella explains that while cults have been largely defined by white western academics, the underlying structure of patriarchy predates even white supremacy and capitalism, making it a fundamental aspect of coercive control in cults. The conversation touches on notable examples of charismatic leaders, including Keith Raniere, David Berg, and Jim Jones, as well as Elizabeth Holmes and Adam Neumann. Daniella emphasizes that charismatic authority is not just about charm but involves qualities that make people grant these leaders extraordinary influence. She discusses how these leaders often transition from being charismatic figures to being deified by their followers, creating a system where their personal mythology becomes integral to the group\u0027s identity. Scot and Daniella explore the psychological and social mechanisms that make individuals susceptible to charismatic leaders. They discuss the concept of \u0022front-of-the-room advantage,\u0022 where the mere act of being in a position of authority can make a person seem more credible and likable. They also highlight the role of rhetoric and persuasive communication in enhancing a leader\u0027s influence, noting how leaders use techniques like \u0022trance talk\u0022 to captivate and manipulate their audience. The episode concludes with a discussion on the importance of critical thinking and diverse social connections in protecting oneself from falling prey to cult-like influence. Daniella shares her \u0022guru gotcha\u0022 checklist, a tool she developed to help identify potential red flags in leaders and groups. Both hosts stress the need for self-awareness and skepticism, encouraging listeners to examine the charismatic leaders in their lives critically. They also preview upcoming episodes, including an exploration of the role of the \u0022skinny white woman\u0022 in cult dynamics and the broader impact of group psychology on individual behavior. **Keywords**: cult, cult leader, people, charismatic leader, leader, purity, call, Daniella, woman, rhetoric, groups, skinny, idea, charisma, religion, white, followers, book, white male, life Transcript: **Speaker 1**: This is Cults and the Culting of America, a podcast with scholar of cults, extreme groups, and extremely bad leadership, Daniella Mestyanek Young. **Scot Loyd**: Welcome to Cults and the Culting of America podcast. I\u0027m Scot Loyd, along with my friend Daniella Mestyanek Young. Daniella, how are you today? **Daniella**: Doing good! I\u0027m excited to talk about charismatic leadership because everybody gets confused by this one. **Scot**: Did I get \u0022Mestyanek\u0022 right this time? **Daniella**: Yes, you did. Very good. **Scot**: You were telling me during your time in the army that there were some gentlemen who were actually afraid to mispronounce it. **Daniella**: Yeah, I always joke that people thought I was so scary because, in the army, that\u0027s how you have to present yourself if you\u0027re a woman. People were so scared of me that everyone just learned how to pronounce Mestyanek. It wasn\u0027t until my very last unit that people started calling me Captain M, which would be more normal in the US military when you have a complicated name. **Scot**: Nice. My name is Scot Loyd, a little less complicated\u2014one T and one L. I like to joke that my family couldn\u0027t afford the extra consonants. But here we are today, and I\u0027m thrilled that all of you are along for the ride. Last time we were together, Daniella, we unpacked a little bit about your 10 characteristics of a cult. The first one on that list is something that, if you asked people what they associate with a cult or a cult group, they would come up with: the charismatic leader. So, what do we need to understand about the charismatic leader\u0027s role in a cult? And am I wrong to assume that most of these charismatic leaders are white males? **Daniella**: First of all, the acknowledgment that cults have been largely defined by white academics, white western academics. When we actually start looking at what we\u0027re really talking about\u2014when individuals come under the coercive control of a group\u2014those leaders can look like a lot of things. But the OG cult system, even before white supremacy and capitalism, is patriarchy. Coercive control, the way we see it in our world, is tacked right along patriarchy. We\u0027ll talk about this in next week\u0027s episode on the \u0022skinny white woman\u0022 who\u0027s in parentheses next to the cult leader in white-led American cults. When women are the cult leaders, as happened in my cult, Children of God, they still have to fight patriarchy, so they have to fight harder, and society celebrates more when they go down. In my charismatic leader chapter in my forthcoming book, *The Culting of America*, we are looking at your typical white male cult leaders you think of\u2014Keith Raniere, David Berg of Children of God, Jim Jones of Jonestown. We\u0027re also looking at Elizabeth Holmes of Theranos, David Petraeus of the military, and Adam Neumann of WeWork. Elizabeth Holmes is an example of someone who still had to fight harder to build her cult and maintain control than a man would have. She had to have a man next to her giving her validity, and society really celebrates much harder when she goes down and demands justice in ways they don\u0027t for men like Adam Neumann, who walked away with billions of dollars while she walked away with a jail sentence. **Scot**: And that\u0027s interesting when we talk about the idea of charisma, especially in the context of the United States. For a large part of my career, I served as a communications professor. One of the subjects I taught every semester was group dynamics and leadership, where we looked at how a group develops. What do we look at when we define the term leadership? In a cult or cultish-like group, these characteristics become magnified and are leveraged to manipulate others for harm. How do we define charisma? For a long time in the United States, if you were taller than everyone else, that was defined as charisma. Think of Abraham Lincoln, right? **Daniella**: The first problem is there are two things that charisma means, and we only think of one of them. We almost always think charisma equals charming, and also tall. It is true that more CEOs are tall. Taylor Swift is very tall. People always tell me I have tall energy when they realize I\u0027m only five-five. I think it\u0027s this larger-than-life thing. But the reality is, when we are saying charismatic leader, we\u0027re talking about charismatic authority. Max Weber defined this concept. He secularized something he saw from religion: we give people authority over us due to some qualities, some extra-human, extraordinary qualities they have. He defines two types of authority: power and violence authority, and charismatic authority. In any situation where you are given power because of qualities about you, that job, that degree, you are in a position of charismatic authority. It\u0027s not just charm. Cult leaders often are not charming. A lot of times, they\u0027re bumbling idiots, but they\u0027re good at traits we associate with charm and charisma in our minds. For example, something called trance talk\u2014saying a bunch of interesting-sounding, smart-sounding things, jumping from topic to topic. In *The Vow*, you see Keith Raniere doing this. People don\u0027t catch on. By the way, ask me what my secret was when I didn\u0027t know how to answer essay questions in college. My secret was to write three more paragraphs. The professor will forget you didn\u0027t actually answer the question. That\u0027s what cult leaders do. They eventually start turning themselves from charismatic leaders into gods. That\u0027s when we see people emulating their qualities, celebrating their birthdays like a holiday. **Scot**: And it\u0027s a very predictable road to deification as well. I\u0027m laughing because that was common for me growing up in the United Pentecostal Church. The leader of the church, our pastor, who was exclusively a white male, was always venerated. His birthday was celebrated, any special days for the pastoral family. Evangelicals even have Pastor Appreciation Month in October. If you were a good parishioner, you were supposed to laud all these accolades, gifts, money, and vacations on your leader. **Daniella**: We also see the mythologizing of the leader\u0027s origin story or the group\u0027s origin story. For example, I have two college degrees, and at no point did I know who the president of the university was until I had to meet him because I was the valedictorian. Why do you need to know who the leader of Bob Jones University is? When you start seeing pictures of the leader everywhere\u2014US military looking right at you\u2014that\u0027s part of deification and the weapon of likability and familiarity. We are friendlier towards people we are familiar with. When you walk in every morning and see your commander\u0027s face on the wall, they become more charismatic to you, and you are more likely to feel warmly toward them when you actually see them. It\u0027s why we think it\u0027s appropriate to walk up to an actress or actor in real life and introduce ourselves. We feel like we know them and love them because of that familiarity. These patterns are not original. Dr. Janja Lalich says they all went to the same Messiah school. **Scot**: You bring up exceptionalism. Not only does the leader think they are exceptional, but cult leaders play with terms like destiny and fate. Destiny has a wonderful connotation; everyone wants to embrace their destiny and avoid their fate. Cult leaders create a negative fate like hell or some version of hell\u2014poverty, unpopularity, loneliness. They create their version of heaven and say, \u0022Follow me, and you\u0027ll fulfill your destiny and avoid this fate.\u0022 **Daniella**: Yes, and with the destiny thing, they always blame individuals for systemic problems. If anything good happens, it\u0027s the cult or the leader. If anything bad happens, it\u0027s you. This trains you to think this way. I realized that cult leaders often promise something in another life, world, plane, body, or state. You can\u0027t reach enlightenment because it\u0027s a con. The cult leader knows it\u0027s a con. It\u0027s significant that Jim Jones didn\u0027t drink the Kool-Aid; he died from a bullet to the head. Cult leaders get caught up in their own hullabaloo, but their followers believe in the ends justifying the means. The cult leader knows the whole time. When we look back at all those cult leaders, we can see that since childhood, they are manipulating, building their worldview, and trying to build something with a following. **Scot**: Cult leaders exploit the need within all of us to think of ourselves as exceptional, to think our lives have meaning and purpose. The loudest and most bold among us are often the most insecure. Human nature makes us follow loud, bold people, especially if they promise purpose and meaning. They also have the stick of punishment\u2014eternal damnation, poverty, loneliness. Follow them, and you\u0027ll avoid this fate. **Daniella**: Right, I call it the front-of-the-room advantage. When you\u0027re in an audience and hear someone introduced as the speaker, you think they\u0027re impressive. I teach veterans in my networking classes to put themselves in front of the mic as often as they can. People will believe someone put them there. If nobody else is questioning around you, that\u0027s social proof. Cult leaders rely on this heavily. They\u0027ll flabbergast you and keep going. If nobody else is saying anything, you think it must be okay. When we started studying cults, we believed humans were much more rational than they are. \u0022I think, therefore I am,\u0022 like Ren\u00E9 Descartes really screws us over a bit. Humans are not rational; we hardly ever make decisions based on logic. We make most of our decisions based on recency bias and social proof. What worked for us most recently or what everyone else around us is doing. These evolutionary drives keep you alive. This comes into play with the charismatic leader. Some bigger cults have been through a thing called routinization. Mormons and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses will say, \u0022We\u0027re not a cult; no charismatic leader.\u0022 If you have to use a loophole to get out of the definition of a cult, we have an answer now, and it\u0027s called charisma by proxy. We now know large groups of people can go down illogical paths without calling each other out on it. **Scot**: There\u0027s a good resource that unpacks that further\u2014*The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Disagree About Religion and Politics* by Jonathan Haidt, a moral psychologist. One of the best books I\u2019ve read on this. In public speaking, I tell my students, \u0022With great power comes great responsibility.\u0022 Public speaking is the number one fear in America. Seinfeld joked people would rather be in the box at a funeral than give the eulogy. But if you manage that apprehension, you set yourself apart. For our listeners, to make students less susceptible to cults, get them involved in debate. It\u2019s a great activity. You can\u0027t rely solely on charismatic skills; logic is involved. It takes you out of the binary world and helps you see all possibilities. High control groups want you locked into binary thinking\u2014\u0022my way or hell.\u0022 **Daniella**: The first thing anyone will say if you call a group they love a cult is, \u0022Not a cult, free to leave anytime.\u0022 That line is both loaded language and a thought-stopping clich\u00E9. It\u0027s not true. Cults have high entrance and exit costs\u2014not always money. It\u0027s anything you lose if you\u0027re not in the group. In both the cult and the military I grew up in, leaders would say, \u0022This is not a democracy.\u0022 You are reminded everything you have can be gone if you disagree. People say, \u0022Oh, you\u0027re free to leave anytime.\u0022 I say, \u0022Do you love everything about your job? No? Why don\u0027t you just leave?\u0022 **Scot**: Exactly. When we talk about charisma and the charismatic leader, I thought about good questions to ask if evaluating whether a leader is a cult leader. These are good questions for any leader. One is, what platform of privilege are they speaking from that gives them this advantage? In our society, patriarchy and white supremacy give white males a place of status. The system was produced by people like me, a white male, for my benefit. It\u0027s important to acknowledge that. If your leader isn\u2019t doing that, maybe that\u2019s a problem. **Daniella**: Social media has been good for cult leaders. It helps people get into and out of cults. I say that in the 60s and 70s, when my grandfather joined the Children of God, if you wanted to isolate an American citizen, you had to take them away to your compound in Texas or Brazil because we all watched the same TV shows, listened to the same news. Even if you were on polar opposite sides of an issue, you shared this reality. These days, isolation can just be in your bedroom on a computer, and you can totally be in a cult. It has shifted things. I built a \u0022guru gotcha\u0022 checklist to keep myself in check. Anybody who knows a lot about cult leaders and bad guys is dangerous. People say, \u0022Should we be scared of you?\u0022 Yes, if I invite you to my compound, maybe say no. I fought the social media thing because I don\u0027t like the concept of influencers. I make sure 50% of my content comes from others. I want people to see that. Here\u0027s the \u0022guru gotcha\u0022 checklist: 1. Heavy focus on your own uniqueness. 2. Intense come-here-go-away behavior to keep you off balance. 3. Always asking you to prove your loyalty. 4. Lack of intellectual humility or willingness to learn from others. 5. Constantly blurring the edges of their expertise. 6. Trance talk. 7. Asking followers to pay for their essence, presence, or energy. 8. Handing out life advice they are not qualified to give. 9. Some form of purity from their followers. 10. Intense appearance and attitude control of followers. 11. Talking poorly about other leaders in their industry. 12. Blaming systemic failures on individual action. 13. Blurred sexual boundaries or using young women or men to entice followers. 14. Requesting followers to leave their jobs and follow them. 15. Threatens you when you leave or speak poorly of them. **Scot**: That\u2019s a lot to talk about. Let\u0027s return to purity and power. Growing up in the United Pentecostal Church, purity and power were hallmarks. Policing behavior, dress, and hairstyles of women were emphasized. It was steeped in white supremacy. The skinny white woman was the ideal image. Purity was about maintaining the look of the 1930s and 1940s\u2014no jewelry, no makeup, no cutting hair. This was preached as giving power and authority with angels and God. **Daniella**: Purity requirements are in every situation of coercive control. They\u2019re not just sexual purity but any black-and-white rule. I explain it like this: I don\u0027t eat wheat because I\u0027m allergic to it, so it\u0027s a black-and-white rule but not a purity requirement. Groups that don\u0027t eat gluten for health are under purity. Purity requirements are crucial because they make people police each other and themselves. They are impossible because humans are bad at being perfect and pure. Cult leaders themselves never follow purity requirements. They are for everyone else. They turn you into your own jailer. Purity requirements are usually time-consuming and keep you busy. Skinny is a powerful purity requirement in our society. It\u2019s a visual presentation of sacrifice. **Scot**: Speaking of purity culture, in the United Pentecostal Church, there was a big emphasis on women\u0027s behavior and bodies. There wasn\u2019t that emphasis for men. You shared part of your story in *Uncultured*\u2014a sex cult. How did the leaders reconcile purity culture? **Daniella**: In the Children of God, the purity requirement was you couldn\u2019t say no. You were not trusting God if you said no. You were letting your individuality and desires interfere. There was a comic called \u0022The Girl Who Wouldn\u2019t\u0022 training us from a young age. Outside the cult, I didn\u2019t know how to say no. Purity requirements in the Children of God involved no underwear while sleeping, women not wearing bras. Skinny is one of the most powerful purity requirements. Cult leaders want to keep you isolated, tired, busy, skinny, pregnant, and hungry. Sometimes it\u2019s the opposite of skinny. Scientology forced abortions. Heaven\u2019s Gate had no sex, no children. It\u2019s about controlling sex, not purity. Any organization telling consenting adults who they can and can\u2019t sleep with is controlling. **Scot**: I appreciate you sharing that. Let\u2019s return to the idea of rhetoric. Charismatic leaders harness rhetoric\u0027s power. Hitler is a classic example, although his style of speaking seems like just yelling. Symbolic Convergence Theory by Ernest Bormann from the University of Minnesota theorizes that people develop and move forward around ideas communicated effectively by leaders. These rhetorical visions organize and control civilization. How is a rhetorical vision cast in cults, and how do we insulate ourselves from falling prey? **Daniella**: I love *Sapiens* by Yuval Noah Harari. Religions, corporations, organizations\u2014all these groups are stories we tell ourselves. Religions are stories societies craft to explain things. Cults are not religions; they are cons from day one. Elizabeth Holmes knew she wasn\u2019t transforming blood testing. Cults are about the leader\u2019s control. Religions aim for society to work; cults don\u2019t. Religions are not comparable to cults. Religions are useful to cult leaders because they require faith, which can be manipulated. **Scot**: Manipulation vs. motivation is a key difference. Motivation is mutually beneficial; manipulation benefits only the leader. Consensual sales involve providing actual products that help people. Manipulations involve false promises. Understanding this helps identify manipulation. **Daniella**: Anyone who knows about cult leaders can become one. Wake up every day and choose to use your rhetorical skills for good, not to manipulate. Jim Jones could have been remembered as an early civil rights leader if he died in the 1950s. Instead, he chose to use his skills for evil. Charismatic leaders must choose daily to use their influence for good. **Scot**: Engaging in competitive debate helps build critical thinking. It challenges prevailing assumptions and teaches you to look at other positions. If you\u2019re in a space where everyone agrees with you, you\u2019re susceptible to harm. Ideas must be challenged to avoid trauma. **Daniella**: Social connections are crucial. Make sure your children have diverse social connections that don\u2019t overlap. High exit costs make leaving hard. Cancel culture isn\u2019t real; it\u2019s consequence culture. Diversifying connections helps navigate challenges. Understanding your own biases and staying agnostic about being the good guy is crucial. Cults thrive on binary thinking. **Scot**: In our concluding episodes, we\u2019ll talk about the importance of groups and community. Next episode, we\u0027ll explore the role of the \u0022skinny white woman\u0022 next to the charismatic leader. **Daniella**: Thanks for listening with open minds.

I\u0027m your host, Scott Lloyd, and I\u0027m thrilled to be here with Daniella Mestyanek Young, a scholar in this field and author of the compelling memoir, \u0022Uncultured.\u0022 Daniella, how are you today? Daniella: I\u0027m doing great, Scott! Thanks for having me. Scott: Fantastic! I\u0027m excited to kick off this podcast with you. I must say, your book \u0022Uncultured\u0022 has been an incredible resource for me. Growing up in a small Pentecostal cult, known as the United Pentecostal Church, your experiences really resonated with me. Throughout our podcast, I\u0027ll share some of my own stories, but your journey from the Children of God cult to the United States Army is extraordinary. Your book provides such a detailed account, and I highly recommend everyone read it. For those who prefer audio, it\u0027s available and even made it to the New York Times bestseller list. Daniella: Thank you so much, Scott. I\u0027m glad to hear the book has had such an impact. Scott: For our listeners who might not be familiar with your story, could you share a bit about your experiences? We\u2019re titling this episode \u0022Patriot Pains: I Joined the Army and All I Got Was This Lousy Trauma,\u0022 and I\u2019m particularly interested in how you compare your time in the Children of God cult with your service in the Army. Daniella: Absolutely. First, I want to clarify that while the media often labels the Children of God as a \u0022sex cult,\u0022 it\u0027s important to understand that cults, in general, share common patterns of behavior and control, regardless of their specific doctrines. That said, the Children of God did have a significant focus on sexual doctrines, which were central to their beliefs. I was born into the Children of God, three generations deep. My family was deeply embedded in its leadership\u2014my grandmother donated the first house to the leader, David Berg, and my grandfather still manages the cult\u0027s finances. My father also played a significant role in handling the money. This is all detailed in my book, \u0022Uncultured.\u0022 The Children of God started in 1968 in California, like many cults of that era. David Berg took evangelical control of sex, mixed it with elements of Mormonism, and called it \u0022free love,\u0022 which I describe as forced polyamory. The cult rebranded itself over the years\u2014from being labeled a \u0022harem photo sex cult\u0022 on the cover of Time Magazine in the 80s to performing at the White House in the 90s. Scott: Wow, that\u2019s a remarkable transformation. Daniella: Yes, it is. But despite the rebranding, the core practices and control mechanisms remained the same. I was eventually kicked out at 15, and as you\u2019ll see throughout this podcast, I was never someone who would conform to that environment. Scott: Your transition from the Children of God to the Army is fascinating. How did you end up comparing the two environments? Daniella: There are surprising similarities between extreme groups, whether it\u0027s a cult or a highly structured organization like the Army. Both environments use intense control and indoctrination techniques, which can be quite traumatic. My story is about navigating these systems and finding my own path. Scott: This is going to be an enlightening conversation. Thank you for sharing, Daniella. Let\u0027s dive into more of your experiences and insights.",

I\u0027m your host, Scott Lloyd, and I\u0027m here with Daniella Mestyanek Young, a scholar of cults, extreme groups, and extremely bad leadership. Daniella, how are you today? Daniella: I\u0027m doing great, Scott! How about you? Scot: I\u0027m good, thanks! I see you\u2019ve been super busy lately. Every time I open Instagram or TikTok, you\u2019re going live. How do you manage to talk so much from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.? Daniella: (Laughs) It\u0027s funny you mention that. When recording the audiobook for \u0022Uncultured,\u0022 I discovered I have no trouble talking for seven to nine hours a day. While others worry about losing their voice, that wasn\u2019t the hard part for me. Right now, I\u2019m talking to a lot of people about cults, which are a hot topic these days. Historically, cults thrive during times of societal change because people crave clarity and leadership. Scot: That makes sense, given everything going on. Your book, \u0022Uncultured,\u0022 is fantastic and really sheds light on your experiences growing up in the Children of God cult and later joining the Army. I recently moved to Springfield, Illinois, and saw your book featured as a must-read at Barnes \u0026 Noble. Congrats on all the success! Daniella: Thank you so much! I love seeing those photos of \u0022Uncultured\u0022 in the wild. I appreciate the introduction. As you mentioned, I grew up in the Children of God cult, which is one of the worst you\u2019ll hear about on this podcast. I later joined the U.S. Army and earned a master\u0027s degree in Industrial/Organizational Psychology from Harvard Extension School. Now, I\u2019m a scholar of cults, extreme groups, and extremely bad leadership. I compare what I do to an intelligence officer\u0027s work, helping people understand group behavior and recognize cult tactics in everyday life. Scot: Absolutely. Your book has been a great resource in understanding my own experiences with the United Pentecostal Church, which had many cult-like behaviors, especially in policing the bodies of women. These groups often use appearance and attitude policing to control individuals, stripping away their individuality. Daniella: Exactly. Cults exist for labor and control, using predictable patterns of coercive control. Appearance and attitude policing are key tactics. We\u2019ll discuss this more in our episode on self-sacrifice, but the goal is always to erase the individual for the group\u2019s or leader\u2019s benefit. Scot: That loss of individualism is a common thread in many cults and extreme groups. For example, in the Pentecostal church, the exuberant worship practices often lead to a collective loss of self, making individuals more susceptible to groupthink and control. Daniella: Yes, chanting and group activities make us highly susceptible to suggestion. It\u2019s a common tactic in cults and other controlling environments. We\u2019ll explore this further in the podcast, breaking down my 10-part definition of cults and comparing these tactics to behaviors in everyday groups and systems. Scot: I\u2019m thrilled about this podcast and the opportunity to learn from you. Why do you think cults are such a hot topic right now? Daniella: America is going through significant societal changes, similar to the 70s. People are seeking clarity and community, making them more vulnerable to cults. Additionally, we\u2019re revisiting social issues and questioning longstanding systems like patriarchy, racism, and capitalism. Cult tactics are everywhere, and it\u2019s crucial to recognize them to navigate these systems better. Scot: Well said. This podcast aims to educate and help people understand the toxic elements in groups and systems. I invite everyone to join us on this journey.
