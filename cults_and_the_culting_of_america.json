      "description": "In this episode of Cults and the Culting of America, Daniella Mestyanek Young and Scot Loyd are joined by hip-hop artist, author, and activist Spryte the Emcee, who shares her deeply personal journey through addiction, recovery, and eventual deconstruction from Narcotics Anonymous. Spryte recounts a childhood shaped by trauma, loss, and instability, followed by immersion in NA after a near-fatal overdose. While the program initially provided safety and structure, it later became increasingly coercive and controlling, particularly when Spryte pursued higher education and personal growth. The conversation explores how high-control dynamics mirror those found in religious cults and the military: rigid hierarchies, fear-based retention, conditional community, and the prioritization of the institution over individual wellbeing. Spryte describes being discouraged from trauma-informed therapy, pressured into unpaid labor, silenced after reporting sexual assault, and threatened with relapse and death when she chose to leave. Daniella and Scot contextualize these experiences within broader patterns of cult behavior, emphasizing that lifesaving support and systemic harm can coexist. Together, the hosts and guest examine exit costs, the myth of unconditional community, and why institutions react so aggressively when former members tell their stories. The episode underscores the importance of autonomy, access to outside information, and the courage required to reclaim one\u0027s narrative after leaving a high-control group.

Conditional community is a major red flag\u2014support often disappears once someone leaves. Trauma-informed therapy, not ideology, was key to Spryte\u0027s long-term healing. Institutions often react more strongly to members leaving than to harm happening within the group. Reporting abuse inside high-control groups is frequently discouraged or actively suppressed. Fear-based narratives about life \u0022outside\u0022 are used to prevent people from leaving. Hierarchies, tokens, ranks, and longevity are used to enforce conformity and obedience. Telling one\u0027s story threatens institutions more than it threatens individuals. True recovery and growth require autonomy, not lifelong submission to a system.

      "description": "In this episode of Cults and the Culting of America, Daniella sits down with political scientist Thomas Kelly to revisit one of the most foundational ideas in cult studies: cognitive dissonance. Their conversation centers on Leon Festinger\u0027s famous book When Prophecy Fails, which is often cited to explain why cult members double down on beliefs after predictions don\u0027t come true. Thomas walks through his research uncovering serious methodological and ethical problems with that original study, arguing that the historical record actually shows the opposite of what Festinger claimed. Rather than reinforcing belief, failed prophecy most often leads to attrition, disillusionment, and collapse. Together, Daniella and Thomas explore why this misunderstanding has shaped decades of cult research, how survivor voices were sidelined during the \u0022cult wars,\u0022 and why failed prophecies tend to wound groups far more than scholars once believed. The discussion expands into broader questions about coercive control, survivor testimony, ethical research methods, media involvement, and why people want prophecies to come true. The episode ultimately challenges listeners to rethink how we explain belief, persistence, and exit in high-control groups\u2014and to be more skeptical of tidy psychological theories that ignore lived experience.

Historical evidence shows most groups do not grow stronger after failed prophecy; they fracture or dissolve. Festinger and his team interfered with the group they were studying, compromising the research. Cognitive dissonance as a concept does not stand or fall on this study, but the case should no longer be used as proof of belief \u0022doubling down.\u0022 Survivor voices were largely ignored during the development of cult scholarship, especially during the cult wars. Failed prophecy outcomes depend heavily on whether the prophecy is tied to a single charismatic authority or a broader interpretive framework (like scripture). Media attention played a significant role in shaping the cult\u0027s behavior before and after the prophecy failed. People in cults often want the prophecy to come true\u2014it represents hope, purpose, and meaning. Coercive control is better understood through tactics and dynamics than rigid definitions of \u0022cult.\u0022 Studying real-world \u0022natural experiments\u0022 may offer better insight into belief and compliance than lab psychology studies.

      "description": "In this episode, guest Ara Jade shares her seven-year experience inside a high-control religious group adjacent to the Hebrew Israelite movement, known as the Israel of God. She recounts how she was drawn in through family influence, biblical study practices, and a strong sense of community, only to later encounter manipulation, racism-based doctrine, misogyny, surveillance, fear tactics, and emotional control. Ara describes specific red flags, including purity rules for women, the weaponization of Black identity, pressure to obey male authority, and her arranged-like marriage. She explains how her awakening unfolded through personal losses, marital betrayal, and finally being dismissed by leadership when seeking protection. Ara concludes with thoughtful advice for people questioning their involvement in high-control groups, emphasizing listening to intuition, seeking outside perspectives, asking hard questions, and being gentle with oneself during the process of leaving and grieving.\n  Daniella\u0027s Links:\n    Preorder for Culting of America:  The Culting of America PRE-SALE (SHIPS BY JANUARY 20, 2026) \u2013 Knitting Cult Lady\n   Daniella Mestyanek Young\u0027s book:\u00A0\n    From Bookshop.org\n    Uncultured  Autographed:\n     Connect with Daniella on social media\u00A0\n    TikTok   Patreon   Instagram   Youtube    Other Podcasts\n   Daniella\u0027s other podcast:  Hey White Women\n   Scot\u0027s Socials\n  TikTok:\u00A0  @thescotloyd\n Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/@thescotloyd\n Haley\u0027s Tiktok\n @nuancedmasculinities\n Key Takeaways   The Israel of God mirrored Hebrew Israelite theology but distanced itself publicly while maintaining similar doctrines.\n   Black identity and biblical narratives were used to create belonging while simultaneously controlling members.\n   Fear-based teachings (hell, end times, impurity) played a key role in keeping members obedient.\n   Women were subjected to strict purity laws, gender hierarchy, and were often treated as property for marriage.\n   The community structure relied heavily on surveillance, gossip, and punitive social consequences.\n   Ara experienced pressure to marry men she did not choose, reflecting the group\u0027s patriarchal control.\n   Her father leaving the group, her grandmother passing away, and her husband\u0027s infidelity created a tipping point.\n   Church leaders minimized abuse, discouraged outside help, and expected spiritual authority over personal safety.\n   Leaving the group resulted in shunning but also clarity and relief.\n   Ara encourages listeners to trust gut feelings, seek outside information, and allow themselves compassion while exiting.\n   Missing aspects of the community after leaving is normal and part of healing.\n   Chapters\n 00:00 Introduction to Ara Jade\u0027s Journey\n 03:08 Understanding Hebrew Israelites and Their Beliefs\n 05:43 Ara\u0027s Experience with the Israel of God\n 08:33 Initial Attraction and Community Building\n 11:12 Red Flags and Cognitive Dissonance\n 13:56 The Weaponization of Fear and Control\n 16:30 Identity Stripping and Community Dynamics\n 18:54 The Role of Forgiveness in Manipulation\n 27:14 The Toxic Environment of the Cult\n 29:50 Questioning Beliefs and Doctrines\n 35:02 The Impact of Relationships and Marriage\n 39:32 Realizations and Leaving the Cult\n 46:12 Advice for Others in Similar Situations\n Produced by Haley Phillips, Meghan Picmann, and Lizy Freudmann",

      "description": "This episode of Cults and the Culting of America features guest Emily Hulen, a massage therapist and trauma coach who grew up in Christian Science and later navigated additional cult-like environments. Emily describes the core beliefs of Christian Science \u2014 including the denial of physical reality, rejection of medical care, and heavy reliance on prayer as a means of erasing mortal experience. She shares harrowing examples of untreated medical issues in her family and her own childhood injuries and illnesses that went unaddressed.\n Emily traces her early cognitive dissonance, beginning around age ten, as she started comparing Christian Science ideas with Greek mythology and noticing inconsistencies. Her family\u0027s reaction to her questioning led to increased control, isolation, and punishment. She also explains overlapping dynamics of a family cult, with her mother acting as a controlling, narcissistic leader.\n Emily describes eventually leaving home, the challenges of early adulthood, and the emergence of PTSD symptoms in her romantic relationship. The episode highlights her healing journey through therapy modalities including CBT, DBT, IFS (Internal Family Systems), EMDR, and somatic work. Emily emphasizes how trauma shows up physically, how therapy helped her reclaim a sense of self, and how she now helps others through trauma-informed bodywork and coaching.\n Daniella and Scott connect Emily\u0027s experiences to broader patterns across cults and high-control systems (including the military), highlighting shared mechanisms such as intense rhetoric, personal blame, dissociation, and thought-terminating clich\u00E9s. The episode closes with information about Emily\u0027s work and her perspective on reclaiming identity after trauma.\n Emily\u0027s Links:\n https://www.holisticechoes.com\n Contact: emily@holisticechoes.com\n  Daniella\u0027s Links:\n    Preorder for Culting of America:  The Culting of America PRE-SALE (SHIPS BY JANUARY 20, 2026) \u2013 Knitting Cult Lady\n   Daniella Mestyanek Young\u0027s book:\u00A0\n    From Bookshop.org\n    Uncultured  Autographed:\n     Connect with Daniella on social media\u00A0\n    TikTok   Patreon   Instagram   Youtube    Other Podcasts\n   Daniella\u0027s other podcast:  Hey White Women\n   Scot\u0027s Socials\n  TikTok:\u00A0  @thescotloyd\n KEY TAKEAWAYS   Christian Science denies physical reality, framing illness, injury, and even death as illusions created by \u0022mortal mind.\u0022\n   Medical neglect is common within the group; Emily and her family suffered severe, untreated medical conditions as a result.\n   Prayer functions as a \u0022window cleaning\u0022 practice \u2014 not communicating with God, but reaffirming perfection and denying suffering.\n   Children are taught to dissociate from physical experiences, creating lifelong structural dissociation patterns.\n   Emily began questioning the belief system around age ten, aided by secular homeschooling materials and internet access.\n   Her family reacted with increased control, isolation, and policing of thought, including banning books and restricting time outdoors.\n   Emily\u0027s home also functioned as a family cult, with her mother exerting authoritarian control and exploiting her children\u0027s labor.\n   Leaving her parents\u0027 home sparked PTSD symptoms, especially around conflict, anger, and household dynamics.\n   Trauma responses mirror old patterns, such as scanning for danger, over-responsibility, flinching, or misinterpreting neutral situations as threats.\n   Therapy \u2014 particularly IFS, EMDR, and somatic modalities \u2014 helped Emily repair trauma by meeting unmet needs and separating past from present.\n   Cult survivors often struggle with self-trust, identity, and fears of being seen as \u0022frauds.\u0022\n   Daniella and Scott note that cult dynamics and military culture share structural similarities, including high pressure, emotional suppression, and elevated rhetoric.\n   Healing involves reclaiming agency, challenging old wiring, and recognizing one\u0027s worth and capability.\n   Emily now helps others through trauma-focused bodywork and coaching, emphasizing that expertise can come from lived experience and extensive independent study.\n   Chapters\n 00:00 Introduction and Background of Emily Hulen\n 01:55 Understanding Christian Science and Its Impact\n 05:36 Personal Experiences with Medical Neglect\n 09:24 Dissociation and Cult Ideology\n 11:14 Red Flags and Awakening\n 16:02 Family Dynamics and Leaving the Cult\n 20:49 The Decline of Christian Science\n 26:40 Reflections on Healing and Moving Forward\n 28:28 The Impact of Medical Neglect in Cults\n 30:44 Healing from Cult Trauma\n 35:08 Navigating Relationships Post-Cult\n 39:44 Therapeutic Journeys and Self-Discovery\n 44:52 Integrating Past Trauma into Present Life\n 49:29 The Role of Education and Expertise in Healing\n Produced by Haley Phillips, Meghan Picmann, and Lizy Freudmann",

They examine how panic, white exceptionalism, and a lack of historical education shape public reactions to authoritarian behavior. The conversation highlights parallels between MAGA and cult structures, emphasizing how \u0022mission collapse\u0022 (such as the refusal to release the Epstein documents) destabilizes the movement.\n They explore how white Americans often misunderstand authoritarianism because they have been insulated from state violence, and how whiteness itself is a tool that can be used both to maintain oppressive systems and to dismantle them. They discuss protest strategy, noting that mass participation by everyday \u0022normies\u0022\u2014especially white women\u2014has historically been one of the few things authoritarian regimes respond to, even during Nazi Germany.\n The two discuss the limits of political institutions, the psychology of cult disengagement, and the likelihood that Trump himself will avoid legal accountability. They explore whether JD Vance would be \u0022worse,\u0022 ultimately concluding he would be more strategic but less chaotically dangerous. The episode closes with reflections on justice, narcissism, and the strange, painful reality that cult leaders often die unpunished, even as their followers suffer.\n  Amanda\u0027s Links:\n  tiktok\n  instagram\n  threads\n  youtube\n  facebook\n  Daniella\u0027s Links:\n    Preorder for Culting of America:  The Culting of America PRE-SALE (SHIPS BY JANUARY 20, 2026) \u2013 Knitting Cult Lady\n   Daniella Mestyanek Young\u0027s book:\u00A0\n    From Bookshop.org\n    Uncultured  Autographed:\n     Connect with Daniella on social media\u00A0\n    TikTok   Patreon   Instagram   Youtube    Other Podcasts\n   Daniella\u0027s other podcast:  Hey White Women\n   Scot\u0027s Socials\n  TikTok:\u00A0  @thescotloyd\n Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/@thescotloyd\n Haley\u0027s Tiktok\n @nuancedmasculinities\n Key Takeaways   Panic feels productive but is politically ineffective; organized, sustained action is what matters.\n   White American panic often reflects unfamiliarity with state violence experienced by others.\n   U.S. authoritarianism has deep historical precedents, not just recent ones.\n   Americans default to Nazi comparisons due to limited education and universal patterns of authoritarianism.\n   National exceptionalism is a major red flag for cult-like thinking.\n   White women have historically not shown up in protest movements despite their cultural protection and organizing power.\n   Regimes often back down when \u0022normies,\u0022 especially white women, show up en masse to protest.\n   MAGA operates like a cult with a charismatic leader, transcendent mission, and predictable collapse pattern.\n   Trump\u0027s refusal to release the Epstein files broke the core promise of \u0022drain the swamp,\u0022 damaging the movement\u0027s internal stability.\n   People rarely leave cults with dramatic awakenings; exits are quiet and painful.\n   White women can use their social protection to shield more vulnerable groups during protests.\n   The U.S. population size and armed citizenry make totalitarian consolidation unstable and unsustainable.\n   JD Vance would be strategically dangerous but less chaotic and impulsive than Trump.\n   Cult leaders often avoid punishment; public anticipation of their downfall may be its own form of consequence.\n   The patriarchy is deeply entrenched, but mass exposure of crimes (like Epstein files) could destabilize political power.\n   Lack of historical literacy prevents people from recognizing authoritarian patterns.\n   \u0022Normie-led\u0022 protests are historically what end authoritarian pushes.\n   The MAGA movement is fracturing due to mission collapse and internal contradictions.\n   The conversation emphasizes harm reduction rather than fantasies of quick political salvation.\n   Mass organization, not despair, is the path to meaningful opposition.\n   Chapters\n 00:00 Introduction to American History and Culture\n 02:48 Understanding Panic and Historical Precedents\n 05:52 The Role of Race and Identity in American History\n 08:32 The Puritans and American Exceptionalism\n 11:28 Xenophobia and the American Identity\n 14:06 Protests and the Role of White Women\n 17:10 The Complexity of American Values\n 19:55 Cults, Authoritarianism, and American Politics\n 22:46 The Power of Collective Action\n 25:45 Conclusion and Call to Action\n 29:42 The Role of White Allies in Activism\n 34:03 The Power of Collective Action\n 36:45 The Epstein List and Its Implications\n 41:26 The Dichotomy of Child Protection in America\n 47:47 Political Perspectives on Leadership Changes\n Produced by Haley Phillips, Meghan Picmann, and Lizy Freudmann",

Listener discretion is advised.\n\nIn this episode of Cults and the Culting of America, hosts Dr. Scot Loyd and Daniella Mestyanek Young speak with Beth Granger, author of Born and RAZED: Surviving the Cult Was Only Half the Battle. Beth shares her experience growing up at Grenville Christian College, a Canadian boarding school later revealed to be a religious cult connected to the Community of Jesus.\n\nShe describes the systematic control, emotional and physical abuse, and the long process of recovery and rediscovery that followed her escape. The conversation dives into the complexities of grief, family estrangement, and the enduring impact of coercive religious systems. Beth also discusses her role as a representative plaintiff in a landmark class-action lawsuit against the institution, and how advocacy, writing, and community have shaped her healing.\n\nThe episode ends with a reflective discussion about deconstruction, the search for meaning after leaving high-control groups, and what it means to \u201Clive with it\u201D as an adult survivor.\n\nDisclaimer:\nThis conversation is for educational and storytelling purposes only.

They compare U.S. and Brazilian political systems, the cultural myths that obscure inequality (the \u0022American Dream\u0022 vs. Brazil\u0027s \u0022racial democracy\u0022), and the interplay between religion, class, and authoritarianism. The discussion explores how political elites, class structures, and the military shaped Brazil\u0027s dictatorship and its fall, how the U.S. normalizes corruption through legality, and why Americans struggle to recognize creeping authoritarianism.

      "description": "In this episode of Cults and the Culting of America, hosts Scot Loyd and Daniella Mestyanek Young unpack Secretary of War Pete Hegseth\u2019s recent dystopian-sounding address to military leadership, examining it through the lens of cult psychology, gendered standards, and authoritarian control.\n Daniella dissects how \u201Cstandards\u201D and \u201Cprofessionalism\u201D in the military are tools to maintain patriarchal and racial hierarchies, using examples like grooming policies and \u201Cgender-neutral\u201D male standards. She argues that rhetoric like Hegseth\u2019s is part of a broader movement toward Christian nationalism and toxic militarized masculinity, dubbing it the \u201CMojo Dojo Casa Military.\u201D\n Together, they explore whether the U.S. military could ever be used against American citizens, why cult-like obedience structures are dangerous, and how individual ethics, diversity, and generational change make full-scale authoritarian control unlikely.\n The conversation then shifts toward Scot\u2019s new book, The God That I Was Given: Looking for Faith After Losing My Religion. Daniella and Scot discuss faith deconstruction, privilege, and how to hold space for both pride in one\u2019s past and critical honesty about harm. They reflect on storytelling, accountability, and how both military and religious institutions reward conformity and punish introspection.\n  Daniella\u0027s Links:\n   You can read all about my story in my book, Uncultured-- buy signed copies here.  https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\n  \u00A0\n   For more info on me:\n   Patreon:  https://bit.ly/YTPLanding\n   Cult book Clubs (Advanced AND Memoirs) Annual Membership:  https://bit.ly/YTPLanding\n   Get an autographed copy of my book, Uncultured:  https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\n   Get my book, Uncultured, from Bookshop.org:  https://bit.ly/4g1Ufw8\n   Daniella\u2019s Tiktok: Knitting Cult Lady\n   Instagram:  \u00A0https://bit.ly/4ePAOFK  / daniellamyoung_\u00A0\n   Unamerican video book (on Patreon):  https://bit.ly/YTVideoBook\n   Secret Practice video book (on Patreon):  https://bit.ly/3ZswGY8\n   Other Podcasts\n   Daniella\u0027s other podcast:  Hey White Women\n   Scot\u0027s Socials\n  TikTok:\u00A0  @thescotloyd\n Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/@thescotloyd\n Haley\u0027s Tiktok\n @nuancedmasculinities\n \uD83D\uDD11 Key Takeaways   \u201CStandards\u201D are culturally constructed \u2014 often used to uphold existing power structures under the guise of objectivity.\n   \u201CGender neutral\u201D usually means \u201Cmale\u201D \u2014 erasing femininity and reinforcing patriarchal norms.\n   Hegseth\u2019s rhetoric reflects toxic masculinity, racial dog whistles, and authoritarian nostalgia for a \u201CDepartment of War.\u201D\n   Military culture mirrors cult structures, but its guiding \u201Ccult\u201D is loyalty to the Constitution \u2014 not to any single leader.\n   Younger service members (Millennials \u0026 Gen Z) are reshaping the culture toward diversity, empathy, and critical thinking.\n   Brainwashing tactics from abusive systems and cults were deliberately baked into modern military training.\n   Deconstruction is not destruction \u2014 you can be proud of aspects of your experience while acknowledging systemic harm.\n   Both hosts connect cult dynamics across institutions \u2014 religion, the military, and politics all rely on controlling narratives.\n   Writing memoirs like Uncultured and The God That I Was Given provides a model for honest reflection that includes both pride and pain.\n   Truth-telling invites criticism, but it\u2019s vital for cultural healing and understanding.\n   Chapters\n 00:00 Introduction to the Podcast and Guests\n 00:53 Military Standards and Gender Equality\n 03:43 Rhetoric and Leadership in the Military\n 06:29 Concerns Over Military Use Against Citizens\n 09:21 Basic Training and Military Culture\n 12:08 The Role of Experience in Military Leadership\n 14:54 Political Rhetoric and Military Professionalism\n 17:51 Diversity in the Military and Its Implications\n 20:39 Public Perception and Military Loyalty\n 23:23 Historical Context of Military Orders\n 26:09 Conclusion and Future Implications\n 28:18 Generational Perspectives in the Military\n 32:50 The Culting of America: A Deeper Dive\n 37:16 Navigating Privilege and Perspective\n 41:48 The Complexity of Faith and Deconstruction\n 47:06 The Power of Storytelling and Truth\n 54:22 Closing Thoughts on Diversity and Listening\n Produced by Haley Phillips, Meghan Picmann, and Lizy Freudmann",

      "description": "In this episode of Cults and the Culting of America, hosts Daniella Mestyanek Young and Scot Loyd welcome Dr. Jo, a veterinarian from New Orleans, to explore the surprising overlaps between veterinary medicine and cultic dynamics. The conversation highlights how overwork, guilt, and moral injury can act as control mechanisms in \u201Chelping professions\u201D like veterinary care\u2014mirroring high-demand group tactics.\nDr. Jo discusses the emotional toll of her work, including the constant oscillation between joy (new puppies) and grief (euthanasia), the high suicide rate among veterinarians, and the systemic lack of self-care built into the profession. Daniella connects these patterns to her broader analysis of institutional cultures that exploit compassion, while Scot reflects on similar burnout dynamics from his time as a pastor.\nThe trio also dives into capitalism\u2019s role in normalizing self-sacrifice, the ethics of euthanasia, empathy toward animals and humans, and the need for structural\u2014not just individual\u2014change to protect caregivers from exploitation. The episode ends with a reminder: veterinarians are humans too, carrying invisible emotional burdens.\n\nDaniella\u0027s Links:\nPreorder for Culting of America: The Culting of America PRE-SALE (SHIPS BY JANUARY 20, 2026) \u2013 Knitting Cult Lady\nGo Fund Me for Publishing Culting of America: https://tr.ee/FTOBLyQnYo\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/4muxbu6 / @knittingcultladychat\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nCults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://sites.libsyn.com/534892/site\n\nScot\u0027s Socials\nTikTok:  @thescotloyd\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/@thescotloyd\nHaley\u0027s Tiktok\n@nuancedmasculinities\n\n\uD83D\uDCA1 Key Takeaways\nVeterinary medicine shares cult-like traits such as overwork as virtue, guilt-based control, and moral self-sacrifice.\n\nEmotional compartmentalization is required\u2014vets may euthanize a long-time patient then pivot to a joyful new-pet visit minutes later.\n\nThe suicide rate among veterinarians is alarmingly high, often tied to compassion fatigue and systemic overextension.\n\nCapitalism reinforces burnout, framing constant labor and self-denial as moral goodness.\n\nMany vets struggle to find balance between client care and self-care, often skipping breaks or feeling guilty for resting.\n\nCOVID-19 worsened burnout by increasing pet ownership while reducing staff capacity.\n\nFinancial misconceptions persist: veterinary procedures are costly but still drastically cheaper than equivalent human care.\n\nEuthanasia ethics are complex\u2014vets must navigate between mercy, owner intent, and lack of viable alternatives.\n\nEmpathy erosion in cults and capitalism parallels how systems dehumanize caregivers and animals alike.\n\nReal solutions require institutional change, not just resilience training for individuals.\n\nSimple kindness from clients can profoundly impact veterinary workers\u2019 wellbeing.\n\nProfessional roles and uniforms can dehumanize caregivers\u2014remembering their humanity matters.\n\nHelping professions often attract perfectionists and empaths, making them more vulnerable to exploitation.\n\nBoth hosts link these patterns to broader social \u201Cmeta-cults\u201D\u2014capitalism, productivity culture, and religious ideology.\n\nChapters\n00:00 Introduction and Rapture Day\n01:09 Meet the Veterinarian: Jo\u0027s Journey\n03:09 Cults and Veterinary Medicine: Unlikely Parallels\n05:21 Expectations vs. Reality in Veterinary Medicine\n08:34 The Emotional Toll of Veterinary Practice\n11:13 Navigating Client Relationships and Misinformation\n15:14 Cults and Empathy: A Unique Perspective\n18:41 The Ethics of Pet Ownership and Care\n21:10 Coping Mechanisms in Veterinary Medicine\n25:00 Community Support and the Burden of Service\n28:09 The Burnout Epidemic in Veterinary Medicine\n30:18 Understanding the Costs of Veterinary Care\n35:28 Quality of Life Conversations with Pet Owners\n43:28 Self-Care and Avoiding Burnout in Veterinary Practice\n49:08 The Human Side of Veterinary Medicine\n\nProduced by Haley Phillips",

      "description": "In this episode of Cults and the Culting of America, hosts Daniela Mestyanek Young and Scot Loyd welcome musician and activist Candi Carpenter. The conversation dives into parallels between growing up in evangelical Christianity and high-control cult environments, with both Daniela and Candi sharing deeply personal stories.\n Candi discusses their upbringing as a pastor\u2019s kid in a gospel family band, the ways purity culture and religious control shaped their identity, and their long deconstruction journey. They reflect on how music, satire, and community have helped them reclaim their voice and selfhood after years of suppression.\n The discussion touches on the loneliness of cult childhoods, the psychological effects of being taught constant fear of sin and hell, and how neurodivergence (autism, OCD) made them especially vulnerable to indoctrination. Humor and satire emerge as powerful tools of resistance\u2014whether in music videos mocking political figures or in Daniela\u2019s plans for a \u201Ccult baby musical.\u201D\n The episode closes with reflections on healing, therapy, medication, and the importance of building authentic community beyond transactional, conversion-driven relationships.\n Candi\u0027s Links:\u00A0\n Spotify\u00A0\n Apple Music\n Youtube\u00A0\n Tiktok\n Instagram\n  Daniella\u0027s Links:\n   You can read all about my story in my book, Uncultured-- buy signed copies here.  https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\n  \u00A0\n   For more info on me:\n   Patreon:  https://bit.ly/YTPLanding\n   Cult book Clubs (Advanced AND Memoirs) Annual Membership:  https://bit.ly/YTPLanding\n   Get an autographed copy of my book, Uncultured:  https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\n   Get my book, Uncultured, from Bookshop.org:  https://bit.ly/4g1Ufw8\n   Daniella\u2019s Tiktok: Knitting Cult Lady\n   Instagram:  \u00A0https://bit.ly/4ePAOFK  / daniellamyoung_\u00A0\n   Unamerican video book (on Patreon):  https://bit.ly/YTVideoBook\n   Secret Practice video book (on Patreon):  https://bit.ly/3ZswGY8\n   Other Podcasts\n   Daniella\u0027s other podcast:  Hey White Women\n   Scot\u0027s Socials\n  TikTok:\u00A0  @thescotloyd\n Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/@thescotloyd\n Haley\u0027s Tiktok\n @nuancedmasculinities\n Key Takeaways   Parallel Journeys: Both Daniela and Candi grew up under strict religious control, with performance and purity culture shaping much of their childhood.\n   Music as Survival: Candi uses songwriting to process trauma, reclaim identity, and connect with others who share similar experiences.\n   Deconstruction \u0026 Identity: Their exit from evangelicalism was gradual, involving moments of perspective shift (like viewing church rituals through outsiders\u2019 eyes) and self-discovery (embracing their non-binary identity).\n   Neurodivergence \u0026 Cults: Autism and OCD traits made Candi especially susceptible to religious rules, scrupulosity, and fear-based control.\n   Purity Culture \u0026 Harm: Conversations highlighted how purity teachings overlap with exploitation, creating damaging relationships with sex, self, and others.\n   Satire as Activism: Through bold political satire (like their \u201CAmerican God\u201D video), Candi critiques extremism and authoritarianism with humor.\n   Community After Cults: Online spaces like Candi\u2019s Discord \u201CCandyland\u201D provide connection and solidarity for those who once felt isolated.\n   Healing Tools: Therapy, finding the right medication, and embracing joy (from late-night milkshakes to creative play) are key in recovery.\n   Unmasking \u0026 Authenticity: A central theme is moving from masking and people-pleasing (ingrained by cult culture) toward living authentically without fear of rejection.\n   Shared Mission: Both Daniela and Candi see their art\u2014books, music, satire, musicals\u2014as ways to expose control systems, build resilience, and help others heal.\n   Chapters\n 00:00 Introduction to Candi Carpenter and Cult Themes\n 02:51 Exploring the Impact of Cults on Identity\n 05:31 Deconstructing Religious Upbringing and Its Effects\n 08:38 The Role of Music in Healing and Community\n 11:19 Navigating Personal Trauma and Artistic Expression\n 14:07 The Intersection of Humor and Activism\n 17:23 Political Satire and the Role of Artists\n 20:03 Embracing Individuality and Non-Binary Identity\n 22:54 The Future of Music and Activism\n 25:44 Conclusion and Reflections on Fear and Anger\n 30:42 The Journey of Healing and Self-Discovery\n 34:23 Navigating Relationships Beyond Cults\n 37:16 The Struggle with People-Pleasing\n 40:21 Embracing Authenticity and Self-Acceptance\n 44:45 The Role of Therapy and Medication in Healing\n 49:37 Creating Art as a Means of Expression\n Produced by Haley Phillips",

      "description": "In this episode of Cults and the Culting of America, hosts Scot Loyd and Daniella Mestyanek Young (\u201Cthe Knitting Cult Lady\u201D) interview Ruwan, a former member of OneTaste, a so-called \u201Corgasm cult\u201D centered around female sexuality and human connection. Ruwan recounts his two years in the organization, explaining how he was drawn in by its promises of intimacy and meaning, but soon became entangled in manipulation, labor exploitation, and coercive sales tactics.\n The discussion highlights parallels between OneTaste and other coercive groups, including the use of sex as recruitment, redefining language to control members\u2019 worldview, punishing dissent, and demanding lifelong commitment. Ruwan also reflects on the psychological toll of leaving, the social shunning he endured, and how indoctrination made it difficult to criticize the leader. The episode closes with reflections on cult dynamics, the dangers of committing one\u2019s life to a group or ideology, and Ruwan\u2019s upcoming memoir that ties his personal journey to OneTaste\u2019s recent criminal convictions.\n  Daniella\u0027s Links:\n   You can read all about my story in my book, Uncultured-- buy signed copies here.  https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\n  \u00A0\n   For more info on me:\n   Patreon:  https://bit.ly/YTPLanding\n   Cult book Clubs (Advanced AND Memoirs) Annual Membership:  https://bit.ly/YTPLanding\n   Get an autographed copy of my book, Uncultured:  https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\n   Get my book, Uncultured, from Bookshop.org:  https://bit.ly/4g1Ufw8\n   Daniella\u2019s Tiktok: Knitting Cult Lady\n   Instagram:  \u00A0https://bit.ly/4ePAOFK  / daniellamyoung_\u00A0\n   Unamerican video book (on Patreon):  https://bit.ly/YTVideoBook\n   Secret Practice video book (on Patreon):  https://bit.ly/3ZswGY8\n   Other Podcasts\n   Daniella\u0027s other podcast:  Hey White Women\n   Scot\u0027s Socials\n  TikTok:\u00A0  @thescotloyd\n Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/@thescotloyd\n Haley\u0027s Tiktok\n @nuancedmasculinities\n Key Takeaways   Sex as a recruitment tool: OneTaste initially used sexuality to attract members but retained them through promises of connection, meaning, and personal growth.\n   Labor exploitation: Members often worked for extremely low wages (e.g., $2/hour) under the belief that they were serving a higher cause.\n   Manipulation through language: Words like orgasm were redefined to mean progressively broader and more spiritual concepts, fostering a worldview unique to the group.\n   High performer recruitment: Contrary to stereotypes, cults often seek intelligent, articulate, and passionate individuals who can recruit others effectively.\n   Isolation tactics: Practices like banning \u201Ccollusion\u201D (sharing doubts) kept members from validating each other\u2019s concerns. Dissenters were shunned or vilified.\n   Commitment pressure: Members were pushed to \u201Ccommit their lives\u201D by giving up finances, autonomy, or public loyalty, often under threat of rejection.\n   Good cop/bad cop dynamics: Leaders or lieutenants alternated between affection and criticism to manipulate compliance.\n   False empowerment: Despite its branding as a female empowerment movement, OneTaste remained patriarchal and exploitative, especially of young women.\n   Leader protection: The founder avoided blame by delegating harsh decisions, maintaining a \u201Chalo effect\u201D that made criticism difficult.\n   Leaving costs: Exiting meant social exile, loss of community, and pressure to humiliate oneself in order to be accepted back.\n   Parallels to other systems: Comparisons were drawn to military indoctrination, religious cults, NXIVM, and Scientology, showing shared patterns of control.\n   Human vulnerability: Cults thrive by appealing to universal desires\u2014belonging, meaning, and devotion to a higher purpose\u2014while exploiting them for control.\n   Chapters\n 00:00 Isolation and Emotional Turmoil in Cults\n 33:10 The Legal Consequences of Cult Activities\n 36:09 The Dynamics of Power and Gender in Cults\n 39:01 Reflections on Cult Experiences and Future Directions\n Produced By Haley Phillips",

      "description": "In this episode of Cults and the Culting of America, hosts Daniella Mestyanek Young and Scot Loyd welcome Sydney, a member of the Cult Book Club, to share her personal story of growing up in the shadow of a multigenerational cult. Sydney recounts her family\u2019s involvement with the commune Christ Circle in the 1970s\u201380s, her experience being homeschooled in a high-control, secrecy-driven environment, and the lingering effects of trauma passed down through generations. She reflects on estranging from her mother, the challenges of being the \u201Ccycle breaker\u201D in her family, and how medical neglect, secrecy, and MAGA ideology compounded dysfunction. Sydney shares her diagnosis with POTS, her healing journey, and how reading Daniella\u2019s book gave her the language to process her past. The conversation highlights themes of secrecy, performance versus authenticity, generational trauma, and the courage it takes to leave and heal. The episode closes with Sydney reading a moving reflection addressed to \u201Ccycle breakers,\u201D emphasizing the exhausting but vital work of stopping harmful patterns and choosing a different path for future generations.

Generational trauma: Even those who didn\u2019t grow up directly in the cult carry the impact of their family\u2019s involvement. Cycle breaking: Refusing to pass trauma down to children requires conscious effort, vulnerability, and immense energy. Medical neglect in cults: Distrust of healthcare often leads to undiagnosed or untreated conditions, deepening harm. Authenticity vs. performance: Survivors reclaim agency by refusing to be \u201Cshiny showpieces\u201D and instead choosing authentic lives. Empowerment through language: Finding words to describe trauma and control systems is a crucial step in healing. Healing through community: Safe environments, supportive partners, and shared survivor stories provide tools for recovery.

      "description": "This episode of Cults and the Culting of America features guest Jess M. (aka White Mess Express), a former nurse, alongside hosts Daniella Mestyanek Young and Scot Loyd. The conversation explores how the U.S. healthcare system\u2014particularly nursing\u2014resembles a cult in its culture, practices, and systemic issues.\nJess describes the hierarchical \u0022rite of passage\u0022 culture in nursing (e.g., new nurses being called \u201Cbaby nurses\u201D and forced through hazing-like experiences). They highlight systemic contradictions: nurses are told to always be learning but punished for questioning authority, encouraged to self-sacrifice at the expense of their own health, and held individually responsible for systemic failures.\nThe discussion broadens to the U.S. healthcare system as a whole\u2014its prioritization of profit over care, its inequities toward marginalized groups, and the emotional toll on providers and patients alike. Daniella and Scot connect these patterns to cult dynamics: degradation rituals, infantilization, blind obedience, toxic positivity, and punishment for dissent.\nJess shares personal experiences of disillusionment: discovering nursing\u2019s promises of stability and meaning were hollow, dealing with disability from the physical demands of the work, and grieving the loss of identity and purpose after leaving the profession. They emphasize the need for gratitude toward frontline staff, patient self-advocacy, and systemic change.\nThe episode closes with encouragement: while healthcare workers may feel trapped in a \u201Ccult of medicine,\u201D deconstructing the experience allows them to reclaim their skills and narratives. Jess also shares where listeners can follow their ongoing work on TikTok and other platforms.\nDaniella\u0027s Links:\nGo Fund Me for Publishing Culting of America: https://tr.ee/FTOBLyQnYo\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/4muxbu6 / @knittingcultladychat\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\nIG: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nCults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://sites.libsyn.com/534892/site\nWhite Women Get Ready: https://www.mistresssyndrome.com/book\n\nScot\u0027s Socials\nTikTok:  @thescotloyd\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/@thescotloyd\n\nHaley\u0027s Tiktok\n@nuancedmasculinities\n\nJess\u0027s Links: \nlinktree\n\nKey Takeaways\n\u25CF Nursing culture as a \u201Ccult\u201D:\n\u25CB Hierarchical structure with forced rites of passage (\u201Cbaby nurse\u201D system).\n\u25CB Bullying, hazing, and degradation rituals normalize suffering.\n\u25CB Emotional suppression is enforced\u2014nurses must \u201Cput on a nurse face.\u201D\n\u25CB Constant demand for self-sacrifice, often leading to burnout or worse.\n\u25CF Systemic contradictions:\n\u25CB Nurses are told to always be learning, but punished for questioning authority.\n\u25CB Healthcare talks about being \u201Csystemic\u201D but punishes individuals for systemic failures.\n\u25CB Promises of good pay, benefits, and flexibility often clash with reality (mandatory overtime, long shifts, poor work-life balance).\n\u25CF Healthcare as a profit-driven business:\n\u25CB U.S. healthcare prioritizes money over patient wellbeing.\n\u25CB Marginalized groups bear the brunt\u2014Black and brown people, unhoused individuals, women, the poor.\n\u25CB Providers often have no say in pricing or systemic policies.\n\u25CF Impact on patients and providers:\n\u25CB Patients face bankruptcy, neglect, or dismissal of their concerns.\n\u25CB Providers internalize a culture of silence, mistrust, and emotional suppression.\n\u25CB Many healthcare workers avoid seeking care themselves due to stigma or normalization of suffering.\n\u25CF Breaking out of the \u201Ccult\u201D:\n\u25CB Leaving healthcare can feel like grief or loss of identity.\n\u25CB Gratitude from patients can be more meaningful than institutional rewards (\u201Cpizza party\u201D culture).\n\u25CB Patients can advocate for themselves by remembering they are the experts on their own bodies.\n\u25CB Deconstructing cult-like systems allows survivors to reclaim and repurpose their skills and experiences.\n\nChapters\n00:00 Introduction to the Healthcare System\u0027s Cult-like Nature\n 02:53 The Hierarchical Structure in Nursing\n 05:43 Systemic Issues in Healthcare\n 08:35 The Role of Nurses vs. Doctors\n 11:23 Healthcare as a Business\n 14:29 The Impact of Privilege on Healthcare Access\n 17:29 Experiences with Vulnerable Patients\n 20:20 Expectations vs. Reality in Nursing\n 23:28 Emotional Toll of Nursing and Military Service\n 28:08 Navigating Emotions in Healthcare\n 31:02 The Patient Experience: A Nurse\u0027s Perspective\n 33:45 The Reality of Nursing: Expectations vs. Reality\n 37:47 The Cult of Healthcare: A Critical Examination\n 47:34 Self-Advocacy in Healthcare: Empowering Patients\n 50:33 The Grieving Process of Leaving Healthcare\nProduced by Haley Phillips",

      "description": "In this episode of Cults and the Culting of America, Scot Loyd joins Haley while Daniella is away on her book tour. The conversation centers on Scot\u2019s forthcoming memoir The God I Was Given: Looking for Faith After Losing My Religion, which blends personal memoir with philosophical and scholarly reflections on growing up in the United Pentecostal Church (UPC). Scot discusses the creative and emotional risks of releasing such a personal work, particularly the fear of being misunderstood or dismissed by current UPC members.\n\nGet Scot\u0027s book here! https://a.co/d/4GD8Joe\n\nHe shares vivid stories from his childhood in rural Arkansas, shaped by his religious grandmother\u2019s influence and the paradox of being raised under a strong female matriarch within a patriarchal religious system. The discussion explores masculinity, gender socialization, identity loss after leaving a high-control religion, and the role of storytelling in fostering empathy and understanding. Scot emphasizes that leaving the church cost him his core identity as a \u201CPentecostal preacher,\u201D but also gave him the opportunity to discover and cultivate other talents.\nThroughout, Scot and Haley highlight the need for nuance in conversations about faith, deconstruction, and human identity, advocating for a broader cultural shift toward allowing multiple ways of being without harm.\nDaniella\u0027s Links:\nGo Fund Me for Publishing Culting of America: https://tr.ee/FTOBLyQnYo\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/4muxbu6 / @knittingcultladychat\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nCults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://sites.libsyn.com/534892/site\nWhite Women Get Ready: https://www.mistresssyndrome.com/book\n\nOther Podcasts\nDaniella\u0027s other podcast: Hey White Women\nScot\u0027s Socials\nTikTok:  @thescotloyd\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/@thescotloyd\nHaley\u0027s Tiktok\n@nuancedmasculinities\n\nKey Takeaways\nBook Launch \u0026 Themes: Scot\u2019s book is a hybrid of memoir and analysis, examining his upbringing in the UPC and the philosophical implications of faith, identity, and place.\n\n\nFear of Misunderstanding: He worries readers\u2014especially current UPC members\u2014may not engage with the book\u2019s nuance, expecting it to be more condemning than it is.\n\n\nNuance Over Binary Thinking: Scot stresses that his church experience included both positive and harmful elements, and that faith should be open to scrutiny.\n\n\nMatriarch in a Patriarchal World: His grandmother wielded significant influence despite strict religious rules limiting women\u2019s roles, creating a confusing model of gender for Scot.\n\n\nMasculinity \u0026 Socialization: Haley and Scot discuss how men raised as \u201Cchoosers\u201D in patriarchal contexts may struggle with rejection, and how rigid gender roles harm everyone.\n\n\nLoss of Identity After Leaving: Exiting the UPC meant losing his defining role as a preacher, forcing a reevaluation of self and purpose.\n\n\nStorytelling as Healing: Scot sees storytelling as a vital tool for empathy and connection, more impactful than sermons or lectures.\n\n\nValues as Identity Anchor: Both discuss grounding identity in values rather than rigid self-concepts to avoid spirals and allow personal growth.\n\n\nChapters\n00:00 Introduction and Book Announcement\n 03:27 Fears and Expectations of a New Author\n 11:25 The Influence of Geography on Faith\n 20:04 Navigating Patriarchy and Matriarchy\n 29:25 Masculinity and the Burden of Choice\n 31:30 The Burden of Expectations\n 37:48 Navigating Identity and Masculinity\n 43:09 The Power of Storytelling in Healing\n 46:34 The Cost of Leaving a Religious Identity\n 54:35 Values Over Identity: A New Perspective\nProduced by Haley Phillips",

      "title": "Sunday Brunch: The Musical",
      "description": "In this episode, Scott Loyd interviews the creators and a performer from Sunday Brunch: The Musical, a new theatrical work that humorously explores cult dynamics through a family brunch gone spectacularly wrong. While cult expert and regular host Daniella Mestyanek Young is absent due to technical difficulties, she sends in praise for the team\u2019s viral \u201Ccult song,\u201D noting how deeply it resonated with survivor experiences.\nGuests Ernie Bird (composer/co-writer), Rachel Abramon (lyricist/co-writer), and Gabrielle Filloux (performer) delve into the creative origins, songwriting process, and comedic construction of the show. Originally written during a jobless winter break as a fun project between friends, Sunday Brunch grew into a layered musical exploring dysfunction, privilege, and the absurdities of cult logic\u2014all grounded in levity and genuine empathy.\nTheir viral charm song features an escalating back-and-forth between two characters trying to one-up each other\u2019s trauma\u2014with one repeatedly revealing that every family member is, in fact, in a cult. The group discusses the delicate balance of comedy and respect, how cult themes naturally wove into the narrative, and how they may expand the story into a larger universe featuring the three-headed bear deity and warring cults.\nThe episode also explores broader insights into cult dynamics, including the \u201Cmeta-cults\u201D of capitalism, white supremacy, and toxic workplace culture. Each guest shares personal brushes with high-control environments, even if not officially in cults, reinforcing the pervasiveness of coercive systems in everyday life.\nKeep up with the Musical: \n\u25CF Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sundaybrunchthemusical/\n\n\u25CF TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@erniebored\n\n\u25CF Ernie\u2019s site: https://imerniebird.com\n\nDaniella\u0027s Links:\nYou can read all about my story in my book, Uncultured-- buy signed copies here. https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\n \nFor more info on me:\nGo Fund Me for Publishing Culting of America: https://tr.ee/FTOBLyQnYo\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/4muxbu6 / @knittingcultladychat\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nCults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://sites.libsyn.com/534892/site\nWhite Women Get Ready: https://www.mistresssyndrome.com/book\n\nScot\u0027s TikTok\n@thescotloyd\nHaley\u0027s Tiktok\n@nuancedmasculinities\n\nKey Takeaways\n\u25CF \uD83E\uDD5E Sunday Brunch is about more than brunch: What began as a casual writing experiment became a thoughtful and absurdist musical that explores cult dynamics through comedy.\n\n\u25CF \uD83C\uDFB6 The \u201CCult Song\u201D hit a nerve: The viral charm song resonated deeply with survivors\u2014especially its honest portrayal of how absurd (and painful) cult logic can be when juxtaposed with \u201Cnormal\u201D life.\n\n\u25CF \uD83C\uDFAD Comedy with respect: The team imposed structural rules (e.g., every chorus must mention the cult) that challenged them to find humor without mocking trauma\u2014highlighting the difficulty and importance of \u201Cpunching up.\u201D\n\n\u25CF \uD83E\uDDE0 Art can offer catharsis: Humor becomes a vehicle for emotional release, empathy, and representation of marginalized experiences\u2014including those of cult survivors.\n\n\u25CF \uD83D\uDC3B There\u2019s lore now?! The writers accidentally created rich backstory (e.g., cult wars, a three-headed bear god, a waitress married to a cult leader) and are considering a spin-off musical set fully inside the cult.\n\n\u25CF \uD83D\uDCAC Cult experiences exist on a spectrum: Even without direct cult involvement, all guests reflected on how systems\u2014like oppressive workplaces or nationalist ideologies\u2014can mimic cult behavior.\n\n\u25CF \u2764\uFE0F Creative partnerships matter: Ernie and Rachel\u2019s deep friendship and comedic trust allowed for bold, weird, and eventually impactful storytelling.\n\n\u25CF \uD83D\uDCE2 Support artists: Follow Sunday Brunch: The Musical on Instagram and TikTok [@sundaybrunchthemusical], and look out for their official demos coming soon to Spotify.\n\nChapters\n00:00 Introduction to Sunday Brunch Musical\n02:59 The Creative Process Behind Sunday Brunch\n05:54 Character Development and Song Composition\n08:56 Exploring Themes of Cults in the Musical\n12:05 Comedy in Musical Theater\n15:10 Personal Experiences with Cults\n17:57 The Role of Art and Comedy in Society\n21:09 Future Projects and Aspirations\n24:01 Conclusion and Call to Action\nProduced by Haley Phillips",

      "description": "This episode of Cults and the Culting of America features guest Kelvin, a political scientist and community organizer, in a deep dive on whether capitalism functions as a cult and how overlapping systems like patriarchy, white supremacy, and religion have historically reinforced each other. The hosts, Scot and Daniella, explore the evolution of these frameworks\u2014from European colonialism and the doctrine of discovery to modern American politics\u2014and discuss how these systemic beliefs sustain cult-like behaviors in society. The conversation covers the historical hijacking of Christianity, education as a control mechanism, the cult of Americanism, and the psychological and political strategies that uphold oppressive systems.

      "description": "In this revealing and emotionally rich episode of Cults and the Culting of America, Cynthia Williams joins hosts Scot Loyd and Daniella Mestyanek Young to unpack her journey through\u2014and out of\u2014the United Pentecostal Church International (UPCI). Cynthia shares how, like many others, she once believed that her local church was different. The rules were strict, yes, but they felt spiritually justified\u2014until the cracks began to show.\nAs Cynthia puts it, the realization came slowly: \u201CI think it\u0027s probably just in the last two years\u2026 that I finally was like, wait a minute, I think I was in a cult.\u201D That moment of clarity is a turning point in the episode, as the conversation explores how UPCI and similar groups protect themselves through plausible deniability. \u201CNot my church,\u201D people say\u2014oblivious or unwilling to confront the broader systemic harm. Cynthia describes how Bible college exposed her to both a deeper version of indoctrination and\u2014paradoxically\u2014the seeds of her exit. Through theology classes and critical thinking challenges, she began questioning the very doctrines that once gave her purpose. The episode also dives into her experience witnessing the tragic death of a teenage girl at Bible school\u2014a loss that the church quickly co-opted into a martyrdom narrative, silencing Cynthia\u2019s voice and rewriting the truth. Alongside moments of grief and spiritual disillusionment, the hosts discuss cult tactics like toxic positivity, spiritual bypassing, gendered control, and the recurring pattern of falling into other high-control environments even after leaving religion. From the military to corporate America, Cynthia\u2019s story traces how these systems echo one another\u2014and how healing requires naming those echoes for what they are. With warmth, honesty, and shared survivor wisdom, this episode is a candid look at what it means to say, \u201CMaybe it was my church after all.\u201D\n \nFor more info on me:\nGo Fund Me for Publishing Culting of America: https://tr.ee/FTOBLyQnYo\nAutographed book: https://uncultureyourself.com/pages/uncultured-autographed\nFrom Bookshop.org: https://bookshop.org/a/104058/9781250280114\nDaniella\u2019s Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GroupBehaviorGal\nDaniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/4muxbu6 / @knittingcultladychat\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFRBZ2w3QsYs7Km69keHsg\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stories/daniellamyoung_/\nHey White Women Podcast: https://tr.ee/2gWVBFaYnp\\\nCults and the Culting of America Podcast: https://sites.libsyn.com/534892/site\n\nKey Take-Aways\n\u25CFRules varied by pastor but enforced absolute obedience, reinforcing the illusion of autonomy while maintaining tight control.\n\u25CFWomen were subjected to extreme modesty standards, with the specifics often shifting\u2014creating confusion and deep internalization of shame and obedience.\n\u25CFPlausible deniability (\u0022not my church\u0022) was used to disguise systemic problems across UPCI.\n\u25CFWomen in UPCI were expected to be either angelic \u201Csaints\u201D or demonized \u201CJezebels\u201D\u2014no in-between.\n\u25CFWomen showing independence or intellect were often ostracized or tightly policed.\n\u25CFCynthia\u2019s racial identity and outsider status gave her marginal freedom to step outside strict gender molds\u2014but also made her invisible in some ways.\n\u25CFBible school inadvertently helped Cynthia develop critical thinking, ultimately aiding her exit.\n\u25CFLeaving the group meant not just losing community, but also certainty, purpose, and a framework for meaning.\n\u25CFLike many ex-cult members, Cynthia found herself repeatedly drawn to similarly high-control environments even after leaving UPCI.\n\u25CFThe murder of a student Cynthia mentored was mishandled by the church, which spun the event into a martyrdom narrative\u2014silencing Cynthia and distorting the truth.\n\u25CFCynthia shares how old coping strategies like breaking into church songs still emerge under stress\u2014signs of deep conditioning and dissociation.\n\u25CFDaniella highlights the concept of being an \u201Cinvisible immigrant\u201D\u2014growing up in an insular religious world without cultural references or grounding in the outside world.\n\u25CFThey celebrate the comfort and solidarity found in the \u201Cex-cult sisterhood\u201D\u2014a chosen family of people who get it.\n\nChapters\n00:00 Introduction to Cult Experiences\n 03:10 Personal Journeys in the United Pentecostal Church\n 06:01 Expectations and Restrictions for Women\n 08:46 Identifying Cult-like Behaviors\n 11:54 The Role of Education in Cult Awareness\n 15:05 Navigating Gender Dynamics in Cults\n 17:45 The Impact of Nostalgia and Shared Experiences\n 20:59 Emotional Healing and Reflection\n 23:57 Coping with Life After Leaving a Cult\n 30:20 Revisiting Trauma and Dissociation\n 31:55 Toxic Positivity in High-Control Groups\n 34:14 Tragedy and Manipulation: The Church\u0027s Narrative\n 39:40 The Impact of Violence on Faith Communities\n 43:23 Identity Crisis After Leaving the Cult\n 50:07 Life After the Cult: Finding New Paths\nProduced by Haley Phillips",

      "description": "This week on Cults and the Culting of America, we\u2019re turning the mic toward someone you all know well\u2014our beloved cohost, Scot Loyd. With no guest this episode, Daniella takes the opportunity to spotlight Scot\u2019s powerful personal journey and upcoming book, The God That I Was Given.\n In an open and layered conversation, Scot reflects on his years inside the United Pentecostal Church, his rise to leadership, and what it meant to deconstruct the faith and ideologies that shaped him. He and Daniella discuss the gendered nature of cult experiences, the silence often expected of men, and how writing becomes both a weapon and a lifeline for survivors.\n They also dig deep into the racist roots of Pentecostalism, the enduring myth of white Christian victimhood, and how cult dynamics echo through American politics today.\n Whether you\u2019ve been here since episode one or are just tuning in, this intimate episode offers a closer look at Scot\u2019s story and the broader systems of power so many of us are still trying to untangle.\n  Daniella\u0027s Links:\n   You can read all about my story in my book, Uncultured-- buy signed copies here.  https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\n  \u00A0\n   For more info on me:\n   Patreon:  https://bit.ly/YTPLanding\n   Cult book Clubs (Advanced AND Memoirs) Annual Membership:  https://bit.ly/YTPLanding\n   Get an autographed copy of my book, Uncultured:  https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\n   Get my book, Uncultured, from Bookshop.org:  https://bit.ly/4g1Ufw8\n   Daniella\u2019s Tiktok:  https://bit.ly/4bwvNC0\n   Instagram:  \u00A0https://bit.ly/4ePAOFK  / daniellamyoung_\u00A0\n   Unamerican video book (on Patreon):  https://bit.ly/YTVideoBook\n   Secret Practice video book (on Patreon):  https://bit.ly/3ZswGY8\n   Other Podcasts\n   Daniella\u0027s other podcast:  Hey White Women\n   Scot\u0027s TikTok\n   @thescotloyd\n Haley\u0027s Tiktok\n @nuancedmasculinities\n Takeways\n   Even Survivors Can Be Complicit\n Scot reflects on how he not only endured harm within the United Pentecostal Church but also perpetuated it as a preacher and leader. His journey involves confronting both victimhood and complicity\u2014a nuanced look at accountability in high-control systems.\n   Patriarchy Shields Men from Cult Harm\u2014and From Speaking Out\n The conversation explores why fewer men write cult survivor memoirs: patriarchal systems often cushion men from the worst abuses and discourage emotional vulnerability, leaving their stories underrepresented.\n   Faith Deconstruction Is Not Bitterness\u2014It\u2019s Clarity\n Scot addresses the accusation that leaving high-control religion makes you \u201Cbitter.\u201D Drawing on biblical stories (like Naomi in Ruth), he reframes bitterness as a justified and even holy reaction to harm\u2014and a fuel for transformation.\n   Cults Mirror American Systems of Power\n The episode draws strong parallels between cult dynamics and systemic issues in the U.S., including white supremacy, evangelical nationalism, and the cult of personality around political figures like Donald Trump.\n   Telling the Truth Is a Radical Act\n Both hosts emphasize the importance of sharing honest, unvarnished stories to give future generations language and context for their own experiences\u2014and to challenge whitewashed versions of history.\n   The Tools Used to Indoctrinate Can Be Used to Liberate\n Scot talks about reclaiming the skills he developed in church\u2014preaching, writing, public speaking\u2014to critique the very systems that shaped him. Daniella echoes this with her own story, highlighting the healing power of storytelling.\n   Cult Experiences Are Strikingly Universal\n While each cult has its own doctrine or dogma, the episode highlights the common traits\u2014performance culture, black-and-white thinking, suppression of autonomy\u2014that unite cult survivors across backgrounds.\n   Chapters\n 00:00 Introduction and Book Projects\n 03:26 Exploring Gender Perspectives in Cult Experiences\n 06:37 The Unraveling of Beliefs and Personal Reflection\n 09:27 The Role of Education in Leaving Cults\n 12:20 Writing as a Tool for Healing and Reflection\n 15:36 Navigating the Complexity of Cult Narratives\n 18:24 Confronting the Charge of Bitterness\n 21:17 The Power of Personal Stories in Cult Recovery\n 24:25 The Importance of Documenting Experiences for Future Generations\n 31:56 The Burden of Representation in Cults\n 35:18 Historical Narratives and Cultural Spin\n 39:56 The Roots of Pentecostalism and Racism\n 44:39 The Legacy of Racism in American Christianity\n 49:40 Cult of Personality vs. Cult of Ideas\n 56:11 The Current Political Climate and Its Cult-like Dynamics\n Produced by Haley Phillips",

Young adults are particularly vulnerable to corporate recruitment tactics. The fun environment at Starbucks was a major draw for Kasi. The concept of \u0027family\u0027 in corporations can be misleading. Leadership programs often serve the organization\u0027s needs more than the individual\u0027s. Emotional manipulation is prevalent in corporate events and culture. Mental health struggles can arise from high-demand work environments. Self-sabotage can occur when trying to maintain a positive image in a toxic environment. The deification of leaders can create a cult-like atmosphere in companies. Mourning the loss of belief in a caring organization is a common experience.

      "description": "In this episode, Scott and Daniella engage with Brianna, who shares her profound journey through the world of yoga and her experiences at Yogaville, a yoga community that turned out to be more complex than it seemed. Brianna discusses her initial attraction to the community, the positive aspects she encountered, and the darker realities that unfolded over time, including manipulation, abuse, and the psychological toll of being involved in a cult-like environment. The conversation emphasizes the importance of trust, intuition, and the need for open discussions about both the good and bad experiences within such organizations.\n Briana\u0027s Podcast\n Surviving Satchidananda\n Haley\u0027s Tiktok\n @nuancedmasculinities\n  Daniella\u0027s Links:\n   You can read all about my story in my book, Uncultured-- buy signed copies here.  https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\n  \u00A0\n   For more info on me:\n   Patreon:  https://bit.ly/YTPLanding\n   Cult book Clubs (Advanced AND Memoirs) Annual Membership:  https://bit.ly/YTPLanding\n   Get an autographed copy of my book, Uncultured:  https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured\n   Get my book, Uncultured, from Bookshop.org:  https://bit.ly/4g1Ufw8\n   Daniella\u2019s Tiktok:  https://bit.ly/4bwvNC0\n   Instagram:  \u00A0https://bit.ly/4ePAOFK  / daniellamyoung_\u00A0\n   Unamerican video book (on Patreon):  https://bit.ly/YTVideoBook\n   Secret Practice video book (on Patreon):  https://bit.ly/3ZswGY8\n   Other Podcasts\n   Daniella\u0027s other podcast:  Hey White Women\n   Scot\u0027s TikTok\n   @thescotloyd\n Takeaways\n  Brianna\u0027s journey began with a search for community and healing through yoga. Yogaville initially provided a sense of belonging and support for Brianna. Cults often exploit individuals during vulnerable times in their lives. Positive experiences in cults can make it difficult to recognize abuse. Secrecy and misinformation are common tactics used by cults to maintain control. Brianna experienced both joy and trauma during her time at Yogaville. Trusting one\u0027s intuition is crucial when something feels off. Cults can provide a sense of purpose but often at a significant cost. The psychological impact of cult involvement can be profound and long-lasting. Advocacy and sharing stories are essential for healing and awareness.

Jack shares his personal journey from a troubled upbringing to his work in men\u0027s circles, emphasizing the need for vulnerability, community, and a redefinition of masculinity that moves away from harmful stereotypes.

There is a significant difference between sex (male) and gender (man). Cultural influences shape our understanding of gender from a very young age. Parenting plays a crucial role in shaping children\u0027s perceptions of gender. Communication styles differ between boys and girls, often influenced by societal norms. The cult of masculinity imposes harmful expectations on men. Anger among men often stems from unmet societal promises and expectations. The narrative of male superiority is a damaging myth. Men often sacrifice their emotional health for societal expectations. Building healthy male communities is essential for emotional well-being.

The discussion touches on themes of identity, race, and the struggles of belonging within high-control groups. They explore the dynamics of critical thinking versus apologetics in Christian education, the impact of the model minority myth, and the role of empathy in Christianity. Scott reflects on his experiences teaching at a Christian university and the challenges he faced while trying to foster a more inclusive environment.

The conversation highlights the struggles of identity and belonging in high-control groups. Critical thinking is often stifled in Christian education, replaced by apologetics. The model minority myth complicates the experiences of Asian Americans in evangelical spaces. Empathy is lacking in contemporary Christianity, as evidenced by recent teachings. Scott\u0027s journey out of evangelicalism was gradual, marked by many small realizations. Interpersonal relationships can be a significant barrier to leaving high-control groups. Scott\u0027s current work focuses on helping others navigate their experiences in Christian schools. The conversation draws parallels between cult dynamics and the tech industry.

      "description": "In this episode, Scott Loyd and Daniella Mesteneck Young engage in a deep conversation with Taylor Marie, a mental health therapist and cult survivor. Taylor shares her experiences with an online cult, discussing the similarities between online and in-person cults, the recruitment tactics used, and the psychological manipulation involved. The conversation explores the dynamics of charismatic leadership, the exploitation of belonging and purpose, and the red flags that led to Taylor\u0027s eventual departure from the cult. The discussion also touches on the importance of healthy leadership and the potential for spiritual practices to exist without devolving into cult-like behavior. In this conversation, Taylor Marie shares her harrowing experience of being involved in a cult-like astrology group, detailing the emotional turmoil and moral conflicts she faced. She discusses the manipulative tactics of the cult leader, the fear of leaving, and the subsequent backlash she received after her departure. The conversation highlights the importance of questioning authority and the role of social media in exposing harmful groups. Taylor\u0027s journey of self-discovery and the impact on her family dynamics are also explored, culminating in a powerful narrative of resilience and personal growth.\n Daniella\u0027s Links:\n  You can read all about my story in my book, Uncultured-- buy signed copies here. https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured  For more info on me:  Patreon: https://bit.ly/YTPLanding  Cult book Clubs (Advanced AND Memoirs) Annual Membership: https://bit.ly/YTPLanding  Get an autographed copy of my book, Uncultured: https://bit.ly/SignedUncultured  Get my book, Uncultured, from Bookshop.org: https://bit.ly/4g1Ufw8  Daniella\u2019s Tiktok: https://bit.ly/3V6GK6k / KnittingCultLady  Instagram:\u00A0 https://bit.ly/4ePAOFK / daniellamyoung_\u00A0  Unamerican video book (on Patreon): https://bit.ly/YTVideoBook  Secret Practice video book (on Patreon): https://bit.ly/3ZswGY8  Other Podcasts\n Daniella\u0027s other podcast: Hey White Women\n Takeaways\n  Taylor Marie is a mental health therapist specializing in narcissistic abuse and cult recovery. Online cults operate similarly to in-person cults, with differences mainly in communication. Recruitment often occurs through social media platforms like TikTok, using charisma and confidence. The sense of belonging is a powerful tool used by cults to maintain control over members. Charismatic leaders often exploit followers\u0027 desires for purpose and belonging. Red flags include isolation from outside information and constant negative comparisons to others in the field. Healthy leadership promotes free thinking and allows for questioning and disagreement. Cults often take credit for the successes of their members, creating a cycle of dependency. Leaving a cult can feel like a crisis, as one\u0027s worldview is challenged and dismantled. It is possible to lead in spiritual practices without coercion or manipulation. The breaking point often comes when personal values clash with group beliefs. Questioning authority can lead to significant personal revelations. Leaving a cult can involve emotional and legal repercussions. Social media can amplify voices and expose harmful practices. The aftermath of leaving a cult can affect family relationships. Cult leaders often manipulate their followers through fear and guilt. It\u0027s important to recognize the signs of cult-like behavior in groups. Personal growth often follows the questioning of long-held beliefs. The experience of leaving a cult can be isolating and traumatic. Support from family and friends is crucial during the exit process.

Topics like cognitive dissonance, patriotism, social control, and the manipulation tactics used by cults are also discussed, providing a comprehensive understanding of the psychological and social mechanisms at play within these environments.\n   Daniella Mestyanek Young\u0027s book:\n  \u00B7\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 From Bookshop.org\n    Uncultured  Autograph:\u00A0    Connect with Daniella on social media\n     TikTok,  Patreon,  Instagram\u00A0   Youtube    Connect with Scot Loyd\u0027s social media\u00A0 (TikTok)   Daniella\u0027s other podcast:  Hey White Women  **Scot Loyd:** Welcome to the *Cults and the Culting of America* podcast. I\u0027m Scott Loyd along with my friend Daniella Mestyanek Young, and she\u0027s written a book called *Uncultured,* which you should pick up. Both of us are cult survivors, and we\u0027re working through a list of characteristics that Daniella developed to help all of you, along with us, process and understand our cult experiences, as well as identify cults and high-control groups. So with that introduction, Daniella, which characteristic are we talking about today?\n **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Thanks so much for the introduction, Scott. Today, we are going to be talking about self-sacrifice. Specifically, in cults, there\u0027s the constant and continual self-sacrifice of the members. If you\u0027re just joining us, episode one has the whole list of my 10 characteristics that make up a cult, and we\u0027re going through each of those in detail.\n Self-sacrifice is number four on the list, but it connects very directly to number eight on the list, which is exploitation of labor.\n **Scot Loyd:** And you\u0027ve mentioned before that this is ultimately what cults are all about\u2014free labor, right?\n **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Exactly. When I heard cult scholar Dr. Janja Lalich say, \u0022Cults are about labor,\u0022 it broke my brain and gave me a whole different understanding of what I had experienced and why we were doing the things we did. Labor is your one inexhaustible resource. The cult leader is out for power, but the cult itself is about getting your labor. They tell you it\u2019s in pursuit of a transcendent mission, which we covered in episode three.\n In the Children of God cult, our mission was saving the world for Jesus before the end times. In the US Army, it was protecting American interests overseas. These missions are so grand and unquestionably good that they allow the cult and its leaders to constantly pull sacrifice from their members.\n **Scot Loyd:** You sent me something to read today, and you mentioned a term\u2014quoting Irving Goffman\u2014called a \u0022total institution.\u0022 I think when we\u0027re talking about cults, they certainly qualify as tot",

      "description": "### Summary of Cults and the Culting of America Podcast - Episode on Transcendent Mission\n In this episode of \u0022Cults and the Culting of America,\u0022 hosts Scot Loyd and Daniella Mestyanek Young delve into the concept of the transcendent mission within cults and high-control groups. They discuss how cult leaders use vague, life-and-death missions to manipulate and retain followers. These missions often promise fulfillment in an unprovable future, making followers feel unique and superior, thus willing to self-sacrifice and endure hardships.\n Daniella differentiates the transcendent mission from the sacred assumption, explaining that while the sacred assumption is an unspoken belief (e.g., the leader being the smartest or chosen one), the mission is what recruits and keeps people dedicated. The mission is rarely practical and constantly evolving, ensuring followers never feel they\u0027ve fully achieved it.\n The hosts also touch on the importance of recognizing the signs of manipulative missions, such as their vagueness, constant change, and exclusivity. Daniella advises that it\u2019s okay for individuals to focus on their own well-being and happiness instead of falling prey to manipulative missions.\n \u00A0\n   Daniella Mestyanek Young\u0027s book:\u00A0\n  \u00B7\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 From Bookshop.org\n    Uncultured  Autograph:\u00A0    Connect with Daniella on social media\n     TikTok,  Patreon,  Instagram\u00A0   Youtube    Connect with Scot Loyd\u0027s social media\u00A0 (TikTok)   Daniella\u0027s other podcast:  Hey White Women  \u00A0\n \u00A0\n **Hosts:** Daniella Mestyanek Young and Scot Loyd\n **Topic:** The Transcendent Mission in Cults and High-Control Groups\n **Overview:**\n In this episode, Daniella and Scot discuss the concept of the \u0022transcendent mission\u0022 and how it is used by cult leaders and high-control groups to manipulate and control their followers. They delve into the differences between the transcendent mission and the sacred assumption, the tactics used to recruit and retain followers, and the personal experiences of both hosts in various high-control environments.\n **Key Points:**\n 1. **Introduction to the Transcendent Mission:**\n \u00A0 \u00A0- Cult leaders create a transcendent mission to recruit and retain followers by promising a higher purpose or goal that often cannot be proven or achieved in this lifetime.\n \u00A0 \u00A0- The mission is usually vague, large-scale, and tied to life and death, making it compelling and difficult to question.\n 2. **Difference Between Transcendent Mission and Sacred Assumption:**\n \u00A0 \u00A0- The sacred assumption is an underlying, often unspoken belief that followers must accept to remain in good standing.\n \u00A0 \u00A0- The transcendent mission is the outward goal or purpose that the group is supposedly working towards, often used as a recruitment tool.\n 3. **Manipulation Tactics:**\n \u00A0 \u00A0- Cult leaders use the transcendent mission to justify extreme actions and sacrifices from their followers.\n \u00A0 \u00A0- Examples include religious cults promising salvation or enlightenment, and organizations like the military or corporations using missions to motivate self-sacrifice and loyalty.\n 4. **Personal Experiences:**\n \u00A0 \u00A0- Daniella shares her experiences in the Children of God cult and the US Army, highlighting the similarities in how both groups used a transcendent mission to control members.\n \u00A0 \u00A0- Scot discusses his upbringing in the United Pentecostal Church and how the promise of witnessing the return of Jesus was used to motivate followers.\n 5. **Challenges of Deconstruction:**\n \u00A0 \u00A0- Leaving a high-control group often involves losing a sense of mission and purpose, which can be terrifying and disorienting.\n \u00A0 \u00A0- Both hosts emphasize the importance of finding a new, personal mission that prioritizes individual well-being and happiness.\n 6. **Misconceptions About Good and Bad Cults:**\n \u00A0 \u00A0- Daniella argues that there is no such thing as a \u0022good cult\u0022 because the core mechanism of coercive control and self-sacrifice is inherently harmful.\n \u00A0 \u00A0- They discuss",

      "description": "In this episode of the Cults and the Culting of America podcast, hosts Scot Loyd and Daniella Mestyanek Young dive into the concept of the \u0022sacred assumption,\u0022 a core belief that underpins a cult\u0027s worldview. Daniella explains how cult leaders create and manipulate these worldviews to control their followers, emphasizing that these assumptions don\u0027t have to be religious but can revolve around power, status, or other ideals. The discussion touches on the similarities and differences between cults and religions, the manipulation tactics used by cult leaders, and the challenges of deconstructing these beliefs after leaving a cult. Daniella also shares personal anecdotes about her experiences with the Children of God cult and the US Army, highlighting the parallels between different high-control groups. Scot and Daniella discuss the ongoing process of deconstruction, the importance of questioning sacred assumptions, and the impact of privilege and societal constructs on our beliefs. They emphasize the need for skepticism and self-defined values, contrasting this with the often rigid and manipulative frameworks of cults. The episode concludes with a call to action for listeners to engage with Daniella\u0027s work, including her book Uncultured and her Patreon project UnAmerican.

I\u0027m your host, Scot Loyd. Welcome to another episode of Cults and the Culting of America. I\u0027m Scot Loyd, along with my friend Daniella Mestyanek Young. Not only is she my friend, but she is a scholar of cults, extreme groups, and extremely bad leadership. Daniella, how are you doing today? **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** I am doing great. I am excited for us to talk about the worldview shift into the transcendent mission and the most common question anyone gets asked about cults, which is: what is the difference between a cult and a religion? **Scot Loyd:** Very nicely said. I\u0027m looking forward to this episode. And you\u0027re wearing an interesting shirt today. Tell us about that shirt, and if folks want to buy one for themselves or their friends and family, how can they do that? **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Yes, you can find any of the shirts you see me wearing through the links below. I sell them through my social media channels. This shirt says, \u0022The first rule of cults is you\u0027re never in a cult,\u0022 which is the epigraph of my book, *Uncultured*. It\u0027s about growing up in the Children of God and joining the US Army. It\u0027s also a play on *Fight Club*, which a lot of people don\u0027t realize is kind of the cult movie. It really gets to the idea that nobody thinks they\u0027re in a cult. Cults are manipulative cons that target people, lie, deflect, and pull you into their worldview. As soon as you realize you\u0027re in a cult, you\u0027re on your way out. But many people think cults are extreme and rare, when in fact, they\u0027re incredibly common. A lot of my life\u0027s work is pointing out these parallels and helping people understand the groups and systems we\u0027re in. **Scot Loyd:** And we\u0027re going down the list of characteristics of a cult that you have identified and authored. Today we arrive at the idea of worldview, or as you call it, the sacred assumption. What do you mean by sacred assumption, and why is it a leading characteristic of a cult? **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Oh my gosh, this one is so dramatic. I mean, literally, I was in bed and I sat up and just yelled out, \u0022Hold nothing sacred.\u0022 It was the answer to the question I\u0027d been asked for 15 years: Why would anyone join a cult? How can people fall for such extremism? Growing up in the Children of God, which was a pedophile cult, it was perfectly understandable how it happened, but difficult to explain to outsiders. First, let me bring this back to that common question: what is the difference between a cult and a religion? This ties into worldview. People ask this all the time, and I say they\u0027re not even the same type of thing. A religion is an idea, a noun. A cult is a group. You need a group, even if it\u0027s just two people. One of the most pernicious stereotypes is that cults are religious. Every day I see people saying, \u0022Nah, not a cult, because we\u0027re not religious.\u0022 Part of why NXIVM fooled so many people is because it wasn\u0027t religious. Large group awareness training, like est or anything ending in \u0022-ony,\u0022 aren\u0027t religious but can still be cults. A cult doesn\u0027t give you a religion; it gives you a worldview. The leader spends decades forming this worldview, and to be a member, you must adopt it. It\u0027s not presented that way, but it becomes clear once you\u0027re in it. The entire worldview is upheld by the sacred assumption. In the Children of God, it was that this random white dude who failed at everything was the prophet of God. As long as you believe that, you can justify anything. The sacred assumption ties closely to the \u0022ends justify the means\u0022 mentality and sometimes even precipitates an apocalyptic mindset. **Scot Loyd:** The sacred assumption doesn\u0027t necessarily have to be theological in nature. It could be anything related to life, like pursuing wealth, status, or power. That\u0027s what a lot of these groups offer \u2013 a world change, a fulfilling life, or a flourishing existence. **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Right. In NXIVM, the sacred assumption was that Keith Raniere was the smartest man on earth. In the US Army, the sacred assumption is that the US flag is worth dying for. You must believe that to be successful in the Army. So, it doesn\u0027t have to be religious. It\u0027s a worldview. I\u0027ve recently realized all cults and cult leaders promise \u0022space travel,\u0022 meaning ultimate enlightenment or achievement will be on another plane, another existence, another life, a different heavenly body \u2013 something that can\u0027t be proven. This keeps people from achieving enlightenment because if it were real, they\u0027d leave. It\u0027s a crucial part of the con and makes it hard to crack people\u0027s brainwashing. As long as you choose to believe the sacred assumption, you can justify anything. **Scot Loyd:** When you talk about this sacred assumption or worldview, it reminds me of Aristotle\u0027s idea that to be persuasive, you need parts of your message that are familiar and parts that are novel. If it\u0027s all novelty, people are likely to reject it. But if there\u0027s something familiar at the core, it resonates with people. Cult leaders leverage these familiar sacred assumptions that people are already familiar with to control their thoughts and behavior. **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Yes, and I think this is exactly what Taylor Swift means when she says, \u0022You know how to ball, I know Aristotle.\u0022 She\u0027s dropping lines because she knows how to pull emotional strings. Cult leaders know how to manipulate you by leveraging these familiar concepts. I don\u0027t agree with the stereotype that cult leaders start off good and then turn bad. Cult leaders don\u0027t trip and fall into coercive control. They\u0027ve been figuring this out for a long time. For example, Jim Jones was studying how to manipulate people with preacher voice from a young age. He never cared about civil rights; it was just his way to stand out. This is why religion is often used \u2013 it\u0027s a pre-existing worldview with a giant body of literature and concepts that a cult leader can tweak and spin to fit their agenda. They use these frameworks to radicalize people. Religions have thought-stopping clich\u00E9s built in, where at some point, logic ceases, and you go forward on faith. Nefarious leaders who have been honing their manipulative skills know how to use that. **Scot Loyd:** Right. And the thought-stopping clich\u00E9 is, \u0022God told me to do this.\u0022 When someone plays that card, how do you come back from it? You don\u0027t. There\u0027s nothing you can say if they claim to have heard from God. Cult leaders play on these collective questions we all have about origin, destiny, meaning, morality, and purpose. They offer answers with certainty, enthusiasm, and passion. The human dynamic often makes us fall in line and not question these sacred assumptions. **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Absolutely. And deconstruction tip, Scot, can you repeat that list? We need to make sure this is in the show notes. **Scot Loyd:** Sure. The list is origin (where did I come from?), destiny (where am I going?), meaning (what does it all mean?), morality (how do we treat one another?), and purpose (what should I do with my life?). **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** These are the huge questions you have to define for yourself when you leave a cult. You\u0027re rejecting a worldview. My three-part model of deconstruction is: first, wake up and physically and mentally leave the cult; second, spend about a decade understanding why you were in a cult and its impact on your personality and identity; and third, move forward with no models. It\u0027s overwhelming because you\u0027ve lost your framework and have to answer these giant questions. This is why we\u0027re at risk of cult-hopping afterward, looking for another system with black-and-white rules. I fell into CrossFit and paleo for a while because I was looking for another system to live by. **Scot Loyd:** I\u0027ve experienced that too. My deconstruction is still ongoing. I left the United Pentecostal Church in a slow fade. I went through stages of cult-hopping, embracing different theological perspectives, and coming to terms with the idea that I was exceptional. I had to realize that if I\u0027m special, that\u0027s something I define for myself. Likely, I\u0027m just like everyone else, trying to make it through life and determine what is good, how to treat one another, and how to get along. The sacred assumption regulates behavior, but we need autonomy over our lives. **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Exactly, Scot. We build these stories to control behavior. Classic fairy tales were scary to keep children safe. The stories we tell ourselves are critical to how we act and operate. One thing to watch out for is groups with anti-gossip policies. Gossip helps us warn each other about bad actors. These stories and worldviews are crucial, and it\u0027s not as simple as discarding them. It takes a decade or more to build your own worldview after leaving a cult. We need to understand why we were in a cult and its impact on our identity before building our worldview. **Scot Loyd:** Yes, like you, I was born into the United Pentecostal Church and invested a large part of my life in it. Education was my way out. One of the most fascinating books I read early on was Foucault\u0027s *Discipline and Punish*, about the evolution of prisons. He opens with an assassin trying to kill King Louis XVI. The public execution made people rebel, so prisons were designed to regulate behavior. The panopticon\u0027s design, where prisoners think they\u0027re being watched 24/7, became a model for schools and hospitals. It\u0027s a beautiful analogy for high-control groups. The sacred assumption regulates behavior, dictating every aspect of life. **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Yes, and military deployment is like a prison sentence in many ways. Initially, it\u0027s nice not to have to handle daily tasks, but eventually, you crave autonomy. People want clarity, which cults provide during social confusion. Recording my audiobook made me realize culty things about myself 20 years after leaving the cult. I had to audition for the audiobook and was convinced only I could do it. When I got the offer, I was paralyzed with fear, needing professional validation. This made me realize I had been seeking a mentor to tell me what to do with my life, which isn\u0027t a mentor; it\u0027s a leader. **Scot Loyd:** Exactly, Daniella. I still seek validation and apologize for everything, a holdover from conditioning in the United Pentecostal Church. The sacred assumption gives us something to aspire to, standing in for the leader\u0027s gaze. It\u0027s terrifying to make decisions on your own, but we\u0027re all just trying to figure out how to live our one life. Your book, *Uncultured*, was your way of making your pain meaningful, helping others with their journeys. Realizing we\u0027re not as different or special as we think is a poignant part of deconstruction. **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Yes, and the realization that we\u0027re all in this together, without sacred assumptions keeping us apart, is crucial. Leaders proclaiming sacred assumptions discourage questions. Offering certainty in a volatile world is appealing but unrealistic. Sacred assumptions offer a selfish worldview, ignoring global perspectives. When you see an \u0022us vs. them\u0022 mentality, question it. It\u0027s built into cult language, with groups claiming moral superiority. **Scot Loyd:** Absolutely. Cult leaders use familiar values and frameworks to radicalize people. Your Ten Commandments for good groups, like holding nothing sacred, counteract this. Values can be manipulated; it\u0027s the reporting you require that shows true values. For example, if safety is a company\u0027s stated value, but they focus on loss numbers, they\u0027re not prioritizing safety. **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Exactly. And to preempt trolls who say, \u0022not holding anything sacred\u0022 is my sacred assumption \u2013 approaching beliefs with skepticism is essential. I show this in *Uncultured* at a soldier\u0027s funeral, holding doubt that our side is 100% right. General McChrystal\u0027s book, *Leaders: Myth and Reality*, emphasizes that soldiers must admit they don\u0027t know for sure they\u0027re on the side of right. **Scot Loyd:** And this idea of binary thinking \u2013 right vs. wrong, good vs. bad \u2013 is problematic. Our lives are shaped by luck and circumstances. The arrogance of assuming we\u0027re right and others are wrong is staggering. Living humbly means recognizing the complexities and uncertainties of life. **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Yes, deconstruction is about becoming less narcissistic and more selfish in a healthy way. Recognizing privilege and the accident of birth is crucial. There\u0027s no meritocracy; success isn\u0027t guaranteed by doing everything right. Grasping sacred assumptions is a con. **Scot Loyd:** Well said, Daniella. On that note, we\u0027ll conclude this fascinating conversation. I encourage our listeners and viewers to pick up Daniella\u0027s book, *Uncultured*, read it, and share it with friends.

      "title": "Episode Two: From Charisma to Control: Understanding Cult Leaders",
      "description": "In this episode of \u0022Cults and the Culting of America,\u0022 hosts Scot Loyd and Daniella Mestyanek Young delve into the concept of charismatic leadership within cults. They begin by discussing how the idea of a charismatic leader is often associated with cults, highlighting that many of these leaders are typically perceived as white males. Daniella explains that while cults have been largely defined by white western academics, the underlying structure of patriarchy predates even white supremacy and capitalism, making it a fundamental aspect of coercive control in cults. The conversation touches on notable examples of charismatic leaders, including Keith Raniere, David Berg, and Jim Jones, as well as Elizabeth Holmes and Adam Neumann. Daniella emphasizes that charismatic authority is not just about charm but involves qualities that make people grant these leaders extraordinary influence. She discusses how these leaders often transition from being charismatic figures to being deified by their followers, creating a system where their personal mythology becomes integral to the group\u0027s identity. Scot and Daniella explore the psychological and social mechanisms that make individuals susceptible to charismatic leaders. They discuss the concept of \u0022front-of-the-room advantage,\u0022 where the mere act of being in a position of authority can make a person seem more credible and likable. They also highlight the role of rhetoric and persuasive communication in enhancing a leader\u0027s influence, noting how leaders use techniques like \u0022trance talk\u0022 to captivate and manipulate their audience. The episode concludes with a discussion on the importance of critical thinking and diverse social connections in protecting oneself from falling prey to cult-like influence. Daniella shares her \u0022guru gotcha\u0022 checklist, a tool she developed to help identify potential red flags in leaders and groups. Both hosts stress the need for self-awareness and skepticism, encouraging listeners to examine the charismatic leaders in their lives critically. They also preview upcoming episodes, including an exploration of the role of the \u0022skinny white woman\u0022 in cult dynamics and the broader impact of group psychology on individual behavior. **Keywords**: cult, cult leader, people, charismatic leader, leader, purity, call, Daniella, woman, rhetoric, groups, skinny, idea, charisma, religion, white, followers, book, white male, life Transcript: **Speaker 1**: This is Cults and the Culting of America, a podcast with scholar of cults, extreme groups, and extremely bad leadership, Daniella Mestyanek Young. **Scot Loyd**: Welcome to Cults and the Culting of America podcast. I\u0027m Scot Loyd, along with my friend Daniella Mestyanek Young. Daniella, how are you today? **Daniella**: Doing good! I\u0027m excited to talk about charismatic leadership because everybody gets confused by this one. **Scot**: Did I get \u0022Mestyanek\u0022 right this time? **Daniella**: Yes, you did. Very good. **Scot**: You were telling me during your time in the army that there were some gentlemen who were actually afraid to mispronounce it. **Daniella**: Yeah, I always joke that people thought I was so scary because, in the army, that\u0027s how you have to present yourself if you\u0027re a woman. People were so scared of me that everyone just learned how to pronounce Mestyanek. It wasn\u0027t until my very last unit that people started calling me Captain M, which would be more normal in the US military when you have a complicated name. **Scot**: Nice. My name is Scot Loyd, a little less complicated\u2014one T and one L. I like to joke that my family couldn\u0027t afford the extra consonants. But here we are today, and I\u0027m thrilled that all of you are along for the ride. Last time we were together, Daniella, we unpacked a little bit about your 10 characteristics of a cult. The first one on that list is something that, if you asked people what they associate with a cult or a cult group, they would come up with: the charismatic leader. So, what do we need to understand about the charismatic leader\u0027s role in a cult? And am I wrong to assume that most of these charismatic leaders are white males? **Daniella**: First of all, the acknowledgment that cults have been largely defined by white academics, white western academics. When we actually start looking at what we\u0027re really talking about\u2014when individuals come under the coercive control of a group\u2014those leaders can look like a lot of things. But the OG cult system, even before white supremacy and capitalism, is patriarchy. Coercive control, the way we see it in our world, is tacked right along patriarchy. We\u0027ll talk about this in next week\u0027s episode on the \u0022skinny white woman\u0022 who\u0027s in parentheses next to the cult leader in white-led American cults. When women are the cult leaders, as happened in my cult, Children of God, they still have to fight patriarchy, so they have to fight harder, and society celebrates more when they go down. In my charismatic leader chapter in my forthcoming book, *The Culting of America*, we are looking at your typical white male cult leaders you think of\u2014Keith Raniere, David Berg of Children of God, Jim Jones of Jonestown. We\u0027re also looking at Elizabeth Holmes of Theranos, David Petraeus of the military, and Adam Neumann of WeWork. Elizabeth Holmes is an example of someone who still had to fight harder to build her cult and maintain control than a man would have. She had to have a man next to her giving her validity, and society really celebrates much harder when she goes down and demands justice in ways they don\u0027t for men like Adam Neumann, who walked away with billions of dollars while she walked away with a jail sentence. **Scot**: And that\u0027s interesting when we talk about the idea of charisma, especially in the context of the United States. For a large part of my career, I served as a communications professor. One of the subjects I taught every semester was group dynamics and leadership, where we looked at how a group develops. What do we look at when we define the term leadership? In a cult or cultish-like group, these characteristics become magnified and are leveraged to manipulate others for harm. How do we define charisma? For a long time in the United States, if you were taller than everyone else, that was defined as charisma. Think of Abraham Lincoln, right? **Daniella**: The first problem is there are two things that charisma means, and we only think of one of them. We almost always think charisma equals charming, and also tall. It is true that more CEOs are tall. Taylor Swift is very tall. People always tell me I have tall energy when they realize I\u0027m only five-five. I think it\u0027s this larger-than-life thing. But the reality is, when we are saying charismatic leader, we\u0027re talking about charismatic authority. Max Weber defined this concept. He secularized something he saw from religion: we give people authority over us due to some qualities, some extra-human, extraordinary qualities they have. He defines two types of authority: power and violence authority, and charismatic authority. In any situation where you are given power because of qualities about you, that job, that degree, you are in a position of charismatic authority. It\u0027s not just charm. Cult leaders often are not charming. A lot of times, they\u0027re bumbling idiots, but they\u0027re good at traits we associate with charm and charisma in our minds. For example, something called trance talk\u2014saying a bunch of interesting-sounding, smart-sounding things, jumping from topic to topic. In *The Vow*, you see Keith Raniere doing this. People don\u0027t catch on. By the way, ask me what my secret was when I didn\u0027t know how to answer essay questions in college. My secret was to write three more paragraphs. The professor will forget you didn\u0027t actually answer the question. That\u0027s what cult leaders do. They eventually start turning themselves from charismatic leaders into gods. That\u0027s when we see people emulating their qualities, celebrating their birthdays like a holiday. **Scot**: And it\u0027s a very predictable road to deification as well. I\u0027m laughing because that was common for me growing up in the United Pentecostal Church. The leader of the church, our pastor, who was exclusively a white male, was always venerated. His birthday was celebrated, any special days for the pastoral family. Evangelicals even have Pastor Appreciation Month in October. If you were a good parishioner, you were supposed to laud all these accolades, gifts, money, and vacations on your leader. **Daniella**: We also see the mythologizing of the leader\u0027s origin story or the group\u0027s origin story. For example, I have two college degrees, and at no point did I know who the president of the university was until I had to meet him because I was the valedictorian. Why do you need to know who the leader of Bob Jones University is? When you start seeing pictures of the leader everywhere\u2014US military looking right at you\u2014that\u0027s part of deification and the weapon of likability and familiarity. We are friendlier towards people we are familiar with. When you walk in every morning and see your commander\u0027s face on the wall, they become more charismatic to you, and you are more likely to feel warmly toward them when you actually see them. It\u0027s why we think it\u0027s appropriate to walk up to an actress or actor in real life and introduce ourselves. We feel like we know them and love them because of that familiarity. These patterns are not original. Dr. Janja Lalich says they all went to the same Messiah school. **Scot**: You bring up exceptionalism. Not only does the leader think they are exceptional, but cult leaders play with terms like destiny and fate. Destiny has a wonderful connotation; everyone wants to embrace their destiny and avoid their fate. Cult leaders create a negative fate like hell or some version of hell\u2014poverty, unpopularity, loneliness. They create their version of heaven and say, \u0022Follow me, and you\u0027ll fulfill your destiny and avoid this fate.\u0022 **Daniella**: Yes, and with the destiny thing, they always blame individuals for systemic problems. If anything good happens, it\u0027s the cult or the leader. If anything bad happens, it\u0027s you. This trains you to think this way. I realized that cult leaders often promise something in another life, world, plane, body, or state. You can\u0027t reach enlightenment because it\u0027s a con. The cult leader knows it\u0027s a con. It\u0027s significant that Jim Jones didn\u0027t drink the Kool-Aid; he died from a bullet to the head. Cult leaders get caught up in their own hullabaloo, but their followers believe in the ends justifying the means. The cult leader knows the whole time. When we look back at all those cult leaders, we can see that since childhood, they are manipulating, building their worldview, and trying to build something with a following. **Scot**: Cult leaders exploit the need within all of us to think of ourselves as exceptional, to think our lives have meaning and purpose. The loudest and most bold among us are often the most insecure. Human nature makes us follow loud, bold people, especially if they promise purpose and meaning. They also have the stick of punishment\u2014eternal damnation, poverty, loneliness. Follow them, and you\u0027ll avoid this fate. **Daniella**: Right, I call it the front-of-the-room advantage. When you\u0027re in an audience and hear someone introduced as the speaker, you think they\u0027re impressive. I teach veterans in my networking classes to put themselves in front of the mic as often as they can. People will believe someone put them there. If nobody else is questioning around you, that\u0027s social proof. Cult leaders rely on this heavily. They\u0027ll flabbergast you and keep going. If nobody else is saying anything, you think it must be okay. When we started studying cults, we believed humans were much more rational than they are. \u0022I think, therefore I am,\u0022 like Ren\u00E9 Descartes really screws us over a bit. Humans are not rational; we hardly ever make decisions based on logic. We make most of our decisions based on recency bias and social proof. What worked for us most recently or what everyone else around us is doing. These evolutionary drives keep you alive. This comes into play with the charismatic leader. Some bigger cults have been through a thing called routinization. Mormons and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses will say, \u0022We\u0027re not a cult; no charismatic leader.\u0022 If you have to use a loophole to get out of the definition of a cult, we have an answer now, and it\u0027s called charisma by proxy. We now know large groups of people can go down illogical paths without calling each other out on it. **Scot**: There\u0027s a good resource that unpacks that further\u2014*The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Disagree About Religion and Politics* by Jonathan Haidt, a moral psychologist. One of the best books I\u2019ve read on this. In public speaking, I tell my students, \u0022With great power comes great responsibility.\u0022 Public speaking is the number one fear in America. Seinfeld joked people would rather be in the box at a funeral than give the eulogy. But if you manage that apprehension, you set yourself apart. For our listeners, to make students less susceptible to cults, get them involved in debate. It\u2019s a great activity. You can\u0027t rely solely on charismatic skills; logic is involved. It takes you out of the binary world and helps you see all possibilities. High control groups want you locked into binary thinking\u2014\u0022my way or hell.\u0022 **Daniella**: The first thing anyone will say if you call a group they love a cult is, \u0022Not a cult, free to leave anytime.\u0022 That line is both loaded language and a thought-stopping clich\u00E9. It\u0027s not true. Cults have high entrance and exit costs\u2014not always money. It\u0027s anything you lose if you\u0027re not in the group. In both the cult and the military I grew up in, leaders would say, \u0022This is not a democracy.\u0022 You are reminded everything you have can be gone if you disagree. People say, \u0022Oh, you\u0027re free to leave anytime.\u0022 I say, \u0022Do you love everything about your job? No? Why don\u0027t you just leave?\u0022 **Scot**: Exactly. When we talk about charisma and the charismatic leader, I thought about good questions to ask if evaluating whether a leader is a cult leader. These are good questions for any leader. One is, what platform of privilege are they speaking from that gives them this advantage? In our society, patriarchy and white supremacy give white males a place of status. The system was produced by people like me, a white male, for my benefit. It\u0027s important to acknowledge that. If your leader isn\u2019t doing that, maybe that\u2019s a problem. **Daniella**: Social media has been good for cult leaders. It helps people get into and out of cults. I say that in the 60s and 70s, when my grandfather joined the Children of God, if you wanted to isolate an American citizen, you had to take them away to your compound in Texas or Brazil because we all watched the same TV shows, listened to the same news. Even if you were on polar opposite sides of an issue, you shared this reality. These days, isolation can just be in your bedroom on a computer, and you can totally be in a cult. It has shifted things. I built a \u0022guru gotcha\u0022 checklist to keep myself in check. Anybody who knows a lot about cult leaders and bad guys is dangerous. People say, \u0022Should we be scared of you?\u0022 Yes, if I invite you to my compound, maybe say no. I fought the social media thing because I don\u0027t like the concept of influencers. I make sure 50% of my content comes from others. I want people to see that. Here\u0027s the \u0022guru gotcha\u0022 checklist: 1. Heavy focus on your own uniqueness. 2. Intense come-here-go-away behavior to keep you off balance. 3. Always asking you to prove your loyalty. 4. Lack of intellectual humility or willingness to learn from others. 5. Constantly blurring the edges of their expertise. 6. Trance talk. 7. Asking followers to pay for their essence, presence, or energy. 8. Handing out life advice they are not qualified to give. 9. Some form of purity from their followers. 10. Intense appearance and attitude control of followers. 11. Talking poorly about other leaders in their industry. 12. Blaming systemic failures on individual action. 13. Blurred sexual boundaries or using young women or men to entice followers. 14. Requesting followers to leave their jobs and follow them. 15. Threatens you when you leave or speak poorly of them. **Scot**: That\u2019s a lot to talk about. Let\u0027s return to purity and power. Growing up in the United Pentecostal Church, purity and power were hallmarks. Policing behavior, dress, and hairstyles of women were emphasized. It was steeped in white supremacy. The skinny white woman was the ideal image. Purity was about maintaining the look of the 1930s and 1940s\u2014no jewelry, no makeup, no cutting hair. This was preached as giving power and authority with angels and God. **Daniella**: Purity requirements are in every situation of coercive control. They\u2019re not just sexual purity but any black-and-white rule. I explain it like this: I don\u0027t eat wheat because I\u0027m allergic to it, so it\u0027s a black-and-white rule but not a purity requirement. Groups that don\u0027t eat gluten for health are under purity. Purity requirements are crucial because they make people police each other and themselves. They are impossible because humans are bad at being perfect and pure. Cult leaders themselves never follow purity requirements. They are for everyone else. They turn you into your own jailer. Purity requirements are usually time-consuming and keep you busy. Skinny is a powerful purity requirement in our society. It\u2019s a visual presentation of sacrifice. **Scot**: Speaking of purity culture, in the United Pentecostal Church, there was a big emphasis on women\u0027s behavior and bodies. There wasn\u2019t that emphasis for men. You shared part of your story in *Uncultured*\u2014a sex cult. How did the leaders reconcile purity culture? **Daniella**: In the Children of God, the purity requirement was you couldn\u2019t say no. You were not trusting God if you said no. You were letting your individuality and desires interfere. There was a comic called \u0022The Girl Who Wouldn\u2019t\u0022 training us from a young age. Outside the cult, I didn\u2019t know how to say no. Purity requirements in the Children of God involved no underwear while sleeping, women not wearing bras. Skinny is one of the most powerful purity requirements. Cult leaders want to keep you isolated, tired, busy, skinny, pregnant, and hungry. Sometimes it\u2019s the opposite of skinny. Scientology forced abortions. Heaven\u2019s Gate had no sex, no children. It\u2019s about controlling sex, not purity. Any organization telling consenting adults who they can and can\u2019t sleep with is controlling. **Scot**: I appreciate you sharing that. Let\u2019s return to the idea of rhetoric. Charismatic leaders harness rhetoric\u0027s power. Hitler is a classic example, although his style of speaking seems like just yelling. Symbolic Convergence Theory by Ernest Bormann from the University of Minnesota theorizes that people develop and move forward around ideas communicated effectively by leaders. These rhetorical visions organize and control civilization. How is a rhetorical vision cast in cults, and how do we insulate ourselves from falling prey? **Daniella**: I love *Sapiens* by Yuval Noah Harari. Religions, corporations, organizations\u2014all these groups are stories we tell ourselves. Religions are stories societies craft to explain things. Cults are not religions; they are cons from day one. Elizabeth Holmes knew she wasn\u2019t transforming blood testing. Cults are about the leader\u2019s control. Religions aim for society to work; cults don\u2019t. Religions are not comparable to cults. Religions are useful to cult leaders because they require faith, which can be manipulated. **Scot**: Manipulation vs. motivation is a key difference. Motivation is mutually beneficial; manipulation benefits only the leader. Consensual sales involve providing actual products that help people. Manipulations involve false promises. Understanding this helps identify manipulation. **Daniella**: Anyone who knows about cult leaders can become one. Wake up every day and choose to use your rhetorical skills for good, not to manipulate. Jim Jones could have been remembered as an early civil rights leader if he died in the 1950s. Instead, he chose to use his skills for evil. Charismatic leaders must choose daily to use their influence for good. **Scot**: Engaging in competitive debate helps build critical thinking. It challenges prevailing assumptions and teaches you to look at other positions. If you\u2019re in a space where everyone agrees with you, you\u2019re susceptible to harm. Ideas must be challenged to avoid trauma. **Daniella**: Social connections are crucial. Make sure your children have diverse social connections that don\u2019t overlap. High exit costs make leaving hard. Cancel culture isn\u2019t real; it\u2019s consequence culture. Diversifying connections helps navigate challenges. Understanding your own biases and staying agnostic about being the good guy is crucial. Cults thrive on binary thinking. **Scot**: In our concluding episodes, we\u2019ll talk about the importance of groups and community. Next episode, we\u0027ll explore the role of the \u0022skinny white woman\u0022 next to the charismatic leader. **Daniella**: Thanks for listening with open minds.

I\u0027m your host, Scott Lloyd, and I\u0027m thrilled to be here with Daniella Mestyanek Young, a scholar in this field and author of the compelling memoir, \u0022Uncultured.\u0022 Daniella, how are you today? Daniella: I\u0027m doing great, Scott! Thanks for having me. Scott: Fantastic! I\u0027m excited to kick off this podcast with you. I must say, your book \u0022Uncultured\u0022 has been an incredible resource for me. Growing up in a small Pentecostal cult, known as the United Pentecostal Church, your experiences really resonated with me. Throughout our podcast, I\u0027ll share some of my own stories, but your journey from the Children of God cult to the United States Army is extraordinary. Your book provides such a detailed account, and I highly recommend everyone read it. For those who prefer audio, it\u0027s available and even made it to the New York Times bestseller list. Daniella: Thank you so much, Scott. I\u0027m glad to hear the book has had such an impact. Scott: For our listeners who might not be familiar with your story, could you share a bit about your experiences? We\u2019re titling this episode \u0022Patriot Pains: I Joined the Army and All I Got Was This Lousy Trauma,\u0022 and I\u2019m particularly interested in how you compare your time in the Children of God cult with your service in the Army. Daniella: Absolutely. First, I want to clarify that while the media often labels the Children of God as a \u0022sex cult,\u0022 it\u0027s important to understand that cults, in general, share common patterns of behavior and control, regardless of their specific doctrines. That said, the Children of God did have a significant focus on sexual doctrines, which were central to their beliefs. I was born into the Children of God, three generations deep. My family was deeply embedded in its leadership\u2014my grandmother donated the first house to the leader, David Berg, and my grandfather still manages the cult\u0027s finances. My father also played a significant role in handling the money. This is all detailed in my book, \u0022Uncultured.\u0022 The Children of God started in 1968 in California, like many cults of that era. David Berg took evangelical control of sex, mixed it with elements of Mormonism, and called it \u0022free love,\u0022 which I describe as forced polyamory. The cult rebranded itself over the years\u2014from being labeled a \u0022harem photo sex cult\u0022 on the cover of Time Magazine in the 80s to performing at the White House in the 90s. Scott: Wow, that\u2019s a remarkable transformation. Daniella: Yes, it is. But despite the rebranding, the core practices and control mechanisms remained the same. I was eventually kicked out at 15, and as you\u2019ll see throughout this podcast, I was never someone who would conform to that environment. Scott: Your transition from the Children of God to the Army is fascinating. How did you end up comparing the two environments? Daniella: There are surprising similarities between extreme groups, whether it\u0027s a cult or a highly structured organization like the Army. Both environments use intense control and indoctrination techniques, which can be quite traumatic. My story is about navigating these systems and finding my own path. Scott: This is going to be an enlightening conversation. Thank you for sharing, Daniella. Let\u0027s dive into more of your experiences and insights.",

I\u0027m your host, Scott Lloyd, and I\u0027m here with Daniella Mestyanek Young, a scholar of cults, extreme groups, and extremely bad leadership. Daniella, how are you today? Daniella: I\u0027m doing great, Scott! How about you? Scot: I\u0027m good, thanks! I see you\u2019ve been super busy lately. Every time I open Instagram or TikTok, you\u2019re going live. How do you manage to talk so much from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.? Daniella: (Laughs) It\u0027s funny you mention that. When recording the audiobook for \u0022Uncultured,\u0022 I discovered I have no trouble talking for seven to nine hours a day. While others worry about losing their voice, that wasn\u2019t the hard part for me. Right now, I\u2019m talking to a lot of people about cults, which are a hot topic these days. Historically, cults thrive during times of societal change because people crave clarity and leadership. Scot: That makes sense, given everything going on. Your book, \u0022Uncultured,\u0022 is fantastic and really sheds light on your experiences growing up in the Children of God cult and later joining the Army. I recently moved to Springfield, Illinois, and saw your book featured as a must-read at Barnes \u0026 Noble. Congrats on all the success! Daniella: Thank you so much! I love seeing those photos of \u0022Uncultured\u0022 in the wild. I appreciate the introduction. As you mentioned, I grew up in the Children of God cult, which is one of the worst you\u2019ll hear about on this podcast. I later joined the U.S. Army and earned a master\u0027s degree in Industrial/Organizational Psychology from Harvard Extension School. Now, I\u2019m a scholar of cults, extreme groups, and extremely bad leadership. I compare what I do to an intelligence officer\u0027s work, helping people understand group behavior and recognize cult tactics in everyday life. Scot: Absolutely. Your book has been a great resource in understanding my own experiences with the United Pentecostal Church, which had many cult-like behaviors, especially in policing the bodies of women. These groups often use appearance and attitude policing to control individuals, stripping away their individuality. Daniella: Exactly. Cults exist for labor and control, using predictable patterns of coercive control. Appearance and attitude policing are key tactics. We\u2019ll discuss this more in our episode on self-sacrifice, but the goal is always to erase the individual for the group\u2019s or leader\u2019s benefit. Scot: That loss of individualism is a common thread in many cults and extreme groups. For example, in the Pentecostal church, the exuberant worship practices often lead to a collective loss of self, making individuals more susceptible to groupthink and control. Daniella: Yes, chanting and group activities make us highly susceptible to suggestion. It\u2019s a common tactic in cults and other controlling environments. We\u2019ll explore this further in the podcast, breaking down my 10-part definition of cults and comparing these tactics to behaviors in everyday groups and systems. Scot: I\u2019m thrilled about this podcast and the opportunity to learn from you. Why do you think cults are such a hot topic right now? Daniella: America is going through significant societal changes, similar to the 70s. People are seeking clarity and community, making them more vulnerable to cults. Additionally, we\u2019re revisiting social issues and questioning longstanding systems like patriarchy, racism, and capitalism. Cult tactics are everywhere, and it\u2019s crucial to recognize them to navigate these systems better. Scot: Well said. This podcast aims to educate and help people understand the toxic elements in groups and systems. I invite everyone to join us on this journey.
