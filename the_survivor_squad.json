      "description": "Briell Decker grew up in a Fundamentalist Mormon sect (FLDS) in a family with 14 children and two mothers. At age 18 she became the 65th wife of the Prophet Warren Jeffs. After years of abuse and torment from Jeffs and his followers Briell escaped by climbing out of a window and running barefoot to safety. After escaping the FLDS, she applied and was granted Warren Jeffs 28,000 sq foot home in Colorado City, AZ where she once lived as a wife. Partnering with the Phoenix Dream Center, that home has now been remodeled and restored to serve as a place of hope and refuge for other women and children leaving the FLDS. Briell has dramatically rewritten her script from cult victim to advocate and now a Certified Peer Support Specialist at the Short Creek Dream Center. She is happily married to the love of her life, Stevan, and lives in Hildale, UT. She is transformed! She is an Activist and is currently working with members of the Utah Legislature to create better policies to help victims of cults and human trafficking.\u00A0She is happy, healthy, and saving hundreds of women and children through her Dream Center.Briell\u0027s Instagram @brielldecker https://www.instagram.com/brielldecker/Website: https://www.brielldecker.comThe\u00A0Dream Center https://www.brielldecker.com/the-dream-centerPrisoner of the Phophet:\u00A0https://amzn.to/47K9fewMentioned in this episode:BH NovemberThis episode is sponsored by BetterHelp.
