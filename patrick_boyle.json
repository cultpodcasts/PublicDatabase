      "title": "Why The DOJ Ignored Epstein for 40 Years!",
      "description": "The first two batches of the Epstein files have finally been released, and the revelations are explosive. For decades, the media and the justice system ignored the most basic question: Who helped him? Now, thanks to thousands of pages of newly released DOJ documents, we know that there were the co-conspirators.  \n\nIn this video, we look through the latest evidence to expose the network of co-conspirators and high-powered enablers who made Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s crimes possible. We go beyond the headlines to reveal the specific individuals\u2014from Ghislaine Maxwell to banking titans like Jes Staley\u2014who were far closer to Epstein\u2019s operation than they ever admitted.\n\nWe break down the bombshell New York Times investigation that dismantles the myth of Epstein\u0027s \u0022financial genius\u0022 and uncover the bipartisan cover-up that kept these files buried for 40 years. From Donald Trump\u2019s newly revealed flight logs to Bill Clinton\u2019s White House connections, we show how a \u0022two-tier\u0022 justice system worked to protect the powerful at the expense of the truth.\n\n@nytimes  article: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/16/magazine/jeffrey-epstein-money-scams-investigation.html\n\nPatrick\u0027s Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\nBuy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/patrickboyle\n\nVisit our website: https://www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://bsky.app/profile/pboyle.bsky.social\n\nBusiness Inquiries \u27A1\uFE0F sponsors@onfinance.org\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join",
