      "description": "The February 2026 release of unredacted Epstein files is finally revealing a stark reality: while billionaire CEOs are losing their jobs overseas within hours of being unmasked, the U.S. security apparatus is still actively covering up for the \u0022Epstein Class.\u0022 This video dives de into the congressional revelation of the \u0022protected six,\u0022 exposing the truth behind Leslie Wexner\u0027s secret $100 million settlement and the disturbing \u0022torture video\u0022 emails that immediately toppled the CEO of DP World. We analyze why the FBI is still hiding crucial investigation files\u2014like the 302 victim statements\u2014while Ghislaine Maxwell receives a mysterious prison upgrade and offers conditional testimony. The names are finally out, but as this investigation proves, the cover-up is far from over.\n\nIn this video we ask who are: Les Wexner; Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem; Nicola Caputo; Salvatore Nuara; Zurab Mikeladze and Leonic Leonov?\n\nPatrick\u0027s Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\nBuy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/patrickboyle\n\nVisit our website: https://www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://bsky.app/profile/pboyle.bsky.social\n\nBusiness Inquiries \u27A1\uFE0F sponsors@onfinance.org\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join",

      "description": "In today\u2019s video, we examine the aftermath of the massive January 2026 data dump\u2014three million pages of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s investigative files that the Department of Justice maintains contain no incriminating \u201Cclient list\u201D. We dive into the \u201CSocial Ponzi Scheme\u201D that enabled decades of abuse, exploring the suspicious real estate transfers, cryptocurrency custodian links, and the international criminal probes that are currently toppling political giants across the globe. From the high-level PR strategies of the \u201CWall Street Renaissance Man\u201D to the harrowing evidence of a eugenics-obsessed operation, we explore why this long-awaited transparency should not be confused with actual justice. As it turns out, when the powerful retreat into \u201Cvast carelessness,\u201D it is often because they have spent years building a system designed to silence the questions they cannot answer.\n\nPatrick\u0027s Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\nBuy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/patrickboyle\n\nVisit our website: https://www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://bsky.app/profile/pboyle.bsky.social\n\nBusiness Inquiries \u27A1\uFE0F sponsors@onfinance.org\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join",

      "title": "Why The DOJ Ignored Epstein for 40 Years!",
      "description": "The first two batches of the Epstein files have finally been released, and the revelations are explosive. For decades, the media and the justice system ignored the most basic question: Who helped him? Now, thanks to thousands of pages of newly released DOJ documents, we know that there were the co-conspirators.  \n\nIn this video, we look through the latest evidence to expose the network of co-conspirators and high-powered enablers who made Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s crimes possible. We go beyond the headlines to reveal the specific individuals\u2014from Ghislaine Maxwell to banking titans like Jes Staley\u2014who were far closer to Epstein\u2019s operation than they ever admitted.\n\nWe break down the bombshell New York Times investigation that dismantles the myth of Epstein\u0027s \u0022financial genius\u0022 and uncover the bipartisan cover-up that kept these files buried for 40 years. From Donald Trump\u2019s newly revealed flight logs to Bill Clinton\u2019s White House connections, we show how a \u0022two-tier\u0022 justice system worked to protect the powerful at the expense of the truth.\n\n@nytimes  article: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/16/magazine/jeffrey-epstein-money-scams-investigation.html\n\nPatrick\u0027s Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\nBuy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/patrickboyle\n\nVisit our website: https://www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://bsky.app/profile/pboyle.bsky.social\n\nBusiness Inquiries \u27A1\uFE0F sponsors@onfinance.org\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join",
