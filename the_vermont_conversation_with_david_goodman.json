      "description": "In August 2000, 23-year-old Tamara Mathieu and her husband left good jobs, gave up everything, and joined a cult. For 14 years, they were members of Twelve Tribes, which the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as \u201Ca Christian fundamentalist cult\u201D that has been accused of child abuse, child labor, racism and misogyny. The Twelve Tribes made national news in 1984 when their Island Pond community, which was then known as the Northeast Kingdom Community Church, was raided by Vermont State Police and 112 children were detained in response to allegations of child abuse. A judge later dismissed the cases, ruling that the raid was unconstitutional. The Twelve Tribes \u201Csees persecution as proof that they\u0027re God\u0027s people,\u201D said Mathieu. Mathieu, her husband and four children left the Twelve Tribes in 2014. She now works for Northwestern Counseling and Support Services in St. Albans as a facilitator of day programs for adults with developmental disabilities. She has just written a book, \u201CAll Who Believed: A Memoir of Life in the Twelve Tribes.\u201D The Twelve Tribes attracted \u201Cpeople who don\u0027t want to fit into the 9-to-5 rat race of society, and they want this life of love and caring for each other and community,\u201D explained Mathieu. \u201CSuddenly, you\u0027re surrounded by this group of people who are just enamored by you who are giving you all this praise and encouragement.\u201D Leaving the cult \u201Cwas terrifying,\u201D said Mathieu. \u201CWe had lived in this bubble and raised our children in this bubble. And then to come out, it\u0027s like you are bombarded with stimuli that haven\u0027t been a part of your life. I felt like a new parent. All I had done all those years was just spank my children for everything they ever did wrong. And I knew that we didn\u0027t want to continue on that practice, but what do you do? Like, a timeout?\u201D Mathieu hopes that people who read her book see it as a cautionary tale. \u201CYour personal freedom and your ability to make decisions for you and your family is really a priceless thing. I wouldn\u0027t give that up for anything anymore.\u201D She also noted that cults are everywhere. \u201CPeople might not really even realize what\u0027s going on right next door.\u201D",
