      "description": "The Manson murders shook America to its core in 1969. While much has been said about Charles Manson and the infamous Tate-LaBianca killings, today we turn our focus to one of his youngest and most tragic followers: Leslie Van Houten. From a picture-perfect suburban life to LSD-fueled cult devotion and brutal murder, Van Houten\u0027s story is one of manipulation, violence, and decades-long controversy. In this episode, Jamie and John take a deep dive into her journey through the Manson Family, her role in the LaBianca murders, the bizarre disappearance of her lawyer during trial, and the complicated road that led to her 2023 parole after more than 50 years behind bars. -- For early, ad free episodes and monthly exclusive bonus content, join our Patreon !",
