      "title": "THEY\u2019RE CONTROLLING YOU - The Cult We\u2019re All In: The Invisible Science of Social Control with Georgia Clare -  Episode 139",
      "description": "We all like to believe we think for ourselves, but what if our most deeply held beliefs were actually engineered through social pressure and moral conditioning? The Cult We\u2019re All In explores the invisible science of belief and how high-control groups recruit and sustain members through psychological social proof. Using Georgia Clare\u2019s lived experience of escaping a structured religious organization as a lens, we pull back the curtain on the \u0022cults\u0022 of modern society\u2014from corporate culture to political echo chambers. This conversation isn\u0027t just about religion; it\u2019s about the science of why leaving a group feels like losing your identity and how to rebuild yourself from the ground up after waking up to the truth.
