      "description": "At just 18 months old, Ben Shenton was handed over to a woman who claimed she was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ. That woman was Anne Hamilton-Byrne, the leader of a secretive doomsday cult called The Family. For 14 years, Ben lived cut off from the outside world\u2014beaten, starved, drugged, and taught to stay \u201Cunseen, unheard, unknown.\u201D The cult twisted Christianity into a tool of fear and control. Ben was finally rescued at age 15 during a police raid. Today, he\u2019s an advocate for survivors and a pastor who still follows the teachings of Jesus Christ, just not the version the cult tried to force on him. You can find Ben\u2019s website, Rescue the Family, here , and his book Life Behind the Wire here .

      "description": "In November 2019, police conducted a welfare check on seven-year-old JJ Vallow. He hadn\u0027t been seen since September, and police will come to realise that neither had his teenage sister Tylee. They\u0027ve stumbled onto a web of lies that are about to unravel. Affairs, mysterious deaths, a doomsday cult, and at the centre of it all two missing children. And a mother who isn\u2019t trying to find them.

      "description": "Tia Levings was raised within the same strict Christian fundamentalist ideology as the infamous Duggar family from 19 Kids And Counting. By the time she was 19 years old, Tia found herself in an abusive marriage where the violence was sanctioned by the church. In this must-listen episode of No Filter, Tia tells Mia Freedman about the ways she was groomed to be a Trad Wife, and the moment she knew she had to run for her life. This is a story of indoctrination and survival, of reinvention and strength\u2026but it is also about the thousands of other women who haven\u2019t escaped the Trad Wife movement, and the new ones who are joining every day. You can hear the second half of Mia\u0027s conversation with Tia here. You can find out more about Tia and her book, A Well Trained Wife, here . You can follow her on Instagram here.

      "description": "The Geelong Revival Centre, one of Australia\u2019s longest-running cults, has been hiding in plain sight for years. Led by Pastor Noel Hollins until his death in 2024, the ultra-conservative church controls every aspect of its followers\u0027 lives. For the past two years, investigative journalist Richard Baker has collected disturbing audio recordings from Hollins and testimonies from survivors. They\u2019ve told him stories of alleged physical and sexual abuse, emotional stories of families being torn apart by strict rules and disturbing allegations of medicine being banned. Due to legal constraints, he\u2019s been unable to share it\u2026 until now. You can listen to Richard\u0027s podcast Secrets We Keep: Pray Harder here .

Along with no official title, the group also claims to have no registration around the world, no formal hierarchy, and no official places of worship. According to Laura, it\u0027s this secrecy and denial that has allowed abuse to flourish within the community.
