      "description": "In this episode, Dr. Doyle and Jean return to the underlying discussion of the self-help industry and the flaws within it that drive SEEK Safely\u2019s mission. It was after Kirby Brown\u2019s death at the 2009 Spiritual Warrior retreat that the Brown family discovered some of the rot at the core of this multi-billion dollar industry. This drove the family to found SEEK Safely, recognizing that the impulse to seek is not the issue\u2014it\u2019s the unethical, unregulated self-help providers that are the issue and the source of potential harm. Empowering and protecting seekers has always been, and remains, SEEK\u2019s ultimate goal.

      "description": "Bypassing is, essentially, avoidance. It\u0027s something we all do from time to time as a response to something unpleasant in our lives. But sometimes bypassing can cause us to go too far, putting off challenge for later that we\u0027d be better off dealing with now. And sometimes in the self-help world, bypassing is either encouraged or deeply embedded in the thought system being pushed. Dr. Glenn highlights how spiritual bypassing, emotional bypassing, and reality bypassing are all especially dangerous for trauma survivors. Have a listen so you can be prepared to recognize bypassing and know whether or not it\u0027s a potential red flag situation. On another note, special thank you to everyone who donated to Dr. Glenn\u0027s birthday fundraiser to benefit SEEK! We are always so grateful for the support!
