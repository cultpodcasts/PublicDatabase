      "description": "Zoom and other platforms have made virtual meetings very convenient and allow people in different locations to gather together in one place. Still, virtual meetings can be inefficient and can waste a lot of time if people aren\u2019t aware of some common don\u2019ts.

So, we talk. We talk to each other, to ourselves and to no one in particular. The process of creating speech is complicated and it turns out it does more than just communicate our thoughts. there are a lot of benefits to talking out loud and to ourselves.  We need to talk according to my guest Maryellen McDonald. She is a cognitive scientist and professor of psychology and language sciences at the University of Wisconsin\u2212Madison. She is also author of the book  More Than Words: How Talking Sharpens the Mind and Shapes Our World  (https://amzn.to/44VKNZ5).\n\nYou often hear the term \u2013 \u201Cbrainwashing\u201D but what is it really?

She is a historian of science at Harvard University and author of the book ok The Instability of Truth: Brainwashing, Mind Control, and Hyper-Persuasion (https://amzn.to/3Fw8Pzn).\n\nPrice optimization.
