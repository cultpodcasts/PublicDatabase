      "description": "This week, Gare and I talk with Cl\u00E8mence Michallon about her new thriller Our Last Resort. We dive into her inspiration for the book, her fresh take on a locked room thriller, and how she crafted a believable cult. Our Last Resort Synopsis Innocence doesn\u0027t bail you out; it just makes you easier to trap. Frida and Gabriel arrive seeking a fresh start at the stunning Ara Hotel in the secluded desert of Escalante, Utah. Once so close they were able to finish each other\u2019s sentences, they\u2019ve grown apart in recent years after a sudden, unspeakable tragedy. Now, at the luxe resort, they are ready to reconnect between dips in the pool and hikes on spectacular desert trails. It all feels like paradise\u2014until the dead body of a beautiful young woman who was vacationing at the Ara with her powerful, much older husband is discovered. When the local police arrive and suspicion quickly falls on Gabriel, Frida is forced to revisit memories from their upbringing in a cloistered cult in upstate New York, their dramatic escape, and the scandal that followed. Frida\u2019s belief in Gabriel\u2019s innocence never wavered at the time, but now even she can\u2019t ignore the evidence mounting against him. Alternating between past and present timelines, Our Last Resort builds toward a shattering climax that uncovers the fate of the murdered Ara guest and poses the question: how well do we ever really know those we love? Multi-layered, gripping, and intense, Cl\u00E9mence Michallon\u2019s latest suspense novel is a nail-biter until the last page, cementing her status as a major new talent in the genre.

      "title": "Allison Buccola\u0027s The Ascent: Cults, Murder and Postpartum Depression",
      "description": "This week, I got to talk with Allison Bucola about her new thriller The Ascent. We dive into her cult research, the long term damage of growing up in a cult, and how Ophelia\u0027s postpartum mental health contributed to the story. The Ascent Synopsis Twenty years ago, the members of a reclusive commune outside Philadelphia vanished without a trace. The mystery of their disappearance has never been solved. No sightings of the members were ever verified, and no bodies ever found. But the group did leave one thing behind: a twelve-year-old girl wandering alone on the side of the road in search of her lost family. In the years since that morning, Lee Burton has tried to put the pain of her past behind her. She has built a new identity for herself, with a doting husband and seven-month-old daughter, Lucy. No one in her life now knows about her connection to \u201Cthe cult that went missing,\u201D not even her husband. But new motherhood is proving a bigger challenge than she anticipated. She doesn\u0027t want to let Lucy out of her sight even for a moment. She can\u0027t return to work. She\u0027s not sleeping, and she\u0027s starting to have paranoid thoughts of Lucy being harmed. Then a stranger shows up on her doorstep, offering to finally answer all of Lee\u2019s questions about her past\u2014if she could only trust that the woman is who she says she is. As she digs deeper into the woman\u0027s history, the safe, stable life that Lee has constructed for herself threatens to shatter. In The Ascent, Allison Buccola has crafted a nerve-rattling thriller about motherhood, identity, and the truths we think we know about our families.
