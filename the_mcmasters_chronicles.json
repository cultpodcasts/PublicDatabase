While they would speak on Ephesians and the efficacy of grace, their actions were very different from their occasional expositions. What you did for THEM, was of the utmost importance. Not serving them would lead to messages, sermons, verbal assaults, and public shaming in person, by phone, or by message apps. \n\n#spiritualabuse #churchhurt #narcissisticabuse #financialabuse #narcissisticabuseawareness #cultsurvivor",

Using the backdrop of scripture, they would highlight how the Bible encourages communication, and thus use this to demand personal details and daily communication. What was communicated  would include, intimate, personal and private information that would not normally be required in healthy churches and relationships. \u0022Not communicating\u0022 or \u0022silence\u0022 became the ultimate \u0022sin\u0022 and at any moment you could be accused of this. Not communicating \u0022enough\u0022 meant that you were lesser and flawed. On occasion one of the leaders would post the Simon and Garfunkel song, The Sound of Silence, to scold members publicly for not communicating. \n\n#cult #emotionalabuse #cultsurvivor #spiritualabuse #churchtrauma #spiritualmanipulation #thesoundofsilence #narcissisticabuse #narcissisticabuseawareness #narcissisticabuserecovery",

This twisting of scripture specifically was and is currently being used to keep people in their congregation who love God and who want to address problems in a \u0022godly\u0022 manner. They skillfully avoid accountability by finding fault in how problems are brought up. We use examples from our leaving story to show how we tried to follow Matthew 18. Jonathan first went to the pastors prior to leaving and then we went to the church by putting a letter on the church door. However, no matter what we did, we would have always been considered wrong because the sin of our \u0022pastor\u0022 wasn\u0027t the issue, it was the fact that we were questioning their \u0022God-given authority.\u0022\n\n#church #cultsurvivor #spiritualabuse #narcissisticabuse #bible #jesuslovesyou #jesussaves #narcissisticabuseawareness #churchhurt #churches #churchabuse #matthew18",
