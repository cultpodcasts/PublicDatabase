      "description": "This Is Tineise\u2019s Story In this episode of the Irene Podcast, host Hope interviews Tineise Davenport, with the nonprofit Kindness in Motion. Tineise explains she grew up in a polygamous cult environment connected to multiple fundamentalist groups (including Centennial Park, FLDS/Colorado City, and the AUB), describing secrecy, fear of government, and strict gender expectations that discouraged girls from asking questions. She recounts that in July 1993, when she was five, her mother was life-flighted to a Salt Lake City hospital after an incident Tineise was later told involved falling from a truck, a story she came to believe did not make sense. Tineise describes how her father remarried in September 1993 to Lenora (his secretary), who moved in with five children while still married to someone else, and how Tineise\u2019s mother later returned home awake but paralyzed and unable to speak. Tineise details severe abuse in the household, including witnessing her brother being beaten unconscious, and her mother had to watch the abuse while immobilized; her mother died when Tineise was seven. As a neglected and angry child, Tineise began sneaking out and spending time with boys from Colorado City who later became known as the \u201CLost Boys,\u201D running away multiple times; at 13 she reached Hurricane, was arrested for breaking into a friend\u2019s family\u2019s house, and was sentenced to two weeks in juvenile detention. A guardian ad litem, Angela Adams, investigated abuse concerns and helped place Tineise in her maternal grandmother\u2019s custody at a remote polygamist-affiliated ranch in the Utah desert, where Tineise learned independence skills but later returned to her father and ran away again. Between roughly 15\u201318, she describes heavy drinking, smoking, living with or around Lost Boys in St. George, and feeling abandoned, while noting an uncle helped her by providing a car even though she was unlicensed. Then Tineise became pregnant and says her daughter \u201Csaved\u201D her by prompting her to stop drinking and smoking and focus on being a mother; she later left the child\u2019s father around the time her daughter was one due to an unhealthy relationship. Tineise also shares she learned years later that her mother had planned to tell Tineise\u2019s father she wanted a divorce shortly before the trip in 1993. Tineise will be back to continue her story and connect it to her nonprofit. Tineise briefly describes Kindness in Motion as focused on community connection linking people in need with those who can help and \u201Cbringing back the village\u201D motivated by her belief that spreading love and kindness helps people heal. 00:47 Growing Up in a Polygamous Cult: The Groups, Secrecy, and Control 04:13 1993: Mom\u2019s \u201CAccident,\u201D Hospital Visit, and a Sudden New Wife 07:43 Mom Returns Home Paralyzed: Living Through Abuse and Silence 10:44 The Story Doesn\u2019t Add Up: Questioning the \u201CFell From the Truck\u201D Explanation 14:19 Angry Childhood \u0026 Neglect: Sneaking Out, Being Raised by Siblings 20:03 Lost Boys \u0026 Desert Nights: Disappearing to Survive 22:54 Why Running Away Worked This Time: Making It to Hurricane 24:28 Lost Boys, Desert Nights, and a Risky Place to Hide 25:50 Arrested at 13: Breaking \u0026 Entering, Court, and Juvenile Detention 28:21 New Custody, New Isolation: Life at Sanctuary Ranch 32:43 Found Family: Living with the Lost Boys (and an Uncle Who Helped) 38:01 Two Weeks Before 18: Pregnancy That Turned Her Life Around 40:07 Motherhood, Leaving a Bad Relationship, and Becoming Like Her Mom 43:19 Wrap-Up: Kindness in Motion \u0026#43; Next Episode part 2 Irenegpt.ai Website: https://irenegpt.ai/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/irenegpt.ai?igsh=MWdwNTh0eTZ0aHNpaA== TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@irenegpt.ai?_r=1\u0026_t=ZP-91vwytSGovf Youtube: https://youtube.com/@IreneGPT?si=8An_BfZ7YKOu3BOT",
