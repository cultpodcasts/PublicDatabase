And what does this popular cultural phenomenon tell us about our own spiritual and social desires?\n\nPOULOMI SAHA\nAssociate Professor of English\nPoulomi Saha is associate professor of English \u0026 co-director of the Program in Critical Theory. Their teaching and research span ethnic American literature, postcolonial studies, psychoanalysis, and feminist and queer theory.
