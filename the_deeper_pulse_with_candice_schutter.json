      "description": "I\u0027m back. Because silence isn\u0027t an option right now. In this episode, I share how graduate study / critical inquiry into leadership and social psychology is helping me make sense of an upside-down world. Groupthink, aka hive mind, isn\u0027t just a \u0027culty\u0027 thing. For better and for worse, conformity happens everywhere along the political spectrum. I speak to how unspoken \u0022display rules\u0022 keep us from speaking up, then make the argument that Democratic leaders in Washington desperately need to ditch cultural etiquette in order to demand accountability. I also share J. W. Brehm\u0027s theory of reactance, which can help us to better understand friends and family members on the MAGA/MAHA right who continue to double down on misinformation. Bombarding them with the facts will likely backfire, and I tell you why. Lastly, and most importantly, I talk about pluralistic ignorance - what it is \u0026 why understanding it is absolutely essential in the fight against fascism. Self-regulation works great for peace of mind, but it can operate like a sort of pathology when it keeps us from protecting one another and demanding justice.

      "description": "Candice is back on the main feed with a final #gotv reminder and a deep-dive into this thing we call \u0027hope\u0027 - what is it, really? She shares about her pre-election anxiety and how she\u0027s actualizing hope in the face of so muchness. Various definitions of hope are offered, then she digs into the groundbreaking work of her late mentor, C.R. Snyder, \u0027the hope guy\u0027, sharing what she learned in the late \u002790s torturing freshmen in his research lab at The University of Kansas. What\u0027s the real-deal difference between positive psychology and magical thinking? How can we use positive psychology to make our experience of hope more tangible? And what can we learn from activists and those who refuse to give up? Also, a reminder that hope doesn\u0027t have to be about a higher power and Candice\u0027s post-election promise to you, no matter who wins.

In this one-off drop, Candice offers a summary of recent content, sharing why she\u0027s taking sides in the upcoming U.S. general election and offering perspective re: the cognitive dissonance that reluctant-yet-resigned MAGA voters are likely experiencing in the final weeks leading up to Nov 5th. And then, politics aside, you\u0027ll hear last week\u0027s unscripted drop from over on Patreon, where she shares more personally about: New age apostasy - the liberating (and terrifying) feeling of life without dogma; and why \u0027healing\u0027 from moral injuries is never really done. Spiritual high-talk - it\u0027s moving into the mainstream \u0026 despite the sugar-coated lip service, is it demonstration of true unity? Not so much. The power-player problem - it won\u0027t be remedied with whack-a-mole focus on leadership alone; we\u0027ve got to re-invent the systems that breed them. Is Social Media radicalizing us? - Candice shares how she\u0027s been losing agency to the high-demand influence of her smartphone \u0026 what she plans to do about it.

      "description": "Right around the time Candice was puzzling over how to wrap the \u0027cult\u0027ure series, regular contributor Tracy Stamper reached out to ask: Hey, Can I Q Her A? The result is the series finale where Candice responds to a long list of listener questions like: What\u0027s it been like carrying on in the face of backlash? How has this project been impactful on a personal level? Were there any unexpected surprises? And what\u0027s next? Also: Tracy offers up a somewhat surprising personal revelation. Candice speaks to the personal code of ethics she developed while producing this work. They speak candidly about the appeal of high-arousal states (vs. the maybe-middle ground), then Tracy asks Candice if she\u0027s willing to predict what might happen next at \u2018the Org.\u2019 Recovery from reflexive people-pleasing is discussed, which leads Candice to an ah-hah around the word \u0022spiritual\u0022 and why it\u0027s so over-used. When asked about leadership, she gets fired up around outdated definitions and shares why she\u0027s made such an effort to ensure the series *not* become another cult-personality led movement. Plus, many other A\u2019s to your Q\u2019s! And be sure to listen to the end; Tracy\u0027s final question goes somewhere unexpected and speaks to the very heart of this work.

      "description": "Candice is proud to welcome New York Magazine\u0027s Cover Story: Power Trip producers Lily Kay Ross \u0026 David Nickles to the pod. Lily \u0026 Dave share about the behind the scenes events that led to the 2021 launch of their investigative podcast series and about the backlash they\u2019ve experience researching and reporting on abuse in psychedelic communities. Topics touched upon in this episode include: how trauma shapes our experience of psychedelics, the way in which harm mitigation is often perceived as a threat to \u0027the movement\u0027, and the neoliberal gaslighting of victims. Lily \u0026 Dave share why the rush to medicalize psychedelics is problematic, due in part to a lack of credible research when it comes to mental health outcomes, and then remind listeners why it\u2019s important to be cautious when exploring psychedelics in communal and therapeutic settings. The roots of \u0027psychedelic authoritarianism\u0027 are discussed, as well as alternatives for folks who\u2019d like to explore psychedelics without suggestive oversight. Lily speaks to why the word \u2018power\u2019 itself can be a red flag and why \u0027resistance\u0027 is something we should celebrate. Dave shares why he loves psychedelics and the political tensions they force us to confront. In what may be the final deep-dive convo of the series, Candice finds solace in the fact that - come hell or high water - people like Lily \u0026 Dave are working hard to expose injustice and enable collective change. Lily Kay Ross, MDiv, PhD is a journalist, harm reduction advocate, and independent scholar advancing the field of Critical Psychedelic Studies. She\u2019s Creator and Producer of New York magazine\u2019s Cover Story: Power Trip podcast. She\u2019s interested in queer, feminist and neurodivergent perspectives, peer-reviewed research, and science journalism that centers patients and people with lived experience. She has her Masters of Divinity from Harvard, and her PhD in Gender Studies from the University of Otago. David Nickles is an underground researcher, harm reduction advocate, and journalist. He\u2019s Creator and Producer of New York magazine\u2019s Cover Story: Power Trip podcast. As a forerunner of Critical Psychedelic Studies, his work has focused on the intersection of radical politics and the sociocultural implications of psychoactive substances, research and clinical ethics, and novel phytochemical analysis of psychoactive materials. He is a vocal opponent of psychedelic commodification and blows glass in an idealistic attempt to avoid monetizing his psychedelic work. Dave is the former Managing Editor of Psymposia.

      "description": "Welcome to the second half of a two-part expos\u00E9 on the NAR movement in America. Candice continues her conversation with former insider, Nikki G, who shares more about the strategic aims of this belief system and how dominion theology has long been carving out a space in US politics. They touch a bit more on the Heritage Foundation\u2019s presidential playbook (Project 2025), specifically its focus on unitary executive theory; in other words, the doing-away with checks and balances. Then Nikki courageous shares about the years she spent on the front lines of the pro-life movement. She takes us behind the scenes of \u2018TheCall\u2019 anti-abortion marches - the red \u2018LIFE\u2019 tape she wore, the 12-hour prayer and fasting sessions she attended, and how she believed she was \u201Con the right side of history.\u201D Nikki reveals how her views have since changed, sharing her more nuanced understanding of the right to choose as well as retroactive realizations she\u0027s had as a Black cult survivor. Inspired by both personal experiences and professional expertise, Nikki offers TDP listeners some timely advice on how to navigate relationships with friends and loved ones who are under the influence of this radical ideology. The episode wraps with a reminder that knowledge is power. Candice \u0026 Nikki don\u0027t have a solution to the current political crisis, so they instead share how they are staying informed and taking good care in equal measure. Nikki G. is a Certified Trauma Recovery Coach who helps survivors recover and thrive after Religious Trauma \u0026 Cult involvement. She is also survivor of multiple narcissistic relationships, religious trauma, and several cultic communities. Nikki is the CEO of Nikki G Speaks LLC, which provides survivors with individual coaching, online community, and psychoeducation related to religious trauma, narcissistic abuse, and cult involvement. Nikki is a co-host of the podcast \u201CSurviving the Black Church\u201D where she and her co-hosts delve into conversations regarding religious trauma in the Black Church.

      "description": "Welcome to a brand new chapter in the \u2018cult\u2019ure series. We\u0027ll be moving away from the wellness world and onto broader culture war topics in the coming weeks. To kick things off, Candice is showing up solo. Opening with an anecdote about an awkward interpersonal interaction from a few weeks ago, she then continues in the vein of storytelling, pulling from the pages of her unpublished memoir. Through a series of intimate flashbacks, she examines how an over\u2019bear\u2019ing family system shaped her people-pleasing persona early in life and what it may have taught her about the social costs of speaking up. The episode then circles back to an early theme in the \u2018cult\u2019ure series convo - don\u2019t poke the bear - riffing on how (because patriarchy) social systems reward bullying behavior and sometimes confuse everyday allies with villains. She touches upon some hot-button topics; all the while speaking about why doing so feels so damned edgy - especially in the digital age. Also, she introduces TDP listeners to some of the folks that she\u0027s been watching closely in order to learn more about everyday activism, and why she\u0027s become a little obsessed with refreshing responses to trolls and haters. Learn what Candice considers \u0027bully backlash bingo\u0027 as well as what her ongoing fascination with whistleblowers has been teaching her. Then (sorry-not-sorry) things get political as she paves the way for where the \u2018cult\u2019ure series is headed next.

      "description": "Beginning next week, we\u0027ll be shifting the conversation here on the main feed away from wellness \u0027cult\u0027ure convos. But first, back in early February, Candice invited Tracy Stamper to record a last-minute release for Patreon, and it soon after became one of this pod\u0027s most downloaded bonus episodes to date. Flying monkey is a term popularized in cult recovery spaces. Borrowed from the storyline of the Wizard of Oz, it describes a high-demand group dynamic wherein hardcore loyalists reinforce ideology and allegiance to the group by policing behavior, expression, and dissenting opinions. But the thing is, in the world of new age wellness, flying monkey behavior isn\u2019t always easy to suss out. It often masquerades as concern and/or sugar-coated redirections that are directed toward those who are wavering in their devotion; aka no longer \u0027all-in.\u0027 And in more extreme instances, it can look like victim shaming (see Ep.59). Shrugging off good-girl conditioning, Candice \u0026 Tracy share never-told stories about what\u0027s been happening behind the scenes, and how dogma placed in service to good intentions can actually do more harm. You\u0027ll hear what it\u0027s been like fielding ongoing criticism from Org loyalists. They take a critical look at \u201Cthe high road\u201D - what is it, really?... offer a closer look at \u0027soft-power coercion\u0027... and also at how gaslighting can get dressed up in holy garb. Also, is there a razor thin line between compassion and complicity? Candice references how the groundbreaking work of Regina Jackson \u0026 Saira Roa has been helping her to wake up to her own blindspots and moral complacency. And Tracy reflects on her own flying monkey behavior back in the day, and then offers a compelling counterargument to those who\u0027d rather we STFU because \u0022what about my business?!\u0022 Which leads to an in-real-time reality check around why - despite their shared desire to move away from the subject - they\u0027re still talking about the Org. (Can we be done now, pretty please?!)

      "description": "January is Spiritual Abuse Awareness Month, and this week Candice welcomes a very special guest. Nikki G is a Certified Trauma Recovery Coach, co-host of the Surviving The Black Church\u00A0podcast, and a vocal advocate for spiritual and religious abuse survivors. Nikki shares briefly about her personal history growing up in a narcissistic family system, time spent in five different cults, and her personal path of healing. She speaks about the subtle yet sometimes critical difference between spiritual and religious trauma, then offers guidance around how best to seek support and healing. Nikki generously walks us through a brief history of The Black Church, speaking to how intergenerational trauma must be a consideration when supporting Black folks who are recovering from spiritual and religious abuse. The term \u2018church hurt\u2019 is discussed; specifically how in Black Communities, when applied too broadly, it leads to the glorification of suffering and implicitly encourages abuse survivors to stay-put and endure. Candice shares suffer-in-silence parallels in the wellness world, and the two discuss how even though the gaslighting shows up differently, it ultimately results in a similar outcome - spiritual bypassing and a disconnection from self. Nikki speaks to the many invisible wounds folks grapple with upon exiting a high-demand religion or spiritual community and then describes what post-cult \u2018rehab\u2019 might look like. She shares how coming home to her body has been so pivotal in her healing process; and Candice asks for Nikki\u2019s input on the unique challenge of healing from trauma that occurs within the space of an embodiment practice. The episode wraps with a teaser into another upcoming convo with Nikki that will be recorded later this month, focusing on how religious ideologies have been systematically shaping American politics for decades. This is a rich conversation; be sure to listen to the end!Nikki G. is a Certified Trauma Recovery Coach\u00A0 who helps survivors recover and thrive after Religious Trauma \u0026 Cult involvement. She is also survivor of multiple narcissistic relationships, religious trauma, and several cultic communities. Nikki is the CEO of Nikki G Speaks LLC, which provides survivors with individual coaching, online community, and psychoeducation related to religious trauma, narcissistic abuse, and cult involvement. Nikki is a co-host of the podcast \u201CSurviving the Black Church\u201D where she and her co-hosts delve into conversations regarding religious trauma in the Black Church. She is also the co-founder of The Black Religious Trauma Recovery Network and she sits on the board of directors for Tears of Eden, a non-profit organization that supports survivors who have experienced abuse in the evangelical community.

      "description": "This week, we\u2019re keeping our finger on the pulse of diet \u2018cult\u2019ure. Our guest is a former affiliate of \u0027the Org\u0027 and a valued contributor in the Deconstructing Dogma series over on Patreon. Susan McCulley recently joined Candice for heart-to-heart, and we\u2019re sharing the first half of the convo here on the main feed. In 2016, Susan wrote a powerful essay about the double-life she was living as a holistic fitness instructor touting \u2018body love\u2019 who was secretly struggling with body acceptance and a lifetime of disordered eating. You\u2019ll hear Susan read excerpts from this remarkable and revealing piece where she shares \u0027snapshots\u0027 from her life in a body - ie. the calorie book she discovered at 10 years old \u0026 why even as a grown-ass woman she didn\u2019t think to fire her \u201Cshitty shitty doctor.\u201D She \u0026 Candice discuss the subtle-yet-critical differences between restriction and genuine self-care, how shame and perfectionism keep us from normalizing body image struggles, and the lip service they each gave (but didn\u0027t fully embody) while teaching the \u0027Org\u0027 practice. Candice reveals how she\u2019s actively shifting the language she uses in her classes, and Susan offers up the personal mantra she now uses when she catches herself judging/comparing bodies. The two get real about day-to-day capacity when it comes to challenging diet-culture norms, and then reference the work of Kate Manne and a radical reframe they both love - body reflexivity. Finally, and paving the way for conversations that will drop later in the series, Susan shares a few ways that she is using her thin privilege to actively support folks living in larger bodies. Susan McCulley has been a mindful movement leader, artist, and writer since 2000. She is the creator of The Age of Becoming: Embodied Practices Empowering Women over 50 community which offers free movement practices \u0026 workshops, connection \u0026 community and more. Her 30-Lesson audio course, Building Balance in Your Body \u0026 Life was published on the Insight Timer meditation app in early 2022. She has two illustrated books, Buddha Cat: Learning Awareness, Presence \u0026 Self-Care from a Teacher Who Sometimes Barfs on the Bed and Octabusy: Letting Go in a Sea of Doing.

      "description": "Deconstructing Dogma is a video bonus series hosted exclusively on Patreon. Patrons of The Deeper Pulse have unlimited access to these weekly extras in exchange for their support of the podcast. Patreon donations help keep the main feed of this pod ad-free. This week\u2019s Patreon Preview features excerpts from DD #50 with Stacy Parish. Stacy was on the main feed back in March 2023, and she\u0027s back to share about how complex trauma shaped her culty experiences - as well as her ability to recognize the warning signs before wading in too deep. Content Warning \u003E\u003E This episode includes reference to sexual trauma, familial gaslighting, and emotional abuse. In the full-length episode over on Patreon: Stacy shares how she got involved with the Org \u0026 why she chose to step away after completing her second level of training. She reveals what it was like stepping into the practice as a sexual trauma survivor; how the practice felt like a godsend that gifted her \u0022a birthright that I\u0027d been robbed of.\u0022 She opens up about how, even as a teacher on \u0027the fringe\u0027 she experienced red flags; sharing examples. And then, she bravely shares about her family of origin \u0026 how it may have shaped her susceptibility to gaslighting and undue influence: You\u0027ll learn about the since-disbanded False Memory Syndrome Foundation, their VERY troubling history ( read more about it here ), and the gaslighting that Stacy endured as a result of a systemic campaign to silence victims of childhood sexual abuse. Stacy tells us what it was like being gaslit by her parents \u0026 how/why psychological survival meant normalizing the tension of two painfully opposing truths. She reveals how her original wounds may have inspired her to incessantly seek out surrogate family \u0026 a sense of safety and belonging. And we discuss how common this yearning can be. And finally, Stacy shares: How art and storytelling has helped her to liberate her voice. What it\u0027s been like for her to step into the spotlight \u0026 live her truth out loud. Stacy Parish has a BS degree in art education from Minnesota State University, Mankato and spent 11 years in broadcasting \u2014 as a professional disc jockey, voice talent and copywriter. She has been professionally involved in education and communication for almost years. A born storyteller, her popular podcast \u201CFull Spirals\u201D brings together two of her passions: using her voice as a vehicle for change and promoting the arts as tools for healing. A working local artist, she is also employed in the paint and sip industry as an artist, and her original paintings have been taught to tens of thousands of people nationwide. fullspirals.com | @boomstacy Support the show The stories and opinions shared in this episode are based on personal experience and are not intended to malign any individual, group, or organization.

      "description": "We\u2019re back with the second half of our conversation with Tara Wike. (If you missed Part 1, you\u0027ll wanna circle back and start there). In the lead-in, Candice reads from listener comments \u0026 lays the foundation for Part 2. Picking up where we left off last week, Tara shares how changing her \u2018visual diet\u2019 is expanding her definition of beauty; and also, the culty collateral damage done when we critique our bodies publicly. This leads into a discussion around mixed messages at \u2018the Org\u2019 and how - despite loads of lip service - practitioners are in no way immune to the influence of diet culture; then Tara highlights how generational differences around body acceptance may be at play. The social determinants of health are discussed, as well as the danger of insisting that wellness is in all cases \u2018an inside job\u2019 \u2014 especially when systemic barriers and biases are so prevalent. Tracy asks us to take a critical look at \u2018emotional eating\u2019 \u2014 is this always a bad thing? (Spoiler: not so much.) And then Tara shares how recovery from a brain injury revealed to her the insidiousness of diet culture. We touch upon the body positivity and body neutrality movements, and then Tara shares how she\u2019s doing her part to try and shift attitudes within her own social spheres. This is an important episode in the series line-up; one that you won\u2019t want to miss! Tara Wike (she/her) is an American expat living in Denmark with her husband and son. She is a leader in the design organization at The LEGO Group, and moonlights teaching Org-inspired movement classes, having recently left the Org after decades of practice. In both work and private life, Tara is passionate about creating inclusive products and experiences. Her recent recovery from disordered eating has inspired her to actively support body diversity and fight anti-fat bias, both in fitness spaces and in the broader culture.

Originally recorded as a Patreon bonus, Candice and wingwoman, Tracy Stamper, welcome special guest Tara Wike to the pod for a two-part deconstruction of diet \u2018cult\u2019ure. In Part 1, Tara shares a bit about her personal background, time spent teaching and training with \u2018the Org,\u2019 and the wake-up call that led her into a path of recovery around disordered eating. Topics discussed include: healthism, orthorexia, intuitive eating, how systemic biases shape definitions of \u0027health\u0027, and how Tara is now bringing a Health At Every Size (HAES) approach to her personal and professional endeavors. And stick around to the end, because Tara\u2019s wisdom is timely. Candice expresses some in-real-time raw emotion, sharing a peek into her own disordered eating and revealing how Tara\u2019s honesty \u0026 openness has been a real wake-up call. Part 2 drops next week. Tara Wike (she/her) is an American expat living in Denmark with her husband and son.

Part 2 opens as Adi reveals more about her relationship to \u2018the Org\u2019 CEO; how she saw him as a \u2018father figure\u2019 and how he groomed her for a role within the company. She shares what it was like working remotely from her home in Israel, fielding calls while trying to overlook the many red flags - ie: love bombing, high employee turnover, and teachers regularly calling in with worrisome requests. And then Adi bravely tells Tracy \u0026 I about the staff meeting that shattered her faith in the business and its leadership once and for all; sharing about the moment when she challenged the Org CEO, appalled by his dehumanizing rhetoric. Unsure of how to transition away from the work she\u2019d structured her entire life around, Adi held onto her job for another few months before being fired unjustly. She expresses what it was like stepping away; how she was sick with grief and how her classes doubled in size once she was no longer devoting all of her precious life force to someone else\u2019s bottomline. Adi speaks candidly about what she\u2019s learned from her experiences with the Org. She talks boundaries, and why she thinks she was personally vulnerable to exploitation and power-over abuse. Then, the three speak about how collective trauma may factor into: why so many women gravitate toward the practice; why the vehicle of movement is so damn potent; and what happens when \u2018joy\u2019 becomes an addictive and dissociative escape. Coming together in collective cult recovery, we seek to answer to the question - how do we heal from moral injury and reclaim a sense of autonomy (and agency) over our bodies and our lives? Adi Goren is a former Org affiliate and experienced movement teacher who is developing what she and her community know as The Architecture of Movement. She manages a dance dojo in Israel, offering classes, workshops, and retreats in Israel and abroad. Adi qualified as an architect from the University of Cape Town, South Africa, where she lived for 18 years. She is also a single parent and has been studying the practice of Aikido since 2010.

      "description": "The \u2018cult\u2019ure series is set to wrap in a few short weeks at which time main feed podcast production will be on hold indefinitely. But first, we have a final conversation to share with you. Back in August, Candice and good friend / wing woman, Tracy Stamper, sat down with former Org affiliate Adi Goren, who joined the pod from her home in Israel. This lengthy conversation was recorded prior to the unfolding crisis; as such, the intro to the episode, Candice speaks briefly to the unintended-yet-timely nature of this episode\u2019s release. About 15 minutes in, Adi is introduced, and Tracy \u0026 Candice listen in as she bravely offers the first half of her story - sharing what it was like growing up in Israel and South Africa; about her early adult life a wife, mother, and an architect; and how it is she came to discover \u2018the Org.\u2019 Adi chose to devote herself to the business and the practice, saying in her own words: \u0022My name and the Org became synonymous. And it was my identity.\u0022 For years, Adi taught classes, produced events, and helped to build a thriving Org community in Israel. After a few glorious years, things got complicated, thanks in part to the \u2018producer program\u2019 and communal discord resulting from a lack of integrity, leadership, and guidance at the top. Adi speaks candidly about her own confusion and about what she felt to be a threat to her very livelihood. She describes how, in early 2010, she reached out to the Org\u2019s founder to request mediation and support only to be publicly shamed. Adi opens up about the understandable humiliation she felt and what happened when the Org CEO came to Israel to offer his support. It was the beginning of a pivotal relationship that would ultimately shape Adi\u2019s future with the company. The episode wraps with a disturbing revelation that left both Tracy \u0026 Candice slack-jawed.

      "description": "This week\u2019s \u2018cult\u2019ure series release is a very special rollover from the Patreon-exclusive deconstructing dogma bonus series. Three former \u2018Org\u2019 affiliates join Candice for a panel discussion examining wellness-cult dynamics through the intersectional lens of gender and sexuality. Together they explore how mainstream socialization around the heteronormative gender binary is very often reinforced in spirituality and wellness spaces. In this conversation, LGBTQ\u0026#43; perspectives are centered as guests share about their personal \u0026 professional experiences. Lainie invites us to look closely at language, and at how terms like \u0027masculine\u0027 \u0026 \u0027feminine\u0027 reinforce problematic stereotypes; and she shares briefly about her experience on the Org\u2019s short-lived DEI Counsel. Troy initiates a discussion about why the Org\u0027s clothing line was/is so problematic and opens up about how an unwillingness to \u0027dress the part\u0027 - both literally and interpersonally - can limit professional advancement. Maxx speaks to how pressures around gender expression started way back in childhood and were reinforced in wellness spaces; and he celebrates younger generations who are providing to language for his long-lived life experiences. We chat about how capitalism factors into systemic reinforcement of the gender binary and then share some full-belly laughs during a lively (and very revealing) discussion about homoerotic energy on the dance floor. What\u0027s that about really? This is an episode not to be missed. Maxx Boyd is non binary, trans masculine, happily married, and a longtime friend. He was involved with the Org for roughly a decade, subbing for the Org\u0027s founders, while also teaching ongoing classes throughout the Portland metro area. Maxx still leads dance fitness classes and has since allowed their own teaching to evolve into something unique and self-defined. Maxx is also a non practicing LMT and part time customer service manager. But he spends most of his days lovingly looking after an active and playful toddler. Troy McCall licensed with the Org in 2001 and was a devoted teacher and student for many years, teaching in a variety of locations worldwide. T separated from the practice in 2011 and is now a soccer player and coach in Boulder, Colorado. Troy also dances and performs with Streetside Dance and with NewBreed Dance Company and is studying Sport Analytics and Management at American University. T holds multiple master\u0027s degrees in Contemporary Performance, Buddhist Studies, and Soccer Coaching. Lainie Magidsohn is queer, polyamorous, and a lifelong dancer and mover. She\u0027s a choreographer, collaborator, improviser, and teacher who is passionate about creating a safe space for movers of all ages, abilities, bodies, and genders to engage with their own unique dance. Lainie was involved with the Org for two decades and was also a part of the Org\u0027s short-lived Diversity, Equity \u0026 Inclusion Council, that was formed in the aftermath of the George Floyd murder and was disbanded less than two years later. Lainie is also a parent, a wedding officiant, a life drawing model, and an instructor with Dancing with Parkinsons in Toronto and across Canada online.

      "description": "This week, Candice welcomes Priscilla Eyles for a discussion on intersectional cult recovery. Priscilla, who comes to us from the UK, is a DEI/JEDI consultant who shares about their time spent in two different cults: Landmark, an LGAT offshoot of est, and OneTaste, a wellness organization that is currently under FBI investigation for sexual exploitation and forced labor practices. When Priscilla stepped away and began grappling with their back-to-back cult experiences, they immediately noticed how cult recovery spaces often overlook the perspectives of marginalized folks. As a neurodiverse, racialized, queer cult survivor, they have since become an intersectional anti-cult activist/advocate who centers the perspectives of multiply-marginalized survivors. Priscilla generously agreed to join the pod to help Candice and TDP listeners better understand how to respectfully platform marginalized voices - without being tokenistic or extractive. Priscilla speaks candidly about their own neurodiversity, how multiple marginalizations can complicate the process of cult recovery, and why culty groups can be so attractive to those who have been systematically marginalized. Victim blaming is once again discussed, only this time from an intersectional perspective. This is an eye-opening conversation, and a reminder than there really is no such thing as homogenous cult survivorship. Priscilla Eyles (she/her, they/them) is passionate about enabling the social acceptance of multiply marginalized neurodivergent (ND) people and cult survivors like themselves, as well as increasing understanding of the great value of lived experience wisdom and the importance of trauma-informed approaches. As a cult survivor who is a biracial, ADHD/autistic (AuDHD), queer femme/AFAB (assigned female at birth), they are equally passionate about normalizing conversations around cult abuse and foregrounding how cults can prey on and retraumatize people like them. Priscilla was formerly a Project Coordinator managing an intersectional disability project and is a DEI/JEDI trainer and consultant specializing in neurodivergence in the workplace. with Resolve Evolve, who has trained in DEI practice with the Sarah Jane Academy. As an intersectional ND \u0026 cult awareness advocate \u0026 activist, she has spoken at various major panel/campaign events and written for numerous publications/organizations as a freelance writer.

      "description": "Teruyo \u0026 Lennox are theatre artists in cult recovery, currently hard at work on a musical inspired by their personal experiences in a shamanic cult. They explore what it\u0027s like to break away from high-demand influence, while offering a socio-political deconstruction of the colonial headspace that informs it. Music from the play\u2019s soundtrack is woven throughout this powerful conversation, which touches upon a whole helluva lot in an hour. Teruyo \u0026 Lennox describe how crafting a musical - both in storyline and soundtrack - enables them to give greater voice and vehicle to the trauma they\u2019ve experienced. Teruyo shares: how their upbringing and mixed-racial identity primed them to \u0027cult hop\u0027 and spend sixteen years in devotion to their last cult; how the so-called \u0027Freedom Convoy\u0027 in January 2022 was the final straw that inspired them break free; and how their own internalized white supremacy kept them \u0027in\u0027 the cult and separate-from their Japanese heritage for most of their life. Lennox opens up about their own early in life conditioning, Baptist summer camps, and time spent in a coercive and controlling relationship prior to joining the shamanic cult the musical is based on. They invite us to challenge our collective hyper-fixation on narcissistic cult leaders, turning our attention instead toward understanding why it is that the \u0027spells\u0027 cultic leaders cast over us work so damn well. Music brings dimension to this conversation, as we dive even deeper into what it might actually mean to decolonize the work of cult recovery. How are our cult experiences microcosms of systemic oppression? And why is anti-colonial, anti-racism work so essential and relevant to holistic cult recovery? Teruyo \u0026 Lennox apply their neurodivergent artistry to these questions, and it results in what is perhaps this pod\u2019s most unique and sound-rich conversation to date. Teruyo (they/them) is a racialized queer, neurodiverse, non-binary theatre artist, anti-oppression activist and academic. Teruyo\u0027s encounter with cults and the aftermath of manipulative mind games have fueled their drive to delve into healing and reclaiming identity through anti-colonial and anti-racist cult recovery. Through their academic research and the creation and production of original plays and musical theatre, they aspire to amplify the marginalized voices of the global majority, foster socio-political change, and cultivate trauma-informed artistry. Lennox (they/them) is a neurodiverse, non-binary, queer theatre artist. They\u0027ve endured the clutches of multiple cults, ranging from religious and spiritual to white supremacy. Ditching society\u0027s expectations and cultural boundaries, they\u0027ve fully embraced their love for writing musicals, giving toxic masculinity the finger. Their creative outlet? Crafting badass socio-political musical stories that resonate with their true calling. They\u0027re rewriting the rules and reclaiming their rightful place behind the instruments.

      "description": "This week, Candice sits down with Somatic Trauma Specialist, Magdalena Weinstein. Originally from Chile, Magdalena spent the first 17 years of her life living under the rule of an authoritarian dictatorship. In this episode, she shares about her childhood, her family life, and what motivated her to immigrate to the US in 2004. Magdalena speaks very candidly about the challenges of being in immigrant in America, and about time spent in a series of traumatizing and controlling environments - dictatorship in her formative years that stoked an early hunger for autonomy; years spent as an Iyengar yoga student and teacher striving for whitewashed dominion over her body; and a decade of investment in a coaching program where she experienced mind control and ongoing racial micro-aggressions. She generously shares each of these stories with us, poignantly illustrating what all of these seemingly unrelated experiences have in common. In 2019, Magdalena trained as a trauma specialist; and in the final third of the episode, she helps us to understand how trauma around control gets stored in the body, and what - both individually and collectively - we might be able to do about it. She describes the differences between control and personal agency, particularly when it comes to owning and choosing psychological and somatic states. Then, Magdalena calls on wellness practitioners to trade western idealism for a more realistic and collective approach to the growing challenges we now face as humans. Magdalena Weinstein, SEP (she, her) is a Somatic Trauma Specialist that offers trauma recovery interventions using Somatic Experiencing\u00AE, Touch Skills, Neuro-Linguistic Programming, Safe and Sound Protocol (SSP), Parts Work and Biodynamic Craniosacral Therapy perspectives.

The complete two-hour convo is available to monthly patrons of the pod. In it, Jill shares: What it\u0027s been like listening to the podcast \u0026 why she chose to step forward at this time. How she became involved in \u0027the Org\u0027 practice \u0026#43; the grief, loss, and physical pain she experienced when she chose to step away. Her feelings about investing 13 of her prime earning years in the Org; she shares about the long-term impact on her and her family. The three of us discuss: The financial realities of hosting trainings for the Org. How compliance and \u0027fawning for favor\u0027 in the training environment kept many out of the direct line of fire, but did emotional damage nonetheless. The idea of \u0022badmouthing\u0022 the practice and how infantilizing it is to be told what we can and cannot say; good-girl conditioning be damned!

      "description": "As a lead-in to this week\u2019s episode, Candice spends some time defining cultural appropriation, specifically in western spirituality and wellness spaces. Then things pick up where they left off last week, with the second half of a two-part conversation with artist, activist, and educator, Aleyah-Erin Lennon. Aleyah shares why she was so drawn into the world of wellness and contextualizes how she realized she had to step away. Spiritual appropriation and misuse of \u2018the s-word\u2019 (shamanism) is explored, along with how unconscious colonial entitlement can be so hard-wired that we, white folks, can become \u0027takers\u2019. Aleyah offers a deeply compassionate approach to this topic, one that takes into account the cavernous spiritual hunger that drives appropriation; and she shares what her Indigenous mentors have taught her about how we might grow in humility and in our collective spiritual capacity. Aleyah and Candice ponder the question: How might we explore spiritual tools that help and add value to our lives without co-opting, stealing, and perpetuating colonial harm? Cognitive dissonance and emotional triggers are discussed, as well as how an understanding of cult recovery can support us in our anti-racism learning and unlearning. Aleyah invites the investigation of \u2018the poverty of whiteness\u2019 and shares what it might look like to co-create expressions of spirituality and personal growth that are relationally accountable. The episode wraps with an invitation to support Aleyah and her collaborators to share their knowledge more widely. Aleyah-Erin Lennon (she/her) is a scholar, speaker, poet and musician.

      "description": "Candice is back on the main feed, asking for help as she deconstructs the striking overlap between cult dynamics and colonial harm. Inspired by the work of BIPOC educators and anti-racism activists, she explores how social location factors into collective cult recovery. Then, artist, activist, and educator, Aleyah-Erin Lennon joins Candice for the first half of a two-part conversation that explores what it might mean, if we, as white women in the world were to take radical responsibility. Aleyah identifies as a second-generation diasporic Irish descendant and white settler Canadian who has lived her entire life in the territories of Anishinaabeg nations. She has been privileged to work alongside and learn from Indigenous communities across the Great Lakes region for the last 15 years in service to their ecological and educational visions. Together, Aleyah and Candice explore what unconscious colonial identities have in common with the cult mindset, picking apart what it might actually mean to break free from the cult of whiteness. Aleyah shares about her background and how a search for spiritual community inspired her to take up decolonizing identity work, and she cites the wisdom of Indigenous mentors who have generously offered their consent and support for this conversation. Decolonization is defined in the context of intergenerational healing on all sides of the colonial and racial divide. Aleyah shares how a threefold methodology of deep listening, critical self-reflection, and embodied action can guide us toward relational accountability. Aleyah shares how reclaiming a connection to her ancestral roots has been pivotal to her living activism and points to how we all might find a deeper sense of meaning and recovery as we grapple with where we\u2019re headed. Aleyah-Erin Lennon (she/her) is a scholar, speaker, poet and musician. Through an anti-colonial and trauma-informed lens, her focus is on healing the disconnection and abuses in the trilogy of our relationships to Self, Others, and Land. Created in partnership with Indigenous Elders, knowledge holders, and friends, her published work weaves diverse cultural narratives, story sharing, and poetry into a landscape of questions concerning our sense of identity and belonging.

      "description": "Here\u0027s another sneak peek at what\u2019s been happening over on Patreon in the ongoing deconstructing dogma series. Every week, Candice sits down with friends and former colleagues to critically examine undue influence and culty indoctrination in the wellness world, and there are now 30\u0026#43; bonus episodes available to all patrons of the pod. This episode features some of the best moments from recent releases. Excerpts include: Sample cuts from a recent solo episode with Candice where she shares a bit about a recent surge in listenership and all the feels it\u0027s bringing up for her \u0026 others over in the private After The Org recovery community. Inspired by the work of Matthew Remski, she speaks about survivor shame and also why so many folks double down in defense of the practice. Snippets from a two-part convo with former Org trainer, Dr. Barb Wesson, who joins Tracy \u0026 Candice to deconstruct spirituality - sans all the cultiness. How do we recover a sense of meaning in the aftermath of all that dogma? Excerpts from a timely convo with veteran fitness pro, Fiona Winter, who joins Candice \u0026 Tracy from Wales to discuss why she recently decided to let her Org license lapse - after two decades. Fiona also shares how she\u0027s incorporating greater consent \u0026 inclusivity into her teaching practice. The episode wraps with a sample of a long-form interview with Valerie Branch, who worked as a frontline receptionist at \u0027the Org\u0027 back in the early aughts. She \u0026 Candice trade stories about the years they spent working together at Org HQ, and Valerie delivers some welcome hindsight wisdom to those just stepping out.

      "description": "CW: This episode features reference to emotional abuse and coercion. This week, we pick up where we left off in a two-part conversation with former \u2018Org\u2019 trainer, Shannon Geltner. The episode opens with Shannon \u0026 Tracy deep breathing through their emotional triggers to offer us a peek inside of yet-another disturbing trainer training - and a group sharing \u2018exercise\u2019 that has cult-vibes written all over it. Shannon shares how it felt being publicly shamed in front of her peers, then shares how going through a divorce (and finding a good therapist) helped her come to terms with her own codependency; which delivered up some startling insights about not only her marriage, but her fourteen-year relationship to the Org. She expresses her grief openly, and shares why she hung onto the practice and her primary source of livelihood for as long as she could, until an interaction with \u2018Marissa\u2019 the Org\u0027s co-founder really opened her eyes. Shannon began expressing her boundaries and was soon after fired as a trainer. She tells us what it was like receiving her demotion letter; not only how it felt but also why she chose to walk away silently and without protest. She delivers a powerful message to her fellow trainers - current and former - who are listening, and Tracy experiences an unexpected swell of emotion that leads us into a shameless and fiery discussion about anger, outrage, and the pressure to forgive. The episode wraps with Shannon\u2019s share around her personal experiences at Tony Robbins trainings, and how there is really nothing new under the sun when it comes to packaging and selling self-development. This is long episode with lots of twists and turns, and we\u0027re hoping it opens all of us to more nuanced discussions around shared accountability. Shannon Geltner, MS has been teaching conscious, therapeutic movement for 19\u0026#43; years in the Dallas-Ft. Worth Metroplex as well as nationally. She is the owner of Compassion Fitness\u2122 LLC and she is trained in a wide variety of movement modalities, both traditional and non-traditional. Shannon did her Pilates Instructor certification in 2017 with Club Pilates in their 500-hour Teacher Training program, and is currently the General Manager for two local Club Pilates studios in DFW. Pilates certification allows her to apply her years of expertise in anatomy, giving her the ability to create fun, whole body workouts on specialized apparatus, which in turn has helped her overcome injury and heal her own body in a healthy and safe way. In addition to Pilates, Shannon is an Org 1st Degree Black Belt, a former Org Teacher Trainer, a JourneyDance Facilitator, and a Melt Method instructor. Shannon holds a Bachelor of Business Administration in Entrepreneurship and a Masters of Science in Natural Health. She always encourages her students to create a healthy, joyful lifestyle by integrating nutrition and mindful movement into their daily lives. Shannon loves the Pilates community and the conscious movement Pilates creates, and she feels blessed every day to be able to live and teach what she loves!

      "description": "The series continues with a peek inside \u2018Org\u2019 training \u2018cult\u2019ure. Candice opens the episode with a longer than usual intro, sharing details about the Org training hierarchy for the first time as a lead-in to the first half of a two-part convo; one that was originally intended for Patreon but was, in turns out, \u0027destined\u0027 for the main feed. Shannon Geltner was affiliated with the Org for 14 years, progressing through the ranks to become an NGT (or next generation trainer) right alongside good friend of the pod, Tracy Stamper - who also joins this conversation. The convo opens with a discussion about how it feels (scary AF) speaking out in defiance of the Org\u2019s cultish indoctrination. Nevertheless, Shannon shares how she felt when the company began soliciting a whole new generation of trainers, years after she\u0027d been so callously fired without explanation. Gossip is discussed, but not the toxic kind; the sort of \u2018gossip\u2019 that reinforces accountability and keeps us safe from harm. The three share a belly laugh when talking about how, back in the day, they each had to regularly offer up \u201Cbut it isn\u2019t a cult\u201D defense to outsiders who just didn\u0027t get it. And then, Shannon shares about her personal journey with the Org; her \u2018this is it\u2019 moment, and what it was like progressing through the various belt-level trainings. She shares details surrounding the first red flag she remembers, which leads into a discussion about fawning in which Candice reveals a fairly-recent experience with this doe-eyed nervous system adaptation. Shannon offers empathy to all who were (like her) body shamed in the Org training environment, then speaks to what it was like being \u201Ccourted\u201D as a second-generation trainer. Part 1 wraps with Shannon and Tracy giving us all an insider\u2019s peek into the initial recruitment process, as well as the disorienting mixed messages received once they signed on as trainers.

      "description": "CW: This episode features reference to emotional abuse, cult dynamics, and coercion. We\u2019re back with Part 2 of our convo with former \u2018Org\u2019 studio owner, Mark Frossard. If you missed part one, you\u0027ll definitely wanna start there. This conversation was recorded during Pride month and we pick things back up just as Mark is sharing about annual Pride events he led during his tenure as a studio owner. He and his former business partner didn\u2019t always see eye-to-eye, and this leads into a discussion of how social movements are very often appropriated and commodified by corporations. And how the experiences and perspectives of those who are supposedly being represented get erased entirely. Mark then continues with his story, sharing about rising tensions at the studio, as well as painful realizations he began having around his business partnership. When he finally chooses to use \u2018the a-word\u2019 and name aloud the abuse he and others are experiencing, chaos ensues and Mark is emotionally isolated from his community - and from speaking his truth. He shares details around attempts at business mediation and how it came to be that - despite being the general manager and the majority owner of the studio - he eventually surrendered to a $0 buyout. Mark reveals why he believes the Org founder was in many ways instrumental to these failed negotiations, supporting his claims with details surrounding her communications with him directly. He speaks with vulnerability about his exit and the sorrow and humiliation that he felt during his last days at the studio. Then, he opens up about his healing process - what it\u2019s been like to experience trauma triggers for the first time, and why continuing to dance has been such a pivotal part of his healing journey. Finally, Mark speaks directly to his community for the first time since leaving, reminding us all why the compassion and humility he was once shamed for is, in fact, his superpower. Mark Frossard is a creative, multi-faceted artist living in Santa Fe, NM. He joined The Org in 2010 and eventually became majority owner of a successful dance-fitness studio. Mark left The Org and his studio in 2021 after experiencing the effects of cult-dynamics and narcissistic abuse. Since then, Mark, his husband, and a group of friends continue to dance together without the confines of any particular organization or style. Currently, Mark is an Adventure Coordinator at a luxury resort. He guides hikes, art classes, and creates memorable experiences!

      "description": "This week, the \u0027cult\u0027ure series circles back to \u2018the Org\u2019. Tracy Stamper joins Candice once again for a two-part interview with Mark Frossard. In 2013, Mark became the majority owner in an internationally-recognized movement studio that became a destination for Org affiliates worldwide. But in 2021, he stepped away from the practice for good due to a falling out with his former business partner who was a rising star in the practice. Mark was not permitted to speak out at the time. Two years later, he breaks his silence, revealing details about his experience publicly for the very first time. In Part 1 of this conversation, Mark shares how it was his passion for art that first introduced him to the Org practice and the studio space that would eventually become his home away from home. He speaks about the red flags that were present in the Org training environment - as well as in his business partnership - and shares why he thinks he excused the culty dysfunction for so long. Mark recounts what it was like being one of the only men in the practice, which leads to a discussion of gender norms and a general lack of diversity \u0026 representation at the Org. Mark bravely opens up about the somatic dominance and body shaming that he experienced as a teacher and choreographer; and about how he was deliberately shut out of legacy negotiations going on behind closed doors. Little did he know where it would all leave him - heartbroken and empty-handed. CW: This episode features body shaming, verbal abuse, and coercion. Please listen with care.

      "title": "#59 - The Victim Label: Gaslighting, Victim Shaming, \u0026 Tone Policing for Social Control",
      "description": "Candice is back with another solo episode, this time asking some big questions: What is gaslighting \u0026 why is it such a thing? Why are so many people allergic to the word victim? And is spiritual dogma getting in the way of relational accountability? The episode opens with a peek into Conspirituality - and a new book by the same name - leading into an exploration of spiritual supremacy and how/why social stigmas around victimhood have become so prevalent. Candice shares personally about her long and messy history with gaslighting, and how devotion to new ageism only added to her confusion. She challenges the notion that all suffering is meant, then breaks down the cognitive biases that fuel a victim blaming/shaming culture. True victimhood isn\u2019t something we choose, and it\u2019s very often shame-inducing because of how it is culturally conflated with unlovability and learned helplessness; examples of this are offered, as well as a critical look at the impossible standards that victims (and/or advocates who speak out on their behalf) are held to. Tone policing is defined and examined as a deflection of accountability, as well as other tools in the arsenal of those who are truly \u2018playing the victim\u2019\u2026 aka co-opt the language of the oppressed in order to justify retaliation in the face of restorative resistance. This is a jam-packed episode as a lead-in to the final few conversations in the \u2018cult\u2019ure series - which will roll out from now through August.

      "description": "In part two with former MLM Coach, Jennifer Rajala, she shares her struggle to sustain top-tier status at Arbonne. In 2020, despite being investigated by the FTC, dozens of MLMs chose to leverage vulnerability and ramp up recruitment during a global pandemic, and Jennifer tells us why this didn\u0027t sit well with her. She also shares how the body-shaming culture at Arbonne impacted her personally, and why she decided to join the inner circle at Rank Makers as an MLM coach. When her clients weren\u2019t getting the results that the high-dollar investment promised, Jennifer assumed she just needed more training, so she doubled-down, powering through a series of \u0027mastery\u0027 events with Tony Robbins. Jennifer tells us what those workshops were like - the tools that were helpful and as well as the misogynistic red flags that were waving wildly. Jennifer also offers us an invaluable peek behind the curtain when it comes to persuasive marketing and the carefully-calculated manipulations that leaders use to justify coercive sales-funnel strategies. Jennifer shares why she left Arbonne and was subsequently excommunicated from Rank Makers when stress led to a health crisis and a series of wake-up calls. The episode wraps with Jennifer\u2019s message of hope to anyone who is concerned that their loved one is stuck in the world of MLM. Jennifer Rajala graduated from Michigan State University with a BS in Social Sciences \u0026 Criminal Justice. Before she was involved with MLM, she worked for State Government investigating cases of child abuse \u0026 neglect. Immediately after exiting the world of MLM \u0026 Coaching, she began speaking out as a very vocal anti-MLM activist through podcast appearances and on TikTok and Instagram. She currently works for two different non-profits (both helping kids) and loves being active in her community without feeling like she has to recruit everyone. She lives in Michigan with her husband Derek and their three daughters. She loves creating content, speaking, educating, and being a voice for others.

I got people in, now I help them GTFO.\u201D In part one of a two-parter, former MLM Coach, Jennifer Rajala, sits down with Candice to share her story. When Jennifer was pregnant with her second child, she left behind a career in social work to join the world of multi-level marketing. After a few years of high-minded hustle, she became a top-tier earner and was offered coveted White Mercedes status as an Arbonne rep. But despite her continual hard work (and the literal street cred) life as a successful MLM\u2019er didn\u2019t pan out as promised. So she doubled down, expanding into the world of MLM Coaching. Jennifer was soon invited to join the 100K Inner Circle at Rank Makers, a culty collective of network marketing entrepreneurs who follow the daily-drop guidance of MLM Power Coach, Ray Higdon. Jennifer shares how her journey in the world of MLM had her hustling nonstop, perpetually leveling-up but continually unable to deliver consistent results for herself or her clients. She describes the slow burn indoctrination of MLM \u2018cult\u2019ure and how fixation on personal mindset kept her from seeing the many flaws inherent in the so-called business model. What happens when the world of multi-level marketing collides with status-driven power coaching? Even more people get taken advantage of. A few high-earning online consultants make bank through exploitative labor practices, teaching others how to employ the same hyper-capitalistic predatory sales practices that they themselves engage in. And all of this is in service to an industry with a 97-99% failure rate. Jennifer offers us a brave and unabashed peek behind the curtain.

      "description": "This week on the pod, we explore one-on-one cult dynamics with memoirist, Emma Stevens. Emma\u2019s story begins with a peek inside of her first book - The Gathering Place: An Adoptee Story. She shares why she felt compelled to share her story of relinquishment and how the industry of adoption is problematic and \u2018a little culty\u2019 in sense that it doesn\u2019t always serve the best interests of the children it serves. Emma describes being adopted into an authoritarian family and how having so little room for individuation has made her more susceptible to cultic influence as an adult. The conversation then turns to her second memoir, A Fire Is Coming, where she shares what it was like to fall victim to a narcissistic therapist who coerced Emma to leave her marriage and move in with her. She describes how this individual fostered a slow-burn dependency that preyed on Emma\u2019s core wounds and fostered a disorganized attachment bond. Thanks to support from the outside, Emma was able to eventually move away from this relationship and take legal action against her abuser; but it would take her years to come to terms with her experience. Sobriety, in every sense of the word, paved way for deep healing, and now Emma is bravely sharing her story with the world in hopes of bringing awareness to the cult-of-one dynamics that are so common in abusive one-on-one relationships. Emma Stevens is a U.S. domestic adoptee from birth and has survived layers of trauma that have put her on multiple journeys. It is Emma\u2019s desire to be part of the movement that is dedicated to help bring forth change to the way our world views the needs and support of adopted individuals, as well as bring awareness of the exploitation that can occur by the hands of counselors, therapists, and other healthcare professionals. A Fire Is Coming is Emma Stevens\u2019 second book. Her first was The Gathering Place: An Adoptee\u2019s Story. She has an undergraduate degree in journalism and has completed Master\u2019s level course work in psychology, specializing in Marriage, Family, and Child counseling. She has two adult children and two cat children who she adores.

      "description": "This week, we\u0027re stepping outside the bounds of wellness \u0027cult\u0027ure etiquette with an honest peek behind the curtain of a multi-billion dollar industry - YOGA. Cultural appropriation. Wealthy white-centric standards of wellness. Spiritualized abuse of power. These are some of the mainstays of western yoga. Sybil Nance has been involved in the world of yoga since 1994 and has worked as an international teacher trainer, studio co-owner, and yoga therapist. In this episode, she shares some of her personal experiences and hard-earned insights around retreat culture, trauma-informed considerations, and culty norms like performative trauma therapy. Candice shares about her own experiences in yoga/wellness training environments and how an understanding of confirmation bias has helped her to demystify \u0027the practice.\u0027 Sybil grapples with her former role as a teacher trainer and how she was trained to mimic a teaching style that, upon closer inspection, was traumatizing and coercive. She speaks openly about the regret she experienced when she realized she was paying her trauma forward. She and her former colleagues have since reunited and made repairs with students they once trained, and she shares how the impact has rippled outward. More recently, Sybil was delivered a white woman wake-up call during a trip to India, and her story inspires a discussion around the insidiousness of a colonizing headspace. Finally, Sybil shares why she thinks the idea of \u0027making a living\u0027 as a yoga teacher is problematic and may be actively contributing to ever-increasing inequity. Sybil Nance has worked in the yoga world since the early 90\u0027s as a international teacher trainer, the co-founder of a small boutique yoga studio, and a teacher trainer in yoga therapy. Currently Sybil offers small virtual programs supporting women as a spiritual mentor. She is trauma informed and she sits with women as they uncover their story of origin trauma patterns. She is a mom, step mom, sister, daughter, aunt, and grandmother. She is open to the work of repair and is fascinated in how varied and spectacular that work is. web: lovesybil.com | IG: @sybil_sukha Referenced in this episode: Practice And All Is Coming: Abuse, Cult Dynamics, and Healing In Yoga And Beyond, by Matthew Remski American Detox: The Myth of Wellness, by Kerri Kelly Embrace Yoga\u2019s Roots: Courageous Ways To Deepen Your Yoga Practice, by Susanna Barkataki | Susanna Barkataki on Instagram Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator (Netflix) Support the show The stories and opinions shared in this episode are based on personal experience and are not intended to malign any individual, group, or organization.

Excerpts include: a critical look at day-one Org teachings and what happens when helpful tools meant to liberate self-expression do just the opposite; coercive marketing and recruitment practices and how they\u2019re used to justify exploitative labor practices down the road (and up the hierarchy); culty language and how damn difficult it can be to lose the lingo and learn to think critically again; and \u2018triple isolation\u2019 what it is and how to recover from it. You\u0027ll hear more from Monica Welty in a Patreon-exclusive bonus where she and Candice continue their main feed conversation and discuss how to make meaning without making shit up. Former Org trainer, Maria Skinner, joins the pod and poses some hard questions about Org leadership and the differences between transparency and TMI. Also, a sample from a recent two-part Patreon release with yoga mentor and former yoga teacher trainer, Sybil Nance. Sybil and Candice discuss retreat red flags and how to make repairs in the aftermath of our inherited trauma. And then the episode wraps with an intro to Susan McCulley, who\u2019s up next in the deconstructing dogma series. Patreon donations keep the podcast ad-free.

      "description": "One year ago, Monica Welty shared her story with TDP listeners on the pod - see Ep.29 Grief \u0026 Gratitude - and now she\u2019s back for another heart-to-heart about moving on after loss. Candice opens the episode with a commentary on spiritual bypassing, and then Monica joins her to share recent insights she\u2019s been having in her own process of cult recovery. Monica spent a decade training at \u2018the Org\u2019 in addition to other new age wellness circles, all of which emphasize radical body awareness, the law of attraction, and magical thinking. She describes how her grief was compounded by new age indoctrination when she tragically lost her newborn son, her fertility, and her marriage; and how despite the initial benefits, her new age worldview came crashing down. Monica also opens up about how childhood conditioning combined with a culturally-absorbed pressure to spiritually bypass contributed to denial surrounding her husband\u2019s ongoing infidelities, and Candice chimes in with her own personal reckoning with cult of one relational dynamics. Candice shares how she has restored agency when it comes to trusting her instincts on the other side of her culty experiences; and then together she and Monica discuss the dangers of the new age there-are-no-victims mindset, how it\u2019s shaped by privilege, and why it\u2019s so important to seek out spaces where we can show up authentically. This conversation a two-parter; the second half rolls out over on Patreon later this week when Monica \u0026 Candice pick up where they left of with a discussion on what it\u0027s like to find meaning on the other side of new age disillusionment.

      "description": "CW: This episode contains descriptions of child abuse and reference to addition, mental illness, and suicide. Please listen with care. In December of last year, I released my conversation with Trina Studebaker who shared about the fourteen years she and her family spent an abusive religious cult (see episode #42). In addition to offering a refreshingly-honest peek into her own personal journey, Trina spoke about her regrets as a mother; how due to cultic indoctrination, she\u2019d been unable to protect her children from the wrath of the cult\u0027s fundamentalist rhetoric and the heavy hand of their father who had himself been raised in the group. Trina wept as she described the terror that had been unleashed on her eldest child, Christian. Not long after #42 dropped, Christian requested the opportunity to offer his own honest-yet-hopeful perspective, and it\u2019s an honor to share his story with you today. His is a story that is difficult to hear, but remarkably inspiring. Christian speaks candidly about what it was like living in a home where he was continually beaten and gaslit around the helpless rage he experienced as a result of ongoing abuse. He shares how he spent the first half of his life internalizing the messages he received at home and at school and how he escaped the pain through addiction before turning a corner through 12-step recovery and trauma-informed therapy. Christian has since healed his relationship with his father and reclaimed his right to love, compassion, and opportunities that were once unimaginable. Listen in on his uncommon journey from solitary confinement as a ten-year old to the Graduate in Architecture program at MIT. Christian bravely reminds us that it\u0027s possible to heal, and to build a bridge from resilience to recovery.

      "description": "At age sixteen, Lindsay Spyker woke in the middle of the night to two strangers hovering over her bed and by order of her parents, she was transported to Cross Creek - a youth \u2018rehabilitation\u2019 center in La Verkin, Utah where she would spend the next two years of her life. Today, she shares her harrowing experience with us. The \u0027troubled teen\u0027 industry is a multi-billion dollar money machine that preys on parental anxiety and uses deceptive marketing tactics to sell a high-dollar dogmatic approach to \u2018treatment\u2019 wherein children are separated from their families and indoctrinated to believe that they are flawed and in need of fixing. Each year, countless youth are sent to therapeutic boarding schools, youth rehab centers, and conversion camps, many of which are led by untrained staff and special interests groups. There have been tens of thousands of reports of abuse and psychological coercion in these environments spanning many decades; and yet, they continue to operate across the US and abroad. Breaking Code Silence - now known as Unsilenced - has been shining a spotlight on survivor stories since 2014, and Lindsay is here today to share her experience with us and to advocate for accountability and widespread legislative change. She shares what it was like for her as a \u2018uncontrollable\u2019 child as well as the terror of being sent away as a teen. She offers a peek behind the curtain at Cross Creek and shares openly about the abuse she witnessed and suffered there. Today\u2019s episode is bid for collective activism on behalf of children everywhere and a cautionary tale reminding us all (parents especially) that youth rehab facilities aren\u2019t always what the shiny brochures promise them to be.

      "description": "Stacy Parish is this week\u2019s guest on the pod. Stacy is an artist, and the creator and host of the Full Spirals podcast. In this wholehearted convo, she \u0026 Candice discuss how Stacy\u2019s experiences in early childhood shaped her passion for creative expression as both voice and vehicle for healing. Stacy repressed memories of the early childhood trauma that she experienced; and in her thirties, an ongoing battle with addiction required she unearth them in order to heal. She was gaslit by her immediate family, which was an experience that left an indelible mark. In this conversation, Stacy speaks to why she feels it\u2019s so crucial (and difficult at times) to trust ourselves. Stacy also spent time in \u2018the Org\u2019 and she explains why, despite the remarkable benefits of the practice, her experiences elsewhere kept her at a healthy distance from the inner circle. From there, the conversation centers around the two decades that Stacy spent in 12-step recovery communities. She explains what worked about it, what didn\u0027t, and why she made the difficult choice to walk away two years ago. The two discuss everyday cult dynamics that show up in these communities, including: commitment expectations, boundary violations, and bounded choice... just to name a few. The \u0027cult of personality\u0027 is also explored, as well as some of the harmful consequences that can result when this power is abused and the cycle of pain is perpetuated by people who refuse to look outside of group dogma for answers. CW: This episode includes reference to addiction and childhood sexual abuse. It may be triggering to trauma survivors, those in 12 step recovery programs, or anyone who has experience in high-demand groups or emotionally coercive relationships. Please listen with care. Stacy Parish has a BS degree in art education from Minnesota State University, Mankato and spent 11 years in broadcasting \u2014 as a professional disc jockey, voice talent and copywriter. She has been professionally involved in education and communication for almost years. A born storyteller, her popular podcast \u201CFull Spirals\u201D brings together two of her passions: using her voice as a vehicle for change and promoting the arts as tools for healing. A working local artist, she is also employed in the paint and sip industry as an artist, and her original paintings have been taught to tens of thousands of people nationwide. fullspirals.com | @boomstacy Referenced in this episode: Full Spirals Podcast Interview w/ Candice on Full Spirals Podcast Writing Down The Bones: Freeing The Writer Within, by Natalie Goldberg Untamed, by Glennon Doyle The 13th Step, a film by Monica Richardson Support the show The stories and opinions shared in this episode are based on personal experience and are not intended to malign any individual, group, or organization.

      "description": "Candice returns with the second half of her convo with new friends of the podcast and co-founders of the #igotout movement, Lisa \u0026 Gerette. If you missed part one, circle back because the conversation picks up where it left off. Gerette shares what a relief it is \u0027being human\u2019 after 18 years spent striving to perfect herself in a therapy-based cult. Lisa acknowledges activists who are blowing the whistle on her very first guru, who has since rebranded himself. Candice wonders aloud at how so many wellness influencers rely on spiritual lineages that reinforce oppressive ideologies, referencing her own recently discovered blindspots. Gerette inspires a discussion about healthy leadership - what is it and how do we create it? Then Lisa emphasizes the importance of deconstructing hierarchies, sharing personally about the learning curve she has faced as the #igotout content curator. She reads aloud from Geoffrey Wallace\u2019s book - A Voice From Inside - which inspires a lively dialogue about the power of creativity and critical thinking. Candice shares how she was discouraged from asking questions in new age wellness circles, and Gerette voices an encouraging open-invitation to us all. The three discuss why collaboration and organic growth is so critical to the reinvention of leadership; then, Lisa speaks in depth about anonymous activism, providing a helpful template for easing our way into cult recovery spaces. The episode wraps with a peek into the collaborative future of the igotout movement. Gerette \u0026 Lisa are co-founders of igotout.org, which serves as a platform for the voices of the isolated, silenced, and invisible\u2026and as a hub and amplifier for ex-cult related advocacy. The hashtag, #igotout, connects survivors of all kinds of power-over abuse and creates a web of support and access to resources for healing and community.

      "description": "The \u2018cult\u2019ure series continues with a a two-part conversation with the co-founders of igotout.org. In Part 1, Candice shares how #igotout was a saving grace when she first released her story publicly. Lisa \u0026 Gerette join her to share about the origins of the movement, speaking about the hashtag\u2019s conception and why it is so important for cult survivors to have safe spaces to share their stories. Gerette makes a distinction between recognizing and \u2018reckoning with\u0027 the harm we experience, and Lisa speaks to why anonymous activism is something she continually champions. Candice shares how the idealism that hooked her is also what enabled her to get out, and Lisa expands upon this with a potent declaration that bears repeating. The three discuss how involvement in cult communities and abusive relationships very often results in arrested development; how we stop thinking critically and our fears are leveraged and used against us. Carlos Castaneda\u2019s influence is explored through a peek into Lisa\u2019s childhood and family history, and she shares intimately how growing up in the hippie movement primed her for entry into a cult at age 19. And a fascinating dialogue about death leads Gerette toward a personal ah-ha around how grief shaped her exit from a a therapy-based cult. The episode wraps with a sneak peek at part two, which drops next week. Gerette Buglion , co-founder of igotout.org, is a spokesperson for the #igotout movement, co-manages day to day operations and communications while also providing her expertise in Cult Recovery and Education. Gerette is creator and facilitator of Writing to Reckon - and offers free classes for people to write their #igotout statement in a supportive environment. Gerette\u2019s educational memoir, An Everyday Cult was published in May 2021. Lisa co-founded igotout.org as an anonymous cult-survivor activist with the intention of creating a space for victims of high control environments to safely share their stories...in whichever way supports their healing. Lisa co-manages communications and is the main point of contact for messaging on the igotout social media platforms. She is a generator of community building initiatives within the #igotout space.

      "description": "In the final episode before a self-care break, Candice is thrilled to sit down with Kathleen Oh, a fellow writer, coach, and new-age wellness survivor. Kathleen lays the foundation for her cult-like experiences, sharing how she was born into high-control environments. She opens up about how the resulting black\u0026white thinking shaped her choices at home as a young mother, and as in her work as a coach. Kathleen expresses her regret and speaks openly about how she is still coming to terms with the ways in which she spread misinformation and unknowingly used coercive sales tactics. She and Candice trade stories about the love\u0026light \u2018cult\u2019ures they occupied, underscoring just how much the lies they learned - and helped to perpetuate through their work - are really just a byproduct of capitalist-cult, supremacist self-help rhetoric. Kathleen breaks down the real differences between therapy and coaching and shares how she learned (the hard way) what can happen when coaches are not, in fact, trauma-informed. Candice shares about the boss-babe business training she invested in, and Kathleen has an even more humbling story to share when it comes to predatory sales practices. The episode wraps with a variety of resources for folks who want to learn more about a small-yet-growing counterculture of coaches who are calling themselves, and one another, \u2018out\u2019\u2026 with the hope of mitigating the culty and harmful business practices that run rampant in the coaching industry. Kathleen Oh (she/her) is a Coach, writer, and safe drug use advocate and educator specializing in psychedelic integration. She offers coaching services focusing on the continued care and well-being of clients from high-stress, high-performance careers as the center of their work. She practices trauma-informed and integrative, positive psychology, solution-focused coaching and Internal Family Systems Informed approaches informed by an anti-oppressive framework. Kathleen openly practices as a learner and student of cultic studies. She is continuing to decondition and recover from systems of cultic indoctrination. This combination of skills is uncommon in coaching communities. She has lost close friends and relationships with her community members to controversial conspiracy groups. ohmyheart.substack.com | coachkathleenoh.com | IG: @therealcoachoh Referenced In This Episode: Lalich Center on Cults \u0026 Coercion Gerette Buglion, Writing to Reckon Maggie Patterson on IG @smallbusiness boss Support the show The stories and opinions shared in this episode are based on personal experience and are not intended to malign any individual, group, or organization.

We\u0027re sharing it publicly because this chat is timely; right on the heels of a pivotal convo with Yamuna Benedict - where so many of the Org\u0027s unspoken rules of engagement were broken (sorry, not sorry). Tracy \u0026 Candice unpack three major no-no\u2019s at the Org - gossiping, complaining, and \u2018creating drama.\u0027 They discuss how often helpful signposts for self-awareness were misunderstood and misused, often resulting in silence and complacency. Tracy shares how hypervigilance around self-expression is antithetical to \u2018see something, say something\u2019 reminders that we have a responsible to speak up when something ain\u0027t right. Candice speaks to the importance of nervous system co-regulation and points toward a painful truth; that social guidelines are too often about reinforcing a \u2018cult\u2019ure of compliance, obedience, and top-down whitewashed supremacy. Tracy does her best to shed the stigma when it comes to the \u2018work-arounds\u2019 we employ to forge connection, and Candice attempts to normalize feelings of guilt or shame that some folks might feel even listening to the podcast. The episode wraps with a critical examination of purity \u2018cult\u2019ure and what an ongoing rejection of \u2018drama\u2019 really means... and why the cost is just too damn high.

      "description": "Yamuna Benedict is back to share Part 2 of her story. Tracy offers a telling reflection to kick things off regarding how Yamuna\u2019s Krishna-cult conditioning may have contributed to long hours at \u0027the Org.\u0027 Yamuna describes the demanding and chaotic work environment, as well as some disturbing details regarding the Org\u2019s discriminatory hiring practices, chronic gaslighting, and overt body shaming. She shares candidly about fielding ongoing sexual harassment claims and explains why she chose not to support a harassment lawsuit against the company early on. Yamuna describes how her codependent connection to the Org\u2019s CEO mimicked her early-in-life relationship with her father, which may explain why she continually shielded him, and the Org\u0027s founder, from accountability. She talks candidly about keeping up appearances in order to make sure that no one could see \u0027behind the curtain.\u0027 Candice asks for the backstory surrounding the infamous bathing suit exercise that Tracy described in Ep.34, and the three speak about just how often abuse of power was reframed as an exercise in psychospiritual endurance. Finally, after eight years of silence, Yamuna shares the details around her sudden and painful termination from the Org, the devastation she experienced, as well as how she was regarded by those still \u2018in.\u2019 Reflection on the aftermath leads into a fiery discussion about whether or not the \u2018the moves\u2019 explored at the Org are proprietary (spoiler: they\u2019re not), and Candice shares why she believes that lifetime membership fees - for any reason - are culty AF. Tracy reveals what her own research has taught her about susceptibility to cult dynamics, and then the episode wraps when Yamuna shares what she\u2019s doing to heal and move her life forward. This episode is jam-packed and it offers a (deep) breath of fresh air for anyone previously or currently involved with \u2018the Org\u2019 or any other new age wellness cult.

      "description": "According to Hare Krishna tradition, a \u2018devadasi\u2019 is a female who devotes herself to a lifetime of service. Upon her birth, this week\u2019s guest was given the name Yamuna Jivana Devi Dasi by the founder of ISKCON, Swami Prabhupada. Yamuna\u2019s parents ran the Berkeley Hare Krishna Temple when she was a child, and she grew up believing that her purpose in life was \u201Cto be a servant to the servant to the servant.\u201D She carried this foundational approach to life with her into adulthood, and it has delivered some mixed-bag results. Tracy Stamper (see Ep.34-37) rejoins Candice on the podcast to welcome Yamuna, who was once an \u2018Org\u2019 executive team member, trainer liaison, and all-around go-to gal. Yamuna was drawn into the inner circle at \u0027the Org\u0027 in 2010, a pivotal time in the company\u0027s growth. True to form, she went \u2018all-in\u2019 devoting her devidasi spirit to the company\u0027s mission. She worked overtime - underpaid - for five years before being let go with staggering insensitivity (a story she\u0027ll share in Part 2). Eight years later, Yamuna is ready to step out from the shadows and break her unspoken vow of silence. Not to \u201Cgossip, complain, or create drama\u201D (see Org\u2019s implicit-rule book for thought-terminating cliches on all that) but to liberate herself from a cycle of self abandonment that existed before and after her time at the Org. She hopes that sharing the details of her experience might help her and others to better understand why so many of us are drawn into cultish communities, and also... why we stay put when the red flags are impossible to ignore.

      "description": "You may recognize Sarah Edmondson and Anthony \u2018Nippy\u2019 Ames from the critically-acclaimed HBO docu-series, The Vow. Sarah \u0026 Nippy left a self-development organization known as NXIVM in 2017, and they were immediately thrust into the spotlight, working alongside a handful of other whistleblowers to bring NXIVM\u2019s leader, Keith Raniere, to justice. In this episode, Sarah and Nippy speak candidly about the NXIVM curriculum, where it came from (really), what they thought it was, and how it was eventually weaponized against them. Nippy shares his take on NXIVM\u2019s \u2018exploration of meaning\u2019 exercise, and Sarah shares how - despite the early benefits of EMing - the technique was eventually used to coerce her into getting a \u2018sisterhood\u2019 brand on her body. Candice shares how much she can relate to the mindfuckery of always \u201Cbeing at-cause\u201D and how she\u2019s still unraveling it after 16 years. Nippy elaborates, speaking to how this no-victim mentality feeds shame - which is then leveraged to keep people from leaving or speaking out. Sarah breaks down NXIVM\u2019s Stripe Path - which is uncannily similar to \u2018the Org\u2019 hierarchy - and then shares about a moment when Keith Raniere revealed the truth aloud to her - referring to it as something meant to offer \u0022the illusion of hope.\u0022 Nippy gets uber-honest about the anger he felt when he learned his wife had been branded, and Sarah shares openly about her lingering PTSD and how it\u0027s impacted her most intimate relationships. The episode wraps with a disarming response to folks who only want to \u2018focus on the good.\u2019 Listen in for a crash course in self-development-cult survivorship. [CW: This episode contains brief reference to physical and sexual coercion.] Sarah Edmondson ( @sarahedmondson ) and Anthony \u201CNippy\u201D Ames ( @anthonyames11 ) are NXIVM survivors who co-host the A Little Bit Culty podcast where they talk about things that are... a little bit culty. Or in their case: a whole bunch of culty. As whistleblowers documented in the critically-acclaimed HBO series \u201CThe Vow,\u201D Sarah and Nippy have a lot to say about their experience, and burning questions to ask people with similar stories. They\u2019re here to help people understand, heal from, and avoid abusive situations one little red flag at a time. Listen in as they share their stories, have frank and unscripted conversations with other survivors and cult experts, and do a deep dive on how devotion can turn to dysfunction.

      "description": "CW: This episode contains reference to physical and sexual abuse, mental illness, and mention of suicide. Please listen with care. It takes a tremendous amount of self-inquiry to get to a place in recovery where you can finally use the four-letter word - cult - and Trina Studebaker has done the work. In this episode, Trina bravely shares her life story with us. It\u0027s a story of cultic influence that starts early-in-life with sexual abuse and an ongoing battle with anorexia, culminating in an all-in devotion to Christian Fundamentalism. Trina shares how she first got involved with the group; how it hooked her, made use of her many talents, and why it felt impossible to leave despite the devastating toll it was taking on her family; courageous to the bone, Trina shares a number of shameful secrets for the first time. After 14 years, she and her family eventually left the group, only to find themselves in another non-religious-yet-culty situation that resulted in Trina being asked to testify against someone she\u0027d long considered a friend, mentor, and respected leader in her community. Trina shares how she survived it all - including a suicide attempt in 2010 - and speaks poignantly about her continual path of healing - which has required a painful reckoning with chronic pain, shame, and bittersweet resiliency. This conversation is highly illustrative; together Candice \u0026 Trina touch upon many tools of \u2018cult\u2019ural indoctrination as identified in previous episodes, including: undue influence, control of language, and how we go about recovering a sense of inner authority when there\u0027s so much good mixed in with the bad.

      "description": "Candice welcomes friend and activist Jamie Smith to the podcast for an illuminating discussion on the \u2018cult\u2019ure of MLM. Jamie spent four years as a sales rep with d\u014DTERRA, a multi-level marketing company known for its high-end essential oils. She shares when she became involved in the company - while battling postpartum depression and shortly after the death of her father - as well as what drew her into work as a distributor. As a health coach, Jamie found d\u014DTERRA\u2019s emphasis on health education to be a major selling point, but soon enough she\u0027d be spending the majority of her (unpaid) time recruiting new distributors. Despite loads of lip service from top-line mentors, Jamie began to see through the gauzy promises and eventually left the world of MLM for good. A few years later, she realized that very few anti-MLMers were naming d\u014DTERRA - an MLM who, in Jamie\u0027s own words, has taken great pains to \u201Cpolish the turd\u201D - so she began speaking out publicly on social media. Jamie insists that multi-level marketing is across-the-board problematic, calling it \u201Ccapitalism on steroids,\u201D and she shares the red flags to look out for when being pitched. Candice and Jamie also discuss pay-to-play privilege in the wellness world, as well as how they were both trained in coercive sales strategies in the coaching industry. They trade some real-talk on magical thinking, and the way in which they were each taught to believe that their business failings were a result of faulty vibes - versus a rigged system - and they discuss moral injuries and how they\u2019re each learning to trust themselves again. Jamie pitches the idea of a \u2018rest mindset\u2019 versus all the endless self-helping, and together they discuss how gate-keeping (and other culty bs) sometimes bleeds into their cult recovery circles. Candice wonders aloud if the evolving business structure at \u2018the Org,\u2019 might also be a little MLM-ish, then the episode wraps with some helpful advice - what to do when you\u0027re pitched a product membership that sounds too good to be true (spoiler: it definitely is). Jamie Smith is a former d\u014DTERRA \u2018Wellness Advocate\u2019 turned anti-MLM advocate, helping to promote changes to protect consumers from pyramid schemes. She likes to joke that her d\u014DTERRA \u0027business\u0027 didn\u2019t quite work out, so she finally made the transition to a real career in interior design.

      "description": "In another solo episode of the \u0027cult\u0027ure series, we take a deep-dive into childhood conditioning and explore how \u2018family systems\u2019 might shape susceptibility to influence. Candice shares a recent ah-hah around her \u0027triggers\u2019 and how allowing herself to feel has been helping her to step outside of culty indoctrination. Complacency is discussed, as the near enemy of mindfulness and as a roadblock to authentic self-awareness. Inspired by the work of John Bradshaw, Candice shares how to tell the difference between healthy and toxic shame, and how the latter reinforces \u0027the cult persona,\u0027 and a tendency to act as if we are more or less than human. She then shares what it\u2019s like living just outside of Sedona - a new-age mecca that wreaks of \u0027cult\u0027ural appropriation. Find out the history behind Sedona\u2019s claim to fame - the energetic vortexes, and what the spiritual ego has to do with it all. Finally, be sure to stick around, because the episode wraps with the poignant (and anonymous) sharing of former Org members\u0027 stories. Purity culture is reality checked, orthorexia is defined, and a wake-up call is inspired by the work of courageous body-positive activists who are calling out the cults of ableism and anti-fat bias.

      "description": "Candice sits down with world-renowned cult expert Dr. Janja Lalich -- who retired for a hot minute in 2019 until the pandemic hit and her inbox began blowing up. The episode opens with Janja\u2019s personal story about her involvement in a far-left political cult back in the late \u201970s \u0026 early \u002780s. She shares about her role in leadership and the eventual disbanding of the group, speaking candidly about the mental health challenges she faced during her own cult recovery. Dr. Lalich shares some of what she\u0027s learned working as an expert in cults \u0026 coercive influence for over three decades, including a brief history of the human potential movement and how it\u2019s since morphed into present-day conspirituality culture. Large group awareness trainings are a byproduct of this modern-day self-help economy, and Janja describes how LGATs alter judgment and erode personal agency in real-time. She highlights some of the red flags to look out for when it comes to cultic influence, as well as the #1 thing that people who join cults appear to have in common (it\u2019s probably not what you think). Candice shares how she regrets moving from one wellness cult to another in her late twenties and early thirties, and Janja underscores the importance of psychoeducation to avoid this common \u2018cult hopping\u2019 tendency. Other topics covered include peak experiences and why they\u2019re so addictive, common misconceptions about coercion, what makes us vulnerable when it comes to recruitment, and Janja\u2019s groundbreaking bounded choice framework. Finally, Janja celebrates Candice\u0027s recent decision not to consult with those who are still hoping to change things at the Org - a \u0027cult\u0027ure she\u0027s spoken about in-depth in previous episodes. This is a jam-packed conversation and is quite arguably the seminal episode in the \u2018cult\u2019ure series. Janja Lalich, Ph.D., Professor Emerita of Sociology, is an international authority on cults and coercion. Researcher, author, and educator, she specializes in recruitment, indoctrination, and coercive methods of influence and control. Dr. Lalich is the author and/or coauthor of six books, including the now classic, Take Back Your Life: Recovering from Cults and Abusive Relationships. In addition to working with survivors and their families, she leads workshops and educational sessions for government agencies, international intelligence agencies, private companies, educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and leads online psychoeducational courses for trauma survivors, families, and mental-health professionals. She has also served as an expert witness in civil and criminal legal cases.

      "description": "Candice \u0026 Tracy reunite nearly six months after recording their previous convo. They discuss what it\u2019s been like sharing their stories \u0026 unpack major takeaways on the other side of a transformative few weeks. Tracy shares new perspective on the tools-turned-weapons of self-help, along with a vision of how she\u0027d like to do group culture differently in the future. Candice speaks about two nervous system adaptations commonly overlooked in group training environments - fawning \u0026 freezing. She describes the distress signals she often witnessed at the Org, calls herself out for staying silent, and cites the work of Robert Jay Lifton regarding the \u2019sacred science\u2019 of culty culture and the limitations of new age spirituality jargon. Tracy examines why, after four-plus years, she\u2019s still unable to teach or attend movement classes, and the two adamantly agree that spiritual authority is an inside job. Tracy shares why she thinks the idea of \u2019spiritual hustle\u2019 is a total misnomer, and Candice speaks critically about the conflicts inherent in a culture where personal development is codified and commodified. She gets pretty fired up as she speaks to a great many who\u2019ve invested so much of themselves in the Org\u2019s training, challenging the idea that they need to stick around in order to make use of the best parts of what they\u0027ve learned. The episode wraps with a peek into what listeners are writing \u0026 sharing about the \u2018cult\u2019ure series.

      "description": "Due to unexpected weather patterns, Candice opens up the episode from her bedroom closet where she\u2019s riding out a monsoon thunderstorm. The metaphor is a timely one, as she speaks candidly about a humbling week that put her face to face with her number one challenge \u2014 speaking hard truths \u0026 disappointing people. This leads directly into the third and final segment of the conversation she had with Tracy Stamper back in March of this year. In part 3, Tracy wraps up her personal story of exiting the Org. She speaks about the shame she felt after speaking out back in 2018, and how difficult it was to re-orient herself to a world outside of the practice. Candice shares more of what she has learned while doing research into cult dynamics, specifically the role language plays in groupthink ideology and how thought-terminating cliches can sometimes keep us from taking restorative action. She \u0026 Tracy discuss how cult fitness \u2018costumes\u2019 communicate credibility and allegiance, and how awkward it can feel to step outside of group norms. Tracy has an ah-hah moment when Candice shares the three reasons she thinks she was/is susceptible to high-demand influences, and then the episode wraps with a reality check around the new age \u2018cult\u2019ure of idealism.

      "description": "In the fourth episode of the \u0027cult\u0027ure series, Candice is back with Part 2 of her conversation with Tracy Stamper. In a follow-up to last week, Tracy shares candidly about the devastation she felt in 2017 when she was fired from the high-demand \u0027cult\u0027ure where she\u0027d devoted sixteen years of her life. She was let go within hours of her father\u0027s passing, and the loss - of a parent, a job, an identity, and a community - resulted in feelings of grief and overwhelm. Tracy shares about the months-long struggle she experienced as she fought to reorient herself to the outside world without revealing the Org family secrets... that is until chronic physical pain prompted her to speak out via Facebook. Candice describes what it was like to witness the shitstorm that resulted [cue the flying monkeys!] and why it is she chose to reach out to Tracy in the midst of the social media frenzy. Tracy shares what it was like to receive the unexpected support, and the two discuss how it felt to compare notes after over a decade of silence. Toward the end of the episode, Candice gets personal, sharing why their reconnection was so damn timely and how it clued her into her own family-of-origin cult dynamic. The episode wraps with Tracy describing why, despite how things went down last time, she decided to push through her fear \u0026 share the full story of her experience on this podcast.

Tracy will be joining Candice for a series of episodes where the two reflect on what it\u2019s like to survive the aftermath of a culty culture. In part one of their convo, you\u2019ll hear about how they met one another and individually progressed through various levels of high-demand training - both of them \u2018dancing on eggshells\u2019 on opposite sides of the country. Tracy bravely shares about her own experiences working in the inner circle, sharing stories about the mixed messages she received and how disorienting it was to perpetually reframe chronic anxiety as \u2018an exercise in personal power.\u2019 She talks about why she felt sadness and betrayal when Candice left and started leading classes in another modality (no longer barefoot, wtaf?!), and Candice shares about the time she re-entered the practice and felt like the only sober person in the room. Tracy speaks about the addictive nature of the group awareness training environment and offers an intimate peek inside of the highest level of training, sharing about an exercise that leads the two into a fascinating discussion about agency and bounded choice. And the episode wraps with the red flag that helped Tracy to realize that stepping away from the practice wasn\u2019t going to be as simple as it seemed.

In this episode, Candice speaks transparently about the decade she spent working and teaching in new-age wellness circles. She tells you how she extricated herself from a pseudoscientific yoga cult in 2002, and what it might\u2019ve cost her had she stayed. She speaks transparently about the three years she spent working in the inner circle of an international mind-body fitness organization, and how she struggled mightily to leave despite growing physical discomfort and nonstop interpersonal dysfunction. An addiction to idealism \u0026 new age prosperity gospel only exacerbated her feelings of self-doubt and stuckness (because gaslighting is real, y\u0027all). Toward the end of the episode, she describes the life-changing moment when the spiritual scaffolding she\u0027d built her self-worth around finally came crashing to the ground and shares how it led to the most destructive relationship of her life. In between stories, Candice borrows wisdom from cult experts, sharing about about the mechanics of \u0027culty\u0027 cultures and how \u0026 why we get so damned enmeshed. You\u0027ll learn about love bombing, milieu control, and moral injury; then the episode wraps with a critique of commercialized wellness and the problems inherent in a capitalist \u0027cult\u0027ure - where mental health and meaning are branded, packaged, and sold. It\u0027s jam-packed with cautionary tales \u0026 educational content that will help you make meaning out of the relational messes in your life.

      "description": "In the first episode of the \u0027cult\u0027ure series, Candice invites us to get real about the relationships and groups we occupy. What does it mean to be psychosocially \u2018under the influence\u2019 and why are we humans so prone to surrendering personal agency? Candice shares more about what\u0027s challenged her most when it comes to living at the center of her own story, revealing the recent therapeutic ah-hah that led to the creation of this podcast summer series. Spiritual wounds are defined, as well as the Buddhist concept of near enemies and what they have to teach us about abuse of power, specifically in group wellness circles. She challenges the thought-terminating cliche \u0027there are no victims\u0027 and speaks openly about the dangers of idealistic generalizations arguing that often the suppression of pain is far more oppressive than laying claim to victimhood. We unpack the 4-letter word \u0027cult,\u0027 embracing its nuance with an acknowledgment that the dynamics of social control can be both subtle or severe and that, in either instance, they have a measurable impact on human agency. Ernest Becker\u0027s work helps us to understand why it is do-gooders are so often the ones making such a goddamned mess of things, and Candice unpacks \u2018bounded choice\u2019 - the psychological mechanics of staying put - why it is we stick around even when we shouldn\u0027t. The episode wraps with a sneak-peek into the \u0027cult\u0027ure series gameplan moving forward.

      "description": "Candice is wrapping up the spring season with a special guest and dear friend, Kim Dawson. Kim candidly shares her personal story and the pivotal moment when her dream of becoming a prima ballerina were shattered due to an \u2018emotional injury\u2019 that would linger for decades. She talks about what it was like working in Silicon Valley back in the 80s when blatant misogyny went unchecked and how resentment around her early-life successes eventually led her to make self-sabotaging choices in her professional life. Candice shares how she \u0026 Kim met, and they speak honestly about what it was like to work for a personal growth organization where self-sacrifice and codependency were the norms. Candice tells you about the teaching colleague who woke her ass up by setting an example of sovereignty that rocked her world wide-open and why. Kim gives you a taste of her work, leading Candice in an exercise that demonstrates how often what we see in others is what we most need to recognize within ourselves. Sovereignty is defined and discussed, as well as how the shift from \u0027freedom-from\u0027 to \u0027freedom-with\u0027 can help us to reinvent our relationship to the world around us. The episode wraps with a very intimate moment when Kim shares about the recent passing of her mother and how she is re-authoring her life anew. Kimberly Dawson is the founder of REVOLUTION Business \u0026 Life Design. She co-conspires with creative purpose seekers and changemakers to bring their love to business and life. Kim was a strategic innovator in marketing, sales and operations roles with ground-breaking businesses and organizations primarily in the Silicon Valley and Europe. She invested in her own transformative life journey and saw an opportunity to shift from empowering companies and organizations to engaging deeply with individuals. Kimberly earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in communication design with a minor in art and business from Chico State University (summa cum laude). Kimberly\u2019s work has become a powerful platform for designing innovative businesses, co-operating in healthy relationships, and helping people lead lives they most desire. revolutionbizdesign.com | IG: @thepointofyou Support the show The stories and opinions shared in this episode are based on personal experience and are not intended to malign any individual, group, or organization.

Since then, the Honey Mama\u0027s brand has become a staple at health food stores all across the country. Christy shares how close friendship and a shared desire for better health inspired her to develop this genius superfood sweet treat, and how it all started with a monthly booth at the local farmer\u2019s market.

      "description": "Grief has a lot in common with gravity; it\u0027s an unavoidable force of life that can knock us to our knees in an instant. Monica Welty knows all about that. In 2013, she tragically lost her newborn son, Harvey; this episode releases on what would\u0027ve been his ninth birthday. Since then, Monica has been bravely sharing her story and providing others a space to be witnessed in their own experiences of loss. In this episode, she explains why she chooses to grieve such an intimate loss with public transparency and talks about why there are some losses we never fully recover from. Candice \u0026 Monica discuss how grief paradoxically requires we come to terms with deep existential truths while also finding ways to reconnect to everyday aliveness. They wonder at the way we \u2018do math\u2019 in order to make meaning out of our losses, and how \u0026 when this is helpful. Monica gets uber-honest about the shameful thoughts she had just following the loss of her son, and Candice shares how her current spiritual practice is all about believing in nothing and learning to relax into the mystery of life. The episode wraps with an unscripted moment where Candice shares a story of loss that she\u2019s never before shared publicly. Monica Welty dedicates herself to helping people feel better. After studying psychology and human development in college, she now works in Portland, OR as a massage therapist and health coach. She writes about the complex experience of grief and loss after the death of her son in 2013 in the hopes that, from her honest expression, others will feel less alone. She is mom to Harvey, who would be 9, and his sister and step-sister, both 12. You can read her unedited blog at www.HarveyTheHero.com, hear more of her story on The Risk!

      "description": "Candice welcomes truth-teller and gifted encaustic artist, Kelly Williams, to the podcast. Kelly shares how a unique and challenging childhood shaped her reliance on self-expression as a means of survival and how, many years later, she discovered painting as an outlet for deep healing and personal transformation. She describes the fascinating, natural mediums through which she works, and how the process of painting offers a therapeutic avenue for the expression of the unspeakable. Kelly now guides students to reveal their secret selves safely, without the risk of unhealthy emotional over-exposure, explaining how art is an object lesson, revealing its maker, and how making a mess (or not) can become a valuable tool for self-awareness and/or social commentary. She and Candice discuss the difference between healthy exposure and performative vulnerability. Candice shares a personal discovery - how trying to be of service to others inadvertently gets in the way of being helpful - and together, they get real about things like imposter syndrome, survivor guilt, and sustaining creative integrity while operating in an online marketplace. Kelly Williams is a contemporary multi-media artist, painting primarily with encaustic, oils, and acrylics. Her large-scale encaustic abstracts are deeply layered, energetic, and textured expressions of internal emotional mapping. Her figurative work explores the more subtle dichotomy of narrative identity, sensuality, and expression. With a background in psychology and social work, Kelly found art to be a powerful tool in helping facilitate communication around that which is unspeakable. Her approach is an extension of the visual narrative as a method of psychological processing. As a full-time artist, she incorporates similar methods in her own process as well as working with individuals and small groups in a studio setting. Kelly continues to educate and mentor both amateur and professional artists, blending multiple methods and materials with a narrative psychology approach to inform her personal work, group workshops, and private sessions. kellywilliamsart.com | IG: @kellywilliamsart Support the show The stories and opinions shared in this episode are based on personal experience and are not intended to malign any individual, group, or organization.

      "description": "Join Candice for an inspiring dialogue with a long-time friend and coaching client, Karima Borni. Together, they take a philosophical deep dive into self-trust, specifically as it relates to life\u0027s dark directives. Kari shares how passage into motherhood triggered a \u0027primal\u0027 response in her body and mind, forcing her to re-author her entire approach to life. They reflect on the ongoing struggle to restore inner authority and embody the soul-self as our center of gravity; naming specific challenges that result when hard-earned identities are threatened by the passing seasons of life. Candice tells the story of a recent job offer, her ambivalence, and how she\u0027s learned to discern between fear and intuition. Kari speaks to how she\u2019s been able to trace so much of her suffering back to social conditioning and fears around mortality, and how she\u2019s now learning to approach life with greater equanimity and acceptance. This is a soulful dialogue that circles us back to the earliest episodes of the podcast, reminding us that no matter how much we seek to control life, it\u0027s gonna do its thing and continually remind us... trust is an inside job. Karima Borni is a college dance professor, dancer-choreographer, and scholar in human-animal studies. Her current research is on the development of somatic knowledge through interspecies communication. She holds a Ph.D. in cultural anthropology from Northwestern University.

      "description": "Candice sits down with naturopathic physician, Samantha LeVine to discuss individualized care, particularly as it pertains to women\u2019s health. Dr. Sam tells us about the moment when, at age seven, she realized she would become a doctor specializing in women\u2019s health. She describes naturopathic medicine, what differentiates it from a conventional practice, and how regulations vary from state to state. Candice shares how Dr. Sam\u2019s approach was a real game-changer for her own personal journey of health and self-care. She shares about the mysterious stroke-like symptoms she experienced in her twenties and early thirties, and how most medical professionals she encountered failed to take her mental health into account when suggesting diagnosis and treatment. The two discuss other examples of how emotional landscapes can impact physical health, and Dr. Sam emphasizes how essential it is to be physiologically informed when it comes to emotional challenges. Dr. Sam offers a fascinating explanation of how sugar, both positively and negatively, impacts the brain and whether or not there is a difference between medicine and medication. The episode wraps up with some very practical guidance regarding peri-menopausal and post-menopausal considerations. Dr. Sam tells us how to better prepare the body for this \u0027change of life\u0027 using proper testing and then talks candidly about whether or not hormone replacement therapy is a good idea.

      "description": "In a very special episode, and in honor of Transgender Day of Visibility, Candice sits down with her dear friend, Rachel Kaufman. Rachel speaks about how the pandemic impacted her work as a massage therapist and reflects on what it\u2019s like to live as a trans woman during this time of unprecedented political backlash. She generously shares about why she decided to come out as a trans woman, and the many challenges she has faced along the way. She tells us how therapy and a strong support network carried her through her journey of transitioning and speaks to why, as a binary trans woman, she personally yearns to be received plain and simply as a woman, without all the awkwardness and adjectives. Candice digs into why it is we so often inaccurately conflate cognitive dissonance with safety concerns, and the two discuss healthy alternatives to transphobic projections. They explore how misogyny and internalized homophobia so often lead to violence and pathological enforcement of gender norms, and how legislation (even the bills that fail to pass) are actively endangering LGBTQ\u0026#43; individuals as we speak. Rachel shares tangible examples of how cis gender folks often do harm by treating trans people differently, and she offers some practical tips for self-awareness in an effort to help cis folks up-level their support - from hollow promises of allyship toward meaningful action. . Rachel Kaufman is a neurodivergent transgender woman. She was born and raised in the metro area of Portland, OR and currently resides there with her two sweet puppies and bajillion plant babies. As a queer, polyamorous, sex positive and staunchly feminist person, she holds little space for ideals that seek to dehumanize, alienate, invalidate or otherwise harm the people of her community and beyond. She has been a practicing massage therapist since 2011 and owns Thrive Therapeutic Massage in Oregon City, OR. She is passionate about providing a safe, accepting, healing space for all people, all identities, and all bodies.

      "description": "What on earth does pruning plants have to do with self-care? More than you might expect. Candice talks with \u2018plant nerd\u2019 and pruning coach, Monica Maggio, about her experience working as a plant care specialist. Monica explains how consciously carrying for perennial plants fosters self-awareness, empathy, and accountability. Monica gets personal, sharing a watershed moment in high school that inspired her to pursue environmental studies and horticulture. Now, after over a decade of working intimately with clients and their plants, she has uncovered a fascinating overlap between pruning methodologies and how we care for ourselves. Candice is all-in on this topic, admitting how her own \u0027stuff\u0027 has long been reflected in how she goes about pruning her rose bushes. The two discuss what plants have to teach us about trauma and resilience, and Monica walks us through a handful of helpful pruning techniques. Together, they marvel at how each approach provides a useful metaphor for self-development and our place in the natural order of things. Monica continually invites us to turn our attention toward indigenous cultures who have long embodied an interdependent relationship with nature. She references Robin Wall Kimmerer, author of Braiding Sweetgrass, who writes: \u0022Action on behalf of life transforms. Because the relationship between self and the world is reciprocal... as we work to heal the earth, the earth heals us.\u201D Monica Maggio is a fruit growing expert and pruning coach based in Portland, OR. Monica believes good pruning combines science, art, nature, and nurture in powerful ways that help plants (and the people that care for them) thrive.

The two discuss how a moment of shared transparency in their bi-monthly book club sparked an ongoing conversation around resentment and feelings of invisibility. Katherine shares her story of growing up on a farm and how conventional gender roles shaped her choices as a wife and mother. She speaks openly about 44 years of marriage, and about how life as a stay-at-home mom often resulted in feelings of invisibility and a yearning for something more. After her children left home, Katherine\u0027s identity shifted as she began reclaiming her inner authority and revising her approach to life. She shares how this new way of being has impacted her personal relationships and her approach to self-expression; and she explains how, now that she has learned to embrace \u0027invisibility\u0027, she feels more clearly seen than ever before. Candice shares how she has been navigating her own mixed feelings when it comes to visibility.

      "description": "In the first episode of a two-part series, Candice sits down with long-time colleague and friend, Erika Ruber. Erika is a psychotherapist, movement facilitator, and trauma-informed educator. Together, they speak openly about the collective mental health challenges we now face, and Erika shares about the group and individual support she has been able to offer her clients throughout the pandemic. She speaks to the practical importance of movement and self-regulation, offering examples of how we can validate ourselves when we are faced with social isolation, existential dilemmas, and/or emotional triggers. Together they explore the subtle-yet-profound difference between \u2018being seen\u2019 and being visible in a world of social currency. As a breast cancer survivor, Erika shares about an intimate healing experience she had in Maui, and invites us to re-orient our selves toward embodied self-compassion as a practice. Candice opens up about how somatic therapy was a turning point in her own healing journey and how the power of emotional intelligence has been key to her mental health and healing. The episode wraps up with an example of a triggering moment in Erika\u0027s life and how she used the tools of mindfulness to re-orient and practice self-empathy; her story serves as the foundation for Part 2, which will feature a layman\u2019s deep-dive into the nervous system and self-regulation. Erika Ruber offers a unique, integrative approach to health and wellness, combining her education in Clinical Social Work with extensive training in movement, dance, and mindfulness. As a psychotherapist, Erika combines a focus on integrating traditional talk therapy with whole body awareness, achieving effective results in helping people to recover, heal, and strengthen themselves and their relationships. As the founder of Emerge Movement, Erika combines mental health with movement, allowing participants to explore what emerges in body, mind, and emotion. Erika worked for years as an individual and group therapist at Morrison Child \u0026 Family Services Family Sexual Abuse Treatment Program. She has received training and certification in Sensorimotor psychotherapy, a body centered approach to trauma treatment. She has developed and implemented a Body Mind wellness curriculum for middle schools and co-created the Mindful Parent and Caregiver Program with Mark Lilly, Founder of Street Yoga. This curriculum teaches everyday skills using movement, yoga, and mindfulness to decrease stress, increase self care, and live more powerfully as a parent and or clinician/social worker. Erika is happily married with two teenage kids in Portland, OR. She loves being out in nature skiing, hiking, biking, paddling, and playing every chance she gets.

      "description": "Candice sits down with grad-school friend, nonprofit director, and addictions specialist, Niles Comer. Niles shares his personal story of trauma and loss, and opens up about his lifelong journey of addiction recovery. He describes how he has learned to \u0027live from his scars rather than his wounds\u2019 and shares why transparency is so critical to sobriety. Niles shares the statistical realities of addiction rates in a post-pandemic world; then together, they discuss the essential, and often complex, interplay between inner authority and community, agreeing that they are equally essential to the path of healing. Candice unpacks how her early years of personal empowerment crossed over into spiritual bypassing, and how she learned (often the hard way) the fundamental difference between positive psychology and toxic positivity. Niles chimes in as they discuss how the industries of self-help and wellness very often leave people feeling less equipped and more isolated than ever. This episode contains some intimate shares [trigger warning for abuse survivors] and also lots and lots of shared laughter. It\u0027s a full-spectrum experience \u0026 a must-hear for anyone who is striving to embrace the fullness (and messiness) of their humanity. Niles Comer has spent his life working for and alongside those at the margins of society \u2013 the addicted, the homeless, the disenfranchised. His professional experiences include CEO, nonprofit director, addictions counselor, HIV/AIDS case manager, recovery center manager, trainer/educator, community development specialist, and social entrepreneur. Niles has over 30 years of personal and professional experience with addiction and recovery, mental health, trauma, homelessness, spiritual development, community renewal, and the impacts of poverty. He is currently the Director of Roanoke Valley Collective Response, a regional collaborative of 200 agencies responding to the ongoing rise of addiction rates in Southwestern Virginia whose mission is \u201Cto build, sustain, and support communities by responding to addiction and promoting recovery and wellness.\u201D Support the show The stories and opinions shared in this episode are based on personal experience and are not intended to malign any individual, group, or organization.

      "description": "Candice \u0026 Sylvia pick up where they left off last week, reflecting on what twenty years of friendship has taught them about love, especially during hard times. Inspired by the wisdom of bell hooks, they explore an expansive definition of love, and Sylvia speaks about where her capacity to offer compassionate support may have originated. She speaks transparently, and somewhat tearfully, about how the knowledge that we are loved can carry us through life\u0027s darkest moments. Together, Sylvia and Candice get fired up about how love is often \u0027sold\u0027 to us as a commodity and the pressures to produce/perform in a capitalist society. And the episode wraps up with a conversation on menopause filled with all sorts of hilarity and laughter.

In Episode 18, she introduces you to her closest friend and confidant, Sylvia Bueno, for a two-part series where they dive into the joys \u0026 pains of friendship, transparency, and wholehearted connection. In Part 1, Sylvia makes room as Candice unpacks an honest \u0026 ass-kicking ah-hah that inspired her to re-imagine the format of the TDP podcast moving forward. Sylvia recaps the courageous feedback she offered Candice about her experience as a friend and listener, and the two talk about how it landed in light of Candice\u0027s struggle with Imposter Syndrome. Candice details how she was able to complete the project (and minimize vulnerability) while recording the first seventeen episodes, and she offers a peek into what she calls \u0027high talk\u2019 and her theory into how\u0026why so many personal growth purveyors so often use it to armor up and guard against emotional exposure. Together, they explore the cost of high talk when it comes to preserving authenticity and forging deep connection. If you share Candice\u0027s pesky habit of filtering out the grittier parts of your humanity (aka: if you\u0027re used to putting on a \u0027good\u0027 face), this episode just might speak directly to your heart.

In the final episode of the long-running series, we get more practical than ever. Candice has spent nearly two decades consumed by a curiosity: Why is it that some people are so capable of creating meaningful change (aka: movement) in their lives, while others continually struggle to find traction? It was at least in part, her desire to find an answer to this question that led her to pursue a Master\u0027s degree in Social Impact. Now fresh out of grad school, she shares some potent takeaways from her postgraduate research on human agency and social change - weaving together personal stories, data, and scholarly research to help you identify some of the barriers that might be standing between YOU and the changes you seek to make in your own life and in the world at large. This episode is recommended for anyone experiencing feelings of stuckness \u0026/or for those who hope to re-imagine a more pluralistic society; one that prioritizes equity and universal access to the internal and external tools necessary to create meaningful change.

In Part 1 of a two-part series on agency, we\u0027re going to explore what keeps us moving in life and why it is we get stuck. Candice reviews the first six keys. Then she walks you through the five facets of human agency and explains how a deficit in any one of these areas can erode agency over time. We explore why choice is so damn complicated and how motivation is rarely as simple as finding the energy to do the thing. As usual, honest stories bring the content to life. Candice shares how insecurity led to a perpetual loss of agency in her life \u0026 how she eventually found the will to move as an independent entity. This episode is a great place to start if you\u0027re feeling stuck or unsure of your next move.

We illuminate the paradox at the heart of the symbolic self - the fear of being seen and the fear of going unnoticed. What does it take to rise above self-consciousness? True belonging... only thing is, the definition might surprise you. When we think of social movements, we most often envision massive political uprisings, collective fists raised an allegiance to a cause and fired up organizers with megaphones speaking truth to power. And yet, collective politics is shaped by intrapsychic forces, by how we each internalize and translate our experience of the world through our own unique lens. Candice invites you into a more holistic expression of purpose, using personal stories to illustrate the difference between job, duty, and calling. Rising consciousness (aka \u2018wokeness\u2019) is both a personal and social endeavor that raises collective consciousness through perpetual curiosity, applied self-awareness, and shared accountability.

In this episode, we explore integrity as an internal compass and pluralistic embodiment of connection. When we are willing to step outside of our personal identities, we mature emotionally and grow into trans-rational understanding - a worldview that is connective and universally accepting. Candice shares more personal stories, sharing about some times in her life when stepping into integrity meant risking security and belonging in favor of the gravitas within. This episode will help you reconnect with grittiness, grace, and your very own center of gravity. Explore how to better navigate dissonance and find the answer to the question: Is this a growth edge or a story I can no longer fit inside? Change is humbling and shedding identities can feel wildly unsettling, especially when you choose to express wholeness rather than play a part in a divisive norm. In the end, there is no greater service to the whole of life than an integral way of being. Integrity is an active acceptance that enables you to love (and live) more freely.

What if you can cultivate a capacity within you that offers an alternative to cutting ties and erecting walls? What if it\u0027s possible to go beyond boundaries? In part 1 of the two-part sovereignty series, we explore what it looks like to swap self-protection for embodied self-regard. We get real about anger, conventional gender roles, and what it means to know the sovereign self whose expression doesn\u2019t rely (so much) on external validation.

She offers a variety of personal stories to illustrate, revealing shameful mistakes she\u2019s made along the way, moments when she failed to offer what was needed in the face of shared vulnerability. You\u2019ll learn about three different types of empathy, and how \u2018emotional intelligence\u2019 is a developmental journey that has everything to do with where (and how) our inner and outer worlds continually intersect.

Using personal stories from her own life, she paints a vivid picture of how generational trauma gets passed down through generations; inviting us to soften in our approach so that we might approach vulnerability in ways that are more compassionate and inclusive.

She offers a peek into her two decade struggle with a panic disorder and how, to her eventual and bittersweet relief, it forced her to befriend her fear and forge an alliance with anxiety. Humility, as an expressive force, isn\u0027t about meekness or needs subjugation. On the contrary, it is the ability to show up fully - to lean into life as it is and embrace the dark directives that shake us to wake us.
