      "description": "This documentary, exclusive to YouTube, explores the sinister coercion and control that led to the coldhearted killing of showjumper Katie Simpson. \n\nNicola Tallant and the Crime World team talk to journalists and investigators, as well as Katie\u0027s friends and Creswell\u0027s victims, to investigate just how domestic abuser Jonathan Creswell was allowed to hurt so many people, and why he almost got away with murder.\n\n21-year-old showjumper Katie Simpson\u2019s death was initially staged as a suicide but later revealed to be rape and murder at the hands of Jonathan Creswell, a 36-year-old with a history of controlling and abusing women. \n\nBased on the podcast series Groomed this narrative plunges into the dark world of a charismatic yet deeply depraved horseman who cultivated a cult-like control over multiple women, including Katie, her sister Christina, Jill Robinson, Hayley Robb, and Rose De Montmorency Wright. Despite a history of violence, chillingly previewed by the abuse of a former partner, Olympic showjumper Abigail Lyle, Creswell remained untouchable within the privileged equestrian community. \n\nIt took the relentless efforts of a determined journalist and others to expose the truth, even as Creswell\u2019s own dramatic suicide during his murder trial left his accomplices to face justice alone. \n\nFollow us\n- TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@crimeworldnicolatallant \n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/CrimeNicola\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/crimeworldwithnicolatallant\n\nListen\n- Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/ie/podcast/crime-world/id1540069464\n- Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/65o6FlP05o1ukHWUejIHlR?si=htTJFag4Q_ausqX8kNntEg\u0026nd=1",

In the Crime World Presents podcast series Groomed she describes how she tried to raise red flags with police after killer Jonathan Creswell told them that Katie had taken her own life. In Nicola\u0027s book Groomed she documents the lengths Tanya went to - to agitate the police and to have them held to account. Tanya continues to seek the truth in the case despite Creswell\u2019s death. Nicola speaks with Tanya Fowles about how she is still pushing for answers five years after Katie\u2019s tragic death.
