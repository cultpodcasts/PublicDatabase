And to my surprise we had the same idea on what that story was. it was the story of Dinah and Victim Blaming. I hope you take a few minutes to watch, I will warn you there is a good bit of talk and detail about my CSA experience, so please proceed with caution if you are sensitive to this subject! \n\nAs always, remember to Be Yourself and Be Well!!! \uD83D\uDC97\uD83D\uDE09",

With the recent changes to organizational policy adding frustration and pressure to some in and some who have left the JWs, some have turned to unhealthy ways to cope.  There are healthier means, though, to dealing with these pressures.\n\nUnlike what is being offered by the Governing Body for addiction support and recovery, the World actually offers helpful and scientifically proven methods to treat and overcome addiction.\n\nDo you need help with addiction right now?  Here are some groups that can help regardless of what you believe or don\u0027t believe.\n\nhttps://smartrecovery.org/ - SMART Recovery is the leading, evidence-informed approach to overcoming addictive behaviors and leading a balanced life. SMART is stigma-free and emphasizes self-empowerment.\n\nhttps://www.aa.org/ - 12 step recovery program with an emphasis on a Higher Power.\n\nhttps://na.org/ - 12 step recovery program with an emphasis on a Higher Power.\n\nhttps://www.worldwidesecularmeetings.com/ - 12 step recovery program with an emphasis on a Higher Power, geared toward agnostics and atheists.\n\nhttps://thesatanictemple.com/pages/sober-faction  - The Satanic Temple Sober Faction provides peer support recovery for addiction free from the pseudoscience and superstitious dogma entrenched in most mainstream programs.\n\nThough I am not an addiction treatment professional, if you need someone to talk to, I can be reached via email at justjune1973@gmail.com\n\nAs always, be yourself, and be well.",

It\u0027s about why I was not making videos for the last year and my struggle with alcoholism, self worth and the pressure of having new found freedom from Watchtower and not knowing how to handle it after 45 years in the high control religion. I hope you stay tuned for the longer, more in depth video coming soon and subsequent videos thereafter. And remember, Be yourself and Be well! \u263A\uFE0F\uD83D\uDC97",
