There are healthier means, though, to dealing with these pressures.\n\nUnlike what is being offered by the Governing Body for addiction support and recovery, the World actually offers helpful and scientifically proven methods to treat and overcome addiction.\n\nDo you need help with addiction right now?  Here are some groups that can help regardless of what you believe or don\u0027t believe.\n\nhttps://smartrecovery.org/ - SMART Recovery is the leading, evidence-informed approach to overcoming addictive behaviors and leading a balanced life. SMART is stigma-free and emphasizes self-empowerment.\n\nhttps://www.aa.org/ - 12 step recovery program with an emphasis on a Higher Power.\n\nhttps://na.org/ - 12 step recovery program with an emphasis on a Higher Power.\n\nhttps://www.worldwidesecularmeetings.com/ - 12 step recovery program with an emphasis on a Higher Power, geared toward agnostics and atheists.\n\nhttps://thesatanictemple.com/pages/sober-faction  - The Satanic Temple Sober Faction provides peer support recovery for addiction free from the pseudoscience and superstitious dogma entrenched in most mainstream programs.\n\nThough I am not an addiction treatment professional, if you need someone to talk to, I can be reached via email at justjune1973@gmail.com\n\nAs always, be yourself, and be well.",
