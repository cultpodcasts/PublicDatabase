      "description": "Your journey to more success:\nhttps://garycoxe.com/\n\nBeing part of a cult is challenging enough\u2014but leaving one? That can be even harder.\n\nIn this video, I share my personal story of being born and raised in a cult, the extreme steps I had to take to protect my sanity, and how I fought to stay alive after leaving.\n\nThis was, without a doubt, the most difficult experience of my life\u2014and I\u2019ve been through my fair share of tragedy.\n\nTo my JW viewers who aren\u2019t \u201Csupposed\u201D to watch this (thanks to the programming that paints me as a villain, I\u0027m so okay with it lol), I look forward to reading your comments.\n\nFor anyone trying to leave, considering it, or who has already left\u2014know you\u2019re not alone. If you need support, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out, especially on Instagram.\n\nEnjoy the video, and I\u2019m excited to hear your thoughts in the comments. \uD83D\uDCAC",
