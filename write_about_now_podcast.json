      "description": "Many of us have encountered a narcissist\u2014at work, in life, or in our own families. But many of us are not prepared to deal with the traumatic psychological and destructive toll narcissists can cause. Guest Dan Shaw is a social worker, psychoanalyst, and the author of an illuminating new book called Traumatic Narcissism: Relational Systems of Subjugation. He talks about how his own experience in a cult with a charismatic leader led him to pursue a psychology career. Then he sheds light on narcissistic personality disorder, sharing suggestions on how to reprogram those who have been adversely affected.",
