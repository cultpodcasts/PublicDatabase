      "description": "What a treat to start our season 2 with A Little Bit Culty podcast hosts (and NXIVM cult survivors) Sarah Edmonson and Nippy Ames! Sarah Edmondson is a Canadian actress who has starred in the CBS series Salvation and more than twelve films for the Hallmark Channel and Lifetime. She is also a well-established voice-over artist for popular series such as Transformers: Cybertron and My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic. In 2005, when NXIVM, a personal and professional development company, promised to provide the tools and insight Sarah needed to reach her potential, she was intrigued. Over her twelve-year tenure, she went from student to coach and eventually operated her own NXIVM center in Vancouver. Questions kept coming up about the organization\u2019s rules and practices, which came to a head in 2017 when she accepted an invitation from her best friend to join DOS, a \u201Csecret sisterhood\u201D within NXIVM. In 2019, Sarah published Scarred: The True Story of How I Escaped NXIVM, the Cult that Bound My Life, with Kristine Gasbarre. In this tell-all memoir, she shares her story from the moment she takes her first seminar to her harrowing fight to get out. Her full story as a whistleblower is featured in the CBC podcast Uncover: Escaping NXIVM \u00A0(downloaded over 25 million times) and The Vow, the critically acclaimed HBO documentary series on NXIVM. Now with the launch of \u201CA Little Bit Culty,\u201D Sarah and her co-host/husband Anthony \u201CNippy\u201D Ames are keeping the conversation going by discussing the healing process with the help of experts and fellow survivors. As an aspiring actor and former college athlete, Anthony \u201CNippy\u201D Ames was drawn to NXIVM\u2019s goals program. In his 12 years with the organization, he rose steadily up the ranks as a teacher, built centers in New York and Vancouver, and even met his now wife, \u201CA Little Bit Culty\u201D co-host Sarah Edmondson there. But when he learned that the company was, in fact, a dangerous cult, he wasted no time in doing exactly what needed to be done: helping burn its carefully constructed public image to the ground. With NXIVM\u2019s notorious founder now behind bars facing a brisk 120-year sentence, Nippy isn\u2019t planning on going quiet anytime soon. As Executive Producer of the \u201CA Little Bit Culty\u201D podcast, Nippy has come full circle back to what he was born to do: performing, creating, and truth telling. He\u2019s proving to be an emerging voice in the conversation around what it means to be an upstanding man, husband, and father in 2021.",

      "description": "Trigger Warning: this episode contains content about sex trafficking. Please take care of your needs regarding this topic or skip this episode if this topic is triggering for you.\u00A0\u00A0 Recruiting and grooming sexual partners, weeding out critics, using harassment and coercion, encouraging others to take expensive courses to further control them are all reasons that prosecutions have proceeded in court in other cases. Listen and hear how some real cases could potentially bring these crimes to justice. What laws are in place to protect women from abuse? \u00A0Listen and learn about what is actually sex trafficking and how it is happening when people put trust into a leader and an organization. It really makes you look at how people have been used and how the law can actually protect them. There are tools for survivors to use Civil Law for federal crimes. \u0022Masha\u0027s Law\u0022 is written into Title 18 where all the Federal crimes are located. It gives survivors the power to bring their own civil lawsuits against sex offenders who may have abused or exploited them, even if it wasn\u0027t reported and police did not arrest. The survivor can still go after that offender. It covers sex trafficking (a broad expansive federal crime meant to protect victims of exploitative abuse) includes \u0022enticement\u0022 either in person or online. It\u0027s very powerful but also under-used. More than forced prostitution, the federal definition qualifies: makes it illegal for someone to participate in a venture (2 or more people) that uses force, fraud or coercion to subject the victim to engage in a commercial sex act (defined as \u0022in exchange for anything of value\u0022 including but not limited to: a free training; moving up in the organization; benefit or status -- and does not have to be a direct contract) or if it\u0027s a minor, even if there is no force or coercion needed. Even \u0022demanding absolute commitment\u0022 to the leader, or inducing shame and guilt to control the members and their behavior.

There is no 8\u0022 Gino in my head\u0022 - Baron Baptiste  Does this sound like advanced-level facilitator training content to you? Well, believe it or not this (and more!) is what we learned in the first \u201CFacilitator In Training\u201D in 2014 (now known as Fit to Lead). 28 of us paid $10K each for the promise that we would be trained directly by Baron to be the successors of the \u201CBaptiste Legacy\u201D, able by the end of the 2-year, 8 weekend-long training, to lead Baptiste programs. We were nervous, excited but quickly learned we were about to get NOTHING we signed up for and could not have imagined how horribly abusive Baron would turn out to be.  All names except Baron Baptiste have been changed to preserve peoples\u2019 privacy and to keep the focus where it belongs - on Baron.  There are so many stories of public humiliation and abuse, including \u201CLiam\u201D \u00A0(international yoga teacher)shredded by Baron for (private) pot useage, getting help from his parents and his use of the term \u201Chotel motel, holiday inn\u201D to describe a yoga black. Baron required participation in 40 days because he thought we needed to lose weight; \u201CCEO\u201D had us create content for free that BY then turned around and SOLD to the general public. As part of our training\u2026 We PAID Baron to create content!!  A rich drunk participant was praised while a sincere grown man was berated to the point of tears\u2026 a person who could not speak English well was made to believe (by Baron) that they could potentially lead programs; speech about your most embarrassing moment; name change, bait-and-switch; addition of Tier 4, teacher at Yoga Journal (pay), creating the content; creating more programs for them to use and charge community members for the programs.\u201CColleen you\u2019re fucked\u201D. - Baron.

      "description": "Listen to our mind-blowing conversation with Dr. Lalich and we describe in detail the process of going through Baptiste training and her explanation of how it\u0027s deliberately designed to make us into \u0022perfect little followers\u0022 and pretty soon taking on the doctrine of the group as our own. We have learned to commit and not speak out so any red flags we see are put on a \u0022shelf\u0022 until one day the shelf breaks and we start to untangle and question everything. Classic techniques used since the 60\u0027s and 70\u0027s birth of the Large Group Awareness Trainings (LGAT) era have been re-purposed by Baron and Baptiste Yoga which are touted as \u0022self-help\u0022 are actually designed to cause self abuse and train the participant to abuse and gaslight themselves using the \u0022tools\u0022 learned in the trainings. Learn how to not \u0022cult-hop\u0022 from one high control group to another by recognizing the sign and techniques used by many different types of cult-like groups. Janja Lalich, Ph.D. is a researcher, author, and educator specializing in cults and extremist groups, with a particular focus on charismatic relationships, political and other social movements, ideology and social control, and issues of gender and sexuality. She has been a consultant to educational, mental health, business, media, and legal professionals, as well as having worked with current members, former members, and families of members of controversial groups. A former Fulbright scholar, Dr. Lalich is Professor Emerita of Sociology at California State University, Chico, where in 2007 she was awarded the Professional Achievement Honor. Also, Dr. Lalich is the founder and director of the Center for Research on Influence and Control. She received a B.A. with Honors from the University of Wisconsin, Madison. She has a Master\u2019s in Human Development and a Ph.D. in Human and Organizational Systems from Fielding Graduate University in Santa Barbara, California. Dr. Lalich has written and lectured extensively and is author, coauthor, or editor of numerous books, articles, and chapters. Her most recent book is Take Back Your Life: Recovering from Cults and Abusive Relationships (Bay Tree Publishing, 2006), a\u00A0fully-revised and expanded edition of her first book, Captive Hearts, Captive Minds, which has been the number-one book used by former cult members and their friends and families to better understand cult experiences and their consequences. Another of her recent publications is the critically acclaimed Bounded Choice: True Believers and Charismatic Cults (University of California Press, 2004),\u00A0based on her research on the Heaven\u2019s Gate cult, the group that committed collective suicide in 1997, and her own 10\u002B years\u2019 experience in a political cult, the San Francisco-based Democratic Workers Party. Most importantly,\u00A0this book puts forth Dr. Lalich\u2019s \u201Cbounded choice\u201D theory, which offers a new approach for understanding the dynamics of \u201Cself-sealed\u201D groups and the true-believer phenomenon.

      "description": "Threats of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and Cease and Desist letters from attorneys are designed to bully and silence would-be whistler blowers. Could that be why so many people are speaking underground about Baptiste Yoga and so many women have stories to share about Baron but are afraid to go public? Attorney and former Baptiste Yoga teacher Eva Sedgwick explains why these tactics are lame attempts to scare us into silence and why they cannot hold up in a court of law. Also, Eva tells her own story and experience with Baptiste Yoga, why she got out after being publicly defamed by Baron in front of hundreds of people and never looked back. Eva then breaks down the difference between defamation and speaking the truth or giving your opinion about a \u0022Public figure\u0022 which falls under freedom of speech and is what we do here in this podcast. For any women who have been seduced by Baron while a student or training participant, Eva offers resources for Pro Bono (free) attorneys who will represent women in a case where Baptiste Yoga finally has it\u0027s #metoo moment.\u00A0  About our special guest: Eva Sedgwick is an associate professor of business law in the Albers School of Business and Economics at Seattle University. She has been teaching and writing about business and technology and how they intersect with human rights and social justice for over 20 years. Her work is published in such journals as the Stanford Technology Law Review and the American Business Law Journal. Eva has been recognized frequently for her innovative teaching. Teaching is Eva\u2019s passion and vocation. At Seattle University she teaches undergraduates and graduate students in topics such as business law, negotiation skills and law and ethics in business analytics/Artificial Intelligence. Eva is also a yoga teacher. She received her original yoga alliance certification after completing levels 1 and 2 with the Baptiste Power Yoga Institute. In 2019 she stepped back into training and completed her 240 hours of trauma-informed yoga teacher training with Yogamour, a nonprofit yoga organization in Maryland whose mission it is to bring yoga and mindfulness practices as an adjunct therapy for communities in trauma. When she is visiting Maryland, Eva teaches power vinyasa classes at Yogamour\u2019s affiliated studio. She is a former yoga instructor in Seattle at BeLuminous Yoga and Shakti Vinyasa Yoga.\u00A0  NEW Baptiste policies just release this week and seem suspiciously in response to our podcast and the issues we have discussed....

      "description": "We thought that becoming a \u0022Certified Baptiste Teacher\u0022 and a \u0022Baptiste Affiliate Studio\u0022 owner actually meant something of value and we worked hard to achieve this status thinking it represented a higher level of skill and ability in our careers. We took it seriously and then paid a lot of money and spent a lot of time to get there! But as it turns out the \u0022Path of a Baptiste Certified Teacher\u0022 is paved with moving targets and dangling carrots. And standards that change depending on how much status you bring or how many recruits you enroll = $$$ in Baron\u0027s pocket. It\u0027s a \u0022Pay to Play\u0022 system where the goal posts move every few years (or whenever he changes his mind). One day you are paying over $10K to become a \u0022Tier One\u0022 certified teacher and the next day all the standards go away in favor of a Cross-fit model where it takes just one weekend to earn a \u0022Baptiste Certificate. But what does Baptiste Certification even mean when some people just had to be friends with the right people to earn their \u0022500-Hour\u0022 status? Certribut-ifully nothing! Affiliate studios who pay $3K per year to sport the Baptiste name on their website benefit by being allowed to be Facebook friends with other studio owners and being listed on the Baptiste website. Literally, that\u0027s all. A dwindling number of affiliated studios act as recruitment stations by enrolling students into \u002240 Days to Personal Revolution\u0022 where they learn their first thought-terminating cliches and how to start gaslighting themselves, then the studios benefit by getting a $ kick-back for each Level 1 recruit they generate. Would you like to join into this and become a Tier 3 Certified Influencer for the low low price of $100,000?! We can show you how and how much value you will actually (not) get for your investment.

Oh f*ck, did we join a yoga cult?! We thought it was an organization that was changing the world through yoga - because the yoga felt so amazing and that\u0027s what the \u0022methodology\u0022 was supposed to help us do. But the deeper we got in, the more indoctrinated we became. We\u0027ve learned a LOT since then about manipulation, coercion, abuse of power and undue influence.

      "description": "Debbie Williamson was called the \u0022CEO\u0022 in the early days of Baptiste Yoga and owned affiliate studios until she was forced out by Baron in 2011. She had trained with him and loved his style of yoga since her first \u0022Bootcamp\u0022 in 2003 and went on to open one of the first Baptiste Affiliate studios and become a \u0022Master Baptiste Teacher\u0022 as appointed by Baron. She worked as his right hand person during programs (then called bootcamps), conferences and at managing his studios in Boston during those years as was on call for him by phone every day many times a day even on Holidays. One day Baron decided she should not host other \u0022big name\u0022 yoga teachers at her studio, even though the other affiliates were. He bent his own rules until he found a way to force her out and then told the other Baptiste teachers and affiliates that she had quit and stolen his contact list. But wait, there\u0027s much, much more... As evidenced by Debbie\u0027s story, there has been a lot of \u0022odd\u0022 stuff happening in this organization for many years!  ***The views and opinions expressed on Journey Into Yoga Cults are just that: views and opinions; and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast or the hosts.

Did I even learn any yoga? \u0022If it felt bad, why did you stay? Why did you fall for it?\u0022 Why did we drink the kool-aid? Did you think you were going for one thing - to learn to teach yoga or to deepen your practice - \u00A0but you find yourself sharing deep personal trauma in a \u201Chot seat\u201D style questioning session that go on for hours draining your capacity to keep your critical thinking. Did you see red flags but were afraid to speak up because Baron singled out anyone who seemed to not participate and because you had no time to process by yourself or with others because you were too busy. Did you actually learn any yoga alignment, philosophy, ethics? What happened to you on Day 3 - \u201CBreakthrough Day\u201D as the staff calls it. Did you breakthrough or breakdown on that day, give in to Baron and the Methodology and accept and embrace it all? Does this sound familiar? The Recipe for Thought Reform: (from Combating Cult Mind Control by Steven Hassan) \u201CInduced dissociated states, trance-induction via repeated affirmations, extended meditation, lengthy denunciation sessions, renegade psychotherapy without a license, hot seat criticisms focusing on one individual, extensive self-awareness training sessions, trauma bonding, isolation from friends and family, sleep deprivation, food deprivation. Control of information going in and out of the group environment. Peer and leadership pressure, extensive indoctrination sessions\u2026\u201D Did it prey on your desire to good in the world and then give you a discount if you register for Level 2 by then end of the week... what happened to you? ***The views and opinions expressed on Journey Into Yoga Cults are just that: views and opinions; and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast or the hosts.

This is not so much our response, as our point of view on why they decided to resort to name-calling and doubling down. We talk about what indoctrination is and how it happens to GOOD people. It happened to us! Also, why this type of defensive response is a tell-tale sign that this might be a cult. There, we said it.

This list comes from here website if you want to learn more here: http://www.alexandrastein.com/warning-signs.html   The group/person has the Total and Only answer. Only they have the right line, will make the revolution, solve your problems, empower you, make you loved, rich, effective, holy, etc.  Attempts to isolate you from existing close relationships (friends/family) and the outside world  Extreme, immediate and/or inappropriate friendliness or attention.  Promises of perfection if only you adhere to their program   Your \u201Cgut-feeling\u201D tells you something is wrong. Trust this, and try to analyze it.   The group creates conditions of extreme stress, threat or fear (emotional and/or physical)   Not answering questions, or turning them back on the questioner.   Inappropriate personal boundaries   Loaded language: strange language or jargon you initially can\u2019t understand. Canned, repetitive phrases.   A hard sell for further commitment, programs or contact. If you resist, you\u2019re selfish, ungodly, \u201Cbourgeois\u201D, don\u2019t believe in yourself, etc.   Encouragement to cut ties with family or friends, unless you can recruit them.   Secrecy, inappropriate \u201Cconfidentiality\u201D.   Lack of privacy - constantly with group members, constantly busy with group activities.   Ends justifies the means. It\u2019s OK to lie to others in the name of the Cause, God, for success, etc.   Challenging your fundamental identity:\u00A0 Your strengths are criticized as your weaknesses.   Once you\u2019re in, heavy pressure to stay in.   Those who do leave are shunned. They become the enemy, or objects of pity.   No criticism allowed of the group or leader. The group/leader is always right.   Deception: what you thought you\u2019d get on joining or attending an activity turns out to be something else.

BUT however, there are some \u0022practices and techniques\u0022 in this organization that walks, talks and quacks in a very curious way and while claiming to be the pillar of Integrity itself. We had some gut feelings and red flags galore; we ignored them for years because of our strong commitment to \u0022Being a Yes\u0022 for transforming the WHOLE PLANET (!!!) through Baptiste Yoga. Can we save the very essence of what got us all here, what transformed our own lives for the better?
