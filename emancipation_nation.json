      "description": "Ever wonder why some victims of human trafficking struggle to escape their situation, even when help is available? Tune into our Emancipation Nation episode 201 and allow us to shed light on two fundamental barriers that often impede victims from receiving the assistance they desperately need: transportation and housing. In this episode we unravel the significance of these basic needs and how their inadequacy can hinder victims\u0027 journey towards healing and freedom.In this enlightening discussion, we navigate the different types of housing solutions for victims, ranging from temporary shelters to transitional housing, and how each serves a unique purpose in the survivor\u0027s journey. Dr. Williamson, drawing from Maslow\u0027s hierarchy of needs, underscores the impossibility of focusing on higher-level needs without first catering to the basic physiological ones. Join us as we delve into these pressing issues, and gain invaluable insights into how we, as advocates, can more effectively address these barriers and equip survivors with the resources they need to begin their journey towards healing and independence.",
