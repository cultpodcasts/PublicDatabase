To this day, close family members will not speak to her, as is decreed by JW practices. \n\nToday, Lydia helps others who are struggling with their lives after leaving the Witnesses. She chats to Talk Beliefs about her harrowing story with great candor and detail about a life now a world away.\n\n**This video originally appeared on Talk Beliefs in early 2017. This version has had an audio cleanup, plus images added to enhance Lydia\u0027s story. \n\nSpecial thanks to audio engineer Ian (aka \u0027looknowsee\u0027) for his cleanup of this audio: http://bit.ly/2wb2PFo\n\n00:47 What was it like growing up Jehovah\u0027s Witness? \n04:11 What was the most difficult thing about growing up witness?\n09:07 How has being \u0027disfellowshipped\u0027 affected you? \n19:25 Talk about the \u0027Two Witness Rule\u0027 \n21:36 What about those considering joining the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses? \n24:08 Do you have any advice for ex-JWs? \n\nSecrets from the Cult - An Ex-Jehovah\u0027s Witness Speaks Out\nhttps://goo.gl/SNRjPn\n\nJehovah\u0027s Witnesses \u0027Two Witness Rule\u0027 ~ Explained\nhttps://goo.gl/cFKxFm\n---------\nLinks for Lydia Segebrecht (Lydia Finch):\n\nFollow Lydia on Twitter! @Stick_Pins\n\nEx-JW and struggling?

Christian \u0027behavioral modification camps\u0027 exist to do one thing - take a child or teen who is not behaving in the Christian way, and fix them.  Most are taken there against their will, and many cannot leave even after their 18th birthday. \n\nMARSHA METZ is 43 years old and lives near Seattle, a survivor still haunted by her years in Escuela Caribe - a Christian reform camp in the Dominican Republic. From 16 to 19, she endured scrutiny and harsh punishments from employees meant to be caring houseparents and people of God.\n\nHere, Marsha speaks out with passion and great attention to detail about her time at the camp, and how it has affected her life since her return home.\n\nToday, she runs a support group for other survivors of Escuela Caribe. \n\n\nLINKS:\n\nTalk Beliefs Religious Boot Camps Video Playlist: http://bit.ly/2NTXdWx\n\n\nLINKS for Deirdre Sugiuchi:\nOfficial Site: https://deirdresugiuchi.com\nTwitter: @DJSugi \n\n\nORGANIZATIONS\n\nSIA - http://www.sia-now.org/\n\nPieces of Victory - http://piecesofvictory.com\n\n\nFACEBOOKS GROUPS\n\nSurvivors of New Horizons Youth Ministries http://bit.ly/2NQ9ivM\n\nNew Horizons Alumni Association FB http://bit.ly/2LW0YtX\n\n\nDOCUMENTARIES\n\nKidnapped for Christ (Documentary about Escuela Caribe): http://www.kidnappedforchrist.com/\n\n\nBOOKS\n\nJulia Scheeres (Author \u0027Jesus Land\u0027): http://www.juliascheeres.com\n\nShirley Jo Petersen (Author \u0027The Whisper\u0027): http://shirleyjopetersen.com/\n\nDeirdre Sugiuchi (Author \u0027Unreformed\u0027): https://deirdresugiuchi.com/\n\n\n\n\u00A9 Copyright 2018 by Talk Beliefs (Re-use allowed with permission)\n\n**********\n\nTALK BELIEFS: Exploring - and challenging - what and why we believe. \n\nFollow @talkbeliefs on Twitter! \nJoin the Talk Beliefs Facebook Group http://bit.ly/2fCRLLF \nJoin the Talk Beliefs Facebook Page: fb.me/talkbeliefs\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.co.uk/talkbeliefs/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/talkbeliefs/\n\nWould you like to help support Talk Beliefs or perhaps tell your own story in an interview?

His childhood in Malaysia in the 1960s, observing the casual racism of colonials, led to research into evolutionary psychology and human nature.\n\nLINKS FOR BARRY DESBOROUGH:\n\nTwitter: @BarryDesborough\n\nBlog: https://barryhisblog.blogspot.com\n\nEvidence for Evolution (Talk Beliefs Interview): http://bit.ly/2HMuyRo\n\n\n\u00A9 Copyright 2018 by Talk Beliefs (Re-use allowed with permission)\n\n**********\n\nTALK BELIEFS: Exploring - and challenging - what and why we believe. \n\nFollow @talkbeliefs on Twitter! \nJoin the Talk Beliefs Facebook Group http://bit.ly/2fCRLLF \nJoin the Talk Beliefs Facebook Page: fb.me/talkbeliefs\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.co.uk/talkbeliefs/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/talkbeliefs/\n\nChannel enquiries \u0026 direct messages: unchainedmind1@gmail.com\n\nWould you like to become a supporter of the Talk Beliefs YouTube channel?

Today, Jacky comes to the studio to give Mark and Neal an update on the Exclusive Brethren, their isolationist practices, and information for those within the sect who wish to leave.\n\nThe Exclusive Brethren (recently re-branded as the Plymouth Brethren) is a sect of Protestantism that practices \u0027exclusion from evil\u0027, that is, isolation from the world, even going as far as avoiding eating with non-brethren. \n\nMany who grow up in the sect are dissatisfied with this restrictive life and endeavor to leave, but family and doctrinal ties make leaving extremely difficult. There are often harsh punishments for those who do not tow the Brethren line...\n\n#exexclusivebrethren #cults #belief\n\n\n\nLINKS FOR THIS EPISODE:\n\nJacky Hart: My Escape from the Exclusive Brethren - A Talk \u0026 Presentation ~ Jacky Hart http://bit.ly/2toPW8l\n\nWikiPeebia - support website for anyone who is within the Exclusive Brethren and wishes to leave but is finding it difficult.

I also bump into author and journalist Laurie Penny, who confronts a man who believes that males are being treated unfairly by women. \n\nAnd not to forget the bellicose Bible Basher who says that we (the crowd) are crazy with sin, love chaos, and are dressed \u0027like cowards\u0027. \n\nI cant help but notice that the railings of red-blooded, testosterone-filled men against the encroachment of femininity into their worlds seems to be the theme of the day. \n\nJust another normal Sunday at Speakers Corner!\n\n\n[Filmed with the Removu K1 and edited on Filmora 8.5.1 editsuite.]\n\u00A9 Copyright 2018 by Talk Beliefs (Re-use allowed with permission)\n\n**********\n\nLINKS FOR LAURIE PENNY:\n\nTwitter: @PennyRed\u00B7 \nWebsite: http://laurie-penny.com/\nInstagram: lauriepenny\n\n**********\n\nTALK BELIEFS: Exploring - and challenging - what and why we believe. \n\nFollow @talkbeliefs on Twitter! \nJoin the Talk Beliefs Facebook Page: http://bit.ly/2fCRLLF \nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.co.uk/talkbeliefs/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/talkbeliefs/\n\nWould you like to become a supporter of the Talk Beliefs YouTube channel?

It\u0027s a story of deceit, deception and ultimately destruction when the cult\u0027s followers turned on their leader by way of a suicide bombing.\n\nCALLIE SHANAFELT is a California based filmmaker whose father, uncle, and grandparents were in the Fountain cult. Her documentary, The Fountain, takes us on a journey of discovery to revisit the commune and come to terms with the horrific tragedy that took the lives of her grandparents.\n\nMARK from Talk Beliefs catches up with Callie, linking up with her in her editing studio in California, to talk about the documentary and reveal intriguing details and bizarre facts she uncovered during her research into the Fountain of the World cult.\n\nClips of Krishna Venta in London via https://www.britishpathe.com/\nMusic: \u0027Uluru\u0027 (Purple Planet): http://bit.ly/2wRZRDi\n\nLINKS FOR \u0027THE FOUNTAIN\u0027 DOCUMENTARY\n\nWEBSITE: http://www.thefountaindoc.com\nVIMEO: https://vimeo.com/ondemand/thefountain\n\n\nLINKS FOR CALLIE SHANAFELT\n\nWebsite: http://www.callieshanafelt.com\nTwitter: @CShanafelt\nSacred Land Film Project: http://www.sacredland.org\n\n\n\nTALK BELIEFS\n\nExploring - and challenging - what and why we believe.\n\nFollow @talkbeliefs on Twitter!\nTalk Beliefs Facebook http://bit.ly/2fCRLLF\n\nI love making #talkbeliefs content and appreciate every view, like, and share!

Many people believe him, and a community has risen around this mysterious man \u2013 a community some dismiss as a cult.\n\nTOM CLARKE, during his final year at Glasgow University, made it his mission to understand the Vissarion Community. Travelling to the Siberian Taiga forests, spending five days at the Abode of Dawn; he recorded his experiences, with footage ranging from a spine tingling ceremony to an interview with the supposed messiah himself.\n\nA deluded zealot who has deceived others? A cynical con-man with a flair for theater? Or maybe \u2013 just maybe -- something more? Watch and decide for yourself.\n\nPresented as part of Talk Beliefs\u0027 CULT VIEWING series.\n\n**********\n\nA very big thank you to Tom Clarke for his kind permission to use his film, \u0027Meeting the Son of God\u0027.\n\n\n**********\n\nTALK BELIEFS \nExploring - and challenging - what and why we believe. \n\nFollow @talkbeliefs on Twitter! \nJoin the Talk Beliefs Facebook http://bit.ly/2fCRLLF\nNEW!

      "description": "Today I check out a local \u0027Praise in the Park\u0027 - a Christian event in Cassiobury Park, Watford, UK, twenty miles outside of London. I speak to two evangelicals who have very different backgrounds - one who grew up in a Christian family, and one who knew nothing but atheism until an apparent miraculous event changed his mind. I ask both about challenges to their faith.\n\nMICHAEL was born into an evangelical family. He describes himself as being \u0027in the world but apart from it\u0027. He tells me he is concerned about the state of the world, what with single parent family \u0026 gay marriage being so prominent. When challenged, Michael calls upon the Holy Spirit.\n\nANDY came out of a humanist background. But when his troublemaker brother was healed from a gastric pain at a Christian event, Andy began to follow the teachings of Jesus \u0026 joined the neo-charismatic New Frontiers. But there are still challenges - like still trying to figure out why his mother got cancer within six months of becoming a Christian...\n\nMore on New Frontiers:\nI Grew Up in a Religious Cult in Essex http://bit.ly/2sriHmC\n\nTALK BELIEFS \nExploring - and challenging - what and why we believe. \n\nFollow @talkbeliefs on Twitter! \nTalk Beliefs Facebook http://bit.ly/2fCRLLF \n\nNEW!

This is a first for Talk Beliefs interviews, as Professor Burgess is a Creationist*. He regularly speaks at Creation events and has recently been interviewed by Ken Ham for Answers in Genesis.\n\nI catch up with Prof Burgess after his presentation, The Uniqueness of Man, and ask about his views on the human body as a complex structure, referring to his talk which highlights the many remarkable attributes of the human body and how we differ markedly from apes. \n\nAs a Creationist, Professor Burgess is concerned about how the teaching of evolution affects children, since it does not tell them that they are a special creation with a special purpose. \n\n*This particular interview was not intended to be confrontational, but more to explore how a creationist thinks. Hope you enjoy!\n\n********\nProf. Stuart Burgess\u0027 research interests include bio-inspired design, biomechanics and design in nature. He has worked as a professional designer and spent five years at the European Space Agency. As well as authoring several Creationist publications, he has published over 140 secular papers on the science of design, and as well as his work at Bristol University has also lectured Cambridge University.\n\nNOTE: The clips from the Uniqueness of Man talk are from another presentation that was held at an earlier date \u0026 venue, and can be seen in full here: http://bit.ly/2rqVAYE\n\nBy Stuart Burgess:\nHallmarks of Design: Evidence of Design in the Natural World http://amzn.to/2rpyYrv\n\n********\nFollow @talkbeliefs on Twitter!\n\nIn association with Evolution Soup: http://bit.ly/2qAcEev",

I am curious to know how this Englishman became a Hare Krishna and why he became convinced of its authenticity. \n\nAs a youth he read many religious texts, only finding the stories of blue Hindu god, Krishna, to make sense to him. What convinced him was realization through meditation - in other words, a feeling that is like no other. That, apparently, is the standard. \n\nBut believers from other faiths have told me exactly the same thing. I learn that faith is \u0027scientific\u0027 and that as a Hare Krishna you can actually see the gods while in spiritual trance. Also, good deeds are rewarded by Krishna, but ultimately, it is about pleasing him. Sounds suspiciously like all other faiths to me.\n\nFollow @TalkBeliefs on Twitter!\n\nIf you enjoy my chats, slideshows, and interviews, I\u0027d be very happy if you could support Talk Beliefs on Patreon!  \nhttp://bit.ly/1p7TSpz",

After a discussion about their favourite topic (why the world is so evil) I turn the conversation to things uniquely JW - specifically, disfellowshipping. \n\nIf a member of the congregation does something considered wrong or sinful (and this can be for the most innocuous of things), that person is expected to be \u0027disfellowshipped\u0027. Essentially, kicked out of the church. Not just that, ignored. \n\nBad enough if you are just another congregant, but what if your family is shunning you?

      "description": "Listen in on a local London church during one of their weekly public talk events addressing negative views of Christianity. This week tacked Christianity and homosexuality. Attendees were invited to anonymously text in questions that could then be put to the panel after the main talk.\n\nAfter building up an apologetic case designed to make modern Christians look sympathetic to LGBT rights and welcoming to gay people in general, the speakers then outlined why homosexuals can never have relationships, get married, or have sex if they want to join their church. \n\nAfter the event I approached two of the panel and let them know exactly what I thought of their event. \n\n[NOTE: If you\u0027d like to skip directly to me confronting the panel, it starts at 1:10:16]\n--------------------------\nBelow are a list of questions I had texted in before the event (questions with an asterisk are the questions they used):\n\nAs no Christian would condemn the emotional \u0026 sexual needs of heterosexuals,  is it in any way acceptable to condemn those of homosexuals?\n\n*If an openly gay couple wanted to join your church, would you expect them to give up their private sexual acts?\n\n* As Christians accept the Bible\u0027s condemnation of homosexuality,  why do they ignore other condemnations such as eating shrimp, getting tattoos,  women speaking in church, and stoning brides who aren\u0027t virgins?\n\n* Since science has identified the \u0027gay gene\u0027, and determined that homosexuality is not a choice, where does that leave the bible verses that call it an \u0027abomination\u0027 and \u0027detestable\u0027?\n\nChristians say marriage is for procreation \u0026 gays should be denied children.  So, then, are elderly and infertile couples who want to get married to be denied as well?\n\n* As homosexual behaviour has been documented in over 400 animal species,  \u0026 is therefore part of nature, how can Christians say it is \u0027unnatural\u0027?\n\n* = questions that were read out to the panel.\n\n(Even though I was surprised that they chose my deliberately challenging questions, you\u0027ll note that those questions of mine that they didn\u0027t select are the ones that could possibly put Christian heterosexuals in a bad light.)\n--------------------------\nThinking about leaving your religion?

Tales from ex-Scientologists about harassment, brainwashing, and constant demands for money (not to mention a central creed involving Space Aliens) has kept me from entering. \n\nBut today I put on my innocent \u0026 curious face and went inside to ask all about this mysterious self-help religion, and was greeted by a very bubbly Hungarian woman who answered all my questions - and sat me down in front of a short film about the almost too-good-to-be-true life of their founder, L Ron Hubbard. (Did I say \u0027almost\u0027?)\n\nThis is actually two encounters as I went back into the Center again later on that day.\n\nI survived, and wasn\u0027t followed home. Next time - the big Scientology Church on Queen Victoria Street. I can already feel my Thetans quivering.\n\nTalk Beliefs RSS feed: http://feeds.feedburner.com/youtube/NhFO\n--------------------------\nThinking about leaving your religion?
