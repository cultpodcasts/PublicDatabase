Before she knew it, her parents had whisked her away from normality in Rio de Janiero to a life of communes and cult-speak. Worst of all, she -- like other children within the sect -- found her identity virtually erased by the all-encompassing ego of the Guru.\n\nSam is a psychotherapist, supervisor and executive coach working with individuals and organisations \u2013 as well as one of the founders of Brighton and Hove Psychotherapy. Her perspective comes from many years working as a psychotherapist and understanding your history from a psychological as well as emotional angle.\n\n#cults #belief #rajneesh \n\n\n00:00 START\n01:36 Who were the Rajneeshees?\n04:32 Sucked in to the sect\n06:14 Growing up in the group\n14:54 The leader\n20:49 Leaving the cult \n25:36 Children of the cult\n30:18 Psychotherapy \n34:33 Is the cult still around?\n\n\n\nLINKS FOR SAM JAHARA\n\nSITE:\nhttps://www.brightonandhovepsychotherapy.com/\n\nTWITTER:\n@brightonpsych\nhttps://twitter.com/brightonpsych\n\nINSTA:\n@brightonhovepsychotherapy\nhttps://www.instagram.com/brightonhovepsychotherapy/\n\nFACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/brightonandhovepsychotherapy/\n\nLINKEDIN:\nhttps://bit.ly/3rGQDZT\n\nYOUTUBE:\nhttps://bit.ly/3K4aXvk\n\nWhy would you go and see a Psychotherapist?\nhttps://youtu.be/BgqC__pxKFM\n\nInterview with LILY DUNN: https://bit.ly/3mM3DKA\n\nBLOGS:\n\nDemystifying Mental Health Issues - https://bit.ly/3rEcG3a\n\nWomen and Anger - https://bit.ly/3Mi19yp\n\n\nFOOTAGE\n\nBrasil 1979 Rio de Janeiro -  via SUPER8 WORLD TOUR\n\nRajneeshpuram, Oregon, USA - Via Paolo Vitagliano\n\nBrighton and Hove - via VIC VideopIC\n\n\n\nIncidental music by the indomitable Chris Zabriskie: https://www.chriszabriskie.com/\n\nInterviews powered by https://streamyard.com/\n\n**********\n\nTALK BELIEFS: Exploring - and challenging - what and why we believe. \n\nThe Talk Beliefs YouTube Channel has been online since 2015 and has been featured on Reggie Yates\u0027 Extreme UK for BBC 3 Television.

      "description": "For many people, the Children of God is one of the world\u0027s most shocking and infamous religious cults. Beginning in the counterculture era of the late 1960s, founder David Berg soon introduced sexual elements to his spiritual message, encouraging open sexual contact between all members of his flock - including between adults and children.\n\nAuthor DANIELLA MESTYANEK YOUNG speaks with MARK from Talk Beliefs about growing up in the cult, performing in lewd videos as a youngster, and ultimately engineering her escape and joining the US Army. Free from the sect, she was shocked to find echoes of the cult within the military...\n\n\nLINKS FOR DANIELLA MESTYANEK YOUNG:\n\nSITE: https://daniellamestyanekyoung.com/\n\nBOOK SITE: https://uncultureyourself.com (coming soon)\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/daniellamestyanekyoung/\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/daniellamyoung\n\nTWITTER: @daniellamyoung\nhttps://twitter.com/daniellamyoung\n\nBLOG: https://daniellayoung.medium.com\n\nLINKTREE: https://linktr.ee/daniellamyoung\n\nARTICLE: \nhttps://narratively.com/i-escaped-the-cult-but-i-couldnt-escape-the-cult-mentality/\n\nLost in Transition | TEDxTacoma \nhttps://youtu.be/96gBf6LNxa4\n\n\nEX CHILDREN OF GOD HELP SITES:\n\nMoving On -- website created by and for young adults with parents who joined The Family/Children of God cult. https://movingon.org/\n\nhttp://www.exfamily.org/index.htm\n\n\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\nEducated: A Memoir by Tara Westover https://is.gd/oTWmR5\n\n\nIncidental music by the indomitable Chris Zabriskie: https://www.chriszabriskie.com/\n\nInterviews powered by https://streamyard.com/\n\n\u00A9 Copyright 2021 by Talk Beliefs (Re-use allowed with permission)\n\n**********\n\nTALK BELIEFS: Exploring - and challenging - what and why we believe. \n\nThe Talk Beliefs YouTube Channel has been online since 2015 and has been featured on Reggie Yates\u0027 Extreme UK for BBC 3 Television.

These include doctrines that protect those who would harm children and prohibit life-saving blood transfusions.\n\nMARK from Talk Beliefs along with MEG from the Meg Slaymaker YouTube channel document this first day of protest, talking to protesters, Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, and the public.\n\nThis version has some small extensions and fixes to the previous version available elsewhere on Talk Beliefs.\n\n**As of March 2019, a change has been made to the Jehovah\u0027s Witness\u0027 elders handbook regarding the Two Witness Rule in regards to sexual abuse. A second witness is no longer necessary, however the branch office must be called. Although it is still not advised to call the police this is the first time that the Two Witness Rule has bowed to pressure to change.\n\nPART TWO: http://bit.ly/2EZ8m6G\n\n\nLINKS:\n\nTwitter: @JWProtestUK \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jwprotest/\nJW Community Podcast https://apple.co/2OTrN3K\n#JWProtestUK\n\n\nMeg Slaymaker (exJW) YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/FdbTzX\n\n\nJW \u0026 unsure?\nhttp://jwsurvey.org\nhttp://jehovahswitnessreport.com\nhttp://www.jwfacts.com/\nhttp://exjwcriticalthinker.com\nThe Foundation: Foundation for the support and recovery of those affected by Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses : http://www.jwsupportfoundation.org/\n\n\nTALK BELIEFS\u0027 Jehovah\u0027s Witness Playlist Links:\n\nSecrets from the Cult - An Ex-Jehovah\u0027s Witness Speaks Out\nhttps://goo.gl/SNRjPn\n\nJehovah\u0027s Witnesses \u0027Two Witness Rule\u0027 ~ Explained\nhttps://goo.gl/cFKxFm\n\nFinally Awake: Interview With Lydia Finch - Ex-Jehovah\u0027s Witness\nhttps://goo.gl/xR4BrH\n\n\u00A9 Copyright 2019 by Talk Beliefs (Re-use allowed with permission)\n\n**********\n\nTALK BELIEFS: Exploring - and challenging - what and why we believe. \n\nThe Talk Beliefs YouTube Channel has been online since 2015 and has been featured on Reggie Yates\u0027 Extreme UK for BBC 3 Television.

Christian \u0027behavioral modification camps\u0027 exist to do one thing - take a child or teen who is not behaving in the Christian way, and fix them.  Most are taken there against their will, and many cannot leave even after their 18th birthday. \n\nMARSHA METZ is 43 years old and lives near Seattle, a survivor still haunted by her years in Escuela Caribe - a Christian reform camp in the Dominican Republic. From 16 to 19, she endured scrutiny and harsh punishments from employees meant to be caring houseparents and people of God.\n\nHere, Marsha speaks out with passion and great attention to detail about her time at the camp, and how it has affected her life since her return home.\n\nToday, she runs a support group for other survivors of Escuela Caribe. \n\n\nLINKS:\n\nTalk Beliefs Religious Boot Camps Video Playlist: http://bit.ly/2NTXdWx\n\n\nLINKS for Deirdre Sugiuchi:\nOfficial Site: https://deirdresugiuchi.com\nTwitter: @DJSugi \n\n\nORGANIZATIONS\n\nSIA - http://www.sia-now.org/\n\nPieces of Victory - http://piecesofvictory.com\n\n\nFACEBOOKS GROUPS\n\nSurvivors of New Horizons Youth Ministries http://bit.ly/2NQ9ivM\n\nNew Horizons Alumni Association FB http://bit.ly/2LW0YtX\n\n\nDOCUMENTARIES\n\nKidnapped for Christ (Documentary about Escuela Caribe): http://www.kidnappedforchrist.com/\n\n\nBOOKS\n\nJulia Scheeres (Author \u0027Jesus Land\u0027): http://www.juliascheeres.com\n\nShirley Jo Petersen (Author \u0027The Whisper\u0027): http://shirleyjopetersen.com/\n\nDeirdre Sugiuchi (Author \u0027Unreformed\u0027): https://deirdresugiuchi.com/\n\n\n\n\u00A9 Copyright 2018 by Talk Beliefs (Re-use allowed with permission)\n\n**********\n\nTALK BELIEFS: Exploring - and challenging - what and why we believe. \n\nFollow @talkbeliefs on Twitter! \nJoin the Talk Beliefs Facebook Group http://bit.ly/2fCRLLF \nJoin the Talk Beliefs Facebook Page: fb.me/talkbeliefs\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.co.uk/talkbeliefs/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/talkbeliefs/\n\nWould you like to help support Talk Beliefs or perhaps tell your own story in an interview?

His childhood in Malaysia in the 1960s, observing the casual racism of colonials, led to research into evolutionary psychology and human nature.\n\nLINKS FOR BARRY DESBOROUGH:\n\nTwitter: @BarryDesborough\n\nBlog: https://barryhisblog.blogspot.com\n\nEvidence for Evolution (Talk Beliefs Interview): http://bit.ly/2HMuyRo\n\n\n\u00A9 Copyright 2018 by Talk Beliefs (Re-use allowed with permission)\n\n**********\n\nTALK BELIEFS: Exploring - and challenging - what and why we believe. \n\nFollow @talkbeliefs on Twitter! \nJoin the Talk Beliefs Facebook Group http://bit.ly/2fCRLLF \nJoin the Talk Beliefs Facebook Page: fb.me/talkbeliefs\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.co.uk/talkbeliefs/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/talkbeliefs/\n\nChannel enquiries \u0026 direct messages: unchainedmind1@gmail.com\n\nWould you like to become a supporter of the Talk Beliefs YouTube channel?

Today, Jacky comes to the studio to give Mark and Neal an update on the Exclusive Brethren, their isolationist practices, and information for those within the sect who wish to leave.\n\nThe Exclusive Brethren (recently re-branded as the Plymouth Brethren) is a sect of Protestantism that practices \u0027exclusion from evil\u0027, that is, isolation from the world, even going as far as avoiding eating with non-brethren. \n\nMany who grow up in the sect are dissatisfied with this restrictive life and endeavor to leave, but family and doctrinal ties make leaving extremely difficult. There are often harsh punishments for those who do not tow the Brethren line...\n\n#exexclusivebrethren #cults #belief\n\n\n\nLINKS FOR THIS EPISODE:\n\nJacky Hart: My Escape from the Exclusive Brethren - A Talk \u0026 Presentation ~ Jacky Hart http://bit.ly/2toPW8l\n\nWikiPeebia - support website for anyone who is within the Exclusive Brethren and wishes to leave but is finding it difficult.

His childhood in Malaysia in the 1960s, observing the casual racism of colonials, led to research into evolutionary psychology and human nature - what is it about human beings that makes us behave the way we do, good and bad?\n\nBarry runs several Facebooks groups on the subject of evolution, and has contributed to Wikipedia.\n#talkbeliefs #evolution #science\n\nSEE ALSO: \n\nEvolution Facts Vs Creationist Fiction  - Dr Zachary Moore https://goo.gl/fRNGf3\n\nDigging Facts, Debunking Creationists ~ with Bill Ludlow https://goo.gl/7cMKuG \n\nLINKS FOR BARRY DESBOROUGH:\n\nCreation-Evolution blog: https://goo.gl/XhmtDw\nThe Rational Manifesto for One World https://goo.gl/Jh8UG3\nTwitter: @BarryDesborough\n\nERV FAQ:  https://goo.gl/fL3G6N\n\nWIKI: \nhttp://wikidia.wikispaces.com\nhttp://www.answers.com\nhttp://www.wikidia.wikispaces.com \n\nOther links related to this interview: https://goo.gl/zAQA4a\n\n\u00A9 Copyright 2017 by Talk Beliefs (Re-use allowed with permission)\n\n**********\n\nTALK BELIEFS: Exploring - and challenging - what and why we believe. \n\nFollow @talkbeliefs on Twitter! \nJoin the Talk Beliefs Facebook Page: http://bit.ly/2fCRLLF \n\nNEW!

      "description": "Today I check out a local \u0027Praise in the Park\u0027 - a Christian event in Cassiobury Park, Watford, UK, twenty miles outside of London. I speak to two evangelicals who have very different backgrounds - one who grew up in a Christian family, and one who knew nothing but atheism until an apparent miraculous event changed his mind. I ask both about challenges to their faith.\n\nMICHAEL was born into an evangelical family. He describes himself as being \u0027in the world but apart from it\u0027. He tells me he is concerned about the state of the world, what with single parent family \u0026 gay marriage being so prominent. When challenged, Michael calls upon the Holy Spirit.\n\nANDY came out of a humanist background. But when his troublemaker brother was healed from a gastric pain at a Christian event, Andy began to follow the teachings of Jesus \u0026 joined the neo-charismatic New Frontiers. But there are still challenges - like still trying to figure out why his mother got cancer within six months of becoming a Christian...\n\nMore on New Frontiers:\nI Grew Up in a Religious Cult in Essex http://bit.ly/2sriHmC\n\nTALK BELIEFS \nExploring - and challenging - what and why we believe. \n\nFollow @talkbeliefs on Twitter! \nTalk Beliefs Facebook http://bit.ly/2fCRLLF \n\nNEW!

      "description": "Talk Beliefs interviews Stuart Burgess, Professor of Engineering Design at the University of Bristol. This is a first for Talk Beliefs interviews, as Professor Burgess is a Creationist*. He regularly speaks at Creation events and has recently been interviewed by Ken Ham for Answers in Genesis.\n\nI catch up with Prof Burgess after his presentation, The Uniqueness of Man, and ask about his views on the human body as a complex structure, referring to his talk which highlights the many remarkable attributes of the human body and how we differ markedly from apes. \n\nAs a Creationist, Professor Burgess is concerned about how the teaching of evolution affects children, since it does not tell them that they are a special creation with a special purpose. \n\n*This particular interview was not intended to be confrontational, but more to explore how a creationist thinks. Hope you enjoy!\n\n********\nProf. Stuart Burgess\u0027 research interests include bio-inspired design, biomechanics and design in nature. He has worked as a professional designer and spent five years at the European Space Agency. As well as authoring several Creationist publications, he has published over 140 secular papers on the science of design, and as well as his work at Bristol University has also lectured Cambridge University.\n\nNOTE: The clips from the Uniqueness of Man talk are from another presentation that was held at an earlier date \u0026 venue, and can be seen in full here: http://bit.ly/2rqVAYE\n\nBy Stuart Burgess:\nHallmarks of Design: Evidence of Design in the Natural World http://amzn.to/2rpyYrv\n\n********\nFollow @talkbeliefs on Twitter!\n\nIn association with Evolution Soup: http://bit.ly/2qAcEev",

      "description": "Presentation by Mike Lawrence at the Reason Coffee Shop \u0026 Bookstore: \u0027Did Jesus Actually Exist?\u0027 (2015)\n\nAuthor and activist, Mike Lawrence presents the results of his exhaustive research into the origins of Jesus. Mike has unearthed evidence that Jesus was actually an invention based upon earlier mystical beliefs and then shoehorned into history to fall in line with certain events - chiefly the destruction of the Jewish Temple in 70 AD, and in this interview outlines the proof that can be found within religious and historical texts.\n\nSEE ALSO: Is This Proof Jesus Did Not Exist? http://bit.ly/231tCA3\n\nFollow @TalkBeliefs on Twitter!\n\nThank you to Neal Emery of Reason Coffee Shop \u0026 Bookstore for the kind use of this venue for this presentation.

She presents a frank, no-holds-barred, and often shocking account of her life within a bizarre and closed world of a faith than many people deem to be a cult.\n\nTopics covered include the practice of \u0027shunning\u0027 as well as allegations of child abuse within the sect.\n\nUPDATE: One week after Lydia\u0027s talk this report is released: Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses did not protect children from abuse, inquiry finds (28 November 2016): http://bit.ly/2fE2UX5\n\n*Apologies for variable quality of picture within this upload; recording is a rip from the Live Facebook event of Lydia\u0027s talk on the night.\n\nThank you to Neal Emery of Reason Coffee Shop \u0026 Bookstore for his kind permission to use the premises for this presentation: http://bit.ly/2aeBhGw\n\n08:00 Growing Up Jehovah\u0027s Witness\n32:01 The Practice of Shunning\n43:07 Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, Child Abuse, \u0026 The Royal Commission\n54:09 Questions \u0026 Answers\n\nTwitter: @TalkBeliefs\n\nSupport Talk Beliefs on Patreon! http://bit.ly/1p7TSpz\n---------\nLinks for Lydia Segebrecht (Lydia Finch):\n\nFollow Lydia on Twitter! @FinchLydia  \n\nEx-JW and struggling?

      "description": "A chance meeting (or is it?) with a Hare Krishna \u0027devotee\u0027 in a busy shopping thoroughfare. I am curious to know how this Englishman became a Hare Krishna and why he became convinced of its authenticity. \n\nAs a youth he read many religious texts, only finding the stories of blue Hindu god, Krishna, to make sense to him. What convinced him was realization through meditation - in other words, a feeling that is like no other. That, apparently, is the standard. \n\nBut believers from other faiths have told me exactly the same thing. I learn that faith is \u0027scientific\u0027 and that as a Hare Krishna you can actually see the gods while in spiritual trance. Also, good deeds are rewarded by Krishna, but ultimately, it is about pleasing him. Sounds suspiciously like all other faiths to me.\n\nFollow @TalkBeliefs on Twitter!\n\nIf you enjoy my chats, slideshows, and interviews, I\u0027d be very happy if you could support Talk Beliefs on Patreon!  \nhttp://bit.ly/1p7TSpz",

After a discussion about their favourite topic (why the world is so evil) I turn the conversation to things uniquely JW - specifically, disfellowshipping. \n\nIf a member of the congregation does something considered wrong or sinful (and this can be for the most innocuous of things), that person is expected to be \u0027disfellowshipped\u0027. Essentially, kicked out of the church. Not just that, ignored. \n\nBad enough if you are just another congregant, but what if your family is shunning you?

      "description": "Listen in on a local London church during one of their weekly public talk events addressing negative views of Christianity. This week tacked Christianity and homosexuality. Attendees were invited to anonymously text in questions that could then be put to the panel after the main talk.\n\nAfter building up an apologetic case designed to make modern Christians look sympathetic to LGBT rights and welcoming to gay people in general, the speakers then outlined why homosexuals can never have relationships, get married, or have sex if they want to join their church. \n\nAfter the event I approached two of the panel and let them know exactly what I thought of their event. \n\n[NOTE: If you\u0027d like to skip directly to me confronting the panel, it starts at 1:10:16]\n--------------------------\nBelow are a list of questions I had texted in before the event (questions with an asterisk are the questions they used):\n\nAs no Christian would condemn the emotional \u0026 sexual needs of heterosexuals,  is it in any way acceptable to condemn those of homosexuals?\n\n*If an openly gay couple wanted to join your church, would you expect them to give up their private sexual acts?\n\n* As Christians accept the Bible\u0027s condemnation of homosexuality,  why do they ignore other condemnations such as eating shrimp, getting tattoos,  women speaking in church, and stoning brides who aren\u0027t virgins?\n\n* Since science has identified the \u0027gay gene\u0027, and determined that homosexuality is not a choice, where does that leave the bible verses that call it an \u0027abomination\u0027 and \u0027detestable\u0027?\n\nChristians say marriage is for procreation \u0026 gays should be denied children.  So, then, are elderly and infertile couples who want to get married to be denied as well?\n\n* As homosexual behaviour has been documented in over 400 animal species,  \u0026 is therefore part of nature, how can Christians say it is \u0027unnatural\u0027?\n\n* = questions that were read out to the panel.\n\n(Even though I was surprised that they chose my deliberately challenging questions, you\u0027ll note that those questions of mine that they didn\u0027t select are the ones that could possibly put Christian heterosexuals in a bad light.)\n--------------------------\nThinking about leaving your religion?

(Did I say \u0027almost\u0027?)\n\nThis is actually two encounters as I went back into the Center again later on that day.\n\nI survived, and wasn\u0027t followed home.

      "description": "A local Baptist church is teeming with would-be evangelists, taking the (moral and actual) high ground on busy shopping thoroughfares to bellow and bluster about how we are all going to burn in Hell unless we accept the loving saviour, Jesus Christ.\n\nThey are there most days (except Sundays - duh) in groups. One preaches to the indifferent shoppers while others hand out tracts or offer booklets from an open suitcase.\n\nAfter engaging them in conversations several times over the past few months, these guys know me pretty well. In this audio I approach their mini-bookstand and examine one of their tracts, which propounds many creationist arguments and explains how the banana was obviously designed by a God for Man\u0027s convenience.\n\nYou may want to skip to 1.40 - that is where I come in. :-)\n\nTwitter: @TalkBeliefs\n--------------------------\nThinking about leaving your religion?

He was intelligent and thoughtful, and gave great answers to my queries.\n\nThis was one of my first exchanges with theists, so was perhaps a bit too confrontational, but I think I gave this young guy a few things to think about. :-)\n\nTwitter: @TalkBeliefs\n\nMormon \u0026 unsure?\nhttp://www.exmormon.org/\nhttp://www.exmormonfoundation.org/\nhttp://www.iamanexmormon.com/\n\nMormon Spiritual Experiences Podcast (host: ex Mormon, Shawn) http://bit.ly/2cmyxDU\n--------------------------\nThinking about leaving your religion?
