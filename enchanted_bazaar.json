      "description": "Lilia Tarawa\u0027s quote encapsulates the complexity of growing up in a cult, where experiences can be both heavenly and hellish. It\u0027s a poignant reminder of how such environments can create a mixture of profound belonging and profound suffering for those involved.\nLilia Tarawa is a New Zealand author, speaker, and advocate who gained attention for her memoir \u0022Daughter of Gloriavale: My Life in a Religious Cult.\u0022 She was born into the Gloriavale Christian Community, a closed religious sect in New Zealand. Her book recounts her experiences growing up in the cult and her journey to break free from its constraints. The quote you provided, \u0022I grew up in a cult. It was heaven -- and hell,\u0022 succinctly encapsulates the complex and conflicting emotions she experienced within the cult environment.",
