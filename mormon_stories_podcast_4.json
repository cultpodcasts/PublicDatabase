      "description": "Today we\u2019re premiering part one of our epic interview with an awesome mother and daughter duo, Linda and Savannah Clyde. Growing up in a mixed-faith Mormon home, Linda worked through the resentment she felt towards her father\u2019s lack of belief in the church with beautiful results. Linda\u2019s talents as a writer eventually landed her a job at LDS church headquarters in the marketing department where she was instrumental in assisting the church soften it\u2019s tone and messaging. Hearing her talk about the inner workings of the church is fascinating stuff to say the least! Once an extremely faithful teenager, Linda\u2019s daughter Savannah\u2019s curious spirit led her to dig deeper into the narrative of the church and become a new kind of pioneer for her Mormon family.\n Listen along as they describe their journey to understanding one another, their non-Mormon loved ones, and the beauty that can come from embracing non-conformity as a family in Utah county.",

      "description": "In September of 2020, professional Mormon apologists Terryl and Fiona Givens were invited to speak at a Mormon church fireside for the Sunderland England Stake of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\u00A0 During this fireside Terryl Givens was asked to recount an experience he once had with a Mormon missionary woman who was doubting her testimony because of troubling things she learned about Mormon church founder Joseph Smith,\u00A0 Terryl\u0027s recounting of the story was as follows:\n \u0022I was fortunate that there was a mission president in our area who knew us and our work.\u00A0 And there was a sister missionary who decided that she was going to leave the church.\u00A0 She was finishing her mission the next week and she\u0027d made the decision to go home and leave.\u00A0 And her companion of course deeply distraught over this and asked the mission president \u0022Could we go talk to brother Givens?\u0022\u00A0 And he gave them permission to come and stay as long as they needed so they stayed long into the night.\u00A0 And I listened to one after another question and then finally it occurred to me to ask this one question.\u00A0 And I said to her in regard to one question in particular about Joseph Smith, and I said \u0022Sister\u0022 I said, \u0022Why does the answer to that question matter?\u0022\u00A0 And it changed everything.\u00A0 It just caught her up short.\u00A0 And she thought for a minute and she said, \u0022I don\u0027t know\u0022 (Terryl chuckles).\u00A0 \u0022I don\u0027t know.\u0022\n Many (including myself) were disturbed by Terryl Givens\u0027 story/response - particularly since it was directed at currently doubting Mormon church members.\u00A0 We were primarily puzzled, shocked, and somewhat disturbed that the Mormon church\u0027s leading professional apologist - who has spent many years writing books for, and speaking/ministering to doubting Mormons - would provide such a glib and seemingly uninformed response.\u00A0 That said, we understand that belief issues are complex, and take Terryl at his word that he sincerely does not understand why troubling aspects of Mormon history, including newly-discovered details about Joseph Smith\u0027s life, would matter to a questioning or doubting Mormon.\n Consequently, I am launching a new social media campaign with which I could use your help.\u00A0 The goal of the campaign is to help educate Terryl, Fiona, other Mormon Church apologists, and the Mormon church leadership about as to why \u0022Informed Consent\u0022 is crucial to both active Mormons and Mormon investigators.",

      "description": "Recovering Agency - Examining Mormon Mind Control Pt. 1 (with Luna Lindsey Corbden) Luna Lindsey Corbden is the author of \u0022Recovering Agency - Lifting the Veil of Mormon Mind Control.\u0022 In this multi-part Mormon Stories Podcast series, Lindsey employs the tools of social psychology to identify ways in which the Mormon church uses various coercive techniques often associated with high demand religions (also referred to as cults). Throughout the series we will be asking, \u0022In what ways does the Mormon church behave in ways similar to other high demand religions (or cults), and what can it do to become less cult-like?\u0022\n The primary goal of this series is to help people raised within the Mormon Church unpack and separate their own identity from church doctrine and policies. In their book. Luna explores 31 different mind control techniques used by high demand religions generally, and by the Mormon church specifically.\n In Part 1, we explore the basics of how cognitive dissonance works, and we will cover the first six methods (of the 31 in total): Sacred Sciene, Demand for Purity, Doctrine Over Self, Black \u0026 White Thinking, Blame Reversal, and Guilt \u0026 Shame.\n And, if you have not already, tune in to my most recent livestream (episode number 1442) for an introduction to this fascinating series!\n --------\n Luna Corbden (who also writes as Luna Lindsey) was born into the LDS Church and left the faith in 2001, at age 26. They now live in Washington state and write about topics of interest to them, including psychology, mind control, culture, and autism. They also write science fiction and fantasy novels, and write short stories for speculative fiction publications like the Journal of Unlikely Entomology, Crossed Genres, and the Recognize Fascism anthology. When they\u0027re not busy traveling to improbable worlds, they\u0027re thinking hard about this improbable world.\n Luna\u0027s book can be found here: https://recoveringagency.com\n Show Notes:\n   Recovering Agency: Lifting the Veil of Mormon Mind Control by Luna Lindsey Corbden \u0022Ideas on Singularity and Post-Human Intelligence,\u0022 by Luna Lindsey Corbden  \u0022The Psychology of Religion with Dr. James Nagel,\u0022 Mormon Stories \u0022What the Mormon Church Can Learn from Cults to Do/Be Better,\u0022 Steven Hassan on Mormon Stories  \u0022How to Help a Loved One Who Believes in QAnon,\u0022 Steven Hassan on Mormon Stories  Combating Cult Mind Control: The Guide to Protection, Rescue, and Recovery from Destructive Cults by Steven Hassan  Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism: A study of \u0022brainwashing\u0022 in China by Robert Jay Lifton  A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance by Leon Festinger  Escaping Utopia: Growing Up in a Cult, Getting Out, and Starting Over by Janja Lalich  Take Back Your Life: Recovering from Cults and Abusive Relationships by Janja Lalich and Madeleine Tobias  Captive Hearts, Captive Minds: Freedom and Recovery from Cults and Other Abusive Relationships by Janja Lalich and Madeleine Tobias  Cults in Our Midst: The Continuing Fight Against Their Hidden Menace by Margaret Thaler Singer  Recovery from Cults: Help for Victims of Psychological and Spiritual Abuse by Michael Langone  Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion by Robert Cialdini International Cultic Studies Association  When Prophecy Fails by Leon Festinger  \u0022Obedience Brings Blessings,\u0022 Thomas S.

      "description": "This week we celebrate the birthday of faithful Mormon historian and scholar Richard Bushman \u2013 author of Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling, and former Mormon church stake president and patriarch.\n Some of you will remember that I had the privilege of interviewing Richard back in 2007. Most of you probably don\u2019t know that Richard agreed to discuss 10 topics on the series, but quit the interview after only addressing 3 of the 10 topics, which was very disappointing to me at the time. But of course that was his prerogative.\n Since our original interview, Richard has declined to appear on Mormon Stories Podcast again \u2013 especially after my excommunication from the Mormon Church in 2015. Still, there are many questions that I would like to ask Richard (or any believing Mormon scholar), if he (they) would allow it. Unfortunately most faithful Mormon scholars avoid any forums where they are asked candid, difficult questions. This is not their fault, of course. It\u2019s the price of doing business with a church that silences and punishes its truth-tellers.\n Consequently, I am recording a personal episode where I go ahead and ask the questions I\u2019ve been wanting to ask Richard, along with expressing a few concerns with some of Richard\u2019s public statements over the years.\n I hope you enjoy! If you enjoy this episode, I may do something similar a few other faithful scholars/historians/apologists.",

Only recently did Kelly start to investigate the troubling issues with Mormon history that had been eating away at her children.

Teenage years filled with the unimaginable amounts of shame and guilt, Kayla was able to grow into her own independent, confident adult, even winning Miss Salt Lake City and making her platform one of advocacy for the Utah Pride Center.\n We are honored to interview two thoughtful, articulate women putting a lot on the line to speak out while Kelly\u2019s husband still currently serves as her bishop!\n Warning: This episode contains discussions of self-harm.\n Show Notes:\n  Last Podcast on the Left Mormonism episode\u00A0 \u0022Ghost of Eternal Polygamy\u0022 by Carolyn Pearson \u00A0Gift of the Mormon Faith Crisis podcast\u00A0 Jennifer Fife Donna Showalter Mormon Stories Podcast Episode Leah and Cody Young Mormon Stories Podcast Episode \u0022Listen, Learn and Love\u0022 by Richard Ostler \u00A0Follow Kayla on Instagram",

This turns into hyper-vigilance as a newlywed and mother, even going as far as to use a marker to \u201Ccensor\u201D cleavage on cartoon characters on a family board game!\n Things started to unravel for Lexi when a trusted Bishop is arrested for sexually assaulting minors in her ward and when a close friend starts questioning the Church. Hoping to help her friend and shore up her own shaken testimony, Lexi starts researching LDS Church history and truth claims with devastating results. An early conversation with her father during this time wakes Lexi up to the harm silence causes and gives her the courage to start speaking out and speaking up.\n Find Lexi on Social Media:\n  YouTube TikTok Instagram Twitter   Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

      "description": "Join us now for Part 3 of what many are calling a truly groundbreaking Mormon Stories Podcast series - my interview with teen convert, former All-American athlete, and former Mormon seminary teacher and CES employee Marc Oslund.\n In today\u0027s episode Marc shares with us:\n  An insider\u0027s view of how the Mormon church began realizing that it was hemorrhaging its youth and young adults, and how the church has experimented in seminary/institute/CES with both \u0022inoculation\u0022 and \u0022avoidance\u0022 when confronting its long-denied problematic history. How the Mormon church relied on Terryl Givens and other progressive Mormons to help re-train Mormon CES employees, the backlash that ensued from orthodox instructors and managers, and how the Mormon church worked hard to simultaneously distance itself from Terryl Givens\u0027 teachings. An observation that Mormon apostles no longer act as guardians of doctrine and theology, and how they have now \u0022outsourced\u0022 that work to progressive theologians like Terryl Givens and others, in part so that they can maintain plausible deniability. Marc\u0027s transition from an orthodox Mormon to a progressive/liberal (Terryl Givens)-type Mormon as a Mormon seminary teacher, in response to the training the church provided him, and how that ultimately undermined his own career in CES. How Marc was ultimately and literally pushed out of CES for explicitly following the advice of Mormon apostles like Elder Ballard to openly discuss the problematic issues. How the CES System continues to promote orthodox leaders in spite of its lip service to promoting openness and tolerance for diversity.  You will not regret the length and depth of this interview.",

Fascinating for so many reasons, I believe this is one of the most important Mormon Stories Podcast episodes I\u0027ve ever released.\n  Marc was a heavily recruited high school baseball and football player in the L.A., California area. He converted to the Mormon church as a teen. He was drafted to the baseball Major Leagues three different times, and turned down those offers to go on an LDS mission and to BYU. He was an all-American baseball player at BYU. He served an LDS mission where he was often racked with guilt and shame - almost sent home for it. When his baseball career ended (due to post-mission injuries), he became a Mormon CES seminary teacher, and served from around 2013 to 2019 - while the Mormon church was trying to become more open/honest about its history, and deal with public activists like Kate Kelly, myself, Sam Young, Jeremy Runnells, etc. Even though he constantly had doubts/questions/concerns, his position as a seminary teacher caused major rifts in his marriage when his wife expressed occasional doubts, specifically about the Mormon temple ceremony. Marc became a liberal/progressive/Givens Mormon while a seminary teacher - but was punished by CES for his progressive stances. Marc ultimately lost his orthodox Mormon faith as a seminary teacher, and was pressured to quit his job.  In part 2 of his story, we will hear about Marc\u0027s experience working for the Church Educational System as a seminary teacher, his attempts to be open with students about church doctrines, and why he eventually began to question the leadership of the LDS church - all while working within the CES program.",

For decades, the Department of Educations has granted Title IX exemptions allowing dozens of religious colleges like BYU and Liberty University to discriminate based on sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation, even when they receive millions of taxpayer dollars every single year.\n Join us today at 4:00 pm MT as we interview attorney Paul Southwick, Chandler Horning (BYU) and Luke Wilson (Liberty University), about their groundbreaking class action lawsuit filed against the Department of Education. Chandler and Luke are among 33 former and current students from different federally-funded religious colleges who have been harmed by their discriminatory policies. The lawsuit argues that the Title IX religious exemptions \u201Cas applied to sexual and gender minority students, is unconstitutional and that the Department must enforce the protections of Title IX at all taxpayer-funded educational institutions, including at those institutions that discriminate and cause harm on the basis of sincerely held religious beliefs.\u201D",

      "description": "This week Mormonism and the world (basically) have been captivated by the new Netflix Documentary \u0022Murder Among the Mormons\u0022 - which covers the Salt Lake City bombings of 1985, and is currently #2 in the USA on Netflix.\u00A0 (SPOILER ALERT!!!!)\n While reactions to the documentary (produced \u0026 directed by friends Jared Hess and Tyler Measom) have been universally SUPER positive, many progressive and post-Mormons have expressed a wish that the documentary would have spent more time discussing the role of the Mormon church in: a) creating the environment that gave rise to the bombings, b) attempting to cover up/hide its problematic history, and c) obstruct or hinder the investigation of the bombings.\n I this epic, 2-part, 6 hour interview with Mormon/Ex-Mormon legend Sandra Tanner, we cover many of the questions/topics/issues that progressive and post-Mormons have been wanting to know about the Mormon church, Mark Hofmann, the bombings, and the investigations, such as:\n  What do we know about Mark Hofmann\u0027s childhood and adolescent years? When and how did Mark Hofmann lose his Mormon faith? What are some of the direct and undeniable similarities between Joseph Smith and Mark Hofmann? What can we ascertain about Mark Hofmann\u0027s possible motives for forgery? What issues regarding Mormon Church truth claims were being discussed publicly during Mark Hofmann\u0027s childhood and adolescence years, and what written materials may have influenced him? What behavior on the part of the Mormon church in the 1960s and 1970s may have served as motivating factors for Hofmann?\u00A0 Particularly, to what extent did the LDS Church participate in overt deception of its members that could have influenced him to turn on the church? What are Sandra\u0027s memories of Hofmann and his close associates like Shannon Flynn, Brent Metcalfe, Curt Bench, Lyn Jacobs, Brent Ashworth, etc.?\u00A0 Were any of them suspected as accomplices? What do we know about the main Mormon-related Hofmann forgeries, and why were each relevant from a Mormon.history perspective?\u00A0 How did Hofmann\u0027s forgeries intersect with and challenge Mormon church truth claims?\u00A0 How did they stand to harm the church? What role did the Mormon church play in hiding and/or covering up Hofmann\u0027s forgeries? Perhaps most importantly, Sandra recounts the inspiring story of her husband, Jerald Tanner, discovering that Hofmann\u0027s Salamander Letter was a forgery a FULL YEAR before the bombings, how she and Jerald fought about his discovery, what Hofmann\u0027s reaction was to Jerald\u0027s discovery, and how it was received in the larger Mormon studies and news community (spoiler alert: it was largely ignored). Sandra also movingly discusses how she and Jerald were largely ignored and marginalized by the broader Mormon history community, including being denied a display table at Sunstone, and how many Mormon history scholars would take advantage of the Tanner\u0027s research without giving them any credit or citations.\u00A0 She cites as the main reason of this mistreatment her and Jerald\u0027s willingness to question Joseph Smith\u0027s sincerity - which remains a taboo in the Mormon studies community to this day. Sandra recounts her memories of the bombings and of the investigations. Perhaps most importantly, what responsibility does the Mormon church play in contributing to the environment and led to the bombings?  All this, and so much more.\u00A0 This is a 6 hour interview.\n  Part 1 (4 hours) talks mostly about Sandra\u0027s memories during and after the bombings. Part 2 (2 hours) focuses more on Sandra\u0027s direct reactions to the documentary Murder Among the Mormons.  For your convenience we have created time codes that will let you know which parts of the videos you can jump to (if you want to jump around or refer certain parts to friends).\n We hope you enjoy!!!!!!!\u00A0 And a HUGE thanks to Sandra (and Jerald) Tanner for sharing with us her/their historic insight.\u00A0 For me, this was a true honor.\u00A0 MORE TO COME!!!!\n - John Dehlin (March 10, 2021)\n P.S.",

      "description": "\u0022View of the Hebrews\u0022 is a book first published in 1823 by Ethan Smith of Vermont.\u00A0 In \u0022View of the Hebrews,\u0022 Ethan Smith argues (among other things) that the Native Americans were descended from the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel.\u00A0 This book was so popular that it had a second printing in 1825. \u00A0\n Mormon General Authorities and apologists have feared \u0022View of the Hebrews\u0022 for over a century, starting with B.H. Roberts in the early 1900s.\n Why is \u0022View of the Hebrews\u0022\u00A0 potentially problematic for the Mormon church and the Book of Mormon?\u00A0 A few reasons:\n  Joseph Smith claimed to have come up with the idea for the Book of Mormon the VERY SAME YEAR (1823) that \u0022View of the Hebrews\u0022 was first published.\u00A0 Coincidence? Ethan Smith (the author of \u0022View of the Hebrews\u0022) was Oliver Cowdery\u0027s pastor in Vermont PRIOR to his working with Joseph Smith as Book of Mormon \u0022scribe,\u0022 and it is certain that Cowdery was familiar with the book.\u00A0 Coincidence? Mormon General Authority and historian B.H. Roberts wrote hundreds of pages doing research on the disturbing similarities between View of the Hebrews and the Book of Mormon.\u00A0 Later, B.H. Roberts went on to lose his testimony in the historicity of the Book of Mormon.\u00A0 Coincidence?  Recently, the brilliant Radio Free Mormon decided to read \u0022View of the Hebrews\u0022 from cover to cover to see what the \u0022hubub\u0022 is all about. \u00A0\n Join us as we explore the following questions:\n  What is View of the Hebrews fundamentally about? What are the important similarities and differences between View of the Hebrews and the Book of Mormon? Was Ethan Smith\u0027s \u0022View of the Hebrews\u0022 a source of inspiration for the Book of Mormon? What cultural dynamics were at play in upstate New York in the early 1820s that could have influenced BOTH books? Are there any direct connections between \u0022View of the Hebrews\u0022 and Joseph Smith? Why has \u0022View of the Hebrews\u0022 caused so much concern for Mormon apologists, from B.H. Roberts to today ? How have Mormon apologists responded to View of the Hebrews? Does \u0022View of the Hebrews\u0022 present significant, compelling problems for LDS Church and Book of Mormon truth claims?",

      "description": "Chelsea and Nick Homer were both raised as devout Utah Mormons - with all the good and bad this entailed, and both were equally determined to have the perfect Mormon marriage and family.\u00A0\u00A0After meeting at BYU and an extended, careful courtship, Chelsea and Nick were married in the Bountiful temple. Then their Mormon dream immediately began to fray.\n Beginning with the wedding night/honeymoon, Chelsea and Nick experienced problems with sexual intimacy, due (in large part) to unhealthy messages they received around sexual \u0022purity\u0022 and \u0022modesty\u0022 as Mormon teens.\u00A0\u00A0Then, a year into their marriage, Nick began to lose his testimony in the Mormon church - causing Nick and Chelsea to seriously contemplate divorce.\n When it became clear that Nick was not going to perform the priesthood blessing for their their firstborn child, Chelsea and Nick decided to courageously post about their situation on her Instagram account, in part to defy the shaming and unhealthy rumors that so often accompany this situation within Mormonism (e.g., \u0022Nick must be into PORN!\u0022). This post was dated September 24, 2017.\n Surprisingly to both Chelsea and Nick, a Public Relations employee for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints asked if Chelsea would write a post about this experience for the Church\u2019s Instagram.\u00A0This post (dated February 7, 2018) can be found here, and to date has 58,947 \u0022likes.\u0022\u00A0 Later, the LDS Church PR department asked Chelsea to author an article about navigating her Mormon mixed-faith marriage as a believing wife.\u00A0 This heavily correlated article is entitled \u0022Who Do I Choose - God or My Husband? - and was published by lds.org on July 25, 2018.\n After these social media posts, Chelsea and Nick immediately began receiving messages, emails, and phone calls from other young Mormon couples also experiencing faith crises and/or mixed-faith marriages.\u00A0\u00A0To help provide support and community for all the young Mormon women who were struggling with faith crises, Chelsea formed on July 31, 2019 a Facebook group entitled \u0022Faith Journey Meetups,\u0022 which at present has over 2,000 members.\u00A0\u00A0The description of this group is as follows:\n  Welcome! This is a meetup hub for women who are actively navigating their personal faith journeys anywhere along the LDS belief spectrum. Come, make friends, schedule get-togethers. This is a safe place to find support and turn internet acquaintances into real life friends.\n  Eventually, Chelsea also lost her faith in the Mormon church, and today Nick and Chelsea are navigating a life of healing, growth, and joy after Mormonism.\n This is their story.",

I am planning some super-cool interviews for the newly released \u0022Murder Among the Mormons\u0022 documentary (released today on Netflix).\u00A0 A few SUPER important requests for you all:  Please watch it ASAP!\u00A0It\u0027s fantastic! Please share it with all your believing Mormon family members and friends.\u00A0 If they are concerned about the content, consider letting them know that:  Richard Turley (former assistant LDS Church historian and head of LDS Church Public Affairs) participates in the documentary, and The documentary was carefully designed by both Jared and Tyler to be fair/balanced.\u00A0 In my opinion, the doc is TOTALLY TBM worthy, so please watch it AND tell everyone about it!    I am planning several super cool interviews, including an interview with Directors - Jared Hess and Tyler Measom.\u00A0 So stay tuned for that! Here\u0027s where I need your help.\u00A0 I would REALLY love it if you would share with me: a) your reactions to the doc, and b) any questions you have for Jared and Tyler. This will help me make the most of time with them (which I see as precious).\u00A0 It will also stand as a cool record of progressive and post-Mormon reactions to the film. Please post your reactions here! If you want to watch additional coverage of the Mark Hofmann bombings on Mormon Stories Podcast, you can check out the following episodes:  An interview with Allen D. Roberts and Curt Bench about Mark Hofmann. An interview with Brent Metcalfe - personal friend of Mark Hofmann.

      "description": "Hey Mormon Stories Listeners - I need your help!!!! This Friday (9am mountain time) I will be interviewing Mike Rinder - a former high-level leader of the Church of Scientology. I only have an hour with Mike, so I want to spend at least a few minutes of the hour comparing the Mormon church with the Church of Scientology. To be clear - I have studied Scientology enough to know that it is deeply problematic....from literally kidnapping/imprisoning members, to having members physically beaten, to militantly suing members, etc. In short, I know that Scientology is a brutal, inhumane, super-harmful cult. Consequently, I am also fully aware that any comparison between the Mormon church and the Church of Scientology is deeply fraught. But hear me out. I once read in Jared Diamond\u0027s \u0022Guns, Germs, and Steel\u0022 that sometimes the less immediately lethal viruses are often the most harmful viruses overall, primarily BECAUSE they are less deadly than their counterparts. In other words, if a virus is so deadly that it immediately kills its hosts, it has a tougher time spreading, and ultimately harms fewer organisms. Conversely, if a virus doesn\u0027t kill its host, but makes its hosts sick enough for a long enough time, the virus can spread much more successfully to a much larger population, and do more harm overall to many more people . Get it? And so this is where I would like your feedback...and it\u0027s only an intellectual exercise. Here is the question: If the variables we are measuring include: 1) Total human hours extracted from members without fully informed consent (total hours wasted under false pretenses, in a sense), 2) Total abuse/pain/suffering inflicted on humans under false pretenses, and 3) Total $$$ amount fraudulently extracted from its members over the lifetime of the church....again, under false pretenses and without informed consent.... ...could an argument be made that the Mormon church, in aggregate, causes more overall harm than the Church of Scientology...in part BECAUSE it is somewhat less severe overall? Also, what arguments/points am I missing? Please make your best case below (one way or the other), and I will do my best to incorporate your input into my discussion with Mike Rinder on Friday. Also, if you have any questions for Mike, please share them below and I will try my best to incorporate them. THANKS IN ADVANCE! John Dehlin P.S. Please know that I KNOW that the Mormon Church does a TON of good in the world (particularly for its members). Believe me....I see that, and I believe that. I am talking about the harm that the Mormon Church causes IN SPITE of all the good it does as well.",

      "description": "Please join me as I interview Dr. William L. Davis about his book \u0022Visions in a Seer Stone: Joseph Smith and the Making of the Book of Mormon.\u0022\n In this interdisciplinary work, William L. Davis examines Joseph Smith\u0027s 1829 creation of the Book of Mormon, the foundational text of the Latter Day Saint movement. Positioning the text within the history of early American oratorical techniques, sermon culture, educational practices, and the passion for self-improvement, Davis elucidates both the fascinating cultural contexts for the creation of the Book of Mormon and the central role of oral culture in early nineteenth-century America.\n Drawing on performance studies, religious studies, literary culture, and the history of early American education, Davis analyzes Smith\u2019s process of oral composition. How did he produce a history spanning a period of 1,000 years, filled with hundreds of distinct characters and episodes, all cohesively tied together in an overarching narrative? Eyewitnesses claimed that Smith never looked at notes, manuscripts, or books\u2014he simply spoke the words of this American religious epic into existence. Judging the truth of this process is not Davis\u0027s interest. Rather, he reveals a kaleidoscope of practices and styles that converged around Smith\u0027s creation, with an emphasis on the evangelical preaching styles popularized by the renowned George Whitefield and John Wesley.\n William L. Davis, an independent scholar, holds a Ph.D. in theater and performance and has published in Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought; John Bunyan Studies: A Journal of Reformation and Nonconformist Culture; Leviathan: A Journal of Melville Studies; Style; Text and Performance Quarterly; and Textual Cultures.\n Dr. William L. Davis\u2019 book, \u201CVisions in a Seer Stone: Joseph Smith and the Making of the Book of Mormon\u201D can be purchased in the following ways:\n University of North Carolina Press\n Amazon",

      "description": "Please join me as Neon Trees front man Tyler Glenn and award-winning pianist and composer Paul Cardall return to Mormon Stories Podcast to premiere a new music video: \u0022I Know It Hurts\u0022, from Paul Cardall\u0027s memoir-style album \u0022The Broken Miracle.\u0022 We would welcome your questions for Tyler and Paul during this live Q\u0026A.\n \n   \u00A0\n \n   \u201CI Know It Hurts\u201D was co-written by Cardall and Glenn after they met several years ago at the famed LOVELOUD Festival, where they were both performing. Glenn is co-founder of the festival, alongside Imagine Dragon\u2019s Dan Reynolds.\n \n   \u00A0\n \n   \u201CBefore writing this song, Tyler and I discussed at length the challenges we all feel that result from trauma,\u201D Cardall explains. \u201CIn my case, though my heart transplant was a beautifully orchestrated miracle, it was still the grand finale to a lot of years of medical trauma. It triggered anxiety and depression. For everyone who is suffering, not necessarily physically, but because they are different or feel like an outsider, I want to say to them, \u2018I know it hurts.\u2019 This song acknowledges that you are not alone. This song validates our feelings in a way that says, \u2018keep going, keep fighting, we understand.\u2019\u201D\n \n   \u00A0\n \n   Glenn adds,\n \n   \u00A0\n \n   \u201CI wanted the lyric and performance of this song to convey a sense of understanding how it feels to get through a trauma or heartache. So much of life for many is the search for a sense of belonging, a sense of self-worth. This song feels more like an acknowledgement of that, and I hope it brings a feeling of being seen and comforted. I hope those in pain from whatever it may be, feel a sense of validation.\u201D\n \n   \u00A0\n \n   The video, directed by Rob Norbutt, is in stark black and white, the simplicity of which amplifies the power of the message:\n \n   \u00A0\n \n   You\u2019ve been floating out in space\n \n   You just wanted to believe\n \n   There were tears upon your face\n \n   And your body felt no ease\n \n   Dear God is there not more\n \n   Cuz it\u2019s cold on the church floor\n \n   \u00A0\n \n   Cardall\u2019s new album is more than a colorful collection of 19 emotionally-charged songs. The Broken Miracle is a musical memoir, a personal manifesto that celebrates a life filled with nearly unfathomable tragedy and heady triumph. An enthusiastic collaborator, Cardall welcomes an all-star cast of creative partners on The Broken Miracle. The title track was penned with Christian music veteran Matt Hammitt and Carter Forge, and is sung by Hammitt. \u201CBroken Machine\u201D features singer/songwriter Rachael Yamagata\u2019s vocals on the tune Cardall co-wrote with Yamagata and Trevor Price. In addition to Glenn, the project also includes appearances by Ty Herndon, J. Daniel, and Akelee; while pop star David Archuleta sings the power-ballad \u201CMy Heart Beats for You.\u201D His collaboration with Thompson Square on \u201CAll I See is Snow\u201D was declared \u201C the Christmas song of the pandemic.\u201D\n \n   \u00A0\n \n   Cardall\u2019s evolution as an artist continues with the release of The Broken Miracle, a title inspired by his true-to-life story of being born with a congenital heart defect, which nearly took his life numerous times. Cardall received a heart transplant 10 years ago and continues to thrive as a father, husband, and artist. The Broken Miracle will also be released as a biographical fiction novel written by J.D. Netto. The book will be released February 2.",

      "description": "After being raised by an orthodox Mormon mother and a \u0022redneck, somewhat Jack Mormon Pioneer stock dad,\u0022 Gretchen Day decided that she was going to be an \u0022all in\u0022 Mormon mother.\u00A0 After getting engaged at age 19 (as a BYU Freshman), Gretchen went on to get married in the LDS temple, and to fulfill many of the stereotypes of a Utah County Ultra-Orthodox Mormon mother, including:\n  Having 8 children. Homeschooling her children using Book of Mormon-based curriculum. Raising her children with little to no media. Imposing strict \u0022modesty\u0022 guidelines on her children (mostly her daughters). Doing at least one underwater home birth. Pursuing strict dietary practices (\u0022perfect eating) such as restricting sugar, eating only raw, vegan foods, etc.  Over time, Gretchen\u0027s ultra-orthodox Mormon dream began to crumble in several different ways:\n  She began to experience serious depression. She started making serious life decisions based on \u0022spiritual experiences\u0022 based on feelings -- that may not have been very healthy for her (in hindsight). Some of her children started to lose their testimonies of the church. She had a son who became seriously depressed and ultimately suicidal, based in part on inhumane \u0022worthiness\u0022 interviews conducted by well-intentioned bishops, mission, and stake presidents - who were/are operating within an abusive system.\u00A0 This included feeling pressure to lie about his faith crisis to his home ward and BYU bishop, in order to keep his place at BYU and to stay in good standing with the church. She began learning about factual Mormon church history (e.g., polygamy, Book of Mormon problems), which became deeply triggering for her.  As Gretchen\u0027s faith began to crumble, she started to feel trapped within the Utah County Mormon bubble.\n  Should she lie to her son about her faith journey, as he was preparing to leave on his mission, or should she be honest with him and risk spoiling his experience? Was she trapped in a \u0022Mormon mafia\u0022 of sorts, with no escape? Should she \u0022come out\u0022 to fellow ward members and leadership, and risk social ostracization? Or should she quietly \u0022fade away\u0022 from church activity to avoid any conflict?  In Gretchen\u0027s case, she decided to leave the church in a very vocal fashion.\u00A0 This has included:\n  Writing a letter/email ward members to explain why she was leaving the church. Inviting her bishopric to attend a \u0022Resignation Speech\u0022 that she offered to them, primarily with the intent of recovering her lost voice as a Mormon woman, and speaking her truth. Diving deeply into the \u0022cult\u0022 and \u0022unethical persuasion\u0022 literature, Creating a web site to share her story and perspectives with the world. Authoring a series of children\u0027s books to help parents educate their children about how to avoid falling prey to undue influence of any sort.  If you are seeking a powerful, inspiring story of one ultra-orthodox Utah county Mother\u0027s journey out of Mormonism, this is it.\u00A0 If you enjoyed the interviews of folks like Donna Showalter, Leah Young, you will deeply treasure this interview (but only after it breaks your heart).",

Didn\u0027t rational people hash this all out in the Enlightenment? John Hamer believes that the majority of Christians including many intellectual leaders of the movement took a wrong turn centuries ago and with negative consequences for the whole path of Western civilization today. He proposes going back and exploring an alternative path, including opening up the term \u0022God\u0022 as a variable in need of undefinition and reexamination.

      "description": "Join me today for one of my favorite Mormon Stories Podcast interviews/interviewees of all time. In today\u0027s episode, Stanford University graduate student Amy McPhie Allebest returns to discuss the development of patriarchy within human civilization, with a specific focus on the religious context. She also announces her new podcast entitled \u0022Breaking Down Patriarchy - An Essential Texts Book Club.\u0022\n Patriarchy has incredibly deep roots in the human condition, and harms everyone - especially women, but also men, youth, and children. This episode is for ALL of us, and you will not be disappointed with Amy\u0027s incredible knowledge, insight, and compassion.\n The Oxford Dictionary defines patriarchy as \u0022a system of society or government in which men hold the power and women are largely excluded from it.\u0022 All cultures all over the world practice patriarchy, sometimes violently, sometimes seemingly benevolently, sometimes in ways we are so accustomed to that we don\u0027t even notice. But when was patriarchy instituted? How? Why? Who has challenged this system, and how have their critiques changed the world?\n Breaking Down Patriarchy: An Essential Texts Book Club answers these questions, as well as addressing the very personal ways that patriarchy impacts our lives and relationships. Every week, an intelligent, insightful, relatable guest joins host Amy McPhie Allebest to read and discuss a historical text. Listeners are invited to read the book ahead of time, but even if they are not able to read, Amy and her reading partners provide a thorough \u0022breakdown\u0022 of the issues and powerful, practical takeaways that benefit the real lives of women - and men! - everywhere.\n Check out the introductory episode to hear about the reading list, and the egalitarian vision that aims to foster the flourishing of all human beings, including boys and men.\n Amy\u0027s Bio: I grew up in Colorado as the oldest of 5 children, reading, writing, drawing, singing, and practicing the piano and violin. I attended Brigham Young University, where I met Erik Allebest during my first week of freshman year, studied abroad in Israel, lived in Chile for a year and a half as a missionary, and married Erik all before graduating with a degree in English. Erik and I moved around - to Colorado, Southern California, Utah, Spain, and Northern California - while Erik started and ran chess businesses for a living (primarily chess.com) and I stayed home to raise our four children. Those four kids have become brilliant, hilarious people and are our very best friends. I am a long-time trail runner, a recent CrossFitter, a lifelong reader and writer, and an almost-graduate of Stanford University\u0027s Master\u0027s of Liberal Arts program.\n Web Site Link: www.breakingdownpatriarchy.com\n Facebook Page: facebook.com/breakingdownpatriarchy\n Instagram: @bdownpatriarchy\n Twitter: @bdownpatriarchy #patriarchy #feminism #mormon",

      "description": "In my opinion, one of the most damaging books ever published by the Mormon Church is Spencer W. Kimball\u2019s \u201CThe Miracle of Forgiveness.\u201D Among other things, this book teaches that:\n  No young Mormon man or woman is worthy to go on a mission if they masturbate. Masturbation alone leads to masturbation with others, which leads to \u201Chomosexuality.\u201D Being gay or lesbian is \u201Cugly,\u201D \u201Crepugnant,\u201D and comparable to a disease. \u201CHomosexuality\u201D leads to bestiality. \u201CHomosexuality\u201D can be easily \u201Ccured.\u201D People who have pre-marital sex, and even rape victims, are \u201Cblighted\u201D and \u201Cscarred.\u201D It is far better to die than to lose one\u2019s \u201Cvirtue.\u201D Death by suicide is a sign of foolishness, faithlessness and/or weakness and/or sin.  To be clear, this book is currently sold at Deseret Book, and remains on the book shelves of hundreds of thousands of Mormons across the world.\n In this short presentation, I offer my brief argument for why I believe that \u201CThe Miracle of Forgiveness\u201D should be removed from Deseret Book, and I let listeners and viewers know what they can do to help. I also share my thoughts on what the Mormon Church can do to help \u201Catone\u201D for selling this damaging book for several decades.\n How You Can Help:\n  Share this Presentation. Email Deseret Book:  service@deseretbook.com mediainquiry@deseretbook.com hrdept@deseretbook.com   Call Deseret Book  1-800-453-4532 (Toll-Free US and Canada) 1-801-517-3369 (International)   Speak to any influencers you know. Do what you can to remove this book from the access of people who might be vulnerable (book shelves, etc.). Please share with me/us what you did, and the reactions. Remember the date: 1/18/2021. Monitor deseretbook.com for when they take the book down. I will throw a party when it\u2019s gone (likely this summer post-COVID)  P.S. This is a re-recording to make the video less \u201Cranty,\u201D and to remove the discussion of book bans and book burnings, which is not useful. HUGE thanks to everyone who gave feedback on this. I always want to be a constructive voice.",

      "description": "In a recent video released by paid actors supported by FAIRMormon and the More Good Foundation, Kwaku El, Brad Witbeck, and Cardon Ellis make the claim that I and Mormon Stories (and Jeremy Runnells) are intentionally \u0022homewrecking for profit\u0022 with the work we do.\n In an attempt to combat this hurtful claim, I reached out to our amazing Mormon Stories Listeners, requesting your help by sharing if/how Mormon Stories Podcast has helped your family. I have been deeply honored and humbled by the overwhelming support we have received, and would like to personally thank each one of you that were brave enough to share your own \u201CMormon Story\u201D with me.\n Mormon Stories podcast seeks to understand, explore, challenge, and improve the Mormon experience through stories, and has never had the intention of harming families in any way. In fact, we strive to support and mend family relationships by promoting healthy communication skills and unconditional love.\n The primary objectives of Mormon Stories podcast include:\n  Providing support to Mormons who are transitioning away from either orthodox Mormonism, or from Mormonism altogether, with a particular emphasis on:   Minimizing the anxiety, depression, and occasional suicidality that can accompany a transition away from religious orthodoxy. Reducing the number of unnecessary divorces attributable to Mormon faith crises. Creating a community of support for liberal/progressive and post-Mormons.   Building greater awareness regarding accurate LDS/Mormon church history, doctrine, and theology \u2013 so that both active, believing Mormons and investigators of the church can make informed decisions regarding their investment in, and engagement with the church. Identifying opportunities for growth/improvement within the LDS church, and within broader Mormon culture.  Mormon Stories Podcast by no means benefits from the destruction of families, and we are saddened to see our community mis-represented in this way. It is my hope that the personal accounts represented in this video will be evidence of how Mormon Stories has actually benefited the lives of our listeners, and lay to rest the claim that Jeremy Runnells and myself have ever participated in \u201Chomewrecking for profit.\u201D\n Thank you.",

      "description": "Zelph on the Shelf is one of the most successful YouTube channels in history dedicated to exploring Mormonism in thoughtful and entertaining ways.\n \u00A0\n Five years ago I sat down with Samantha Shelley and Tanner Gilliland to discuss their loss of faith as \u0022Mormon Millennials.\u0022 That episode was extremely well-received at the time, and was highly influential in the journey of tens of thousands of Mormons, including Tyler Glenn (lead singer of Neon Trees).\n Today\u0027s episode with Tanner and Samantha will be in two parts:\n Part 1: Samantha and Tanner discuss the evolution and impact of Zelph on the Shelf over the past 5 years.\n Part 2 (My favorite part): Samantha and Tanner discuss how they have healed and grown over the past 5 years in many of the domains most salient to transitioning Mormons, including: creativity, community, identity, mental health, spirituality, sexuality, finding meaning/purpose in their lives, and in thoughts about death and the afterlife.\n Part 3: We end this interview by discussing Tanner and Samantha\u0027s perspective on the recent Mormon apologetic content released by FAIRMormon, featuring controversial apologist Kwaku El.\n I found Samantha and Tanner to be incredibly thoughtful and wise, and am confident that you will thoroughly enjoy this episode.",

      "description": "Recently, the Mormon apologetic organization FAIRMormon has released several aggressive new videos via their YouTube Channel starring the actors Kwaku El, Cardon Ellis, and Brad Witbeck. These videos are intended to appeal to younger Latter-day saints, but also launch aggressive attacks against me (John Dehlin) and Jeremy Runnells (author of the CES Letter). The historical accuracy/honesty of these videos has also been called into question by many.\n Today we interview Anthony D. Miller - a wise and thoughtful post-Mormon - about these latest events. Some of the topics we hope to cover are listed below. We would also welcome your questions/comments.\n Topics for today:\n  Motivations behind Mormon apologetics. Differences between Mormon apologetics and critical scholarship Contrast traditional apologetics and more progressive, nuanced apologetics Examples of people who have shifted from apologetics towards critical scholarship, and their explanations as to \u201Cthe why.\u201D Examples of people who engage with critical scholarship, but operate within Mormonism with a mostly a metaphorical paradigm with an apologetic bent. Contrast how GenZ, Millennials, GenX, and Baby Boomers engage with information. How GenZ at times experiences fragility, catastrophizing, call-out culture, and perception of violence in speech, and how these things affect engagement with apologetics and scholarship. (Jonathan Haidt\u2019s book, The Coddling of the American Mind). Current spectrum of apologetics Approaches and methods for distribution  Firesides and conferences Radical Orthodoxy proclamation, Deznat, etc. Adaptations to respond to social media, YouTube, TikTok   What we might expect going forward Will this approach work? Will it backfire? Is it ethical?",

Dre shares how she almost lost her mother to death by suicide, in part due to pressures of \u0022perfectionism\u0022 that many Mormon women experience.

Feel free to include what role (if any) the LDS Church, and/or apologetic sites like FAIRMormon played in promoting family health and unity, or in harming your family. Please email your videos to me here: mormonstories@gmail.com, or you can message them to me on Facebook. Or if you prefer to write your story, please do so in the comments below. Please know that these videos and/or this text could be used publicly.

      "description": "Paul Cardall battled long odds from birth, eventually triumphing over a serious heart disability to earn distinction as an outstanding composer and pianist. In 1997 he first won widespread notice by setting author Richard Paul Evans\u2019 No. 1 NY Times best-seller The Christmas Box to music. Cardall\u2019s achievements range from releasing 11 chart-topping albums, winning the Gospel Music Association Dove Award for Instrumental Album of the Year, collaborating with Grammy-winning singer CeCe Winans, Audrey Assad, The Piano Guys among other distinguished artists.\n With over 2 billion streams, Cardall is one of the most listened to Steinway \u0026 Sons sponsored artist in music business. His entrepreneurial activities include founding and directing the Stone Angel Music label and recording studio, promoting medical research and providing scholarships for congenital heart disease through his foundation. Cardall\u2019s music has included works for piano, vocal, band and orchestral settings. On his latest album, Peaceful Piano, he returns to his solo performance roots while exploring complete real-time improvisation for the first time.\n Paul\u0027s Mormon story includes:\n  Growing up in Salt Lake City, Utah, learning to \u0022fit in\u0022 as a child and youth with a heart condition. Serving an LDS mission, and marrying in an LDS temple. Paul\u0027s rise to celebrity as a piano performer - first in Salt Lake City, then joining the LDS Church speaking/inspiration circuit, and ultimately becoming a world-renowned musician, with hundreds of millions of Spotify downloads. Paul\u0027s receipt of a human heart transplant, and his recovery. Paul\u0027s struggles to maintain a healthy/happy marriage, ultimately leading to his disfellowshipment from the LDS Church and a shaming public divorce. Paul\u0027s remarriage to a non-LDS woman, and his invitation to co-author a Mormon hymn with LDS Church apostle David A. Bednar called \u0022One by One.\u0022 Paul\u0027s loss of testimony in the LDS Church, and his discovery of a new faith in traditional, non-denominational Christianity.  Cardall\u2019s story is continuing to evolve as an artist, author and humanitarian. His upcoming album The Broken Miracle, which will be available for pre-order this December, was inspired by J.D. Netto\u2019s biographical fictional novel, based on real events in the artists life from being born with only half a heart, enduring a series of surgeries, which culminated in a heart transplant. While waiting for a donor heart, the pianist\u2019s brother was tragically killed. The album will feature several award-winning guests including David Archuleta, Ty Herndon, Thompson Square, Neon Tress\u2019 Tyler Glenn and more.\n We hope you enjoy this episode!\u00A0 Paul is a fantastic human.",

This essay was groundbreaking in that it officially renounced past LDS racist teachings regarding blacks and the LDS Priesthood. This essay has been highly controversial. Some see it as groundbreaking positive progress. Some see it as deceptive and/or inadequate. Others lost their faith in the LDS Church because of it.\n Today on Mormon Stories Podcast we interview Dr. Matt Harris who recently published an analysis of the Race and Priesthood essay. Matt\u0027s essay is entitled \u0022Whiteness Theology and the Evolution of Mormon Racial Teachings.\u0022 This essay is contained within the newly released book entitled \u0022The LDS Gospel Topics Series: A Scholarly Engagement\u0022 published by Signature Books (edited by Matt Harris and Newell G. Bringhurst).\n Click here to purchase this very important book: https://www.amazon.com/LDS-Gospel-Topics-Scholarly-Engagement/dp/1560852879",

      "description": "In today\u0027s Mormon Stories Podcast episode legendary Utah journalist and investigator Lynn Packer discusses his recent investigation into possible fraud perpetrated by Utah Mormon Tim Ballard and Utah Mormon Attorney General Sean Reyes - as part of Operation Underground Railroad (OUR), which has raised over $30 million claiming to rescue children from sex trafficking.\n Packer has raised concerns about Tim Ballard and Sean Reyes being involved in the following:\n - Stockpiling $30M in donations that are not being used to save children.\n - Excessive compensation to Tim Ballard (over $300k/year). - Unethical accounting that now is likely hiding Tim Ballard\u0027s total compensation.\n - Lavish expenditures (e.g., first class flights, 5 star hotels, dramatic helicopter appearances) with no financial accountability about how funds are used.\n - Using false statistics to over-state the prevalence of child sex trafficking worldwide to lure donors.\n - Using excessive emotion and religious manipulation to lure donors, including claims to be called of God, and to be protected by God in OUR\u0027s work.\n - Using affinity with Mormon celebrities like Mormon apostle M. Russell Ballard, Glenn Beck, and Elizabeth/Ed Smart to lure donors.\n - Claiming credit for raids that they were not involved with. - Engaging in illegal and unsafe raids (jump teams) that often yield no positive results.\n - Alleged unsavory behavior of jump team members, including illegal drug use during raids, sexual assault, etc.\n - Drawing money and attention away from legitimate charities who are meaningfully providing solutions to the problems OUR decries.\n - Victimizing and politicizing the suffering of children for political gain (Sean Reyes).\n - Associating with and taking advantage of known false conspiracy theories like QAnon.\n - Using the LDS Church\u0027s law firm (Kirton \u0026 McConkie) to intimidate and silence whistleblowers.\n - In summary, manipulating wealthy donors through religious and patriotic emotion and misusing or misallocating funds, all on the backs of a very vulnerable population.\n Lynn Packer is best know for accurately exposing Mormon General Authority Paul H. Dunn for lying to Mormon church members about made-up World War II heroics and about playing professional baseball, all of which led to Elder Dunn being prematurely fired as a General Authority (and which the Mormon church tried to cover up through intimidation).\n Please join us if you have comments or questions for Lynn.\n NOTE: This podcast is not asserting that any of these allegations are true. Only that Lynn is claiming to have gathered evidence in support of these positions.",

      "description": "Paul H. Dunn is one of the most beloved General Authorities in the history of the Mormon church. His vast popularity was based on his uncanny ability to tell gripping stories in General Conference, in firesides, in over a dozen books, and on cassette tapes about his time as a professional baseball player with the St. Louis Cardinals, and about his career as a combat veteran in World War II.\n The only problems were:\n 1) Paul Dunn made up these stories. They were literally untrue.\n 2) Paul Dunn made a great deal of money, and drew his fame from these false stories.\n 3) Paul Dunn used his fame/reputation to advance fraudulent business schemes.\n Even more disturbing, however, were the lengths and breadths that the Mormon church went to, to suppress, cover-up, and kill this story - using its vast financial and legal resources.\n This story only came to light because of one courageous Mormon journalist - Lynn Kenneth Packer - who coincidentally was the nephew of super powerful/influential Mormon apostle Boyd K. Packer.\n In the end, Lynn Packer was fired from his job as a BYU professor for his involvement in investigating and breaking the Paul H. Dunn story. And while this story was minimally covered in an Arizona newspaper and in Sunstone magazine at the time, TO THIS DAY Lynn Packer has never been granted an extensive media interview to tell this story.\n Until today that is.",

Phillips penned a courageous, thoughtful response to this letter, which can be accessed here.\n Today we interview the two founders of the \u0022Project Rainbow\u0022 initiative in the Autumn Ridge section of Sandy, Utah: Kristy and Willy Donahoo.\u00A0\u00A0We also interview Cynthia Phillips, who is an active, believing member of her local LDS ward, and who fervently supports this initiative.\n Our goals with this episode are:\n  To spotlight good people doing good things. To inspire YOU to sponsor a Project Rainbow initiative in your neighborhood.\u00A0 Our hope is to turn Utah, Idaho, and Arizona RAINBOW-COLORED!  Please join us with your comments and questions!\n Bios:\n  Kristy Donahoo is a financial advisor and partner with Ray LeVitre, CFP\u2122.

      "description": "Katie Harmon was raised Catholic in Laramie, Wyoming. After falling in love with a Mormon boy at age 15, Katie became socially/emotionally converted to the LDS Church in spite of...\n  High ambitions for herself (Katie was a 4.0 student, got a 33 on her ACT, was in AP classes, got a full ride scholarship to the University of Wyoming, and wanted to become a doctor) and Strongly valuing social justice (e.g., anti-homophobia, anti-sexism, anti-racism).  As Katie became fully committed to the Mormon church, she saw her original aspirations slowly slip away, as she began to follow \u0022the Mormon way for women.\u0022 Katie ended up:\n  Experiencing severe Scrupulosity as a Mormon woman. Enduring an invasive and inappropriate \u0022sexual repentance\u0022 process. Marrying 3 months after graduating high school to a man she had only known 7 months. Getting sealed to her husband while her non-LDS family sat outside the Mormon temple. Having three children within a short period of time before she felt ready to do so, based on LDS teachings. Feeling frustrated when, after her 2nd child was diagnosed with major health issues at 20 weeks, priesthood blessings failed to heal her ailing child. She basically discovered after conversion that the \u0022Priesthood power\u0022 was not real, and did not work. Confronting the stifling \u0022ableism\u0022 of Mormon doctrine, theology, and culture.  As Katie\u0027s hopes and dreams began to fall apart, she began studying Mormonism more closely, and discovered that she was not taught as an investigator important truths about Mormon history and the LDS church that would likely have prevented her from joining.\n Katie\u0027s motivation for doing this interview is to call on the LDS Church to be fully honest in its missionary efforts, and in its education of children and youth, so that people like her can not be misled into joining and/or committing their lives to the Mormon church without being fully informed about its history, doctrine, and theology.",

Is it possible to reconcile religious belief with a natural, scientific view of the universe?\n Many people see secular and religious views as incompatible. They seem to believe it necessary to suspend disbelief and accept superstition in order to be religious, or that religion is an obstacle to productive engagement with the world. Even many of us who still profess some level of religiosity will admit that religion sometimes makes productive engagement more difficult and is sometimes less effective than it could be. For those who believe in prophecies of the eventual redemption of humanity, is it possible to work toward a vision of the future that is understood only vaguely, if at all? What is the effect of faith that is not active? Might active faith in Mormon (and other religious) visions of the future be essential to realizing them?\n Today we\u0027ll be talking with Carl Youngblood about his life as a Mormon and a transhumanist, what that word even means, and how his struggle to apply his faith meaningfully in our rapidly changing world has led him to co-found the Mormon Transhumanist Association, where he currently serves as a member of the board of Directors. Carl looks forward to sharing his ideas and answering your questions about his life and faith.",

      "description": "As part of our ongoing series on 21st century Mormonism outside of the United States, today we interview Douglas Stilgoe. Douglas is a 23 year old, 3rd generation Mormon raised in Warwickshire, England (Coventry England Stake).\n \n  \u00A0\n Douglas\u0027 story is interesting for many reasons:\n \n   He discusses life as a Mormon in the UK in the 2000\u0027s. He was raised in the same area as Tom Phillips, the high-ranking Mormon church leader in the U.K. who lost his faith and left the church AFTER receiving his 2nd anointing. His story explores how painful and damaging Mormonism can be on families when a parent loses their faith. He discusses his own very recent loss of faith as a young adult in the U.K., after being a very devout believing youth (just over the past year).  \n  \u00A0\n  For more information on Tom Phillips and the 2nd Anointing,  see here.",

      "description": "Karen Adam was raised in a same-sex household in Scotland (her mother identified as Lesbian). She joined the Mormon church at age 17 in 1992 after a teenage pregnancy. Karen lived as a member of the LDS Church in Scotland for almost 20 years - maturing from a young teenage mother to serving as LDS Sunday School teacher, Young Women\u2019s President, Compassionate Service Leader, Relief Society Teacher, Primary Presidency, etc.\n \n   \u00A0\n \n   Karen was married and sealed for eternity in an LDS temple, and for years helped raise six children, living a very traditional LDS family life.\n \n   \u00A0\n \n   When Karen\u2019s marriage fell apart she found solace in serving the wider community in Scotland outside the confines of her Scottish Mormon ward. This led on to a political awakening, and ultimately to her leaving the LDS church, and running for political office in Scotland.\n \n   \u00A0\n \n   Topics covered in this episode include:\n \n    Converting to the LDS Church in Scotland, Teenage pregnancy. Being a devout Mormon in Scotland. Navigating an abusive marriage that included drug addiction. Navigating divorce and remarriage within the Mormon church in Scotland. Dealing with harmful messages and policies regarding female sexuality as a Mormon Scott, including damaging bishop interviews. Responding to the Mormon church\u0027s harmful LGBTQ policies as a Mormon Scott having been raised in a same-sex household. Experiencing a Mormon faith crisis in Scotland. Rebuilding life as a post-Mormon divorced Scottish mother. Throwing her hat into the political ring in mid-life as a Scottish ex-Mormon woman.  \n  This is Karen\u0027s story.",

      "description": "As many of you will recall, Shannon Caldwell Montez joined us on Mormon Stories Podcast in July, 2020 to tell us her own story, as well as to tell us the story of B.H. Roberts - the LDS Church historian  and General Authority who was tasked to answer problems about Book of Mormon historicity, only to lose his testimony of the Book of Mormon as a historical document.\n During the B.H. Roberts episode we learned about a series of all-day meetings B.H. Roberts had in January, 1922 with the LDS Church First Presidency, Quorum of 12 Apostles, and the Quorum of 70 to discuss these Book of Mormon problems in-depth. Ultimately, Shannon shows in her thesis that the LDS church leadership was both unprepared and unwilling to address the problems Roberts presented - resulting in much disappointment and frustration for Roberts.\n In this follow-up interview with Shannon, we review evidence addressing the question as to whether or not Mormon General Authority and church historian B.H. Roberts lost his testimony of the Book of Mormon as a historical document.\n Resources Mentioned in the Podcast Include:\n  Shannon\u0027s Thesis: The Secret Mormon Meetings of 1922 B.H.

Wayment -- as together they discovered literally hundreds of instances where Joseph Smith plagiarized portions of the Joseph Smith \u0022Translation\u0022 of the Bible directly from Adam Clarke\u0027s Bible Commentary.\n Today\u0027s story includes:\n  Haley\u0027s early years growing up as a highly devout Mormon girl and young woman who struggled significantly with undiagnosed religious anxiety (possibly scrupulosity). Haley\u0027s LDS mission to Panama. Haley\u0027s discovery of Joseph Smith\u0027s plagiarism, as she was working as a BYU undergraduate research assistant under Dr. Thomas A. Wayment. Haley\u0027s deep struggle with her Mormon faith once she began studying the authenticity of Mormon scripture and other truth claims. Haley\u0027s troubling brush with the BYU Honor Code Office, which almost resulted in her being expelled from BYU. How Haley\u0027s name was almost removed from the publishing of her research with Dr. Wayment. A review of Haley\u0027s current views on LDS Church truth claims.  As a part of this interview, we will be discussing in-depth the article/chapter \u0022A Recently Recovered Source: The Use of Adam Clarke\u2019s Bible Commentary in Joseph Smith\u2019s Bible Translation\u0022 that she co-authored with Thomas A. Wayment, which recently appeared in the newly released book \u0022Producing Ancient Scripture: Joseph Smith\u0027s Translation Projects in the Development of Mormon Christianity,\u0022 edited by Michael MacKay, Mark Ashurst-McGee, and Brian M. Hauglid.",

      "description": "When someone loses their faith in Mormonism, there are several paths\u00A0 often followed.\u00A0 One is to become agnostic or atheist, and never to rejoin a religion again.\u00A0 One is to re-join a Christian church.\u00A0 One is to follow a more fundamentalist Mormon path (e.g. Denver Snuffer, Preppers, Julie Rowe).\u00A0 And one is to become susceptible to new age beliefs and other gurus or cult leaders.\u00A0 Today we will be talking about the last option.\n Teal Swan (born Mary Teal Bosworth) is described on her web site as an American spiritual teacher, author, and social media personality.\u00A0 She was raised in Logan, UT, and as a teenager was connected to controversial Mormon therapist Barbara Snow, who was at the center of the Satanic Ritual Abuse panic in the 1990s and 2000s.\u00A0 After a very turbulent childhood, which involved self harm and suicidality, Teal pursued modeling for a time, and eventually began pursuing the path of becoming a spiritual guide.\n Teal\u0027s teachings on how to manage mental health issues have often been described as unconventional and she has received criticism for how she attracts fans, with some critics nicknaming her \u0022The Suicide Catalyst\u0022.\u00A0 At present she has 700,000 followers and has been covered by the BBC, and in several documentaries, including a recent documentary on Netflix.\n Her history of work is highly controversial because it incorporates various super controversial and problematic ideologies and practices such as:\n  The cultivation of repressed/recovered (false) memories. Claims of Satanic ritual abuse. Energy healing. Clairvoyance. Numerology. The Law of Attraction. A belief in a \u0022Third Eye.\u0022 The usage of crystals to \u0022raise your vibration or frequency.\u0022 A belief in multiple lives. A belief that she is an alien from another planet. A belief in spiritual projections/possessions. When dealing with suicidal clients, referring to suicide as \u0022pushing the reset button\u0022 for a future life. Communal living.  Jared Dobson was raised LDS, served an LDS mission, got married and divorced, became suicidal, and started searching for answers in New Age Spirituality.\u00A0 He came across Teal Swan, and became a follower in her movement (a \u0022Tealer\u0022) for 2 years.\u00A0 He ended up moving in with Teal and became a part of her communal family in Park City, Utah.\u00A0 They were romantically involved for 5-6 months, were set to have a child together, and as the relationship began to fray, Jared was kicked out of the commune and checked himself into a psychiatric ward (UNI at the University of Utah).\n He has been recovering ever since.\n This is Jared\u0027s story of his experiences with Teal Swan.\u00A0 This story also has important connections to other cult-like phenomena occurring in recent times, including the Lori Vallow/Chad Daybell/Julie Rowe/Prepper phenomena.\u00A0 It also is an insider\u0027s view into the emergence of a modern cult.",

Claims of Satanic ritual abuse. Energy healing. Clairvoyance. Numerology. The Law of Attraction. A belief in a \u0022Third Eye.\u0022 The usage of crystals to \u0022raise your vibration or frequency.\u0022 A belief in multiple lives. A belief that she is an alien from another planet.

As summarized by actor Will Smith, \u201CRacism isn\u2019t getting worse. It\u2019s getting filmed.\u201D\n These killings have led to numerous public protests throughout the United States, including this past weekend in Salt Lake City.

      "description": "Given the high demand for coaching support right now and the cash crunch being felt by everyone, I am putting together two weekly online Mormon faith transition support groups: one for individuals, and one for couples. I am limiting the individual group to 8 people, and the couples group to 4 couples. There are three main benefits to support groups: 1) They are more effective, mostly because you get input/support/ideas/motivation from an entire group. 2) They last longer (1.5 hours/week instead of 1 hour/week). 3) They are cheaper.  Topics for these groups will include: - Navigating a faith crisis. - Navigating relationships with believing family and friends. - Improving mental health. - Improving marriage/relationships. - Parenting. - Building a new, healthy life after a faith crisis. - Whatever else folks want/need. I have a Ph.D. in clinical and counseling psychology with 6 years of training in group therapy - and will be moderating these support groups. Margi may join us from time to time, depending on topic. You will sign up for an automatic, weekly payment. The cost is $40/week/individual, and $80/week/couple. We will establish a regular meeting day/time once the group is filled. We will meet online, viz Zoom. This is the registration page for the individual group. https://donorbox.org/mormonfaithtransitiongroup If you know anyone who might benefit from this group, please spread the word. Email for any questions at: drjohndehlin@gmail.com",

Holly\u0027s closeted feminism as a Mormon youth and adult. Holly and Ryan learning to listen to their own inner voices, which also involved navigating a religious faith crisis. Navigating BYU-Idaho while one is full time faculty, and in a mixed-faith marriage.

An insider\u2019s view of BYU-Idaho administration, including difficulties dealing with BYU-Idaho executives related to Title IX issues (e.g., sexual misconduct of Mormon ecclesiastical leaders towards BYU-Idaho students and faculty). Navigating and healing from religion-based depression, including suicidality. Deconstructing Mormon literalism and reconstructing a nuanced worldview. Learning to choose love over ideas.  Additional Resources mentioned in the episodes:\n  Ryan\u0027s AMAZING faith crisis/transition Reading/Podcast list can be found here, and has also been included below, after the video and audio links.\u00A0 This is probably the most impressive and thoughtful resources list I\u0027ve ever seen for Mormon/religious faith transitions. Holly\u0027s Art:  https://www.artbyholly.com/abstract.html \u00A0-- This link goes straight to the art Holly has done related to her faith transition, and her reclamation of motherhood. Ryan\u0027s Music:  http://www.ryannielsenmusic.com/music -- This link goes straight to the music portion of Ryan\u0027s website. Several pieces there are related to my faith transition, including \u0022Prayer for Peace\u0022 and \u0022Requiem.\u0022 Support Ryan!\u00A0 Ryan has written a 9 movement suite that explores his experience of a faith crisis, through the lens of the life of Elijah Abel.\u00A0 It\u0027s time to get this recorded.

Not flawless\u2026.not perfect\u2026..just thriving. When I say thriving, I mean overall healthier and happier than when you were active in the church.\n HOW: I have put together 20 questions for THRIVING post-Mormons and progressive Mormons to reflect upon, and to answer. I have had numerous people tell me that the simple process of reflecting upon and answering these questions has been deeply therapeutic for them. Some have even wept joyful or grief-filled tears as they\u2019ve gone through the process of answering the questions.\n I hope to release at least a few profiles a week over the next 6-12 months.\n Candidates for future Mormon Stories Podcast episodes will be culled from these profiles.\n I hope to include these profiles in an upcoming book that I hope to write entitled: THRIVING: The Gift of the Mormon Faith Crisis.\n Please submit your questions/answers if you are able/willing to do so!!!! I know that this project is going to help many people.",

Today\u2019s interview is no exception to this rule.\n Today on Mormon Stories podcast I am interviewing Kalin Orgill Organ. Aside from Kalin being a super thoughtful and courageous human, Kalin\u2019s story includes several important themes in modern Mormonism:\n  Kalin was raised in an orthodox Mormon home in California and in Highland, Utah \u2013 with seven siblings. She was sexually abused as a child, which possibly awakened her to her own sexuality early than other children. She began masturbating as a girl, before she even knew what the term meant.\u00A0 This instigated a multi-year effort between herself, her parents, and her Mormon bishop to try to stop the behavior, and to become \u201Cworthy\u201D in God\u2019s eyes. Kalin \u201Clost her virginity\u201D as a Mormon teen, which, along with her inability to stop masturbating, only made her feel less worthy. Kalin had doubts/questions as a Mormon teen, and even listened briefly to Mormon Stories podcast PRIOR to serving her mission.\u00A0 She fought hard to gain a testimony while on her mission. Over time, three of Kalin\u2019s siblings came out to her as LGBTQ, which multiplied her confusion and doubt. After returning from a successful Mormon mission, Kalin married her husband Aaron in a Mormon temple, wherein they became to onlookers the \u201Cperfect Mormon couple.\u201D Over time, after a lifetime of struggling to feel worthy, Kalin\u2019s doubts began to consume her, and she began to contemplate suicide as a Mormon wife and mother of two children. Kalin is currently navigating a mixed-faith marriage, and remains an active non-literal believer in her Salt Lake City ward.  This is Kalin\u2019s story \u2013 how she lost her orthodox Mormon faith, but found herself (and her own voice) in the process.\n You will not be disappointed with this interview. I hope you will join us. And please spread the word if you can!",

I am currently being flooded by parents and family members of Mormon missionaries, elderly senior missionaries, patriarchs, temple workers, workers at Deseret Industries, etc. about the Mormon church\u0027s tragically inadequate response to the COVID-19 / Coronavirus outbreak. It appears as though many church leaders, mission presidents, and missionaries are seeing the Corona virus pandemic as an opportunity to corner people in their homes, with hopes of spreading the gospel. It has also come to my attention that Mormon church patriarchs, temple workers (most of whom also fit into the high risk category), and workers at Deseret Industries are still being asked to travel from home to home to give patriarchal blessings, and/or to show up at the temples or at Deseret Industries to work.\n  Please spread the word so we can help the Mormon church keep its members safe.",

      "description": "I have SUPER good news for those of you who have always wanted to attend a Mormon Stories / Faith Crisis Retreat...I have a super cool opportunity.  A generous donor has stepped forward to underwrite the event, and a few other generous folks have offered their St. George homes to us...so here\u0027s the scoop!  1) We are able to make the 12/6-12/8 St. George retreat available to ANYONE who wants to attend. If you cannot afford the registration fee, you are free to pay what you can afford, and the generous donor will cover the rest.  2) We will be driving a retreat karaoke party van down from Salt Lake City on the morning of 12/6, returning the evening of 12/8....so if anyone wants to drive with us...have a blast...and save on transportation, we\u0027d love to have you!  3) Finally, we have several guest rooms available for folks to stay in if you need a place to stay in St. George. If you can pay something for them, great. If you are not able to afford them, that\u0027s ok too!  In summary, PLEASE don\u0027t let finances stop you from attending our Mormon Stories / faith crisis retreat if you are able to come. We will focus on all the important issues including:  1) Navigating a religious faith crisis. 2) Communicating with believing family and friends. 3) Navigating a mixed faith marriage. 4) Improving your mental health during a faith transition. 5) Improving your sexuality during and after a faith transition. 6) Parenting after a faith crisis.  And whatever else you want/need help on.  Please spread the word, and we hope to see many of you you soon!",

Anthony has presented at multiple Sunstone Symposium sessions in the past and at this Summer\u0027s Thrive Conference where he gave a presentation titled \u0022Growing Beyond Grief\u0022 which we hope to feature on a future episode of Mormon Stories / The Gift of the Mormon Faith Crisis.\u00A0Anthony has also given past interviews with Gina Colvin\u0027s\u00A0A Thoughtful Faith and appeared on multiple episodes with Bill Reel and Allan Mount (linked on Anthony\u0027s blog) unpacking the Gospel Topic Essays.\n On these episodes with Mormon Stories, we hope to dig deep into Anthony\u0027s personal Mormon story including:\n *What he calls his \u0022literal faith\u0022 in the truth claims of the Mormon Church, including using his patriarchal blessing as the literal guidebook for the choices and direction he pursed in life\n *How his faith began to unravel after he discovered the LDS-published\u00A0Gospel Topic Essays\n *How he sought community and healing during his faith crisis, including the founding of a Mormon Spectrum group\n *How he deconstructed his past beliefs and is reconstructing a sense of spirituality after his faith crisis\n ....and so much more.\n We hope our listeners will draw from Anthony\u0027s rich experience in learning to navigate a mixed faith marriage, communicating across faith and belief, reconstructing a sense of spirituality after a faith crisis, and creating support communities for people inside and outside the edge of Mormonism.",

His \u0022sins\u0022 included:\n \u00A0\n 1) Losing his Mormon faith after reading the Mormon church\u0027s own Gospel Topics essays, which discussed topics such as : a) discrepancies in the multiple accounts of Joseph Smith\u0027s first vision, b) Joseph Smith\u0027s polygamy and polyandry, c) concerns about the authenticity of the Book of Mormon and Book of Abraham, etc.\n \u00A0\n 2) Writing publicly about his loss of faith on Facebook, and\n \u00A0\n 3) Supporting Mormon Bishop Sam Young\u0027s efforts to protect Mormon children from sexual abuse.\n \u00A0\n During the disciplinary council Jared\u0027s Mormon Stake President read the charges of apostasy, including several of Jared\u0027s Facebook statements. Then, Jared\u0027s wife, Gwen, along with two of their daughters (Taylor and Madison) testified on Jared\u0027s behalf. Then Jared provided his own response to the charges.\n \u00A0\n At the close of the disciplinary council, Jared\u0027s stake president twice asked Jared explicitly if he would agree to stop commenting on social media about his disbelief in fundamental Mormon truth claims. Both times Jared told his stake president that he would NOT stop expressing his disbelief on social media - explicitly defying the counsel of Jared\u0027s priesthood leadership (which in and of itself is ground for apostasy).\n \u00A0\n In a somewhat unexpected and heretofore unheard of act in the modern area, Jared was informed by his Stake President that he has been Disfellowshipped for Apostasy.",

In this interview Amber shares her experience leaving her religion. From the book\u0027s abstract:\n \u0022Amber\u0027s loss of faith culminated in her own personal apocalypse, the only kind of ending possible for a Jehovah\u0027s Witness.\n \n Shunned by family and friends as an apostate, Amber was alone in Shanghai and thrown into a world she had only known from the periphery--with no education or support system. A coming of age story of a woman already in her thirties, this unforgettable memoir examines what it\u0027s like to start one\u0027s life over again with an entirely new identity. It follows Scorah to New York City, where a personal tragedy forces her to look for new ways to find meaning in the absence of religion. With compelling, spare prose, Leaving the Witness\u00A0traces the bittersweet process of starting over, when everything one\u0027s life was built around is gone.\u0022",

      "description": "Friends who are: 1) struggling with a Mormon faith crisis, 2) in a Mormon mixed-faith marriage, or 3) struggling with marriage/family issues relating to a Mormon faith crisis As my time is super limited (working on a book!), and my individual faith crisis coaching practice is filled to the brim, AND as I realize that for some people hourly coaching can be pricey - I would like to experiment with a format of doing faith crisis mini-workshops in the Utah/Idaho/Arizona/Colorado areas (or others if interested). This would allow me to support more people, and would allow people within a specific area to make friends and build deeper connections who are close by (thus fostering community). The format would be as follows: - Size of group: 10-12 people, couples and/or individuals welcome. - Date/Time: Any 6 hour block, weekday, weeknight, or weekend. - Possible Topics: Navigating a Mormon faith transition, tips for positive Mental Health, healthy marriages/relationships, communicating with believing family and friends, finding community and/or spirituality during and after a faith crisis, etc. (Basically whatever the group wants to cover) - Location: I could travel to where the group is, or we could find a central location. - Cost: $250/person (6 hours of coaching for around the cost of 1 hour of coaching). It would be particularly meaningful to target specific areas and bring people together who live close to each other (e.g., Alpine, S. Jordan, Provo, Orem, Logan, Ogden, Davis County, SLC, Boise, St. George, Cedar City, Spanish Fork, Park City, Heber/Midway, etc.) If any of you are interested in hosting/organizing such an event, please message me. I would love to support you in this way, and help build local friendships/community at the same time. Thanks in advance! John Dehlin, Ph.D.",

      "description": "On this edition of Mormon Stories Podcast, we are honored to interview award-winning documentary filmmaker Helen Whitney\u00A0about her life as a documentary filmmaker, her work on the 2007 PBS documentary \u0022The Mormons,\u0022\u00A0and her new film about mortality entitled \u0022Into the Night.\u0022\n In Part 1, we discover that throughout her career, she has maintained a deep interest in spiritual journeys, which she first explored with her documentary The Monastery, a 90-minute ABC special, about the oldest Trappist community in the Americas. Helen followed this film with a three-hour Frontline documentary for PBS, John Paul II: The Millennial Pope, and in 2007 she produced The Mormons, a four-hour PBS series that explored the richness, complexities and controversies surrounding the Mormon faith. Following the Sept. 11 attacks, she produced Faith and Doubt at Ground Zero, a two-hour documentary that examined how religious belief \u2013 and unbelief \u2013 of Americans was challenged and altered by the spiritual aftershocks of 9/11.\n In Part 2, Helen shares intimate details about the making of the highly-impactful documentary \u0022The Mormons.\u0022 She also provides her non-Mormon perspective of the faith and many anecdotal interactions with LDS General Authorities including Boyd K. Packer, Jeffrey R. Holland, and Gordon B.

      "description": "Join us for this important and time-sensitive edition of Mormon Stories Podcast as we interview Idahoan, Dusty Johns. In Part 1 of this interview,\u00A0Dusty shares his experience growing up as a gay and closeted Mormon and at times being the only active member of his family. Before becoming a missionary, he covenanted with God that if he served an honorable full-time mission that his sexual orientation would change. Upon returning from his mission to England and quickly marrying, a few months into his marriage he realized that he was unable to connect with his wife in a manner that a man and woman should. Though the marriage did not last, it did produce two boys who Dusty treasures and shares parenting responsibilities with their mother. Dusty began to be involved with LDS-affiliated groups that attempt to diminish \u0022same-sex attraction\u0022 and overcome homosexual behavior, but quickly saw that many program attendees were either acting hypocritically or living seemingly miserable lives as celibate Mormons. After experiencing medical complications that almost ended his life, his devotion to the LDS Church and God became cemented and he decided that he could be both an active Mormon, and create a family with someone that he truly loved.\n In Part 2 of this interview, we learn how Dusty met his husband and how the two have formed a loving family unit with Dusty\u0027s two boys. The family was quickly accepted by their local Idahoan ward, including their ward and stake leadership. Dusty tells us that recently his local leadership was directed by LDS Church authorities in Salt Lake City to initiate disciplinary proceedings because of his same-sex marriage. After receiving a letter in the mail indicating such, Dusty forwarded the letter to Mormon Stories Podcast and 6 hours after the letter was posted publicly, his stake leadership was asked to postpone the disciplinary council until after General Conference, as directed by the church\u0027s PR department. \u00A0As of today, Dusty\u0027s council meeting is now set to take place October 16th.",

      "description": "Today\u0027s release is the first in a new series devoted to interviewing prominent historians to gather their evidence-based take on the question, \u0022How did the Mormon Church come to be?\u0022\n Kathleen Melonakos\u0027s book Secret Combinations: Evidence of Early Mormon Counterfeiting 1800-1847\u00A0has created buzz in many online Mormon communities and we are excited to launch our series with Kathleen\u0027s expertise and careful research.\u00A0Her book chronicles the evidence that early Mormon leaders, starting with Joseph Smith Sr., dealt in counterfeit money beginning in Vermont, and continuing throughout Joseph and Hyrum\u0027s careers. It places the Smith brothers in the early American context where counterfeiting networks and some of their CEO-like bosses posed as preachers. It is the only book of its kind that uncovers the problems counterfeiters caused in early America and what really happened before, during and after the Book of Mormon appeared on the scene. Her book is both fact-based and fast moving, supported by more than 1400 footnotes and over 100 photos and illustrations. It is also based on nearly 10 years of research, conducted in Vermont, New York, Illinois, Missouri, and Utah.\n In this interview, Kathleen attempts to provide the historical context for the life of the Smith family and the founding of the LDS Church. In particular, we focus on the counterfeiting culture of the time period (Part 1), treasure digging as a practice (Part 2), the origins of the Book of Mormon (Part 3), and finally we delve into how her research and work influences Kathleen\u0027s personal beliefs (Part 4).",

      "description": "Today\u0027s release is the first in a new series devoted to interviewing prominent historians to gather their evidence-based take on the question, \u0022How did the Mormon Church come to be?\u0022\n Kathleen Melonakos\u0027s book Secret Combinations: Evidence of Early Mormon Counterfeiting 1800-1847\u00A0has created buzz in many online Mormon communities and we are excited to launch our series with Kathleen\u0027s expertise and careful research.\u00A0Her book chronicles the evidence that early Mormon leaders, starting with Joseph Smith Sr., dealt in counterfeit money beginning in Vermont, and continuing throughout Joseph and Hyrum\u0027s careers. It places the Smith brothers in the early American context where counterfeiting networks and some of their CEO-like bosses posed as preachers. It is the only book of its kind that uncovers the problems counterfeiters caused in early America and what really happened before, during and after the Book of Mormon appeared on the scene. Her book is both fact-based and fast moving, supported by more than 1400 footnotes and over 100 photos and illustrations. It is also based on nearly 10 years of research, conducted in Vermont, New York, Illinois, Missouri, and Utah.\n In this interview, Kathleen attempts to provide the historical context for the life of the Smith family and the founding of the LDS Church. In particular, we focus on the counterfeiting culture of the time period (Part 1), treasure digging as a practice (Part 2), the origins of the Book of Mormon (Part 3), and finally we delve into how her research and work influences Kathleen\u0027s personal beliefs (Part 4).",

As Jared progresses through life, he feels he has forgiven his uncle and was ready to move on, until his uncle was called as a bishop and given stewardship over a ward, including children. \u00A0Feeling pressure to say something, Jared finally told his wife Juli of the abuse he suffered decades earlier.\n In Part 2 of this interview, Jared and Juli discuss multiple meetings and interactions with LDS Church leaders including multiple stake presidents and bishops, and a private meeting with Elder Steven O. Laing of the Seventy (recorded by Jared and Juli and presented as Part 3 of this interview) to warn them of his uncle\u2019s alleged history of abuse. During this meeting, both Jared and Juli were still true believing members, but now regard the inaction taken by their priesthood leaders and instead focusing on their personal faith as a major tipping point for their testimonies.

Our first interview with Hans and Birgitta was released on July 22, 2013 and is noted as one of our most important releases given Hans\u0027 church leadership pedigree as a bishop and stake president in Sweden before serving in the LDS church 3rd Quorum of the Seventy from 2000-2005 in the Europe Central area under LDS Apostle L. Tom Perry, as well as the sincere struggles with testimony that both Hans and Birgitta faced after his release as an Area Authority.\n In this two-part interview, we relive both Hans and Birgitta\u0027s ascent through the LDS Church, we elaborate for the first time on Hans and Birgitta\u0027s experience receiving the Second Anointing (a rarely-talked about temple ordinance reserved for those in the upper echelons of the LDS Church and described in detail during our epic interview with Tom Phillips), and we discuss the motivations for writing the book, \u0022Truth Seeking: The Story of High-Ranking Mormon Leader Hans Mattsson Seeking Sincere Answers From His Church but Instead Finding Contempt, Fear, Doubt ...and Eventually Peace.\u0022",

      "description": "What would cause a sitting Mormon bishop and his wife to lose their testimonies while he is serving as bishop \u2013 leading him to resign as bishop?\u00A0Jeanne and Jason\u2019s story is another in a series of episodes where we interview past Mormon bishops.\n The two describe raising their four children in the church, their varied callings, and how inextricable Mormonism was in their marriage and worldview.\u00A0Jason\u2019s first call to a bishopric was not one he felt ready or spiritual enough for. Moved by the words of President Hinckley to  \u201CForget yourself and go to work,\u201D he accepted and immediately went to work. \u201CHe was a good bishop,\u201D affirms Jeanne.

Shawn is widely known for his bold and sometimes bare-knuckled approach when comparing Mormonism to Christianity, and given his reputation as an animated and articulate speaker, this interview will keep you entertained and perhaps inspired.\n In this interview we cover:\n  Part 1:\u00A0Shawn provides a brief recap of his born-again experience, and then discusses the meteoric rise, and ultimately descent of his tv program Heart of the Matterafter he confronted local Utah Christian churches for focusing more on programs and tithes, and less on the Bible. \u00A0According to Shawn, these churches were providing the same \u0022bondage\u0022 to people as the Mormon Church was. Part 2:\u00A0This segment of the interview is a conversation focusing on Shawn\u0027s theology and beliefs, and Shawn provides a pitch for why a questioning Mormon or post-Mormon should seek the Jesus of the Bible Part 3:\u00A0Shawn describes the \u0022bondage\u0022 he sees when local churches focus more on \u0022religion\u0022 and less on the teachings of Jesus. \u00A0After our\u00A0interview with the South Mountain Community Church\u00A0earlier this year, Shawn voiced concerns to Mormon Stories about our visit and in this segment, we engage in a respectful dialogue about churches such as SMCC and how they serve their congregants.",
