      "description": "In this episode, we have Isabella Flores joining us! She\u0027s well-known here in Austin, TX, especially after her very public breakup with the Raw Dog Run Club Owner. Isabella opens up about the reasons behind their split, the challenges they faced, and how she managed to navigate such a public breakup. We also explore her passion for traveling, trying new experiences, and, believe it or not, escaping a religious cult. Yes, you heard that right! This is one of the most fascinating episodes I\u0027ve ever done. Isabella\u0027s life story is so compelling that she should definitely consider writing a book about it. Tune in. Trust me, just trust me, you don\u2019t wanna miss this one!",
