We\u0027ll still be focused on the \u0022American Dream\u0022 and all the assholes that make it infinitely harder to achieve. We\u0027ll just have a bit more freedom in how we present it. Also, today we\u0027re bringing you an episode of a podcast I\u0027ve been producing about abortion, called \u0022Outlawed\u0022: Join two OB-Gyns as they explain the science and stories of abortion in the US. Misinformation is unfortunately everywhere. Listening to this podcast will give you the knowledge and tools you need to help navigate these difficult conversations with family and friends at the dining room table. Throughout the season we will interview physicians, researchers, advocates and experts, as we navigate this contentious topic and make sense of the reality of abortion care in the US.

Sam himself had spent years proclaiming the fund\u0027s brilliant results. In reality, Sam had been marking his own homework, publishing fraudulent accounts and using these to lure in new investors. What to do? Well, the logical thing of course: wait around for an extraordinary profitable streak, and in the meantime keep up the ruse... We\u0027re bringing you an episode of Cautionary Tales with Tim Harford . This episode was recorded live at the Bristol Festival of Economics and studies three incredible investment scams.

In the meantime, we want to introduce a brand new show from Little Everywhere and Pushkin Industries\u2026.Other People\u0027s Pockets. Hosted by Maya Lau, a former investigative journalist for the LA Times, Other People\u2019s Pockets gets uncomfortably specific about how each guest earns, values, saves and even loses money. Maya\u2019s not afraid to ask the tough questions: How much do you make? What social class do you consider yourself a part of? What do you spend your money on that you know you shouldn\u0027t? And, what\u2019s your net worth? You\u2019ll be surprised at the reactions, ranging from uncomfortable hedging to radical financial transparency. In today\u2019s episode, Jane Marie, host of The Dream, turns the table on Maya, asking her all of the same taboo questions normally reserved for OPP guests!
