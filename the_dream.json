      "description": "We\u0027ve known about it for almost 20 years and yet there is still very little being done to combat Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy - more commonly none as CTE. And if you think this only affects NFL players, think again. CTE is available in all shapes and sizes - whether it\u0027s youth hockey, high school football, club soccer leagues, or professional wrestling, so many of our young athletes are in the line of fire. Thankfully, for most of those twenty years, former college football player and professional wrestler - turned anti-CTE advocate and head of Boston University\u0027s CTE center - Chris Nowinski, has taken it upon himself to stare this issue down and make sure parents, coaches and athletes have accurate information about what happens when someone suffers continual head injuries. Chris even managed to get a Phd in behavioral neuroscience along the way, so that he could understand and further the science behind CTE research. Today he joins host Jane Marie to talk about his career, his advocacy and what we know about the current state of CTE in sports. \n Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",

And, what\u2019s your net worth? You\u2019ll be surprised at the reactions, ranging from uncomfortable hedging to radical financial transparency. In today\u2019s episode, Jane Marie, host of The Dream, turns the table on Maya, asking her all of the same taboo questions normally reserved for OPP guests!

They aren\u2019t just trying to sell you something, but would like to offer you the opportunity of a lifetime to achieve riches while working from home on your own terms. You\u2019ve probably been too afraid, or too loving, or too reasonable to confront them. Not us. This season on The Dream we go inside the world of multi-level marketing to expose this pyramid-shaped business model for what it is. Join us on this bizarre journey filled with snake oil salesmen, shifty millionaires, struggling single moms, and a few sweet grandmas.See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",
