She was on her own, had a new baby and was working hard as an editor at the feminist website,\u00A0Jezebel. Then, it all came crashing down when an editor at Gawker, the umbrella site Jezebel was published under, released a story about a recently discovered Hulk Hogan sex tape -\u00A0including footage.\nEnter Peter Theil, who had been looking for a reason to settle a score with Gawker when the Hulk scandal fell squarely in his lap. Theil ended up funding Hollywood Hulk\u0027s long, costly legal battle and when it was all said and done, Gawker couldn\u0027t keep up with the Theil money being thrown at them. They also made a few mistakes during depositions and trial testimony out of, let\u0027s just say, hubris, that didn\u0027t curry favor with the Judge deciding the case.\u00A0When Gawker fell, it took everyone associated with the site down with it.\nOn this week\u0027s episode, Jane sits down with the once cocky and brash Gawker editor, AJ Daulerio (the one who decided to publish the Hogan story), to talk about the where and the why of it all and find out if anything\u0027s changed in AJ\u0027s life since the heady days of the 2010\u0027s.\n\nYou can find more from AJ and his current work with The Small Bow here:\nSubstack: https://www.thesmallbow.com/\nInstagram: @smallbownewsletter\nPodcast: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-small-bow-podcast/id1576208098\n\n Hosted on Acast.

And if you think this only affects NFL players, think again. CTE is available in all shapes and sizes - whether it\u0027s youth hockey, high school football, club soccer leagues, or professional wrestling, so many of our young athletes are in the line of fire. Thankfully, for most of those twenty years, former college football player and professional wrestler - turned anti-CTE advocate and head of Boston University\u0027s CTE center - Chris Nowinski, has taken it upon himself to stare this issue down and make sure parents, coaches and athletes have accurate information about what happens when someone suffers continual head injuries. Chris even managed to get a Phd in behavioral neuroscience along the way, so that he could understand and further the science behind CTE research. Today he joins host Jane Marie to talk about his career, his advocacy and what we know about the current state of CTE in sports. \n Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",

In the meantime, we want to introduce a brand new show from Little Everywhere and Pushkin Industries\u2026.Other People\u0027s Pockets. Hosted by Maya Lau, a former investigative journalist for the LA Times, Other People\u2019s Pockets gets uncomfortably specific about how each guest earns, values, saves and even loses money. Maya\u2019s not afraid to ask the tough questions: How much do you make? What social class do you consider yourself a part of? What do you spend your money on that you know you shouldn\u0027t? And, what\u2019s your net worth? You\u2019ll be surprised at the reactions, ranging from uncomfortable hedging to radical financial transparency. In today\u2019s episode, Jane Marie, host of The Dream, turns the table on Maya, asking her all of the same taboo questions normally reserved for OPP guests!
