      "description": "This week marks the season 2 launch of the critically acclaimed podcast Outlawed. To celebrate, we are re-running episode 7 from Outlawed season one, Tension of Opposites:\nOne of the most contentious topics of the last election cycle was abortion later in pregnancy (often mislabeled as \u201Clate term abortion\u201D). Anti-abortion activists and politicians promote heinous misinformation about this care. This includes false claims that abortion is being performed after birth, an inaccurate and manipulative description of palliative care for babies born with grave physical and/or genetic abnormalities. This episode confronts both of these topics head on as we talk with OB-Gyn expert Dr. Jenni Villavicencio. She walks us through why care later in pregnancy is necessary and how patients are making thoughtful decisions for themselves and their families. Jenni also talks about her transformation for anti-abortion protestor to abortion care provider. We also debunk myths about abortion after birth and talk about the realities of palliative care for infants with lethal birth defects.\u00A0\nEnjoy the show and don\u0027t forget to subscribe to season 2 here:\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/outlawed/id1780888188\n\n Hosted on Acast.

Then, it all came crashing down when an editor at Gawker, the umbrella site Jezebel was published under, released a story about a recently discovered Hulk Hogan sex tape -\u00A0including footage.\nEnter Peter Theil, who had been looking for a reason to settle a score with Gawker when the Hulk scandal fell squarely in his lap. Theil ended up funding Hollywood Hulk\u0027s long, costly legal battle and when it was all said and done, Gawker couldn\u0027t keep up with the Theil money being thrown at them. They also made a few mistakes during depositions and trial testimony out of, let\u0027s just say, hubris, that didn\u0027t curry favor with the Judge deciding the case.\u00A0When Gawker fell, it took everyone associated with the site down with it.\nOn this week\u0027s episode, Jane sits down with the once cocky and brash Gawker editor, AJ Daulerio (the one who decided to publish the Hogan story), to talk about the where and the why of it all and find out if anything\u0027s changed in AJ\u0027s life since the heady days of the 2010\u0027s.\n\nYou can find more from AJ and his current work with The Small Bow here:\nSubstack: https://www.thesmallbow.com/\nInstagram: @smallbownewsletter\nPodcast: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-small-bow-podcast/id1576208098\n\n Hosted on Acast.

And if you think this only affects NFL players, think again. CTE is available in all shapes and sizes - whether it\u0027s youth hockey, high school football, club soccer leagues, or professional wrestling, so many of our young athletes are in the line of fire. Thankfully, for most of those twenty years, former college football player and professional wrestler - turned anti-CTE advocate and head of Boston University\u0027s CTE center - Chris Nowinski, has taken it upon himself to stare this issue down and make sure parents, coaches and athletes have accurate information about what happens when someone suffers continual head injuries. Chris even managed to get a Phd in behavioral neuroscience along the way, so that he could understand and further the science behind CTE research. Today he joins host Jane Marie to talk about his career, his advocacy and what we know about the current state of CTE in sports. \n Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",

We\u0027re reimagining The Dream as a weekly interview podcast with guests and segments about, I don\u0027t know.... whatever we want? Don\u0027t worry! We\u0027ll still be focused on the \u0022American Dream\u0022 and all the assholes that make it infinitely harder to achieve. We\u0027ll just have a bit more freedom in how we present it. Also, today we\u0027re bringing you an episode of a podcast I\u0027ve been producing about abortion, called \u0022Outlawed\u0022: Join two OB-Gyns as they explain the science and stories of abortion in the US. Misinformation is unfortunately everywhere. Listening to this podcast will give you the knowledge and tools you need to help navigate these difficult conversations with family and friends at the dining room table. Throughout the season we will interview physicians, researchers, advocates and experts, as we navigate this contentious topic and make sense of the reality of abortion care in the US. And DO NOT forget to check back in a few weeks for new episodes of The Dream! Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",

Sam himself had spent years proclaiming the fund\u0027s brilliant results. In reality, Sam had been marking his own homework, publishing fraudulent accounts and using these to lure in new investors. What to do? Well, the logical thing of course: wait around for an extraordinary profitable streak, and in the meantime keep up the ruse... We\u0027re bringing you an episode of Cautionary Tales with Tim Harford . This episode was recorded live at the Bristol Festival of Economics and studies three incredible investment scams.

In the meantime, we want to introduce a brand new show from Little Everywhere and Pushkin Industries\u2026.Other People\u0027s Pockets. Hosted by Maya Lau, a former investigative journalist for the LA Times, Other People\u2019s Pockets gets uncomfortably specific about how each guest earns, values, saves and even loses money. Maya\u2019s not afraid to ask the tough questions: How much do you make? What social class do you consider yourself a part of? What do you spend your money on that you know you shouldn\u0027t? And, what\u2019s your net worth? You\u2019ll be surprised at the reactions, ranging from uncomfortable hedging to radical financial transparency. In today\u2019s episode, Jane Marie, host of The Dream, turns the table on Maya, asking her all of the same taboo questions normally reserved for OPP guests! You can hear more from Other People\u0027s Pockets at apple.co/pockets.\u00A0See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",

You\u2019ve probably been too afraid, or too loving, or too reasonable to confront them. Not us.

Join us on this bizarre journey filled with snake oil salesmen, shifty millionaires, struggling single moms, and a few sweet grandmas.See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",
