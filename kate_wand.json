      "description": "\u0022In April 2020, with nothing else to do, my family took an enormous number of hikes. We all wore cloth masks that I had made myself. We had a family hand signal, which the person in the front would use if someone was approaching on the trail and we needed to put on our masks.  Once, when another child got too close to my then-4-year-old son on a bridge, he yelled at her \u201CSOCIAL DISTANCING!\u201D\n\nThese precautions were totally misguided. In April 2020, no one got the \u0027rona from passing someone else hiking. Outdoor transmission was vanishingly rare. Our cloth masks made out of old bandanas wouldn\u2019t have done anything, anyway. But the thing is: We didn\u2019t know.\u0022 \n\nWe discuss:\n\u0022LET\u2019S DECLARE A PANDEMIC AMNESTY\nLet\u2019s focus on the future, and fix the problems we still need to solve.\u0022 By Emily Oster\n\nWhat does it mean to forgive and forget? Is this really the way to move forward?\n\nA short film on forgiveness and holding people accountable.\n\nCreators: Kate Wand \u0026 William Gervais\n\nFB: https://www.facebook.com/VeryOpinionatedShow \nOdysee: https://odysee.com/@VeryOpinionatedShow:5\nTwitter: @katewand | @wg_gervais \nKate\u0027s Musings: katewand.substack.com\n\nVERY-OPINIONATED.COM",
