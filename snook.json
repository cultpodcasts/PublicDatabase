In today\u2019s video, we\u2019re getting into the disturbing world of internet cults.

They are sadistic nightmares.\n\nThese cults use forums, encrypted apps, and even mainstream platforms to spread influence, manipulate minds, and push people toward unthinkable actions. \n\nWARNING:\u00A0This video includes references to extremely disturbing content, including violence, radical ideology, and psychological manipulation. Viewer discretion is\u00A0advised.\n\nIf you\u2019re drawn to internet mysteries, true crime, or the dark psychology behind people, this video and channel is for you.
