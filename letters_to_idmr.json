      "description": "Probably the most unrealistic story in the entire Bible is Noah\u0027s flood. There\u0027s dozens of principles that all depend on defying all laws of nature that rely on a series of miracles and lots of magic to fill all the gaps. \uFFFCprime example: Spirit Law or the so-called \u201Claw of nature\u201D shows that water evaporates, condenses in the atmosphere, and then precipitates as an immutable self sustaining cycle. The Noah\u2019s flood story asks the modern person to believe this simple law was radically different. That it had never rained before? Do we also believe in Santa Claus ? \n\nHenry Kinley seemed to give validity to the story professing how the story of the flood\u0022 fits the pattern.\u0022 as he contorted subjective principles such as \u0022 the blood upon their heads\u0022 a metaphor not a literal show of blood, is an example of such a contortion he used to assert that principles of blood water and spirit are found here. Also the principle of\n40. The reason there are so many \u002240\u0027s\u0022 throughout the especially Old Testament and also some in the New Testament is because in biblical times the number 40 to noted \u0022 a long period of time\u0022 in days exceeding a month or \u0022 moon\u0022 28 day. In years 40 it\u0027s about two \u0022generations..\u0022 . But it is not an accurate scaled measurement it\u0027s approximate. This is why so many 40\u0027s appear in the text of the Bible.",

      "description": "Kinley alluded in his literature and lectures that his revelations and exposure of the errors of the Roman Catholic Church were the direct cause of Pope John XXII to call the 21st Ecumenical Council. Although there is no direct evidence that the pope or the Vatican ever interacted with Kinley\u2019s work. More importantly, this Ecumenical Council was planned and announced on January 25, 1959. That newly elected pope had expressed a desire to \u201Cupdate the churches teachings.\u201D Known by a Latin term: \u201C an aggiromento \u201C. The post World War II era gradually saw many changes to the western developed world lifestyle. In 1946 for example only 8000 homes had television sets, compared to 1959 over 52 million homes had television sets. Interstate highways, facilitating quicker travel throughout the country. The expansion of media connecting rapid transmission of information across hemispheres. Other factors such as the development of the birth control, which were amongst groundbreaking innovations that changed American lifestyles and caused more women to enter the workforce. The Roman Catholic Church could no longer appeal to the old world mindset. They needed to make changes, and loosen restrictions to stay appealing to the modern world. The claim that the 1961 release of \u201C God the Archetype ( Original ) Pattern of the Universe \u201C had any bearing on the decision for Vatican or Pope John XXIII \uFFFCto call for the 21st Ecumenical Council on January 25, 1959 is easily debunked since the timing of H.C. Kinley\u2019s book didn\u2019t go out until later in 1961. Our aim here is to show that this narrative that IDMR had a profound impact on the world is not corroborated with outside evidence.",

      "description": "At the request of a channel subscriber, this letter was drafted to explore the specific teachings of Dr. Robert Harris that moved the institute away from original doctrine taught by the founder of HC Kinley. \n\nHarris served as the second international dean of the IDMR from 1971 to 2018, when he passed at the age of 98 years. Beginning around 1990, Harris oversaw the systematic destruction of IDMR\u0027s core values and beliefs, and upended decades of lectures when he introduced concepts such as the fallen angels, Yahshua saving himself, the red man in the cloud, the need to worship a man on the ground, and more. \n\nWe hope you enjoy this deep dive into Harris\u0027s progressive revelations. As long as this letter is, we\u0027ve only scratched the surface, attempting to hit the most significant examples of Harris most divisive teachings that divided the IDMR and led a majority of the organization into apostasy.\n\nYou may enjoy this letter more on a faster playback speed.",

      "description": "This letter examines the true motivations for the IDMR\u0027s massive migration to Los Angeles and Banning, CA over the last 15 years and the significant impact on their branches and members. \n\nThe IDMR history of pilgrimages is well established dating back to the original move from Ohio to Los Angeles in 1958, the outreach of deans leaving California beginning in 1966 to set up schools in locations such as NY, Georgia, Arkansas, and Michigan, and then the culmination of a great return after Harris failed to predict the end of the world on four separate occasions. We hypothesize that the motivations were much more than the patching of Robert Harris\u0027 bruised ego at all of the empty seats, but a reflection of his deeper understanding that without drastic action, the school would fade into oblivion after his demise. Brilliantly, he stirred his most faithful to action, bringing them home to LA, reinvigorating a power base for the Institute to heal its wounds of failure and rise from the ashes. Sadly, the rest of the school has suffered in the wake of such a bold move, and the IDMR will never be the same.",

This calls into question the concept that he had received a vision and revelation that was all encompassing from the start, and indicates a progressive revelation that evolved and changed over the years.",

      "description": "This letter boldly challenges the IDMR\u0027s practice of man worship. Our aim is to shed light on the toxicity of demanding followers to worship a leader as God, despite clear evidence against it. This harmful practice not only misguides individuals but also perpetuates a cycle of control and manipulation.\n\nWe take drug use and addiction seriously and do not make light of these issues. Substance abuse is a complex and pervasive problem that requires compassionate and comprehensive support. We empathize with those affected and strongly encourage them to seek help through appropriate channels, including medical professionals, support groups, and rehabilitation programs.\n\nSimilarly, we urge those ensnared by the delusion of worshiping a flawed human as God to seek assistance. The psychological and emotional toll of such beliefs can be profound, leading to a loss of personal autonomy and critical thinking. We advocate for mental health support and counseling for those seeking to break free from these harmful doctrines.\n\nIt is essential to foster an environment where individuals can reclaim their sense of self-worth and autonomy, free from the oppressive influence of misguided worship. By raising awareness and offering support, we hope to empower those affected to pursue healthier, more fulfilling paths in life.",

This is a deep mystery in Christianity, which is ironic because the Death, Burial, and Resurrection on the 3rd day is the Gospel, according to the Apostle Paul. It is the core of Christian faith, and the reason they went out to colonize the world. Ministers have even offered money for someone to show how this was possible, given the crucifixion on Friday and the resurrection on Sunday. Many IDMR believe that Kinley was the only one who had ever successfully explained this, \u0022day known only to Yahweh.\u0022 And in so doing, believers in the IDMR use this as one of their primary proofs in justifying the worship of Kinley as God.",

The first session will be held this coming Saturday, March 30, 2024 (Easter Weekend).  \n\nAs the students all over Southern California gather to present themselves before Pat Nelson, International Superintendent at the Founder\u0027s Church in Los Angeles, CA this weekend, we who represent the many tired masses of the disenfranchised IDMR members have drafted a list of suggested questions to kick off the first session. These were mailed to Pat Nelson through the United States Postal Service and should have arrived by Thursday, March 28, 2024. \n\nOur earnest desire is that these questions are addressed honestly and truthfully, with love. And that they help set the tone for a new era of transparency and openness from IDMR leadership as we look forward to future sessions. \n\nLet the doors of the church open and feel the rush of fresh air filling the assembly!",
