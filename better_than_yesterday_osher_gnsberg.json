      "description": "You failed? Great! \u2018The Guilty Feminist\u2019 podcast host, comedian and writer Deborah Frances-White believes that embracing our failures is the key to success. We won\u2019t always get everything right, but that\u2019s OK. We learn the most by failing. Deborah Frances-White joined Osher in Sydney while she was in town for the Australian leg of The Guilty Feminist tour. Deborah shares her story of growing up as a Jehovah\u2019s Witness in Brisbane. It turns out Osher and Deborah went to the same theatre sports school at the same time! They discuss privilege versus access, the importance of belonging, what being our authentic selves really means and how improvised comedy can help us trust our instincts.
