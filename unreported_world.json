      "title": "Inside Kenya\u2019s Christian Death Cult | Unreported World",
      "description": "Unreported World investigates how one influential preacher in Kenya could have led hundreds of men, women and children to their deaths. Symeon Brown tracks down the survivors and the families searching for loved ones to find out if this was mass suicide, or mass murder.  \n\nSo far 429 bodies have been exhumed from graves in Shakahola forest where Pastor Paul Mackenzie\u2019s followers are believed to have starved to death. The leader of the so-called death cult is said to have promised his followers protection from the \u0027coming apocalypse\u0027. Mackenzie denies any wrongdoing. \n\nMeanwhile another church, Rainbow Ministries, is facing a crackdown for cult-like behaviour. But where is the line between faith and extremism? \n\nProducer/Director: Tom Besley\nSeries Producer: Andy Lee\nExecutive Producer: Ed Fraser\nProduction Company: Channel 4 News\n\nSubscribe to our channel for more Unreported World episodes https://www.youtube.com/unreportedworld.",
