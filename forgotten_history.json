      "description": "\uD83D\uDE80 In the late 1990s, a quiet mansion in California became the stage for one of the most disturbing cult events in American history. Heaven\u2019s Gate, led by Marshall Applewhite, promised salvation through a spaceship trailing the Hale-Bopp comet. But how did a college music teacher convince 38 people to leave everything\u2014and everyone\u2014behind?\n\nThis Forgotten History episode dives into the bizarre blend of sci-fi, religion, and psychological control that defined Heaven\u2019s Gate. From their castration rituals to their eerie farewell tapes, we uncover how a seemingly harmless spiritual movement transformed into a deadly cult. Written and hosted by Mike Droberg. Forgotten History is a 10th Legion Pictures Production.\n\n\uD83D\uDCAC Comment below: Do you think something like this could happen again today?\n#HeavensGate #MarshallApplewhite #Cults \n====================================================================\nHelp support our channel:\nForgotten History Merchandise: https://fh-shop.fourthwall.com/\nPatreon page: https://www.patreon.com/ForgottenHistoryChannel\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ5kKhnQUbZmABUeJJvj9aw/join\n====================================================================\nThanks for watching.
