      "description": "Today we speak with Alan Allard.\u00A0 Alan was a psychotherapist in private practice for 12 years in the Chicago suburbs. Since 2005 he has been a coach and is an expert in helping abuse and trauma victims take ownership of their life and begin to thrive. He works with clients who have experienced sexual abuse, abusive relationships, adverse childhood experiences, and especially spiritual and religious abuse.More specifically, Alan has spent many years as a therapist or coach to members of the ICOC or similar religious organizations.\u00A0 It should also be mentioned that he was a member of the ICOC in Chicago, from 1987 until the year 2000. \u00A0Alan speaks to us today about those days when he was a therapist, in part, to members of the ICOC and how what was discussed in his therapy sessions was a contradiction with what the church taught.Alan discusses the concept of Personal Agency vs. Spiritual Authority and how the latter has been used to undermine the former. \u00A0Alan further explains that if one isn\u2019t the authority in their own life, then they will find someone or something to fill that void. \u00A0He also speaks to us about the idea of blind obedience or toxic trust and it\u2019s potential harmful impact within the context of spiritual authority. \u00A0Alan is the author of Enlightened Happiness: Seven Secrets to the Life You Were Meant to live available on amazon.com. To get in contact with Alan, you can reach him at AlanAllard.com or LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/alanallard/.\u00A0 He has a private Facebook group, \u0022Growing Through Adversity: How to Own Your Life and Thrive you are welcome to check out--contact Alan for a link to the group.Support the showStay updated on Aldo\u0027s current and future projects by signing up for his NewsletterOther Podcasts by Aldo B.

      "description": "Long before the Henry Kriete Letter was delivered to the hands of ICOC members around the globe, the brothers and sisters of the London Church of Christ set the table. \u00A0 The regular disciples of that church began to speak up about the injustices that they\u2019ve experienced.\u00A0 It seems that they did so because they wanted to preserve and protect the church that they loved from continuing their harmful practices. \u00A0 They held open forums and created the working groups.\u00A0 Today, we are going to hear from three men who were present at one of these meetings.\u00A0 The three of them sat down to have a conversation and recollected the tone and outcome of that meeting.\u00A0 The original meeting took place on February 1, 2003.\u00A0 This episode is being released on February 1, 2023.\u00A0 Twenty years to the day. \u00A0Why is this important?\u00A0 Simply put, notion of such a meeting and it\u0027s subsequent minutes\u00A0 demonstrate that the issues that the ICOC has had and continues to have, according to the people that have recently left, are not new.\u00A0 The issues have been spoken about before.\u00A0 The issues have been written about before.\u00A0 As former members attempt to make sense of what they were a part of, it is important to take a look back, in order to move forward.\u00A0 \u00A0Support the showStay updated on Aldo\u0027s current and future projects by signing up for his NewsletterOther Podcasts by Aldo B.
