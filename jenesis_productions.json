Among them:\n- Doug Weiss\u0027 polygraph, in which he was asked a blunt question about Joni Lamb.\n- How Joni confronted Marcus Lamb about his lengthy affair with an employee, and how he reacted.\n- Whether Doug Weiss counseled Marcus and Joni through their marital challenges.\n- Anna Kendall\u0027s (\u0022Red Wig\u0022) impression when she met Doug\u0027s former wife, Lisa. \n- Why God \u0022clapped His hands\u0022 at Joni Lamb.\n\nThis recording is from an emergency board meeting held on August 29, 2023. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss how to publicly address the absence of Jonathan and Suzy Lamb from Daystar\u0027s program, Ministry Now. Board chair Joni Lamb and board members Arnold Torres and Jonathan Lamb were in attendance in person. Board member Tom Calender participated earlier in the meeting by phone to discuss Jonathan and Suzy\u0027s situation, but hung up before this lengthy portion of the conversation.",

      "description": "The public battle between Joni Lamb and her son and daughter-in-law started over their refusal to read a viewer comment praising her new husband during a live broadcast in July 2023. Jonathan and Suzy Lamb opposed the marriage of Daystar\u2019s CEO to divorced sex therapist Doug Weiss on biblical principles. The couple was immediately removed from Ministry Now and Suzy was fired. Jonathan was demoted and eventually terminated, too. Did Daystar violate the couple\u0027s religious rights?\n\nAn audio recording of a board meeting on November 16, 2023 raises questions about whether Daystar backpedaled on those disciplinary actions. The Civil Rights Act prohibits religious discrimination in the workplace. Attorney John Lynch told Jonathan Lamb he had no legal claim, but Lynch and the board members reversed their position about Jonathan having to submit, and decided he did not have to read anything that violated his religious beliefs. Board members Tom Calender and Arnold Torres also spoke during the meeting. \n\nWhat do you think? Did Daystar change its mind because of potential legal issues? Was it a C.Y.A. move?",

There is no indication that Marcus ever had those worries or any conversation about it with Jonathan. \n\n\nIncluded in the video are previous clips where Joni Lamb threatens Jonathan and Suzy with demonic activity in their lives if they don\u2019t submit to her. Joni also predicts curses on her own grandchildren because of Jonathan and Suzy\u2019s so-called rebellion.\n\n#TheRealJoniLamb",
