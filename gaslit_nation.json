      "description": "Fifteen years after Sarah Silverman\u2019s viral call to \u201CSell the Vatican, Feed the World,\u201D we now have a \u201CMarxist Pope,\u201D according to Trump stormtrooper Laura Loomer, and our wildest dreams. This week for Gaslit Nation\u2019s bonus show, we dive into the groundbreaking election of the first American pope, Robert Francis Prevost, now Pope Leo XIV, whose ancestry ties him to Black lineage. While many celebrate this historic milestone, deeper questions remain. \r\n\r\n Most crucially, Pope Leo\u2019s stance on Opus Dei, a secretive, powerful crime cult aligned with far-right politics and accused of human trafficking and labor abuses, remains unclear, especially given his close connections to Opus Dei in Peru. By Vatican standards, Pope Francis launched an open war on Opus Dei. (Fun fact: Robert Hanssen, the FBI agent and traitor who spied for the Kremlin, was an Opus Dei member). \r\n\r\n Pope Francis began the work of reigning in Opus Dei\u2019s unchecked power. Pope Leo, seen as a moderate administrator, played both sides during his tenure in Peru, where Opus Dei holds sway. Will he now take bold action to finish Francis\u2019s mission, and protect the world from Opus Dei, especially America where Opus Dei has been expanding its influence in Washington, DC, thanks to allies Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society and Kevin Roberts of the Heritage Foundation and Project 2025? \r\n\r\n Want to enjoy Gaslit Nation ad-free?

      "description": "How does Franco\u2019s reign in Spain connect to the rise of Trump? In this gripping true-crime thriller, financial journalist Gareth Gore, while investigating a bank collapse in Spain, follows the money trail to uncover a vast international conspiracy behind Opus Dei. What is Opus Dei? It\u0027s a shadowy global right-wing organization founded in Spain just before the Spanish Civil War. Supported by powerful Republican figures like Leonard Leo, Opus Dei is a Christian nationalist movement fueling efforts to dismantle democracy and pave the way for dictatorship in America. Gore, the author of the explosive book Opus: The Cult of Dark Money, Human Trafficking, and Right-Wing Conspiracy Inside the Catholic Church , delves into this insidious network. In this chilling conversation, recorded just before the U.S. election, Gore reveals how Opus Dei\u2019s influence stretches from Capitol Hill to the Supreme Court\u2014and what is being done, including by the Pope, to try to curb its destructive power. This week\u0027s bonus show features a live interview with Dr. Emma Briant, one of the world\u2019s foremost experts on disinformation warfare and propaganda. Dr. Briant, co-editor of The Routledge Handbook on the Influence Industry and author of Propaganda and Counter-Terrorism: Strategies for Global Change, shares invaluable insights into the weapons of global propaganda.
