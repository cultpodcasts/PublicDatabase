      "title": "Why Do So Many Cults Start As Offshoots Of The LDS Church?",
      "description": "Tony Brueski and Psychotherapist and Author Shavaun Scott engage in a thought-provoking discussion about the tendency for cults to originate as offshoots of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). They consider the LDS Church\u0027s doctrinal uniqueness, organizational structure, and history as possible factors that can foster such splinter groups.
