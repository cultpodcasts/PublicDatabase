      "description": "In this episode, Amanda reconnects with her cousin Jared Smith after more than a decade apart. Growing up together in Mississippi after Amanda\u0027s family moved from Arizona, Jared was Amanda\u2019s first white cousin among a sea of Mexican cousins\u2014an early sign that his path might look different from others. The two shared many childhood memories, but after drifting apart for 13\u201315 years, Amanda is eager to hear how Jared\u2019s life has unfolded. Jared shares openly about his deep roots in the Holdeman Mennonite church, describing himself as the \u0022poster child\u0022 for the faith. Coming from a family of ministers, he was seen as someone destined to continue in the tradition. But as he puts it, he eventually \u0022broke the mold.\u0022 In a conversation that\u2019s both reflective and full of life, Jared walks us through his journey of leaving the church, which he began around 2018. It wasn\u2019t a clean break at first\u2014he stayed connected for a few more years before finally relocating to Arizona and severing ties completely. It was one of the hardest things he\u2019s ever done, but also one of the best. He speaks with emotion about the mental and emotional toll of leaving and how difficult it was to even begin to understand himself outside the church. But today, Jared says his life is full and beautiful. He has a 15-year-old daughter and a 12-year-old son, and he\u2019s built a life filled with personal growth, business success, and genuine well-being. \u201CNot what we were told when we were leaving,\u201D he notes, but undeniably good. Whether you\u0027re familiar with the Holdeman world or completely new to it, Jared\u0027s story offers a powerful look at what it means to step away from a high-control religious community and discover a vibrant, fulfilling life on the other side.

      "description": "This episode of Our People: Holdeman Mennonite Stories features a conversation with Janice Selby, a therapist, author, podcaster, and YouTuber specializing in religious trauma. Hosted by Amanda Esau and Wayla, the discussion explores Janice\u2019s personal journey growing up in a Pentecostal household in Kelowna, British Columbia, and later encountering the Holdeman Mennonites in adulthood.\nJanice shares how her early religious experiences, which included speaking in tongues and anointing with oil, shaped her understanding of faith and obedience. However, as she began questioning her beliefs, she found herself on a path of deconstruction that ultimately led her to work in religious trauma recovery. A pivotal part of her journey was her time spent among the Holdeman Mennonites, where she gained firsthand insight into the church\u2019s strict control over members\u2019 lives. She discusses the psychological impact of leaving such a high-demand religious community, the pressure to conform, and the deep emotional toll of shunning and isolation.\nWith warmth and candor, Janice reflects on the struggles of breaking free from religious indoctrination and the long road to healing. She shares her professional insights on the challenges of religious trauma, the guilt and fear that often linger, and the importance of rebuilding a sense of self outside of rigid belief systems. Whether you have personal experience with the Holdemans or are simply interested in the broader topic of religious trauma, this episode offers a compelling, compassionate, and deeply insightful perspective.\nFollow us on Facebook:\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\nhttps://rb.gy/cj55td\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\nSubscribe on Spotify:\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060 https://open.spotify.com/show/1KwYkbtbIswUN3z6JSrqz5?si=0913b1c334724490\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\nSubscribe on YouTube:\n\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060https://www.youtube.com/@OurPeoplePodcast?sub_confirmation=1\n\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060Subscribe on Apple Podcasts:\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/our-people-holdeman-mennonite-stories/id1740613045\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\nAre you or is someone you know interested in sharing a story on the podcast?

      "description": "In this heartfelt episode of Our People: Holdeman Mennonite Stories, Amanda and Waylon welcome Justin Hunt to share his remarkable journey through life, faith, and self-discovery. Born in 1990 in St. Mary\u2019s, Ontario, Justin opens up about his early life as the youngest of five children, navigating the challenges of his parents\u2019 separation and the pivotal decision of his mother to join the Holdeman Mennonite Church.

As Justin recounts his later years, he delves into the struggles of reconciling his own beliefs with the expectations of the Holdeman Church.

Through candid and vulnerable storytelling, Justin discusses the difficult but ultimately rewarding process of forging a life outside the confines of the church. He reflects on the lessons he\u2019s carried with him and how his journey has shaped the person he is today. From his early days in a tightly knit community to finding his voice and place in a wider world, Justin\u2019s story is one of courage, resilience, and self-discovery. This episode offers a profound look at the intersections of faith, family, and personal growth.

Following her kidnapping, she details years of abuse including sexual assaults and regular beatings that left major emotional scars. Mamzy, as her loved ones call her, goes on to describe how her \u0022foster parents\u0022 turned her into a missionary, pressing her to try to convert fellow indigenous children. At one point, she recounts, she was told to hide several Indigenous children within the childcare facility so that their parents could not take them home. Eventually, police intervened, stopping the abduction. As she grew older, she left the church and built a life of her own. Mamzy pursued an education in Indigenous counseling and has a family of her own. If you would like to learn more about her story, her forthcoming book is titled The Lucky One: A Memoir of the Sixty Scoop Woman by Roberta McKinnen.",

      "description": "In this episode of Our People: Holdeman Mennonite Stories, Waylon and Amanda welcome Ray, who takes us on a journey through his life as a member of the Church of God in Christ Mennonite. Ray begins by introducing himself as someone currently living in Muskogee, Oklahoma, but his story starts in the small, tight-knit congregation of Crooked Creek in northern Alberta, Canada. At just four years old, Ray\u2019s family moved to Kansas, where he grew up in the Fredonia congregation, a community that profoundly shaped his worldview and sense of belonging. Ray shares vivid anecdotes from his upbringing, including the challenges of transitioning from one congregation to another at a young age and the deep familial roots that connected him to the church. His father was an outsider who joined the Holdeman faith, while his mother came from a well-established Holdeman family in Halstead, Kansas. These contrasting backgrounds provided Ray with a unique perspective on faith, tradition, and the sense of community within the church. One of the most impactful chapters of Ray\u2019s life was his time in the Holdeman voluntary service units, an alternative to military service for conscientious objectors. He recounts how this experience gave him the opportunity to step outside the insular Holdeman world and connect with others in meaningful ways while still adhering to the church\u2019s commitment to nonviolence. Ray reflects on the camaraderie, challenges, and moments of personal growth he experienced during his time in voluntary service, offering a rare glimpse into how this tradition shaped his understanding of work, service, and faith. His stories from this period reveal both the joys and the challenges of maintaining the Holdeman values in a broader societal context. Throughout the conversation, Ray reflects on the distinct practices and beliefs that defined his early life. He discusses the church\u0027s emphasis on unity, the simplicity of lifestyle, and the powerful role of family in shaping personal and spiritual identity. He also touches on the sacrifices and decisions his parents made in their faith journey and how those choices impacted his own understanding of what it means to grow up within a high-control religious group. Ray doesn\u2019t shy away from discussing the challenges of Holdeman life. He talks about the cultural expectations placed on individuals and families and the way those expectations influenced his upbringing. His stories offer a nuanced perspective on the joys and struggles of belonging to such a close-knit faith community. This episode is a heartfelt exploration of roots, resilience, and faith as Ray offers a window into his life\u2019s journey. Whether you grew up in the Holdeman church or are curious about its culture and traditions, this conversation is full of relatable moments and deep reflections on the enduring impact of faith, family, and service.

      "description": "In this heartfelt episode of Our People: Holdeman Mennonite Stories, we sit down with Rosina Friesen, who offers a candid and inspiring account of her life\u2019s journey. Born in 1950 in Crooked Creek, Alberta, Rosina grew up as the third of nine children in a bustling, hardworking family. Now living in Peace River, Alberta, she reflects on her early years in a traditional, close-knit community, shaped by the teachings of the Church of God in Christ Mennonite. Rosina\u2019s story takes us through her career as a licensed practical nurse, a path she pursued with determination and compassion. She speaks about the joys and challenges of working in healthcare, especially as she balanced her professional aspirations with the church\u0027s strict gender roles and expectations. Her nursing career became a place where she could channel her innate drive to help others, but it also highlighted the tensions she felt between her evolving personal values and the constraints of her faith. As Rosina began questioning the church\u2019s teachings, particularly its emphasis on conformity and control, she faced an inner battle that ultimately led to her decision to leave. She reflects on the courage it took to walk away from the only community she had ever known, and the profound personal growth she experienced in doing so. Leaving the church was not just about stepping into a new chapter but about rebuilding her sense of identity and autonomy. While it came with heartbreak\u2014especially in navigating relationships with loved ones still in the church\u2014it also brought new opportunities for self-discovery. One of the most striking anecdotes Rosina shares is how, later in life, she took up running as a way to challenge herself and embrace her independence. She humorously recounts the struggles and triumphs of starting to run as an elderly woman, defying expectations and finding joy in surprising new ways. This anecdote reflects a recurring theme in her story: the resilience to embrace change, the courage to try something new, and the determination to live life on her own terms. Rosina\u2019s journey is a powerful reminder that it\u2019s never too late to reinvent yourself, seek freedom, and carve out a life that reflects who you truly are. With warmth, humility, and a spark of humor, she invites listeners to reflect on their own paths and the strength it takes to walk toward authenticity.

      "description": "In this episode of Our People: Holdeman Mennonite Stories, Weylin Unruh sits down with Nolan Raber to discuss his life growing up in the Church of God in Christ Mennonite community and his journey of leaving the church. Nolan starts by sharing his early years in Kidron, Ohio, where he spent the first eight years of his life. He reflects on the close-knit nature of the Holdeman community and the strong emphasis on conformity, which played a significant role in shaping his upbringing. Nolan opens up about the expectations and pressures he faced as a young member of the church, touching on the social norms that guided everyday life and the ways in which questioning or deviating from the established beliefs was often met with resistance. He describes how the church\u2019s teachings permeated all aspects of life, from schooling to social interactions, creating an environment where adhering to the group\u0027s standards was seen as crucial for spiritual well-being. As the conversation unfolds, Nolan recounts the internal struggle he experienced when his personal beliefs began to diverge from those of the church. He discusses moments of doubt, the fear of disappointing loved ones, and the difficulties of reconciling his own questions with the teachings he was raised to accept without hesitation. These conflicts eventually led him to step away from the Holdeman faith, a decision that came with both loss and newfound freedom. Nolan also shares the challenges of adjusting to life outside the church, where navigating a world with different social norms, customs, and even dress codes was unfamiliar. He reflects on the process of building a new identity and forming relationships beyond the Holdeman community. Throughout the episode, Nolan\u0027s story is filled with moments of vulnerability, humor, and resilience, as he candidly talks about the ups and downs of transitioning from a life of rigid expectations to one of self-discovery. This episode not only provides a window into Nolan\u0027s personal journey but also explores broader themes of cultural conditioning, faith, and the search for meaning. It\u2019s a compelling look at how leaving a tightly controlled religious environment can affect one\u0027s sense of self and worldview, and what it means to find one\u2019s own path in life.

      "description": "The episode of Our People: Holdeman Mennonite Stories features Amanda as the host and Waylon as the guest. The discussion dives into the concept of spiral dynamics, a psychological model used to explain human development and behavior, especially in the context of religion.\n\nWaylon introduces spiral dynamics as a tool that has helped him understand why people react in different ways depending on their stage of psychological development. He emphasizes that the model is not hierarchical, meaning no level is inherently superior to another. Instead, each stage represents a necessary step in a person\u0027s journey.\n\nWaylon describes spiral dynamics as particularly useful in explaining behaviors within religious communities, such as the Holdeman Mennonites. He talks about how his understanding of this model has influenced his view of human interaction and the ways people respond to religious teachings and authority.\n\nThe conversation touches on the nuances of how spiral dynamics can shed light on the conflicts and challenges people face when trying to engage with or leave high-control religious environments. Waylon provides examples of how people within these communities are often at different psychological stages, which can lead to misunderstandings or friction, especially for those who are questioning or evolving beyond the traditional teachings of the church.\n\nAmanda guides the conversation, asking questions to clarify the model and its applications. The episode offers listeners insights into the complexities of human psychology within the context of faith and the Holdeman Mennonite experience.\nFollow us on Facebook:\nhttps://rb.gy/cj55td\nSubscribe on Spotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/show/1KwYkbtbIswUN3z6JSrqz5?si=0913b1c334724490\nSubscribe on YouTube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@OurPeoplePodcast?sub_confirmation=1\nSubscribe on Apple Podcasts:\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/our-people-holdeman-mennonite-stories/id1740613045\n\nAre you or is someone you know interested in sharing a story on the podcast?

      "description": "In this episode, titled \u0022Avoidance Kills: A Discussion With Mary Byler,\u0022 Amanda and Billy explore the impact of avoidance, a term used within the Church of God in Christ Mennonite for shunning. Mary Byler, founder of The Misfit Amish, discusses how the practice of avoidance, or shunning, within high-control Anabaptist communities perpetuates harm by isolating individuals and suppressing important conversations about abuse, trauma, and healing. Mary shares her personal journey of leaving a plain-dressing community and the work she now does to support others through her organization. She emphasizes how avoidance not only affects those who are shunned but also creates a culture where the most vulnerable are silenced. Throughout the episode, Mary discusses her advocacy work, which includes educating professionals like child advocacy centers on how to better serve survivors of abuse from these insular communities. This conversation sheds light on the psychological and emotional toll of avoidance, illustrating how it can cause lasting damage to individuals and communities. By tackling this issue head-on, Mary provides crucial insights into why addressing, rather than avoiding, these issues is vital for healing and justice.

      "description": "In this episode of Our People: Holdeman Mennonite Stories, our very own Amanda Esau takes the spotlight to share her personal journey, while being interviewed by Starla and Jordie. Born in Phoenix to a mixed-race family, Amanda opens up about the challenges she faced growing up with a Hispanic mother and a Caucasian father. She recalls how the cultural and racial differences were met with resistance within the Holdeman church, sharing a painful moment when her father was told, \u0022I guess somebody has to marry them,\u0022 a reference to their interracial relationship. Amanda walks listeners through her early years in Phoenix before moving at age 10. Her childhood story is a powerful reflection on navigating a rigid religious community as someone with a biracial background. Throughout the episode, she discusses how the church\u0027s racial biases and conservative values shaped her family dynamics and personal development. As the conversation progresses, Amanda reflects on her eventual departure from the Holdeman church. Her story touches on deep issues such as family loyalty, the challenge of questioning long-held beliefs, and the courage it took to break away from a restrictive environment. Her journey reveals the difficulties of reconciling faith with personal identity, and the often-overlooked experiences of people of color within such a homogenous church community. The episode ends on a hopeful note, with Amanda reflecting on the growth and freedom she found after leaving the church, and how her past shaped who she is today. Starla and Jordie offer thoughtful questions, making this episode an intimate and heartfelt exploration of identity, faith, and resilience.

      "description": "In this episode of Our People: Holdeman Mennonite Stories, hosts Weylin and Amanda sit down with Jaclyn (Jackie) Peachey to discuss her life journey, growing up within the Holdeman community and eventually finding her way out. Jackie opens up about her early life in Moundridge, Kansas, where her father left the family when she was just nine months old. She reflects on the strength of her mother, who went to nursing school and raised Jackie and her siblings on her own, becoming one of Jackie\u2019s greatest role models. Jackie talks about her family\u2019s move to Kidron, Ohio, when she was six years old, describing the community as somewhat closed off, rooted in an Amish-Mennonite background. However, her family ties in the area helped ease the transition, and Jackie shares her fondness for the close-knit environment, even though it could be isolating. The conversation turns more introspective as Jackie recounts her spiritual journey, including her struggles to fit in within the Holdeman church. She recalls feeling like an outsider, never quite connecting with the Holdeman way of life or understanding concepts like the Holy Spirit. This led to internal conflict, particularly after her baptism, when she initially felt a sense of joy but quickly slipped back into old behaviors, leaving her feeling guilty and disconnected. One pivotal moment in Jackie\u2019s story came when, at the age of 15, she and a close friend began to question whether the Holdeman church was truly the \u0022one true church\u0022 as they had been taught. Their exposure to conservative Mennonites and Amish communities sparked deeper questions about faith, belonging, and the truth of their religious upbringing. Jackie shares the challenges of navigating these doubts in a community where questioning was discouraged, and how it impacted her sense of identity. Throughout the episode, Jackie reflects on the difficulty of feeling like she had to present a false version of herself to fit in, and the relief and eventual growth that came with leaving the Holdeman church. Her story is one of resilience, self-discovery, and the courage to question long-held beliefs in the search for personal truth.

      "description": "In this episode of \u0022Our People: Holdeman Mennonite Stories,\u0022 Weylin sits down with Chris, a former member of a Central Kansas congregation of the Church of God in Christ Mennonite. Chris offers a candid look into her life, from growing up in a rural farming family to navigating her way out of the Holdeman church and redefining her beliefs. Chris recounts her childhood as the youngest of four daughters in a family that thrived on hard work and connection to the land. Her days were filled with farm chores, driving trucks during wheat harvest, and helping her father care for the animals. While she describes her upbringing as largely positive, she also touches on the underlying challenges, such as her family\u0027s financial struggles when a bad water well led to the loss of cattle\u2014a hardship that cast a shadow on her early years and taught her resilience. From an early age, Chris sensed that she was different. She was introspective and often found herself questioning the practices and teachings of the Holdeman church. This questioning nature set her apart and made her feel disconnected within the large congregation she was a part of. Chris shares her experience of being an introvert in a community that often felt overwhelming and how she found solace in her relationships with non-Holdeman relatives, which broadened her perspective and introduced her to ideas beyond the church\u2019s doctrines. Throughout the conversation, Chris delves into her psychological journey, detailing how she turned to various authors and teachers to explore new ways of thinking. She reflects on how her personality and experiences shaped her worldview, and how, over time, she began to see religion as often mirroring the personality of its founders\u2014a realization that prompted her to question the foundations of her faith even more deeply. Chris also speaks about the emotional and mental challenges of leaving the church, including the process of unlearning deeply ingrained beliefs and coping with the sense of loss that accompanies such a profound change. She emphasizes the importance of finding one\u0027s own path to healing and hope, sharing personal stories of growth and the small but significant steps she has taken toward reclaiming her sense of self outside the church. In this heartfelt episode, Chris opens up about her ongoing journey\u2014a journey that is not yet complete but is filled with determination and a desire for authenticity. Her story is a powerful reminder of the complexities involved in stepping away from a high-control religious environment and the courage it takes to pursue a life aligned with one\u2019s true values. Join Weylin and Chris as they explore the nuanced paths of questioning, leaving, and ultimately, finding peace beyond the confines of a close-knit religious community.

      "title": "The Holdeman Church Through the Post-War Period: A Time Of Change",
      "description": "In this episode, Caleb Jesser and Dennis Goossen take listeners through the transformative decades of the 1940s to the 1960s for the Holdeman Church, officially known as the Church of God in Christ, Mennonite. This episode is part of the series \u0022Our Heritage: Holdeman Mennonite History,\u0022 which explores the critical changes and developments that shaped the church during societal upheaval. The discussion opens with a reflection on the immediate post-war era. Caleb and Dennis provide context about how World War II\u0027s end brought significant changes globally and within the Holdeman community. They discuss how conscientious objectors returning from alternative service units brought back new perspectives, sometimes leading to tensions and debates within the church. These returning members had been exposed to broader societal norms and ideas, which sparked internal discussions about the community\u0027s engagement with the outside world and interpretations of core doctrines, including the church\u2019s emphasis on non-conformity to worldly practices. Moving into the 1950s, the conversation shifts to how the Holdeman Church responded to the rise of modernity and secularism. The hosts discuss the church leaders\u0027 concerns over the growing influence of radio, television, and other forms of media, which were viewed as potential threats to spiritual purity. These new technologies were believed to be gateways to worldly influences that could erode the community\u0027s values. As a result, church leadership enforced stricter guidelines and promoted a more insular approach to protect their members from perceived moral decay. As they explore the internal dynamics of the 1960s, Caleb and Dennis highlight the social and cultural shifts that impacted the Holdeman Church. This decade saw the church grappling with external pressures to modernize, which contrasted sharply with the desire to maintain traditional values. These discussions included debates on issues such as dress codes, musical influences, and levels of community involvement. These debates often created friction within the church, as some members pushed for a more adaptive approach while others sought to hold firmly to established traditions. A significant part of the episode covers the factions that split from the church during this time of change. Caleb and Dennis discuss various groups that broke away due to disagreements over doctrinal interpretations, lifestyle practices, or the church\u2019s stance on modern influences. These splits often came after prolonged periods of internal conflict and were marked by deep divisions within congregations, reflecting the broader struggle between maintaining doctrinal purity and adapting to a rapidly changing world. The episode also touches on the evolution of the church\u0027s governance and decision-making processes during this period. With the increasing complexities of managing a growing congregation, the church\u0027s leadership structure adapted to better address the diverse challenges faced by the community. This led to a more formalized approach to governance that continues to shape the church today. In closing, Caleb and Dennis reflect on how the post-war period up to the late 1960s was a pivotal era of change for the Holdeman Church, setting the stage for its future. The church\u0027s responses to both external and internal pressures laid the groundwork for its modern identity and practices. This episode provides a rich, detailed look at a crucial period in Holdeman Mennonite history, offering valuable insights into the community\u0027s struggles, adaptations, and steadfastness in faith.

Jordie shares candid reflections on her childhood, growing up first in Linden, Alberta, and later in Pincher Creek. She speaks warmly of her early years, recalling a childhood filled with love, family, and a sense of community. However, Jordie also opens up about the duality of her experience, where alongside the warmth and happiness, there was an undercurrent of fear deeply rooted in the church\u0027s culture. Jordie describes herself as a sensitive child who keenly felt the pervasive atmosphere of fear within the church environment. Despite the good memories, the fear she carried was something she internalized and never shared with others. Instead, she found solace in journaling and art, which became her private outlets for processing the complex emotions she experienced. As the conversation unfolds, Jordie delves into the nuances of her identity and the significant steps she took in reclaiming her life after leaving the church. She discusses her decision to change her name from Julie to Jordie, symbolizing a new chapter in her life and a break from the past. Through her story, Jordie offers listeners a profound insight into the challenges of growing up in a high-control religious environment and the journey of finding one\u0027s true self outside of it. This episode is a touching and relatable narrative for anyone who has grappled with the fear and expectations imposed by a strict religious upbringing. Jordie\u0027s story is one of resilience, self-discovery, and the power of creative expression in the face of adversity.

      "description": "In this episode of Our People: Holdeman Mennonite Stories, host Amanda sits down with Carolyn, who shares her deeply personal journey of growing up and living within the Holdeman Mennonite community. Carolyn\u2019s story is one of resilience, especially as she navigates the complexities of being a woman and a single mother in a patriarchal and high-control religious system. Carolyn begins by reflecting on her early years in Crooked Creek, where the church\u0027s teachings and sense of community provided her with a foundation. However, as she matured, she became increasingly aware of the strict roles imposed on women within the church. The expectations were clear: women were to be obedient, submissive and focused on homemaking and child-rearing. Carolyn describes the immense pressure to conform to these roles, which left little room for personal growth or autonomy. As a single mother, Carolyn faced additional scrutiny and judgment from the church staff and the broader community. She recounts how her status as a single mother was often viewed with suspicion, as though it signified a failure to adhere to the church\u2019s standards of marriage and family life. The lack of support for single mothers within the church only exacerbated the challenges she faced, leaving her to navigate motherhood largely on her own while still trying to meet the church\u2019s demanding expectations. Carolyn also speaks candidly about her interactions with church and school staff, who often reinforced patriarchal norms that kept women like her in subservient positions. She shares instances where she felt marginalized and disempowered by the male-dominated leadership, who were more interested in maintaining control than offering compassion or understanding. The episode takes a significant turn as Carolyn questions the roles and expectations placed upon her. She reflects on the moment she recognized that her worth was not defined by the church\u2019s patriarchal standards but by her strength and values. This realization became a catalyst for her decision to leave the church and pursue a life where she could be true to herself and her children, free from the oppressive structures that had once held her back. Carolyn\u2019s journey is not just one of breaking free from a controlling religious environment but also a story of reclaiming her identity as a woman and a mother. Despite the emotional and societal challenges, she emerges with a profound sense of self-worth and a determination to provide a better life for herself and her children, outside the confines of the church\u2019s rigid doctrines. This episode offers a deeply moving exploration of the intersection between gender, religion, and personal freedom. Carolyn\u2019s story sheds light on the unique struggles faced by women and single mothers in high-control religious groups and underscores the courage it takes to defy patriarchal norms and forge a path of independence. Her testimony is a powerful reminder of the importance of self-empowerment and the strength that comes from breaking free of oppressive systems.

      "description": "In this episode of \u0022Our People: Holdeman Mennonite Stories,\u0022 Teran Rinehart shares the story of her life, focusing on her challenging experiences growing up in the Carson City, Michigan congregation of Church of God in Christ Mennonite and its school. Teran begins by recounting the remarkable story of her grandmother, who was born into a wealthy family in Santiago, Chile, but left it all behind to become a mail-order bride in Michigan. Yolanda\u0027s journey into the Mennonite community had a lasting impact on her family, including Teran. As Teran reflects on her upbringing, she opens up about the hardships she faced in the Holdeman church school. Teran describes how she was not well-liked and often felt miserable, struggling to make friends. The school environment was particularly difficult for her as a queer, autistic child, and she endured frequent bullying. Despite her intelligence, Teran found herself in a classroom where she was the oldest and often felt smarter than both her classmates and her teachers. She candidly discusses the inadequacies of the Mennonite teachers, many of whom only had an eighth-grade education and were more focused on finding a husband than on teaching. Teran\u0027s experiences were further compounded by the lack of support from the school staff, who failed to address the bullying she faced. She shares a particularly painful memory of a teacher dismissing her after she reported being physically abused at home, illustrating the broader issue of Mennonite teachers not complying with their legal obligations as mandatory reporters. The constant bullying and lack of support left Teran feeling like the laughingstock of the school, and these experiences had a lasting impact on her. Despite these challenges, Teran found solace in teaching Bible school, which became one of her biggest passions. She reflects on her attempts to be a \u0022good Mennonite,\u0022 actively participating in Sunday school and trying her best to fit in, even as she struggled with the rigid expectations of the church. This episode offers an honest and poignant look at the difficulties of growing up in the Holdeman Mennonite church, particularly within its educational system. Teran\u2019s story sheds light on the emotional toll of being a child in an environment where conformity was prized over individuality, and where support was often lacking. Her experiences provide a valuable perspective on the challenges faced by those who didn\u2019t fit the mold in a strict religious community, making this episode a powerful and eye-opening listen.

      "description": "In this episode of \u0022Our People: Holdeman Mennonite Stories,\u0022 we had the pleasure of sitting down with Wes Friesen from the Barron, Wisconsin congregation of Church of God in Christ Mennonite. Wes takes us on a journey through his life, sharing intimate and heartfelt stories about his upbringing, experiences within the church, and his eventual path out of the Holdeman community. Wes begins by recounting his childhood in Barron, Wisconsin, a place where he spent the majority of his formative years. He reflects on the strong sense of community and belonging that characterized his early life, describing the close-knit nature of the Holdeman Mennonite congregation and the deep-rooted traditions that shaped his worldview. Despite the warmth and support of the community, Wes also touches on the restrictive aspects of growing up in a high-control environment, where conformity and adherence to church doctrines were paramount. As Wes delves deeper into his story, he shares poignant anecdotes about pivotal moments in his life. He speaks candidly about the internal struggles he faced as he began to question the teachings and practices of the church. These moments of doubt and introspection eventually led him to seek a life beyond the confines of the Holdeman community. One of the most compelling parts of Wes\u0027s narrative is his account of the personal and emotional challenges he encountered during his transition out of the church. He talks about the feelings of isolation and the loss of familial connections that often accompany such a significant life change. Despite these hardships, Wes\u0027s resilience and determination shine through as he describes how he rebuilt his life, forging new relationships and finding a sense of purpose outside the Holdeman Mennonite faith. Throughout the episode, Wes\u0027s storytelling is infused with a mix of humor, reflection, and raw honesty. He shares lighter moments that highlight the quirks and idiosyncrasies of life within the church, providing listeners with a nuanced perspective on the Holdeman experience. At the same time, his more serious reflections offer a profound insight into the personal cost of leaving a high-control religious group. Wes\u0027s story is not just one of leaving, but also of growth and self-discovery. He talks about the newfound freedoms and opportunities he has embraced since leaving the church, and how these have allowed him to explore his own identity and beliefs. His journey is a testament to the strength and courage it takes to break away from a life that no longer aligns with one\u0027s values and to seek out a path that is true to oneself. In this episode, listeners are invited to witness Wes\u0027s transformation from a young boy in Barron, Wisconsin, to a man who has navigated the complexities of faith, community, and personal identity. His story is a powerful reminder of the resilience of the human spirit and the enduring quest for authenticity and freedom.

      "description": "In this episode of Our People: Holdeman Mennonite Stories, we are joined by Stuart Litwiller, who shares his profound journey from being deeply involved in Church of God in Christ Mennonite to building a new life in Kenya. Stuart starts by recounting his early years in Carson City, Michigan, and his move to Murray, Kentucky, where he took on significant leadership roles within the church.\n\nStuart\u0027s story takes a pivotal turn as he describes his baptism at age 13, which left him feeling unchanged and disconnected from the spiritual transformation he had expected. By age 16, Stuart was ready to leave the church altogether, feeling a strong desire to break away from the faith that no longer resonated with him. He candidly shares the moment when a fellow youth member\u0027s genuine concern led him to reconsider his decision and ultimately resulted in his excommunication.\n\nStuart\u0027s path back to the church was fraught with uncertainty, yet he persisted in his search for spiritual fulfillment. His interactions with a man who would later become a minister, Tim Buck, were instrumental in his journey back to the church, where he was eventually reaccepted. Despite this, Stuart\u0027s spiritual journey continued to evolve, leading him to significant life changes.\n\nStuart recounts a cycle of excommunications and reacceptances, reflecting a continuous struggle with his faith. He shares how, at age 18, he enjoyed attending classes but found it difficult to return home, leading to another excommunication. This pattern repeated, with Stuart being reaccepted and then excommunicated again at age 22, shortly after his marriage.\n\nDespite managing to stay in the church until age 49, Stuart reveals that he never truly felt assured of his salvation or experienced the grace he sought. His final departure from the church was catalyzed by a disagreement with his wife over refinancing their debt, which escalated and involved church deacons. During a revival, Stuart was confronted by church leaders who suggested he was born again but never truly converted, leading to his excommunication.\n\nFeeling disillusioned, Stuart attempted to rejoin the church but ultimately decided to pursue a different path. He relocated to Katali, Kenya, seeking a fresh start. Stuart delves into the challenges and rewards of adapting to a new culture and building a new community. His resilience and determination shine through as he reflects on his journey from excommunication to establishing a fulfilling life in Kenya.\n\nListeners will be inspired by Stuart\u0027s story of leaving behind a restrictive religious environment, overcoming personal and spiritual struggles, and finding a new sense of purpose and community in Kenya.

Monica shares her early life on a Canadian farm and the predestined path to her baptism at age 14 into this deeply traditional Holdeman Mennonite community. As she grew older, critical events\u2014including the tragic death of peers and a family move\u2014spurred profound shifts in her beliefs and feelings toward her faith. Monica candidly discusses the pressures and struggles that came with conforming to church expectations, her battle with mental health, and the eventual, liberating decision to leave the church. This episode, \u0022A Voice from Carrot River,\u0022 explores Monica\u0027s journey of self-discovery, her efforts to redefine her spirituality, and the ongoing process of healing from religious trauma.

      "description": "In this episode of the Our People Podcast, titled \u0022Cam\u0027s Story of Building an Honest Life,\u0022 we delve into the life journey of Cam Isaac. Now residing in northern Alberta, Canada, Cam reflects on his life\u0027s narrative, emphasizing his evolution from adhering to external expectations to embracing a life grounded in honesty and self-acceptance. Raised in the deeply rooted Holdeman mennonite farming congregation in Crooked Creek, Alberta, Cam shares his upbringing in a congregation with a legacy spanning nearly a century. He discusses the complexities of growing up as the eldest child in a Holdeman community, where he adopted the \u0022good boy\u0022 persona to secure approval and avoid conflict. However, this facade led him to a cycle of dishonesty\u2014masking his true self to fit the mold expected by the church, his community. Cam\u2019s turning point came with his decision to leave the Holdeman faith, a move that reshaped his relationships and his sense of self. He openly discusses the challenges and liberation that came with breaking free from the religious and social expectations that had defined much of his life. This journey of self-discovery is punctuated by his diagnosis of cancer and a heart condition, which he sees not as a setback but as an opportunity for profound personal growth and reassessment of his life\u2019s priorities. Throughout the episode, Cam emphasizes the power of authenticity, the peace that comes with living true to one\u0027s self, and the importance of unconditional love, even when it means standing alone. His story is a testament to the strength found in vulnerability and the transformative power of living a life aligned with one\u0027s deepest truths.
