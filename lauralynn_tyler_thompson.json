      "description": "Daystar Pete\u2019s Forensic Examiner Speaks Out\r\nPete tried repeatedly to get Denise Boggs to clear him from SA allegations against a child. However, he refused to meet with forensic examiner Debbie Leonhardt for further investigation to clear up the accusations against him. Pete said Debbie Leonhardt\u2019s questions were gruelling and refused to come back on his own. Rachel Lamb Brown reported that Pete and his wife were exonerated and spoke with Marcus Lamb the day of his interview. Debbie Leonhardt sheds light on what really happened.\r\nSun City Silver and Gold: sovereignize@protonmail.com\r\nZstack Protocol: https://zstacklife.com/?ref=LAURALYNN \r\n     \u2606 We no longer can trust our mainstream media, which is why independent journalists such as myself are the new way to receive accurate information about our world.
