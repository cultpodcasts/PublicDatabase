Older:\n\n\u201CWe are still not allowed to put on a defense?\n\n\u201CYou won\u2019t outlive that, old man \u2014 dad \u2014 hey, dad \u2014 look at the truth over here \u2014 hey!\u201D\n\nOlder ordered removal of the defendants and as he was being led away, he said, \u201CYou will not outlive that, old man.\u201D\n\nThe seven men and five women in the regular jury panel filed into the courtroom at 11:42 a.m. after nearly 43 hours of deliberation on nine days. They wore sober expressions but were not grim.\n\n\u201CMr. Tubick, has the jury reached a verdict?\u201D Older asked Herman C. Tubick, the foreman.\n\n\u201CYes, you honor, we have,\u201D the mortician replied.\n\nOlder took several minutes to check the order of the verdicts, then asked the clerk, Gene Darrow, to read them.\n\nWhat he read amounted to this: Manson, 36, Susan Atkins, 22, and Patricia Krenwinkel, 23: Guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to murder in the deaths of Sharon Tate, Abigail Folger, Voltyck Frykowski, Thomas John (Jay) Sebring, Steven Earle Parent and Leno and Rosemary La Bianca on Aug. 9-10, 1969.",
