      "description": "We all wake up for different reasons. We all were impacted by certain things on the way to us totally freeing ourselves of JW propaganda. Here\u2019s how the 2018 \u201CBe Courageous\u201D Regional Convention helped to plant seeds of doubt in my mind.\n\nBy the way here are some other ex-jw youtubers who I really enjoy, and recommend:\n\nCindy Lu Who?: https://youtu.be/0cY_nlzfDr0\n\nDiary of an Awkward Ex-JDub Mum: https://youtu.be/MQ_BErybbdM\n\nLew Night: https://youtu.be/HMPNYFtdjQw\n\nChessa Manion: https://youtu.be/_5j4rFQFSwY\n\nMentally Diseased: https://youtu.be/YoZg781tGvM\n\nFair Use Note: All statements made in this video are only my personal opinion as a former member of the Jehovah\u0027s Witness religion.

      "title": "Ex-Jehovah\u2019s Witness Elder explaining why my family and I left the Watchtower Organization",
      "description": "I\u2019m Matt. A former Jehovah\u2019s Witness Elder, Regular Pioneer, Service Overseer, Convention Speaker, Convention Department Overseer, etc. \n\nI list all of those JW titles not to brag, but to emphasize that I did plenty for the WT organization and I have specific, first-hand knowledge of how it generally works on a local, circuit and convention level. \n\nBut even after working toward all of those goals, my family and I decided to leave the organization. I had specific doubts, that when I finally investigated them, proved what I had feared...I wasn\u2019t in \u201CThe Truth\u201D.\n\nMy four big issues that lead me personally (seperate from my wife\u2019s doubts and issues with JW\u2019s) to leave were:\n\n1. No longer believing in a \u201Choly spirit\u201D, or that it guides the organization. Based on personal experiences, the stories and experiences of others, and general critical thinking.\n\n2. The systemic child sexual abuse in the organization, and the impotent response and safeguards of the organization to prevent it. Along with the refusal at times to work with authorities, and the refusal to submit the information gathered on the pedophiles in the organization.\n\n3. The rampant sexism and misogyny in the bible and in the organization.\n\n4. The scientific inaccuracies in the bible. Chief among them, the fallacy of humans only existing for a little over 6,000 years. \n\nMy goal is not to bash rank \u0026 file JW\u2019s, nor to bash Christians or those who are Theists in general. I\u2019m just here to tell my story and give my personal thoughts. I hope that those who are active Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, and those who formerly considered me a friend when I was in the organization view this video, and do so with an open mind and an open heart. \n\nBut I truly want to be a voice for those who maybe are also ex-witnesses, or those who might be PIMO (physically in, mentally out), and want to hear about someone else who had doubts, and realized that they weren\u2019t part of an honest organization.\n\nPlease, do not fear the men making decisions for the Watchtower Organization. They have no proof, and cannot prove they have any divine insight. So I recommend strongly that you do unbiased and objective research on the Jehovah\u2019s Witness religion. Do not be afraid to read or view information outside of their tyrannical hold. Free your mind, and search for real truths, ones that can be proven and stand up to scrutiny.\n\nThank you for taking the time to watch.",
