This is a platform where people can share their ideas anonymously.\n\nI would like to thank the Reddit user \u201Cscj_love\u201D for providing criticism on my video regarding Revelation 7. He also later created an illustration to explain the new additions to Revelation 7. To see the various discussions that he has had with current and former members and leaders, please check out the links in the description below.\n\nHad some SCJ members question where I learned that according to SCJ\u0027s interpretation, it is not possible for the Great Tribulation to even start until the 144,000 are completely sealed.

Note that this is merely a summary of what happened and contains very general information. I will progressively explain the specific detail. \n\nI apologize for the bad quality video and sound, I will improve my set up over time. I am new to this so please bear with me.\n\nHere are some of the books I referred to in my video.\n\nhttps://www.criticalthinking.org/store/\nhttps://rowman.com/ (other online store that sells their books)\n\n1. Thinker\u0027s Guide to the Human Mind: Thinking, Feeling, Wanting, and the Problem of Irrationality\n2. The Miniature Guide to Critical Thinking Concepts \u0026 Tools\n3. The Thinker\u0027s Guide to Fallacies: The Art of Mental Trickery and Manipulation\n4. The Thinker\u0027s Guide to Socratic Questioning\n5. The Thinker\u0027s Guide to Ethical Reasoning\n6. Fact over Fake: A Critical Thinker\u0027s Guide to Media Bias and Political Propaganda\n\nThese are all short books that can be read. However, if you would rather want to read one complete book then I would recommend the following book:\n\nCritical Thinking: Tools for Taking Charge of Your Professional \u0026 Personal Life - Second Edition\n\nhttps://www.criticalthinking.org/store/products/critical-thinking-tools-for-taking-charge-of-your-professional-amp-personal-life/145\n\nhttps://rowman.com/ISBN/9781538139523/Critical-Thinking-Tools-for-Taking-Charge-of-Your-Professional-and-Personal-Life-Second-Edition\n\nIf you don\u0027t have the money and time to buy and read these books then you can consider the Thinking is Power website to learn about the basics of critical thinking (https://thinkingispower.com/foundations-in-critical-thinking/).",
