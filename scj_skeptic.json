Note that this is merely a summary of what happened and contains very general information. I will progressively explain the specific detail. \n\nI apologize for the bad quality video and sound, I will improve my set up over time. I am new to this so please bear with me.\n\nHere are some of the books I referred to in my video.\n\nhttps://www.criticalthinking.org/store/\nhttps://rowman.com/ (other online store that sells their books)\n\n1.

Fact over Fake: A Critical Thinker\u0027s Guide to Media Bias and Political Propaganda\n\nThese are all short books that can be read.
