      "description": "A 20 year member of the Westboro Baptist Church and eventual primary spokesman and elder repented and came to Christ. This documentary is part confession, part expose and completely saturated with the Gospel...The power of God in Christ is great to save, as the Son of Man was sent to seek and to save the lost. Nowhere is this world is beyond the grasp of Christ\u0027s love to cleanse and change a heart - reconciling that soul to God. Even cloistered amongst a reviled group of legalistic, misguided zealots who had already convinced themselves that they alone knew and proclaimed the truth of God and all other churches were wicked - the Savior can deliver a vain man from the self-serving, self-righteous grip of doctrinal distortion -  being drawn into loving union in Christ by the everlasting chords of kindness of our merciful Father. This doc marks such a deliverance.",
