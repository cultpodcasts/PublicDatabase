      "description": "USA LIVE: Democratic Women\u2019s Caucus holds news conference with Epstein survivors | CNBC TV18\nMore than 20 victims of Jeffrey Epstein urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to respond to multiple questions about the exposure of victims\u2019 information and inconsistent redactions in the Justice Department\u2019s release of millions of files related to the late convicted sex offender.\nThe letter, which came as Bondi was set to testify before Congress on Wednesday, includes a list of 14 questions about the department\u2019s review of the documents, adding that for victims of Epstein, the release \u201Cremains incomplete in a way that is both staggering and indefensible.\u201D\nNews conference with members of the Democratic Women\u2019s Caucus, House Judiciary Committee Democrats, House Oversight Committee Democrats, and Epstein survivors ahead of Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s appearance at a House Judiciary Committee hearing\nWASHINGTON, DC - Senator Chuck Schumer ,along with survivors of Jeffrey Epstein, unveil \u201CVirginia\u2019s Law\u201D legislations that aims to eliminate statute of limitations for sex traffickers and abusers.\nLawmakers tried Monday to interview Ghislaine Maxwell, but the former girlfriend and confidante of Jeffrey Epstein invoked her Fifth Amendment rights to avoid answering questions that would be incriminating.\nGhislaine Maxwell has invoked her Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination in her ongoing deposition with the House Oversight Committee, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nMaxwell, Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s accomplice, is appearing before the panel virtually. She is currently serving time at a minimum security prison in Bryan, Texas.\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is facing bipartisan calls to resign after he appeared in a recent batch of files linked to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) accused Lutnick in a statement Monday of having \u201Clied\u201D about the extent of his connection to Epstein. Lutnick has sought to downplay their relationship, saying in a podcast appearance last year he vowed in 2005 to never again be in the same room as Epstein.\nReps. Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie are challenging the Justice Department for redacting the names of six men in the publicly released materials related to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein \u2014 and they could take matters into their own hands to reveal their identities.\nMaxwell was questioned during a video call to the federal prison camp in Texas where she\u2019s serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. She\u2019s come under new scrutiny as lawmakers try to investigate how Epstein, a well-connected financier, was able to sexually abuse underage girls for years.\nThe deposition came on the same day that the Department of Justice has begun allowing members of Congress to review unredacted files related to Epstein files, according to a letter that was sent to lawmakers. The ltter, obtained by The Associated Press, says they can come to the Justice Department with 24 hours notice and review the more than 3 million files without redactions. They can\u2019t bring anyone with them, and can take notes but not make electronic copies.\n#ghislainemaxwell #epsteinfiles #uscongress #jeffreyepstein #cnbctv18 #usatoday #livenews",
