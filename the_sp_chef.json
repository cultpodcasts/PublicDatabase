It is a simple recipe that uses some melted chocolate and left overs from your cupboard like nuts,dried fruits, cookies and such.\r\nI will be using 400g/14oz of melted chocolate\r\nAnd a dish with the capacity of about 800ml/28oz\r\nFor the other ingredients you may choose yourself the amount and what \r\nyou want to put in it.\r\nBut it is important, that you do not add too much, otherwise the \u00B4\u00B4cake\u0060\u0060 will fall apart.\r\n\r\nWhile I am preparing it, you may ask me any question that I will be answering during my preparation of the dessert and after it.",

      "description": "During my time in the Sea Org, working in Scientology I was stationed at the Stables in St. Hill, England (from 2008-2012). There I ran the staff canteen and eventually worked fully in the kitchen cooking the food for the staff.\nThe statistics to determine weather you cooked well was decided on a simple point system that each Sea Org member would have to fill out to show their satisfaction with the food. Then at the end of the week it would be counted all together and that determined the statistic of the staff cook.\nNaturally, many people ended up not voting as they just couldn\u0027t be bothered with it. So I came up with the idea of gently persuading them to do so, by bribing them with cookies. And here I show you how I made the persuasion cookies.\n\nThese are the Ingredients that you will need to make between 18-20 cookies:\n175g/6oz of soft margarine\n225g/8oz of caster sugar\n2 medium eggs\n350g/12oz of either self-raising flour, or 350g/12oz of regular flour with 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder.\n50g/2oz of chocolate chips\n20g/1oz of oats\n30g/1.5oz of walnuts\n\nPlease make sure to preheat your oven to 180\u0027C/350\u0027F and bake the cookies for 15-20 minutes.\n\n\nHere you can find the Interview that Jeff did with me:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3MgHAFD4Q\u0026t=7111s\n\nIf you\u0027d like to get in touch with me directly, then please write me at\nthespchef@gmail.com",
