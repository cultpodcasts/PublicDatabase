      "description": "Today I am protesting the abuses of Scientology at the European headquarters of Scientology, which is in Kopenhagen Denmark. Having grown up and worked for Scientology, I am here today to protest this so called \u201Cchurch\u201D ( though not recognised as such in most EU countries including Denmark) and speak of my experience and talk about the policies that are part of the doctrine of Scientology.\n\nIf you wish to make a donation, then please consider the charities that help and support ex Scientologists and those seeking to help get their loved once out of it:\n\nThe Aftermath foundation: https://www.theaftermathfoundation.org/\n\nSPTV Foundation: https://sptvfoundation.org/\n\nThere is a wonderful web sight called fsciento, which shows all the different channels that talk about and protest Scientology. It is a great resource for information on the subject of Scientology. I would appreciate it, if you would go there and if you found it helpful, to leave a donation for the creators of the website who take a lot of time, effort and money to keep the sight up to date and as informative as it is: https://fsciento.space/\n\nPlease give this video a thumbs up and consider subscribing to my channel.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnF_3vyNRUzyw-uftBQ5wvA?sub_confirmation=1\n\nIf you\u0027d like to get in touch with me directly, then please write me at\nthespchef@gmail.com\n\nIf you\u0027d like to support me in a more financial way, then please consider becoming a channel member, thank you indeed darling:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnF_3vyNRUzyw-uftBQ5wvA/join\n\n@fciento @scientology @protest @ Denmark @kopenhagen @exscientologist @cult",

      "description": "In this video I talk about an aid that I have made for myself for when  am out protesting Scientology. I hope you find it helpful and informative. Here is the  text which is on the cards:\n\nON CHILDREN\nThe 7yr old girl who shudders because a man kisses her is not computing; she is reacting to an engram since at 7 she should see nothing wrong with a kiss, not even a passionate one.\nDIANETICS The Modern Science of Mental Health\n\nChildren are beings and are to be treated as such. They work in the division of the Org and come under the Sea Org Staff Member. They are to be given posts, stand watches and are provided uniforms.\nFLAG ORDER 485 7.03.1968\n\nEvery Sea Org Member must be included on the W.Q.S.B. and Org Board regardless. Age 6 and above.\nFLAG ORDER 780 29.05.1968\n\nWQSB \u2013 Watch Quarter Station Bill. This is a large chart that is located in Sea Orgs that lists out where each person lives, what their cleaning station is, weather they are on port or starboard watch, and any number of other details about the person.\n\nON LEAVING SCIENTOLOGY\nIn Scientology we have the phenomenon of preclears in session or students on courses deciding to leave and never coming back. And that gives us more trouble than most other things all combined\u2026\n\nPeople leave because of their own overts and withholds. That is the factual fact and the hardbound rule. A man with a clean heart can\u2019t be hurt\u2026\n\nThe answer lies in Scientology and processing the person up to a high enough responsibility to take a job or a position and carry it out without all this weird hokus-pokus of \u2018I\u2019ve got to say you are doing things to me so I can leave and protect you from all the bad things I am doing to you\u2019. That\u2019s the way it is and it doesn\u2019t make sense not to do something about it now that we know.\n\nA recent Secretarial Executive Director to all Central Organizations states that before a person may draw his last pay cheque from an Organization he is leaving of his own volition he must write down all his overts and withholds against the Organization and its related personnel and have these checked out by the HCO Secretary on an EMeter. To do less than this is cruelty itself.\nHCOB 31.12.AD9 (1959) HAS! Dept Heads BLOW-OFFS\n\nThe suppressive person (whom we\u2019ve called a Merchant of Fear or Chaos Merchant and which we can now technically call the suppressive person) can\u2019t stand the idea of Scientology. If people became better, the suppressive person would have lost. The suppressive person answers this by attacking covertly or overtly Scientology.\n\nBut where the student leaves the premises in a blow or doesn\u2019t turn up for class, the Tech Division must send an instructor and the student\u2019s auditor over to HCO Department of Inspection and Reports. An HCO representative should go with them at once to pick up the student. \nHCOPL 5.04.1965 HCO Sec Hat HCO JUSTICE DATA RE ACADEMY \u0026 HGC\n\nWhen you get in Ethics the decent one raises his necessity level and measures up. The suppressive type blows (leaves).\nHCOPL 1.10.1967 Admin know-how uses of orgs\n\nON FAIR GAME\nBy FAIR GAME is meant, may not be further protected by the codes and disciplines of Scientology or the rights of a Scientologist.\n\nThe families and adherents of Suppressive Persons or Groups may not receive processing. It does not matter weather they are or are not Scientologists. If the families or adherents of Suppressive Persons or Groups are processed, any auditor doing so is guilty of a misdemeanor. (See HCO Policy Letter of 7 March 1965, Issue II Suppressive acts suppression of Scientology and Scientologists).\nThe fair game law HCO PL 23.12.1965\n\nSP Order. Fair Game. May be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist. May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed.\nPenalties for lower conditions HCO PL 23.12.1967\n\nThe practice of declaring people FAIR GAME will cease. FAIR GAME may not appear on any Ethics Order. It causes bad public relations. This PL does not cancel any policy on the treatment or handling of an SP.\nCancellation of fair game HCO PL 21.10.1968\n\nUNFORTUNATELY, I AM LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF CHARACTERS, THAT I CAN ADD IN THE DESCRIPTION, WHICH IS WHY THE REST OF THE TEXT FOR THE CARDS YOU WILL FIND ON MY COMMUNITY POST.\n\nPlease give this video a thumbs up and consider subscribing to my channel.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnF_3vyNRUzyw-uftBQ5wvA?sub_confirmation=1\n\nIf you\u0027d like to get in touch with me directly, then please write me at\nthespchef@gmail.com\n\nIf you\u0027d like to support me in a more financial way, then please consider becoming a channel member, thank you indeed darling:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnF_3vyNRUzyw-uftBQ5wvA/join",

      "description": "In November/December 2023 I decided to talk about my upbringing in Scientology, having signed a contract at nine years old to work for the rest of my life for the Scientology elite group the Sea Org, joining that group, leaving it at age 20 and then slowly over the years waking up more and more of my indoctrination and brainwashing of it.\nI did so on Jeff\u0027s YouTube channel @ptsforlife  and there I told my story for the first time publicly and chronologically. I know, after I had done it, that my family members that are still involved in Scientology, would start to disconnect from me as they are not allowed to be in contact with anyone who dares speak out against Scientology, regardless weather they are family, friends or colleagues.\nIn March 2024 my sister and her husband disconnected from me and now on August the 3 my brother and seemingly my step-father have disconnected from me too.\n\n\nIf you\u0027d like to get in touch with me directly, then please write me at\nthespchef@gmail.com",

      "description": "During my time in the Sea Org, working in Scientology I was stationed at the Stables in St. Hill, England (from 2008-2012). There I ran the staff canteen and eventually worked fully in the kitchen cooking the food for the staff.\nThe statistics to determine weather you cooked well was decided on a simple point system that each Sea Org member would have to fill out to show their satisfaction with the food. Then at the end of the week it would be counted all together and that determined the statistic of the staff cook.\nNaturally, many people ended up not voting as they just couldn\u0027t be bothered with it. So I came up with the idea of gently persuading them to do so, by bribing them with cookies. And here I show you how I made the persuasion cookies.\n\nThese are the Ingredients that you will need to make between 18-20 cookies:\n175g/6oz of soft margarine\n225g/8oz of caster sugar\n2 medium eggs\n350g/12oz of either self-raising flour, or 350g/12oz of regular flour with 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder.\n50g/2oz of chocolate chips\n20g/1oz of oats\n30g/1.5oz of walnuts\n\nPlease make sure to preheat your oven to 180\u0027C/350\u0027F and bake the cookies for 15-20 minutes.\n\n\nHere you can find the Interview that Jeff did with me:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3MgHAFD4Q\u0026t=7111s\n\nIf you\u0027d like to get in touch with me directly, then please write me at\nthespchef@gmail.com",
