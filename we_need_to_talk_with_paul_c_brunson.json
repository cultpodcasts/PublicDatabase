      "title": "Rose McGowan \u201CHollywood Was Worse Than The Cult I Escaped\u201D",
      "description": "After being shut out of Hollywood, Rose McGowan explains how she was forced to step away - and slowly rebuild her life on her own terms. Rose speaks openly about her experiences in Hollywood, the cost of refusing to stay silent, and how leaving the industry became part of reclaiming her creativity, identity and sense of self. Rose was one of the first to go public with claims of sexual assault against Harvey Weinstein, and she explains how she was allegedly raped by the movie producer at the age of 23 - and what it cost her to speak out. She reflects on the severe personal and professional consequences that followed. Content warning: this conversation includes discussion of sexual assault. From being raised in a cult in Italy to navigating Hollywood, she reflects on how early experiences shaped her instincts around control, belonging and survival. She also speaks about what came after: the unexpected support she found through fans and Comic-Con, stepping away from the US to recover in Mexico, reconnecting with creativity through music, and why reclaiming her real name - Rosa - feels like coming home. She shares: \u25FD What it was like growing up inside The Children of God \u25FD Being alone at 13 and realising no one was looking for her \u25FD Why speaking out about Harvey Weinstein meant career death \u25FD What was really happening behind the scenes on Charmed \u25FD The truth behind the VMA dress and what people misunderstood \u25FD Nearly losing her life, leaving the US and starting again \u25FD How fans, creativity and music helped bring her back to herself Rose McGowan, We Need To Talk Support charities: Survivor\u2019s Trust: https://g2ul0.app.link/HOj44LvWZUb CALM: https://g2ul0.app.link/uULaUXcM3Nb MIND: https://g2ul0.app.link/gbuRaxjM3Nb Follow me here: https://www.instagram.com/needtotalk https://www.tiktok.com/@weneedtotalkpod Support Rose here: Website: https://www.rosemcg.com/ Instagram: www.instagram.com/rosemcgowan/ (00:00) Intro (02:23) How Does Rose Identify?
