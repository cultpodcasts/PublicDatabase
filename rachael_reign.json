We talk about what makes a church healthy or harmful, and how to spot the difference between faith that uplifts and control that breaks you down.\n\nAs a survivor, I believe these conversations matter \u2014 not just for healing, but for protecting the next generation. If you\u2019ve ever struggled with spiritual abuse, church trauma, or questioning your faith upbringing, this video is for you. \uD83E\uDDE1\n\n\u2728 Let me know in the comments: What would you want your children to understand about your story?\nAnd if you\u2019ve had to unlearn toxic teachings to find peace \u2014 you\u2019re not alone.\n\nSubscribe for more real talk on healing, faith, and freedom.\n\n#ChurchTrauma #SpiritualAbuse #CultSurvivor #FaithAndParenting #ToxicChurchCulture #GoodChurchBadChurch #DeconstructionJourney #ReligiousTrauma #TalkingToMyChild #HealingFromAbuse #survivinguniversaluk #ChristianCultAwareness #MotherhoodAndFaith #SurvivorVoices #ParentingAfterAbuse #HighControlGroups #rachaelreign",
