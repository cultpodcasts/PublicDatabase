For all things podcast tech help, do follow and contact Phil via Instagram @nonfunctionalharmony.\u00A0\n\n\u00A0\n\nThis is the episode I recorded with Laura weeks and weeks ago, but the audio had a terrible hum. It has been cleaned up, but you might find that speakers or headphones make for better listening.\u00A0\n\n\u00A0\n\nJoin Stella and Laura as they yap about cults: documentaries, why Laura doesn\u0027t like dramatisations, why we don\u0027t like the term \u0027brainwash,\u0027 and what you would exactly need to entice Laura into your cult.\u00A0\n\n\u00A0\n\nFollow The Murder Media Project on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, or email directly at murdermedia81@gmail.com, or visit the website https://murdermedia81.wordpress.com/\n\n\u00A0\n\nMusic:\n\n\u00A0\n\nCybertruck by Mood Maze\n\nMusic from #Uppbeat (free for Creators!):\n\nhttps://uppbeat.io/t/mood-maze/cybertruck\n\nLicense code: 2F2G6DAKEWYFVVC9\n\n\u00A0\n\nMusic from #Uppbeat (free for Creators!):\n\nhttps://uppbeat.io/t/matrika/neon-desert\n\nLicense code: VYEEJAZCIFRKWWPK\n\nAll music and trailer clips are used in the spirit of Fair Dealing (UK) and Fair Use (US Law).
