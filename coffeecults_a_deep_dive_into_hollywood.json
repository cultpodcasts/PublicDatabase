      "description": "Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis, Danny Masterson, Laura Prepon, Wilmer Valderrama \u0026 Topher Grace spent eight years starring in That 70\u2019s Show, one of the most successful shows of the late 90\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s. The  popularity of the show launched the six cast members from unknown actors to Hollywood stars. The cast of That 70\u2019s Show didn\u2019t just enjoy success for eight years, they all went on to established Hollywood careers, appearing in other tv shows, movies, hosting shows, streaming shows, collaborations, developing large social media followings, developing business and alleged charitable endeavours. But after decades of success today, the majority of the That 70\u2019s Show cast are more infamous than famous. Over the last few years the cast have disappeared from the spotlight, some taking a step back to avoid uncomfortable questions, some going into the Hollywood version of hiding, \u0026 some aren\u2019t even allowed to step foot in their own home ever again, never mind Hollywood. But unfortunately it looks as though several of the that 70\u2019s show cast are trying to force their way back into the limelight, no matter how much it costs. We\u2019ll also be discussing Danny Masterson\u2019s desperate attempts to try \u0026 escape his life sentence \u0026 the shattering of what remained of her personal life. Along with his and scientology\u0027s further legal battles, \u0026 how scientology is working around the clock and pouring a an absolute fortune into trying help him escape the consequences of his vile actions. So sit back, relax \u0026 let\u2019s dive into the latest chaos, career destructions \u0026 desperate attempts of the formerly famous \u0026 the now infamous cast of That 70\u2019s Show.

      "description": "Ashton Kutcher \u0026 Mila Kunis have had successful television \u0026 film careers for over 25 years, starting their careers playing a fictional couple Michael Kelso \u0026 Jackie Burkhart respectively on That 70\u2019s show. But after making it to the A List \u0026 making an absolute fortune, in September 2023, they experienced one of the most talked about downfalls in Hollywood history \u0026 all because of their own actions related to their That 70\u0027s Show co star \u0026 best friend, Danny Masterson. They thought their behaviour would remain secret \u0026 the public wouldn\u0027t find out. But what a lot of people don\u2019t know about Ashton Kutcher \u0026 Mila Kunis is that there are a lot more extremely questionable actions that they HAVE kept covered up \u0026 secret for years, esp when it comes to the company that has spent almost two decades laundering Ashton \u0026 Mila\u0027s reputation, the charity Thorn, a charity that allegedly helps exploited children, well... that\u2019s what Ashton \u0026 Mila claim anyway. But there is so MUCH MORE to Thorn than most people know, including strong personal \u0026 financial ties to Jeffrey Epstein, Harvey Weinstein, Danny Masteron \u0026 Sean Combs/ P Diddy, via Thorn\u0027s investments \u0026 Ashton Kutcher\u0027s friendships. There\u0027s also a LOT more to discuss with the plethora of other businesses Ashton Kutcher is involved with, a few successful, many bonfires of cash but all with questions surrounding them. Along with a deep dive into Thorn \u0026 Kutcher\u0027s other businesses, we\u0027ll also be diving into their allegedly failing expensive \u0026 extensive mega PR strategy, which they\u2019ve been using to desperately try \u0026 claw back any shred of positive public opinion, \u0026 they\u0027ve now become so desperate, they are doing things they swore they never would. So sit back, relax \u0026 let\u2019s dive into the decay, the business \u0026 downfall of Hollywood\u2019s most controversial  couples, Ashton Kutcher \u0026 Mila Kunis.

The following year, his younger brother Chris Masterson also was cast in a hit Fox show, Malcolm In The Middle. The Masterson brothers had massive fame over the next several years, with both of their shows wrapping in 2006. Not too long after their success, their younger half siblings Alanna Masterson \u0026 Jordan Masterson found fame also, starring in The Walking Dead \u0026 Last Man Standing respectively.  Today however, the Masterson siblings are famous for a very different reason, for being Scientologists \u0026 Danny\u0027s horrendous crimes.

      "description": "Scientology has always made celebrities a priority, \u0026 for such a small religion, scientology does have a large amount of celebrity members. Everyone knows Tom Cruise \u0026 John Travolta are scientologists but what about the hidden and even secret members. Today many Hollywood scientologists hide their affiliation with the church, even lifelong members like Elisabeth Moss from the The Handmaid\u0027s Tale \u0026 Will \u0026 Jada Smith. There are also many celebrities who are connected to scientology, albeit not members, like Ashton Kutch \u0026 Mila Kunis. In today\u0027s video we\u0027ll be talking about all the hidden scientologists in Hollywood \u0026 some interesting things you might no know about these members. We\u2019ll also be exploring the most famous celebrity members and alleged members of scientology, such as John Travolta, Danny Masterson, Laura Prepon, Chris Masterson, Juliette Lewis, Will \u0026 Jada Smith, Elisabeth Moss, plus ex-member like Leah Remini, Nicole Kidman, Katie Holmes, John Stamos \u0026 many more. We\u0027ll also cover the many attempts Tom Cruise has made to draw other celebrities in, like David \u0026 Victoria Beckham Brad Pitt \u0026 many others.

      "description": "Laura Prepon moved to Hollywood in 1998 for her first ever role as the quintessential girl next door Donna Piccioti on That 70\u2019s Show. But while That 70\u2019s Show made Laura Prepon rich \u0026 famous beyond her dreams, it also introduced her to someone who brought a lot of darkness into her life, Danny Masterson. Laura Prepon \u0026 the rest of the That 70\u2019s Show cast with the exception of Topher Grace became extremely close with Masterson, \u0026 also saw him as their cliques leader, but Laura Prepon \u0026 Danny Masterson\u2019s relationship was much deeper than most of her costars. Through their friendship, Danny Masterson introduced Laura Prepon to the three biggest relationships of her life. Danny Masterson set Laura Prepon up with his brother Chris Masterson who has his own alleged dark history \u0026 when things didn\u2019t work out with Chris Masterson, Danny Masterson was also the one who introduced Laura Prepon to her ex-husband and father of her children Ben Foster. Danny Masterson is of course also responsible for introducing Laura Prepon to the controversial Church of Scientology. Laura Prepon was a very active member of the alleged cult for decades, but within weeks of Danny Masterson\u2019s arrest for multiple horrendous crimes, Laura Prepon claimed she was no longer an active scientologist. Laura Prepon refused to speak about her \u0026 her husbands still close ties to Danny Masterson, her exit from scientology or her alleged intimidation of dm\u2019s victims. Given Laura Prepon\u2019s silence on the subjects, some people thought op\u2019s silence meant she was distancing herself from dm, while many more came to the conclusion she maintained a friendship with dm but just not publicly. After Danny Masterson\u2019s sentencing in sept 2023 conversation around Laura Prepon and dm\u2019s relationship died down, but behind the scenes lp\u2019s relationship with dm was allegedly causing issues in her marriage, but not for the reasons you might think, as her now ex-husband ben foster is also a decade long friend of Danny Masterson\u0027s. Today we\u0027ll be covering everything about Laura Prepon, her \u0027exit\u0027 from scientology, her relationships with Chris Masterson \u0026 Ben Foster, her career \u0026 her messy divorce.

      "description": "Diddy \u0026 Jennifer Lopez were an item back in the late 1990\u0027s and early 2000\u0027s and during their relationship the both went through huge life altering moments. During their relationship Diddy helped J Lo break into the music scene and become a star. At the same time, Diddy \u0026 J Lo were involved in a sho*oting at Club New York just prior to New Years 1999. Both J Lo \u0026 Diddy were arrested \u0026 evidence \u0026 accusations stacked up, although surprisingly after a ling trial, Diddy walked away completely exonerated. This event went on to create headline after headline, \u0026 despite Combs was charged with serious crimes, J Lo remained loyal and by his side. J Lo has kept the details of that night a secret, \u0026 a lot of mystery remains around it still to this day, which is why we\u2019ll be taking a closer look at what really happened, because there is SO much more to the story of how Jennifer Lopez gained her enormous music career, her relationship with Combs \u0026 her career in present day.

      "description": "Diddy \u0026 Ashton Kutcher have been friends for over 20 years, \u0026 after Diddy\u0027s arrest, it seems Ashton Kutcher \u0026 his wife Mila Kunis are trying to distance themselves from any association with Diddy. Especially after the disaster filled year they just had after writing letters of support for convicted serial monster Danny Masterson. In the early 2000\u2019s, Diddy was already an a-lister, \u0026 while working on his hit show Making the Band with MTV, he met Hollywoods latest golden boy who also had a successful MTV show, Ashton Kutcher. Sean Combs \u0026 Ashton Kutcher created a fabricated story for how they met at MTV, but later in the video we\u2019ll discuss the alleged real story, as this encounter with Diddy would set up over 20 years of friendship \u0026 showed P Diddy that Ashton Kutcher, supported by his best friend Danny Masterson could keep a secret. Combs \u0026 Kutcher connected immediately, \u0026 Diddy enjoyed spending time with Kutcher so much, he started inviting him to do everything friends would do together \u0026 much more. \n\nINTRO: 00:00-00:01 00:02-03:04\nPART ONE: WHO ARE THE RAT PACK IN PRESENT DAY (CRIMES.

In this video we\u0027ll discuss everything from the foundation of Diddy \u0026 Kutcher\u0027s relationship, their partying rat pack, business endeavours and their connections in present day.

They\u0027ve been accused of brain washing, coercion, not paying people who work for them, forcing people to transition, telling their followers to stalk and harass their \u0027twin flame\u0027 \u0026 even telling people to violate restraining orders. Jeff and Shaleia are earning millions of dollars from their followers and all of the controversies surrounding them have caused the media to investigate their activity, journalists at Vanity Fair, Vice, and several others have dove into Jeff and Shaleia and Twin Flames Universe. In recent months, there has also been two docuseries released, Netflix\u0027s Escaping Twin Flames Universe \u0026 Amazon Prime\u0027s Desperately Seeking Soulmate - Escaping Twin Flames Universe. So today we\u0027ll be going over everything to do with Twin Flames Universe \u0026 the controversy surrounding Jeff and Shaleia - alleged coercion, brain washing, forced transition, not paying their workers, attempting to move all the followers to a privately purchased plot of land with hundreds of arches and so many other things. \nNOTE: This video is the result of research and everything is alleged and based on my personal opinion.\n\nIntro 00:00-00:01 00:02-02:05\nChapter One - What is Twin Flames Universe? 02:06-08:23\nChapter Two - Who Are Jeff \u0026 Shaleia? 08:24-17:37\nChapter Three -  Coaching, Courses \u0026 Bullshit 17:38-30:25\nChapter Four - Money, Control \u0026 Dangerous Mental Health \u2019Treatment\u2019 30:26-49:00\nChapter Five - TGolden Children \u0026 Coerced Transitions 49:01-56:49\nChapter Six - Former Members Stories 56:50-01:17:02\nChapter Seven - Twin Flames Universe Today 01:17:03-01:42:37\n\nSOURCES: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pwg0B6SmPBslORJ6PP7tvGfem83AlpjnqVzWRp-F6HM/edit?usp=sharing\nSpecial thanks (links to specific videos \u0026 channels in sources) to @letthefresherin , @lescomicmaker \n\n\u2714\uFEFF Second Channel - https://www.youtube.com/@UCh3o7rJe-xT1iYoPtjU37vQ \n\u2714\uFEFF TV Review Channel - https://www.youtube.com/@UCJCNGEYpTATKX55M5P_x3Dg \n\u2714 Social Media \nAshSilverInvestigates https://www.instagram.com/ashsilverinvestigates/ - Coffee \u0026 Cults Insta\nTheAshSilver https://www.instagram.com/theashsilver/ - Main Channel Insta\nTheAshSilver https://www.twitter.com/theashsilver/\nThe.Ash.Silver https://www.facebook.com/the.ash.silver/\n\u2714 Business Email - Ash.Silver2020@gmail.com\n\n#twinflamesuniverse #documentary",

In the early seasons of the show, the Browns tried to convince their audience that polygamy worked and that they were leading happy lives. Fast forward to today, and that premise has come crashing down, with three out of the four marriages failing and Kody barely speaking to any of his children. There\u0027s a lot of drama with Sister Wives, but also a lot of questionable behaviour, from predatory MLM\u0027s, money problems, the injuries and incidents that have happened to the kids on the show and just the all around awful behaviour by Kody Brown. Today we\u0027re going to be diving in to EVERYTHING you need to know about not only the Sister Wives show, but also the lives of Kody, Meri, Christine, Janelle and Robyn Brown outside of the show. I am also sitting down with some of the most beloved Sister Wives content creators towards the end of the video, so make sure you stick around for that!

He is also is best friends with his That 70\u0027s Show costars, Ashton Kutcher \u0026 Mila Kunis. Masterson may look to be another typical Hollywood celebrity, but behind the scenes he was attacking a large amount of women, many more than you\u2019ve heard about in the mainstream media. Danny Masterson, along with his siblings Chris Masterson (Malcolm in the Middle) \u0026 Alanna Masterson (The Walking Dead), is a lifelong member of the Church of Scientology. This case has had a lot of publicity because of the celebrities attached to it but unless you have been following this trial day after day from the people who were in court and following it all extremely closely, I think you\u2019ll be surprised by what really went on. The investigation took over seven years, and Leah Remini even put out a special episode of Leah Remini: Scientology \u0026 the Aftermath, covering Masterson\u0027s attacks on multiple women. This video will go over everything about Masterson, the accusations, trial, outcome, aftermath and more. Let me know your thoughts in the comments and a huge thank you to @GrowingUpInScientology who attended the Danny Masterson trial everyday and provided live updates throughout the trial.\n\n\u2714\uFEFF TV Channel - https://www.youtube.com/c/ashsilver\n\u2714 Social Media - AshSilverInvestigates \nhttps://www.instagram.com/ashsilverinvestigates/ - Coffee \u0026 Cults Insta\nTheAshSilver https://www.instagram.com/theashsilver/ \nMain Channel Insta\nTheAshSilver https://www.patreon.com/theashsilver/\nTheAshSilver https://www.twitter.com/theashsilver/\nThe.Ash.Silver https://www.facebook.com/the.ash.silver/\n\u2714 Podcast -  Drinks at Dana\u0027s - An L Word Podcast https://drinksatdanas.buzzsprout.com/\n\u2714 Business Email - Ash.Silver2020@gmail.com\n\u2714\uFEFF VPN Discount - Affiliate Link - https://www.expressvpn.com/ashsilver\n\ndanny masterson danny masterson documentary danny masterson trial danny masterson interview ashton kutcher mila kunis danny masterson ashton kutcher that 70s show church of scientology danny masterson conan danny masterson sentencing danny masterson and ashton kutcher danny masterson trial verdict danny masterson verdict danny masterson case danny masterson case explained danny masterson victim testimony scientology scientology explained leah remini scientology and the aftermath scientology leah remini ash silver coffee and cults\n\n#dannymasterson #scientology #documentary",
