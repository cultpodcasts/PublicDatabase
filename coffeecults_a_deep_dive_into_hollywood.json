      "description": "Danny Masterson became a star when he was cast as Steven Hyde on \nThat 70\u2019s Show alonside Mila Kunis as Jackie Burkhart , Laura Prepon as Donna Pinnicoti, Topher Grace as Eric Foreman, Ashton Kutcher as Michael Kelso \u0026 Wilmer Valderama as Fez. The following year, his younger brother Chris Masterson also was cast in a hit Fox show, Malcolm In The Middle. The Masterson brothers had massive fame over the next several years, with both of their shows wrapping in 2006. Not too long after their success, their younger half siblings Alanna Masterson \u0026 Jordan Masterson found fame also, starring in The Walking Dead \u0026 Last Man Standing respectively.  Today however, the Masterson siblings are famous for a very different reason, for being Scientologists \u0026 Danny\u0027s horrendous crimes. The Masterson\u0027s have been involved in everything from cheating, lies, diva behaviour to serious, disgusting crimes. In this video we\u2019ll be discussing everything about their behaviour, scandals, controversies, behaviour, crimes \u0026 more.

      "description": "Scientology has always made celebrities a priority, \u0026 for such a small religion, scientology does have a large amount of celebrity members. Everyone knows Tom Cruise \u0026 John Travolta are scientologists but what about the hidden and even secret members. Today many Hollywood scientologists hide their affiliation with the church, even lifelong members like Elisabeth Moss from the The Handmaid\u0027s Tale \u0026 Will \u0026 Jada Smith. There are also many celebrities who are connected to scientology, albeit not members, like Ashton Kutch \u0026 Mila Kunis. In today\u0027s video we\u0027ll be talking about all the hidden scientologists in Hollywood \u0026 some interesting things you might no know about these members. We\u2019ll also be exploring the most famous celebrity members and alleged members of scientology, such as John Travolta, Danny Masterson, Laura Prepon, Chris Masterson, Juliette Lewis, Will \u0026 Jada Smith, Elisabeth Moss, plus ex-member like Leah Remini, Nicole Kidman, Katie Holmes, John Stamos \u0026 many more. We\u0027ll also cover the many attempts Tom Cruise has made to draw other celebrities in, like David \u0026 Victoria Beckham Brad Pitt \u0026 many others. So sit back relax and let\u2019s dive in to the controversial, shocking and twisted world of the secret \u0026 hidden celebrity members of Scientology. \n\nSOURCES: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E0xE2vqMeZg2UNrZQ60RHtV6JjEVOkap9H1IteXJNts/edit?usp=sharing\nMY PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/coffeeandcultsextra/\nYOUTUBE MEMBERSHIP: https://www.youtube.com/@coffeeandcults/membership\nMy amazing editor Evelyn Dar\u2019s Channel https://youtube.com/@EvelynDar?si=D1J2FTMLSOP7g2AQ @EvelynDar \n\n*Second Channel - Coffee, Cults \u0026 Cats* (launching Summer 2025) https://www.youtube.com/@coffeecultsandcats\n*TV Channel* https://www.youtube.com/@AshSilver\n*Patreon* https://www.patreon.com/coffeeandcultsextra/\n*Insta* https://www.instagram.com/theashsilver/ \u0026 https://www.instagram.com/coffeeandcultsyt \n*Ms Gloria\u0027s Insta - https://www.instagram.com/MsGloriaTheCat/\n*Twitter* https://www.twitter.com/theashsilver/ \u0026 Facebook https://www.facebook.com/the.ash.silver/\nBusiness Email - Ash.Silver2020@gmail.com\n\nashton kutcher mila kunis  ash silver coffee and cults that 70\u2019s show Ashton Kutcher mila Kunis ash silver coffee and cults that 70\u0027s show that 90\u0027s show danny masterson ashton kutcher mila kunis wilmer valderrama topher grace scientology that 70s show  l danny masterson interview church of scientology victim testimony scientology scientology explained leah remini scientology and the aftermath scientology scientology tom cruise danny masterson leah remini that 70s show scientology exposed scientology documentary scientology explained scientology south park scientology cult scientology louis theroux tom cruise scientology tom cruise and katie holmes tom cruise and nicole kidman leah remini scientology leah remini and jennifer lopez church of scientology danny masterson trial ashton kutcher will smith south park katie holmes nicole kidman elisabeth moss nazanin boniadi and tom cruise nazanin boniadi scientology church of scientology scientologist scientology tom cruise danny masterson leah remini that 70s show scientology documentary scientology explained tom cruise scientology leah remini scientology church of scientology danny masterson trial ashton kutcher will smith elisabeth moss juliette lewis yellowjackets the handmaids tale mila kunis ashton and mila elisabeth moss scientologist will smith scientologist will and jada scientologist scientologist celebrity scientologist laura prepon\n\n#scientology   #ashtonkutcher   #elisabethmoss",

      "description": "Laura Prepon moved to Hollywood in 1998 for her first ever role as the quintessential girl next door Donna Piccioti on That 70\u2019s Show. But while That 70\u2019s Show made Laura Prepon rich \u0026 famous beyond her dreams, it also introduced her to someone who brought a lot of darkness into her life, Danny Masterson. Laura Prepon \u0026 the rest of the That 70\u2019s Show cast with the exception of Topher Grace became extremely close with Masterson, \u0026 also saw him as their cliques leader, but Laura Prepon \u0026 Danny Masterson\u2019s relationship was much deeper than most of her costars. Through their friendship, Danny Masterson introduced Laura Prepon to the three biggest relationships of her life. Danny Masterson set Laura Prepon up with his brother Chris Masterson who has his own alleged dark history \u0026 when things didn\u2019t work out with Chris Masterson, Danny Masterson was also the one who introduced Laura Prepon to her ex-husband and father of her children Ben Foster. Danny Masterson is of course also responsible for introducing Laura Prepon to the controversial Church of Scientology. Laura Prepon was a very active member of the alleged cult for decades, but within weeks of Danny Masterson\u2019s arrest for multiple horrendous crimes, Laura Prepon claimed she was no longer an active scientologist. Laura Prepon refused to speak about her \u0026 her husbands still close ties to Danny Masterson, her exit from scientology or her alleged intimidation of dm\u2019s victims. Given Laura Prepon\u2019s silence on the subjects, some people thought op\u2019s silence meant she was distancing herself from dm, while many more came to the conclusion she maintained a friendship with dm but just not publicly. After Danny Masterson\u2019s sentencing in sept 2023 conversation around Laura Prepon and dm\u2019s relationship died down, but behind the scenes lp\u2019s relationship with dm was allegedly causing issues in her marriage, but not for the reasons you might think, as her now ex-husband ben foster is also a decade long friend of Danny Masterson\u0027s. Today we\u0027ll be covering everything about Laura Prepon, her \u0027exit\u0027 from scientology, her relationships with Chris Masterson \u0026 Ben Foster, her career \u0026 her messy divorce.

During their relationship Diddy helped J Lo break into the music scene and become a star. At the same time, Diddy \u0026 J Lo were involved in a sho*oting at Club New York just prior to New Years 1999. Both J Lo \u0026 Diddy were arrested \u0026 evidence \u0026 accusations stacked up, although surprisingly after a ling trial, Diddy walked away completely exonerated. This event went on to create headline after headline, \u0026 despite Combs was charged with serious crimes, J Lo remained loyal and by his side. J Lo has kept the details of that night a secret, \u0026 a lot of mystery remains around it still to this day, which is why we\u2019ll be taking a closer look at what really happened, because there is SO much more to the story of how Jennifer Lopez gained her enormous music career, her relationship with Combs \u0026 her career in present day. It seems as though after decades of rudeness, poor treatment of others \u0026 horrendous behaviour, J Lo\u0027s past, actions \u0026 behaviour has finally caught up to her.

And while there\u2019s been some attempts to bury some clips \u0026 images we\u2019ll be looking back at many forgotten moments.

Especially after the disaster filled year they just had after writing letters of support for convicted serial monster Danny Masterson. In the early 2000\u2019s, Diddy was already an a-lister, \u0026 while working on his hit show Making the Band with MTV, he met Hollywoods latest golden boy who also had a successful MTV show, Ashton Kutcher. Sean Combs \u0026 Ashton Kutcher created a fabricated story for how they met at MTV, but later in the video we\u2019ll discuss the alleged real story, as this encounter with Diddy would set up over 20 years of friendship \u0026 showed P Diddy that Ashton Kutcher, supported by his best friend Danny Masterson could keep a secret. Combs \u0026 Kutcher connected immediately, \u0026 Diddy enjoyed spending time with Kutcher so much, he started inviting him to do everything friends would do together \u0026 much more. \n\nINTRO: 00:00-00:01 00:02-03:04\nPART ONE: WHO ARE THE RAT PACK IN PRESENT DAY (CRIMES. ALLEGATIONS \u0026 LIES): 03:05-59:08\nPART TWO: THE RAT PACKS HOLLYWOOD HEY DAYS: 59:09-01:47:23\n\nIn 2003 Combs also hit it off with Kutcher\u2019s best friend Danny Masterson \u0026 combined with Kutcher and Mastersons fellow That 70\u2019s Show costar, Wilmer Valderrama, Diddy formed a group with the three That 70\u2019s Show stars \u0026 put himself at the centre, P Diddy dubbed them the new Hollywood rat pack.  In this video we\u0027ll discuss everything from the foundation of Diddy \u0026 Kutcher\u0027s relationship, their partying rat pack, business endeavours and their connections in present day.

      "description": "Twin Flames Universe is a cult lead by Jeff and Shaleia Divine (previously Jeff and Shaleia Ayan \u0026 many other names). They\u0027ve been accused of brain washing, coercion, not paying people who work for them, forcing people to transition, telling their followers to stalk and harass their \u0027twin flame\u0027 \u0026 even telling people to violate restraining orders. Jeff and Shaleia are earning millions of dollars from their followers and all of the controversies surrounding them have caused the media to investigate their activity, journalists at Vanity Fair, Vice, and several others have dove into Jeff and Shaleia and Twin Flames Universe. In recent months, there has also been two docuseries released, Netflix\u0027s Escaping Twin Flames Universe \u0026 Amazon Prime\u0027s Desperately Seeking Soulmate - Escaping Twin Flames Universe. So today we\u0027ll be going over everything to do with Twin Flames Universe \u0026 the controversy surrounding Jeff and Shaleia - alleged coercion, brain washing, forced transition, not paying their workers, attempting to move all the followers to a privately purchased plot of land with hundreds of arches and so many other things. \nNOTE: This video is the result of research and everything is alleged and based on my personal opinion.\n\nIntro 00:00-00:01 00:02-02:05\nChapter One - What is Twin Flames Universe? 02:06-08:23\nChapter Two - Who Are Jeff \u0026 Shaleia? 08:24-17:37\nChapter Three -  Coaching, Courses \u0026 Bullshit 17:38-30:25\nChapter Four - Money, Control \u0026 Dangerous Mental Health \u2019Treatment\u2019 30:26-49:00\nChapter Five - TGolden Children \u0026 Coerced Transitions 49:01-56:49\nChapter Six - Former Members Stories 56:50-01:17:02\nChapter Seven - Twin Flames Universe Today 01:17:03-01:42:37\n\nSOURCES: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pwg0B6SmPBslORJ6PP7tvGfem83AlpjnqVzWRp-F6HM/edit?usp=sharing\nSpecial thanks (links to specific videos \u0026 channels in sources) to @letthefresherin , @lescomicmaker \n\n\u2714\uFEFF Second Channel - https://www.youtube.com/@UCh3o7rJe-xT1iYoPtjU37vQ \n\u2714\uFEFF TV Review Channel - https://www.youtube.com/@UCJCNGEYpTATKX55M5P_x3Dg \n\u2714 Social Media \nAshSilverInvestigates https://www.instagram.com/ashsilverinvestigates/ - Coffee \u0026 Cults Insta\nTheAshSilver https://www.instagram.com/theashsilver/ - Main Channel Insta\nTheAshSilver https://www.twitter.com/theashsilver/\nThe.Ash.Silver https://www.facebook.com/the.ash.silver/\n\u2714 Business Email - Ash.Silver2020@gmail.com\n\n#twinflamesuniverse #documentary",

In the early seasons of the show, the Browns tried to convince their audience that polygamy worked and that they were leading happy lives. Fast forward to today, and that premise has come crashing down, with three out of the four marriages failing and Kody barely speaking to any of his children. There\u0027s a lot of drama with Sister Wives, but also a lot of questionable behaviour, from predatory MLM\u0027s, money problems, the injuries and incidents that have happened to the kids on the show and just the all around awful behaviour by Kody Brown. Today we\u0027re going to be diving in to EVERYTHING you need to know about not only the Sister Wives show, but also the lives of Kody, Meri, Christine, Janelle and Robyn Brown outside of the show. I am also sitting down with some of the most beloved Sister Wives content creators towards the end of the video, so make sure you stick around for that!

He is also is best friends with his That 70\u0027s Show costars, Ashton Kutcher \u0026 Mila Kunis. Masterson may look to be another typical Hollywood celebrity, but behind the scenes he was attacking a large amount of women, many more than you\u2019ve heard about in the mainstream media. Danny Masterson, along with his siblings Chris Masterson (Malcolm in the Middle) \u0026 Alanna Masterson (The Walking Dead), is a lifelong member of the Church of Scientology. This case has had a lot of publicity because of the celebrities attached to it but unless you have been following this trial day after day from the people who were in court and following it all extremely closely, I think you\u2019ll be surprised by what really went on. The investigation took over seven years, and Leah Remini even put out a special episode of Leah Remini: Scientology \u0026 the Aftermath, covering Masterson\u0027s attacks on multiple women. This video will go over everything about Masterson, the accusations, trial, outcome, aftermath and more.

HEAVY SUBJECT MATTER*\nWelcome to a new video, today we are talking about the rise and fall of Allison Mack. Mack went from the star of a Disney Channel movie, to the lead on one of the first superhero shows on The WB, \u0026 later The CW, to second in command of a cult, NXIVM. Mack was second only to Keith Raniere, together they ran a pyramid scheme and then, a s*x cult. We are going over everything that happened on Mack\u0027s rise, her path at NXIVM, what happened after everything fell apart and how she became inmate no 90838-053.
