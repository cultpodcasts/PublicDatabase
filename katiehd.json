      "description": "trigger warning to anyone who is currently in the christian faith, this episode is nothing but talks about the anger and upset from things that i\u0027ve witnessed and experienced as a former church goer and pastors daughter, along with Logan and I decoding and explaining what we currently believe. If you are passionate about God, Christian faith, and church-- sit this one out. Truthfully, this episode is not meant for you, but rather an episode that can hopefully help some folks heal from any religious trauma.",
