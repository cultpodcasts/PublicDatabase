      "description": "Often, like in the case of the Momo Challenge, when parents freak out about a thing online, it\u2019s probably not really a thing. But, today we are talking about one panic that is real \u2014 \u201C764,\u201D the comm-network that is gamifying committing crimes and abuse. Joining us is Marcus Parks of The Last Podcast on the Left, to dive into this conspiracy that\u2019s more than a theory. Our guest Marcus Parks is a host of The Last Podcast on the Left , which is currently doing a miniseries on the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.
