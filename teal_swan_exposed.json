She has a penchant for applying many grandiose titles for herself, and by doing so, she exalts herself... just like a cult leader. If Teal applied only a handful of titles, it\u0027s likely no one would raise an eyebrow, however, when this is combined with the many other traits Teal displays, then it becomes problematic. The danger with this lack of humility and exaltation, is that it reinforces the cult leader and follower dynamic. \n\nRead the accompanying article here:\nhttp://www.tealswanexposed.com/2018/03/28/teal-swan-grandiose-titles/",

She has suggested to her followers that suicide is an option, while stating, \u201CI\u2019m not going to advocate for suicide.\u201D In response to this statement and more, read the Rebuttal to Teal\u2019s Suicide Segment in \u201CTeal Swan Answers Allegations\u201D video [https://bit.ly/2HdgIat]. She has used inappropriate and suggestive language to convince guests that they are unhappy living, she has glorified death and suicide, projected thoughts, feelings, and beliefs onto guests such as \u201CYou are not committed to life\u201D, and once joked about her first client\u2019s suicide that prompted the audience to laugh. As evidenced in Teal\u2019s Facebook group, Teal Tribe, many of her followers are suicidal [https://bit.ly/2EmU0tt], with no qualified training, and support experience - see Suicidal Posts for how Teal handles those who are suicidal in her group [https://bit.ly/2q8p8Zr]. Her teaching methods display her lack of degree, license, specialized training in trauma therapy, nor accountability. None of this behavior is \u201Crevolutionary\u201D as she likes to describe herself and her work, it\u2019s irresponsible, if not, dangerous. \n\nVideo Credit: The Suicide Catalyst / A.U.\n\nwww.tealswanexposed.com",

It is a \u201Ccombination of intentional manipulative conversational techniques that are designed to frustrate, confuse, and erode the sanity of the victim by getting them to question their perceptions of events, as well as their own judgment in general.\u201D (MacKenzie). Her guests are oftentimes left perplexed and sometimes even embarrassed and humiliated in front of hundreds of attendees. Teal\u2019s followers will confront those who question Teal\u2019s word salad by stating they just do not have a higher level of spiritual knowledge and understanding yet. Talk about divisive elitism. That should debunk the \u201Cteachings\u201D right there due to hypocrisy and contradictions. For examples of confused followers, watch her Synchronization Workshops",
