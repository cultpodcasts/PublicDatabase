      "title": "The Darker Side of Scientology - Tory Christman, Skepticamp LA 2024 Speaker",
      "description": "Even though Tory initially just wanted to leave the group as part of her past when she escaped in 2000, she knew she needed to help others escape, and to warn others about this destructive group.\n\nJoin Tory as she focuses on some of the abuses of Scientology that make it harder for members to leave, such as Scientology\u2019s standard of preventing members getting proper medical and mental health care, and threat of disconnection from family and friends being known examples.  Tory will also relate this to other high control groups using similar tactics.\n\nTory Christman is a former Scientologist turned outspoken critic of the Church of Scientology. Tory spent over 30 years within the organization before escaping in 2000. Since then, Tory exposes the harmful practices and policies of Scientology. She has become a prominent figure in the anti-Scientology movement, advocating for greater transparency and accountability from the organization. \n\nChristman has shared her experiences through interviews, public speaking engagements, and online platforms, aiming to raise awareness about the realities of Scientology. Her journey out of the organization has contributed to the broader discourse on the controversial practices of Scientology",
