      "description": "The Potter\u0027s House has received much criticism throughout it\u2019s existence and has been labelled by many as a cult. \r\n\r\nMajor areas of criticism include the level of control exerted over its members, the intense level of commitment required, and the shunning and mistreatment of those who have left the church.\r\n\r\nThe church has been accused of brainwashing its members resulting in the blind following of church beliefs and the division of families.\r\n\r\nAccording to their site they are an International Fellowship of over 3000 \u201Cchurches\u201D in 130 nations. The churches within The Fellowship are usually known as The Potter\u0027s House, The Door or Victory Chapel.\r\n\r\nAlan Eby knows firsthand the pain that takes place because he was once one of them.\r\nBirthed into this place during an April conference in Gallup, NM. He soon became a pastor\u2019s kid at only 6 years old. \r\n\r\nHe lived almost 30 yrs inside this place that has been branded a cult from professionals that study these type of high control systems. \r\n\r\nHe trained diligently to climb up the ladder to become a leader of his own church. The countless hours of non paid work for this place and at the end he says he\u2019s left with so much shame and regret for some of the actions he was persuaded and taught to proclaim and do. \r\n\r\nToday after finally walking away from The Potter\u2019s House after almost 30 years Alan is trying to further his career as an independent artist but says he suffers from feeling so behind then others in this industry because of so much wasted time he gave away to this so called church.\r\n\r\nAs he continues to heal from his experience inside The Potter\u2019s House Alan hopes by sharing his story that it will bring community and encouragement to others that have walked away from this same place. \r\n\r\nJoin me as Alan shares his story with Mandy exclusively on Mandy Speaks Up on Spotify, Apple Podcasts and YouTube!\r\n\r\n*You can support Alan on his newfound journey with his art at the links below: \r\n\r\nhttps://stormdreamer.threadless.com/\r\n\r\n*\r\nhttps://aeby530.wixsite.com/alanebycaricature-co\n\n*\n\nPiper and Bonnie\u0027s National Adventure https://a.co/d/g3nMDS9\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFind Mandy\u2019s personal story about escaping The Potter\u2019s House at the Spotify link\u2019s below:\r\n\r\nhttps://spotify.link/iQi0pSavjDb\r\n\r\n**\r\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/5DXDQIH8VMVsBkTu51LARQ?si=vKEucd5HTDqlwPKWtE_zOA\r\n\r\nSigns you are in a cult:\r\n\r\nhttps://centerofbalancecounseling.com/signs-you-are-in-a-cult/\r\n\r\n\r\nMandy Speaks Up Merch:\r\n\r\nhttps://mandy-speaks-up.myspreadshop.com/\n\nRESOURCES TO LEAVE A CULT or if you have:\nhttps://www.daretodoubt.org/cults\n\nPOST-CULT AFTER EFFECTS: https://www.spiritualabuseresources.com/articles/post-cult-after-effects\n\nTime stamp:\n0:00- 0:57 intro \n0:58- 1:31 First man \u0026 Alan\u2019s intro\n2:25- 2:57 Born into it \n3:27-4:09 Questioning \n5:47- 6:14 Allegations?\n6:16- 8:16 A pastors kid \n8:17- 8:54 Punishments \n8:58 - 11-21 Spanking, abuse of children \u0026 \u201Cthe book\u201D\n11:31- 13:43 Toxic masculinity \n13:44- 17:29 abuse, shunning, guilt tripping inside the church to create their culture \n17:30- 18:50 Love bombing \u0026 other cult tactics they use to keep you\n18:51 - 19:24 The fear of leaving \n19:25 - 21:00 \u201CReligious gang\u201D\n21:01- 22:11 misogyny \uFFFC\n22:12- 25:01 A pyramid scheme of money \u0026 power \n25:08 - 27:37 mental health, depression, anxiety are demonic \n27:38 - 28:57 Free labor and overwhelming amount of \u201Cchurch duties\u201D. \n29:58 - 31:59 Being a pastor is your only worth\n32:00-33:04 Men in a mental health crisis given no help only more duties \n33:05- 39:24 Feelings of regret, alter calls, shaming \u0026 bullying to convert \n39:25 - 43:01 Women \n43:02 46:08 What can happen inside a male \u201Cruled\u201D environment to the women \n46:09 - 51:58 A MUST LISTEN: They teach you to lie to yourself everyday!\n51:59 - 52:56 Leaving and rebuilding yourself \n52:57 - 1:02:59 How did Alan get through the fear and walk away.

She was married into it. \r\n\r\nAfter being forced to attend or be homeless, per request of her in-laws. She chose to attend. \r\n\r\nWhat she experienced in this horrific environment is something you would only imagine watching in a movie on t.v. \r\n\r\n* Viewer discretion is advised. *\r\nFrom physical violations (emotionally, physically, se*ually) to watching girls as young as 15 yrs old be married off. \r\nGrooming \u0026 manipulation, being isolated from \u201Coutsiders\u201D, to witnessing men that had accusations of terrible violations but still being allowed to become \u201Cpastors\u201D (cult leaders). And so much more. \r\n\r\nHow did she finally escape? \r\nIt wasn\u2019t until she did something that was not allowed that she was able to find the help to take the risk.\r\n\r\nJoin us as we chat with Christina! \r\nFind out how she escaped.
