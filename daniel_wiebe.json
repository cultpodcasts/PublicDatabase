I\u0027m still getting used to a lapel microphone. My voice occasionally distorts. You can here my zipper rattling. I bang on the microphone with my hand near the end. And I think a 1/8\u0022 plug that I wasn\u0027t using was banging against the selfie stick. Hopefully it all didn\u0027t make the video unwatchable! \n\n\nSome reading on Thought Reform and Loaded Language:\n\nhttp://changingminds.org/techniques/conversion/lifton_thought_reform.htm\nhttp://www.rationalrevelation.com/tr/loadlang.html\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/use-of-words-loaded-language-and-thought-control-of-believers/\n\n\nMy email: danielwiebe77@yahoo.com",
