      "description": "In 1997, I started studying with the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses. They were so sincere, so studious and so kind. After a year or so, I began going out in field service as an un-baptized publisher.  \n\nMuch to my chagrin, I had mistaken their sincerity for accuracy.  Have you done the same? Are you doing the same?\n\nYou see, the more I learned about the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, the more I discovered that many of their key teaching are     man-made. And to help you and your loved ones conduct your research, I created www.JWTruth.org to help you find the facts in a clear, concise and compelling manner.  \n\nWe will examine many of the prophesies and beliefs of the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses- from their prophesy that the world would end in 1975, to the belief that Jesus would return in 1914 and their belief in the chosen 144,000.\n \nMy intention is to educate and create dialogue in a loving and helpful manner.  For more information on me and our team, please visit http://www.JWTruth.org\n.",
