Enter Straight Incorporated, a controversial new rehab program that promises its tough love approach can set kids back on the straight and narrow. But for the survivors of Straight, their experience tells a horrifyingly different story \u2014 one of abuse, torture, and brainwashing. Season 2 of \u201CThe Sunshine Place\u201D delves into the shocking tale of Straight Incorporated, an experimental teen rehab that descended into a sadistic cult exploiting parents\u0027 deepest fears and their children\u0027s vulnerabilities. This heart-wrenching exploration of parenting, family, and the human spirit intertwines with the dark underbelly of power, money, and politics. And at the heart of it all, we find a connection back to the subject of \u201CThe Sunshine Place\u201D Season 1, Synanon. Executive Produced by Robert Downey Jr., Susan Downey, and Emily Barclay Ford of Team Downey, together with Josh McLaughlin of Wink Pictures. The Sunshine Place is an Audacy original.\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.

It\u0027s the 1970s, and Synanon is a community, a utopia, a cautionary tale, and a cult. But more than anything else, it\u0027s a person, the founder of Synanon, a man named Charles E.

      "description": "Once called \u201Cthe miracle on the beach,\u201D Synanon began in the 1960s as an experimental rehab facility in Santa Monica, California with a radical claim: It could cure heroin addiction. Before long, it would make an even bolder claim: It could cure any of your problems. All you had to do was move in. What started in a house on the beach, soon spread to compounds across the country. The man who made the miracle happen, Charles E. Dederich, aka \u201CChuck,\u201D would be the one to destroy it all, along with the lives of many of his followers and millions of dollars in assets. The Sunshine Place tells the mind-blowing, true-story of Synanon - one of America\u2019s most cutting edge social experiments, turned into one of its most dangerous and violent cults - as it\u2019s never been told before: by the people who lived it. Executive Produced by Robert Downey Jr., Susan Downey, and Emily Barclay Ford for Team Downey and C13Originals, together with Josh McLaughlin for Wink Pictures and written, produced, and directed by Peabody-nominated C13Originals, a Cadence13 Studio.
