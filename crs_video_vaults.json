      "title": "Are Religious Cults Good Or Evil? Ireland 1996",
      "description": "Do religious cults ruin people\u2019s lives or change them for the better?\n\nDissatisfaction with the main Christian churches can provide cults - or new religious movements, with opportunities to attract new recruits.\n\nSome people believe cults are evil and sinister groups who brainwash people and ruin lives. Others who have joined cults say their lives have changed for the better.\n\nPeople shopping in Dublin\u2019s Ilac Centre give their opinions on whether there is any harm to religious cults. Some people interviewed believe cults are very dangerous, associating them with satanic rituals, witchcraft and black magic.\n\nOne woman admits she does not know much about cults but fears,\n\nThey brainwash everybody and take their money.\n\nAnother woman thinks cults are prey on intelligent, successful people who need to fill a void in their lives,\n\nI think people should be very wary.\n\nA man who says he is a Catholic has a relaxed attitude to what people chose to believe,\n\nI think everybody is entitled to whatever religion they would like to adopt.\n\nHowever an elderly woman is entirely dismissive of cults,\n\nCatholics don\u2019t go in for them things you know.\n\n\u2018Gerry Ryan Tonight\u2019 (GRT) is an Irish chat show hosted by Gerry Ryan that aired live for three series on Network 2 between 1995 and 1997.

Speaking to RT\u00C9 News, Collins says:\n\nI\u2019m on top of the world now. It\u2019s great, I\u2019m in a great situation .... My future is bright ahead of me, you know. I\u2019m looking forward to my next fight.\n\nThe Lord Mayor of Cork, Joe O\u2019Callaghan, is now making him an honorary Cork man. But Collins had predicted as far back as 1988 that he would one day be a world champion.\n\nAn RT\u00C9 News report from 11 September 1995.\n\nThe report is introduced by newsreader Bryan Dobson.",

      "description": "There has been a growth in popularity of religious groups like The Children of God and Divine Light Mission (DLM) who are meeting the needs of some young people looking to find meaning in their lives.\n\nDundalk born Tom McGuinness who goes by the biblical name of Zibiah claims to have found new meaning to his life as a member of the religious group \u2018The Children of God\u2019. Tom, along with other members of the group, are spreading the word of \u2018The Children of God\u2019 at St Stephen\u2019s Green in Dublin.\n\nThe Children of God is \n\u0022A religious sect which originated in California in 1968 and which has since spread throughout Europe.\u0022\n\nThe sect appeals mainly to young people who find themselves at odds with society. Each member is a missionary who believes that their work is to spread the word of God and to inform people that God loves them. Their message is The Bible, Jesus and joy largely through song and dance.\n\nAnother religious group seeking new devotees is the Divine Light Mission (DLM) which operates from the Dandelion Market in Dublin. Dubliner Joseph Burn was among the first to join the Divine Light Mission. The group was founded in 1960 by Guru Hans Ji Maharaj in northern India. Their message of inner peace is achieved through meditation.\n\n(Guru Maharaj) has come onto this world to show man how to experience his true identity.\n\nOne member of the DLM first heard about it while living in London and knew she had found what she had been looking for. Another member says that Guru Maharaj has shown him how to experience his soul.\n\nAt a house in Santry, the Mahatma who is second in line to the Guru, teaches lessons in Satsang meditation and preaches the message of DLM. Dublin housewife Mrs O\u2019Reilly is one of the many converts who has been convinced by his message.\n\nI have complete peace of mind. I have an absolute understanding of my own religion. As a Catholic, I can go to mass now and understand what the gospels are about, and for the first time I can fully realise the presence of God.\n\nMrs O\u2019Reilly says that DLM is not a religion but rather something to help you to understand your own religion.\n\nBoth The Children of God and Divine Light Mission forbid both alcohol and tobacco use amongst their followers.\n\nNo need for such drugs, they say, if you receive Jesus into your heart.\n\nThis episode of \u2018Tangents\u2019 was broadcast on 17 October 1972.",
