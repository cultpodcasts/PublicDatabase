She almost did not realize it, because when it happened she was only a teenager. A teenager, however, who becomes a woman and struggles for years to get out of that unhealthy mechanism. In this episode, Amara tells us about her difficult path to the ascent, a happy and fulfilling life away from the community, which, however, she continued to frequent for a long time after leaving the absurd world into which she sold herself. Today, back Sabine, she has received the answers she has been seeking for years in the words of other podcast witnesses and wants to tell how things really turned out for her and, she is now certain, many other sannyasin girls and children.",

So she becomes Amara and she must learn to stay alone to continue living her quest for spirituality, to meet the expectations of the community and to be able to go to the Summer Festival in Oregon, the festival that brings together sannyasins from all over the world since Osho decided to create his ideal city in America, in that piece of land he called Rajneeshpuram. And so, between school and commune, Amara is slowly being introduced to a very simple way of making money, which is to do what so many other girls in the community already do and which until now has only been hinted at in the memories of adult and child sannyasins: selling herself.",

      "description": "Soli, by Roberta LippiOsho earned the definition of \u201Csex guru\u201D because his cult members were allowed to freely express their physical desire, even with multiple partners. The guru had no trouble in openly talking about sex and even gave practical advices to his cult members on how to get the best out of the intercourse. He also preached that children had to know the truth about everything, including sex - but he did not consider that children imitate adults. They want to be like them, do whatever they do. What happens if what they start to imitate is sex? At the center of this episode is Swami Anand Satish, who recalls how all the experiences in the sannyasin communes started far too early. All of them.Cover image by Martino PietropoliMusic by Smokelab",

      "description": "Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, known as Osho, became an Indian spiritual guru in the 1960s. In the mid 70s, the members of his cult founded the Puna Ashram, a commune in India that soon attracted members from all over the world. Mostly, young adults pervaded by the hippie culture, taking their children along. But Osho had very clear ideas about them: \u0022The idea that children belong to you is wrong. Children belong to themselves\u0022. What happened to the hearts and souls of those children, that following the guru\u2019s precepts were left alone to take care of themselves? What have they become today? This is the starting point of a journey through their memories and stories.Cover image by Martino PietropoliMusic by Smokelab",
