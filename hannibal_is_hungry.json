      "description": "Go to https://buyraycon.com/HANNIBALISHUNGRY\n to get 20% off sitewide! Brought to you by Raycon.\n\nIn a shocking tell-all, David E. Taylor\u2019s ex-wife and ex-girlfriend have come forward to expose the alleged inner workings of his ministry and personal life. From accusations of forced labor and abuse to claims of a \u0022harem\u0022 of 100\u002B \u0022wives,\u0022 the details paint a disturbing picture of the self-proclaimed Apostle.\n\nIn this video, we delve into the powerful testimonies of Tabitha Taylor and Vicki Yohe. Tabitha Taylor reveals how she was allegedly subjected to physical and emotional abuse. She describes her ex-husband\u0027s obsession with authority and his harsh treatment of staff. We also examine the federal indictment that alleges David E. Taylor ran a forced labor and money laundering conspiracy, where followers were coerced into working in call centers for free to solicit millions in donations.\n\nGospel singer Vicki Yohe, a former girlfriend of David E. Taylor, shares her story of manipulation and control. She claims he used her for her social media platform to promote his book and that she gave his ministry a lot of money, which she now regrets. Yohe also reveals that after she spoke out, over 100 women contacted her, with many claiming they were also in a relationship with Taylor.\n\nThis is a story of a hidden cult, the misuse of power, and the brave women who chose to speak out to expose the truth.\n\nSources:\n\nWTSP: \u0022Kingdom of God Global Church raid prompts David Taylor\u0027s ex-partner to speak out\u0022\n\nThe News-Herald: \u0022Pastor accused of running his multimillion-dollar Taylor church as a \u0027cult\u0027\u0022\n\nRiverfront Times: \u0022More on the Alleged Cult That Bought Nelly\u0027s Crumbling Mansion\u0022\n\nDepartment of Justice: \u0022Two Self-Professed Religious Leaders Who Used Physical and Psychological Abuse to Coerce Victims to Solicit Tens of Millions in Donations Federally Charged and Arrested\u0022\n\nFOX 13 Tampa Bay: \u0022Former church worker relieved after federal raids, arrests of church leaders: \u0027I can\u0027t get back that time\u0027\u0022\n\nCBS News Detroit: \u00222 Michigan ministry leaders accused of running forced labor organization, money laundering scheme\u0022\n\nKPRC2 News: \u0022\u0027This sounds like a cult\u0027: Woman describes friend\u0027s experience in church at center of FBI raid\u0022\n\nWL News: \u0022David E.
