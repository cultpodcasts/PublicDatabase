      "description": "A group of alleged squatters identified by viewers of a recent Atlanta News First investigation as members of a polygamist group have been evicted from the DeKalb County house in which they were residing. Viewers claimed at least two of the squatters are associated with a polygamist group known as Carbon Nation , which DeKalb County prosecutors refer to as a sex cult. Its leader, Eligio Bishop , went on trial in February 2024 for false imprisonment, rape and posting a revenge porn video online. After a jury found Bishop guilty, he was sentenced to life in prison. After the sentencing, a group of squatters began occupying a Tucker, Georgia, home. The house is a rental property owned and managed by Sylvan Homes. Sources told Atlanta News First Investigates the squatters changed the locks and used a fraudulent lease to turn on water service.
