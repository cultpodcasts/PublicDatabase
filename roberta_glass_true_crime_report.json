Saraga started taking NXIVM\u0027s Executive Sucess Program in Mexico in 2013 but left in 2015 because no one in the program was acheiving the results promised. When she heard about how and why Mark Vincente left NXIVM, Saraga became a tireless researcher of the cult. Her research was utilized by the FBI and Eastern District of New York\u0027s District Attorney\u0027s offiice in convicting Keith Raniere.
