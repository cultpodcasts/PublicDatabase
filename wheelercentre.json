      "description": "Scientology\u2019s founder, L. Ron Hubbard, once defined the religion as being in service of \u2018a civilisation without insanity, without criminals and without war, where the able can prosper and honest beings can have rights, and where man is free to rise to greater heights\u2019.\n\nAlmost 60 years since its foundation, though, Scientology has become a uniquely contentious phenomenon \u2013 with many questioning its status as a religion, cult or business, and with a reputation for fiercely defensive, litigious and coercive reactions to criticism. One of the first to feel the Church\u2019s wrath was Paulette Cooper \u2013 whose 1971 book, The Scandal of Scientology, saw her become the target of an elaborate plot which set out to destroy her credibility, frame her and land her with a 15 year prison sentence. Codenamed \u2018Miss Lovely\u2019 by Church operatives, Cooper is now the subject of investigative journalist Tony Ortega\u2019s book, The Unbreakable Miss Lovely.\n\nOrtega is a long-time chronicler of Scientology, and one of its leading scrutineers. Featured in Alex Gibney\u2019s HBO documentary Going Clear, he\u2019s the executive editor of TheLipTV and former editor-in-chief of The Village Voice. He visits Melbourne \u2013 where the world\u2019s first inquiry into Scientology was held in 1963, and Scientology was first banned in 1965 \u2013 for a chat with Steve Cannane, who\u2019s currently writing a book on Scientology\u2019s history in Australia.\n\n\u2014\n\nSupport the Wheeler Centre\nIn an uncertain time for everybody, we\u0027re working hard to bring you conversations and ideas through podcasts, live-streams and publishing \u2013 all freely accessible.
