      "description": "Content Warning: This episode discusses murder, suicide, and other sensitive or controversial topics. Ooof. This one is a full-blown inferno, and it is STILL DEVELOPING. Meet the Zizians\u2014who refer to themselves as\u2014wait for it\u2014the Vegan Siths. *Cue \u0022The Imperial March\u0022* This case unravels the shocking layers of a radical faction of rationalists who, despite preaching altruism, have left a trail of brutality in their wake. With at least four brutal murders and two additional deaths linked to the group, their ideology has mutated from intellectual posturing into a twisted labyrinth of suicide, faked deaths, crime, deception, and murder. This culty group, led by the enigmatic Jack Amadeus \u201CZiz\u201D LaSota, the Zizians believe they are the masterminds of a better world\u2014until their so-called rationalism turned into something totally irrational, super warped, and very, very dangerous. Murders, fugitives, and a tangled mess of legal chaos later, the question remains: Were these people already broken before they found rationalism, or did rationalism break them? And with some members still at large, is the story really over? Buckle up\u2014because this isn\u2019t just another cult story. This is a real-time unraveling of a belief system gone deadly.

      "description": "In part two of this two-part case, we are back to the manipulation, crime, and charisma of Daniel Perez, AKA Lou Castro. In part one, we explored Perez\u2019s control over his followers led to a series of suspicious deaths, each conveniently linked to large life insurance payouts that supported the cult\u0027s luxurious lifestyle. For part two, we begin to really dig into how Perez\u0027s control extended beyond financial exploitation. In the spring of 2011, the \u0027nail in the coffin\u0027 for bringing down Daniel Perez was a recovered hard drive full of incriminating information. We begin to get into the testimonies of three former cult members that would be the catalyst to Perez\u0027s arrest and witness testimonies of unimaginable horror that was going on at behind the \u0027kumbaya\u0027 facade of Angel\u0027s Landing. We will explore how Daniel Perez convinced his followers that he was a centuries-old supernatural being or angel with special powers, and how he needed to have sex with young girls to stay alive and maintain his power. Hang out with us as we tie up this intense two-part episode about this \u0027supernatural\u0027 cult leader (who was just a gross old dude, tbh) that left a trail of devastation from his manipulation and deceit.

      "description": "In part one of this two-part case, Bailey takes us through the investigation into the Angel\u2019s Landing cult. It is a chilling tale of manipulation, crime, and a charismatic leader who preyed on the vulnerable. At the heart of the case is Daniel Perez, also known as Lou Castro, who presented himself as a clairvoyant and prophet. Claiming to have supernatural powers and the ability to foresee the future, Perez lured followers to a secluded compound in Kansas, promising them protection and prosperity. However, behind the fa\u00E7ade of spiritual guidance lay a sinister operation. The group was financially supported by the life insurance policies of its members, many of whom met untimely and suspicious deaths. Authorities became suspicious after the death of Patricia (Gomez) Hughes in 2003, officially ruled an accident. The trail led investigators to uncover a web of deceit, coercion, and exploitation spanning years. The Angel\u2019s Landing Cult remains a harrowing reminder of the dangers of an absolute predator manipulating a group of followers with blind devotion. Thanks for listening!

      "description": "As this case evolves, it seems as if we are reading a work of fiction. Perjury, coercion, disregarded alibis, plea bargains, and life sentences without parole all play a role in these twisted, sensationalized murder trials. After 40 years, some of the police officials originally involved in the case aren\u2019t quite convinced of the final verdicts. Open your mind, get out the push pins and red yarn, and see if you can piece together what truly happened between October 1979 and February 1980. Is Carl Drew the self-proclaimed \u201CSon of Satan\u201D local pimp turned murderer that many believe him to be, or was he falsely convicted? Is this the East Coast\u2019s version of the West Memphis Three? Or are we looking at hardcore psychopathic killers who are guilty beyond reasonable doubt? Was this a legitimate Devil-worshipping sex cult or was it a dark but effective tool to manipulate and gain control? Try to keep a rational mind throughout this convoluted, complex, and twisted case.

      "description": "The Satanic Ritual Abuse Scare, or Satanic Panic, began in the 1980\u2019s in North America and lasted throughout much of the 1990\u2019s. This widespread hysteria swept across the country alleging threats of child sexual abuse, human ritual sacrifice, teenage abductions, animal sacrifice, claims of Satanic Cults, and even went as far as claiming that heavy metal rock, horrorcore music and fantasy games were the work of the devil. This panic was contributed to thousands of unsubstantiated cases and accusations of Satanic Ritual Abuse throughout the United States. The impact for some was much more significant than for others. Fall River Massachusetts, a historic mill city better known for the notorious case of Lizzie Borden, was arguably not immune from this hysteria and allegations. Fall River was home to what would be dubbed as \u2018The Fall River Cult Murders\u2019 which centers around the brutal slayings of three females: Doreen Levesque, Barbara Raposa and Karen Marsden. It\u0027s a classic \u0027whodunnit\u0027 case at the center of a messy web between Robin Murphy, Andy Maltais and Carl Drew aka \u0027The Son of Satan\u0027. This episode covers everything from murder, the soft white underbelly of the Fall River sex work industry, alleged Devil worshipping, to a \u0027Satanic Cult\u0027. Hang out with us while we dive down this dark rabbit hole and land in the realm of the occult for the first half of this wild case. Thanks for listening!

      "description": "In a digital age it would make sense to have a digital cult. Rashad Jamal White uses multiple social media platforms to promote his school, The University of Cosmic Intelligence and enlighten his followers who he refers to as \u201Cgods and goddesses\u201D. Rashad Jamal claims to have a deep understanding in subjects from metaphysics to marine biology to world history. He is happy to share his thoughts, passions, and opinions\u2026for a price. Hundreds of thousands are tuning in, liking, subscribing, and paying for this knowledge that he frequently uploads from the Barrow County Detainment Center. That\u2019s right, this convicted sex offender is still largely influencing his followers and recently 6 of those confirmed followers have gone missing (including two children).\u00A0 That is in addition to 2 followers who have been linked to brutal homicides. Let\u2019s dive into the bizarre world of Rashad Jamal and his \u2018culty\u2019 University of Cosmic Intelligence and discuss the character parallels between this alleged cult leader and others. More importantly, let\u2019s spread the word and bring these 6 missing people back home. Make sure to tune in on Friday 2/2/2024 to listen to our interview with cult expert Rick Alan Ross.
