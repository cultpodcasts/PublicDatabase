      "description": "The Worst Family Cults Who Made Their Own Kids S*X SLAVES\n\nThis guy is a liar and a fraud and he took s*xual advantage of children. \nHe said it was his duty to have 21 children by virgins.)\n\nImagine being a child and realizing your whole life is a lie. For the Turpin siblings, \u0022normal\u0022 meant being chained to beds and starved until they could barely stand. For the Colt children, it meant running into the woods to escape relatives who saw them as prey. For David Koresh\u0027s victims, it meant being told at age 11 that \u0022God\u0022 had chosen them as his child brides. \n\nSadly, these aren\u0027t horror film scripts \u2013 they happened right here, right now, to people just like you and me. Their stories deserve to be told, their voices deserve to be heard, and their courage reminds us to stay vigilant in a world where evil often hides behind closed doors.\n\n#truecrime #documentary #annahorrorstories",
