      "description": "Sponsored by Serenity Salt Spa In this episode of Conversations with Rich Bennett, I sit down with Tammy Cox, a Transformational Coach who helps women heal unresolved childhood trauma to rebuild their relationships and rediscover their true selves. Tammy shares her personal journey, growing up in a deeply religious and restrictive environment, and how breaking free from past pain led her to embrace healing through spirituality, metaphysics, and science. We dive into the impact of childhood trauma on relationships, why self-healing is essential for emotional intimacy, and how understanding the beliefs we form in our early years can unlock personal transformation. Tammy also reveals the unique approach she takes in her coaching, including inner child work and subconscious healing techniques, to help women break toxic relationship cycles and cultivate lasting love. Whether you\u0027re navigating a relationship challenge, struggling with past wounds, or seeking a new path to self-discovery, this episode is packed with insights that will leave you inspired.
