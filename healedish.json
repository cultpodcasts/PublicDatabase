      "description": "In this episode, I sit down with Cassandra, a survivor whose story shines a heartbreaking light on the intersections of spiritual abuse, grooming, and prophetic manipulation. At just 14 years old, Cassandra was groomed and sexually abused by her youth pastor. He was 28. Instead of protection or justice, she was blamed by those who should have protected her. Years later, she was targeted again- this time by a worship leader at EHOP, a cult-like spinoff of IHOP. He stalked her on MySpace before drawing her into a cohesive dynamic built on power and control. After abusing at least 15 women in the church, the organization finally shut down\u2026but not before the victims were forced to take the blame publicly. It wasn\u2019t until she began learning about trauma, nervous system healing, and how to name abuse that she was finally able to break free. She began untangling truth from manipulation, and she\u2019s been healing. This episode is for anyone who\u2019s ever questioned their intuition because of leadership. For anyone who\u2019s questioned their reality, their worth, or whether they were somehow to blame. You\u2019re not alone. \u2014 Cassandra\u2019s TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@cassandralau.co Cassandra\u2019s Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/cassandralau.co/ Cassandra\u2019s Website: https://cassandralau.co/ Jubilee\u2019s TikTok: \u2060https://www.tiktok.com/@jubileedawns\u2060 Jubilee\u2019s IG: \u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060 https://www.instagram.com/jubileedawns\u2060 Healed-ish TikTok: \u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060https://www.tiktok.com/@healedishpodcast\u2060 Healed-ish IG: \u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060 https://www.instagram.com/healedishpodcast\u2060 Apply To Share Your Story: https://forms.gle/S3wYnxTUBRHVE6bH7",

Jedidiah grew up watching his father gain global acclaim for prophetic insights , but behind the stage lights was a man faking words, using conference registration lists to look people up, and abusing his power to manipulate, control, and harm. Jedidiah opens up about the painful tension of loving someone who has caused harm, someone he still hoped would turn things around, while also feeling a deep responsibility to protect others by telling the truth. This is a powerful look at what happens when charisma is platformed over character, and why Jedidiah is now speaking out against spiritual manipulation within the NAR. We also talk about how his story helped me process my own (including a false prophecy I received from his father). \u2014 Follow for more: Jedidiah\u2019s IG: https://www.instagram.com/jedidiahhartley/ Jubilee\u2019s TikTok: \u2060 @jubileedawns\u2060 Jubilee\u2019s IG: \u2060 @jubileedawns\u2060 Healed-ish TikTok: \u2060 @healedishpodcast\u2060 Healed-ish IG: \u2060 @healedishpodcast\u2060 Apply To Share Your Story: \u2060 Submit Here\u2060",
