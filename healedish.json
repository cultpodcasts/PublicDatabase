      "description": "In this episode, I\u2019m joined by Beth Granger, author of Born and Razed, who shares her story of being taken from her parents at just four years old and placed into what was presented as a Christian boarding school, but functioned as a deeply controlling and abusive cult. Beth describes being put on a diet at the age of five, subjected to \u201Clight sessions\u201D designed to psychologically tear children down, and raised under constant fear and obedience enforced by 2 women known as \u201Cthe sisters.\u201D Beth spent more than 30 years inside this system before eventually escaping and beginning the long process of healing. Her story became part of the first historic cult abuse case in Canada to win. In this conversation, Beth reflects on survival, identity after control, and what it means to reclaim your voice after a lifetime of spiritual abuse. - Beth Granger\u2019s IG: https://www.instagram.com/happygranger/ Beth Granger\u2019s Book \u0026 Website: https://bethgranger.ca - Patreon: \u2060https://www.patreon.com/Healedish\u2060 Follow for more: Jubilee\u2019s TikTok: \u2060https://www.tiktok.com/@jubileedawns\u2060 Jubilee\u2019s IG: \u2060\u2060\u2060 \u2060https://www.instagram.com/jubileedawns\u2060 Healed-ish TikTok: \u2060\u2060\u2060 \u2060https://www.tiktok.com/@healedishpodcast\u2060 Healed-ish IG: \u2060\u2060\u2060 \u2060https://www.instagram.com/healedishpodcast\u2060 Apply To Share Your Story: \u2060\u2060 \u2060https://forms.gle/23f8SPBX1VntsqUU8\u2060",

      "description": "Becca was raised in the Mormon church, where nearly every part of her childhood revolved around faith, obedience, and preparation for marriage. From constant church commitments and Mormon Treks to attending BYU, her life followed a path that was considered righteous and ideal, but rarely questioned. In this episode, Becca opens up about Mormon doctrine, purity culture, and the invasive ways control over women\u2019s bodies can show up in religious spaces. She shares her experience of a premarital medical exam, being given dilators, and undergoing an unnecessary hymenectomy. Now divorced, deconstructed, and living fear free as a queer woman, Becca reflects on unlearning shame, reclaiming autonomy, and rebuilding her identity outside the church. - Becca\u0027s Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@ripbeccs - Patreon: \u2060https://www.patreon.com/Healedish\u2060 Follow for more: Jubilee\u2019s TikTok: \u2060https://www.tiktok.com/@jubileedawns\u2060 Jubilee\u2019s IG: \u2060\u2060\u2060 \u2060https://www.instagram.com/jubileedawns\u2060 Healed-ish TikTok: \u2060\u2060\u2060 \u2060https://www.tiktok.com/@healedishpodcast\u2060 Healed-ish IG: \u2060\u2060\u2060 \u2060https://www.instagram.com/healedishpodcast\u2060 Apply To Share Your Story: \u2060\u2060 \u2060https://forms.gle/23f8SPBX1VntsqUU8\u2060",

Amy shares her experience growing up adjacent to fame on 19 Kids \u0026 Counting, the red flags she noticed early on, and what it was like holding truth while surrounded by silence. We also talk about her book, Holy Disrupter, and why she believes disruption can be sacred when it comes to breaking unhealthy family systems. Amy opens up about healing from an abusive father, how her relationship with God has evolved, and how she is learning to live with honesty, boundaries, and purpose.

      "description": "In this episode of Healed-ish, Cherie talks about growing up in an ultra-strict Christian home where she was homeschooled with curriculum that rewrote history, promoted strict creationism, and even framed Barack Obama as the anti-Christ. From childhood, Cherie was taught that her primary purpose was to become a wife and mother within the ideals of complementarianism. At her Christian college, men and women were not allowed to spend time together off campus, and girls were even prohibited from wearing their hair wet because it was considered tempting. Cherie shares what sparked her deconstruction, being in an interfaith marriage, and why she is now raising awareness about Project 2025, something she recognizes deeply because she was essentially raised inside its ideology. This conversation is about indoctrination, awakening, and speaking out before history repeats itself. - Cherie\u2019s Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@canceledchristian - Patreon: \u2060https://www.patreon.com/Healedish\u2060 Follow for more: Jubilee\u2019s TikTok: \u2060https://www.tiktok.com/@jubileedawns\u2060 Jubilee\u2019s IG: \u2060\u2060\u2060 \u2060https://www.instagram.com/jubileedawns\u2060 Healed-ish TikTok: \u2060\u2060\u2060 \u2060https://www.tiktok.com/@healedishpodcast\u2060 Healed-ish IG: \u2060\u2060\u2060 \u2060https://www.instagram.com/healedishpodcast\u2060 Apply To Share Your Story: \u2060\u2060 \u2060https://forms.gle/23f8SPBX1VntsqUU8\u2060",

In this episode, we talk about his upbringing, what led him to embrace purity culture as a teenager, writing his book at just 21 years old, and watching it explode across evangelical spaces in ways he never imagined. Josh opens up about what later caused him to question everything he once believed, how listening to the stories of people harmed by purity culture changed him, and why he ultimately chose to publicly renounce his own book and apologize for the damage it caused. Together, we explore accountability, deconstruction, and what it really looks like to rebuild your life when your faith, identity, and certainty fall apart. - Josh\u2019s IG: https://www.instagram.com/harrisjosh/ Josh Harris\u2019s Website: https://joshharris.com Surviving I Kissed Dating Goodbye Documentary: https://streamable.com/1ldz9c?utm_source=ig\u0026utm_medium=social\u0026utm_content=link_in_bio\u0026fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQMMjU2MjgxMDQwNTU4AAGnwVL6rB615JLPYmBioQFG75ATVnZuQ1OS8VWvve_EKhvfII63IhpIEnveJQM_aem_vmFb_Hm5AvMLmCul_tdSjA - Patreon: \u2060https://www.patreon.com/Healedish\u2060 Follow for more: Jubilee\u2019s TikTok: \u2060https://www.tiktok.com/@jubileedawns\u2060 Jubilee\u2019s IG: \u2060\u2060\u2060 \u2060https://www.instagram.com/jubileedawns\u2060 Healed-ish TikTok: \u2060\u2060\u2060 \u2060https://www.tiktok.com/@healedishpodcast\u2060 Healed-ish IG: \u2060\u2060\u2060 \u2060https://www.instagram.com/healedishpodcast\u2060 Apply To Share Your Story: \u2060\u2060 \u2060https://forms.gle/23f8SPBX1VntsqUU8\u2060",

      "description": "Krystina grew up Southern Baptist, in a world where women stayed silent on stage and drums were considered sinful. Later, in a charismatic church, she received unsettling prophetic words that painted her future as \u201Canointed, but lonely.\u201D She pursued worship ministry at Liberty University, only to face racism, tokenization, and microaggressions from the very people who claimed to love her. Behind the scenes, she discovered how worship was intentionally designed to manipulate emotions.... something she once believed was purely spiritual. Everything shifted when she became a mother. Wanting to raise her child with honesty and clarity, Krystina began revisiting her faith with fresh eyes. Instead of the certainty she hoped for, she found herself wrestling with questions she had never allowed herself to ask. Over time, this led her into a season of deep reevaluation and eventually toward a new journey outside of Christianity. Today, she and her husband share their story on Life Beyond Belief, offering a space for people navigating doubt, change, and rebuilding after leaving a faith tradition. In this episode, Krystina opens up about the moments that shaped her, the questions that transformed her, and what it looks like to find peace on the other side of certainty. - Krystina\u2019s Tiktok: \u2060https://www.tiktok.com/@lifebeyondbelief\u2060 Krystina\u2019s IG: \u2060https://www.instagram.com/krysandken/\u2060 Life Beyond Belief Podcast: https://open.spotify.com/show/5jSEc2KnDIifE3ATcMf0br?si=0953232c76c64ccb - Patreon: \u2060\u2060https://www.patreon.com/Healedish\u2060\u2060 Follow for more: Jubilee\u2019s TikTok: \u2060\u2060https://www.tiktok.com/@jubileedawns\u2060\u2060 Jubilee\u2019s IG: \u2060\u2060\u2060 \u2060\u2060https://www.instagram.com/jubileedawns\u2060\u2060 Healed-ish TikTok: \u2060\u2060\u2060 \u2060\u2060https://www.tiktok.com/@healedishpodcast\u2060\u2060 Healed-ish IG: \u2060\u2060\u2060 \u2060\u2060https://www.instagram.com/healedishpodcast\u2060\u2060 Apply To Share Your Story: \u2060\u2060 \u2060\u2060https://forms.gle/23f8SPBX1VntsqUU8\u2060\u2060",

      "description": "Part 1 of 1\nColten grew up in the Holiness movement, a Pentecostal tradition with even stricter rules than most. In his church, women were not allowed to cut their hair, wear jewelry, or even wear pants. Baptism had to be done in a very specific way, or else your eternity was on the line. His dad was the pastor, and Colten took those rules to heart, believing his salvation depended on them.\nIn this episode, Colten shares vivid memories of his upbringing, including the moment he broke down sobbing after seeing his mom wear pants for the first time because he believed she was going to hell. He talks about what it was like to go to seminary, to begin evaluating what he had been taught, and how he has turned those experiences into knowledge he now shares with thousands of people on TikTok.\n-\nColten\u2019s IG: https://www.instagram.com/coltenbarnaby/\nColten\u2019s Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@coltenbarnaby\n-\nPatreon: \u2060https://www.patreon.com/Healedish\u2060\nFollow for more:\u00A0\u00A0\nJubilee\u2019s TikTok: \u2060https://www.tiktok.com/@jubileedawns\u2060\n\u00A0Jubilee\u2019s IG: \u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060https://www.instagram.com/jubileedawns\u2060\n\u00A0Healed-ish TikTok: \u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060https://www.tiktok.com/@healedishpodcast\u2060\n\u00A0Healed-ish IG: \u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060https://www.instagram.com/healedishpodcast\u2060\n\u00A0Apply To Share Your Story: \u2060\u2060\u2060https://forms.gle/23f8SPBX1VntsqUU8\u2060",

But her story doesn\u2019t begin or end there.\nIn this conversation, Gabrielle opens up about the layers of loss and heartbreak that shaped her. She shares about losing her father at a young age, grieving the death of a boyfriend, and living with the belief that everyone she loved would eventually die. We talk about the pain that inspired her to write, the healing she\u2019s done since, and the vibrant life and community she has built today.\nThis episode is about love, grief, resilience, and rewriting your story even when the plot twists are unthinkable.\n-\nGabrielle\u2019s IG: https://www.instagram.com/gabriellestone/\nGabrielle\u2019s Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@gabrielle_stone\n-\nPatreon: \u2060https://www.patreon.com/Healedish\u2060\nFollow for more:\u00A0\u00A0\nJubilee\u2019s TikTok: \u2060https://www.tiktok.com/@jubileedawns\u2060\n\u00A0Jubilee\u2019s IG: \u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060https://www.instagram.com/jubileedawns\u2060\n\u00A0Healed-ish TikTok: \u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060https://www.tiktok.com/@healedishpodcast\u2060\n\u00A0Healed-ish IG: \u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060https://www.instagram.com/healedishpodcast\u2060\n\u00A0Apply To Share Your Story: \u2060\u2060\u2060https://forms.gle/23f8SPBX1VntsqUU8\u2060",

We first met as teenagers in youth group, navigating the pressures of purity pledges, religious guilt, and the rollercoaster of charismatic Christianity. While we shared plenty of fun moments during those years, we were also shaped by environments that demanded conformity and obedience.\nKenzie went on to join the International House of Prayer (IHOP), a high-control religious group where the spiritual abuse ran deep. While newly pregnant, she was forced to stay awake in prayer through the night, and when she expressed doubts, men laid hands on her belly and prayed her child would become a martyr. That moment marked one of many in which her humanity and dignity were disregarded in the name of faith.\nHer story didn\u2019t end there. Kenzie eventually left IHOP, got divorced, and began the long process of deconstruction. Today, she identifies as queer, continues to navigate hard conversations with friends and family, and is writing a new chapter in her healing journey. She and I now co-host The Overshare Hour, where our shared history adds both depth and laughter to every conversation.

      "description": "Part 1 of 1\nYou might know Jake Deyton from TikTok, where he shares Taylor Swift chart updates and debunks excessive Easter eggs. But behind the music commentary is a powerful story of survival, deconstruction, and acceptance.\nJake grew up in a rural Appalachian town in North Carolina, where church attendance was essential if you wanted friends or acceptance. At just three years old, he was told he needed to repent or burn in hell forever. When he learned what being gay meant, his immediate thought was \u201Cuh oh,\u201D because he knew deep down that was him. Fearing rejection from the church and his community, he buried that truth for years and even promised himself he would never come out.\nToday, Jake is married to his husband, raising two children, and living free from the beliefs that once held him captive. In this conversation, he shares how he went from hiding in fear to becoming exactly who he was taught to fear.\n-\nJake\u2019s TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@jakedeyton1\nThe Lost Lore Podcast: https://linktr.ee/thelostlorepod\nThe Lost Lore Podcast Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thelostlorepod\n-\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Healedish\n-\nFollow Jubilee on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@jubileedawns\nFollow Jubilee on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/jubileedawns\nFollow Healed-ish on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@healedishpodcast\nFollow Healed-ish on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/healedishpodcast\nApply To Share Your Story: https://forms.gle/23f8SPBX1VntsqUU8",

      "description": "Part 1 of 1 You might recognize Samantha as a licensed therapist who now helps others heal from the very belief systems that once shaped her. But before she began that work, Sam and I actually sat in the same small group at Bethel. In this episode, Sam shares her story of being introduced to JH Ranch at just 14 years old. She attended a father-daughter retreat where she was asked to sign a contract pledging to remain pure until marriage. That contract became a cornerstone of her identity, and she returned to JH Ranch as a volunteer for many summers. Her journey eventually led her to the Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry, where she attended all three years. During her third year, she began to question the teachings and became increasingly disillusioned with the environment. That season marked the beginning of a deeper unraveling and healing process. Today, Sam is a somatic therapist who specializes in working with individuals recovering from religious trauma. She shares how she reconnected with her body, learned to trust herself again, and how she now helps others do the same. This conversation touches on identity, purity culture, embodiment, and what it means to reclaim your story after spiritual disillusionment. \u2014 Samantha\u2019s website: https://www.samantharedondotherapy.com/ Spiritual Harm Process Group: Info: https://www.samantharedondotherapy.com/offerings Sign up: https://forms.gle/qKznXsRGtiVft27R7 Samantha\u2019s IG: https://www.instagram.com/wild.reciprocity Samantha\u2019s Substack: wildreciprocity.substack.com Patreon: \u2060https://www.patreon.com/Healedish\u2060 Follow for more: Jubilee\u2019s TikTok: \u2060https://www.tiktok.com/@jubileedawns\u2060 Jubilee\u2019s IG: \u2060\u2060\u2060 \u2060https://www.instagram.com/jubileedawns\u2060 Healed-ish TikTok: \u2060\u2060\u2060 \u2060https://www.tiktok.com/@healedishpodcast\u2060 Healed-ish IG: \u2060\u2060\u2060 \u2060https://www.instagram.com/healedishpodcast\u2060 Apply To Share Your Story: \u2060\u2060 \u2060https://forms.gle/23f8SPBX1VntsqUU8\u2060",

At just 14 years old, Cassandra was groomed and sexually abused by her youth pastor. He was 28. Instead of protection or justice, she was blamed by those who should have protected her. Years later, she was targeted again- this time by a worship leader at EHOP, a cult-like spinoff of IHOP. He stalked her on MySpace before drawing her into a cohesive dynamic built on power and control. After abusing at least 15 women in the church, the organization finally shut down\u2026but not before the victims were forced to take the blame publicly. It wasn\u2019t until she began learning about trauma, nervous system healing, and how to name abuse that she was finally able to break free. She began untangling truth from manipulation, and she\u2019s been healing. This episode is for anyone who\u2019s ever questioned their intuition because of leadership. For anyone who\u2019s questioned their reality, their worth, or whether they were somehow to blame.

After months of planning, dreaming, and preparing to walk down the aisle, her fianc\u00E9 vanished. He didn\u2019t show up to the ceremony, and he never came back. No goodbye. No explanation. Just\u2026 gone.\nWe talk about what it\u2019s like to experience that kind of betrayal on what was supposed to be the happiest day of her life. She shares what it was like to face it not just privately, but in front of an entire room full of people who came to celebrate her. And how, despite the heartbreak, she and her people decided to reclaim the day with joy, dancing, and celebration.\nShe shares how telling her story online has not only helped her process the pain, but connected her with thousands of new friends who supported her healing. From going viral on TikTok to redefining what healing looks like, she brings humor, heartbreak, and power to every part of this conversation.\nThis episode is for anyone who\u2019s ever felt discarded, ghosted, or unsure if they\u2019d ever feel whole again.

At just 12 years old, a trusted adult began building a relationship with her that would eventually become romantic when she was 19.\nFor years, Mary Beth believed the connection she had with him was special, even meaningful. We talk about what it\u2019s like to untangle memories that once felt positive, the emotional confusion that often comes with grooming, and the deep work required to reclaim your story. Mary Beth brings so much wisdom, tenderness, and clarity to a topic that many people have a hard time naming.\nShe is now releasing her first book, Thinking of You, which explores her story in depth and offers insight into how these experiences often begin quietly and subtly. It\u2019s a book for anyone who has ever questioned their own story, or felt alone in their process of understanding the past.\n-\nMary Beth\u0027s Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@mary.beth.runnoe?lang=en\nMary Beth\u0027s IG: https://www.instagram.com/mary.beth.runnoe/\n\nResources on Grooming: https://rainn.org/news/grooming-know-warning-signs\n-\nJubilee\u2019s TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@jubileedawns\nJubilee\u2019s IG: \u2060\u2060\u2060https://www.instagram.com/jubileedawns\nHealed-ish TikTok: \u2060\u2060\u2060https://www.tiktok.com/@healedishpodcast\nHealed-ish IG: \u2060\u2060\u2060https://www.instagram.com/healedishpodcast\nApply To Share Your Story: \u2060\u2060https://forms.gle/23f8SPBX1VntsqUU8",
