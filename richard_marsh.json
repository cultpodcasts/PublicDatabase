      "title": "Pete Perisin and Shelby Elias v. residents of Barrington IL. A PBCC public relations disaster!",
      "description": "Barrington. A $3 million quid pro quo?\nThe President and Vice-president of the South Barrington Park District Board of Commissioners are Pete Perisin and Shelby Elias. These two have been instrumental in pushing through the Plymouth Brethren \u201Cchurch\u201D school and superstore deal, by fair means and foul, despite the glaring evidence that this would be detrimental to the community and to the Park District\u2019s tax base.\nThe million dollar question is\u2026why?\nI can tell you exactly why. Pete Perisin and Shelby Elias are both realtors.\nhttps://www.coldwellbankerhomes.com/.../peter.../aid_89123/\nhttps://www.compass.com/agents/2306278/\nTo understand the significance of this, I have to explain some of the extraordinary rules that the PBCC imposes on its members. The PBCC place great importance on living in close proximity to their Gospel Hall or \u201CChurch\u201D \u2013 ideally within walking distance, but at the very most, within 10 miles.\nThe present Gospel Hall for the Chicago PBCC congregation is in Melrose Park, due south of O\u2019Hare International Airport. The proposed new Gospel Hall is 27 miles away by road. The 10 mile radius catchment areas for the old and new hall have no overlap \u2013 so when the new hall is built, and the old hall closed - every single PBCC household will be moving to the Barrington area \u2013 and there are more than 60 households. With the need to both sell their old houses, and to buy new ones, that is 130 or more real estate transactions over the period of a year or two.\nThe brethren in any congregation will typically all be loyal customers of one or two realtors. That is because they have very specific housing requirements relating to their religious rules, and there is usually an informal \u201Cgroup buying\u201D arrangement where the realtor will tip off the PBCC about suitable properties for homes or halls in exchange for the loyalty of the community. It would be extremely simple for PBCC elders Steve Johnstone and Dale Diener to ensure that Pete Perisin and Shelby Elias got the lion\u2019s share of the brethren members\u0027 real estate business, in exchange for facilitating the purchase and rezoning of \u201CArea N\u201D at a remarkably cheap price.\nWhat would a deal like this be worth to our \u201Cvolunteer\u201D Commissioners, Perisin and Elias?\nBrethren do not live in cheap homes. They do not live in townhouses, or apartments. They like to be as far from their neighbors as possible, and nothing suits them better than a McMansion on at least an acre of ground. Their average home value is going to be at least $800,000.\nSo assuming 130 real estate transactions \u2013 65 sales and 65 purchases, that is a total of $104 million. Taking a conservative realtor\u2019s commission rate of 3% , our friends the President and Vice-President could benefit to the tune of $3,120,000.\nThe whole scheme is a realtor\u0027s wet dream. What other possible use for the land could bring 130 high value transactions in to their bank accounts?\nI would suggest that the lawyer for the \u201Cvarious residents of Barrington\u201D brushes up on \u201CConflict of Interest\u201D law.",

      "description": "This piece largely concerns an Evangelical sect known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church it is a  particularly insular organization, it\u0027s not very big, maybe 50 000 members worldwide and it it rests on the theology that the rest of the world is wicked, only members of this church are good and pure and therefore they shouldn\u0027t associate with anybody outside the church, even other Evangelical denominations much less other religions or non-believers and that begets I think what has been alleged is cult-like behavior. They become increasingly insular, anybody who tries to leave gets excommunicated, denounced and what we\u0027ve seen in Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere is this practice of hiring private investigators to go after people who have left the church and those who have spoken out about it, and seemingly that\u0027s what happened here in Canada, allegedly that\u0027s what happened here.  This Wallace fellow was was hired by this semi-prominent lawyer I think working independently, a guy by the name of Gerald Chipeur (supposedly Pierre Poilievre\u0027s dad) and Chipeur hires him to go track down this one particular whistleblower who had left the church and and kind of rung the bell about some of these shady practices. Well over the course of of doing that contract Wallace has a falling out with Chipeur and with the church and some others and he actually goes to the guy he was supposed to be surveilling and said \u0022Hey listen, the church that has it out to get you, they want me to track you down, they want me to take your cell phone, they might even want me to kidnap you. I think you should be aware and maybe you want to skip town.\u0022 So this is all well supported by these documents and this is all some pretty crazy stuff. I mean you know this is kind of Scientology-like behavior, this is the sort of thing we should be aware of and alert to and worried about. This sort of behavior we should not be tolerating from from a religious sect in this country and it\u0027s worth  a fair bit of scrutiny.",

ALL THE DIRECTORS OF #GRANTAPROCESSORS ARE PBCC MEMBERS, AND CURRENT OR FORMER TRUSTEES OF #PBCC CHARITABLE TRUSTS. The attack occurred when I was publishing posts exposing multi million dollar fraud and corruption in another PBCC owned business, the directors of which are close friends of the Granta Directors. I cannot name the second business for legal reasons.\nThis hack gave the PBCC full access to all my FB messenger messages including months of personal correspondence with my fianc\u00E9e. \nThis attack is utterly illegal, immoral and repugnant.\nThe attack was in September 2017. I have been under constant legal, and illegal harassment from the UBT and PBCC for 5 years now.",
