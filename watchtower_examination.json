      "description": "I am lost for words to TRULY describe what is going on here. Of course, dubious people have been using the mind-controlling or propaganda device, PROJECTION, where the messenger seeks to shift focus from their evil by claiming others are guilty of it. \n\nIt makes them look all the more innocent in the eyes of their captives, because they seem to totally opposed to and disgusted by the very thing they are doing.\n\nStephen Lett and the governing body of \u0022Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses\u0022 take it to a new level - a new low. The hypocrisy is astounding, yet not surprising.\n\n____________________________\n\nDue to serious illness I am struggling to produce videos every day (as usual) or to work otherwise.

The historical record of the 20th century answers: only Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.\nWatchtower \u2013 April 1, 1992, p12 par14\n\nIn 1931, the name Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses was adopted by the Bible Students. Afterward, many letters of appreciation were published in this journal. \u201CThe good news that we are \u2018Jehovah\u2019s witnesses\u2019 has thrilled us, and filled us with renewed determination to be worthy of the new name,\u201D wrote one congregation from Canada.\nWatchtower \u2013 July 15, 2014, p24 par3\n\nJEHOVAH GOD is the Grand Identifier of his true messengers. He identifies them by making the messages he delivers through them come true. Jehovah is also the Great Exposer of false messengers. How does he expose them? He frustrates their signs and predictions. In this way he shows that they are self-appointed prognosticators, whose messages really spring from their own false reasoning\u2014yes, their foolish, fleshly thinking!\nWatchtower - May 1, 1997, p8 par1\n\nReports are heard of brothers selling their homes and property and planning to finish out the rest of their days in this old system in the pioneer service. Certainly this is a fine way to spend the short time remaining before the wicked world\u2019s end.\n\nBe not surprised, then, when in subsequent chapters we present proofs that the setting up of the Kingdom of God is already begun, that it is pointed out in prophecy as due to begin the exercise of power in A.D. 1878, and that the \u0027battle of the great day of God Almighty (Rev. 16:14) which will end in A.D. 1914 with the complete overthrow of earth\u0027s present rulership, is already commenced.\nThe Time Is At Hand, 1889 Ed., p. 101.\n\nIn view of this strong Bible evidence concerning the Times of the Gentiles, we consider it an established truth that the final end of the kingdoms of this world, and the full establishment of the kingdom of God, will be accomplished near the end of A.D. 1915.\nThe Time Is At Hand, 1915 edition, p. 99\n\nAlso, in the year 1918, when God destroys the churches wholesale, and the church members by millions, it shall be that any that escape shall come to the works of Pastor Russell, to learn the meaning of the downfall of Christianity.\nThe Finished Mystery, p485\n\nThe period must end in 1925. The type ending, the antitype must begin; and therefore 1925 is definitely fixed in the scriptures. every thinking person can see that a great climax is at hand. The Scriptures clearly indicate that the climax is the fall of Satan\u0027s empire, and the full establishment of the Messianic kingdom. This climax being reached by 1925\nGolden Age, Jan. 4, 1922, p. 217\n\nTherefore we may confidently expect that 1925 will mark the return of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and the faithful prophets of old. \nMillions Now Living Will Never Die, pp89-90",
