      "title": "Inside the California Trans Cult Behind Four Murders",
      "description": "A transgender radical cult in California is reportedly behind four recent murders: Two in Pennsylvania, one in Vermont, and one in California. The name of the cult is the Zizians.\n\nThe Zizians are a radical offshoot of the rationalist movement in the Bay Area. Rationalism dates back to Descartes and has recently experienced a resurgence in Silicon Valley, attracting adherents like Sam Bankman-Fried and funders like Peter Thiel. Ziz, the leader of the eponymous Zizians, started beefing with the rationalists at Berkeley and formed her own cult: One that was vegan, transgender, and... violent. \n\nThis video investigates the Zizians, their history, and the spree of murders they\u0027re allegedly behind.\n\n0:00 - Intro\n2:11 - Berkeley Protest\n2:38 - Rationalism\n3:03 - Ziz\u0027s Blog\n4:02 - The Zizians\n4:54 - Ziz Fakes Death\n6:02 - Samurai Sword Attack\n7:02 - Vallejo Murder\n8:37 - Vermont Murder\n9:42 - Pennsylvania Murder\n10:39 - Ziz Returns\n11:44 - Questions\n\nCan\u0027t wait to read your comments on this one.
