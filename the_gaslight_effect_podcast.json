Sarah McCammon is not just a seasoned journalist; she\u0027s also a voice of insight and understanding in the midst of today\u0027s tumultuous political landscape. But what sets her apart is her personal journey\u2014a journey that intersects faith, culture, and the very fabric of American society. Growing up in the heartland of Kansas City, Missouri, Sarah was immersed in an evangelical Christian community that taught her to fear God and never question her faith. But her worldview shifted when she ventured beyond the confines of her upbringing. It was during her time in the Senate Page Program, living in Washington, D.C., that she began to confront the complexities of belief and identity head-on. Now, as a national political correspondent for NPR, Sarah brings a unique perspective to her reporting, drawing from her own experiences to shed light on the intersections of religion and politics in America. Her latest endeavor, the groundbreaking book \u0022The Exvangelicals: Loving, Living, and Leaving the White Evangelical Church,\u0022 delves into the stories of those who, like herself, have grappled with their faith and ultimately forged a new path forward. Join us as we explore Sarah McCammon\u0027s journey from evangelicalism to advocacy, uncovering the gaslighting tactics that have shaped our political discourse and the resilience of those who dare to challenge the status quo.

      "description": "On this episode, Dr. Robin Stern is honored to be joined by two extraordinary individuals whose resilience and courage have transformed their experiences into beacons of hope. Sarah Edmondson , a Canadian actress known for her roles in CBS\u0027s \u0022Salvation\u0022 and numerous Hallmark Channel and Lifetime films, embarked on a journey of self-discovery when she encountered NXIVM , a personal development company led by Keith Raniere , promising the keys to unlocking human potential. Alongside her husband and former college athlete, Anthony \u0022Nippy\u0022 Ames , Sarah delved deep into NXIVM\u0027s teachings. Rising through the ranks, they both became integral figures within the organization, with Anthony drawn to its goals program and Sarah operating her own center in Vancouver. However, their seemingly idyllic journey took a dark turn when they uncovered the truth behind NXIVM\u0027s facade. With courage and determination, Sarah blew the whistle on the organization\u0027s gaslighting and abusive practices, while Anthony wasted no time in helping burn its carefully constructed public image to the ground. In 2019, Sarah published Scarred: The True Story of How I Escaped NXIVM, the Cult that Bound My Life, with Kristine Gasbarre. In this tell-all memoir, she shares her story from the moment she takes her first seminar to her harrowing fight to get out. Sarah and Anthony\u0027s full story as whistleblowers is featured in The Vow , the critically acclaimed HBO documentary series on NXIVM. Also be sure to check out Sarah\u0027s powerful TED Talk about How To Spot A Cult . Now, as hosts of the enlightening podcast \u0022A Little Bit Culty,\u0022 Sarah and Anthony continue to shine a light on the healing process, engaging with experts and fellow survivors to navigate the complexities of recovery and resilience. Join Robin as she delves into the depths of gaslighting and coercion with Sarah Edmondson and Anthony \u0022Nippy\u0022 Ames, and explores how they emerged with newfound understanding and empowerment.

Alice discussed how growing up as a teenager in the 1970s, she was aware of the culture shift that was occuring at that time in our country, and how her father struggled with this changing dynamic.\u00A0 Alice recalled often being told she was wrong by her father, about certain opinions she was formulating at that time, and how that did not leave her unscathed.\u00A0 Alice and Robin unpacked Alice\u0027s feelings of being \u0022wrong\u0022 and how that has impacted her adult life. Alice shared a deeply personal account of when her nephew recently passed away at a young age from COVID and how she felt she couldn\u0027t say the right words to comfort her sister in her grief, and how this stirred up deeply emotional feelings of not being good enough.\u00A0 Alice also shared that at the same time, her marriage was going through a difficult time, and how she was being gaslighted by her partner regarding their relationship.\u00A0 Robin and Alice worked through the the idea that these multiple experiences of gaslighting can cause you to think that maybe you are wrong, and to second guess your own reasoning. Often, giving yourself space allows you to gain a better understanding of what is happening and spurs you to change or get out of the gaslighting situation.\u00A0 Alice shared how understanding what gaslighting means and what to look for, has helped her in raising her daughters in these unsettled times during the pandemic and post pandemic,\u00A0when we\u00A0 often are told to believe things that are constantly changing and things that we know are not accurate.\u00A0 To read the full transcript of this episode and to listen to other episodes, please head over to robinstern.com.\u00A0 And don\u0027t forget to leave a rating and review wherever you listen to this podcast!\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0",
