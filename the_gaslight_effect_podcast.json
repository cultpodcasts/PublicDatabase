      "description": "On this episode of The Gaslight Effect Podcast, Dr. Robin Stern sits down with behavioral economist and bestselling author Daniel Ariely \u2014whose books Misbelief, Predictably Irrational and The Honest Truth About Dishonesty have upended the way we think about decision-making\u2014to expose how gaslighting operates not only between individuals but on a mass scale. Drawing on his own experience of being targeted by conspiracy theories during the pandemic, Ariely reveals how fear and simple narratives can be weaponized to warp our perception of reality and undermine our trust in what we \u201Cknow.\u201D Together, Robin and Daniel demonstrate how our overconfidence in everyday knowledge\u2014what he calls the \u201Cillusion of explanatory depth\u201D\u2014becomes a prime tool for manipulative voices that twist facts into a distorted mirror. They delve into experiments on social exclusion, showing how even a casual frisbee-toss rejection can prime us for the seductive comfort of echo chambers that subtly gaslight us into conformity. And they unpack the hidden loyalty tests that masquerade as harmless identity checks but really serve to isolate and control. By the end of this conversation, you\u2019ll be armed with research-backed strategies for spotting when the narrative is being rewritten around you. From asking the right questions (\u201CHow do you really know?\u201D) to setting firm personal boundaries, Dr. Stern and Ariely guide you in reclaiming your own perceptions and standing strong against emotional distortion\u2014whether it comes from someone close or the stories unfolding in the news. Listen now to illuminate the hidden mechanics of gaslighting and reclaim the power of clear, rational thinking. To read the full transcript of this episode, head over to robinstern.com .

      "description": "On this episode of The Gaslight Effect podcast, Dr. Robin Stern welcomes Dr. Zorana Ivcevic Pringle , Senior Research Scientist at the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, for a powerful conversation about how gaslighting\u2014especially the kind we direct at ourselves\u2014can sabotage creativity. Together, they examine the subtle but damaging effects of internal gaslighting: the self-doubt, second-guessing, and emotional suppression that keep us from pursuing creative ideas or expressing ourselves fully. Dr. Pringle explains how emotional intelligence can help us recognize these internalized messages, regulate our emotional responses, and build the resilience needed to move forward. Drawing on her research and her new book The Creativity Choice, Dr. Pringle reframes creativity as a conscious, ongoing decision\u2014one that can be strengthened through emotional awareness and social support. She and Dr. Stern explore how language, mood, and even cultural expressions influence the way we relate to our emotions and creative work. Listeners will walk away with practical insights on how to: Identify and interrupt patterns of internal gaslighting Use emotional intelligence as a creative tool Shift from fear and self-censorship toward creative confidence and clarity Whether you\u0027re an artist, educator, leader, or someone rebuilding a sense of self after emotional manipulation, this episode offers empowering guidance on how to reclaim your voice and your creative power.

Sarah McCammon is not just a seasoned journalist; she\u0027s also a voice of insight and understanding in the midst of today\u0027s tumultuous political landscape. But what sets her apart is her personal journey\u2014a journey that intersects faith, culture, and the very fabric of American society. Growing up in the heartland of Kansas City, Missouri, Sarah was immersed in an evangelical Christian community that taught her to fear God and never question her faith. But her worldview shifted when she ventured beyond the confines of her upbringing. It was during her time in the Senate Page Program, living in Washington, D.C., that she began to confront the complexities of belief and identity head-on. Now, as a national political correspondent for NPR, Sarah brings a unique perspective to her reporting, drawing from her own experiences to shed light on the intersections of religion and politics in America. Her latest endeavor, the groundbreaking book \u0022The Exvangelicals: Loving, Living, and Leaving the White Evangelical Church,\u0022 delves into the stories of those who, like herself, have grappled with their faith and ultimately forged a new path forward. Join us as we explore Sarah McCammon\u0027s journey from evangelicalism to advocacy, uncovering the gaslighting tactics that have shaped our political discourse and the resilience of those who dare to challenge the status quo.

      "description": "On this episode, Dr. Robin Stern is honored to be joined by two extraordinary individuals whose resilience and courage have transformed their experiences into beacons of hope. Sarah Edmondson , a Canadian actress known for her roles in CBS\u0027s \u0022Salvation\u0022 and numerous Hallmark Channel and Lifetime films, embarked on a journey of self-discovery when she encountered NXIVM , a personal development company led by Keith Raniere , promising the keys to unlocking human potential. Alongside her husband and former college athlete, Anthony \u0022Nippy\u0022 Ames , Sarah delved deep into NXIVM\u0027s teachings. Rising through the ranks, they both became integral figures within the organization, with Anthony drawn to its goals program and Sarah operating her own center in Vancouver. However, their seemingly idyllic journey took a dark turn when they uncovered the truth behind NXIVM\u0027s facade. With courage and determination, Sarah blew the whistle on the organization\u0027s gaslighting and abusive practices, while Anthony wasted no time in helping burn its carefully constructed public image to the ground. In 2019, Sarah published Scarred: The True Story of How I Escaped NXIVM, the Cult that Bound My Life, with Kristine Gasbarre. In this tell-all memoir, she shares her story from the moment she takes her first seminar to her harrowing fight to get out. Sarah and Anthony\u0027s full story as whistleblowers is featured in The Vow , the critically acclaimed HBO documentary series on NXIVM. Also be sure to check out Sarah\u0027s powerful TED Talk about How To Spot A Cult . Now, as hosts of the enlightening podcast \u0022A Little Bit Culty,\u0022 Sarah and Anthony continue to shine a light on the healing process, engaging with experts and fellow survivors to navigate the complexities of recovery and resilience. Join Robin as she delves into the depths of gaslighting and coercion with Sarah Edmondson and Anthony \u0022Nippy\u0022 Ames, and explores how they emerged with newfound understanding and empowerment.

      "description": "On this episode, Dr. Robin Stern talked with her close friend and colleague, Alice Forrester, the CEO of Clifford Beers Community Health Partners. Alice discussed how growing up as a teenager in the 1970s, she was aware of the culture shift that was occuring at that time in our country, and how her father struggled with this changing dynamic.\u00A0 Alice recalled often being told she was wrong by her father, about certain opinions she was formulating at that time, and how that did not leave her unscathed.\u00A0 Alice and Robin unpacked Alice\u0027s feelings of being \u0022wrong\u0022 and how that has impacted her adult life. Alice shared a deeply personal account of when her nephew recently passed away at a young age from COVID and how she felt she couldn\u0027t say the right words to comfort her sister in her grief, and how this stirred up deeply emotional feelings of not being good enough.\u00A0 Alice also shared that at the same time, her marriage was going through a difficult time, and how she was being gaslighted by her partner regarding their relationship.\u00A0 Robin and Alice worked through the the idea that these multiple experiences of gaslighting can cause you to think that maybe you are wrong, and to second guess your own reasoning. Often, giving yourself space allows you to gain a better understanding of what is happening and spurs you to change or get out of the gaslighting situation.\u00A0 Alice shared how understanding what gaslighting means and what to look for, has helped her in raising her daughters in these unsettled times during the pandemic and post pandemic,\u00A0when we\u00A0 often are told to believe things that are constantly changing and things that we know are not accurate.\u00A0 To read the full transcript of this episode and to listen to other episodes, please head over to robinstern.com.\u00A0 And don\u0027t forget to leave a rating and review wherever you listen to this podcast!\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0",
