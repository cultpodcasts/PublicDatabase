      "description": "Leaving a religious cult, fundamentalist church, or high-control faith environment doesn\u2019t always bring the relief people expect.\n\nFor many people raised in evangelical, fundamentalist, or authoritarian religious systems, the effects of religious trauma, church harm, and faith-based harm don\u2019t show up right away. They often surface years later, when life finally slows down enough for the body and mind to catch up.\n\nIn this episode, cult survivor and bestselling author, Lilia Tarawa, responds to listener questions about religious trauma, belief, and healing after faith-based harm. These are questions asked repeatedly by people trying to make sense of themselves after leaving religion, especially those who grew up in religious cults or rigid church systems.\n\nThis conversation focuses on what happens after you leave. \n\u2753 How do you navigate belief after psychiatric and psychological harm linked to religion?\n\u2753 Why do so many capable, self-aware people still struggle long after walking away from church or faith?\n\nIn this episode, we discuss:\n\u2753 Why religious trauma lingers even when you\u2019re no longer part of the church or cult\n\u2753 What makes church harm and faith-based harm so hard to explain to others\n\u2753 Why being told to forgive, move on, or have more faith can make things worse\n\u2753 What happens when professionals acknowledge harm, but there is no clear pathway for repair or justice\n\u2753 Why asking for help can feel complicated after religious cults or fundamentalist environments\n\u2753 How faith, doubt, and curiosity change after harm\n\u2753 What makes church harm and faith-based harm so difficult to explain to others\n\u2753 Why asking for help can feel complicated after religious cults, evangelical churches, or fundamentalist environments\n\nThis episode is for people who:\n\uD83D\uDC49 Were raised in religious cults or high-control faith environments\n\uD83D\uDC49 Experienced religious trauma, church harm or faith-based harm\n\uD83D\uDC49 Left an evangelical or fundamentalist church but still feel affected\n\uD83D\uDC49 Are trying to figure out what they believe without being pressured\n\uD83D\uDC49 Are navigating belief, doubt or spirituality without wanting to be preached at\n\uD83D\uDC49 Feel family or community pressure to conform to religious beliefs or ideologies\n\nListener care note\nThis episode discusses religious trauma, church harm, and faith-based harm.
