      "description": "Want to know what it\u0027s REALLY like for young performers trying to break into the business? This is one of my favorite conversations and one that was long overdue for me personally. Was I almost trafficked to Toby McGuire at a Diddy Grammy party? Should Molly have given Jimmy Walker (DYNOMIIIIIITE!!!) that bj so she could win the pageant? Should she have signed that contract to be the perfect \u0022girlfriend experience\u0022? What does sex have to do with singing? Where are the safeguards? Why does everyone turn a blind eye to this? The amount of times that Molly has been targeted, trafficked, and abused on her journey as a classically trained professional singer is outrageous, but not at all surprising. Even Ghislaine Maxwell makes a cameo in Molly\u0027s story. You don\u0027t want to miss this one.\n\nFollow Molly Skye Brown:\n\u2060@SurvivorSingh-1\u2060\n\u2060https://linktr.ee/MollySkyeBrown\u2060\n\nSubscribe to this channel.\nFollow Mel on X: @ThatsFunnyMel\nBuy Mel a Coffee: \u2060https://buymeacoffee.com/ThatsFunnyMel\u2060\nOther Shows-Mel\u2019s Linktree: \u2060https://linktr.ee/ThatsFunnyMel\u2060\nMel\u2019s Avon Boutique: \u2060https://www.avon.com/repstore/meljean?rep=meljean\u2060",

Ashley Hoff A. Ashley Hoff is the author of Match Game 101: A Backstage History of Match Game and My Huckleberry Friend: Holly Golightly and the Untold History of Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s. He previously worked for talent agencies in Chicago and Los Angeles and has written articles on Hollywood for The Advocate and Films in Review. He has been interviewed on numerous pop culture subjects on The Nick Digilio Show on WGN Radio, The Frank DeCaro Show on Sirius XM, Feast of Fun on iTunes, in magazines such as Closer Weekly, and on various local talk shows and podcasts. __________________________ When she died in 1977, Joan Crawford was remembered as an icon of Hollywood\u0027s Golden Age\u2014until publication the following year of her daughter\u2019s memoir, Mommie Dearest. Christina Crawford\u2019s book was an immediate bestseller, addressing the infrequently discussed topic of child abuse. When Paramount Pictures released the film, starring Faye Dunaway as Crawford, it was critically panned, and remains one of the most legendary critical bombs in film history. The lavish, big-screen adaptation drew unexpected laughter in the scenes depicting life in the Crawford household. Rarely have such good intentions been met with such ridicule. Despite this, the movie was a commercial success and remains, four decades later, immensely popular. With Love, Mommie Dearest details the writing and selling of Christina\u0027s book and the aftermath of its publication, as well as the filming of the motion picture, whose backstage drama almost surpassed what was viewed onscreen in the film. Based on new interviews with people connected to the book and the film, Hollywood historian A. Ashley Hoff explores the phenomenon, the camp, and the very real social issues addressed by the book and film. A.
