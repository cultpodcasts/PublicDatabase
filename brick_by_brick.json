      "description": "This was a great open conversation with an active elder. Just stunning dialogue about how the NWT was mistranslated. A few topics covered. We left on friendly terms, and agreed to talk again. He seems like a genuinely nice human being. \n\nSorry about the camera angle, i need to learn how to edit videos properly!\n\nI look forward to the return visit \uD83D\uDE0E",
