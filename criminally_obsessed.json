      "description": "\u0022It\u0027s abuse that doesn\u0027t leave marks on the body.\u0022 \n\nStalking, harassing, intimidating, manipulation: These are all things investigators say Myrtle Beach Pastor John-Paul Miller did to his estranged wife who\u0027s now dead. \n\nMica Miller, also known as Mica Francis, took her own life in April 2024. According to a two count federal grand jury indictment against Miller, he cyberstalked Mica from November 16th 2022 until the day she died.  It lasted 528 days. But, he didn\u0027t just watch or follow her. Instead they say he tracked her, called her repeatedly, interfered with her finances, threatened her, damaged her tires, and posted nude photos of her online and then lied about it.  \n\nWhile it took the feds 19 months to bring charges, Mica\u0027s attorney, Regina Ward couldn\u0027t be happier that Miller will be prosecuted. She called the level of abuse Mica suffered, \u0022jaw dropping\u0022 and wouldn\u0027t be surprised if more charges are filed.   \n\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing a mental struggles, you can call, chat or text the 988 Lifeline for help.
