      "description": "Pope Francis has passed. And as someone who was once on the path to becoming a conservative Catholic priest\u2014and now lives openly as a gay man\u2014his death hits hard. In this video, I break down what Pope Francis actually did for LGBTQ Catholics. From his famous \u201CWho am I to judge?\u201D to his quiet yet revolutionary support of queer ministries, this pope changed the vibe of the church, even if he never changed the doctrine. For outsiders, it may be hard to grasp how radical just saying \u201CYou are welcome here\u201D really was. In this episode, I reflect on his legacy, what\u2019s at stake in the election of the next pope, and why so many LGBTQ Catholics now feel uncertain and afraid.

Michael and I come from the same religious movement, and I used to believe the same things he argues today. But as I studied philosophy and deconstructed my faith, I realized just how flimsy these arguments are.

This approach fails in so many ways, and I don\u0027t think chairs are our best proof of teleology. I (a gay ex-traditional catholic apologist) give my reaction to his wild takes on teleology. This is the talk that convinced me when I was much younger to not be gay, so I figured I\u0027d be fun to start my video-essays with an emotional reaction to his talk. 00:00-01:12 - intro 01:12-03:35 - don\u2019t violate the nature of things 03:35-04:44 - sex is only for procreation 06:44-08:44 - his brother came out as gay 08:44-10:33 - settle with just being friends 10:33-11:45 - just be happy 11:46-12:25 - my thoughts as a gay ex-catholic To join our discord community for $1 or to support my work/get early access to content, check out my patreon: https://www.patreon.com/c/gayextrad To be a guest on the episode, visit my YT channel and send me an email.",
