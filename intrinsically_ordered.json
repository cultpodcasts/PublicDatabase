What followed was a painful process of leaving not just Catholicism, but religion itself. I open up about the collapse of my community, meaning, and identity\u2014and how I rebuilt my life through running ultramarathons, reconnecting with purpose, and creating content to help others on their journey.

      "description": "Pope Francis has passed. And as someone who was once on the path to becoming a conservative Catholic priest\u2014and now lives openly as a gay man\u2014his death hits hard. In this video, I break down what Pope Francis actually did for LGBTQ Catholics. From his famous \u201CWho am I to judge?\u201D to his quiet yet revolutionary support of queer ministries, this pope changed the vibe of the church, even if he never changed the doctrine. For outsiders, it may be hard to grasp how radical just saying \u201CYou are welcome here\u201D really was. In this episode, I reflect on his legacy, what\u2019s at stake in the election of the next pope, and why so many LGBTQ Catholics now feel uncertain and afraid.

Yes, this video is directly attacking church teaching and is quite condescending. Why? This teaching, more than almost any other, destroys peoples\u0027 lives and takes away peoples\u0027 rights. I\u0027m a fan of people choosing religious beliefs that work for them, but this realm is perhaps one of the worst parts of catholicism. Hence, the forceful speaking out.
