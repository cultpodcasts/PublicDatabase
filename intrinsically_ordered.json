      "description": "In this video, I break down my debate with Michael Knowles on Jubilee about the topic of same-sex marriage, philosophy, and conservative ideology. We go deep into metaphysics, logic, and how anti-LGBT arguments are structured to sound airtight\u2014but fall apart under scrutiny. Michael and I come from the same religious movement, and I used to believe the same things he argues today. But as I studied philosophy and deconstructed my faith, I realized just how flimsy these arguments are. Stick with me as we explore nominalism vs. realism, the Texas sharpshooter fallacy, and why Michael\u2019s claims on metaphysical reality don\u2019t hold up. This video will equip you to counter these arguments in everyday conversations and protect our rights from bad-faith actors. 00:00 - Introduction: My Debate with Michael Knowles 02:30 - The Core Argument: Does Gay Marriage Exist? 06:45 - Michael\u2019s First Mistake: The Realism vs. Nominalism Trap 11:20 - The Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy: Cherry-Picking History 15:55 - Why Metaphysics Can\u2019t Define Legal Marriage 21:10 - The Logical Impossibility Fallacy (And Why It\u2019s B.S.) 26:40 - Why Michael\u2019s Argument is Ultimately Religious, Not Logical 32:15 - Final Thoughts: How to Counter These Arguments IRL To join our discord community for $1 or to support my work/get early access to content, check out my patreon: https://www.patreon.com/c/gayextrad To be a guest on the episode, visit my YT channel and send me an email.",

Yes, this video is directly attacking church teaching and is quite condescending. Why? This teaching, more than almost any other, destroys peoples\u0027 lives and takes away peoples\u0027 rights. I\u0027m a fan of people choosing religious beliefs that work for them, but this realm is perhaps one of the worst parts of catholicism. Hence, the forceful speaking out.
