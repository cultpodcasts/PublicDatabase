      "description": "In a stark and emotional conversation hosted around a cosy bonfire, Eden Moody talks about her life-changing experience of escaping from a notorious cult Children of God and her struggles of surviving through it. Eden shares how her foray into music helped her overcome the experience and started offering her a means to heal. She discusses the importance of forgiveness, curiosity, and the power of joy in transforming one\u0027s life. Dealing with depression and other mental health struggles, her journey to faith, and the role of determination, inspiration and faith in her journey towards personal freedom, are discussed in detail.
