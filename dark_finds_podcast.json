Claire shares her experiences as a cult survivor, discussing the gradual process of becoming involved in a cult, the psychological manipulation at play, and the personal struggles she faced. She highlights the role of predictions made by cult leaders, the fear instilled in members, and the societal changes that influenced cult dynamics. Claire emphasizes the importance of understanding vulnerability and the impact of fear on decision-making, as well as her journey towards reclaiming her identity and voice after leaving the cult.

      "description": "On this week\u2019s episode, I\u2019m joined by Ben Shenton. Ben is a survivor of \u0022The Family,\u0022 a notorious New Age cult led by Anne Hamilton-Byrne. At 18 months old, Ben was handed over to Hamilton-Byrne, who falsely claimed to be his mother. Within the cult, children were subjected to severe abuse, including forced conformity through identical appearances and strict discipline. In 1987, at age 15, Shenton was among several children rescued during a police raid on the cult\u0027s property. \u200BBen has since become an advocate for survivors of cults and abusive environments and works now as a pastor. He authored the book Life Behind The Wire, detailing his experiences within \u0022The Family\u0022 and his journey toward healing.
