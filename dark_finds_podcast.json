      "description": "My guest today is Daniella Mistyanek Young, and her story doesn\u2019t begin with a bad decision, a vulnerable moment, or a charismatic stranger at the door\u2026it begins at birth, inside one of the most infamous modern cults in history: The Children of God. In this conversation, Daniella takes us inside a world built on control, self-sacrifice, and the slow erasure of identity, where loyalty is demanded, individuality is treated like a threat, and your value is measured by what you can give\u2026 and what you can be made to endure. After escaping, Daniella joined the military sometime after, and began to see parallels between that institution and the one she had escaped - the strict structure, the chain of command, and the dissolution of identity. We also delve into how cults recruit in times of social chaos, how the internet has transformed modern indoctrination, why so many \u201Ctransformation\u201D movements feel like grifts, and the red flags that can help you spot coercion before it\u2019s too late.

Cults exploit individuals during times of social turmoil. The internet has changed the landscape of cult recruitment. Self-sacrifice is a key element in cult indoctrination. Cults are often about labor exploitation, not just belief. Charismatic leaders manipulate followers for power. The military can exhibit cult-like characteristics. Cults can exist in corporate environments as well. Personal identity is often lost in cults and total institutions. Awareness of cult-like behavior is crucial for personal safety.

      "description": "On this week\u2019s episode, I\u2019m joined by Ben Shenton. Ben is a survivor of \u0022The Family,\u0022 a notorious New Age cult led by Anne Hamilton-Byrne. At 18 months old, Ben was handed over to Hamilton-Byrne, who falsely claimed to be his mother. Within the cult, children were subjected to severe abuse, including forced conformity through identical appearances and strict discipline. In 1987, at age 15, Shenton was among several children rescued during a police raid on the cult\u0027s property. \u200BBen has since become an advocate for survivors of cults and abusive environments and works now as a pastor. He authored the book Life Behind The Wire, detailing his experiences within \u0022The Family\u0022 and his journey toward healing.
