      "description": "If you know nothing about the Zizian Cult, well then you are in for a real eye opener.  Joining us tonight are the brilliant and fabulous hosts of LA Not So Confidential Podcast, Dr. Shiloh and Dr. Scott!  I tried to get them to talk Kohberger but they said, you know what...we think we need to talk to about the Zizians.  I had heard nothing about this fiendish crew out of California but I did a little digging and I\u0027m very intrigued and I cannot think of anyone better to discuss this subject matter with than two forensic psychologists who are both so learned and fascinating to listen to that y\u0027all are going to wish this was a 5 hour live.\n\n#ZizianCult #Cults #truecrimecommunity #legalanalysis #pyschology #forensicscience #defensediaries",
