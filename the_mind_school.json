      "description": "Hey legend \u0026#x1f44b; This weeks episode is your official permission slip to build a business that doesn\u2019t give you the ick. You know what I\u2019m talking about: \u0026#x1f449; The weird sales call tactics that feel like a performance \u0026#x1f449; The cringey way to \u0022handle objections\u0022 \u0026#x1f449; The coaching scripts that promise \u201Cresults\u201D but miss the soul \u0026#x1f449; The mentors who seem more invested in their Stripe screenshots than your growth Yeah. That. This week, The Mind School School Consellor, Courney, \u0026 I sit down to chat about the stuff nobody talks about enough: \u0026#x1f4ad; Why some coaching feels off (and what to do about it) \u0026#x1f4ad; The darker side of NLP, and how to practice it ethically \u0026#x1f4ad; Red flags to watch for when choosing a mentor or program \u0026#x1f4ad; Why you don\u2019t need to \u201Cfix\u201D anyone to be a powerful coach \u0026#x1f4ad; The missing piece of the coaching puzzle that we teach inside The Mind School (that no one else does) If you\u2019ve ever wondered what makes The Mind School Method different, this episode will show you. Spoiler: It\u2019s not scripts. It\u2019s not formulas. It\u2019s not \u201Cdo this, say that.\u201D It\u2019s real tools, taught with real heart. Whether you\u2019re deep in the coaching game or just getting started, this episode is gonna shift something in you. \u0026#x1f3a7; [Listen now] \u0026#x1f525; And if it hits\u2026 come chat to Court about joining us this June in Perth. No pitch. Just a convo. Book your call now. Big love, Breanna x As always, please don\u0027t forget to hit Subscribe! xxx",
