If you grew up in evangelicalism, and likely even if you didn\u2019t, you\u2019re sure to be familiar with Joshua Harris, author of the wildly popular Christian dating, ahem, courting, book, I Kissed Dating Goodbye. He\u2019s here to share with us about his time inside of high control religion, what opened his eyes to the unhealthy dynamics inside the church and his process of healing after leaving.

      "description": "In this episode, Laura and Andrew engage in a lively discussion with Janice Lagata about her experiences growing up in evangelicalism, her time at Hillsong College, and the importance of literature and financial therapy. They explore themes of banned books, free speech, and the influence of worship music on personal faith. The conversation is rich with insights and personal anecdotes, making it a compelling listen for anyone interested in the intersections of faith, culture, and personal growth.\nIn this conversation, Janice Lagata shares her journey from moving to New York and joining Hillsong to her struggles with church culture, identity, and the impact of purity culture. She reflects on her experiences within a male-dominated evangelical space, the expectations placed on women, and the burden of not having a personal testimony. Janice discusses her eventual departure from Hillsong, seeking healthier communities, and the complexities of serving in church environments that demand much while often perpetuating shame. In this conversation, the speakers delve into the complexities of faith, race, and the intersections of capitalism and evangelicalism.\nThey explore the trials of personal transformation, the cultural discrepancies faced by people of color in faith communities, and the problematic nature of church planting. The discussion also highlights the spiritual capitalism inherent in evangelicalism and the stagnation observed in deconstruction spaces, ultimately questioning the authenticity of new leadership dynamics. In this conversation, Laura Anderson and Janice Lagata explore the complexities of leaving evangelicalism, addressing themes such as embodied fundamentalism, the impact of capitalism, the challenges of grifting, and the role of privilege in ex-vangelical spaces. They emphasize the importance of personal responsibility, community, and self-trust in the deconstruction journey, while also recognizing the need for diverse voices and perspectives in these discussions.\nTo connect with Janice, check out her website: https://janicelagata.com/ \u2013from there you can join her Patreon, Substack, and hear about the other cool projects and offerings she has!\nThis podcast is brought to you by the Center for Trauma Resolution and Recovery: an online trauma coaching company whose practitioners are trauma informed and trauma trained to work with individuals, couples and families who have experienced high control religion, cults, and religious trauma.

Sarah, author of Giving Up God, opens up about her upbringing in the Evangelical Free Church and the slow, freeing path of deconstruction that followed. She reflects on purity culture, youth group experiences, and the internal conflicts that led her to start questioning her faith. We also talk about what it\u2019s like to navigate relationships\u2014especially marriage\u2014when belief systems diverge. Sarah shares how she\u2019s held onto values like love, humility, and generosity, even as her theology shifted.

      "description": "We are thrilled to have with us today Dr. Tina Schermer Seller who is an author, researcher, professor, and psychotherapist specializing in the impacts of purity culture, shame resilience, gender, and sexuality. In this episode, Dr. Tina shares her research and how she came to realize the psychological and physiological impact of purity culture and how that shaped the direction of her work with clients, students, and her writing. In the episode, Dr. Tina shares an incredible definition of sexual shame (see below) that can help us understand the felt sense experience of purity culture! But before we talk to Dr. Tina, we have a vocabulary lesson on what are porn and sex addictions really and why religion is so quick to diagnoses people with them, and we\u2019ll also be taking some prayer requests! This is an episode you won\u2019t want to miss! Dr. Tina\u2019s definition of sexual shame (taken from the dissertation of Noel Clarke): Sexual shame is a visceral feeling of humiliation and disgust toward one\u2019s own body and identity as a sexual being and a belief of being abnormal, inferior and unworthy. this feeling can be internalized but also manifests in interpersonal relationships having a negative impact on trust, communication, and physical and emotional intimacy. Sexual shame develops across the lifespan in interactions with interpersonal relationships, one\u2019s culture and society, and subsequent critical self-appraisal (a continuous feedback loop). There is also a fear and uncertainty related to one\u2019s power or right to make decisions, including safety decisions, related to sexual encounters, along with an internalized judgement toward one\u2019s own sexual desire.

He shares his experiences navigating legalism, spiritual abuse, and the pressure to conform, including his time at Bob Jones University and the emotional toll of leaving such a high-control environment. Andrew discusses the coping mechanisms he developed, such as dissociation, and how creativity, storytelling, and community have played a vital role in his healing. Through vulnerability and reflection, he offers encouragement to others seeking freedom, self-acceptance, and authentic love beyond oppressive systems.

She discusses the unique aspects of Adventism, the impact it had on her identity, and the process of deconstructing her beliefs. Melissa emphasizes the importance of finding joy and freedom after leaving a high-control environment and the need for support systems for those transitioning out of similar backgrounds. In this conversation, Melissa Duge Spiers and Andrew Kerbs explore the complexities of deconstructing from the Adventist faith, discussing themes of social isolation, the impact of self-supporting schools, and the church\u0027s missionary zeal. They delve into the ethical implications of Adventist outreach, connections to controversial groups like the Branch Davidians, and the painful yet necessary process of deconstruction. The conversation also touches on the importance of therapy and support in recovery, culminating in Melissa\u0027s journey of writing a memoir about her experiences.

Or maybe you still feel the need to obey your parents even if you are an adult (and with your own children!) On today\u2019s episode of Sunday School Dropouts we\u2019ll be talking about the parent-child dynamic within high control religion\u2013the way it impacts a child and how that impact lingers on into adulthood. Whether it\u2019s the way you navigate relationships today or your sense of confidence in the world, how you interacted with your parents as a child impacts you today. And when you add high control religion on top of it, there is an even bigger impact! We\u2019re excited that Megan Von Fricken, who is, herself, a Sunday School Dropout, will be joining us today to talk about this from a clinical perspective and will share some ways that people can begin healing from this dynamic.

We are talking about all things White Christian Nationalism, including the origins, impacts, and how to heal with Rev. Angela Denker. Angela is the author of \u201CRed State Christians\u201D and the forthcoming book \u201CDisciples of White Jesus\u201D where she writes about the growing phenomenon of White Christian Nationalism and its impact on a specific group of people: White men and boys. Throughout this conversation we begin to see how this extremist approach began, why it thrives and even how to navigate relationships with people in our lives who live according to those values. Andrew and Laura also discuss the term \u2018gaslighting\u2019 and explain what it truly means\u2013instead of how it\u2019s talked about on social media and in pop culture\u2013as a way to help people better organize and name what happened to them.

We also get into a fascinating discussion regarding how the absence of safe and stable connection can also result in trauma through the topic of lack of sex education in high control religion. We\u2019ll also be bringing to you our first vocabulary lesson of the season, discussing the term \u2018trauma response\u2019.

This week we\u2019ll begin our touchstone topic series with a discussion about what religious trauma is! Our touchstone topic series is one where we talk about some of the foundations of religious trauma, the nervous system, the difference between deconstruction and deconversion, and adverse religious experiences. And we\u2019re also bringing back some of your favorite segments! In this episode we have Flannelgraph Storytime where we have a fascinating discussion on the impact of James Dobson and the Strong Willed Child propaganda. And, we can\u2019t forget prayer requests!

      "description": "For those of you who don\u2019t know Josh Harris, he is a former pastor and poster-child of the purity culture movement with his (formerly) best selling book, I Kissed Dating Goodbye, which was published when he was 21\u2013which meant he was even younger when he wrote it\u2013like 19 years old!. The book and the pastors around him gave Josh a national platform where he was looked to as an authority and subsequently, someone whose teachings were incredibly harmful. In 2015, Josh left formal ministry and the United States and just a few years after that Josh and his then wife announced they were dissolving their marriage and Josh began publicly speaking about his faith deconstruction process. Josh has received both welcome and warning from people in post-religious spaces and though he does not consider himself a leader in faith deconstruction spaces, he desires to hold space and hear stories from people who are coming out of these environments\u2013many of whom were deeply harmed by the teachings he was taught, lived, and promoted. In Josh\u2019s words\u2026 \u201CI spent the first 40 years of my life promoting what I now see as narrow, controlling, fear-based religion. Today I\u2019m an advocate for the freedom to change, grow, and walk away from systems and beliefs that no longer fit. I want to see religious and non-religious communities healthier. Stepping outside of rigid religion, I\u2019ve found there\u2019s a lot of room for discovery. For hearing and telling new stories. For creating new things in business. And spotlighting people whose ideas can reshape the world.\u201D This podcast is brought to you by the Center for Trauma Resolution and Recovery: an online trauma coaching company whose practitioners are trauma informed and trauma trained to work with individuals, couples and families who have experienced high control religion, cults, and religious trauma.

      "description": "We are thrilled to have with us today Dr. Tina Schermer Seller who is an author, researcher, professor, and psychotherapist specializing in the impacts of purity culture, shame resilience, gender, and sexuality. In this episode, Dr. Tina shares her research and how she came to realize the psychological and physiological impact of purity culture and how that shaped the direction of her work with clients, students, and her writing. In the episode, Dr. Tina shares an incredible definition of sexual shame (see below) that can help us understand the felt sense experience of purity culture! But before we talk to Dr. Tina, we have a vocabulary lesson on what are porn and sex addictions really and why religion is so quick to diagnoses people with them, and we\u2019ll also be taking some prayer requests! This is an episode you won\u2019t want to miss! Dr. Tina\u2019s definition of sexual shame (taken from the dissertation of Noel Clarke): Sexual shame is a visceral feeling of humiliation and disgust toward one\u2019s own body and identity as a sexual being and a belief of being abnormal, inferior and unworthy. this feeling can be internalized but also manifests in interpersonal relationships having a negative impact on trust, communication, and physical and emotional intimacy. Sexual shame develops across the lifespan in interactions with interpersonal relationships, one\u2019s culture and society, and subsequent critical self-appraisal (a continuous feedback loop). There is also a fear and uncertainty related to one\u2019s power or right to make decisions, including safety decisions, related to sexual encounters, along with an internalized judgement toward one\u2019s own sexual desire.
