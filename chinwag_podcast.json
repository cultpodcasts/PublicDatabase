Hear about Travis the chimpanzee, radical nuns, lice couches, whether the Popes \u0022Netflix and chill,\u0022 and that time Paul fought off kidnapping Krishnas in Northern Ireland!\n\nPaul Giamatti is an award-winning actor and producer, and the self-proclaimed Emperor of Neptune. Stephen Asma is a professor and author specializing in the philosophy of science, religion, and art. He also is the acting Minister of Triton for the Chinwag.\n\nKathryn Hahn starred in Hulu\u2019s \u0022Tiny Beautiful Things\u0022 and next she\u2019ll reprise her iconic role as Agatha Harkness in the Marvel Disney Plus series \u0022Agatha All Along.\u0022\n\n\uD83C\uDFD0\uD83C\uDFD0\uD83C\uDFD0\n\n=========\n\nFor more CHINWAG, you can SUBSCRIBE on any of these NOW  \uD83D\uDC49\uD83C\uDFFC  \n   \u2022  Apple Podcasts: https://apple.co/chinwag\n   \u2022  Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3ZG3auD\n   \u2022  RSS: https://feeds.megaphone.fm/chinwag\n\nOr follow CHINWAG on \uD83D\uDC49\uD83C\uDFFC\n   \u2022  Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/chinwagpod/\n   \u2022  Tiktok: https://tiktok.com/@chinwagpod/\n   \u2022  Site: https://chinwagpod.fm\n\nSend your stories, Qs, or thoughts to \uD83D\uDCE7 questions [at] chinwagpod [dot] fm\n\n=========",
