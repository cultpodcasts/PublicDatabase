One of the most disturbing aspects is the interview with her son Michael. A man who is clearly a victim of the cult\u2019s control and abuse, yet also expresses deeply anti-women beliefs. This video examines how victimhood does not automatically produce accountability, how patriarchal cult structures can harm men while still teaching them to dehumanize women, and why recognizing someone\u2019s trauma does not require excusing the harm they perpetuate. Through a feminist and psychological lens, we unpack how coercive control, religious extremism, and misogyny can coexist and why that nuance matters.\n\n#BrittanySimon #philosophy #cultpsychology #gwendshamblin #weightlosscult #religioustrauma #misogyny #patriarchy #feministanalysis #psychology #coercivecontrol #drewbinsky",
