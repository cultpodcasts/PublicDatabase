As a child, Michelle Dowd grew up on a mountain in the Angeles National Forest. She was born into an ultra-religious cult\u2014or the Field. Michelle lives a life of abuse, poverty, and isolation, as she obeys her family\u2019s rigorous religious and patriarchal rules\u2014which are so extreme that Michelle is convinced her mother would sacrifice her, like Abraham and Isaac, if instructed by God. She often wears the same clothes for months at a time; she is often ill and always hungry for both love and food. She is taught not to trust Outsiders, and especially not Quitters, nor her own body and its warnings.\n\n\u27A1\uFE0FConnect with #MichelleDowd\nhttps://www.michelledowd.org\nHer Book: https://amzn.to/3Ynpa0j\n\n\u27A1\uFE0FConnect with #BertMartinez:\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/BertMartinez\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/TheBertMartinez\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/bertmartinezfans\n\n\u27A1\uFE0F Get a free copy of DominatingYourMind: https://amzn.to/2XuM9Xr\n While supplies last, limited time.\n\nAbout the host:\nBert Martinez is a successful entrepreneur and best-selling author.
