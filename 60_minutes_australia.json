      "description": "What Were They Thinking? One-time sitcom actor and well-known devotee of Scientology, Danny Masterson, is now also a convicted rapist. Last week he was jailed for 30 years for drugging and sexually assaulting two women in 2003. Masterson\u2019s trial attracted enormous attention, not only because of his fame and violent crimes.  The Church of Scientology was also condemned, accused of going to extraordinary lengths to protect its star recruit from prosecution.\n\nBut what\u2019s been revealed since Masterson\u2019s sentencing is causing more controversy.  The disgraced actor received substantial support from fellow Hollywood celebrities including Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis. In letters to the judge asking for leniency for Masterson, the married couple described their friend more like a saint than a sinner. They said he was a role model and an exceptional character. Not surprisingly their comments have caused outrage.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au \nLIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9\n\nFor over forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world\u2019s greatest stories.

Two months ago, a court in the United States found one of its members, Hollywood actor Danny Masterson, guilty of multiple rapes. As intolerable as that is, what the case also exposed were the extraordinary tactics the Church used to protect its star recruit, and how it cruelly attempted to silence his victims, who themselves were Scientologists.\n\nSince then, there have been even more revelations about life inside Scientology, including damning accusations of serious abuses and mob-style operations and attacks. But as Tara Brown reports, taking on an organisation as bullying and belligerent as Scientology comes at a cost.\n\n\nRead more on Yashar Ali\u0027s exclusive report on Shelly Miscavige\u0027s disappearance:\nhttps://www.thereset.news/p/exclusive-shelly-miscavige-and-the?utm_source=profile\u0026utm_medium=reader2\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au \nLIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9\n\nFor over forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world\u2019s greatest stories.

It\u2019s three years since a drugged truck driver ran down and killed four officers on Melbourne\u2019s Eastern Freeway. It was the deadliest day in the history of the force, made even more horrific by a callous Porsche driver who taunted and filmed the dying police and then shared the vision with his friends.\n\nNow, in a joint investigation with The Age, 60 MINUTES can reveal a bizarre and worrying twist in the story. As Amelia Adams reports, the semi-trailer driver, who has been convicted and jailed for his actions, might not have been behind the wheel that terrible day but for his boss\u2019s devotion to a little-known, hardline religious sect called The Potter\u2019s House.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au \nLIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9\n\nFor over forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world\u2019s greatest stories.

Another skirmish in the so-called war on terror. That is until you\u0027re in the thick of it, under enemy fire. That\u0027s when you realise how grim, how relentless, maybe how futile this war really is. Despite the jubilation after the American invasion five years ago, the Taliban has not been defeated. Far from it. This conflict is now deadlier than ever, and we\u0027re about to send 240 more Australian troops into a country where the enemy\u0027s everywhere and everyone\u0027s a target.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au \nLIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9\n\nFor forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world\u2019s greatest stories.

Not only that, but whatever those decisions, isn\u2019t it guaranteed that they will be respected and supported? Surprisingly the answer is often no. Some fundamentalist churches still actively preach that homosexuality is a sin, and they think a bizarre mix of prayer and threat is the way to fix it. As Sarah Abo reports in a special 60 MINUTES investigation, a form of gay conversion therapy continues to be practised on mainly young Australians who have been deemed \u201Cbroken\u201D by church ministers and counsellors.

It started when David Koresh, a cult leader who thought he was Jesus Christ, decided to take on the United States government. There was a violent gun battle and ten people, including four federal agents, were killed. But that bloodbath led to a bizarre standoff which lasted almost two months before Koresh, and 79 of his followers, were burned alive in a deliberately lit inferno. Only nine people survived. One of them was Australian man Graeme Craddock, and now for the first time he is telling what it was like inside Waco \u2013 and why he still believes David Koresh will one day return to Earth as the son of God.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au \nLIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9\n\nFor forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world\u2019s greatest stories.

      "description": "She\u2019s the embodiment of evil. A woman whose terrify deeds have destroyed many lives. For years, Anne Hamilton-Byrne ran a bizarre cult known as The Family. But this was no ordinary family. Children stolen at birth, brainwashed, beaten, even given mind altering drugs like LSD. The list of abuses as her isolated retreat outside Melbourne goes on. It was a true house of horrors. Throughout it all Hamilton-Byrne was helped by a group of unquestioning followers, including a sinister group of women known as \u2018The Aunties\u2019. To these disciples, she was the reincarnation as Jesus Christ. Her word, gospel. Hamilton-Byrne spent years dodging the truth about what went on inside The Family. But in 2009, for the first time, she spoke to 60 Minutes.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au \nLIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9\n\nFor forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world\u2019s greatest stories.

      "description": "In the late 1960\u0027s Charles Manson led a small, fanatical cult on a self-styled war against society. He and several female followers were convicted of at least seven murders, including actress Sharon Tate - then eight months pregnant. The world was shocked not just by the cruelty of the crimes but the robot-like behaviour of Manson\u0027s \u0027family\u0027 during their trial. For many, the only comfort was the thought that Manson would be put away for life. That\u0027s why this 1981 interview caused such a stir. Not only do we see Manson, cold and unrepentant - but we hear his thoughts on gaining parole and getting out of prison \u0027to play like a human\u0027.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au \nLIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9\n\nFor forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world\u2019s greatest stories.

She denies she was trying to \u0027escape\u0027 and claims she is penniless, despite allegations that she has some $40 million hidden in Swiss banks. Sheela says the thousands of Americans and Australians who joined the cult were virtually begging to be fleeced and Bhagwan accommodated them with all his Rolls Royces.

Manson, who lived as the embodiment of insanity, died in prison. But as Tara Brown reports, three of the other perpetrators are still alive and one, Leslie Van Houten, could walk free from jail in the next few weeks. Van Houten claims that after half a century behind bars she deserves her release because she\u2019s a reformed woman. However, that assurance holds little weight for the loved ones of the victims. Debra Tate, the younger sister of Sharon Tate, the beautiful Hollywood actress slain by the Manson family, tells Brown how she has devoted her life to ensuring her sister\u2019s killers are never released.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au \nLIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9\n\nFor forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world\u2019s greatest stories.
