      "description": "In 2011, a year after the News of the World sting on Sarah Ferguson, the then-duchess of York agreed to sit down for an interview with 60 Minutes, where nothing was off the table. Instead, Fergie became ice-cold and hostile - refusing to talk about the biggest controversy she\u0027s had to face in her life.\n\nThe News of the World sting happened at a time when Fergie was facing serious financial strife. Now, because of recently leaked emails dating back to 2011, it appears her money problems were alleviated, at least partially, by notorious sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein, as well as her ex-husband, then-Prince Andrew himself.\n\n*Seeing Red (2011)*\n\u25BA Watch the story: https://youtu.be/rjD6xvEnhzU\n\u25BA Subscribe: http://9Soci.al/chmP50wA97J \n\u25BA WATCH Full Episodes on 9NOW: https://9now.app.link/uNP4qBkmN6 \n\nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia\n\u25BA Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9 \n\u25BA TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@60minutes9\n\u25BA Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \n\nABOUT 60 Minutes Australia\n60 Minutes Australia have been telling the world\u2019s greatest stories for over 40 years.

In an interview with Tara Brown, she explained how she got entangled in the sinister web of Jeffrey Epstein, her allegations of abuse by then-Prince Andrew (which he denies), and how she finally broke free from this world.\n\n*MORE VIDEOS like this one*\n\u25BA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N61aNQYAnBY\n\u25BA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQOOxOl9l80\n\u25BA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zeylckd2t0Y\n\nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia\n\u25BA Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9 \n\u25BA TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@60minutes9\n\u25BA Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \n\nABOUT 60 Minutes Australia\n60 Minutes Australia have been telling the world\u2019s greatest stories for over 40 years.

His association with now-dead billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and accomplice  Ghislaine Maxwell was clearly beyond the pale. But even worse, blinded by his own arrogance, he thought he could lie his way out of damning accusations made by Virginia Giuffre, that she was sex trafficked to him when she was just 17. In the end, the damage Andrew was inflicting\non the monarchy was so immense, King Charles had no option but to strip his brother of all his titles and honours, including Prince. Adding to Andrew\u2019s humiliation, he\u2019s being evicted from his royal mansion. Many are demanding his next home be a prison cell.\n\n*Prince No More (2025)*\n\u25BA Subscribe: http://9Soci.al/chmP50wA97J \n\u25BA WATCH Full Episodes on 9NOW: https://9now.app.link/uNP4qBkmN6 \n\n*MORE VIDEOS like this one*\n\u25BA https://youtu.be/2j1ZcGKoJcU\n\u25BA https://youtu.be/2rr3a2Z0EsY\n\u25BA https://youtu.be/11XW7ZjzYDQ\n\nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia\n\u25BA Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9 \n\u25BA TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@60minutes9\n\u25BA Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \n\nABOUT 60 Minutes Australia\n60 Minutes Australia have been telling the world\u2019s greatest stories for over 40 years.

When she was 18, she was indecently assaulted by a married Hillsong staff member. He pleaded guilty in 2020 and received a two-year good behaviour bond, but the punishment did little to ease Anna\u2019s trauma. She wanted Hillsong to take some responsibility for its employee, so she took civil action against the church. Hillsong\u2019s response has been not very Christian.\n\n*MORE VIDEOS like this one*\n\u25BA https://youtu.be/5uHd7auGw64\n\u25BA https://youtu.be/4g2FgAu1NYw\n\u25BA https://youtu.be/qY6BAgxHEGQ\n\nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia\n\u25BA WATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au \n\u25BA Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \n\u25BA Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins \n\u25BA Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9 \n\nABOUT 60 Minutes Australia\nFor over forty years, 60 Minutes Australia have been telling Australians the world\u2019s greatest stories.

Last week he was jailed for 30 years for drugging and sexually assaulting two women in 2003. Masterson\u2019s trial attracted enormous attention, not only because of his fame and violent crimes.  The Church of Scientology was also condemned, accused of going to extraordinary lengths to protect its star recruit from prosecution.\n\nBut what\u2019s been revealed since Masterson\u2019s sentencing is causing more controversy.  The disgraced actor received substantial support from fellow Hollywood celebrities including Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis. In letters to the judge asking for leniency for Masterson, the married couple described their friend more like a saint than a sinner. They said he was a role model and an exceptional character. Not surprisingly their comments have caused outrage.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au \nLIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9\n\nFor over forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world\u2019s greatest stories.

Two months ago, a court in the United States found one of its members, Hollywood actor Danny Masterson, guilty of multiple rapes. As intolerable as that is, what the case also exposed were the extraordinary tactics the Church used to protect its star recruit, and how it cruelly attempted to silence his victims, who themselves were Scientologists.\n\nSince then, there have been even more revelations about life inside Scientology, including damning accusations of serious abuses and mob-style operations and attacks. But as Tara Brown reports, taking on an organisation as bullying and belligerent as Scientology comes at a cost.\n\n\nRead more on Yashar Ali\u0027s exclusive report on Shelly Miscavige\u0027s disappearance:\nhttps://www.thereset.news/p/exclusive-shelly-miscavige-and-the?utm_source=profile\u0026utm_medium=reader2\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au \nLIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9\n\nFor over forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world\u2019s greatest stories.

But in all his time working for the institution, he says he never once saw a person \u0027converted\u0027 to be straight \u2013 and that he spent over two decades not just deceiving LGBT church members but also himself.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au \nLIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9\n\nFor forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world\u2019s greatest stories.

      "description": "These days in Australia, and other western countries, isn\u2019t it a given that we make our own choices about our sexuality? Not only that, but whatever those decisions, isn\u2019t it guaranteed that they will be respected and supported? Surprisingly the answer is often no. Some fundamentalist churches still actively preach that homosexuality is a sin, and they think a bizarre mix of prayer and threat is the way to fix it. As Sarah Abo reports in a special 60 MINUTES investigation, a form of gay conversion therapy continues to be practised on mainly young Australians who have been deemed \u201Cbroken\u201D by church ministers and counsellors. But shamefully, far from doing God\u2019s work, these people are causing lifelong damage.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au \nLIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9\n\nFor forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world\u2019s greatest stories.

There was a violent gun battle and ten people, including four federal agents, were killed. But that bloodbath led to a bizarre standoff which lasted almost two months before Koresh, and 79 of his followers, were burned alive in a deliberately lit inferno. Only nine people survived. One of them was Australian man Graeme Craddock, and now for the first time he is telling what it was like inside Waco \u2013 and why he still believes David Koresh will one day return to Earth as the son of God.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au \nLIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9\n\nFor forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world\u2019s greatest stories.

McMullen has taken a copy of the interview to Oregon to show Bhagwan and seek his reaction.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au \nLIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9\n\nFor forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world\u2019s greatest stories.

Van Houten claims that after half a century behind bars she deserves her release because she\u2019s a reformed woman. However, that assurance holds little weight for the loved ones of the victims. Debra Tate, the younger sister of Sharon Tate, the beautiful Hollywood actress slain by the Manson family, tells Brown how she has devoted her life to ensuring her sister\u2019s killers are never released.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au \nLIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9\n\nFor forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world\u2019s greatest stories.
