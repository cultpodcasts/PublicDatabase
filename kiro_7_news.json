      "description": "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said Thursday that he did not think it was appropriate for the Justice Department to be tracking the search histories of lawmakers who are reviewing files from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.\n\nThe rare rebuke to the Trump administration came as photographs emerged revealing an apparent index of records reviewed by a Democratic member of Congress who was among the lawmakers given an opportunity to read less-redacted versions of the Epstein files at a department annex and on department-owned computers.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, asked the Justice Department\u0027s inspector general to investigate what he characterized as \u201Cspying,\u201D and Johnson, a close ally of President Donald Trump, offered his own scolding when asked about the issue Thursday.",
