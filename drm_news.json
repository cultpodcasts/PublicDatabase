      "description": "The killing of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe shocked people after the killer revealed his motives. Tetsuya Yamagami said he killed Abe because of his links to the \u2018Unification Church\u2019, popularly perceived as a \u2018cult\u2019 with massive levels of influence in Japan, historically.
