      "description": "The killing of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe shocked people after the killer revealed his motives. Tetsuya Yamagami said he killed Abe because of his links to the \u2018Unification Church\u2019, popularly perceived as a \u2018cult\u2019 with massive levels of influence in Japan, historically. Known for its mass-weddings, aggressive fundraising campaigns, and the near-messianic presence of its leader Moon, the church wields tremendous influence over its followers. What exactly is this church which has been able to amass such influence in Japan and what kind of criminal activities is it entangled in? \n\nCredits\nLead reporter: Aiza Nadeem\nVideo editing and animations: Aiza Nadeem, Abdul Muneeb\nManaging Editor: Zia ur Rehman\nChief Editor: Syeda Amna Hassan\n\nSources: \nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66704255\n https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/what-is-unification-church-how-will-japans-probe-affect-it-2022-11-22/   https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/bitstream/handle/document/62323/ssoar-socreg-2018-2-barker-The_unification_church_a_kaleidoscopic.pdf;sequence=1\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/born-into-unification-church-moonies-life-2022-7\n\nhttps://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/103399-most-couples-married-simultaneously-single-venue#:~:text=Some%2035%2C000%20couples%20officiated%20over,ceremony%20through%20a%20satellite%20link.\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/2bf8dd43-78ca-4d2f-935e-70c9d34e1a5d\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/born-into-unification-church-moonies-life-2022-7\n https://www.ft.com/content/2bf8dd43-78ca-4d2f-935e-70c9d34e1a5d\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/10/shinzo-abe-assassination-japan-unification-church-moonies/675114/\n\nhttps://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/bitstream/handle/document/62323/ssoar-socreg-2018-2-barker-The_unification_church_a_kaleidoscopic.pdf;sequence=1\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/style/wp/2018/05/21/feature/two-sons-of-rev-moon-have-split-from-his-church-and-their-followers-are-armed/\n https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66704255\n https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66704255\n\n\n\nDRM News brings comprehensive coverage of global affairs from a unique and unbiased perspective.
