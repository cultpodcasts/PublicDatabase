      "description": " Gaslighting --convincing followers to doubt their own eyes, ears, and critical faculties, and accept an alternate reality-- is essential to the cultivation process. Gaslighting is key to achieving the most devastating part of authoritarianism: the suppression of the autonomous self and any sense of self-regard and self-love. When this is accomplished, it is not hard to get people to act against their own self-interest, engaging in behaviors that harm themselves, their loved ones, and their country. Hearing crowds cheering America\u0027s low vaccination rates at the recent Conservative Political Action Conference is a good example. Authoritarian cults find favor at moments of transition, when existing political parties and politicians seem unresponsive to the needs of the moment and there is mass anxiety and anger about progress in racial, gender, and labor emancipation. This disaffection stimulates yearnings for a different kind of leader, creating a space in the political marketplace that ambitious and ruthless individuals exploit.
