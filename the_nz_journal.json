      "description": "Inside Gloriavale: New Zealand\u2019s Hidden Cult\n\nExplore the secretive world of Gloriavale Christian Community, a remote sect in New Zealand\u0027s South Island. Founded in 1969 by Neville Cooper, known as Hopeful Christian, Gloriavale presents itself as a devout Christian commune. However, investigations and testimonies from former members reveal a pattern of systemic abuse, including forced labor, sexual assault, and psychological manipulation. Despite legal actions and public scrutiny, the community\u0027s insular nature has allowed these practices to persist for decades. This video delves into the dark realities of life within Gloriavale, shedding light on the experiences of those who have escaped and the ongoing efforts to hold its leaders accountable.",
