Chris Shelton, renowned atheist and critical thinker, breaks down the importance of activating the centres of the brain, (which, thanks to Mayim Bialik, I know to be called the striatal neuro circuitry,) that are rewarded by doing the right thing at all costs, rather than the socially convenient and easy thing to which we are conditioned.",

This was conducted basically blind, without my knowing anything about her prior to this Zoom call. If there\u0027s anything more you\u0027d like to know, from Sofija or myself, please let us know in a comment.\n\nI continue to publish content like this out of contempt for the Bidadi and Ramnagara police, through whom I attempted to file an FIR against the child abuse in the Nithyananda cult. They refused, and instead, allowed Nithyananda to bribe them, through the lawyer, via Achalananda Swami. This is not acceptable in my world. We have enough witnesses and direct victims now willing to speak; Interpol, FBI, CIA and all affected world police will soon zero in on the murderer, rapist, absconded fraud who dares to call himself Nithyananda, whom I call instead Mithyananda, delusional temporary silliness, not bliss.",

Steven was there to attend a $15,000 program, which quickly left him disillusioned. Expecting guidance from the \u0022master,\u0022 it was a bait and switch, and kids from the \u0022nithyananda gurukul\u0022 were put in charge of the participants. This created the perfect scene for Steven to interact with them one on one and realize something wasn\u0027t right in their residential school. In this discussion, he shares his views about enlightenment, spirituality and what\u0027s going wrong in the world of the fraud who calls himself Nithyananda. Next time we talk, we\u0027ll get into some specifics about the exact mind control methods used during the program he attended, and how he was able to wake others up and out of their brainwashed state.\n\nThe channel Steven started to help expose the cult can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkc95HdB6XmnVW1xH9MiJ1A",

THE WESTERN LOGIC KNOWS ONLY LENGTH, BREADTH, DEPTH - THREE DIMENSIONS OF LIFE. IN HINDU TRADITION, WE KNOW MULTI-DIMENSIONS. SO, OUR LOGIC IS ALSO VERY EVOLVED TO EXPLAIN MULTIDIMENSIONAL REALITY. SANKHYA IS MULTIDIMENSIONAL LOGIC. NYAAYA IS VERTICAL TIME ZONE LOGIC. VAISHESHIKA IS HIGHER TIME ZONE, HIGHER SPACE, HIGHER DIMENSIONS LOGIC\n\n\n*ALL THESE TROLLS, THE WAY THEY PUT THE VIOLENT COMMENTS, THESE FELLOW SHOULD BE CALLED AS VIOLENT MASTURBATORS. WHEN A PERSON IS NOT ABLE TO SEXUALLY CONTROL HIMSELF, HOW THEY MASTURBATE, SOMEONE WHEN THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO CONTROL THEIR ANGER, THEY DO THIS VIOLENT VOMITING MASTURBATING. IN THEIR ANGER AND VIOLENCE, THEY DON\u2019T KNOW WHAT TO DO, THEY TYPE COMMENTS AND COLLAPSE!\n\n*THE TROLLS SHOULD KNOW, NEITHER THE CELEBRITIES THEY USE FOR SEXUAL MASTURBATION NOR VIOLENT MASTURBATION ARE GOING TO BE AFFECTED, THEY ARE GOING TO BE PART OF HISTORY. BUT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE PART OF HISTORY. YOU ARE JUST GOING TO MASTURBATE AND DIE. SO STOP THIS STUPIDITY. DO SOMETHING USEFUL FOR YOURSELF AND TO THE WORLD.\n\n\n\n*I AM READING OUT THE COSMIC SOFTWARE. A COMMON MAN CAN NEVER UNDERSTAND THE COMPUTER SOFTWARE, BUT IT WORKS, SO YOU JUST HAVE TO FOLLOW. SAME WAY, A COMMON MAN DOES NOT HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT NITHYANANDA SPEAKS, BUT IT WORKS. SO YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW, IF YOU WANT IT. YOU CANNOT SAY, \u201CI DON\u2019T KNOW HOW TO READ THE SOFTWARE, SO ALL THESE ARE LIES\u201D FOOLS!\n\n\n\n*THE GURUKUL WITHSTOOD SO MANY VARIETIES OF ATTACKS: FATHER EDWARD THOMAS, THE RACISTS CALLING US CULT, THEN MEDIA ATTACK, THEN LAWFARE TRYING TO SHUT IT DOWN THRU COURT CASES, THEN CHILD ABUSE FALSE ACCUSATION, THEN SOME GANG TRYING TO BE PART OF THE GURUKUL\u2026.

I tried telling them I had a friend there but they only let me go behind the gate.\n\n\nMy experience here -\nThe man at the gate and people behind the gate were very respectful and treated me nicely. The man behind the gate did not accept our bribe and instead called the main office, whom let me inside. This is no way a reflection or attack on their character or practice. I actually feel bad for including them in the video but also want to share my experience authentically.

He made her the head of his organization\u0027s Slovakian branch, and she oversaw many other countries as well. While with the cult, she experienced mental, emotional and physical abuse that led to total burnout. She\u0027s now vibrant and happy, and ready to speak out.\n\nIf you have been hurt by the Nithyananda Cult, you\u0027re welcome to join the Facebook group Nithyananda Cult Survivors Official.",

The blog makes some incendiary judgements about me and the role I played as the cult recruiter, but the facts they lay out about Nithyananda should not be ignored: https://www.facebook.com/NithyanandaCultOrCulture/\n\nMost importantly, please do your own research into this cult, which matches the same characteristics as Scientology and NXIVM, and please don\u0027t fall into the trap of the false master before he leads everyone into a Jonestown style worst case scenario.\n\nThank you for your time, and I\u0027m sorry for the terrible role I played in recruiting people there while under the influence of mind control.",
