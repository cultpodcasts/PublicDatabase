      "description": "In this captivating episode, Rachel Bernstein welcomes back Dan Shaw, a distinguished psychotherapist and expert in psychoanalysis specializing in narcissistic abuse and cult survivor recovery. Dan shares his transformative journey from being an actor and missionary to leaving a cultic organization in 1994 and becoming a mental health professional. His extensive training and personal experiences have made him a prominent figure in the field, earning him the prestigious Margaret Singer Award for his work on undue influence.\n\n\nThe episode delves into the intricacies of traumatic narcissism, a theory Dan introduced to the field, which he explores in his acclaimed books. Rachel and Dan discuss the chilling characteristics of narcissistic leaders, the seductive allure of their personalities, and the profound impact they have on their followers. Dan provides insights into recognizing these traits and the importance of boundaries in protecting oneself from manipulative individuals. Listeners are encouraged to reflect on the dynamics of power and control in relationships, whether in cults or personal interactions, and the significance of reclaiming one\u0027s voice and autonomy. Dan\u0027s upcoming work on traumatic narcissism theory promises to further illuminate these complex issues, offering hope and guidance to those affected by such relationships.\n\n\n\nConnect with Dan Shaw:\nWebsite: www.danielshawlcsw.com\nFacebook: Daniel Shaw LCSW (Author Page)\nListen to Dan\u0027s Previous Episodes here:\nhttps://on.soundcloud.com/1MPVg41KJQ5hya7p7\n\n\n\nConnect with Us on Social Media:\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/_indoctrination\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/indoctrinationpodcast\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/indoctrinationpodcast\n\n\n\nYour reviews and ratings on Spotify and Apple/iTunes are greatly appreciated and help the show reach a wider audience.",

Dr. Jenkinson\u2019s journey is not just professional but deeply personal, having spent seven years in a Bible-based cult in the 1970s. Her experience and extensive research culminate in her acclaimed book, \u0022Walking Free from the Trauma of Coercive Cultic and Spiritual Abuse.\u0022\n\n\n\nDr. Jenkinson\u2019s story is one of resilience and dedication. After leaving the cult, she grappled with the remnants of the cult mindset for 14 years. It wasn\u2019t until she received exit counseling and pursued a career in psychotherapy that she began to understand and heal from her experiences. This personal journey has profoundly shaped her professional approach, making her insights invaluable for anyone affected by cultic abuse.\n\n\n\nOne of the highlights of our conversation is Dr. Jenkinson\u2019s discussion about her book, \u0022Walking Free.\u0022 This workbook is a practical guide for recovery and growth, based on her doctoral research and nearly three decades of experience. It addresses the psychological impact of cultic abuse and provides tools for healing. The book is not only a resource for survivors but also for therapists who work with them.\n\n\n\nFor information about Dr. Jenkinson\u0027s work visit her website at: www.hopevalleycounselling.com\n\nFind more info about the DeCult Conference here:\nwww.decult.net\n\n\n\nConnect with Us on Social Media:\n\n-Twitter: www.twitter.com/_indoctrination\n- Facebook: www.facebook.com/indoctrinationpodcast\n- Instagram: www.instagram.com/indoctrinationpodcast\n- YouTube: www.youtube.com/rachelbernsteinlmft\n\n\n\nYour reviews and ratings on Spotify and Apple/iTunes are greatly appreciated and help the show reach a wider audience.",

She even helped launch the public reemergence of the guru behind the organization, Werner Erhard. But ultimately, Anne faced a reckoning. The organization and Erhard were corroding the message that initially sparked her passion. After years of rationalizing away red flags, the harm beneath the surface became undeniable. \n\n\n\n\nAnne now focuses on helping others navigate personal development without exploitation. Drawing from her experiences to provide guidance on recognizing manipulation, her new book Is This a Cult? Confronting the Line Between Transformation and Exploitation is an inspiring tale of rebuilding integrity in the shadow of charismatic leaders and offers hope to all who wonder whether their quest for growth has a dark side.    \n\n\n\nRachel and Anne delve into Anne\u0027s personal journey with Landmark, the emotional complexities of its abuse, and the importance of mental health support for former LGAT members. Throughout the conversation, Anne sheds light on the history of Landmark and its leader from her insider vantage point.\n        \n\n\nLearn more about Anne and her work at:\nwww.isthisacultbook.com\n\nInfo About Anne\u0027s Recovery Group Facilitated by Rachel here:\nhttps://ilumn8.life/op/lgat-recovery-group/\n\nFollow Anne on IG:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/annelpeterson/\n\n\n\n\nConnect with Us on Social Media:\n\n\n\n -Twitter: www.twitter.com/_indoctrination\n- Facebook: www.facebook.com/indoctrinationpodcast\n- Instagram: www.instagram.com/indoctrinationpodcast\n- YouTube: www.youtube.com/rachelbernsteinlmft\n\n\n\nYour reviews and ratings on Spotify and Apple/iTunes are greatly appreciated and help the show reach a wider audience.",

      "description": "Named as one of the \u0022top 10 religion newsmakers\u0022 of 2022 today\u2019s guest, Christa Brown has persisted for two decades in working to peel back the truth about clergy sex abuse and coverups in the nation\u0027s largest Protestant denomination, the Southern Baptist Convention. She was one of the first to go public with substantiated child molestation allegations against a Baptist minister, along with documentation that others knew, and she has consistently demanded reforms to make other kids and congregants safer. Christa is a retired attorney, a mom, a wife, and a grandma. And now she\u0027s the author of the new book, Baptistland: A Memoir of Abuse, Betrayal, and Transformation, which weaves together Christa\u2019s vulnerable survivor story of hope amid Southern patriarchy, religious fundamentalism, and clergy abuse. Christa bravely shares her own story of substantiated child molestation allegations against a Baptist minister, and her relentless fight for reforms to protect other children and congregants. She discusses the pervasive issue of victim blaming, the weaponization of faith against victims, and the systemic failures of religious institutions to protect their most vulnerable members. Christa also highlights the broader societal implications of these issues, including the troubling rise of Christian nationalism and the erosion of the separation between church and state. This episode is essential listening for anyone seeking to understand the complexities of clergy abuse, the dynamics of high-control religious environments, and the importance of advocacy and systemic change. Christa\u0027s story is a powerful testament to the strength and resilience required to confront deeply entrenched systems of power and abuse. Christa\u0027s book, Baptist: A Memoir of Abuse, Betrayal is available everywhere.

      "description": "This is just a preview of our Patreon exclusive Bonus episode. You can hear the full episode by becoming a member at: www.patreon.com/indoctrination In this insightful solo Bonus episode, Rachel delves into the pervasive issue of victim blaming within various contexts, including new-age thinking, large group awareness training, the self-help movement, religious organizations, and abusive relationships. She explores how these environments often manipulate individuals into believing they are responsible for their own trauma and abuse, thus perpetuating a cycle of self-blame and re-victimization. Rachel discusses the historical roots of this harmful ideology, citing examples from groups like EST (now Landmark) and Synanon, where victims were made to feel they invited their own abuse. She also touches on the troubling practices of fraudulent residential teen treatment centers and certain religious sects that use spiritual justifications to absolve abusers of responsibility. This episode is crucial for anyone seeking to understand the dynamics of abuse and the destructive nature of victim blaming. Rachel\u0027s compassionate and knowledgeable approach provides valuable insights into the ongoing process of recovery and the importance of societal change in addressing these issues.

She is a professor of English and Director of Creative Writing at Lewis \u0026 Clark College in Portland, OR. Her latest novel PARADISE UNDONE: A NOVEL OF JONESTOWN is a historical fiction of the infamous tragedy that took place in Guyana 45 years ago, it is a sensitive account of 4 people whose lives were deeply impacted by cult leader Jim Jones. The book was published on November 18th, 2023 the 45th anniversary of the Jonestown massacre, and has been received with high praise from cult experts including some of our past guests Jon Atak, and Joe Szimhart. In this compelling episode, Annie brings a unique perspective to the tragic story of Jonestown. She emphasizes the importance of focusing on the victims rather than the infamous leader, Jim Jones, and sheds light on the often-overlooked narratives of those who lived through the ordeal. Annie discusses her latest book, which took two decades to publish, and her journey to uncover the stories of Jonestown\u0027s victims. She introduces us to key figures like Marceline Baldwin Jones, Jim Jones\u0027 wife, and other protagonists who provide a broader understanding of the People\u0027s Temple and its impact on its members and the country of Guyana. Rachel and Annie delve into the complexities of cult dynamics, the role of women in the People\u0027s Temple, and the psychological manipulation employed by Jim Jones. They also explore the broader implications of such movements and the importance of remembering the humanity of those who were lost.

      "description": "Joel Looper is an adjunct professor at Baylor University and the author of the new book, Another Gospel: Christian Nationalism and the Crisis of Evangelical Identity in which he offers his fellow evangelicals a unique theological argument for resisting Christian nationalism. Using church history, Scriptural reasoning, and even analysis of Russian Christian nationalism. The book argues that another gospel, (which is actually not the gospel at all), has colonized American evangelicalism, explaining that decolonization requires a renewal of the Church\u2019s own gospel-centered political vision. Joel delves into the complexities of Christian nationalism, its impact on American evangelicalism, and the theological arguments against it. He shares insights from his book, discusses the importance of community, and reflects on the upcoming 2024 election\u0027s potential consequences for evangelical identity. Throughout the episode, Rachel and Joel explore the nuances of Christian nationalism and the importance of differentiating its various definitions. They stress the need for open dialogue and critical thinking to navigate these complex issues.

      "description": "Daniel Schricker is a composer and writer based in Adelaide, Australia. He completed undergraduate and postgraduate studies at the University of Adelaide, being awarded a PhD in 2020. In addition to his doctoral research in music composition, his academic interests include cults and fringe religious organizations. Some of his recent writings explore the theological and psychological aspects of high-control groups, leading to guest appearances on cult-themed podcasts in Australia, the UK, and South Africa. He was also a presenter at the 2023 International Cultic Studies Association Conference where he discussed some of his experiences growing up in KwaSizabantu and his role in pursuing justice for survivors of the group.\n\n\n\nDaniel provides a detailed overview of Kwasizabantu\u0027s origins in South Africa, its expansion into Europe, and the oppressive practices within the group, especially regarding their extreme views on confession and courtship. He also discusses his involvement in recent investigations and his efforts to raise awareness about the group\u0027s harmful practices.\n\n\nThe conversation shifts to the role of fear in the group\u0027s theology, the brutal treatment of children, and the psychological impact on members. Daniel explains how the group\u0027s belief system diverges from mainstream Christianity and the importance of distinguishing between healthy and unhealthy religious practices.\n\n\nRachel and Daniel also explore the influence of online figures like Lori Alexander, who promotes a hyper-patriarchal version of Christianity. Daniel shares his insights on how such online ministries can exhibit cult-like characteristics and the dangers they pose to their followers.\n\nRead Daniel\u0027s article on The Transformed Wife and more on his blog:\nhttps://revivalreviewed.wordpress.com/2024/04/09/the-cult-of-lori-alexander-the-transformed-wife/\n\n\n\nConnect with Us on Social Media:\n\n\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/_indoctrination\n\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/indoctrinationpodcast\n\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/indoctrinationpodcast\n\nYouTube: www.youtube.com/rachelbernsteinlmft\n\nYour reviews and ratings on Spotify and Apple/iTunes are greatly appreciated and help the show reach a wider audience.",

      "description": "Returning guests, Stacie Stukin and Phillip Deslippe are joining the show once again to speak about their newest investigative piece on the troublesome boarding schools of the 3HO community.\n\n\n\nStacie Stukin is an arts and culture journalist from Los Angeles. She was a contributing editor at Yoga Journal and has also written about yoga for the Los Angeles Times and Time Magazine. Over the years, she\u2019s had the opportunity to write about  Kundalini Yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan, including a majorly impactful article for Los Angeles Magazine about the sexual misconduct allegations against Yogi Bhajan and the subsequent reckoning within the 3HO community.\n\n\n\n\nPhilip Deslippe is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and holds an MA from the University of Iowa. He has written articles for several academic journals including the Journal of Yoga Studies and Tricycle magazine. Philip was himself a member of 3HO for about a decade after taking a Kundalini Yoga class at his undergraduate college in the mid-1990s. He left in 2008 and went on to conduct research into the origins of Yogi Bhajan\u0027s Kundalini Yoga that culminated in the ground-breaking 2012 article \u0022From Maharaj to Mahan Tantric\u0022 for Sikh Formations.\n\n\n\nIn this revealing conversation, Stacie \u0026 Phillip delve into the disturbing practices within the 3HO community, particularly focusing on the abusive and neglectful conditions at the boarding schools in India. Philip provides a detailed history of Yogi Bhajan\u0027s rise to power and the hierarchical structure he created, which facilitated widespread abuse and control. Stacie shares harrowing accounts from former members, highlighting the long-lasting impact of the community\u0027s toxic environment.\n\n\n\nThe discussion also covers the recent reparations program for survivors of abuse within 3HO. While the program aimed to provide settlements and institutional changes, many claimants found it re-traumatizing and inadequate.\n\n\nRead Stacie \u0026 Phillip\u0027s \u00223HO\u0027s Boarding Schools Were A Living Hell\u0022:\n\nhttps://www.baaznews.org/p/3hos-boarding-schools-abuse-yogi-bhajan\n\nFind more info on Stacie and her work here:\n\nhttps://www.staciestukin.com/\n\nFind more info on Phillip and his work here:\n\nhttps://philipdeslippe.com/\n\n\n\nConnect with Us on Social Media:\n\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/_indoctrination\n\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/indoctrinationpodcast\n\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/indoctrinationpodcast\n\nYouTube: www.youtube.com/rachelbernsteinlmft\n\nYour reviews and ratings on Spotify and Apple/iTunes are greatly appreciated and help the show reach a wider audience.",

      "description": "Ryan George spent the first 20 years of his life in a cult, attending a series of Independent Fundamental Baptist churches including one where his dad was the pastor, whose word was the ultimate authority. It wasn\u2019t until Ryan was confronted with the truth that his father was a serial sexual abuser hiding his sins behind Bible verses, that Ryan realized his faith was built on a foundation of lies. He\u2019s spent the last 25 years reevaluating what he truly believes, and miraculously, while he left the spiritually abusive IFB movement, he didn\u2019t leave behind his faith altogether.  \n\n\nIn this episode, Ryan recounts his experience of confronting his father and the complex path of untangling his personal faith from the harmful tenets of American fundamentalism and the teachings of Bill Gothard. Despite the spiritual and physical abuse he endured, Ryan managed to reconstruct his faith and find redemption. His new book, \u0022Hurt and Healed by the Church: Redemption and Reconstruction After Spiritual Abuse,\u0022 delves into these experiences and his journey toward healing.\n\n\n\nRachel and Ryan also explore the broader implications of abuse within religious settings and how it impacts families and communities. Ryan\u0027s story is a powerful reminder of the importance of speaking out and finding one\u0027s own path to healing and faith.\n\n\n\nConnect with us on Social Media:\n\nTwitter: twitter.com/_indoctrination\n\nFacebook: facebook.com/indoctrinationpodcast\n\nInstagram: instagram.com/indoctrinationpodcast\n\nYouTube: youtube.com/rachelbernsteinlmft\n\n\nYour reviews and ratings on Spotify and Apple/iTunes are greatly appreciated and help the show reach a wider audience.",

      "description": "Returning guest, Jonathon Sawyer is a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Colorado Boulder. Working with the National Education Policy Center, Jon researches public and private education. Through his in-progress dissertation, Jon explores pressing tensions between the right to religious freedom and the separation of church and state, focusing on taxpayer-supported religious schools. Motivated by life-defining experiences in a school associated with the early years of the New Apostolic Reformation, Jon is particularly attentive to LGBTQ students who are subjected to religiously motivated discrimination. Through his work, Jon aims to educate his academic community and the public on the discrimination some LGBTQ youth may experience in taxpayer-supported religious schools. He also explores how religious extremism radicalizes youth against democracy. Jon has also presented research on civil rights, education policy, and religion at the annual conference of the American Educational Research Association. Jonathan shares alarming details about how billions of taxpayer dollars are flowing into religious schools that may be radicalizing youth against democratic values. He discusses the rhetoric of demons and exorcism practices that are prevalent in some charismatic and Pentecostal Christian communities. These practices not only harm the psychological well-being of individuals but also pose a threat to the democratic fabric of our society. Rachel and Jonathan explore the concept of \u0022self-invisibility,\u0022 a term Jonathan uses to describe individuals who, due to extreme religious indoctrination, become invisible to themselves. This phenomenon can lead to a perpetuation of discrimination and harm, as those who are indoctrinated may go on to discriminate against others. The episode also touches on the broader societal implications of religious extremism. Jonathan warns against the language used by some political and religious leaders, which can often be dismissed as hyperbole but has real-world consequences. He emphasizes the need for both thoughtful liberals and conservatives to recognize and address these issues.

      "description": "Tiffany Yecke Brooks is the author of the new book Holy Ghosted: Spiritual Anxiety, Religious Trauma, and the Language of Abuse which equips readers to understand and name tactics of spiritual abuse and manipulation. Each chapter covers a different method of control found in toxic religious communities--including legalism, indoctrination, praise, and fear--and how to identify and respond to it healthily. Tiffany is the lead or contributing author on more than two dozen books, including Gaslighted by God: Reconstructing a Disillusioned Faith. A popular speaker for student groups, faith conferences, and academic lectureships, Brooks holds a Ph.D. in American and Dramatic Literature from Florida State University. In this compelling episode, Tiffany and Rachel cover a wide range of topics, from the psychological impacts of spiritual anxiety to the manipulative use of language in religious settings. Rachel and Tiffany discuss the importance of recognizing and naming abusive tactics, the role of intuition in protecting oneself, and the challenges of breaking free from high-control environments. Tiffany also emphasizes the significance of understanding the context and interpretation of religious texts, and how authoritarian leaders often use rhetorical fallacies to maintain control. This episode is a must-listen for anyone seeking to understand the complexities of spiritual abuse and the paths to healing and empowerment.

      "description": "Judith Castillo is a passionate and determined PhD student at the University of Houston, where her academic focus is on Latino and Women\u2019s studies. Her journey into academia is deeply intertwined with her personal experiences as a survivor of the La Luz Del Mundo cult. Forced into marriage at the tender age of 15 to a member of the cult\u0027s leadership, Judith faced unimaginable challenges and coercion. Despite the odds stacked against her, she found the courage to break free from the cult\u0027s grip and pursue a path of healing and empowerment. Through her academic pursuits, Judith has transformed her trauma into a source of strength and advocacy. She is committed to shedding light on the perils of patriarchal religions and the impact they have on women and marginalized communities. Her research delves into the intersection of gender, culture, and religion, aiming to create meaningful change and empower survivors. Outside of academia, Judith is an active leader in the Latino community, using her voice to advocate for social justice and support fellow survivors of cults and patriarchal systems. Her resilience and dedication inspire others to challenge oppressive norms and strive for a more inclusive and equitable society. In this gripping episode of IndoctriNation, we delve into the harrowing tale of Judith Castillo, a survivor of the La Luz del Mundo cult. A PhD student at the University of Houston, Judith\u0027s academic pursuits in Latino and women\u0027s studies are deeply rooted in her personal history of coercion and survival. At just 15, she was forced into marriage with a member of the cult\u0027s leadership, igniting a journey of immense challenges and ultimately, empowerment. Through her research, Judith courageously confronts the perils of patriarchal religions and their impact on women and marginalized communities. As she shares her story with Rachel, we uncover the dark underbelly of a church led by a so-called \u0022apostle\u0022 and the shocking tactics used to manipulate and control. From forced marriages to systemic shaming, Judith\u0027s experiences shine a light on the complex layers of abuse within the cult.

Early in his career, he was hesitant to speak about the cultic involvement of his childhood, but now after nearly 8 years of performing and producing hundreds of comedy shows he\u2019s found a way to transmute the pain of his childhood into laughter and catharsis. Uriah is now laser-focused on taking those darkest parts of his childhood and bringing them to light with his new one-man show called \u201CThree Cults Walk Into A Bar\u201D Where he brings levity to his difficult circumstances growing up in three different cults, being kidnapped as a child and recovering from a near-death experience.

In this compelling episode, Rachel has a profound conversation with Uriah, who shares his journey from being born into the Church Universal and Triumphant \u2013 where his life was dictated by the whims of a leader \u2013 to his tumultuous family dynamics and his struggle to find his own identity.

In 1998, Rachel was the whistleblower instrumental in the eventual arrest and criminal conviction of Charles Dean Miller, the son of a pastor who would become known to be a decades-long serial pedophile. After multiple generations and dozens of victims corroborated law enforcement investigations, his sexual abuse of underage girls was discovered. Liz and Rachel\u2019s forthcoming memoir tentatively titled \u201CThe King James Virgin and Other Myths of the IFB\u201D tells this story. Rachel and Liz are returning to the show to continue telling the story they began last week and offer further insights into their harrowing experiences in the hopes that they may help listeners who may have been through similar traumas. So if you have not already, please go back and listen to last week\u2019s episode where they introduce their story.

      "description": "Rachel Holdt and Elizabeth Humble are sisters who were raised in an Independent Fundamentalist Baptist Church they\u2019ve now identified as a Cult, Cornerstone Baptist Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado. In 1998, Rachel was the whistleblower instrumental in the eventual arrest and criminal conviction of Charles Dean Miller, the son of a pastor who would become known to be a decades-long serial pedophile. After law enforcement investigations were corroborated by multiple generations and dozens of victims, his sexual abuse of underage girls was discovered. Liz and Rachel\u2019s forthcoming memoir tentatively titled \u201CThe King James Virgin and Other Myths of the IFB\u201D tells this story. Rachel currently resides in Southern California, where she works as an educator in the field of biomechanics through the modalities of dance and pilates. Her extraordinary experiences growing up in an oppressively restrictive environment that harshly policed the female body, inform her teaching philosophy through a lens of empathy and inclusion of all bodies. Elizabeth currently lives in Oklahoma near her three daughters and two granddaughters, where she works as a barber, seamstress, and food truck owner. She also sits on the board of the Stillwater Downtown Association. Elizabeth attended Nazarene Bible College and later obtained a business management degree following her barber schooling at New Mexico Junior College.

In this highly informative conversation, Scott provides insights into the theological interpretations that Christian Evangacalism relies on to justify its authoritarian stances and how they are used to influence public policy in the U.S. Before You Go: Rachel explains how using the bible as the one true source of morality and justice limits a broader understanding of the world.

Her childhood in White Christian Nationalism normalized conspiracy theories like Obama \u201CBirther-ism\u201D and the Biblical apocalypse; but 2020, with COVID and Qanon, finally made her realize something was deeply wrong. Now Cynane is writing a book, \u201CTaking Off the Tinfoil Hat: How Lizard People and Space Lasers Dismantled my Christian Worldview,\u201D to process the deconstruction of her fundamentalist evangelicalism and her propagandistic patriotism. We invited Cynane back to the show to continue discussing the inseparable link between cults, conspiracy theories, and American White Christian Nationalism. In this fascinating and informative follow-up conversation, Cynane delves deeper into the insidious nature of the Christian nationalism that defined her early family life and worldview. Before You Go: Rachel explains why she believes anxiety and insecurity are at the roots of the modern Christian nationalist movements.

At this vulnerable time in her life, the ready-made group of friends in Scientology were of course there to welcome her with open arms....little did she know that she would become a dedicated Scientologist from that point on. Tammy became deeply immersed in the cult for 17 long years while they controlled every aspect of her life. In 2010, after completing 90 hours of \u201Ccounseling sessions\u0022 in an attempt to move up the ranks of Scientology, she realized the dream she had been chasing would never become a reality, and began backing away quietly. Tammy wanted to return to the show to offer further details about her complex experience with Scientology and offer more insights for others on a similar path of healing. So if you have not already, please go back and listen to last week\u2019s episode where Tammy introduces her story. In this continuation of Tammy\u0027s story, she shares details from the years of struggle it took to get her husband out of Scientology and the continued difficulties she faces as she attempts to do the same for her daughter. Before You Go: Rachel speaks about her experience supporting Tammy through the disconnection of her family, witnessing firsthand the abusive nature of Scientology.

In 2010, after completing 90 hours of \u201Ccounseling sessions\u0022 in an attempt to move up the ranks of Scientology, she realized the dream she had been chasing would never become a reality, and began backing away quietly. Tammy would try to remain under the radar as she devoured all of the information about Scientology she was previously forbidden from accessing. It was at this point that Tammy sought counseling with me and we worked together to find ways to get through to her daughter Julia and her late husband Derrick, who were both still under Scientology\u0027s spell. By 2016 Derrick was finally willing to work with Tammy to save their daughter, but sadly passed away on March 13th, 2021, and their daughter unfortunately remains in Scientology, disconnected from her entire family. Today, on the 3rd anniversary of Derrick\u0027s passing, Tammy will be sharing the first part of her story in hopes that it might help other survivors cope with their own experience and hopefully gain insights on their healing journeys. In this moving conversation, Tammy explains the circumstances surrounding her introduction to Scientology. She discusses with Rachel the lingering effects of long-term cultic involvement Before You Go: Rachel exposes the manipulation behind Scientology\u0027s teachings on \u0022reactivity\u0022 explaining how cult leaders vilify anything they see as adversarial.

      "description": "Sochil Martin is a Mexican American woman born and raised in the religious high control group La Luz del Mundo. She was groomed from a young age to be a \u0022concubine\u0022 for the leader of the organization, becoming a slave to the leadership. After escaping at 30 years old, Sochil, with the help of her husband Martin and family, began seeking justice and founded the WithYou Foundation in 2020. The foundation works to change legislation to help survivors of human trafficking in high control groups. Sochil, now 37 and happily married, is dedicated to helping others break free from similar situations through prevention, justice, and healing. In this emotional and inspiring conversation Sochil shares with Rachel how she was able to break free of the abuse her family endured for 5 generations over 100 years by La Luz Del Mundo. Together they discuss how institutions have failed to keep children and adults safe from abuse with complacency, bureaucracy, and ignorance and what Sochil is now doing to change that. Before You Go: Rachel explains how the authoritarian control of cults can often cause dissociation and confusion in its followers hindering their critical thinking abilities and preventing defection. Sochil will host a rally for survivors at the Mexican Consulate in San Diego, California this Friday, March 8th from 5-8 PM (PST) at 1549 India St, San Diego, CA 92101. There will be an open microphone for survivors, families, and activists. All supporters are encouraged to attend!

As an undercover detective for more than two decades in Arizona, Browning has been infiltrating, documenting, and disrupting White supremacy movements from the inside, gaining an intimate vantage point to the KKK, border militias, Proud Boys, and other White power groups, as they organized and grew their ranks which included police force and military veterans.   Together with his intrepid wife, Tawni, he adopted fake IDs and ideologies, seeking the arrest of hate group participants. What others dismissed as fringe groups, Browning quickly recognized as large and interconnected organizations permeating every facet of American society, effectively spreading their dangerous and repugnant rhetoric at unprecedented speeds.   Tawni Browning considers herself first and foremost a mother of five. Beyond that, she was the Supervising and Casting Producer for A\u0026E\u2019s \u201CEscaping Polygamy,\u201D a series documenting the trials and struggles of individuals attempting to leave the cult life of polygamy.   For years, Tawni has been assisting her husband in the investigations of numerous skinhead organizations. With her covert investigative tactics, Tawni was instrumental in the \u201Cshutting down\u201D of one of the world\u0027s largest and most violent skinhead organizations. Tawni continues to gather intelligence on various individuals and religious extremists throughout the world.  The series \u201CEscaping Polygamy\u201D is airing now on A\u0026E and Matt and Tawni\u2019s new book \u201C The Hate Next Door\u201C is available on Amazon and at local bookstores.  In this inspiring and important discussion, Matt and Tawni share fascinating details of their personal and professional lives dedicated to fighting hate and authoritarianism respectively.

Her childhood in White Christian Nationalism normalized conspiracy theories like Obama \u201CBirther-ism\u201D and the Biblical apocalypse; but 2020, with COVID and Qanon, finally made her realize something was deeply wrong. Now Cynane is writing a book, \u201CTaking Off the Tinfoil Hat: How Lizard People and Space Lasers Dismantled my Christian Worldview,\u201D to process the deconstruction of her fundamentalist evangelicalism and her propagandistic patriotism. Losing loved ones to the pandemic was a tragedy, but losing loved ones to the rabbit hole was its own tragedy and Cynane needed to understand the \u201Cwhy.\u201D So from the IBLP cult to Jewish space lasers, she pulled the thread, cracked her faith, and found the inseparable link between cults, conspiracy theories, and American White Christian Nationalism.

      "description": "Jon Atack is a leading expert on authoritarian cult groups as well as a best-selling author. He has worked with hundreds of former members and has lectured and written extensively in a career spanning four decades.  Jon wrote the book, \u201CScientology: The Cult of Greed\u201D as a simple introduction to the subject, while his influential book, \u201CLet\u2019s Sell These People a Piece of Blue Sky\u201D is the only comprehensive history of the bizarre group known as Scientology.   Through his popular YouTube channel and podcast, simply titled, \u201CJon Atack and Friends\u201D, he endeavors to make complex psychological ideas accessible. His scholarship has been supported by many academics from varying fields of study.  Jon\u2019s book \u201COpening Our Minds\u201D  shows how cultic behaviors are established throughout society and sheds light on the methods used in pseudo-religions, therapy and commercial cults, terrorism, gangs, grooming, hazing, and modern slavery. He also shows that these methods succeed because of failures in our education system. In his spare time, Jon hybridizes tomatoes, plays drums, and paints.    In this information-dense and engaging discussion between longtime colleagues and friends, Rachel and Jon delve deep into the hearts and minds of people trapped in high-control groups.   Throughout the conversation, they touch on both the sociological and psychological factors that drive people into destructive groups and offer insights on the healing process for those who escape.   Before You Go: Rachel explains how simply recontextualizing the language of cult leaders can help reveal the absurdity of their words, even to the most indoctrinated followers.

      "description": "Mattie Jo Coswert was a pastor\u2019s kid and proud purity ring-wearer before she moved to New York City and experienced an unexpected worldview and identity implosion. When the marriage equality act passed in 2015, Mattie Jo decided to share how the queer community was one of the catalysts for questioning everything she\u2019d been taught, in her first publicly released blog post entitled: God and the Gays. This was the start of her popular blog, God, Sex \u0026 Rich People. Before terms like \u201Cdeconstruction\u201D, \u201Cpurity culture\u201D or \u201CEx-vangelical\u201D became hashtags all over the internet, God, Sex \u0026 Rich People exposed the sometimes painful, sometimes hilarious realities of a young female Ex-evangelical navigating the diversity of the Big Apple, working for the 1%, and trying to have good sex without hating herself. Since then, Mattie Jo has developed a pilot for a series based on her blog which recently premiered at the Omaha Film Festival. Her forthcoming book is titled: \u0022God, Sex, \u0026 Rich People: A Recovering Evangelical Testimony \u0022\n\n\nIn this candid and vulnerable conversation Mattie Jo opens up to Rachel about her experiences growing up in purity culture, outlining the damaging theology of Christian Patriarchy. Throughout the discussion Mattie Jo and Rachel upack the systematic and insidious mechanisms of control inherent in the common practices of conservative ideologies.\n\n\n\nBefore You Go: Rachel explains how people leaving high control groups often miss out on the available resources and advocacy organizations in the broader community.\n\n\nYou can find more info on Mattie Jo and her work at:\nhttps://www.mattiejocowsert.com/\n\nAll of Rachel\u0027s free informational PDF documents are available here:\nwww.rachelbernsteintherapy.com/pdf.html\n\nAll of Rachel\u0027s video lectures are available for purchase here:\n\nrachelbernsteintherapy.com/videos.html\n\nTo help support the show monthly and get bonus episodes, shirts, and tote bags, please visit:\n\nwww.patreon.com/indoctrination\n\nPrefer to support the IndoctriNation show with a one-time donation?

      "description": "Eva Collins is a content creator and online business consultant with over 20 years of experience in the spiritual and personal development world and 8 years in the online business and coaching industry. She has 750 hours of yoga teacher training, along with certifications in Reiki and health coaching. Over the years, during her entrepreneurship journey, she started learning from and working for some big names in the online business industry, and during the pandemic, she slowly began to realize that she\u2019d found herself caught up in an online business cult\u2014 even though she\u2019d never met most of these people or the teacher in person.     After waking up to the manipulation, abuse, and shady practices she had seen, she quit everything. She quit her online coaching business and started working at a nursing home doing bedside care. She created the Instagram account called \u201Cwhy don\u0027t you say something\u201D to call out manipulation and empower people to speak up, sharing people\u2019s stories and experiences anonymously. One of the things that fueled her to see the truth and share it, was her previous experience in the One Taste Cult in New York City, 10 years ago. She saw through it then, spoke up about it, and helped others break free from the group, hosting them at her house when they\u2019d decided to leave. Today, Eva is passionate about helping people recover from spiritual abuse and navigate the online business world without falling for the same traps. She\u2019s on a mission to promote authenticity, honesty, and ethical practices in both the spiritual and marketing realms.    In this insightful conversation, Eva details her experience getting wrapped up in the often shady world of online coaching, throughout the discussion, she points out some of the important red flags to watch out for when encountering \u0022professionals\u0022 in this new and growing industry. Rachel points out the parallels of coaching influencers with that of cult leaders or high-control online groups and gurus.    Before You Go: Rachel explains how grounding the true helping professions can be for its practitioners and explains why you should be wary of new terminology used to imply licensure or legitimacy where it is not earned or warranted.

You can listen to the full episode by becoming a member at: https://www.patreon.com/indoctrination   In this special bonus episode, Rachel offers her thoughts on La Luz Del Mundo, the Mexican mega-church that teaches that it is the only true Christian church founded by Jesus Christ because it is led by Naas\u00F3n Joaqu\u00EDn, whom it considers the only true servant of God and Apostle of Jesus Christ in this era.    Joaqu\u00EDn, however, is now serving a 17-year prison sentence for crimes related to sexual abuse against children and is incarcerated at the California Institution for Men in Chino. In this episode, Rachel offers an inside look at the heart-wrenching destruction that the church committed against it\u0027s most vulnerable followers, from her own experience in counseling the brave young women who came forward and testified against their monstrous former leader.

You can hear the full episode by becoming a supporter at: https://www.patreon.com/indoctrination    Returning guest, Erin Burchwell is a Columbus, Ohio-based florist, designer, and illustrator. She grew up as a faculty kid on the campus of Bob Jones University, an extremely conservative Christian college known for its strict rules and controversial beliefs. In 2014, Erin interviewed with GRACE, an independent ombudsman who reviewed the University\u2019s mishandling of sexual assault reports. She and others chose to break their anonymity in the report when the school fired the GRACE team.  Erin manages her own floral business specializing in events, d\u00E9cor and commissioned murals. Some of her work was recently featured online by Architectural Digest this year. She has illustrated three children\u2019s picture books about Ohio and enjoys visiting schools and teaching students about publishing. Erin\u2019s commitments extend well beyond her business. She is a dedicated volunteer teacher and fundraiser for many organizations including nursing homes, women\u2019s prisons, after-school programs, and children\u2019s museums. She lives with her husband, Jason, her daughter Gracie, and two dogs, Fred and Mose.  In this engrossing second conversation, Erin goes into further detail about the coercion and control that the infamous Bob Jones University forces upon its students and faculty. She zeros in on the shockingly dangerous on-campus medical facility Barge Hospital, and offers up more details on the story of Bob Jones and the GRACE report on sexual abuse at the college.

He then spent the next two decades living in Children Of God communes across the world. In 1991, at the age of 36, he was finally able to escape the cult.

      "description": "Chad Harris and Lindsey Williams both grew up under the teachings of the Institute in Basic Life Principles (IBLP) cult in their Advanced Training Institute homeschool program. They were also both featured in the popular Amazon docuseries ShinyHappy People: Duggar Family Secrets. Chad left those teachings behind in his mid-twenties and went on a journey of deconstruction and learning that led him to become a vocal critic of Christian fundamentalism. He started telling his life story on TikTok in 2020. His goal is to see the IBLP shuttered once and for all, and those responsible for its harm brought to justice and accountability for their actions.    Lindsey shares stories of her upbringing and how she has worked to heal from the indoctrination and conditioning that controlled so much of her life. Because of the ongoing abuse perpetrated by IBLP and its teachings, she continues to tell her story in order to show other survivors there\u0027s a community waiting to embrace them as they leave and thrive, in what she calls \u0022real life\u0022.     She now works as a professional makeup artist and hair stylist in New York and Los Angeles, which she has done for the past 15 years. Her work has appeared in major magazines, beauty campaigns, commercials, films, music videos, and even on the red carpet. Lindsey says her career is the lifeboat that carried her away from the cult upbringing and helped bring color and joy back into her life.    Before You Go: Rachel reiterates how individual autonomy and independence threaten the control that cult leaders and manipulators seek through conformity and indoctrination.

      "description": "Erin Burchwell is a Columbus, Ohio-based florist, designer and illustrator. She grew up as a faculty kid on the campus of Bob Jones University, an extremely conservative Christian college known for its strict rules and controversial beliefs. In 2014, Erin interviewed with GRACE, an independent ombudsman who reviewed the University\u2019s mishandling of sexual assault reports. She and others chose to break their anonymity in the report when the school fired the GRACE team.  Erin manages her own floral business specializing in events, d\u00E9cor and commissioned murals. Some of her work was recently featured online by Architectural Digest this year. She has illustrated three children\u2019s picture books about Ohio and enjoys visiting schools and teaching students about publishing. Erin\u2019s commitments extend well beyond her business. She is a dedicated volunteer teacher and fundraiser for many organizations including nursing homes, women\u2019s prisons, after-school programs, and children\u2019s museums. She lives with her husband, Jason, her daughter Gracie, and two dogs, Fred and Mose. In this engaging and important conversation, Erin details her experience as a \u0022Faculty Kid\u0022 growing up on the grounds of the notorious Bob Jones University. She explains how the patriarchal and authoritarian culture of the organization was even more intense for the children of staff members. Erin goes on to share with Rachel how her own personal experiences motivated her to participate in the third-party investigation that came to be known as the GRACE report. Before You Go: Rachel explains how the unrealistic expectations and labor exploitation of the administration became easier to recognize as harmful after it was revealed that serious abuse was regularly covered up.

      "description": "Beth McNamara is a Los Angeles-based television and documentary producer with over 25 years of experience in content development and production of more than 100 hours of entertainment garnering her two Emmy Nominations. Beth co-produced the 2018 Sundance documentary feature: INVENTING TOMORROW which won multiple awards including a 2019 Peabody. Currently, Beth is the Creator and Executive Producer of the multi-season investigative podcast: MURDER AT RYAN\u2019S RUN which does a 50-year deep dive into the Philadelphia-based group known as MOVE. The indie podcast features exclusive insider sources that expose MOVE to be a destructive and deceptive cult that controlled, abused, and terrorized them. In addition to working on a book about MOVE, Beth is also developing other stories as documentary films, podcast series, television series, and movies.     In this revelatory and rare interview with journalist Beth McNamara, you\u0027ll hear Beth reveal behind-the-scenes details from her investigation into the cult dynamics of the supposed Black Liberation group MOVE. Throughout the discussion, Rachel and Beth offer their insights into the harm neglectful parents and unofficial guardians needlessly inflict on children in cultic groups. They go on to discuss how MOVE hijacked the narrative about their group and avoided any legal consequences from their child endangerment and criminal intimidation.

Stephen is now an organizational psychologist but was raised in a high-control group, leaving when he was around thirty years old, around the time when Celine was born. He has an interest in how cults operate and how people establish their sense of self after they leave, his dissertation for his Masters in Organizational Psychology explored this question. Celine is a media graduate and for obvious reasons has an interest in cults, having a particular perspective on them, as she grew up in a home where her parents worked to make a life outside the group.    In this open and revealing Father and Daughter conversation Stephen and Celine open up to Rachel about how their family\u0027s involvement with the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses affected their respective childhoods for better or worse. Throughout the discussion, Rachel and Stephen offer their professional analysis of the family dynamics involved with high-control religious groups, while Celine shares her unique perspective from being raised with tertiary involvement with the Church.

Her work with CFCtoo has been featured in outlets such as the Washington Post and Religion News Service. Abbi uses her archival expertise to track down corroborative evidence for survivors, while her theological training helps to give survivors language for the theological abuses and distortions that they\u0027ve experienced. When Abbi is not archiving Milwaukee\u0027s history or conducting CFCtoo business, she works with the A.C.N.A.too team, an advocacy group dedicated to fighting abuse in the Anglican Church in North America.    In this highly informative and important discussion, Abi shares a bit about her own experience being raised in a high-control religious group explaining how the sex abuse coverup in her church led to the founding of her advocacy group CFCtoo.

      "description": "Tia Levings grew up in a Southern Baptist megachurch, was recruited into fundamentalism by mentors following Bill Gothard\u0027s IBLP (Institute of Basic Life Principles), and eventually landed in a high control group (cult) that taught Federalist Marriage: the idea that husbands are responsible for their wives before God, and so are accountable to lead and discipline them as children. She was excommunicated and formally shunned in 2007 and narrowly escaped that violent marriage with her 4 children later that year. She started trauma therapy for CPTSD in 2008. Today she\u0027s an author \u0026 advocate who supports survivors of religious trauma and educates them on the abuses of Christian Fundamentalism. Tia believes that how the fundamentalists run their homes is how they want to run the country \u2013\u2013and that\u0027s why it\u0027s vital to understand what it\u0027s really like to live that way.    In this emotional and poignant discussion, Tia shares her powerful story of resilience and survival under the oppressive control of the IBLP\u0027s \u0022Umbrella of Authority\u0022.Throughout the conversation, Rachel and Tia unpack the patriarchal teachings of Gothard explaining how they enable and protect abusers.    Before You Go: Rachel points out the insidious nature of the IBLP idea of \u0022god\u0027s choice\u0022 with regard to spousal courtship, explaining how this manipulation can potentially lead to dangerous outcomes.

      "description": "Geoff Levin is a professional musician and former Scientologist who grew up in San Jose, CA. In 1962 at the age of 16, he started his musical life and embraced the burgeoning folk scene in the San Francisco Bay Area where he played stand-up bass with Jerry Garcia in the bluegrass group The Black Mountain Boys. In 1964 he formed the rock band PEOPLE! who were quickly signed to Capitol Records where they released the hit song \u0022I Love You\u0022. By 1968 Geoff was recruited into Scientology where he was a devout follower until 2012.   After his involvement in Scientology led to the dissolution of his band, Geoff began composing music for film and TV working with large technology companies like Apple and Microsoft. Today Geoff is a multi-faceted film composer who has scored over 50 full-length films, with an impressive range of TV credits from Game of Thrones to Parks \u0026 Recreation and many more.   His incredible story is the subject of the upcoming documentary \u0022Brothers Broken: The Power of Music, The Curse of Scientology\u0022 which spotlights the acclaimed music careers of Geoff and his brother and how their potential success was compromised by joining Scientology which also nearly destroyed their lives.    In this revealing conversation, Geoff describes the Bay Area music scene of the sixties, explaining how Scientology lurked in the darker corners of the spiritual revolution of the youth movement. He explains how his childhood feelings of isolation, created a vulnerability that led to his eventual recruitment into Scientology.     Before You Go: Rachel points out how high control groups are constantly moving the \u0022finish line\u0022 over and over knowing they can never provide the solutions or goals they promised followers at the time of recruitment.

She taught for over 44 years in a variety of settings in both mainstream and specialist teams for vulnerable young people. Sue has multiple cultic experiences from religious to corporate to interpersonal, including both parental and spousal abuse. She became involved in Fruitful Vine Ministries, an Australian charismatic group, led by a female apostle prophet. After leaving that group she unknowingly \u201Ccult hopped\u201D volunteering for a UK-based commercial hiking company which she only recently realized was employing many cult-like practices. She is now an E.S.O.L examiner and a group leader for a U.S. not-for-profit organization. Sue has a passion for language and speaks French, Spanish, German, Catalan, and Arabic.    In this complex and engaging discussion, Sue opens up to Rachel about the plethora of cultic experiences she endured throughout her lifetime. Together they draw connections between the various high-control situations she found herself in. Rahel and Sue go on to point out the commonalities of Sue\u0027s experiences, pointing out the similarity in the methods of control.

In this revealing conversation, Em shares publicly for the very first time her story of abuse, homophobia, and coercive control as a member of The Way International. She explains to Rachel how she struggled with her identity and sexuality growing up in the very unsafe, and predatory environment of the church and how that experience primed her for abusive relationships and self-harm as a teenager. Together Rachel and Em analyze the harmful dogma of the church, its fraudulent and plagiarized teachings, and the abusive culture of control, secrecy, and excommunication.

      "description": "For this week\u0027s bonus episode, Patreon supporters can access Rachel\u0027s recent video lecture from the International Cultic Studies Conference. In this lecture, Rachel explains how fear can impact the decision-making process in members of high-control groups. This subject is for anyone including those who have gotten involved in a cult, in a controlling relationship, in multi-level marketing, in a corporation that demands all your time and devotion, or in any situation where you feel it would not be safe to say \u0022No\u0022.    Manipulators are extremely good at making sure we go along with their wishes and that we agree to do what they want us to do and what they tell us to do. They get us to ignore all of our doubts and concerns and questions and even get us to a point of feeling fear about saying \u0022No\u0022 so we don\u0027t get labeled \u0022difficult\u0022 or as the troublemaker. We don\u0027t want to risk making the controller upset by putting our foot down and not immediately agreeing to something.

      "description": "Sarah Patch is a clinical counselor in Columbus, Ohio who has devoted the past few years of her career to educating herself and others on authoritarian abuse and cult involvement. Sarah cares deeply about raising awareness of the subtle and not-so-subtle signs of controlling behavior so that people can live more authentic and joyful lives. Sarah was both a participant and victim of authoritarian control while in a Christian cult where she spent most of her life. She hopes that by sharing her story, she can help individuals break down their walls of cognitive dissonance and find freedom.   Throughout this revealing conversation, Sarah shares insights from her experience under the control of Xenos, now known as Dwell Church. She goes on to discuss with Rachel her own work as a counselor, explaining how her time in a high-control religious group informed the work she does today. Together the two colleagues explain the mechanisms of control that are commonly used in cultic organizations.    Before You Go: Rachel addresses the concept of P.I.M.O. (Physically In, Mentally Out) explaining the complex stages of recovering from cultic abuse, and how they can manifest in the minds of survivors.

She can be seen in film roles that include The Watermelon Woman, Chasing Amy, American Psycho, and The L Word. Guinevere has taught screenwriting at Sarah Lawrence College, Columbia University, the University of Georgia, UCLA, and NYU. Her recently released immersive, and spell-binding memoir \u0022When The World Didn\u0027t End\u0022 tells the story of her childhood growing up with the infamous Lyman Family cult\u2014and the complicated and unexpected pain of leaving the only home she\u2019d ever known.    In this very forthright conversation, Guinevere shares her reflections on her childhood as a member of the Lyman Family cult, explaining how her isolation since birth made it difficult for her to recognize the exploitation she experienced in the moment. Together Rachel and Guinevere go on to share their thoughts on the healing process and point out how perspectives change and become more complex over time.    Before You Go: Rachel explains how manipulative leaders create a false perception of deficiency in their followers in order to keep them distracted from their empty messages of spiritual growth.

Her Ph.D. is in Applied Linguistics, and she researches how language manipulates vulnerable populations. Tamara attended Columbia University for an MFA and has been honored with residencies/fellowships in places such as Bread Loaf, Iowa Writers\u0027 Workshop, Sewanee, Ragdale, Cave Canem, VONA, and VCCA. She\u0027s published in prestigious outlets such as The New York Times, New York Magazine, Salon, The Independent, Food 52, Parents, and Thrillist.

She\u0027s traveled to nearly 80 countries, mostly alone and backpacking, and is a polyglot, having studied more than six languages. She is an empty-nesting mama to two sons in their mid-20s and a grandmamma to two feisty but adorable pups, a Boston Terrier and Australian Shepherd. When she isn\u0027t writing and reading, you\u0027ll find her road cycling, running, and playing Pickleball.    In this revealing and heartfelt conversation, Tamara opens up about being raised mostly in her father\u0027s high-control religious commune, and the confusing dichotomy of living partly with her secular and liberal mother. Throughout the discussion, Rachel offers insights on the negative impacts of burdening children with adult responsibility and sacrificing their education for the sake of religious devotion.    Before you go: Rachel explains why it\u0027s important to take note of changing or inconsistent rules in high control groups, pointing out the often illegitimate derivation of their authority.

      "description": "Pamela Jackson is a licensed clinical social worker, LCSW, and creative nonfiction writer. She specializes in therapy for adult women who have estranged or difficult relationships with their mothers. After leaving the ICOC cult, Pamela attempted to repair her relationship with her mother, one of the main reasons she was vulnerable to the love bombing and manipulation of ICOC. The mother-daughter conversations ultimately failed but also became the inspiration to her private practice, supporting women to re-parent themselves. Pamela has just completed her first memoir about the journey of mothering while unmothered, some of her client\u2019s stories, and how leaving the cult eventually led her to find a Mother within. Pamela earned a Bachelor\u0027s from The New School, a Masters\u0027s degree in Fine Arts from Sarah Lawrence College, and a Masters\u2019s degree in Social Work from Silberman School of Social Work at Hunter College. She is a co-parent to her bold, joyful daughter.   In this intimate conversation, Pamela opens up about her time as a follower of the ICOC and how it relates to her complex relationship with her mother. Pamela goes on to explain how she navigated her mothers\u0027 narcissistic tendencies and found identity as an artist despite the complicated entanglements that shaped her upbringing.

Kayla started her career in the broadcast \u0026 digital journalism industry and still uses her research and storytelling skills while creating her content. Kayla is a former personal development fan who thought the industry was the key to finding success in her life. However, Kayla experienced firsthand how the self-help and wellness industry can be full of manipulation, clever marketing, and red flags. Now she is on a mission to help expose some of the tactics that can lead well-meaning \u0022seekers\u0022 astray.   Kayla opens up to Rachel about her experience in the personal development and wellness community, explaining how her involvement with alternative forms of counseling led her to uncover a world fraught with deception and fraud. She explains how her own bad experience became the catalyst for the important and often hilarious work she does now, combining her skills in journalism and media production with her knowledge of the inner workings of this problematic industry.    Before You Go: Rachel shares from her own perspective as an LMFT, how both the unregulated as well as regulated counseling industries don\u0027t always provide the consumer protection they should and how to be aware of red flags when seeking help.

      "description": "Brian Rush McDonald grew up in southern Alabama in the early 1970s, where he eventually gave up his dream of working as a professional musician to become what at the time was called a \u0022Jesus freak\u0022. During his high school years, however, he unwittingly found himself involved in fundamentalist Christianity. Though he was troubled by his faith\u0027s teaching that the lost were damned to hell, he attended Bob Jones University where he was engulfed in the harsh doctrine and rigid views of fundamentalism. He was then ordained and began a life in the ministry, eventually having three children with his high school sweetheart. He went with his family to Taiwan where they were missionaries for seven years, immersing themselves in the culture and learning the Mandarin Language. But he continued to struggle with his faith\u0027s teachings, especially the fate of non-believers. When he returned to the U.S. he was a pastor for many years, all the while quietly wrestling with the harsh dogma of his chosen religion. He pursued graduate studies at The College of William \u0026 Mary, eventually earning a Ph.D. and gaining a deeper understanding of human development, particularly with regard to religious belief.     Finally, after 30 years of preaching, McDonald walked away from the pulpit to pursue a different path. His recent book, The Long Surrender is a riveting memoir about losing religion to find freedom. Dr. McDonald has taught at Johns Hopkins University and George Mason University as an adjunct professor of counseling and is now a psychotherapist in private practice in Alexandria, Virginia where he resides with his wife Kathy and plays trombone in several local bands,     Brian shares with Rachel insights he gained throughout his years as a devoted, but questioning Christian fundamentalist in the Southern Baptist church. He explains the uncomfortable feelings that he held throughout his time as both a minister and evangelist as he grappled with the hypocrisy of the racism and homophobia he encountered in the church culture and theology. Together Rachel and Brian unpack the similar callings of pastoral care and therapeutic counseling helping professionals share.    Before You Go: Rachel addresses the problematic nature of religious evangelizing, sharing her own personal experiences as an example of the often arrogant and presumptuous acts of those attempting to convert people.

      "description": "Rachael and Molly are the hosts of the podcast Cheers to Leaving, where they share their journey of deconstruction from evangelicalism. The podcast has been a platform for Rachael and Molly to explore their thoughts and feelings about religion and spirituality, as well as connect with others who are going through similar experiences.     Rachael is a deconstruction advocate, from Kansas City, Missouri, who was raised in a house church where she was surrounded by religious teachings her entire life. It wasn\u0027t until her 20s, while taking college classes, that she started questioning her faith, God, and the afterlife.     Molly is a trauma-informed, licensed massage therapist who was raised Southern Baptist on the mission field in Mexico City, Mexico. After returning to the United States, Molly stopped attending church and found herself slowly deconstructing. Even though she no longer identifies as a Christian or a religious person, Molly holds a profound respect for the sacred and religious. Co-hosting Cheers to Leaving has been pivotal in her healing process and she hopes her listeners are able to find community and healing through the podcast and the community it offers.     You can listen to Cheers to Leaving, including their upcoming episode with me which airs tomorrow April 20th on all podcast platforms. You can also connect with Rachael and Molly on Instagram by following @cheerstoleaving.    In this special two-part crossover episode, the hosts of the Cheers To Leaving podcast, Molly and Rachael discuss the experiences that led them to leave their Christian Fundamentalist faiths and start deconstructing the theological contradictions they noticed during their time in the church. Throughout the conversation, they discuss the need for affirmation and acceptance when questioning faith and explain how the \u0022ex-vangelical\u0022 community embraced them.    Before You Go: Rachel offers advice on how to know when a high-control relationship is not a reciprocal one and explains how generosity and a giving nature should be mutual and equal in a healthy relationship with a partner or organization.

      "description": "In recognition of the recent one-year anniversary of the tragic Russian Invasion of Ukraine on February 24th, we wanted to share with our entire audience a very special bonus episode that was previously only available to our Patreon supporters. Last year we recorded this episode with Ukrainian journalist Olga Yurkova, who we spoke with from Ukraine while the initial brutal assaults were still being felt across the now war-torn country. In this episode, Rachel also shared a few of her own reflections as someone who has a family history in Ukraine.   We hope this episode will give you the opportunity to reflect on both the devastating outcomes that can result from indoctrination, propaganda, and groupthink on such a mass level, as well as the courageous resilience of the human spirit and the awe-inspiring bravery of survivorship of those still resisting tyrannical systems of control.     Olga Yurkova is a Ukrainian journalist and co-founder of StopFake.org, an independent Ukrainian organization that trains an international cohort of fact-checkers in an effort to curb propaganda and misinformation in the media. She spoke with us last July about her work fighting Russian propaganda campaigns in Ukraine with her projects Forbidden Facts and StopFake.org. Since then Vladimir Putin\u0027s violent invasion has ravaged the Ukrainian landscape displacing millions of people and causing thousands of civilian casualties in just a few months\u0027 time. Since internet connectivity is often unstable and services such as Zoom and Skype are currently inaccessible in Ukraine, we were only able to connect with Olga via cell phone. We are so grateful for her strength and insistence on continuing to inform people in real time of Russia\u0027s dangerous disinformation campaign even in the grips of wartime chaos. Olga spoke with us two weeks ago from the relative safety of central Ukraine.

His latest project is a nine-part true crime podcast called Inside the Tribe, about a Christian fundamentalist sect called the Twelve Tribes.

      "description": "Nikieta Lambert and Asha Glenn are former members of the International Churches of Christ. Both having grown up with narcissistic mothers, they\u0027ve been gaslit, shamed, and silenced their whole lives by the people closest to them, while thriving academically and professionally, a true paradox. They\u0027re now making it their mission to speak out against psychological, emotional, and spiritual abuse in the hopes of providing a safe space for others to speak out about their own experiences and learn what it means to claim their power and autonomy.    Nikieta and Asha share with Rachel their experiences as long-time members of the International Churches of Christ. They discuss how the church misused Christian theology in order to restrict the autonomy of their members and asset control over all aspects of their lives. They go on to discuss how their shared experience of being raised by narcissistic mothers helped to prime them to be seduced by the love bombing ICOC uses as a recruitment tool and hindered their ability to recognize the abusive nature of its theology.   Before You Go: Rachel offers tips on how to recognize when a controlling parent, partner, or high-control group attempts to define who you are as a person in order to create a false narrative of dependency thereby removing one\u0027s own autonomy.

      "description": "Marissa Hackett was born in 1979 in Los Angeles, California. At the time of her birth, her parents were involved with a group called the Foundation of Human Understanding, a right-wing cult led by Roy Masters. When Marissa was 11 years old, she moved with her family to Southern Oregon, where Roy moved the headquarters of the group and opened the only school Marissa attended in her childhood, Brighton Academy. As a black family, this experience created unique challenges for Marissa as she navigated life.     Today, Marissa lives in Seattle and identifies as a fierce progressive. She\u0027s a proud auntie, sister, daughter,  niece, godmother, and friend. She shares a life with her partner and husband, Aaron. Marissa absolutely loves music and being in nature. She currently resides in Seattle, Washington where she is a grad student in Couples and Family Therapy at Antioch University.    In this emotional discussion, Marissa speaks publicly for the first time about growing up as a young black woman in a patriarchal right-wing cult in rural Oregon. She explains to Rachel the lasting impacts of her constant struggle to fit in and the difficulties in finding true community. They discuss why the current political landscape of right-wing rhetoric is so triggering for Marissa and how her time in the group actually helped to shape her own progressive politics.    Before You Go: Rachel points out the hypocrisy inherent in the restrictive rules that are often imposed on only one gender in high control religious groups.

      "description": "This is just a preview of our exclusive Patreon bonus episode. You can hear the full episode by becoming a supporter at:  www.patreon.com/indoctrination    Heidi Thompson is a freelance writer and virtual research assistant. She is the founder of Surviving Cults, a Medium publication whose mission is to end the stigma of isolation and shame by giving cult survivors a safe space to tell their stories.    She was born into the Seventh-Day Adventist apocalyptic religion. She escaped at age 19 to attend college at the University of North Texas where she completed her Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s degrees. While in graduate school, she learned about a spiritual organization called the Rudra Center for Enlightened Awareness. She began attending their sweat lodges, meditation, and shamanic psychology classes. She soon became part of the inner circle and was eventually introduced to its parent organization called the Deer Tribe Metis Medicine Society.    After her recruitment into the Deer Tribe, Heidi became actively involved in their sacred sexuality workshops called \u2018Quodoushka.\u2019 Quodouska claims to teach people that sex is\u201Cnatural, sacred, and beautiful.\u201D Heidi was told these workshops would help her heal from sexual trauma. However, while attending these workshops, she was manipulated into doing many perverse and corrupt sexual activities she did not want to do. These experiences left her deeply traumatized.    Heidi began speaking publicly about her experiences in 2022. She continues to receive messages from former Deer Tribe members about their own stories of sexual exploitation and manipulation at these Quodoushka sex workshops and other Deer Tribe events. She hopes that speaking out, it will help others avoid and walk away from destructive high-control groups.    Today, Heidi and her husband are happily expecting their first child and working to rebuild their lives. She loves hearing from people and welcomes anyone with a story to share to reach out to her on social media.

Their stories are both heavily featured in the new Hulu documentary STOLEN YOUTH: INSIDE THE CULT AT SARAH LAWRENCE     The film which is available now for streaming offers striking first-hand interviews with con man Larry Ray\u2019s victims and incorporates personal audio tapes and video recordings to tell the story of his grim 10-year influence over a group of young people. The series follows the story from the cult\u2019s origins in 2010 on the Sarah Lawrence campus until its recent demise when the last members find their own paths to survival.    In this emotionally revealing continuation of their discussion with Rachel from last week, Daniel and Rosario look back at their experiences in disbelief and continue their analysis with a newfound perspective having shaken the psychological spell they were put under by the master manipulator and sociopath that controlled their friend group. Throughout the conversation, Rachel offers her insights into the common traps that people can unknowingly fall into when they have the misfortune of encountering predatory narcissists like Larry Ray.

      "description": "In the first half of this very special two-part episode. Rachel speaks with author Daniel Barban Levin who had previously come on the show to discuss his excellent memoir SLONIM WOODS 9, about his experience getting into, surviving, and getting out of the now infamous coercive control group that began at Sarah Lawrence College. Joining Daniel this time will be Felicia Rosario who is also a survivor of the group\u0027s master manipulator Larry Ray, who thankfully is now serving a jail sentence of 60 years for his many awful abuses. Felicia who is a Harvard and Columbia Graduate was pulled into Larry\u0027s cult through her brother Santos who had briefly dated Larry\u0027s, Daughter Talia.     Both Rosario and Daniel are featured in the new Hulu documentary STOLEN YOUTH: INSIDE THE CULT AT SARAH LAWRENCE  The film\u0027s director Zachary Heinzerling had reached out to Rachel and her colleague Dan Shaw in the early stages of production to get a better sense of how to ethically portray this story from a perspective that was respectful of the survivors and not re-traumatize them in the process, they had met regularly for some time and his work can now finally be seen by the public as to provide the audience with a nuanced understanding of how anyone can get sucked into a manipulative, high control group.    The film which is available now for streaming offers striking first-hand interviews with con man Larry Ray\u2019s victims and incorporates personal audio tapes and video recordings to tell the story of his grim 10-year influence over a group of young people. The series follows the story from the cult\u2019s origins in 2010 on the Sarah Lawrence campus until its recent demise when the last members find their own paths to survival.   Throughout this cathartic and engaging conversation, Daniel and Felicia both begin to unpack the trauma of their experiences with Larry. With Rachel\u0027s encouragement, they provide insights into the new perspective they\u0027ve gained after telling their stories through the film, reassessing what happened with a new distance from the abuse they finally broke free of.   Before You Go: Rachel explains the sociopathic mindstate of people like Larry who manipulate people in the most extreme ways seemingly just as a sort of sport. Rachel goes on to point out why it can often be difficult for followers to recognize these toxic traits in leaders.   You can stream STOLEN YOUTH: INSIDE THE CULT AT SARAH LAWRENCE now on Hulu.

      "description": "CONTENT WARNING: Child Abuse \u0026 Sex Trafficking  Isami Daehn is a subject matter expert on anti-human trafficking and child safety. She grew up in Japan and was raised by professional con artists under the guise of \u201Cmissionaries.\u0022 Her home was an unsafe place for children, as her mother became her sex trafficker at the age of 9. Since leaving her abusive home as an adult, her mission has been to become a voice for the exploited and abused within religious settings and educate leadership on the subjects of anti-human trafficking and child safety. Isami has a B.S. degree in interdisciplinary studies (Graphic Design/Communications\u002BPsychology), has completed professional training in global and domestic anti-human trafficking, has an active ICF coaching certification, and has appeared on multiple shows/podcasts internationally and within the United States. Her story of resilience has allowed her to connect with thousands of survivors across the globe. She currently resides in Las Vegas, NV, with her husband.    Isami shares with Rachel the childhood traumas she endured as a sex trafficking victim at the hands of her mother and the dangerous church community of the Independent Fundamentalist Baptist movement. Throughout the conversation, Rachel outlines the common practices of isolated church communities that lack the structure and accountability measures necessary to keep their followers safe in instances of abuse. Together Isami and Rachel emphasize the difficulties survivors face when coming forward and how abusers rely on these obstacles to protect themselves from the consequences of their horrific actions, which too often go unpunished.   Before You Go: Rachel details the psychological impediments that prevent children from speaking out against their abusers and explains how abuse in isolated religious communities inherently makes it more difficult for survivors to come forward.

      "description": "Meg Appelgate is the CEO of Unsilenced, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to stop institutional child abuse by empowering self-advocates to promote lasting social change. The organization envisions a world where youth are free from institutionalization and the voices of young people are respected in the development of their own mental, emotional, and physical well-being.  At the age of 15, Meg was abducted by two strangers in the middle of the night from her California home and was told that \u201Cshe was coming with them\u201D. 8 hours later she found herself at a lockdown treatment facility in Boise, Idaho. Then, 6 months later, she found herself in an additional behavioral modification program in northern Montana where she spent the next 3 years.   After graduating college, with a degree in psychology, completely oblivious to the abuse she had experienced, Meg spent the next 17 years dedicating her life to serving on various non-profit boards to help them with board development and recruitment and expanding their programs to further their impact. It wasn\u2019t until she was well into her non-profit career that she woke up to the abuse and brainwashing that plagued her childhood and the effect it had on her entire adulthood. It was then that she became determined to pair her love of giving back and helping those in need, with her dedication to empowering other survivors of institutional abuse.   Meg brings to Unsilenced an extensive background in non-profit management, board development, and fund development. She is actively involved with and serves on the Board of Directors at Laura\u2019s House and The Shea Center. When she doesn\u2019t find herself fully immersed in new ideas for fundraising and development, Meg loves traveling to see new places with her husband and 4 children.    In this candid and revealing conversation Meg shares with Rachel the harrowing experiences of her adolescence that inspired the work she does today. Throughout the discussion, Rachel relates to Meg the insights she\u0027s gained from her years working with people who\u0027ve been negatively impacted after encountering dangerously unprofessional practitioners in the therapy field.    Before You Go: Rachel reiterates how silencing whistleblowers allows abuse to continue and exemplifies why communication is a fundamental human need by explaining the genesis of the obscure Chinese language of Nushu.

      "title": "Detecting Deception w/Steven Hassan, Ph.D.",
      "description": "Steven Hassan, Ph.D. is a mental health professional and expert in undue influence tactics used by authoritarian leaders and destructive cults. His expertise includes harmful influence in cases of destructive religious and political cults, human trafficking, extremist and terrorist groups, one-on-one relationships, families, parental alienation, mini-cults, therapy and self-improvement groups, professional and institutional abuse, corporate and multi-level marketing programs, and harmful belief systems. He is the author of four books including Combating Cult Mind Control, Freedom of Mind, and The Cult of Trump. He is a translated author with books in 10 languages. His online video courses are Understanding Cults: The Basics and Understanding Cults: A Foundational Course for Clinicians.     Dr. Hassan is the Founding Director of the Freedom of Mind Resource Center, which provides training, consulting, and support to individuals who are struggling to leave or recover from a cult and to families and organizations that are concerned about cult behaviors. He developed the BITE Model of Authoritarian Control to identify control tactics and the Influence Continuum Model to discern ethical from unethical influence. Dr. Hassan began helping people affected by undue influence after he was deprogrammed from the Moon cult in 1976 at age 22. His 45-plus years of experience give him a unique perspective on the damaging effects of undue influence and exploitation by destructive cults. He is a frequently requested speaker and media interviewee. Dr. Hassan holds a Master\u2019s Degree in Counseling Psychology from Cambridge College and a Doctorate in Organizational Development and Change from Fielding Graduate University School of Leadership Studies.    Longtime colleagues Steven and Rachel, compare notes on what they have learned from their respective careers as mental health professionals specializing in cult education and recovery. Steve explains how his academic modeling aims to help policymakers better understand undue influence in order to prevent and prosecute the criminal actions of cult leaders. Rachel relays her experiences working with survivors of high control groups and how they relate to the behavior models created by Steve as well as pioneers such as Robert Lifton, and Margaret Singer. Together Rachel and Dr. Hassan discuss the need for the mental health industry to have a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the vulnerabilities and needs of cult survivors.    Before You Go: Rachel examines Steve\u0027s idea of developing \u0022pods of trust\u0022 as a support system to protect against undue influence. She goes on to explain ways to ensure the trustworthiness of people in your circle.

      "description": "Today\u0027s guests Joyce Short and Nina Lucas represent the organization known as The Consent Awareness Network, which is fighting for sexual abuse survivors by codifying consent in our penal codes as a freely given, knowledgeable, and informed agreement.     Joyce is the founder and Chief Executive of the Consent Awareness Network, she\u0027s also an author, and a TEDx Talk Presenter. Joyce has been an expert witness and the architect of several legislative bills that can radically change how consent is dealt with by our justice system. She\u2019s been featured on Nightline, CBS News, and The New York Times, as well as being quoted in books and journals, including \u201CThe Moment\u201D by Andrea Constand. Joyce has been honored as a \u0027Woman of Distinction\u0022 by the NY State Assembly.    Nina serves as Chief of Staff and a Consent Outreach Ambassador for The Consent Awareness Network and is also a member of Never Alone Advocacy, which was founded to fight back against abuse of power in the military. As a classically trained singer, Nina\u0027s secret superpower is opera and she is dedicated to applying her robust voice to inform, educate and empower wherever she can in all efforts to codify consent.    In this highly informative and revelatory discussion, Joyce and Nina outline the messy and ineffective history of consent and sexual assault laws in the U.S. through the lens of their own personal experiences with the failures of our current justice system. They explain how legally defining consent will ultimately help create a more just outcome for survivors of sexual abuse. Throughout the conversation, Rachel points out the ways that our current laws specifically prevent cult survivors from seeking justice and accountability for their perpetrators.    Before You Go: Rachel explains the impediments to common sense consent laws, noting how ineffective they are when taking into account the body\u0027s natural inclination to freeze up in the face of traumatic situations.

      "description": "This is just a preview of our exclusive Patreon bonus episode. You can hear the full episode by becoming a supporter at:  www.patreon.com/indoctrination   In this first episode of our new Patreon exclusive tribute series, we are covering the highly knowledgeable, and often hilarious James Randi.   James Randi was a Canadian-American stage magician, author, and scientific skeptic who extensively challenged paranormal and pseudoscientific claims. He was the co-founder of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and founder of the James Randi Educational Foundation. Randi began his career as a magician under the stage name The Amazing Randi and later chose to devote most of his time to investigating paranormal, occult, and supernatural claims, which he collectively called \u0022woo-woo\u0022  He wrote about paranormal phenomena, skepticism, and the history of magic. He was a frequent guest on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, famously exposing fraudulent faith healer Peter Popoff.  Before Randi\u0027s retirement, his foundation sponsored the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge, which offered a prize of one million US dollars to eligible applicants who could demonstrate evidence of any paranormal, supernatural, or occult power or event under test conditions agreed to by both parties.   James was a kind and brilliant man, who sadly passed away in 2020 but his impact still looms large and we are excited to share some of our thoughts on him as well as some of his ideas in his own words in this episode.

      "description": "Kacey is the host and creator of The Cult Vault, an award-nominated long-form interview-based podcast focusing on the true testimonies of cult survivors. Kacey began her podcast during the COVID-19 lockdown, which coincided with her maternity leave. At first, it was intended to be focused on researching cult cases from history and presenting them to those who might be interested in listening. But as survivors began reaching out she realized her platform had turned into something more - a place for stories to be told and for Kacey and her listeners to learn about cult dynamics from those who have most closely experienced them.     In this exciting crossover episode, the two podcast hosts compare and contrast their experiences of publicly interviewing cult survivors from dozens of different groups. Kacey offers personal insights on her work, explaining the importance of embracing the learning curve inherent when diving into the world of cults head first, while Rachel details her preferred methodology in therapeutic settings for her clients as well as when conducting interventions with the families of those ensnared in dangerous high-control groups or relationships.   Before You Go: Rachel emphasizes the importance of  allyship in the cult survivor community from people not impacted personally, explaining how it strengthens the movement and creates meaningful bonds among supporters and survivors alike.

      "description": "Tracy Coenen has been investigating fraud for more than 25 years, but she didn\u2019t always want to be a forensic accountant. She went to Marquette University in Milwaukee, WI to get a criminology degree. A class on financial crime investigations reminded her how much she loved Encyclopedia Brown books as a kid. She continued her criminology degree but added accounting and economics courses so she could sit for the CPA exam. Today, Tracy is finding money in cases of corporate fraud, high-net-worth divorce, and other financial shenanigans. She\u0027s the founder of pinktruth.com which provides information-sharing about the truth of multi-level marketing companies that prey upon women. The focus is mostly on Mary Kay Cosmetics but also covers other pyramid schemes and MLMs. Tracy is also the creator of The Divorce Money Guide, which has been featured in The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, The Business Journal, and many more major media outlets.    In this unique and important conversation, Tracy explains how her personal experience as a Mary Kay consultant led her to uncover the fraudulent practices of multi-level marketing groups and brought her to a career in forensic accounting. Rachel discusses with Tracy the similarities inherent in survivors of high-control groups and personal relationships with regard to lack of transparency and manipulative financial practices, Together Rachel and Tracy offer ways for people to protect themselves from financial abuse in both relationships and business ventures.

      "description": "Ruwan Meepagala is a podcaster and coach. In his early twenties, he became involved in the matriarchal cult, known as One Taste, which was recently covered in the Netflix documentary Orgasm Inc. Ruwan describes his time with the group as one of the most formative experiences of his life, giving him a crash course in some of the darker parts of human nature. The memoir of his years in the cult, along with his other writing and podcasts can be found at:   https://ruwando.substack.com/   In this revealing and insightful discussion, Ruwan opens up to Rachel about his time in One Taste outlining the more dangerous aspects of the high-control group, while maintaining the positive aspects of empowerment and self-confidence he experienced. He goes on to share how the group\u0027s leader Nicole Daedone, who is still under investigation by the FBI conducted her \u0022orgasmic meditation\u0022 business. Throughout the conversation, Rachel points out the cognitive dissonance may cult survivors feel as they struggle to hang on to the helpful practices or ideas they learned in an otherwise destructive group.    Before You Go: Rachel expands on the seemingly counter-intuitive notion of survivors holding on to certain positive aspects learned from their time in high control groups. She offers up tools for figuring out what ideas to abandon and what lessons to remember.

      "description": "Sarah Landry is a Canadian jewelry artist who has made it her mission in life to expose the criminal activity of \u201CNithyananda,\u201D a con artist whom she once called \u201Cguru. Sarah spent nine years in a destructive cult led by the fraudulent \u0022swami\u0022 She fell into the trap of this dangerous organization in Vancouver in 2009, believing it to be a yoga and meditation academy. Once in, the group tightened control over her life to the point that she was pressured to take the vow of monasticism in 2015, at the age of 30, and only then, discovered the darkness behind the scenes. In 2018, she learned that children living in the ashram were regularly beaten, starved, sleep deprived, and verbally berated as punishment for failure to perform onstage and con people out of money through the demonstration of fake \u0022third eye powers.\u0022 It took her a year to deprogram and get the courage to speak out, but on September 11, 2019, she went public with a post on Facebook and a video on YouTube detailing the child abuse. Since then, Sarah has been the target of a massive character assassination attempt by the group she once wholeheartedly served. They have called her an agent of the Catholic church and accused her of such crimes as the attempted assassination of the cult leader, rape, war profiteering, and genocide. She is (obviously) innocent of all these trumped-up accusations, and much to the chagrin of those trying to silence her, she continues to speak out against the crimes and abuse of Nithyananda and his brainwashed followers.   Sarah returns to the show to update Rachel on the ongoing saga of a dangerous cult leader still on the run from INTERPOL and the Indian authorities, she explains what it\u0027s been like coping with the attacks on her by the cult\u0027s followers as she almost singlehandedly raises awareness of Nithyananda in the mainstream media in an effort to finally bring justice to the numerous victims of his, many of whom have been suffering in silence because of the vindictive attacks whistleblowers receive.   Before you Go: Rachel explains how cult leaders will deflect accusations by personally attacking the accusers, often by labeling them as \u0022attention seekers\u0022 in an effort to distract the public from their criminal and immoral activity.

      "description": "Lisa Guerci was raised, from the age of five, in a Connecticut-based doomsday cult known as \u0022The Work\u0022, led by a man who called himself Brother Julius and eventually God. His message was that he was a sin-demonstrating Messiah sent to bring about the end of the world. The altered reality of this small but extremely toxic group was Lisa\u0027s entire life until she escaped at age 26, with her young daughter.  In this illuminating and moving conversation, Lisa opens up to Rachel about the deep trauma she experienced from being raised by her mother, a follower of the infamous cult leader \u0022Brother Julius\u0022 She details the complex and difficult relationships with her immediate family, outlining the emotional damage and long-lasting effects of familial destruction at the hands of this manipulative and sociopathic cult leader. Together, Rachel and Lisa break down the steps she took toward recovery explaining the healing power of creativity, resilience, and storytelling.   Before You Go: Rachel expands on the notion of the \u0022sinful messiah\u0022 exposing the manipulative yet clever and effective tactic leaders use to avoid accountability from allegations of abuse.

His history of Scientology, Let\u2019s Sell These People a Piece of Blue Sky, is a best-seller. He has spoken at conferences all over the world and led the five-day Getting Clear of Scientology seminar in Toronto. Jon has been a scholar-practitioner for almost 40 years and has helped more than 600 people in their recovery. His most recent book, Opening Our Minds, exposes the similarities between authoritarian cults, multilevel marketers, pedophile groomers, terrorist radicalizers, pimps, and spousal abusers. It highlights the manipulative tricks shared by political spin doctors, advertisers, and PRs. Jon, along with his son Sam hosts the podcast  \u201CJon Atack, family and friends\u201D from his home near Nottingham, England where he resides with his two youngest boys.  In this expansive and highly informative conversation, Rachel and Jon dive deep into the various common psychological states of Scientologists using examples from the hundreds of cases they have collectively worked on personally. Throughout the discussion, Jon offers his unique insights from his vantage point as an early architect of the independent Scientology movement to one of its most important and thorough critics.

Gilpin is passionate about raising awareness and encouraging the narratives of survivors through storytelling.  In this emotional and insightful conversation, Elizabeth reveals to Rachel the shocking negligence and dangerous techniques of the abusive boarding school she attended as a teen.

      "description": "Mike Rinder was raised as a Scientologist from the age of 5 when his parents began attending the Scientology International Center in Australia in the early 1960s. He eventually went on to serve as Scientology\u2019s international spokesperson. Mike was the head of OSA- Scientology\u0027s Office of Special Affairs and was a member of the Board of directors of the Church of Scientology International. Since denouncing Scientology, Rinder has become a prominent whistleblower against its abuses. He appeared in the HBO documentary Going Clear and co-hosted all three seasons of Leah Remini\u0027s Emmy Award-winning show Scientology and the Aftermath. He and Remini also co-host the podcast Scientology: Fair Game.  His excellent new memoir,  A BILLION YEARS: My Escape From a Life in the highest Ranks of Scientology is available now.  In this revealing and fascinating conversation, longtime colleagues Rachel and Mike discuss the psychological blocks common to many cult followers as well as the specific mental hurdles former Scientologists have to overcome to regain their personal autonomy. Mike reflects on the process of writing his memoir, describing the catharsis he felt as well as the clarity it provided him as he had to imagine for the first time what his life\u0027s story looked like from an outsider\u0027s perspective.  Before You Go: Rachel explains the significance of Mike having no pictures of himself or his family from the decades he spent in Scientology, describing the damaging effects high control groups can have on their followers by diminishing familial connection and eliminating the sentimentality of memories shared with loved ones.

      "description": "Ashlen Hilliard is a cult intervention specialist helping families with loved ones in cultic or high-control groups or relationships and is the face behind People Leave Cults. She completed her MSc in the Psychology of Coercive Control in early 2022 and conducted research on the relationship between reproductive coercion, psychologically abusive environments, and the extent of group identity in a sample of those who have left cultic groups.  Ashlen has previous experience working for multiple non-profit settings in the field of cult recovery. Most recently, this has included working as Director of Events for the International Cultic Studies Association (ICSA). During that time, she facilitated workshops, webinars, and conferences for those in touch with multiple aspects of the cult phenomenon including therapists, former members, legal professionals, media representatives, academics, and others. Previous to her work with ICSA, she also worked as a case manager in Salt Lake City, Utah, for the non-profit Holding Out Help, where she was involved in the front lines of helping individuals leaving diverse polygamist communities out west.  She currently enjoys living in Portland, Oregon where she is a volunteer co-organizer of the Spiritual Abuse Forum for Education (SAFE) Meetup for those who have left or are considering leaving high-demand religious groups in the local community.  In this insightful conversation, Rachel catches up with her colleague and learns more about how her upbringing in a high-control religious environment impacts the work she does today. Together Rachel and Ashley compare notes on the emotional complexities of cult intervention and the plight of cult survivors and their families, offering up nuanced thoughts on methods for healthy recovery.  Before You Go: Rachel expands upon Ashlen\u0027s chameleon metaphor, explaining why blending in in different environments can be so beneficial for those who\u0027ve lived under coercive control.

She was born and raised in the Unification Church as a 2nd generation \u201Cblessed child\u0022. A decade after leaving and processing life outside the cult, she now speaks about the experience publicly with the hashtag #exmoonie.  Renee is also the host of \u0022Blessed Child\u0022, a podcast where people can come together and speak frankly on their vast range of experiences, within the moon cult and other systems of control. Blessed Child is a place for survivors to find community, deconstruct old belief systems, and share personal stories.  In this emotional and informative conversation, Renee offers Rachel her personal insights as a \u0022Blessed Child\u0022 born into the Unification Church. She expertly encapsulates the sprawling authoritarian power and reach of the church as well as its narcissistic and destructive leaders. Together Renee and Rachel unpack the difficulties that are all too commonly experienced by second-generation members of high-control groups. Renee explains how she grounds herself through art and family and highlights the ways she works toward healing.  Before You Go: Rachel points out the importance of integrating into a connective and safe community in order to see yourself in the truest light, beyond the prejudices of the group\u0027s dogma, and examines Renee\u0027s powerful concept of leaving a thousand times.

They are leading a campaign among others to share their stories of the horrific spiritual, physical, psychological, and sexual abuse they experienced and witnessed from Pastor Bernard Chaney. Survivors are seeking justice for the many children victimized at the church\u0027s school \u0022Voice of Believers Academy.\u0022 Bernard is under investigation but has not been charged with any crimes. Thanks to Jaye and Sonya for sharing with us their inspiring story of survivorship and their passionate fight for justice.   In this heartbreaking but important conversation, Jaye and Sonya begin to reveal their traumatic experiences of coercive control and extreme abuse perpetrated at the Believer\u0027s House Worldwide Ministries led by \u0022Pastor\u0022 Bernard Chaney. They break down their respective hardships and familial struggles as they attempted to seek faith in the church only to be deceived, abused, and taken advantage of by the congregation\u0027s sociopathic leader. Rachel offers what comfort she can by outlining the common tactics employed by sociopathic and narcissistic leaders of high control groups.  Before You Go: Rachel advises careful scrutiny of leaders who anoint themselves with lofty titles, warning that it\u0027s often simply an attempt to quell the questioning of their perceived infallible authority.

      "description": "Gerette Buglion is a co-founder of the #igotout movement and a lifelong educator, who brings discernment, compassion, and understanding to the psycho-educational journey of cult recovery. She published her book An Everyday Cult in May 2021 and is currently working on a new project called Misunderstood. Gerette has a B.A. in Elementary Education and Special Education and earned her \u0022Master\u0027s Degree\u0022 in cult awareness education from the school of life. This training occurred during her eighteen-year odyssey with Doug (fictitious name, real person) who was the leader of the \u2018Center for Transformational Learning (fictitious name real group) Gerette joins Rachel to express her passion for education and explain the events that led to her current work as a cult educator with the #igotout movement. Together Rachel and Gerette dive deep into the common difficulties cult survivors have as they leave their groups and discuss the best practices for alleviating the dizzying complexities of starting a new life outside of the high control they\u0027ve become so accustomed to. Find more info on Gerette\u0027s work here: www.gerettebuglion.com/ More info on the #igotout organization here: www.igotout.org/ Before You Go: Rachel expands on how sharing personal stories of survival does not have to include naming the group or perpetrators in order for survivors to gain autonomy and healing from the process, noting it\u0027s just as cathartic for the survivors and just as educational for others to hear.

      "description": "Heidi Thompson was born into the Seventh-Day Adventist apocalyptic religion. She escaped at age 19 to attend college at the University of North Texas where she completed her Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s degrees. While in graduate school, she learned about a spiritual organization called the Rudra Center for Enlightened Awareness. She began attending their sweat lodges, meditation, and shamanic psychology classes. She soon became part of the inner circle and was eventually introduced to its parent organization called the Deer Tribe Metis Medicine Society. After her recruitment into the Deer Tribe, Heidi became actively involved in their sacred sexuality workshops called \u2018Quodoushka.\u2019 Quodoushka claims to teach people that sex is \u201Cnatural, sacred and beautiful.\u201D Heidi was told these workshops would help her heal from sexual trauma. However, while attending these workshops, she was manipulated into doing many perverse and corrupt sexual activities she did not want to do. These experiences left her deeply traumatized. In early 2022, Heidi decided to speak out to the community about her experiences. Immediately, former participants began writing to her about their own stories of sexual exploitation and manipulation at these Quodoushka sex workshops and other Deer Tribe events. She hopes that by speaking out publicly, it will help others avoid and walk away from destructive high-control groups. Today, she is recovering and rebuilding her life with her husband.  In this revealing and courageous conversation, Heidi shares her story of religious and sexual trauma for the very first time, explaining to Rachel the generational family dysfunction that primed her for seeking healing in a faux Native American organization, which turned out to be an abusive sex cult. Heidi succinctly articulates the complex emotional turmoil of her familial relationships as well as her yearning for healthy spiritual practice.  Before You Go: Rachel cautions against ascribing meaning to the often nebulous phrases of spiritual leaders\u0027 which can actually be bereft of any true depth when closely examined with critical thinking.

We\u0027ve released over 20 episodes on Scientology and spoken to some of the most important activists working to expose this criminal organization, including Tony Ortega, Claire Headley, Tory Christman, and many more who like Rachel have all been a target of their brutal \u0022fair game\u0022 harassment policy.  In this episode, we aim to provide a concentrated look into the deeper and often more personal details we\u0027ve uncovered over the years. So, we will revisit some of those emotionally revealing and humanizing stories in an attempt to further educate the public about this \u0022church\u0022 which operates more like the mafia.",

      "description": "Sam Jahara is a UKCP Registered Psychotherapist and Tavistock certified Executive Coach with a private practice in Brighton, South-East England. She became a psychotherapist as a result of coming to terms with several aspects of her upbringing, mainly linked with cultural identity as well as being raised by parents who were involved in a cult. Sam grew up primarily in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil but moved around a lot because of her parent\u2019s involvement with their guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (later renamed Osho). From age 6 she lived in communes dotted across Europe, including the UK, and life was chaotic and unsettling. After leaving the cult in her late 20s, she spent many years trying to make sense of her profound experiences of lack of belonging and a sense of identity, stemming from being both an immigrant and an ex-cult member. As with many cults, children are usually seen as objects, a hindrance, or treated as little adults. Abuse and neglect are common through the encouragement of separation of parents and children. Now in her late 40s, she is still making sense of some of these experiences and using her training and knowledge to continue to understand cults, cult leaders, and what makes people follow them.   In this insightful conversation, the two therapists examine the impact that neglectful parents can have on the development of children through the lens of Sam\u0027s own perspective of being raised in an Osho commune as a young child. Together, Rachel and Sam go on to discuss the cultural identity issues that are often present in people who were raised in cults and how it relates also to those who had unstable living conditions as children. Sam offers a thoughtful analysis of her parents\u0027 motives in joining Osho\u0027s cultic community and opens up about the emotional complexities inherent in her relationships with her family today.  Before You Go: Rachel further examines her concept of a spiritual placebo, explaining it can decieve followers into sacrificing the power of their own autonomy and makes them vulnerable to dependence on a guru figure.

      "description": "Andrew Jasko is a Princeton Seminary-educated former minister, who has a Master\u0027s Degree in Divinity, and in Counseling Psychology. Andrew had to leave his religious faith and community because of the severe psychological trauma he experienced. After spending years healing his trauma and helping hundreds of people transform their lives, he founded his organization Life After Dogma to continue his expertise in healing religious trauma, where Andrew\u2019s clients hire him to assist them in healing and finding a healthy, authentic spiritual or secular connection that suits them.   Andrew shares his theological knowledge with Rachel helping her to understand the biblical origin of Christo-fascism and how it connects to today\u0027s right-wing-leaning Christianity. Together they discuss the nuances of counseling people suffering from religious trauma and the difficulties in finding healthier forms of spiritual connection.  Before You Go: Rachel explains why people who put their faith in the teachings of holy books should examine the interpretations they are given especially when they are presented as infallible or when the group preaches religious superiority.

      "description": "Esther Friedman is a licensed mental health counselor, expressive art therapist, songwriter, performer, author, and ex-cult member. In 2006, a cult took advantage of her uncertainty, open-mindedness \u0026 open-heartedness. It perpetrated what she now calls Cultic Identity Theft. In 2011, she left and found her voice by embracing, honoring, and protecting those core traits. She says that telling her story through writing saved her sanity. Those vulnerabilities are now her strengths.  Esther shares her journey of involvement in a secretive group that she knew simply as \u0022School\u0022 but which has been known by many names, most popularly Odyssey Study Group. She explains how a seemingly innocuous and coincidental meeting in a grocery store was actually a premeditated plan of recruitment by this high-control and deceptive group. Along the way Esther and Rachel exchange insights, they\u0027ve gained from treating clients who have recently left high control groups.  Before You Go: Rachel explains how ex-members of high control groups have a right to feel anger and how that intensity can be used as a positive motivator toward healing and self-reliance.

      "description": "Rachel Manija Brown\u0027s parents moved her to an ashram in India when she was seven years old to worship the guru Meher Baba. Rachel stayed there until she was twelve, but never considered herself a follower of him. She wrote a memoir about the experience, All the Fishes Come Home to Roost. Her mother still lives at the ashram. Rachel has an MA in clinical psychology, worked as a trauma therapist (AMFT), and currently works as a life coach. She also writes professionally under her own name, Lia Silver, and as one of a group of writers who share the pen name, Zoe Chant.   Rachel Brown joins Ms. Bernstein to share the traumas of her childhood in India in hopes that it might offer solace and hope to others who relate to her experiences. Together the two Rachels unpack the complex emotional journey of Ms. Brown\u0027s formative years and the difficulties that followed, the two therapists then broaden the conversation, comparing their treatment techniques for those suffering from complex post-traumatic stress.  Before You Go: Rachel expands on the concept of toxic positivity that Ms. Brown described from her time in the ashram, outlining the common cliches and pointing out its inherent dangers.

      "title": "Escaping Xenos w/Emma Buchbinder",
      "description": "Emma Buchbinder was raised in the high-control religious group Xenos Christian Fellowship, based in Columbus, Ohio. In 2020, Xenos changed its name to Dwell Community Church following years of negative press, and accusations of abuse and cult activity. Emma entered into leadership roles at Xenos/Dwell at age 16 and simultaneously moved into one of the communal-style housing arrangements called a \u201Cministry house\u201D, in which she remained for 10 years until she left. Emma both experienced and implemented various forms of behavioral, emotional, and spiritual abuse. Since leaving Xenos/Dwell at the end of 2020, Emma has experienced immense difficulty transitioning into the real world for the first time as she learns to navigate the complexities of developing healthy friendships, setting boundaries, listening to her intuition, and valuing rest. She is also still navigating how to interact with loved ones still involved in Xenos/Dwell. Emma hopes that her story will give others the courage to share their own experiences and create awareness that these forms of abuse can and do happen to your friends, family, coworkers, and neighbors.  Emma joins Rachel to share the emotional turmoil she experienced throughout her life as a member of Xenos Christian Fellowship, and explains the fear and isolation of leaving behind the family and support systems she had known her whole life. Throughout the conversation, Rachel offers insights from her experience in working with people leaving high control religious organizations providing context for the confusing feelings and difficult decisions Emma reckoned with as she left the controversial and damaging group behind.  Before You Go: Rachel points out how high control groups often test the faith of their followers by pushing them to do things that go against their own conscience and explains the feelings of moral superiority that often accompany insular religious groups.

She currently utilizes DBT work with adolescents, as well as being a Certified Animal Assisted Therapy Professional. At age 14, Julianne was sent away for a year to two Troubled Teen Industry programs, the experiences which inspired her to become a therapist for teens and use her work to fight against this damaging and dangerous industry   Julianne joins Rachel to discuss her harrowing experience as a teenager at two different teen treatment facilities where she suffered neglect and abuse that caused her trauma for many years to come. Julianne explains to Rachel how finally seeing a legitimate therapist inspired her to pursue the profession herself, pointing out how her time in grips of the troubled teen industry informs the way she works with teens in her own practice.

      "description": "Andrew Pledger is a religious trauma survivor who was raised in fundamentalist Christianity. He has been homeschooled his entire life for the purpose of indoctrination. His parents would only pay for a Christian university, and he chose Bob Jones University. Andrew kept his sexuality a secret until his mental health declined due to repressing emotions, sexuality, and religious trauma. For his last year of college, he created a photo series that depicted religious trauma. To bring awareness to religious trauma; he appeared on Josh Harris\u2019s IGTV show to talk about his photo series. Bob Jones was made aware of the video, and he was expelled the last semester of his college career. These experiences have inspired him to pursue psychology to help religious trauma survivors. He is now on a mission of using social media to share his story and bring awareness to religious trauma.  ----------------------Content Warning: Discussion of Suicidal Ideation---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  In this intimate and revealing conversation Andrew shares with Rachel his journey of leaving Christian fundamentalism explaining how the deeply embedded religious trauma caused undue suffering and eventually forced him to leave the church. Throughout the discussion, Rachel provides insights from a psychological perspective pointing out experiences commonly shared by recent survivors of religious trauma and coercive control.   Before You Go: In this unique outro segment, Rachel is once again joined by Andrew who shares some life updates and explains how the recent Supreme Court rulings have soured his recent escape from Christian fundamentalist control.

Troy, a 21-year-old member of the Assemblies of God (AOG), the precursor to the Hillsong church was drawn in by Revival Centres International, Now known as the Revival Centres Church. Troy was on the path to becoming a minister before \u201Cyears of questions, inconsistencies and manipulation\u201D overwhelmed him and caused an emotional breakdown leading to him abandon his faith. Brian became involved with the Christian City Churches denomination, today known as C3 Church Global, which you can hear about from our previous guest Emily, before being recruited by the Assemblies of God. He described his time as exhibiting \u201Ccultish type behaviour\u201D Brian and Troy\u0027s Podcast \u0022I Was A Teenage Fundamentalist\u0022 takes an honest \u0026 irreverent look at one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing religious movements and has been causing a stir among its church leaders.  Brian and Troy provide Rachel with some background on the history of the Australian Pentecostal movement and explain their respective reasons for becoming involved. They examine the controlling techniques these churches have employed to amass huge followings throughout the world.  Rachel helps Brian and Troy unpack the emotional toll followers endure under the controlling hierarchy of the church\u0027s leadership and the existential anxiety that is the result of its unhealthy ideology. Both Brian and Troy describe their breaking points with Christianity and offer advice to those leaving high control groups.   Before You Go: Rachel reiterates the point Brian made about pre-planning for support when leaving a high control group. She explains the appeal of absolutes and the lure of leaving behind existential angst for a group\u0027s perfect formula for happiness.

Her latest book Sins of My Father: A Daughter, a Cult, a Wild Unravelling is her attempt to unravel the mysteries of a father who believed himself to be beyond reproach.  When Lily was just six years old, her father left the family home to follow his guru to India, with the promise of enlightenment in the cult of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, the infamous leader who was recently covered in the popular documentary Wild Wild Country.     She shares with Rachel insights from writing her recent memoir sharing memories from the long, hot summers of her teenage years in Italy in her father\u0027s commune to suffering the effects of his addiction to alcohol and prescription drugs. Rachel helps Lily unpack the complex relationship dynamics with her father and offers her insights on the familial complications inherent in so many families involved in high control groups.

She is a recipient of the Presidential Volunteer Service Medal. Daniella lives with her husband and daughter in Maryland and is a candidate for a Master\u2019s degree in Industrial and Organizational Psychology from Harvard Extension School.

Daniella shares with Rachel some insights behind the stories in her book Uncultured, more than a memoir about an exceptional upbringing, but about a woman who, no matter the lack of tools given to her, is determined to overcome. Throughout her story, Daniella draws parallels between her life as a child in the Children of God commune and her time as an adult in the U.S. military. Pointing out the stunning similarities in rape culture in both organizations. She goes on to explain the dangerous deification of the U.S. Army, and the cult-like devotion and martyrdom expected of its soldiers    Before you Go: Rachel reflects on her experiences with Children of God survivors over the years, explaining the difficulties of \u0022learning life as a second language\u0022 for those who have left the high control groups they were born into.

      "description": "Sat Pavan Kaur was born into the 3HO community and Sikh Religion. She spent her childhood moving around to various 3HO communities. At the age of 8, she was sent to India with 120 other children to go to boarding school leaving her family back in the US. At 16, she would be taken out of school and join YBs personal staff.  In the last couple of years, she has left the Cult but stayed within the greater Sikh community. She is one of the many women that was abused by Yogi Bhajan. She has had to unravel her life, the good, the bad, and the horror that she experienced growing up in the 3HO community; the abuse she was subjected to, the toll it took on her and her husband, and the clear choices she made to raise her children differently from how she was raised.  She has been teaching and performing dance for the last 30 years to people of all ages and backgrounds. She is passionate about teaching and inspiring creativity, confidence, and individuality in her students, especially the younger generation which has been a hugely positive outlet for her.  Satpavan is also a musician who plays Kirtan and has played Sikh religious music since she was a young girl and continues to do so. Her music, along with dance has kept her going by providing a sense of healing throughout her life.  She lives with her two children and husband of 27 years, raising her family and working hard to be a good person and do good in the world around her. Sat is also featured in the Vice documentary The Dark Empire of Yogi Bhajan which is available now.  In this second conversation with Rachel, Satpavan fills in some of the missing parts of the story she shared with us last week. She dives deep into the corruption but also incredible successes of the many businesses that members of the 3HO community built, explaining how YB would enrich himself while his devotees struggle to survive. Rachel shares her insights on why followers have remained devoted to YB even after his death while Satpavan explains why she still has empathy for those who continue to defend him.  Before You Go: Rachel discusses how cult leaders and abusers are often not bounded by logic and explains why their victims can sometimes suffer in silence for so long.  For more information on Sikhism, Sat Pavan recommends these healthy organizations run by good people whose voices represent the Sikh community:  Khalsa Aid, Sikh Coalition, Sikh Legal Defense Fund, Valerie Kaur, Art by Ruby, Ramblings of a Sikh, Khalra Mission  You can see the documentary The Dark Empire of Yogi Bhajan | True Believers here: www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfr5jKauwtE  Thanks to all of our newest Patreon supporters:  Amrit K Khalsa, Natalie Zett, Maria Campbell, Mo Hellbender, Ruth Crossman, Ms.Kyle, Kerry Ose, and Amy Tiemann!!

Sat expertly points out the key moments of indoctrination, suffering, and, red flags she experienced throughout her decades involved with 3HO and it\u0027s monstrous guru.  Throughout her story, Rachel offers insights from a psychological perspective to help explain the cult dynamics at play in her experiences and together they look forward to the healing that is to come in the future.

Together Rachel and Dan break down the defensiveness of the mindfulness communities, pointing out the common reactions people have when their faith is questioned. Dan explains how he has restructured his mindfulness teachings with the more complete knowledge he has of the dangers of intense practice.

You can hear the show in its entirety by becoming a member at:  www.patreon.com/indoctrination    Thomas grew up in Denmark with a covert narcissist mother who kept him socially isolated, emotionally abused him, and manipulated his sense of reality. For most of his life, he didn\u2019t realize that anything was wrong, because of the covert nature of the emotional abuse, control, and gaslighting he was exposed to. About a year and a half ago he started to get a better grasp of his own reality and slowly began to understand what had really happened.   Thomas returns to the show for a third time to respond to listener feedback from his previous episodes and update us on how his healing has progressed. He details how he\u0027s been able to unpack the complex trauma he experienced growing up with a covert narcissist as a mother. He navigates this difficult path in a systematic way in order to get clarity himself as well as help others better recognize signs of covert abuse and control.",

Her clinical neuroscience research investigates the effects of contemplative practices on the brain and body in the treatment of mood disorders, trauma, and other emotional disturbances. She is especially interested in practice-specific effects, individual differences, and moderators of treatment outcomes.  She is probably best known for her research on adverse effects, and for creating best practices around harms monitoring and reporting. As a clinician, she has been trained as an instructor in Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), and the Somatic Experiencing (SE) approach to trauma. She now specializes in helping meditators who are experiencing meditation-related difficulties and providing meditation safety training to providers and organizations.  In this second half of their two-part conversation, Dr. Britton provides more details about the resistance she came up against in the science and meditation communities after publishing data that contradicted their narratives of meditation as an infallibly positive pursuit. Rachel provides insight into the reactive nature of those who are unable to recognize any imperfection in the spiritual practices they pursue and the cult-like devotion that follows.   Before You Go: Rachel expands on Dr. Britton\u0027s idea of \u0022positive affect requirement\u0022 in group settings explaining why there\u0027s often more behind the smiles of devoted followers.

The dialogue is then opened up to examine the iceberg that is Baptise Yoga pointing out the many common red flags all three women have noticed in retrospect. Rachel offers her insights into the healing process that these brave women have begun.

      "description": "Kelly Thiel is a highly sought-after speaker and consultant to families and organizations regarding high-demand groups, cults, and narcissistic personalities. She is dedicated to helping people reclaim their freedom and begin their own healing journeys.    Kelly has experience as a member of the Executive Success Program/NXIVM, a high-demand group whose leader was convicted of federal crimes, including sex trafficking. Kelly was also featured with Rachel in the STARZ  documentary Seduced: Inside The NXIVM Cult. Her involvement with NXIVM led her to study other high-demand groups and cults of personality like Bhagwan Shri Rajneesh (Osho) and Bikram Choudhury.        Her lifelong journey and personal experience as a seeker of human potential and spirituality taught her to identify the many methods used by high-demand groups, cults of personality, and narcissists to attract, indoctrinate, and control their followers and people in their circle of influence. She understands how to identify the red flags, suggest a course of action, and recommend professional resources for interventions to help affected families and organizations.    Kelly is set to release her first book this year, \u201CUnapologetically Glorious\u201D, inspiring others to be their own guru and to take  ownership, take action and take back control.     In this intimate and bravely vulnerable conversation, Kelly shares invaluable insight into her time in NXIVM. She outlines the dangerous and traumatic \u0022Exploration of Meaning\u0022sessions she witnessed and experienced herself as a member of the \u0022Executive Success Program\u0022 Throughout the conversation Rachel gives Kelly the opportunity to reexamine her impressions of the NXIVM community in retrospect. Kelly explains the relationship dynamics she had with the leaders, some of whom are now serving prison time for their roles in the group. Finally, Kelly explains the gradual shift away from the group and the catalyst that ultimately led to her freedom.    Before You Go: Rachel addresses some of the red flags that are heavily pronounced in the inflated egos of narcissistic leaders like Keith Ranerie, reflecting on the epic hypocrisy of their demand for accountability.

      "description": "India Oxenberg is a successful film producer, writer, and actress. India is a national ambassador for RAINN (Rape, Abuse \u0026 Incest National Network), the nation\u0027s largest anti-sexual violence organization. She is also the daughter of our previous guest Catherine Oxenberg who Rachel worked with while India was involved in NXIVM, the infamous multi-level marketing company that was later exposed as a sex cult.   While in NXIVM, India was introduced to the cult\u0027s inner circle and was groomed to be a sexual partner of NXIVM\u0027s founder and leader, Keith Raniere. In 2020, she published the book Still Learning: A Memoir. She produced and starred in the documentary series Seduced: Inside the NXIVM Cult, in which Rachel is also featured documenting her work with the Oxenbergs as India transitioned out of NXIVM.   In this second part of Rachel and India\u0027s intimate two-part episode, India reveals her thoughts about the complex and troubling dynamics of her relationship with Allison Mack, one of the people she describes as her main abusers in NXIVM who was recently sentenced to prison for her role in the group. Throughout the conversation, Rachel helps India to deconstruct her experiences, as she shares deep insights into her indoctrination and ongoing healing.   Before You Go: Rachel details the slippery and deceptive path that leads to indoctrination, pointing out how disassociating from your identity helps to lower your defense mechanisms and clouds critical thinking.

In the first half of Rachel and India\u0027s very personal and intimate two-part episode, they re-examine the intense time they shared together in therapy as India made her way out of the grips of the infamous and now imprisoned cult leader Keith Raniere. India opens up to Rachel about what her inner-life has felt like as she begins to leave behind the conditioning and indoctrination that left her scarred emotionally and physically from her time in NXIVM. Throughout the conversation, Rachel guides India through the revelations she had while becoming the person she truly is, rather than who she was told to be.

      "description": "Jitarth Jadeja is a former QAnon follower and current moderator of a Reddit group with over 200K followers called QAnon Casualties. Residing in Sydney, Australia, Jitarth has been covered in many major news publications in the U.S. and beyond, providing important insight into the perplexing world of Q. Since leaving Qanon behind, Jitarth has become an invaluable resource not only to high-profile journalists but also to families who have lost loved ones to Qanon. As you\u0027ll hear, his charming vulnerability and quick wit have helped him to shine a light on the shadows of Qanon and the conspiratorial right.  Jitarth shares with Rachel why he first became consumed with Qanon, explaining the ways in which it affected his familial relationships, specifically with his father who became a Q believer as well. Rachel discusses her experience dealing with the fallout of the Qanon movement. Together they talk through the consequences of Qanon\u0027s dangerous disinformation, lamenting the human cost of its voracious growth.  Before You Go: Rachel explains the often innocuous reasons and even positive attributes that can cause people to seek community in cultic situations. Additionally, she offers insight on engaging with people whose natural desire for acceptance and status prevents them from thinking critically.

      "description": "Jon Sawyer was raised in two homes influenced by both high-demand religion and secular worldviews. Prior to his parent\u0027s divorce at the age of four, his family was involved with both Transcendental Meditation (TM) and Christian Science. Shortly after his parent\u0027s divorce, his mother took a secular route, while his father converted to Pentecostal and charismatic Christianity. While Jon\u0027s father sprinkled elements of TM and Christian Science into his childhood, his dad\u0027s newfound evangelical Christian faith fixated on the end of the world, divine healing, speaking in tongues, and the \u0022prosperity gospel.\u0022 When Jon was fifteen, he converted to Mormonism. From the age of fifteen to thirty-five, Jon was involved with various high-demand religious groups that were associated with both charismatic Christianity and Mormonism. As a teen who was deeply conflicted about his attraction to the same sex, Jon attended the now-defunct Spirit Life Bible College (SLBC)-associated with Roberts Liardon Ministries-in Orange County, CA. While at SLBC, Jon experienced multiple sessions of exorcism and conversion therapies that were aimed at \u0022healing\u0022 his sexual identity. When Jon was twenty-six, he became involved with Sovereign Grace Churches: a group that began during the charismatic Jesus Movement of the 1970s and eventually adopted a neo-Calvinist theology that emphasized strict gender roles and courtship practices. Jon separated from organized religion six years ago, at the age of 35. Since that time, Jon has benefited from somatic therapy, completed both a BA and MA in education, and is currently a doctoral student and researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder. Partly due to the influence of his experiences with high-demand religious groups, Jon now studies the intersection of education policy and anti-discrimination law.   In this second half of Jon\u0027s two-part conversation with Rachel, he shares some of his most traumatic religious experiences going through exorcisms and \u0022conversion therapy\u0022 at Spirit Life Bible College. Rachel provides further background on \u0022conversion therapy\u0022 outlining its dangerous and often hypocritical roots. Together Jon and Rachel unpack the damaging culture of homophobia in the church and offer hope for recovery to those who have been traumatized.   Before You Go: Rachel breaks down the unnerving hubris of religious groups who aim to change the sexual or gender identity of others by forcing them to conform to their own rigid and intolerant beliefs.

Jon explains how his varied and controlling religious upbringing caused him to internalize homophobia as he examined his own sexuality and place on the LGBTQ spectrum.

      "title": "Abuse with a Smile w/ Emily",
      "description": "Emily is a former member of C3 NYC where she endured three years of pastoral abuse. Her account @C3ChurchWatch on Instagram was created in June 2020 as an effort to stop the harassment she was experiencing. She did not think anyone but her pastor would notice it, but soon found herself with plenty of followers and supporters privately and publicly citing harm or abuse from C3 churches all over the world. Her church and the Philadelphia location responded by conducting a smear campaign, telling members to block the account, hunting down account supporters, and sending Emily a false legal threat that was rescinded when a journalist became involved.   Following along with a larger movement, and with a prior background in cult recovery, Emily quickly saw the need for those exiting toxic evangelical spaces to understand what happened to them and where to go to safely process their experience. She operates her account today to document her own journey, gathers articles and investigations involving C3, holds space for those wanting to share their story publicly or privately, shares resources, helps people find appropriate therapy, and speaks with family/friends of current members.    Emily provides some background on C3 Church Global, a charismatic movement founded in Sydney, Australia, with a community of over 500 churches worldwide. In addition to her insights on the mega-church culture in general, she shares her personal experience of pastoral abuse in the Philadelphia location of C3. Rachel and Emily discuss the red flags she noticed along the way as well as the self-doubt that prevented her from having the clarity of mind to see the group for what it really was. Emily shares with Rachel how she ultimately extricated herself from the church and came to victim advocacy work through her IG account.   Before You Go: Rachel explains the importance of exploring the biases that may prevent you from noticing warning signs of high control groups. She points out how the optics of certain situations can be a distractionary element that clouds your perspective.

      "description": "Mark Potok is an internationally renowned expert on the American radical right, who, for 20 years helped lead the legendary Southern Poverty Law Center in exposing hate groups, right-wing terrorism, and the rapidly increasing infiltration of extremist ideas into the political mainstream. In that role, Potok faced numerous death threats from white supremacists and constant vilification by leaders of the far-right media \u2014 a remarkable measure of just how effective his work was. Potok has been described in one book on social justice activists as having \u201Ca reputation as the preeminent editorial commentator who follows the American radical right.\u201D In 2018, a year after leaving SPLC, he joined the Centre for Analysis of the Radical Right as a Senior Fellow. As the director of the SPLC\u2019s Intelligence Project and, later, Senior Fellow at the SPLC and Editor in Chief of its award-winning Intelligence Report investigative magazine, Potok was a key spokesman for the SPLC, a civil rights organization based in Alabama. He has testified before the U.S. Senate, the United Nations High Commission on Human Rights, the Helsinki Commission, and in other key venues.   In this second half of Rachel\u0027s conversation with Mark, he shares more of his perspective on the past, present, and future of the radical right, delving into his decades of experience with the Southern Poverty Law Center. Rachel and Mark exchange their ideas about how and why people are drawn to extremist groups and explore the commonalities behind a variety of far-right hate groups. Together they discuss the possible steps of action both individually and societally that may help to quell the increase in political violence and hate crimes.  Before You Go: Rachel explores the idea of hereditary hate, explaining how the impressionable nature of children makes them uniquely susceptible to indoctrination into hateful ideology.

In addition to hosting political reading groups and building relationships with neighborhood groups for CARP, his creative pursuits include poetry, comedy, and ASMR videos. Jacob joined Rachel not to denounce or advocate for any broad political ideology but to warn potential recruits to the specific group he was involved with (PSL) by sharing his own personal experience.  In this second part of Rachel\u0027s two-part conversation with Jacob, he shares the experience that led him to see clearly the group\u0027s manipulative and cult-like tactics of control. Jacob details how the PSL\u0027s national leadership conspired to cover up the sexual assault of his friend by an influential member of the organization. Throughout Jacob\u0027s story, Rachel compares the manipulations and reactionary defensiveness of PSL to that of cults who take aggressive and retaliatory action towards all accusers and critics.  Before You Go: Rachel examines the fraudulent nature of internal investigations within high control groups by relating a personal story about dealing with a disingenuous property manager.

Jacob breaks down some of the cult-like tactics of control that were commonplace in his branch. Rachel offers her insights into the groups\u0027 use of manipulative language and pressure to overachieve to the point of exhaustion. They discuss in detail the restrictive nature of the organization, as well as its intolerance of dissent both in public and private.

      "description": "Anna grew up in a fundamentalist Christian family as part of the Quiverfull movement. She and her 6 siblings were not allowed to attend school and were very isolated from the outside world. Everything about her childhood was strictly controlled, from the clothes she wore to the media she had access to. She was expected to teach herself from primarily religious texts as well as teaching and caring for the younger children. Her future was laid out for her as a submissive wife and mother to many children.  She left at 19 with help from family. Starting life in a very unfamiliar world with little education was daunting but also thrilling. 7 years later she\u0027s still sifting through memories, she makes videos on TikTok (@spookypatootie) recounting her experiences and has found that many other folks grew up in similar circumstances. Many kids are undoubtedly still in that situation and Anna hopes she can raise awareness and play a part in helping others.    In this second half of Anna\u0027s conversation with Rachel, she reflects on the erosion of the relationship with her mother and explains how her homophobic beliefs became the catalyst for Anna\u0027s departure from home and the Quiverfull movement. Anna shares some of the many difficulties she experienced trying to find her way in a world she was inherently ill-equipped to navigate. Throughout the discussion, Rachel points out some of the common struggles of those who were not raised with the basic life skills the general population takes for granted.  Before You Go: Rachel offers some advice on defining \u0022normalcy\u0022 for people leaving restrictive groups for the first time and explains how others can be an invaluable resource to those struggling to thrive in an unfamiliar world.

Many kids are undoubtedly still in that situation and Anna hopes she can raise awareness and play a part in helping others.    Anna provides some background on the Christian movement Quiverfull, a theological position held by some conservative Christian couples who belong to Evangelical denominations that see large families as blessings from God. She explains some of the neglectful practices her parents employed led by their extreme interpretation of biblical texts. Anna shares with Rachel some of her deepest vulnerabilities from childhood and how she struggled to deal with them as an adult. Throughout the conversation, Rachel points out some of the commonalities in adults who have experienced religious-based parental neglect as children.  Before You Go: Rachel addresses the struggle that children who grow up isolated by religion experience trying to fit in with peers.

In her time in MLM, she was involved as a consultant for 3; It Works!, LuLaRoe and Modere, and a customer of many. Since leaving MLM, she has educated herself on the systemic structure of the business model, the psychological manipulation, the seedy underbelly, and governmental ties, the cult indoctrination, and the history of Multi-Level Marketing. She educates daily on TikTok, and podcasts in her \u0022free time\u0022, talking to the survivors and victims of these commercial cults, disguised as the quickest route to the American Dream.  In this second part of their two-part conversation, Rachel begins by sharing how she lost a friendship to an MLM, while Roberta goes on to describe the moment that prompted her to finally leave the MLM world. Roberta details a day in the life of a \u0022hun\u0022 and how she ultimately extricated herself from the pyramid. She also discussed her transition into \u0022hun\u0022 advocacy and anti-MLM activism through both education and humor.

She educates daily on TikTok, and podcasts in her \u0022free time\u0022, talking to the survivors and victims of these commercial cults, disguised as the quickest route to the American Dream.  In this first part of their two-part conversation, Roberta explains to Rachel how she works to end the stigma of failure in the MLM industry, which she explains is designed for failure. Together they unpack the tactics of the now infamous MLM, LuLaRoe, that Roberta says signifies a commercial cult. Roberta shares her emotional journey as she transitions from \u0022hun\u0022 to anti-MLM activist providing a detailed analysis of the schemes used in this deceptive and dangerous industry.  Before You Go: Rachel expands on the concept of the sunk cost fallacy and points out some of the many examples where it can be found, offering insights for walking away from deceptive traps.

      "description": "Lola Blanc is a singer/songwriter, filmmaker, actress, and cult survivor. Her single \u201CAngry Too\u201D has over 20 million streams on Spotify, and as a songwriter, Blanc has also written for other artists including Britney Spears. Blanc\u2019s work as a filmmaker has been spotlighted by BILLBOARD, FANGORIA, FUNNY OR DIE, and the prestigious short film channel OMELETO. Much of her work is inspired by her childhood practicing Mormonism, where she and her mother fell prey to a charismatic \u201Cprophet,\u201D who turned out to be a cult leader.   Meagan Elizabeth is a stand-up comedian, writer, and actress from Los Angeles who has performed at the legendary Laugh Factory. She was raised in a high control Christian group known as the Two by Twos, an international, home-based new religious movement that has its origins in Ireland at the end of the 19th century. Among members, the church is typically referred to as \u0022The Truth\u0022 or \u0022The Way\u0022  Together, Lola \u0026 Meagan co-host a podcast called Trust Me: Cults, Extreme Belief, and the Abuse of Power, where they share their experiences and fight the stigma cult survivors are often exposed to. On the show, they have interviewed survivors of groups like NXIVM, the Manson Family, Heaven\u2019s Gate, the Children of God, and many more.  In this week\u0027s conversation, Lola and Meagan share with Rachel their experiences growing up in cults noting the similarities in the control mechanisms used as well as the after-effects that come to light with distance from the group. Together they unravel the patriarchal structure of both groups and explain the work it took for them to overcome this sexist conditioning. Lola and Meagan go on to provide insights on what gave them the courage to leave and discuss how it\u0027s felt to share their personal tragedy in public as a means to fight the stigma and loneliness of other survivors.  Before You Go: Rachel explains how cults take advantage of followers through the use of confession and relates it to Robert J Lifton\u0027s criteria for thought reform. She explains how to share wisely, but also withhold wisely.

      "description": "Returning this week is Thomas who grew up in Denmark with a covert narcissist mother who kept him socially isolated, emotionally abused him, and manipulated his sense of reality. For most of his life, he didn\u2019t realize that anything was wrong, because of the covert nature of the emotional abuse, control, and gaslighting he was exposed to. A year ago he started to get a better grasp of his own reality and slowly began to understand what had really happened. Thomas is back on the show hoping to help others better recognize signs of covert abuse and control.  Thomas continues his conversation with Rachel by explaining what it was like when he first left home, fleeing his narcissistic mother for the first time. He shares with us his inner dialogue as he begins to find true trust and love when he first meets his wife Thomas goes on to explain how his wife helped him unmask the covert narcissistic tendencies of his mother. Throughout the conversation, Rachel helps Thomas unpack the manipulation and emotional neglect he experienced as a child.   Before You Go: Rachel gives advice to people who have experienced emotional sadism and addresses the fear and trepidation that can hinder their growth as a result. She notes that their perpetrators often lack the ability to have regrets or even re-examine their actions.

For most of his life, he didn\u2019t realize that anything was wrong, because of the covert nature of the emotional abuse, control, and gaslighting he was exposed to. A year ago he started to get a better grasp of his own reality and slowly began to understand what had really happened. Thomas is on the show hoping that his story can help others better recognize signs of covert abuse and control.  Thomas explains to Rachel how, in retrospect he came to understand the emotional neglect and covert narcissism he experienced as a child. Rachel provides her insights on the manipulative parenting techniques of Thomas\u0027s mother and explains how they relate to those of cult leaders. Together, they unpack some of the most impactful moments in Thomas\u0027s childhood development and the emotional reverberations that followed.

      "description": "Our returning guest, Claire Headley was born and raised in Scientology and joined Scientology\u0027s \u0022Sea Organization\u0022 at 16, including signing a billion-year contract. In the Sea Org, Claire was quickly promoted to Scientology\u0027s international headquarters in Hemet, California, where she worked for 14 years, including working as an executive in their Religious Technology Center under David Miscavige, Scientology\u0027s current leader. Claire escaped in 2005 at the age of 30, and since that time Claire and her husband Marc (author of Blown for Good: Behind the Iron Curtain of Scientology) have been speaking out against Scientology\u0027s abusive practices. Claire appeared in 3 seasons of Leah Remini: Scientology \u0026 The Aftermath and has contributed to many other documentaries, articles, and radio shows, educating the general public on Scientology. Claire also now serves on the board of The Aftermath Foundation, a non-profit organization that assists people leaving Scientology to start new lives.  In this second half of their two-part conversation, Claire recalls for Rachel the inner emotional turmoil she experienced after escaping from Scientology. Rachel offers her insights on the psychological difficulties that are commonplace among people who have recently extricated themselves from all manner of high control groups. Together they examine the types of support that can help ex-group members recover safely and effectively. Claire explains how her advocacy for survivors has been an intrinsic part of her own healing.    Before You Go: Rachel examines how many high control groups eliminate communication and anything perceived as negativity among its members. This, she explains keeps them isolated in their suffering, and prevents the peer support that gives individuals the courage to leave.

Claire speaks about her traumatic time in the Sea Org starting from the age of 16, she tells the story of meeting her husband Marc there and how their love was the catalyst for her eventual escape. Throughout the conversation, Claire paints a grim picture of life in a secured Scientology compound as she rose to the top of David Miscavige\u0027s Religious Technology Center and the indignities she suffered along the way.  Before You Go:  Rachel explains how Scientology manipulates victimhood into a shameful failure of their followers, so as to not have to take responsibility for their abusive culture.

      "description": "This week\u0027s guest, Spike Robinson was born in the wilds of New Jersey and raised in bustling, metropolitan Vermont, she began her educational career in literary criticism before deciding to go for broke (literally) and study music theory and composition. One completed degree and three years in a \u201Critual magick\u201D cult later, she found a new life path educating others about coercive control, manipulative persuasion, and the many nefarious ways predatory people fool us into acting against our own best interests. She currently manages the YouTube channel of author Jon Atack and lives with her ever-patient husband and two budgerigars.  Spike shares her fascinating and often dark story of enchantment, psychedelia, and \u0022Crowley-Esque, ritual magik.\u0022 Together Spike and Rachel explore the textbook scenarios that led her into the arms of a narcissistic and abusive cult leader. Spike also talks about how hearing from ex-Scientologists helped her walk away from her own dark and strange group and create a new life for herself protecting people from systems of control.  Before You Go: Rachel reiterates how intelligence levels have no bearing on what makes one susceptible to cultic indoctrination, and warns of the dangers of sacrificial devotion explaining how it can be exploited by abusive group leaders.

      "description": "This week\u0027s guest, Marilyn Mayo, is the Research Fellow at the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s (ADL) Center on Extremism. Marilyn is an expert on right-wing extremists in the United States, ranging from white supremacists to academic racists to anti-immigrant groups.  She has been with the ADL for 24 years, having previously served as the Associate Director of Investigative Research.   Marilyn shares her insights from decades of investigation on hate groups and extremism as a research fellow with the ADL. She breaks down the complex roots of extremist hate and unravels some of the difficult social issues that government must address in order to quell the many violent extremist movements currently threatening the United States. Rachel draws parallels between extremist hate groups and cultic high control groups, both in the recruitment tactics used as well as the potential for the violence these groups inherently hold. Marylin and Rachel go on to discuss deradicalization strategies and the important educational resources offered by the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s (ADL) Center on Extremism.  Before You Go: Rachel explains that despite how the ever-changing landscape of hate and extremism continues to morph into different ideologies, its root cause remains the same, that ugly side of human nature that we must all continue to fight against collectively.

      "description": "Our guest this week, Beth Matenaer, is a licensed professional counselor and trauma therapist living in South Carolina, who has worked with adults, children, adolescents, and families for more than 25 years. As a survivor of the Troubled Teen Industry, she has devoted her decades-long career to treating clients who exhibit the complexity of post-traumatic stress (PTSD) and other victims of high-conflict systems. Additionally, she is the co-creator and Clinical Director of the innovative Think Boxing program. As an adolescent, she was sent to a program heavily modeled after the Synanon cult. This self-help style school used attack therapy, loss of personal agency, physical labor, and isolation from friends and family as a way to tear down \u201Ctroubled\u201D teenagers in order to reform them.   Throughout their conversation, Beth shares with Rachel both her clinical expertise and personal experience, she sheds light on complex trauma or (CPTSD) and how it often goes unrecognized or mistreated. Beth also tells the story of her traumatic time at a \u0022Troubled Teen\u0022 program, where she was subjected to unhealthy \u201Ccultic\u201D and exploitative relationships with staff members. She goes on to explain what happened when she ran away from the program and how her experiences inspired her to become a therapist focusing largely on misunderstood youth, traumatized children and adults, and highly dysfunctional family systems.  Before You Go: Rachel emphasizes the importance of conducting research into any program before becoming involved, especially for parents who are often deceived by programs in the \u0022Troubled Teen\u0022 industry. Rachel gives some tips on what parents should look out for when scouting programs and offers some advice on how to maintain a trusting relationship with their children.

      "description": "In the late 1970s, while Pam was in college, she got involved with Scientology doing many courses and counseling with them. She stayed in Scientology a long time, but around 2001, Pam was in a terrible accident where she broke her neck throwing her into the medical world of surgeries, medicines, doctors, etc. During her recovery, Pam wanted off the medicines, so she got involved with Scientology\u2019s form of \u201CDrug Rehab\u201D called \u201CNarconon\u201D. Not knowing what to expect, she first went to their facility in the LA area which turned out to be a 3-month nightmare for her, so they flew her to Montreal, Canada to a sister Narconon for many months. Pam desperately hoped they would keep their promises to help her, but this did not happen. These unbelievable experiences badly affected both her mental and physical health. At one point she was down to 84 lbs often having continuous seizures with no one qualified to watch over her, finding herself staying alone in an old Canadian farmhouse for months with little food, medical care, or even a phone- which also turned out to be deadly for her. She felt like a prisoner jailed in a foreign country not knowing anyone or even being able to speak their language. What could she do? This is her grueling story as to how it all happened, Narconon\u2019s lack of any help whatsoever, and how she managed to escape back to her parents in the United States where her years of recovery began. In this conclusion of Rachel\u0027s two-part conversation with Pam, she tells the story of how she ended up being transferred to a remote Canadian farmhouse, where she was trapped alone and suffering for weeks. She details the heroic steps a young girl took to help get her to a travel agency where she was eventually able to get home to her parents. Rachel provides insights on the trauma Pam experienced and her long and difficult road to recovery. Before You Go: Rachel provides some psychological context to what Pam experienced throughout her ordeal. She breaks down the difficulties of complex trauma and the Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome many in her position struggle with. Thanks to all our newest Patreon supporters!

Govinda has been an IT consultant in banking and a successful internet entrepreneur. He has traveled the world in search of communities and alternative ways of living before he co-founded \u0022Awake\u0022 in Costa Rica in 2020, a community and center dedicated to support and accelerate what he calls human awakening.   Govinda describes for Rachel the experiences he had at Sat Yoga, an ashram and school in Costa Rica led by Shunyamurti (aka Robert Shubow) He explains the red flags he noticed in the leader and the cultic tactics he used to manipulate the minds of his followers. Rachel breaks down the common psychological traits of cult leaders while Govinda points out where these traits were present in Shunyamurti. Govinda goes on to share how his negative experiences led him to co-found the website www.satyoga.exposed/ which offers a different perspective on the nature of the organization and a voice for the numerous past members of the cult who have had a personal relationship with Shunyamurti.  Before You Go: Rachel speaks about what disillusioned followers can experience when they finally see cracks in the facade of a controlling leader, and what signs are visible when a leader hides their true self.

      "description": "This week\u0027s guest, Zoe Scurletis is a young professional who is currently based out of Austin, Texas.  For most of her adult life, Zoe battled anxiety and depression, and in 2017 she lost a close friend to suicide.  She longed to do something to bring awareness to the mental health community, so in October of 2019, she launched a mental health podcast called Solace and the City\u2122. Through authentic conversations about sensitive subjects, she works to open up the conversation around emotional wellness.  Her goal of the podcast is to reduce the stigma surrounding depression, anxiety, loneliness, and suicide by sharing these powerful stories.  In her conversation with Rachel, Zoe talks about her passion for destigmatizing mental health issues as well as her own struggles with Tourette syndrome. Zoe walks us through the circumstances that led to her experiences with Mark Elliot, an author and public speaker who was a member of NXIVM and claimed his Tourette\u0027s was cured by the cult\u0027s leader Keith Raniere. Zoe shares how she narrowly averted recruitment into NXIVM by Mark, while Rachel points out some of the red flags to watch out for when being persuaded to join a group.  Before You Go: Rachel explains why a promise can hold such tremendous weight on a person\u0027s psychology and the depth to which it can establish or destroy trust in a relationship. She explains the responsibility and emotional maturity needed when making promises to people.

Kandi continues to support him through this process as she continues pursuing her law school where she is due to graduate in May of 2022.  Cody shares with Rachel his experience of being raised in an isolated family compound after being taken away from his parents by other family members involved in the cultic commune. He explains how these relatives attempted to cover up the sex abuse of his mother by elders of the group when she was a child. He talks about experiencing the effects of the religious trauma that affected multiple generations.  Throughout the conversation, Kandi shares her perspective of discovering the abuses and cultic behaviors in Cody\u0027s family and explains her thought process as she slowly and graciously led her husband away from the trauma and indoctrination of his family. Kandi explains the negative effects these destructive relatives had on their relationship and what she did to overcome the difficulties.  Before You Go: Rachel examines the ingrained fears that people who grow up with apocalyptic doctrine experience and the difficulties they have in shedding those worries later in life.

      "description": "CONTENT WARNING: SUICIDAL IDEATION  Our guest this week, Geoff Law, was raised a Jehovah\u0027s Witness in Northern California. As a Witness, he spent 35 years devoted to bible research using only Witness-approved publications, attending three weekly meetings, and spending upwards of 70 hours each month spreading the Jehovah\u2019s Witness doctrine, trying to convert future members. His zeal for his beliefs led him as far as moving to Shanghai, China to proselytize underground, an activity that is currently banned by the government. Geoff grew up identifying as gay in a religion that does not allow its members the ability to identify as part of the LGBTQ\u002B community. The constant bombardment of homophobic rhetoric, being taught to believe being gay is a choice and is wrong, forced to come out to leaders in the congregation, to confess thought crimes and \u201Csins\u201D, and told to pray the \u201Csame-sex attraction\u201D away, eventually caused so much self-loathing and depression that suicide seemed the only option.   In 2019, Geoff decided to come out to his friends and family and leave the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses for good. Since leaving the organization, he\u2019s been on a journey of self-discovery, unwinding deeply ingrained ideologies of sexuality and spirituality, instead of learning to live authentically as a member of the LGBTQ\u002B community. He is focused on getting the truth about the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses out to the general public and encourages anyone that identifies as LGBTQ\u002B in the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Organization or in other similar high control groups to find freedom and self-love as they live an authentic and truthful life.    In today\u0027s conversation, Geoff walks Rachel through his experience of growing up gay as a Jehovah\u0027s Witness. He explains the difficulties of discovering his sexuality as a young man while navigating the shame and self-hatred he felt because of the archaic and homophobic beliefs of the church. He explains how the homophobic rhetoric of his high control church created in him intense feelings of isolation that eventually led to suicidal ideation. Geoff details his guilt-ridden confessions to the church and also reveals some of the ignorant and hateful writings on homosexuality that can be found in the Church\u0027s official archive to this day,    Before You Go: Rachel examines the intolerance of some fundamentalist religious households and explains what a virtue and gift acceptance is not only for families but for society as a whole.

      "description": "Returning this week are actors, Andrea Geones and Michael Laskin. Andrea and Michael teamed up to create a code of ethics for acting classes with one goal in mind: to create a safe and healthy environment for actors and acting students. After experiencing the unhealthy and cult-like culture fostered within many acting classes where sexual, financial, and psychological abuse were the norm, they created https://www.findyouractingclass.com/ and wrote a code of conduct for acting teachers to agree to and endorse, as well as guidelines to help teachers ensure that they are running their classes ethically.  Andrea is a Los Angeles native. In addition to acting and piano, she has studied singing, guitar, and flute. She currently is in school earning a b.s. in nutritional sciences while she pursues her career in acting. She is also a freelance writer for online publications, including where she originally wrote about the cult-like atmosphere of acting classes. You can find her article here: https://www.wordsbetweencoasts.com/actors-beware-you-may-be-in-a-cult/  Michael Laskin has been a working actor for over 40 years, across all platforms:  film, theatre, and television.  Twelve years ago he started The Michael Laskin Studio, an acting studio in Los Angeles.  His book, \u201CThe Authentic Actor - the Art and Business of Being Yourself\u201D  has been praised as a fresh, newly examined, and non-dogmatic approach to the work and the life of an actor.  In the second half of Rachel\u0027s two-part discussion with Andrea and Michael, the actors break down their code of ethics and describe the personal experiences that directly inform many of the guidelines. Andrea explains the feelings of vulnerability and helplessness that acting students often feel and shares about the emotional abuse she experienced from teachers. Michael provides more insight from his perspective as an experienced teacher and explains how his outrage at the abusive practices became a catalyst to join Andrea in pursuit of a healthier and safer environment for students.  Before You Go: Rachel examines how systems of control keep people in place by manipulating them into a feeling of scarcity and explains why claims of exclusivity can be a red flag.

      "description": "Lisa got out of a small, suburban, new age, therapy-based group in 2016, which she had joined as a 19-year-old, single mother. This high-demand group went through many phases over the 30 years she was involved.  The charismatic, narcissistic leader utilized modalities such as rebirthing, affirmations, hot seat talk therapy, sleep deprivation, as well as verbal, physical, and sexual abuse as a means to control. These techniques combined with intervals of positive reinforcement held her captive in a sealed system where all efforts towards personal success were directed to benefit the leader. Creative endeavors were quashed if it meant confidence and self-esteem were to be gained. In 2015, there were enough cracks that Lisa realized that she could never become the person she joined the group to be if she stayed.   Since Lisa got out, she married the man who helped her find her way back to herself and out of the group. Lisa is passionate about supporting other cult survivors to find their own voices and share their own stories\u2026and for those voices and stories to be heard, acknowledged, and understood.  Lisa shares her experiences of being in an abusive high control group for decades, she explains what it was like joining as a single teenage mother and examines the differences between being raised in a cult vs joining one as an adult. Lisa then examines what led to her finally leaving the group and what triggered her passion for supporting cult survivors once she left. She continues the conversation by talking about #igotout the movement she founded to bring survivor\u0027s stories to the public.   Before You Go: Rachel provides her professional insights on what an unhealthy therapeutic experience looks like, and how to keep yourself safe from a potentially harmful situation. To hear Rachel dive deeper into this topic, you can watch her video here: https://youtu.be/EEBo_Z2VTqE  For more information on Lisa\u0027s #igotout movement please visit: https://www.igotout.org/  Thanks to Maura Campbell-Balkits for increasing their monthly pledge on Patreon!!

      "description": "Christopher Buckley of LaFayette, GA is an Afghanistan and Iraqi war veteran. When he returned from Iraq, he joined the Georgia White Knights as an Imperial Nighthawk, because their anti-Muslim and racist values were consistent with his worldview after returning from war. Arno Michaelis, a former white power skinhead, and\u202FDr. Heval Mohamed Kelli, a Kurdish Muslim refugee, were able to teach Chris the error of his ways and helped bring him out of the movement. Today, he volunteers at The Haven in Georgia, a local organization that helps homeless and drug addicts. He also gives motivational speeches, trying to spread awareness and educate the public about the dangers of white supremacist extremism. Chris now works with Dr. Kelli on a program called Help, Heal, Love; where they work to repair flawed thinking in hate groups and spread a message of love and healing. He also created a deradicalization program designed specifically with veterans in mind but is geared to work with all manners of hate and extremist ideology.  Melissa Buckley is Christopher Buckley\u2019s wife and a key person in helping her husband leave the Ku Klux Klan. She realized that the KKK was damaging to Chris and their children and wanted a healthier path for the well-being of her entire family. She searched online to try and find someone to help her get Chris out of the KKK and found Arno Michaelis, a former white power skinhead, and Parents for Peace advisory board member. Over a several-month period, Melissa worked with Arno to help pull Chris out of the dangerous extremism he had become involved with. Thanks to the support of Melissa and Arno, Chris is now an inspirational model that spreads awareness about the dangers of white supremacist extremism and teaches others how to help their family members who have become involved with extremism.  In this follow-up episode, Chris and Melissa share the details of the intense emotional journey that deradicalization brought to their relationship. Melissa explains how she went about planning the intervention that eventually led to Chris getting sober and leaving the KKK. Together they tell the story of how their love for each other gave them the strength to not only deradicalize Chris but completely transform his life for the better, of not just him and his family, but also for others who have loved ones involved with extremism.  Before You Go: Rachel examines the strength and resilience that Melissa showed in planning and executing Chris\u0027s rescue from hateful ideology.

      "description": "Elli was raised a third-generation Christian Scientist in Southern California. She left the religion in her late teens and discovered it was a cult in her mid-twenties. Her journey of over 10 years has been undoing the restrictive thinking and false beliefs imprinted since birth and finding out who she is underneath it all. In this conclusion of a three-episode series, Elli shares with Rachel her continued struggle of learning how to process and even recognize emotion in herself and others after leaving the church. She describes the deep and lasting impact being raised to deny the existence of her own emotions has had on her as an adult.  Before You Go:  Rachel addresses the importance of striving to, as Elii said \u0022become yourself\u0022, after leaving a high control group. She also provides insight on how to overcome the fear that often accompanies meeting yourself for the first time.  Thanks to our newest Patron, Thomas La Cour!

In this second part of a three-episode series, Elli continues sharing her story with Rachel and details her experience of starting therapy after leaving the church. She explains the difficulties she had in simply recognizing her own emotions, after being taught from a young age to ignore all feelings and even bodily sensations.  Before You Go: Rachel addresses the importance of titles with regard to health professionals and the fraudulent use of them in Christian Science. She explains how this betrayal of trust can cause mistrust of healthcare workers that can be hard to unlearn.  Thanks to our newest Patron Jackey Good!!

In this first part of a three-episode series, Elli shares with Rachel her story of growing up in a restrictive household and church where she was denied access to any form of medicine or healthcare. Throughout the conversation, Elli provides insight into her uniquely sheltered perspective and explains the confusing and disorienting feelings she experienced while integrating into broader society for the first time.  Before You Go: Rachel addresses Elli\u0027s feelings of confusion surrounding a lack of basic medical language and how it can prevent the solution-oriented thinking that would usually lead to treatment from a doctor.

      "description": "Rachel and Erin Alder are a married couple from Seattle. Shortly after they met they became entangled in a situation within AA where their vulnerabilities were being used to control their behavior by a controlling sponsor. In Rachel\u0027s case, the vulnerability that was exploited was undiagnosed mental illness, specifically Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. While Erin\u2019s biggest vulnerability became whether the marriage was dependent on continued work with this manipulative group leader. Eventually, Rachel and Erin were able to break free from the exploitation of the invasive sponsor and her high-demand group. They share with Rachel the details of how they were pulled into this controlling situation and describe the fears that kept them there for 7 years.   In our third and final episode with Rachel and Erin, they conclude the story of their experiences in a high control AA group. They discuss the difficulties of leaving the group and the after-effects they felt once they finally left it behind.  Before You Go: Rachel emphasizes the importance of taking breaks from high control groups. She explains how it gives your mind a chance to reset and gain a new perspective.

      "description": "Robbie Balonick was raised in a non-religious, household, in middle America in the 1950s and 60s. She was a lifelong seeker who was looking for Truth with a capital \u0022T\u0022 and passed quickly through psychedelics and the Hippy movement as mind-opening doors. After the assassination of the Kennedys and Martin Luther King, she became totally disillusioned with the suburban, capitalistic dreams that her parents would have her follow.  So, she packed up a large backpack and began to travel, for 10 years looking for knowledge about God as did so many other middle-class dropouts of the era. First landing in Europe, then Asia and the Middle East, and eventually the jungles of the Yucatan Peninsula. All of this seeking ended up making Robbie the perfect candidate to be assimilated into a cult.  Eventually, that seeking led Robbie to a lecture by John-Roger (formerly Roger Delano Hinkins) where she had a transcendent experience that pulled her into The Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness (or MSIA) an abusive cultic group was founded in California in 1968 by John-Roger. She eventually left the group after hearing about sexual abuse allegations against the leader by two of his most devoted followers. Robbie shares her journey with the group explaining to Rachel what drew her to the leader and how she eventually left.  Before You Go:  Rachel speaks about the spiritual aftermath of leaving a cultic group. She explains the psychological difficulties inherent when lifting the veil of deception that victims have lived with for so long.

Paula, along with her co-host Adam Felber, ask Rachel about how to define a cult, the rise of cultic tactics in politics, and the intricacies of intervention, while Paula and Adam interject with their comedic takes. We hope you enjoy this lighter, yet still insightful, conversation about a serious topic.  Before You Go: Rachel expands on the idea of interventions and deprogramming and addresses the misconceptions many people have about them. She also shares the dramatic story of a successful intervention in which she was involved.  Thanks to our newest Patreon supporters: Mo, Nancy H, and Mike Ehrenkranz!

      "description": "This week\u0027s guest Dimitri is the son of our previous guest Ariela Sarai. He was introduced to the cultic environment of Avatar courses by his mother at just 8 years old. He grew up heavily involved in the teachings of the group, eventually becoming a teacher of the courses himself at only 12 years old. After leaving college to help his mother through a difficult time, he got his real estate license, became a top salesman, and is now pursuing his passion as a freelance artist.   In this conversation, Daniel shares his unique perspective on growing up with Avatar courses and explains how it has impacted his upbringing. Rachel points out the similarities found between Avatar and Scientology, including the group\u0027s intolerance of being questioned and the accusations that followers experience when speaking out.  Before You Go; Rachel dives deeper into how controlling groups often assign a negative intention to an action of their followers that has no real correlation. She explains how the questioning of one\u0027s motivations can lead to self-doubt and allow manipulators to affect your inner narrative.

      "description": "Micro-Compromises of Integrity w/Ariela Sarai After graduating from Columbia University, Ariela spent almost two years in India, first volunteering for Mother Teresa then studying Tibetan Buddhism. When she returned she got an MSW from the University of Pennsylvania. She worked as a therapist in prisons, hospitals, foster homes, and hospices. Then she established a Private Practice where she supported people who were focused on personal growth.  In the year 2000, she was introduced to an international self-development course called Avatar. She had recently gotten divorced and was struggling with emotions and anxiety. She eventually decided to teach the course and also brought in many new students. She moved up the ranks. Gradually she began to get exhausted and depleted emotionally and financially. She stopped prioritizing family and friends. She was devoted to Avatar for 21 years.  When Covid hit, courses stopped for a little while. She got to feel what it was like to be rested, to be home, to have more time with her boyfriend. She had a break from the treatment she had been getting. She thought things might be improving so she was part of the team that transferred the courses Online. But then she started to experience the same way of being talked to and pressured and felt controlled again. Only this time she could feel the impact it had on her.  In November she finally realized that she was actually involved in a cultic environment. She had sacrificed everything for this group. As soon as she really got this, she had one consultation with a therapist, made an exit plan, and less than 24 hours later she left.  In Part 2 of Ariela\u0027s conversation with Rachel, she describes her inner dialogue as she began to realize the manipulative and controlling tactics Avatar used to keep her devoted for over 20 years. Ariela walks us through her journey of leaving the group, how she summoned the courage to take back control of her life and what she has done to start her healing process.  Before You Go: Rachel explains how high control groups can often stay under the radar of the public for long periods of time and the methods they employ to achieve secrecy through intimidation of their members and former members.

      "description": "After graduating from Columbia University, Ariela spent almost two years in India, first volunteering for Mother Teresa then studying Tibetan Buddhism. When she returned she got an MSW from the University of Pennsylvania. She worked as a therapist in prisons, hospitals, foster homes, and hospices. Then she established a Private Practice where she supported people who were focused on personal growth.  In the year 2000, she was introduced to an international self-development course called Avatar. She had recently gotten divorced and was struggling with emotions and anxiety. She eventually decided to teach the course and also brought in many new students. She moved up the ranks. Gradually she began to get exhausted and depleted emotionally and financially. She stopped prioritizing family and friends. She was devoted to Avatar for 21 years.  When Covid hit, courses stopped for a little while. She got to feel what it was like to be rested, to be home, to have more time with her boyfriend. She had a break from the treatment she had been getting. She thought things might be improving so she was part of the team that transferred the courses Online. But then she started to experience the same way of being talked to and pressured and felt controlled again. Only this time she could feel the impact it had on her.  In November she finally realized that she was actually involved in a cultic environment. She had sacrificed everything for this group. As soon as she really got this, she had one consultation with a therapist, made an exit plan, and less than 24 hours later she left.  In Part 1 of Ariela\u0027s conversation with Rachel, she explains how she first got involved in Avatar, why she thinks it consumed her life for so long, and she shares her feelings of regret about putting the group before everything else in her life, even her family.  Rachel explains some of the methods high control groups use to keep people deeply devoted for long periods of time.  Before You Go: Rachel examines why fulfilling the simple human need of intently listening to someone can be weaponized by high control groups in order to foster a false sense of trust, only to manipulate the victim into a deep and unwavering devotion.

      "description": "When today\u0027s guest Jonathan was 15, he felt lost, alone, and unable to voice the feelings and thoughts that were troubling him. The domestic roles he was fulfilling as a young man and full-time student, including caring for his ill mother while navigating his parent\u0027s divorce, eventually led to him seeking help from a therapist. This therapist gained Jonathan\u0027s trust by appearing to understand and relate to him. Jonathan did not have the experience to know that the healthy boundaries of a therapeutic relationship were never actually there.  From the beginning, this therapist used Jonathan\u0027s vulnerabilities to manipulate his emotions, and to control his relationships with his family and friends in order to isolate him and then insert himself and his wife into those roles. After 11 years of being manipulated, even being made to feel responsible for his therapist\u0027s life and personal needs, Jonathan was able to find a way out.   In this second part of Rachel\u0027s conversation with Jonathan, he continues his emotional and powerful story of being trapped in a long-term abusive relationship with a controlling therapist and his wife. Rachel and Jonathan discuss the significant red flags of this relationship including the therapists\u0027 lack of professional boundaries and expectations of secrecy. Jonathan takes us through his mindstate as he finally reaches his breaking point and escapes the torturous relationship after more than a decade.  Before You Go: Rachel explains why manipulators will often do everything possible to keep their victims\u0027 doubt at bay. She explains the importance of doubt as a safety net that can be key to maintaining healthy critical thinking skills that can illuminate the path to freedom from their control.

      "description": "Daniel is an entrepreneur and was raised inside the church. His journey into understanding the nature of fraud and its application to religion started when he was excommunicated from his church for exposing sexual abuse. This has led him to ask the hard questions around his most deeply held beliefs. He has found healing through conversations around faith and abuse. He shares very personal stories with the hope that it will help others to find strength and healing.  Rachel and Daniel have a wide-ranging discussion examining the logic behind the ideology of creationism. Daniel points out the common misconceptions of biblical literalism and by extension highlights the presuppositions that lead to vastly different interpretations of the biblical texts. Daniel explains why often in the most divisive issues the truth lies somewhere in the middle. He also expands on why difficult and honest conversations are key to unifying the most divided factions in both religion and politics.  Before You Go: Rachel revisits Daniel\u0027s idea that religion is a sense-making apparatus. She examines the most important sense-making mechanism, the question, \u0022Why?\u0022  Thanks to our newest Patreon supporters: Adrienne Martasin, Virginia Smith, and Adam Arnold!

      "description": "In a special episode, this week Rachel speaks about Heaven\u0027s Gate, the UFO religious cult based near San Diego, California. Founded in 1974. Rachel provides some background on the group\u0027s leaders Marshall Applewhite and Bonnie Nettles and their teachings. She explains the importance in our times specifically of remembering the tragedy of the group\u0027s ritual suicide. In March 1997, 18 women and 21 men drank a lethal mixture of phenobarbital and vodka and then laid down to die, hoping to leave their \u0022bodily containers\u0027, and enter an alien spacecraft.   Rachel considers the mindstate of these lost individuals by examining their \u0022Exit Statements\u0022. These statements were recorded directly before the suicides in an attempt to explain the motivations behind their actions to the public. These videos, while often disturbing, provide an intimate insight into the psyche of seemingly intelligent and logical people who have been so fully indoctrinated that they can plainly and fully justify their extreme actions.  Rachel provides an analysis of the deep-seated issues, vulnerabilities, and tragic misinterpretations of the victims as well as the leaders that ultimately lead to their untimely demise.

He was originally trained as an actor at Northwestern University with the renowned teacher Uta Hagen in New York City. Dan later worked as a missionary for an Indian guru. His eventual recognition of cultic aspects of his organization led him to become an outspoken activist in support of individuals and families. Traumatically abused in cults, simultaneous with leaving this group, Dan began his training in the mental health profession becoming a faculty member and supervisor at the National Institute for the Psychotherapies in New York publishing papers on psychoanalytic inquiry, contemporary psychoanalysis, and psychoanalytic dialogues and most recently published his book, Traumatic Narcissism, Relational Systems of Subjugation for the relational perspective series, which was nominated for the distinguished Gradiva Award in 2018, the International Cultic Studies Association awarded him the Margaret Thaler Singer Award for advancing the understanding of coercive persuasion and undue influence. Dan\u0027s book, Traumatic Narcissism and Recovery, Leaving the Prison of Shame and Fear, will be published by Routledge in 2021.  Dan and Rachel discuss how the collective disassociation of the U.S. from its own brutal origins has shaped the current political landscape and is in fact a case of \u0022history not remembered is repeated\u0022 They consider possible solutions by utilizing early education and collaborative de-radicalization. Dan provides his analysis of the roots of the sociological issues in the country that have led to tragic events such as the Capitol Insurrection.   Before You Go: Rachel explains the dangers of under-educating citizens about the historical abuses perpetrated by systems of control. She describes the part of human nature that can ultimately lead to a cyclical repetition of historical tragedies.

      "description": "Lola Binkerd is an Author and Actress who was born and raised as a fourth-generation member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormon) in Salt Lake City, Utah. She has lived in Los Angeles for 16 years and her horror anthology \u0022The River God and Other Stories\u0022 and short story \u00224-H\u0022 are available as eBooks on Gumroad and Amazon.   Lola details how being raised in a particularly patriarchal Mormon Church set her up to seek out unhealthy relationships with men as an adult. She shares her experiences dealing with a manipulative and narcissistic love interest. Lola breaks down the learned mindset that allowed her to be drawn into a problematic relationship rife with gaslighting and deception.  Before You Go: Rachel explains how growing up love-starved as a child can leave you very confused about what love is and make you vulnerable to manipulation in your adult relationships. Rachel also shares her thoughts on the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol last week. She gives insight into how people can so easily be indoctrinated into an ideology of hate and be driven to participate in tragically violent incidents. ***Rachel is speaking today about the Capitol Hill riots only to show the power of a leader\u0027s influence as it connects to the theme of the podcast.  She is not taking a political stance (Republican vs. Democrat) and therefore is not inviting political debate or political comments.

Lola shares with Rachel her experiences as a child growing up in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and explains how those experiences have affected her as an adult. She describes the toxic effects of raising girls to believe blind obedience and total self-sacrifice are feminine virtues, and how teaching girls to marry and defer to the right kind of man sets them up to be the victims of narcissists and high-control groups, even if they leave the religion/group itself.  Before You Go: Rachel expands on Lola\u0027s childhood experience of being made to feel that her needs are secondary to those perceived to be higher up in the religious hierarchy of the church. She compares it to her own childhood experiences as the \u0022baby\u0022 of the family and how it affected her relationships as an adult.

      "description": "Stacie Stukin is an arts and culture journalist who grew up in Los Angeles. She was a contributing editor at Yoga Journal and she\u2019s also written about yoga for the Los Angeles Times and Time Magazine. Over the years, she\u2019s had the opportunity to write about and practice many different forms of the practice including Kundalini Yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan. This past July, she wrote a comprehensive investigative piece for Los Angeles Magazine about the current sexual misconduct allegations against Yogi Bhajan and the subsequent reckoning within the 3HO community.  Philip Deslippe is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara and holds an MA from the University of Iowa. He has written articles for several academic journals including Ameriasia and the Journal of Yoga Studies, and pieces for numerous popular venues such as Yoga Journal and Tricycle.  Philip was a member of 3HO for about a decade after taking a Kundalini Yoga class at his undergraduate college in the mid-1990s. He left in 2008 and went on to conduct research into the origins of Yogi Bhajan\u0027s Kundalini Yoga that culminated in the ground-breaking 2012 article \u0022From Maharaj to Mahan Tantric\u0022 for Sikh Formations.  Rachel continues her wide-ranging discussion with these foremost 3HO researchers as they go in-depth about their respective work exposing Yogi Bhajan. Stacie and Phillip talk about their experiences covering the group and the aftermath of their revelatory reporting.  Before You Go: Rachel discusses \u0022SGA\u0027s\u0022 or second-generation cult members and explains the damage that can be done, especially to children who are born into the isolation of compound life. She shares her experiences working with people leaving these sheltered environments and the struggles they have integrating into the greater society.

      "description": "Daniel is an entrepreneur and was raised inside the church. His journey into understanding the nature of fraud and its application to religion started when he was excommunicated from his church for exposing sexual abuse. This has led him to ask the hard questions around his most deeply held beliefs. He has found healing through conversations around faith and abuse. He shares very personal stories with the hope that it will help others to find strength and healing.  Rachel and Daniel discuss the shared tactics of fraudulent businesses and coercive religious groups, while Daniel goes in-depth about the personal experiences behind his motivation to educate people about the archetypes of fraud in all of its forms.  Before You Go: Rachel touches on Robert Cialdini\u0027s concept of \u0022pre-suasion\u0022, the idea of strategically conveying messages in order to make someone more open to subsequent manipulation. She offers advice on how to notice the signs of \u0022pre-suasion\u0022 in order to avoid this subtle but powerful form of influence.

      "description": "Brooke Knaack is a licensed marriage and family therapist and registered art therapist based in Los Angeles who has over ten years of clinical experience. She currently sees clients at her private practice where she uses cognitive, relational, and somatic techniques to help individuals with developmental trauma or dysfunctional families cultivate healthy boundaries and relationships. Brooke was introduced to the 12-step program of AA in her early twenties and went on to be a very active member for 14 years before she started to question aspects of the organization. Since leaving AA in early 2018, Brooke has expanded her practice to include supporting clients that are transitioning away from controlling systems and learning to trust themselves again.  Brooke shares her nuanced view of her experiences while being fully immersed in the 12 step program of Alcoholics Anonymous. While the group did help her stay sober, Brooke carefully points out some of the serious flaws and potentially damaging lack of professional oversight inherent in the program. She explains how in retrospect, her new perspective from the point of view of a mental health professional provided clarity on her own experience and allowed her to see the potential risks for certain vulnerable populations.  Before You Go: Rachel goes into detail about the importance of safeguards in recovery groups of all kinds and reiterates the idea that these groups can often be both beneficial and counter-productive simultaneously.

      "description": "Erin Aquarian is an artist and musician living in Portland, Oregon. Around the age of 26, she began to explore spirituality, particularly witchcraft, to try to heal herself and make her life better. In 2012 she became involved with a \u201Cmystery school\u201D for four years. Though she thought this school was helping her become her true self living a life of meaning and purpose, the school was rife with dysfunctional dynamics which deepened the wounds she showed up with and caused new ones she is now trying to heal from. Currently, Erin is recovering from eight years of being manipulated, gaslit, and misled by the people involved in this community, and others she has met and worked within various spirituality/healing modalities.    Erin shares her experience healing from the damage the school inflicted on her and others. She emphasizes the importance of working only with licensed and trained mental health professionals on her recovery journey and exposes the dangers of the unregulated healing industry.  Make sure to tune into the intro this week where Rachel addresses the importance of finding safe ways to connect this holiday season.  Before You Go: Rachel explains how people can be more vulnerable to recruitment by cultic groups during times of existential crisis, especially after the loss of loved ones. She describes why people in these fragile states must avoid those who claim to have all the answers they seek.

      "description": "After four successful years of working on TV shows and films in New York City, Jules Hartley thought it would be a good idea for her to move to LA.  A couple of years into her Hollywood journey, she discovered Kundalini yoga as taught specifically by Yogi Bhajan and the Golden Bridge Yoga Studio in Hollywood. She was instantly hooked and began what turned into a seven and a half year stint as a hardcore and fanatical member of what is now The Rama Yoga Institute, 3HO, and their brand of Sikhism.  The yoga and meditation lifestyle given by Yogi Bhajan thus became her entire universe, and within a year or two, she was devoting up to 18 hours a day, to practices that Yogi Bhajan said would ultimately make her life better and get her to \u0022ascend\u0022.  Jules explains to Rachel why she ultimately ended up leaving Hollywood in 2018, very sick after her experiences, and completely broke as she had given her money over to this group. She details her experiences leaving the intense systemic control of this cultic yoga group and provides insight on her journey to recovery.   Before You Go: Rachel shares her perspective on the results of the 2020 U.S Presidential Election and provides insight into why people who have left cults were so triggered by the US president for the last 4 years and how he behaved,  and were so troubled by seeing how many militant hate groups and conspiratorial groups like QAnon felt supported by him.

He has written over a hundred comic book stories and has twice been nominated for Comic-Con\u0027s Eisner Award. He went on to publish The Negro Motorist Green Book - Jim Crow-era travel guides for African Americans, an important historical document previously out of print.   Rachel and Nat discuss how representation in influential forms of popular media can create a positive form of indoctrination that can ultimately lead to progressive societal change.  Before You Go: Rachel expands on the idea of representation in media and the positive impact it can have in minority communities of all kinds. She compares it to the affirmation people who\u0027ve left cultic groups feel when their experiences are shared with the majority through mass media.

      "description": "Tammie Willis grew up in a Christian fundamentalist church in Virginia that she now knows was a cult by the ways in which it abused and controlled its members. She explains how her church, school, and family life were all steeped in methods of control based on fear, abuse, dependency, coercion, and obedience at all costs. Tammie describes how although she\u0027s been away from fundamentalism for 30 years, she\u0027s still coming to terms with how her life has been affected. She goes on to explain how seeing what is happening in the United States political system and the rise of Christian nationalism has been eye-opening and triggering for her.  Before you go: Rachel discusses religious trauma and spiritual abuse, which despite being frighteningly commonplace are still relatively unknown to the public. She describes ways in which these abuses can manifest themselves throughout the lives of those who are victimized by them.

He spent a good part of the late 80\u0027s and early 90s shooting anti-apartheid films before going to Hollywood. He has traveled two parallel paths in his life so far. One working his way up the ranks of the camera department in the film industry, eventually becoming a film Director... and the other an unquenchable thirst for self-knowledge. This quest led him through many different religions and self-help organizations. It all came crashing down in 2017 when Mark found out that the company he was working with, and the mentor that led it, was hiding illegal and deeply immoral activities. Before he could even begin to heal, he and a few other brave souls had to become whistleblowers to expose what they were discovering. The journey of taking down the NXIVM organization and its key figures are captured in the 9 part HBO Documentary Series \u0022THE VOW\u0022 currently on the air. In this second part of their conversation,  Mark describes how recognizing the patterns in Raniere\u0027s manipulations helped him unravel his disturbing web of deception.  Before You Go: Rachel describes how manipulators benefit from their victims\u0027 natural tendency to resist information that contradicts their beliefs.

This week she continues telling her story about working in multi level marketing, how she chose to leave, and the loss, anger and fear she was left with.  Audrey shares the ways that she taught her team to be successful salespeople through a process called \u0022duplication\u0022. The idea is to foster several other apprentices to support the company the way that you already do. This involved providing scripts for online selling events and sharing formulaic tips on how to market for Facebook and other social media.

      "description": "Audrey was formerly a high-ranking member of a multi-level marketing scheme. She was drawn to the opportunity to start paying off her student debts. Because of personal safety concerns, we are keeping some details anonymous. However, many pyramid schemes have successfully marketed themselves as notable brands.   It was a group that fostered positivity by pushing each team of hungry entrepreneurs like herself to buy their success in the group through recruitments and sales. Flexing cruises, cars, and conventions on social media was a way to advertise the lifestyle of working for the brand, in order to sell the job. She began to realize that most of her relationships and conversations had the goal of selling more products-- and that it was time to end this part of her business career.

Along with his father Carey Peck, they brainstorm how to foster new perspectives and strengths within communities. \u0022People will always respond to people\u0022, says Carey, \u0022and being united in action is critical.\u0022 He stresses the importance of taking the first step together as a community to organize change.

It is nearly impossible to determine the amount of psychological damage this causes to both men and women. Roisin truly hopes that her film \u0022Run\u0022 evokes an awakening for those who can then recognize mental manipulation within their own families and communities. The protagonist is a well-educated woman whose information was micromanaged by her controlling partner, whom she trusted. It can happen to anyone. Roisin also shows that if you want to intervene or offer support, it\u0027s best for the conversation to start with compassion rather than blame.

Today we finish the three-part episode by reminiscing on their first secret reunion, and their long journey of rebuilding their connection.   Sarabeth\u0027s abusive pastor painted all types of female independence as a sin. Cyndy was demonized for choosing to get a divorce. The restrictions put on her made it even more important for Sarabeth to reach out to her mother. The two arranged to meet in ultimate rebellion at a Women\u0027s Conference and began their journey of reconnection. It was several more years before Sarabeth finally left the cult a year ago. She attributes her mind for critical thinking to her love of literature, which Cyndy found much pride in fostering with her homeschooled daughters. One is still inside the cult.

This week we hear the inside story from her daughter, Sarabeth.  Sarabeth grew up in a cult for 25 years before falling into another group masquerading as a Baptist church. In both groups, members were not allowed to question authority because that would be challenging God\u0027s word. Her faith in scripture was used to convince her to move in with several other young women and live above the pastor\u0027s garage.   Sarabeth also talks about a phenomenon she has experienced in both groups idealizing submissive women: the requirement to grow up and support the men by being a stay-at-home daughter. With the mind of an attorney and educator, she was able, in retrospect, to decode her manipulator and realize that both cults were using scripture out of context to create fear and control.

      "description": "Joe Szimhart found his path to cultic studies through his art community in Santa Fe and the Agni Yoga Society. Here he met Margaret Singer of the anti-cult movement as well as the notorious mystic theosophist Madame Blavatsky. Helena (Madame) Blavatsky was known for openly plagiarizing existing gnostic theories as the doctrine for the Church Universal Triumphant cultic group. Joe helps us cite her sources and talks about the developing study of extreme belief groups over the past forty years.   As someone who has been involved in many successful interventions, he encourages those seeking to intervene to try and understand why the person chose to join this group specifically. Often the situation has less to do with the actual belief system, and more to do with what the group has to offer its members. Rachel and Joe also discuss the wave of mysticism and astrology in Millenials and his most recent research as a cult interventionist and consultant.  You can order Joe Szimhart\u0027s latest book, \u0022Santa Fe, Bill Tate, and Me\u0022 out on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Santa-Fe-Bill-Tate-interventionist/dp/1676003886  Stay tuned, Before You Go: The show ends with Rachel\u0027s thoughts about fearing the end of the world.

Hall is a playwright and the author of \u0022Reclaiming my Decade Lost in Scientology\u0022.  Hear what brought Sands into Scientology in the first part:  https://soundcloud.com/indoctrinationshow/sands-hall  Creating a hive-mind supremacy is how authoritarian groups exert their power and control. Without critically thinking about biases when they\u0027re offered as a simple explanation, people can adopt really ugly attitudes towards \u0027outsiders\u0027. When a new idea challenges a psychologically manipulated world view, intentionally or unintentionally, there are many roadblocks to reaching a common ground. If someone believes deeply in the \u0027ends\u0027, they could find themselves justifying the \u0027means\u0027-- even if those actions are not normally within one\u0027s character.  Sands shares how the Scientology Doubt Formula prevented her from questioning the doctrine of the group.

      "description": "Today we begin a new year! For many, this is a much needed fresh start. Sands Hall, playwright and author of \u0022Reclaiming my Decade Lost in Scientology\u0022 talks about how to take back what can seem like lost years.  A common phrase among many survivors of abusive organizations is \u0022I can\u0027t believe how many years I did that\u0022. Most people don\u0027t believe that they could slowly be indoctrinated to believe in things that are contradictory to their character. When a person leaves a manipulative group, they have to learn to trust themselves and face their learned fears, especially when speaking out against an abuser. Sands\u0027s fears came true, but she and her story stood strong-- when Scientology attempted to remove her book from Amazon.   You can find her book on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Flunk-Start-Reclaiming-Decade-Scientology-ebook/dp/B071P44P9R  Stay tuned, Before You Go: People often forget how their minds can be changed; little by little. Rachel explains Sands Hall\u0027s phrase \u0022screwing on the viewfinder\u0022, used to describe the way one\u0027s worldview can be altered in microscopic increments.

      "description": "Kernan Coleman became an activist and critical thinking advocate after losing loved ones who denied the existence of HIV though they were effected. He shares his encounters with celebrities and their belief systems, and how growing up agnostic affected his skepticism as he navigated the world of entertainment.  Kernan brings a vivid language to his perspective on anti-vax culture, and discusses other uses of mysticism that can cloud critical thinking and cause people to act on myths. He advises everyone to steer themselves away from \u0027grief vampires\u0027 that offer false but convenient information to people who have suffered a loss and are searching for answers. Kernan\u0027s evolution from \u0027science geek kid\u0027, to credulous new ager, to becoming an advocate for critical thinking and scientific skepticism- is a work in progress.

He shares the knowledge he\u0027s acquired over more than thirty years as an academic.  Stephen attended University of Maryland in the early seventies and witnessed his campus respond to the Cambodian invasion in protest. Oddly, by the time he came to graduate, he began to notice an increasing popularity of Maharishis, gurus, and cults. These observations inspired Stephen to continue his studies in graduate school with a major in Hinduism and a minor in Gnosticism.   Rachel and Stephen\u0027s discussion expresses concern for the effects of incentivized academics that are incorporated into cults. Media, marketing, and politicians help to legitimize groups and leaders-- but what are the consequences when they become biased?  Stay tuned, Before You Go: While developing an \u0027inner circle\u0027 can be a good source of support, it can be important to have your ideas challenged.

      "description": "Stacey Aviva Flint was born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio, and was a spiritual seeker from a young age though her family wasn\u0027t tied to a religion. She was approached by a pseudo-Christian cult known as the International Churches of Christ at age 16. The ICOC was run by a man named Kip McKean, and is not affiliated with the mainline Church of Christ. Rachel has memories of the Boston Movement from the 80\u0027s, when she attended Boston University.  Passing up scholarships and other big dreams, Stacey became a leader in their Nairobi, Kenya and Cleveland, Ohio branches. Emotional and psychological control in this group orchestrated friendships and marriages, alienation from family, financial exploitation, and loss of individual identity. When she started a family with her husband, Stacey realized she was expected to use many strict techniques on her children (withholding food, ignoring their cries, and physical discipline). With the discovery of an international outcry from its members describing years of abuse, Stacey chose to start making her own decisions.   Stay tuned, Before You Go: Rachel highlights some signs of dangerous control, and then sends a shout out to someone working hard to end a group\u0027s hold on him.

Passing up their guilt, Claudine and her husband uncovered original documents and their church\u0027s history.  Rachel helps Claudine unpack this and other techniques including attributing critical thinking to sin or negative energy. The church has also made several changes to homophobic policies and demanding practices to accommodate its members, which the two discuss. Ultimately Claudine\u0027s family chose to leave the Latter Day Saints feeling that there was a lack of transparency and intense social pressures built into their testimonies.  Stay tuned, Before You Go: The FLDS, or Former Latter Day Saints, are a cultic offshoot of Mormonism made popular by Warren Jeffs.

      "description": "After her grandmother passed away, Claudine found peace in her new reality through her faith in Mormonism. Her oldest son, Ian, didn\u0027t find the same comfort and began distancing himself from her. When Claudine finally got him to open up, the two went on a journey to better understand their doctrine.  Active in the church for 27 years after growing up without associating with a denomination, the sudden loss left Claudine searching for answers. She attended a Mormon funeral and later when missionaries came to her door, she related to the way they processed loss.   Claudine\u0027s faith was put to the ultimate test when Ian became depressed. Together they began researching areas of the church\u0027s history that they had not fully examined before. Eventually they left Mormonism over several contradictory \u0022translation issues\u0022 and discrepancies between the teachings on polygamy and the way that it was practiced.

The long term effects of betrayal trauma are discussed, as well as how to empower yourself to fully see the reality of your situation.

Brie is a writer widely published and interviewed, with significant roles in many notable religious, public and governmental institutions, and she is the Director of the Safe Communities Institute at USC.  Her work includes studying how people use their beliefs to make decisions. Commenting on the productivity of the political environment, Brie addresses how perfectionism has prevented progress. And that a lack of empathy for the \u0022other\u0022 or cancellation of someone who doesn\u0027t meet personal ideals is a narcissistic outlook.   Stay tuned, Before You Go: Rachel talks about Brie\u0027s quote \u0022The biggest force against us is our own indifference\u0022. And she also explains \u0027compassion fatigue\u0027 and becoming overwhelmed by the feeling that you are unable to make a difference.

But in Scientology and other groups like it, those who express sadness, grief, or doubt are labeled as strictly negative or troubled and treated as outliers for unsuccessfully suppressing their natural emotions.  April  returns for part two of her episode; opening up about her brother who is still living in a fog of Scientology, as well as her own experience with suicidal thoughts while in the group. When she began to reveal that she was unhappy in the group, instead of receiving help or compassion she was ostracized from her friends and group settings to the point of being kicked out. The Sea Organization prevents the young members in its guardianship from seeking outside help. Psychiatry, therapy, and medication are heavily demonized in this realm where many are in need of more information and support rather than mistreatment and interrogation.",

After receiving large amounts of both positive and negative comments, the two respond to the backlash of their first episode (link below) by pointing out that this is precisely how a majority can continue to remain indoctrinated.  Using South Africa\u0027s apartheid as his personal example, Chanon opened up a few weeks ago and challenged listeners to examine their own biases and behavior. Challenging thoughts by nature are not easy to accept, and are easily confused as a threat. He believes indoctrinated prejudice is a force that must be conquered in order to fully hold ourselves accountable; breaking and ending biased views instead of allowing them to manifest a new form.
