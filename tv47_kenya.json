      "description": "As Kenya continues to mourn the Shakahola tragedy, another suspected cult has been uncovered this time in Rongo Town, Migori County. Two people died and 57 others, including children, were rescued from disturbing conditions in Melkio St. Joseph Missions of Messaiha Afrika Church .\n\nIn this urgent and revealing interview, Rev. Charles Moses Isaboke sheds light on the rise of cults in Kenya, how they manipulate faith, and what the Church, government, and citizens must do to fight back. The exploitation must end\u2014and it starts with awareness, action, and protection for the most vulnerable.",
