      "description": "Brittany Page discusses the discovery of famous guru Deepak Chopra\u0027s extensive communications with Jeffrey Epstein, in which Chopra refers to \u0022cute girls\u0022 and the \u0022noises\u0022 they make, and seems totally unconcerned with litigation involving Epstein and Trump following allegations of abuse of children. Deepak Chopra has made a career out of claiming to offer people a pathway to transcendence, healing, and the divine, but his extensive communications and relationship with Epstein reveal not only his depravity and hypocrisy but also the dangers of allowing a man like this to continue to enjoy the massive platform he does. \n\nSearch the Epstein Files yourself: https://www.justice.gov/epstein\n\nFollow my new Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/ThePagePerspective \n\nJoin this channel to get access to the perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4Kn9IrfDqDyeSp_4F1ag2Q/join\n\nSubscribe to my podcast, \u0022I Doubt It,\u0022 on Apple Podcasts or Spotify!\n\n#PagePerspective #DeepakChopra #JeffreyEpstein\n\nHow to Support:\nPayPal: https://www.dollemore.com/paypal\nMerch: https://www.dollemore.info\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/idoubtitpodcast\n\nConnect:\nBluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/brittanyepage.bsky.social\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@brittanyepage\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/brittanyepage\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/IDoubtItPodcast\n\nExplore the Team:\nJesse Dollemore on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/dollemore\nJesse Dollemore on Bluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/dollemore.com \nJesse Dollemore on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dollemore\nJesse Dollemore on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dollemore\n\nSources:\n\n- https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/world/europe/peter-mandelson-uk-epstein.html \n\n- https://www.bbc.com/news/live/czx3lq460n6t \n\n- https://apnews.com/article/france-x-investigation-seach-elon-musk-1116be84d84201011219086ecfd4e0bc \n\n- https://www.instagram.com/deepakchopra/ \n\n- https://www.instagram.com/cyberhumanai/ \n\n- https://www.facebook.com/DeepakChopra\n\n- https://www.facebook.com/ThePagePerspective/posts/pfbid0Fxd19hw3LTJRhgCTwygfhUy3EqSG3D5gJ8EibTm3kAmDndkZUP7gHtXydiyw4xHCl \n\n- https://www.deepakchopra.com/customer-support \n\n- https://www.instagram.com/p/DUOKtw2Ahqp/ \n\n- https://time.com/7317646/kash-patel-jeffrey-epstein-files/",
