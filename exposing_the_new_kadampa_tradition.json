I personally don\u0027t quite get the NKT\u0027s obsession with temples, but the question, in any case, arises: do temples help people actually find the buddhadharma to the extent that they\u0027re worth all the money and sacrifice of private individuals, and if they are, how come Buddha Shakyamuni didn\u0027t build them? Or is it more about the NKT\u0027s megalomania and narcissistic hunger of power and exhibitionism?   The link to the Money Book is here  \uD83D\uDC49https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1AmW8ZmZnE/",

Through repetition, these words and phrases ingrain an intense emotional association in the group members\u0027 psyche and shut down arguments and critical thinking to the extent that, after a period of time,  the cult member ends up brainwashing themself.",

Leadership that is authoritarian and not open to questions or criticism.\n4. Belief that the group is the only path to salvation, enlightenment, etc.\n5. Use of mind-control techniques such as manipulation, gaslighting, or coercion.\n\nSigns that may come later and indicate you are in a cult include:\n\n1. Feeling dependent on the group for your identity and sense of self-worth.\n2. Experiencing fear or anxiety about leaving the group or questioning its beliefs.\n3. Witnessing or experiencing abuse within the group that is justified or ignored by leaders.\n4. Observing a pattern of broken promises or failed prophecies by the group leaders.\n5. Realizing that critical thinking and individuality are discouraged or punished within the group. \n\nIf you have concerns about a particular group or organization you are involved with, it is important to reach out to trusted friends, family members, or mental health professionals for support and guidance.",

      "description": "Neil Elliot aka Gen Thubten described pretty well the process by which the NKT hooks new members in, it is what is known as #lovebombing, ie  showering unconditional and instant love and affection on the new member. Very few people can sta unaffected by love bombing, almost everyone is susceptible, some more,  others less. But the honeymoon won\u0027t last long and serves to manipulate individuals into developing attachment,  loyalty and servitude to the group.",
