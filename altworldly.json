      "description": "jake and Kristyna continue making fun of the bizarre Jehovah\u2019s Witness \u201Cdrama\u201D: Remember the Wife of Lot. \r\n\r\nNow, I know what you\u2019re thinking. \u201CIt\u2019d be real nice if there was a link to our stream about Part 1 in the description.\u201D Hell, even if you\u2019ve seen it a million times you\u2019re undoubtedly going to want to go back and relive the glory after seeing the majesty that was part 2! I\u2019m assuming. I\u2019m writing this the night before the stream. That\u2019s sort of the problem, though, if you could call it a problem. And really, if it\u2019s anyone\u2019s problem it\u2019s yours. See, it\u2019s late and I\u2019m stoned and can\u2019t bring myself to open another tab on my browser, pull up my videos, find the link, paste it in here\u2014which doesn\u2019t look like that many steps when I lay it out on the page, but it feels like a lot right now, okay? You might think, in all the time it took me to write this sleepy attempt at one of those annoying \u201Cthe joke is it goes on for way too long\u201D bits, I probably could have found the link to Part 1. Absolutely that would have been faster, yes. But you would have missed out on a valuable lesson: nobody reads the video description. Ever. I always post my email in the description of every video. Every upload\u2014well most of them, I sometimes forget, sure, okay, you got me. I\u2019m trying my best though. And what do I get? Well other than the satisfaction of creating something and sharing it with you beautiful people, I inevitably get a comment from someone asking for my email, wondering how on earth they can possibly get ahold of me, they\u2019ve exhausted all rational methods and can now only ask directly in a humble YouTube comment. Sometimes they come with a whole story about how they\u2019ve been desperately trying to reach me, scouring the internet for any trace of my email address. They beg me, please sir, where can I possibly find some way of reaching you by electronic mailular communication? They say it just like that, every time. Well, I dare say I question their diligence in finding that email address, dear reader. I really do. You\u2019re learning a little something about diligence, too. I think you\u2019ve also learned a valuable lesson about checking people\u2019s work. You clicked on the description of a video, undoubtedly to find my email and the link to Part 1 of me and Kristyna reacting to this silly cult movie. This was an understandable, even admirable instinct. Yet surely by now, Mr. Bond, you must realize that you have done precisely as I planned. While you were busy reading that distracting drivel, I uploaded the virus straight to England\u2019s orphan supply. Haha just kidding. Just a little James Bond joke there. But seriously, think of all the people out there who never click on the YouTube description. You were like those people once. Now you know\u2014there are probably millions of videos out there where somebody has done this exact same joke, and you never thought to look. I sure didn\u2019t. Whoa. I\u2019m just realizing this in real time, actually. I guess we all learned a little something today. Okay, for real, did you have any idea you\u2019d be reading something like this when you innocently clicked on the description, likely searching for a simple link to Part 1 and one measly email address, an email you could have easily found in any one of my previous video descriptions, assuming I remembered to put it there? From now on you\u2019ll wonder. \u201CDid he decide to do one of THOSE video descriptions?\u201D As if writing something like this is a decision at all, and not a compulsion, a terrible itch, but one inside your head, one that makes you want to push through your own ear just to get at it. Yes, you know about video descriptions now. It will haunt you, as it has me. And think of what the next one might say? For all you know, it could be something like \u201Chey by the way everything I said in this video was actually an ancient curse, and now you\u2019re beholden to a spell I can activate at any time with this whistle.\u201D Lmao, nah. Just kidding, I don\u2019t even own a whistle. But think if I had really done something like that. What a nice little adventure we\u2019ve all had here. Don\u2019t blab about it in the comments and ruin the fun, though. Or do, whatever, I\u2019m not your boss. \r\n\r\nemail: exjwfaq@gmail.com \r\n\r\nPatreon: www.patreon.com/altworldly\r\n\r\nWebsite: jwfaq.org\n\n00:00-07:30 New Year\u2019s Resolutions \n07:30-11:35 Part 1 Recap\n11:35-1:29:46 DA MOVIE\n1:29:46-1:31:51 Not Occult Announcement",
