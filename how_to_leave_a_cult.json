      "description": "I share a harrowing experience where my minister crossed the line, touching me inappropriately and making suggestive advances. I talk about the overwhelming guilt and shame I felt, believing it was my fault, and how this abuse affected my emotional well-being for years. What made it even harder was the fear that no one would believe me\u2014after all, he was a trusted figure. The trauma of this experience is just one piece of the bigger picture. Growing up in a cult, I was constantly navigating an environment of control, manipulation, and confusion. The shame and guilt I carried, both from this abuse and my upbringing, shaped how I viewed myself and the world for years. This episode reflects on how deep-rooted trauma can affect every aspect of life, making it incredibly difficult to shift from merely surviving to thriving. Healing from this kind of trauma isn\u2019t linear, and the emotional weight of it can feel suffocating, especially when you\u2019re left questioning your worth and struggling to break free from the lasting effects of a lifetime of control.

David and his wife initially found solace in practices like Transcendental Meditation and Rebirthing, which brought them positive experiences and a sense of peace. However, these very practices led them to the doors of the cult, where they were drawn in by charismatic leaders, Trina and Steven. David shares his emotional journey of joining the cult, leaving, and then rejoining years later, all while grappling with the influence of the ministers he once admired. When the cult\u0027s leaders turned his wife against him, David felt trapped, unable to leave as she distanced herself from him. Their situation became even more dire when one of the ministers resorted to physical abuse, prompting them to finally flee together.

I want to create a community where people who have been abused by cults or religious groups can learn and heal. I will be sharing my very personal story of being raised in a religious cult for nearly 30 years. I will also be sharing how I have healed and how you can too. You can move past the past. You deserve to not carry that kind of baggage anymore. My story will share manipulation, gaslighting, alcoholism, as well as a cult run charter school, massive lawsuits, cult experts, arranged marriage and so much more.
