      "description": "Listen to Beyond BJU HERE\nDr. Camille Lewis attended BJU in the 90s, where she earned both her bachelor\u0027s and master\u0027s degrees. She joined the faculty at BJU and completed her Ph.D. from Indiana University. In 2007, she left BJU after being given an ultimatum: either resign or permit the BJU daycare to spank her 2-year-old son. She chose her son. In this episode, she shares five facts BJU does not want you to know. \nShe is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication Studies at Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina. She holds a Ph.D. from Indiana University in Rhetorical Studies with a minor in American Studies. Her book, \u0027Romancing the Difference: Kenneth Burke, Bob Jones University, and the Rhetoric of Religious Fundamentalism\u0027, was a scholarly attempt to stretch the boundaries of both Kenneth Burke\u2019s rhetorical theory on tragedy and comedy as well as stretch conservative evangelical\u2019s separatist frames. Her second book, \u0027White Nationalism and Faith: Statements and Counter-Statements\u0027, tracks the religious arguments for and against white nationalism in America since the Civil War. She is currently working on a book entitled Klandamentalism.

Rachel Bernstein, therapist, and renowned cult expert shares her insights on Bob Jones University. She is the host of the \u201CIndoctriNation\u201D podcast which covers cults, manipulators, and systems of control. For 30 years, she has helped former cult members and those who have loved ones in cults and highly manipulative relationships. Rachel has helped people from over 300 cults throughout her career. She provides individual counseling, family counseling, and, when possible, group therapy for former cult members. She also helps families trying to reach out to their loved ones in the cult.

      "description": "TRIGGER WARNING (Suicide, Abuse)Hello, I\u2019m your host Andrew Pledger and this is \u0022Surviving Bob Jones University: A Christian Cult.\u0022I grew up in fundamentalist Christianity, specifically the Independent Fundamental Baptist cult. I was homeschooled my entire life to be indoctrinated into this environment. I was subjected to psychological, spiritual, and emotional abuse. I experienced religious trauma from abusive theology on hell, the end times, purity culture, sexuality, and human nature. As a queer person, I experienced so much trauma from their hateful and violent speech towards the LGBTQ\u002B community and also harm from authoritarian parents. Fundamentalist Christianity was my whole world and I ended up at Bob Jones University. I was at BJU for 3.5 years from 2018-2021. While at Bob Jones I struggled with my mental health from religious trauma, sexual repression, and minority stress. I was driven to the point of nearly committing suicide from my traumas in this system of control. I knew I could not get the help I needed in this environment so I searched outside the group. I was able to connect with people on the outside who would eventually get me out of this cult.\u00A0Series coming in 2023.Music Credit: https://www.purple-planet.comConnect with Andrew PledgerMental Health ResourcesNational Suicide Hotline (988)Trevor Project HotlineCDC ResourcesFind a Therapist (Psychology Today) Hosted on Acast.
