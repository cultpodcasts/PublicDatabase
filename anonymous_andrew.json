I want to explain why I am doing this research. I have reached out to several people who were in the documentary (and not) and asked them to come on my podcast and tell their story and give more insight into this cult. You will not be edited, you can speak freely. Unlike Netflix and Amazon where they have editors and producers and time constraints and a narrative, I do not! What you say will be aired, You have the stage!Please consider coming on the show and tell your story, I want to help get the word out there and if it starts with me, it will snowball to other podcasters, I want the government to do something about this. I have a free platform from which you can shout from the mountain top your disgust, your heartbreak and pleas to whomever will listen. I promise you I have no agenda other than you hep you.
