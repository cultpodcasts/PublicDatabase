      "description": "The majority of our members are storytellers, but you know I always really love our inductees who are researchers, documentarians and investigative journalists.  We are very excited to induct a new member who is one of the absolute foremost experts about a shady element of society.  The work he does cannot be overstated for its value, in both rescuing people and, like this episode, even just getting the word out and raising awareness.  He has worked closely with both the Branch Davidians and the FBI during the standoff in Waco, Texas in the \u201890s and much more recently, with survivors of the NXIVM cult.  You can check out his massive resource, the Cult Education Institute, free and open to the public, at CultEducation.com and you can pick up his comprehensive book, \u201CCults Inside Out: How People Get In and Can Get Out.\u201D  And as we induct a new member, it is a good time to point out that you are free to leave at any time, there is no punishment for leaving and I, personally, lack the charisma to be considered a charismatic leader.
