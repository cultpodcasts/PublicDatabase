      "description": "Rani Singh is a BBC reporter and former actress who found that both her sons - in their 30s - had left her for a scientology like life coaching cult (aka a very British cult) known as the Lighthouse International or Lighthouse Global. A BBC documentary that takes us inside the life coaching cult that takes over lives is being released at the same time as this episode to shed light on the cult, which has been ruining the lives of countless individuals who signed up. Rani\u0027s sons have now disowned her, refused to call her mum, and are in the thrall of the head of Lighthouse International. Her sons, under orders from and along with life-coaching cult leader, coerced Rani into raising a massive mortgage loan against her unencumbered asset that was her only security and lend him money he promised he would make sure was fully returned to her, along with interest. We talk about the similarities between the cult and Tom Cruise\u0027s Scientology, and ask her sons one thing: come home to speak to your mum.\n\nAs seen in the BBC TV and radio documentary: A Very British Cult, and in Kira\u0027s channel about the \u0022life coaching\u0022 cult and its insane leader. Lighthouse promises life coaching to help people realise their dreams. But an 18-month investigation by the BBC found it takes over people\u0027s lives, separates people from their loved ones and harasses its critics.\n\nLife coaching is a booming UK industry. There are an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 people working in the field. \n\nUnlike many therapists or counsellors most coaches generally say they focus more on clients\u0027 futures. In theory at least, they try to help people work out what they really want and how to get there.\n\nVisit the Family Survival Trust: https://www.thefamilysurvivaltrust.org\n\nChapters:\n0:00 How the cult took Rani\u2019s kids\n7:40 The most sinister part\n8:15 What Lighthouse International DO\n12:00 How the sons controlled Rani\u2019s finances\n15:40 The assurances Paul Waugh gave her\n17:40 The Love Bombing\n19:25 NXIVM \u0026 Keith Raniere Narcissist Similarities\n24:00 Rani\u2019s son contacted Andrew\n25:00 Scientology Squirrels / Fair Game\n29:30 Using shunning against Rani\n33:00 What the sect DID to Rani!

      "description": "Everything you need to know about Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses from today\u0027s guest, Lloyd Evans (The Reluctant Apostate), who tells me about his own upbringing in the JW church. (Click subscribe if you enjoy.) The YouTuber and ex-JW reveals everything about blood transfusions, domestic abuse and his own upbringing in a family of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses. Lloyd Evans from John Cedars Channel: My (former) life as a Jehovah\u0027s Witness.\n\nPlease do subscribe - it only takes a sec and is free to do - I need a larger subscriber base to be able to earn any money from the ads YouTube show! \n\nThe older episodes are available on this channel but most are just audio. This is my first time editing the video version together. Subscribe to hear the next ones - next week is a look at an ex-Mormon from the Thank God I\u0027m an Atheist podcast. It\u0027ll be available first on my audio podcast and video just for patrons (links below) then up here a month later.\n\nLinks:\n\nThe John Cedars YouTube Channel (JW Broadcasting): https://www.youtube.com/c/JohnCedars\nLloyd Evans: The Reluctant Apostate: https://www.amazon.com/dp/0995669104/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ep_dp_D7EIybP20N0C8\nAndrew Gold\u0027s brand new Patreon page: http://patreon.com/andrewgold\nAudio version of the podcast (where most people listen): https://podfollow.com/on-the-edge-with-andrew-gold\n\nSummary:\n\nLloyd Evans is pretty much the world\u2019s pre-eminent ex-Jehovah\u2019s Witness and authority on the religion, its attractions and its snares. He tells some of the downright craziest and unbelievable stories of his childhood and his time in religion.\n\nSo that Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses know, I\u2019m not just picking on them, as I\u2019ve already done episodes on an ex-Muslim whose family are trying to kill her, an ex-Hasidic Jew who believes the community raped her and the son of the founder of the Westboro Baptist Church. You\u2019ll find those in the backlog, by clicking the links above or by visiting my website, andrewgoldpodcast.com.\n\nThis is also a special podcast because Ex-Jehovah\u0027s Witness Lloyd Evans convinced me, as you\u2019ll hear, of the merits of starting my own Patreon page, and he\u2019s even started contributing himself, which is a really touching gesture from a fellow content maker. Bringing this podcast to you every week is a full-time job, it takes about 40 hours each week. Just go to patreon.com/andrewgold.\n\nOf course, if I\u2019m going to be making money from this, I also have to up my game. I\u2019ve been making an effort to ensure interviewees send me their audio files \u2013 so you\u2019ll hear in this one, Lloyd\u2019s voice is absolutely gorgeous. And I\u2019m going to start publishing the video versions of the podcast on YouTube, with lots of flashy camera angles and high definition.\n\nAnyway, that was my announcement and I don\u2019t want it to eat into any more Lloyd Evans ex-Jehovah\u2019s Witness time. We\u2019re going to be talking about everything from the community\u2019s controversial views on blood transfusions to its purported inaction on child abuse. Lloyd talks eloquently about cognitive dissonance \u2013 the way our mind refuses to consider reasoning that runs counter to our engrained idea of how the world works. Lloyd really is an authority on the subject, and if you want to know more, I encourage you to get hold of his acclaimed book \u2013 The Reluctant Apostate \u2013 and to visit his popular YouTube page with over 70,000 subscriptions, the John Cedars channel.",

      "description": "Sadia Hameed talks on On the Edge with Andrew Gold podcast about how an interpreter told her parents they should abduct her before she gets too old for them to be able to. She was taken to Pakistan, where she was abused and tortured. \n\nA spokesperson for the Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain. Having grown up in England, Sadia was tricked in her teens into moving to Pakistan, where she was abused, starved and tortured, while her family out there tried to work out whether she had slept with a white man.\n\nJoin us at 7pm on Thursday March 11th 2021 here (it\u0027s free, and you don\u0027t have to sign up): https://discord.gg/RWH7fs6ygb\n\nToday, I\u2019m speaking with Sadia Hameed, a spokesperson for the Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain who has a quite remarkable story to tell. She holds some strong and damning views, and has a knack for getting them across in a way that is both persuasive and, often, comical. Having grown up in England, Sadia was tricked in her teens into moving to Pakistan, where she was abused, starved and tortured, while her family out there tried to work out whether she had slept with a white man.\n\nSadia Links\n\nhttps://twitter.com/sadia936\nhttp://instagram.com/sadia936\nFour Freedoms YouTube\n\nAndrew Links\n\nhttp://youtube.com/andrewgold1\nhttp://instagram.com/andrewgold_ok\nhttp://twitter.com/andrewgold_ok\nhttp://patreon.com/andrewgold\nhttp://andrewgoldpodcast.com\n\nSadia isn\u2019t just the sum of her experiences. She\u2019s also outspoken on issues such as women\u2019s rights and human rights, while, as you might expect, damning of religious extremism, with a particular focus on Islam. She can\u2019t talk too much about the work she does, but it involves domestic abuse that is often hidden in religion\u2019s guise of righteousness. She talks about what it was actually like to be so hungry that she thought she might die, and gives us an insight into the last few decades in the history of the UK\u2019s south Asian immigration. It appears that what angers her more than anything is a recurring theme on this podcast - the refusal of social justice warriors to look in some of the most obvious places. \n\nLike Yasmine Mohammed, who was on the podcast a few weeks ago, Sadia shakes with rage at so-called progressives who appear to move heaven and earth to help a young white girl in trouble; but who think it\u2019s fine for a young brown girl to be tortured, raped and forced to marry. Most shockingly, she tells of a social services translator who actually warned her parents they should lock her up and send her away before she\u2019s of age.\n \nWe got on so well in fact, that we ended up speaking for hours. So, I\u2019ve done something I\u2019ve never done on the show which is to split this into two parts, this being the first. And the bonus content for Patrons will be at the end of the second one, which will come out in a couple of weeks.",

      "description": "Nate Phelps is the son of the Westboro Baptist Church founder Fred \u0027Gramps\u0027 Phelps - a homophobic religious cult known as America\u0027s Most Hated Family. Brother of Shirley Phelps and son of Fred \u0027Gramps\u0027 Phelps, Nate is now an LGBT advocate and defector from the Westboro Baptist Church sect from Topeka, Kansas. The cult, which is also known as America\u0027s Most Hated Family, became infamous in the 1990s for its campaigns in which they\u0027d picket funerals of military personnel as a bizarre and illogical protest against homosexuality. And now, with more church members defecting, we\u0027re approaching the baptist church death.\n\nTheir signs at the pickets usually claimed that \u0027god hates f***\u0027 (a homophobic slur), but also took aim at such celebrities as Princess Diana and Louis Theroux, who made three BBC documentaries about the Kansas-based cult. \n\nNate was indoctrinated with the church\u2019s homophobic philosophy and made to listen to his father\u2019s preaching from the moment he left the womb. After doubts began to rise in his mind, he escaped his father\u2019s church at midnight on his 18th birthday in a terrifying account you\u2019ll hear him relay. He was left to fend for himself, confused, scared and alone, his mind still consumed by the teachings of his abusive cult leader of a father. This led him to do some bad things, once out of the church, which he discusses openly. He now speaks as a public advocate of LGBT rights and is a prominent member of the hub of secular thought, the Center for Inquiry.\n\nHe discusses his meeting with Louis Theroux, the brutal abuse with a medieval instrument at the hands of his tyrannical father and the intelligence, wit and humour of his sister and mouthpiece for the church, Shirley. He tells me what really went down with his supposedly repentant dad and the LGBT Rainbow House across the street from the church, and he reveals what he tells his children about the church he grew up in. \n\n#cults #westboro #louistheroux",

I planned this episode to appear now, as I saw it\u2019s International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation on February 6th, and it\u2019s something I wanted learn about. I\u2019d often heard about FGM but didn\u2019t actually know all that much about it. Was it a religious custom or a cultural tradition, or simply a barbaric act carried out on girls by some patriarchal groups. It appears to be the latter.\n\n\nNimko Links:\n\nBook - What we\u0027re told not to talk about: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rude-There-Such-Thing-Over-Sharing/dp/024129262X\nFive Foundation: https://www.thefivefoundation.org/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/NimkoAli\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/nimkoali/\n\nAndrew Links:\n\nPatreon.com/andrewgold\ntwitter.com/andrewgold_ok\ninstagram.com/andrewgold_ok\nfacebook.com/ontheedgewithandrewgold\n\nIn any case, Nimko is of Somali heritage and was herself cut as a child. She is the co-founder of the Five Foundation, so make sure to get on there and donate, share and support however you can to help to end FGM. She also has a prestigious OBE, was named in the BBC\u2019s 100 Women, won Red Magazine\u2019s Woman of the Year and won the International Women\u2019s Rights Award at the Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy. I read and loved her book What We\u2019re Told Not To Talk About \u2013 link in the show notes. Split into categories labelled periods, orgasms, pregnancy and menopause, it collects haunting and inspirational stories from women around the world. It goes into intense and surprisingly vivid, or disgusting, detail, which is one of the book\u2019s strengths, it\u2019s a lot of fun to read and I found myself both laughing and crying.\n\n\nWe discuss what it was like for Nimko to be cut, and how it affects her life today. And although this is a very serious topic, Nimko is able to talk at times with humour. So, we delve into her previous fancy for English football player Michael Owen and her current interest in Conservative politician Jacob Rees-Mogg, who is a bit of a dark horse to say the least. If you get to the end, Nimko tells the men listening how they can get in touch with her to ask her on a date, because she hasn\u2019t been with someone seriously for five years.",

      "description": "Kelly Thiel was once a member of the notorious NXIVM cult. For those of you who \u2013 like me \u2013 don\u2019t or didn\u2019t know much about this sect, you\u2019re in for a bit of a shock \u2013 not least in how that bunch of capital letters are supposed to be pronounced. But I\u2019ll let Kelly explain that part.    The cult was on the surface a multi-level marketing group that had various levels of memberships. Its members would learn a lot about self-help stuff, such as how to find purpose and be happy. Its methods were said to have been somewhere between those of Tony Robbins and the cult of Scientology, and there was even some stuff about going back to your childhood or past lives.
