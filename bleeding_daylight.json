      "description": "Les Watson has worked extensively throughout Australia and South East Asia, helping people claim back time. He says that he can help us all gain back an hour a day. Thanks to his expertise in time management, Les has earned the nickname \u201CTime Lord\u201D. On Bleeding Daylight, we touch on some of those skills, but we also spend time exploring how he exited a controlling cult and walked into freedom.\n\n\n\n\u00A0\n\n\n\n\u00A0\n\n\n\nWEBLINKS\n\nGet More Time Website (https://www.getmoretime.com.au/) \n\nLes Watson on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/les-watson) \n\nLes Watson Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/les.watson.79) \n\nLes Watson Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/timelordles)",
