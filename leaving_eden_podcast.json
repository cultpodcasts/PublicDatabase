The ex-wife of megachurch pastor and author of \u0022I Kissed Dating Goodbye\u0022 Joshua Harris, Shannon was not born into evangelicalism, but was pulled in as a young adult. Shannon tells of giving up more and more of her identity in service to her husband\u0027s ministry, and how deconstruction led the two of them down different paths. We highly recommend this book. We agree that it is an excellent deconstruction memoir.

TW: In general we talk about a lot of potentially triggering topics on this show, including but not limited to suicide and mental health, racism, misogyny, PTSD and PTSD symptoms, child abuse, mental, physical, and sexual abuse, and spiritual abuse including guilt, shame, and fear.

Additional TW for literally everything, this dude was a bad guy and did a lot of terrible stuff. Imagine if we were talking about a 1920s mobster and you\u0027ve got the gist of it.

TW: In general we talk about a lot of potentially triggering topics on this show, including but not limited to suicide and mental health, racism, misogyny, PTSD and PTSD symptoms, child abuse, mental, physical, and sexual abuse, and spiritual abuse including guilt, shame, and fear.

This episode contains a huge trigger warning for eating disorders, and we will be talking about numbers, like people\u2019s weight, or calorie numbers, macro counting. Usually I avoid any number talk because it\u2019s a bit of a trigger even for me personally, but it is really necessary to this episode. What I won\u2019t do in this episode, because I never ever do and never will, is discuss other eating disorder behavior beyond just saying extreme calorie restriction; I don\u2019t ever discuss the methods that people use to achieve that kind of restriction because I\u2019ve found that\u2019s always damaging to me, so I feel there\u2019s a high chance it\u2019s damaging to other people too. If you need to skip *all* the fitness influencer, eating disorder stuff, you can jump back in after the break at 43 minutes, where we will be moving on to other scams and grifts and general BS that this person has been involved in. There are also much briefer mentions of police brutality, animal cruelty, and suicide in this episode.

Alberto Rivera alleges a large-scale global conspiracy theory in which the Roman Catholic Church seeks world domination. Turns out, just like everything else in Rivera\u0027s life, his conspiracy allegations are stolen. Find out from where on today\u0027s episode!

This episode contains mention of self-harm and suicidal ideation \u2013 as always we\u2019ll try to be as clinical and respectful as possible when discussing this, and I will give you a heads-up before we get there. This episode will also contain discussion of historical sexual abuse in the church, and a large amount of racist or zenophobic antisemitic and/or Islamophobic conspiracy theories. I also want to recognize, any time we talk about the Catholic Church we have to give recognition to the crimes against humanity committed in residential schools. Those are not the topic of our discussion for today, so if that\u2019s a trigger for anyone, we won\u2019t be getting into it in detail. This episode is NOT \u201CThe church has never done any crimes\u201D it is simply \u201CThe church has not done THESE PARTICULAR crimes because THIS PARTICULAR person is a liar.\u201D This episode is also not meant to be a defense of Catholic theology and doctrine and tradition as *correct* or what *you* should believe, but rather we\u2019re trying to show how it has been misrepresented in order for Chick to fearmonger.

Elizabeth is the author of the book \u0022Through Gates of Splendor,\u0022 which chronicled her husband\u0027s death during an ill-advised missions trip to spread christian colonialism in Ecuador. Elizabeth\u0027s later writings were instrumental in the advent of purity culture throughout christian evangelicalism. Subsequent examinations of Jim\u0027s journals and Elizabeth\u0027s personal writings, however, suggest that there is a sadder story, and lead us to as the question, is purity culture just internalized homophobia and repressed sexuality?

Together with Shoshana, they examine how truly horrible and harmful this book is, and what healing from this sort of upbringing might look like. TW: In general we talk about a lot of potentially triggering topics on this show, including but not limited to suicide and mental health, racism, misogyny, PTSD and PTSD symptoms, child abuse, mental, physical, and sexual abuse, and spiritual abuse including guilt, shame, and fear. In most episodes we\u2019ll mention at least a few of these topics, but we try very hard to avoid graphic detail unless it\u2019s relevant to the story we\u2019re telling, and we do our best to give the audience a heads-up before going into detail on any of these topics. This Entire Episode carries a trigger warning for child abuse, specifically, hitting, spanking, hitting with implements, what implements are recommended to hit your child, how to break a child\u2019s spirit. We will of course be validating survivors of such abuse, talking scientifically about why it\u2019s not okay, trying to use language that\u2019s less triggering, but it is the topic of the episode. We will also more briefly mention topics such as complimentarianism, wives submitting to husbands, marital rape, and briefly mention the deaths of several children which were related to the teachings put forth in this book.

In what is quite possibly Leaving Eden Podcast\u0027s most requested episode ever, Sadie and Gavi discuss Jonestown, The People\u2019s Temple, and the massacre that occurred there in November of 1978. TW: In general we talk about a lot of potentially triggering topics on this show, including but not limited to suicide and mental health, racism, misogyny, PTSD and PTSD symptoms, child abuse, mental, physical, and sexual abuse, and spiritual abuse including guilt, shame, and fear. In most episodes we\u2019ll mention at least a few of these topics, but we try very hard to avoid graphic detail unless it\u2019s relevant to the story we\u2019re telling, and we do our best to give the audience a heads-up before going into detail on any of these topics. In this episode, of course we are going to be discussing many deaths by suicide, the majority of which were coerced or forced, and the death of many children, but we think that\u2019s obvious from the episode title and the topic we\u2019re discussing. We are also going to be talking about a lot of very twisted humiliation rituals, control and brainwashing and blackmail rituals, this goes a bit deeper than we were initially aware of. Of course we will give you a heads up before we drop any graphic details, but as usual we are going to err on the side of not glorifying abuse and letting listeners seek out the darker details if they want to. Additionally, you may be confused by or disagree with our portrayals of The People\u2019s Temple, Jim Jones, and his followers.

      "description": "In what is quite possibly Leaving Eden Podcast\u0027s most requested episode ever, Sadie and Gavi discuss Jonestown, The People\u2019s Temple, and the massacre that occurred there in November of 1978.TW: In general we talk about a lot of potentially triggering topics on this show, including but not limited to suicide and mental health, racism, misogyny, PTSD and PTSD symptoms, child abuse, mental, physical, and sexual abuse, and spiritual abuse including guilt, shame, and fear. In most episodes we\u2019ll mention at least a few of these topics, but we try very hard to avoid graphic detail unless it\u2019s relevant to the story we\u2019re telling, and we do our best to give the audience a heads-up before going into detail on any of these topics. In this episode, of course we are going to be discussing many deaths by suicide, the majority of which were coerced or forced, and the death of many children, but we think that\u2019s obvious from the episode title and the topic we\u2019re discussing. We are also going to be talking about a lot of very twisted humiliation rituals, control and brainwashing and blackmail rituals, this goes a bit deeper than we were initially aware of. Of course we will give you a heads up before we drop any graphic details, but as usual we are going to err on the side of not glorifying abuse and letting listeners seek out the darker details if they want to. Additionally, you may be confused by or disagree with our portrayals of The People\u2019s Temple, Jim Jones, and his followers. While obviously Jim Jones was a murderer and a controlling and abusive person, it is important to explore his positive attributes in order to explain what his followers saw in him and why they trusted him to begin with. To not do so would be to portray them as witless sheep led to slaughter which would be against the mission of this podcast and also disrespectful to the memories of those who died in 1978 as a result of the actions of Jim Jones.An extended, uncensored, and ad-free version of this podcast episode is available to subscribers at Patreon.com/LeavingEdenPodcastWE HAVE NEW MERCH AVAILABLE, AND A NEW MERCH SHOP, at https://leavingedenpodcast.threadless.comStream the Leaving Eden Podcast theme song, Rolling River of Time on Spotify!https://open.spotify.com/artist/6lB7RwSQ9X5gnt1BDNugyS?si=jVhmqFfYRSiruRxekdLgKA.Join our Facebook Discussion group!https://www.facebook.com/groups/edenexodusJoin our subreddit!Reddit.com/r/EdenExodusInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/leavingedenpodcast/https://www.instagram.com/sadiecarpentermusic/https://www.instagram.com/gavrielhacohen/Twitter:https://twitter.com/LeavingEdenPodhttps://twitter.com/HellYeahSadiehttps://twitter.com/GavrielHacohenFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/LeavingEdenPodcasthttps://www.facebook.com/GavrielHaCohen--- Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/leavingedenpodcast/messageSupport this podcast: https://anchor.fm/leavingedenpodcast/support Get bonus content on Patreon Hosted on Acast.

Sadie and Gavi revisit the mystery of Paul Sand (Episode 26), a \u0022true\u0022 story put forward by Jack Hyles in his famous sermon, \u0022Duty.\u0022 A tip from listener Casey Atkins (Thank you Casey!) points them in the direction of the 1964 murder of Agnes Farris, at the hand of her husband, Edward Wayne Farris. Certain details are too consistent to be coincidence. Other details are irreconcilable with the story told by Hyles. Is this the murder from the sermon? And what does this say about the man who delivered the sermon? Sadie and Gavi are on the case! This episode is brought to you by our sponsor, BetterHelp!

This episode will talk about all types of child abuse extensively, although as always we will pick and choose which details we share and give you a heads up before we talk about anything exceptionally bad. But this is a blanket warning for the WHOLE episode, we will not be able to CW before every mention of child abuse because it is the whole episode.This episode is sponsored by BetterHelp.

We don\u2019t have any reason to go into great detail about his crime on this episode, but the general topic of sexual assault of a minor and sex trafficking will be throughout the episode. He also, spoiler alert, is not yet registered with the national sex offender registry, and this is something that gives some people anxiety, especially those of us who knew him, so if that\u2019s a trigger for you, be aware that it is the topic of this episode.WE HAVE NEW MERCH AVAILABLE, AND A NEW MERCH SHOP, at https://leavingedenpodcast.threadless.comStream the Leaving Eden Podcast theme song, Rolling River of Time on Spotify! https://open.spotify.com/artist/6lB7RwSQ9X5gnt1BDNugyS?si=jVhmqFfYRSiruRxekdLgKA.Join our Facebook Discussion group! https://www.facebook.com/groups/edenexodusJoin our subreddit!

      "description": "Sadie and Gavri\u0027el continue their two-part series on Satan and Satanism by exploring how the satanic panic has influenced mass hysteria phenomena today, including QAnon. They debunk several foundational claims made in support of the satanic panic, and then they explore major influential movements in modern satanism, including Aleister Crowly and Thelema, The Church of Satan, and The Satanic Temple. To finish it off, they play a game of \u0022grifter or true believer\u0022 to determine who really believes what they are saying and who is just in it for the money.
