We also read a letter from a listener who attended \u0022Day One,\u0022 a large youth conference put on by Ron Luce\u0027s ministries in 1999. This event was historically significant because it coincided with the Columbine shootings, and was a catalyst for the prevalence of teenage martyrdom messaging within evangelical youth culture.

Shannon tells of giving up more and more of her identity in service to her husband\u0027s ministry, and how deconstruction led the two of them down different paths. We highly recommend this book.

This episode contains a huge trigger warning for eating disorders, and we will be talking about numbers, like people\u2019s weight, or calorie numbers, macro counting. Usually I avoid any number talk because it\u2019s a bit of a trigger even for me personally, but it is really necessary to this episode. What I won\u2019t do in this episode, because I never ever do and never will, is discuss other eating disorder behavior beyond just saying extreme calorie restriction; I don\u2019t ever discuss the methods that people use to achieve that kind of restriction because I\u2019ve found that\u2019s always damaging to me, so I feel there\u2019s a high chance it\u2019s damaging to other people too. If you need to skip *all* the fitness influencer, eating disorder stuff, you can jump back in after the break at 43 minutes, where we will be moving on to other scams and grifts and general BS that this person has been involved in.

Alberto Rivera alleges a large-scale global conspiracy theory in which the Roman Catholic Church seeks world domination. Turns out, just like everything else in Rivera\u0027s life, his conspiracy allegations are stolen. Find out from where on today\u0027s episode! Tune in next week for discussion of banned children\u0027s toys in fundamentalism! TW: In general we talk about a lot of potentially triggering topics on this show, including but not limited to suicide and mental health, racism, misogyny, PTSD and PTSD symptoms, child abuse, mental, physical, and sexual abuse, and spiritual abuse including guilt, shame, and fear. In most episodes we\u2019ll mention at least a few of these topics, but we try very hard to avoid graphic detail unless it\u2019s relevant to the story we\u2019re telling, and we do our best to give the audience a heads-up before going into detail on any of these topics. This episode contains mention of self-harm and suicidal ideation \u2013 as always we\u2019ll try to be as clinical and respectful as possible when discussing this, and I will give you a heads-up before we get there. This episode will also contain discussion of historical sexual abuse in the church, and a large amount of racist or zenophobic antisemitic and/or Islamophobic conspiracy theories. I also want to recognize, any time we talk about the Catholic Church we have to give recognition to the crimes against humanity committed in residential schools. Those are not the topic of our discussion for today, so if that\u2019s a trigger for anyone, we won\u2019t be getting into it in detail. This episode is NOT \u201CThe church has never done any crimes\u201D it is simply \u201CThe church has not done THESE PARTICULAR crimes because THIS PARTICULAR person is a liar.\u201D This episode is also not meant to be a defense of Catholic theology and doctrine and tradition as *correct* or what *you* should believe, but rather we\u2019re trying to show how it has been misrepresented in order for Chick to fearmonger.

There\u2019s also some generalized misogyny, victim blaming of ex-wives, and Ruckman describes two different suicide attempts very callously. We won\u2019t read his exact words to attempt to mitigate harm for listeners.

In this episode we\u2019re going to be discussing a ton of misogyny, just all of the kinds and shapes of misogyny, but we\u2019ll also likely mention mass shootings, individual violence against women, and sex trafficking.

In what is quite possibly Leaving Eden Podcast\u0027s most requested episode ever, Sadie and Gavi discuss Jonestown, The People\u2019s Temple, and the massacre that occurred there in November of 1978. TW: In general we talk about a lot of potentially triggering topics on this show, including but not limited to suicide and mental health, racism, misogyny, PTSD and PTSD symptoms, child abuse, mental, physical, and sexual abuse, and spiritual abuse including guilt, shame, and fear. In most episodes we\u2019ll mention at least a few of these topics, but we try very hard to avoid graphic detail unless it\u2019s relevant to the story we\u2019re telling, and we do our best to give the audience a heads-up before going into detail on any of these topics. In this episode, of course we are going to be discussing many deaths by suicide, the majority of which were coerced or forced, and the death of many children, but we think that\u2019s obvious from the episode title and the topic we\u2019re discussing. We are also going to be talking about a lot of very twisted humiliation rituals, control and brainwashing and blackmail rituals, this goes a bit deeper than we were initially aware of. Of course we will give you a heads up before we drop any graphic details, but as usual we are going to err on the side of not glorifying abuse and letting listeners seek out the darker details if they want to. Additionally, you may be confused by or disagree with our portrayals of The People\u2019s Temple, Jim Jones, and his followers. While obviously Jim Jones was a murderer and a controlling and abusive person, it is important to explore his positive attributes in order to explain what his followers saw in him and why they trusted him to begin with. To not do so would be to portray them as witless sheep led to slaughter which would be against the mission of this podcast and also disrespectful to the memories of those who died in 1978 as a result of the actions of Jim Jones.

      "description": "In what is quite possibly Leaving Eden Podcast\u0027s most requested episode ever, Sadie and Gavi discuss Jonestown, The People\u2019s Temple, and the massacre that occurred there in November of 1978.TW: In general we talk about a lot of potentially triggering topics on this show, including but not limited to suicide and mental health, racism, misogyny, PTSD and PTSD symptoms, child abuse, mental, physical, and sexual abuse, and spiritual abuse including guilt, shame, and fear. In most episodes we\u2019ll mention at least a few of these topics, but we try very hard to avoid graphic detail unless it\u2019s relevant to the story we\u2019re telling, and we do our best to give the audience a heads-up before going into detail on any of these topics. In this episode, of course we are going to be discussing many deaths by suicide, the majority of which were coerced or forced, and the death of many children, but we think that\u2019s obvious from the episode title and the topic we\u2019re discussing. We are also going to be talking about a lot of very twisted humiliation rituals, control and brainwashing and blackmail rituals, this goes a bit deeper than we were initially aware of. Of course we will give you a heads up before we drop any graphic details, but as usual we are going to err on the side of not glorifying abuse and letting listeners seek out the darker details if they want to. Additionally, you may be confused by or disagree with our portrayals of The People\u2019s Temple, Jim Jones, and his followers. While obviously Jim Jones was a murderer and a controlling and abusive person, it is important to explore his positive attributes in order to explain what his followers saw in him and why they trusted him to begin with. To not do so would be to portray them as witless sheep led to slaughter which would be against the mission of this podcast and also disrespectful to the memories of those who died in 1978 as a result of the actions of Jim Jones.An extended, uncensored, and ad-free version of this podcast episode is available to subscribers at Patreon.com/LeavingEdenPodcastWE HAVE NEW MERCH AVAILABLE, AND A NEW MERCH SHOP, at https://leavingedenpodcast.threadless.comStream the Leaving Eden Podcast theme song, Rolling River of Time on Spotify!https://open.spotify.com/artist/6lB7RwSQ9X5gnt1BDNugyS?si=jVhmqFfYRSiruRxekdLgKA.Join our Facebook Discussion group!https://www.facebook.com/groups/edenexodusJoin our subreddit!Reddit.com/r/EdenExodusInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/leavingedenpodcast/https://www.instagram.com/sadiecarpentermusic/https://www.instagram.com/gavrielhacohen/Twitter:https://twitter.com/LeavingEdenPodhttps://twitter.com/HellYeahSadiehttps://twitter.com/GavrielHacohenFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/LeavingEdenPodcasthttps://www.facebook.com/GavrielHaCohen--- Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/leavingedenpodcast/messageSupport this podcast: https://anchor.fm/leavingedenpodcast/support Get bonus content on Patreon Hosted on Acast.

Certain details are too consistent to be coincidence. Other details are irreconcilable with the story told by Hyles. Is this the murder from the sermon?

This episode will talk about all types of child abuse extensively, although as always we will pick and choose which details we share and give you a heads up before we talk about anything exceptionally bad. But this is a blanket warning for the WHOLE episode, we will not be able to CW before every mention of child abuse because it is the whole episode.This episode is sponsored by BetterHelp.
