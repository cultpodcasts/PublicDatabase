      "title": "SUNN Speakers at Rajneeshpuram: My Teacher\u0027s Cult Sound Gig",
      "description": "Quick story about the time my audio engineering teacher rented out SUNN speakers to the Rajneeshpuram cult compound in Oregon.\n\nFor those who don\u0027t know: Rajneeshpuram was a cult community in rural Oregon in the 1980s led by Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. They threw massive parties and events. They also poisoned people, attempted murder, and committed the largest bioterror attack in US history.\n\nMy teacher did live sound work in Oregon and at one point rented SUNN speakers to them for their events before everyone knew how dangerous they actually were.\n\nJust a weird piece of Oregon music history that connects to the SUNN amp conversation. Sometimes gear ends up in strange places.\n\nIf you want the full Rajneeshpuram story, there\u0027s a great documentary called \u0022Wild Wild Country\u0022 on Netflix.\n\nTHE LOST STATE SHOW\nWeekly videos covering music industry news, gear stories, and commentary.
