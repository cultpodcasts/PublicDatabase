      "description": "Never before have I met someone who wants to live life to the full like Claire Ashman.\n\nIt all makes sense when you discover that she is a cult survivor, of not one but two cults in Australia. Her attitude is one of life being an experiment and she is not willing to waste any opportunity. \n\nDiscussing her resilience and tenacity in a world she knew nothing about is uplifting. It will make you rethink the freedom you have and the power of your choice.\n\nInspire yourself with these essential insights from Claire Ashman\n\nAUDIO \u0026 SHOW NOTES: http:// www.livingfabulously.com/podcasts \n\nLet\u0027s stay connected!\nWebsite: http://www.livingfabulously.com \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/livingfabulouslywithbev\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/c_change\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/bevroberts/\nPinterest: https://au.pinterest.com/LivingFabulouslywithbev \n \nDISCLAIMER\nThe information provided here \u0026 in our programs \u0026 webinars should not be seen as medical advice \u0026 is not meant to take the place of seeing licensed health professionals",
