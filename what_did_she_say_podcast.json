      "description": "In this episode, I\u2019m taking you with me to Spain\u2014where I accidentally joined what can only be described as a camp cult. Okay, maybe not a real cult, but when you hear about the chaos\u2026 you\u2019ll get it. This is Part One of my two-part diary about the English-speaking Spring camp I volunteered at. From the moment I got the email about this \u2018amazing opportunity\u2019 to my very first steps into the world of forced singing, non-stop activities, and zero personal space\u2014this week one recap covers it all. Expect some laughs, culture shock, questionable life choices, and me wondering: why did I do this to myself? Tune in as I spill everything from my first impressions, the bizarre camp rules, and the wild characters I met\u2026 and trust me, it only gets worse from here.\n\n\n\u2726 Follow me on socials:\n\uD83D\uDCF8 IG: the_contentguest\n\uD83C\uDF99\uFE0F Podcast IG: whatdidshesay_podcast\n\uD83D\uDCF1 TikTok: cgeooxo\n\n\uD83C\uDFA7 Prefer to just listen?
