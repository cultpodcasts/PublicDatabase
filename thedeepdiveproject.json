      "description": "If you would like to support my caffeine fueled endeavor, buy me a cup of joe - https://buymeacoffee.com/thedeepdiveproject In this first-of-its-kind, exclusive interview, I sit down with a former member of Opus Dei to learn more about the infamous case Tissier v. Opus Dei. The Work appears to have made a concentrated effort (allegedly) to hide the ultimate findings of the court and their own conviction in a case involving Catherine Tissier and 99 other domestic workers. As more and more people continue to come forward to share about the abuse they endured at the hands of this organization, a case like this could have tremendous ramifications for survivors seeking justice. And at the end of the day, it is yet another example of a young woman taking back her life from the clutches of Opus Dei and fighting back in a truly inspiring way. Thank you to everyone who made this interview possible. REFERENCES: -English translation of Tissier v.
