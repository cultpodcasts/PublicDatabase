Opus Dei. The Work appears to have made a concentrated effort (allegedly) to hide the ultimate findings of the court and their own conviction in a case involving Catherine Tissier and 99 other domestic workers. As more and more people continue to come forward to share about the abuse they endured at the hands of this organization, a case like this could have tremendous ramifications for survivors seeking justice. And at the end of the day, it is yet another example of a young woman taking back her life from the clutches of Opus Dei and fighting back in a truly inspiring way.

Opus Dei. The Work appears to have made a concentrated effort (allegedly) to hide the ultimate findings of the court and their own conviction in a case involving Catherine Tissier and 99 other domestic workers. As more and more people continue to come forward to share about the abuse they endured at the hands of this organization, a case like this could have tremendous ramifications for survivors seeking justice. And at the end of the day, it is yet another example of a young woman taking back her life from the clutches of Opus Dei and fighting back in a truly inspiring way.

But since then, things have changed, and I believe this organization needs to be brought back into the light and made to atone for the things it\u0027s members have done. This is the first video in what I hope will be a list of installments, diving into Opus Dei and discussing why I believe it is so problematic.\n\nImportant Links:\n-Opus Dei wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_Dei\n-JoseMaria Escriva wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josemar%C3%ADa_Escriv%C3%A1\n-Robert Hanssen: https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-Hanssen\n-McClosky article: https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2019/01/08/opus-dei-paid-settle-sexual-misconduct-claim-against-prominent-catholic-priest/\n\nGEAR:\n[Disclosure: Some of the links below are affiliate links.
