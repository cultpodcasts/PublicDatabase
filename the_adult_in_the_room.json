      "description": "An unfiltered look at Portland\u2019s rolling showdown around the ICE facility. In this episode, you\u2019ll hear how former Antifa participants describe the movement\u2019s internal roles, how safe-house logistics work on the ground, and why noise operations target neighborhoods as much as officers. You\u2019ll follow the citizen-journalist chase that helped identify a suspected rock attacker, plus a breakdown of where organizers really work when the costumes come off. Then you\u2019ll hear a veteran PI connect dots between organizers, public-sector unions, and NGOs\u2014and what he says prosecutors should publish if they\u2019re serious about accountability. #Portland #Antifa #ICE #Protest #CitizenJournalism #SafeHouse #BlackBloc #NGO #SEIU #LawAndOrder #FreeSpeech #PortlandOregon",
