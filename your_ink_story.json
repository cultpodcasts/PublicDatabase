      "description": "Greetings Inklings! Welcome to Your Ink Story Podcast, where personal sagas come alive through the power of storytelling. On this episode we dive into an extraordinary journey of resilience and transformation. Our remarkable guest, Kendra Petty, has withstood the kind of hardships most people can\u0027t even imagine. From surviving a mafia hit and escaping the clutches of an abusive cult to the harrowing battles with breast cancer and mental illness within her family, Kendra\u0027s life reads like a page-turning thriller. Yet, here she stands, not just a survivor, but a beacon of hope and powerful healing that will leave you feeling inkspired. Kendra turned her pain into purpose, penning her tribulations and triumphs with the aid of a ghostwriter, into a page-turning memoir called \u0022I Can\u0027t Believe I\u0027m Not Dead.\u0022 You\u2019ll hear how Kendra excised the negativity from her life, and curated joy and gratitude with purposeful intention. This includes the story behind her evocative \u0022lucky\u0022 tattoo, a symbol etched on her palm that serves as a powerful daily reminder to shift her pathways away from trauma and towards the power of gratitude. Tune into hear this profound conversation, and let\u0027s honor the strength it takes to turn tragedy into triumph, and the courage it takes to rewrite one\u0027s life journey. Can\u0027t get enough of Kendra\u2019s story? Dive deeper through her book, \u0022I Can\u0027t Believe I\u0027m Not Dead,\u0022 and engage with the awe*mazing stories she shares and the wonderful wisdom from her healing journey.
