      "description": "Perhaps I\u0027m paranoid, but I\u0027d like for YOU to be the judge of that. After I flew back to protest the Scientology Ideal Org in Chicago, where one of the cronies said I had non existent warrants out for my arrest, I was booked in suburban Atlanta (Cobb County), where I spent 16 hours in the can for a misdemeanor possession charge, due to being found smoking cannabis in the parking lot of my hotel. The strange thing is, the Cobb County Sheriff announced in 2019 that they\u0027re no longer arresting people for marijuana possession under an ounce. I had a quarter ounce. Scientology has an ideal org in Atlanta and a strong relationship with the police. So, watch the video and tell me your opinion. Am I going insane or is this whole deal worth investigating?\nGOFUNDME: https://gofund.me/a7d2d653",
