For years, it was framed as a wholesome Catholic family retreat...\n\nIn this video, I share my personal experience attending Catholic Family Land every summer, and why, looking back as an adult, I believe it caused serious religious and psychological harm.\n\nI discuss:\n\u2013 Family consecration and lack of consent\n\u2013 Emotional manipulation and fear-based faith\n\u2013 Vows of obedience, poverty, and chastity (worker culture)\n\u2013 Teen programming and psychological control\n\u2013 Why Catholic Family Land felt cult-like\n\nThis video is not an attack on Catholicism or people of faith. I respect religious belief and the Catholic Church. This is a critical examination of one organization and the impact it had on me and others.\n\nIf you attended Catholic Family Land or experienced religious trauma, you are not alone.\n\n*Content warning: spiritual abuse, emotional manipulation, religious trauma\n\nComment if you want to see Part 2 or share your experience.\n\n##########\n\n\nWelcome to The Anti-Alienation Project, where I discuss all things parental alienation... from the POV of an adult child who\u0027s been through it.
