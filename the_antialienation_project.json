      "description": "After hearing researchers describe parental alienation as a cult, I decided to consult America\u2019s leading cult expert: Dr. Steven Hassan. \n\nThe book \u201CFreedom of Mind\u201D by Dr. Hassan characterizes what makes a destructive cult and how to help a family member leave one. \n\nIn this video, I dissect the first part of this book as it relates to parental alienation\u2026 from the POV of a formerly alienated child. \n\n(Stay tuned for part 2!)\n\n\u0026 Check out Dr. Hassan\u2019s book here: https://www.amazon.com/shop/theanti-alienationproject/list/2SDBQNGS0JNNW?ref_=aip_sf_cur_spv_ons_d\n\n#######\n\nWelcome to The Anti-Alienation Project, where I discuss all things parental alienation... from the POV of an adult child who\u0027s been through it. I\u0027m sorry you\u0027re going through this, but I\u0027m that glad you\u0027re here:) \n\nDonate to help us continue our college campaigns: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=DZGLDEADLRC84\n\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfzOR3LLqL0fMtz_J_o4vjw/join\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter to stay up-to-date with the AAP: https://preview.mailerlite.io/preview/678166/forms/105579686796461840?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR1QdxRoKl_h97dMXYOBd1wibcv4dQTX0U_PO87laMe-W3RxdJVqfnmHB-s_aem_4GWk93B0m2YVRGk0a5VMqw\n\nCheck out my Etsy shop: https://www.etsy.com/shop/AntiAlienationP?ref=dashboard-header\n\nE-mail: theantialienationproject@gmail.com\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theantialienationproject/?igshid=OGQ5ZDc2ODk2ZA%3D%3D\n\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@theantialienationproject\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100093464962499\n\n#parentalalienation #parenting #recovery #divorce #ptsd #healing #healingjourney #mystory",
