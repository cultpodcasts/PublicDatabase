      "description": "The Social Media Advocacy speakers of the 2024 Multilevel Marketing Conference chose to explain the use of coercive control and undue influence, which is a key component that informs our perspective that MLMs are destructive commercial cults.  This is my segment, focusing on how information is controlled to manipulate consumers and avoid accountability.  Recordings of the other presentations will be added to the website after the conference.",
