      "description": "A few weeks ago, Aubrey Marcus released a podcast explaining how God told him to open up his marriage and find a younger woman and how the spirit of Isis told him to impregnate both of them. Our characters are Aubrey, 44; his wife Vyana, 38; the new addition Alana, 28; and Marc Ganfi, a culty ex-rabbi posing as a \u0022relationship coach\u0022 who was accused of molesting young girls in his time as a youth leader. Jade and I dissect the dynamics of this podcast \u2014 about what we call \u0022God,\u0022 how we know \u0022truth,\u0022 the tactics narcissists use to manipulate others, our own experience in the sex coaching world, opinions on polyamory, and more.

      "description": "Danielle grew up in a Duggar-family-style Christian cult. Leading a very sheltered childhood, she left to find her own independence as a teenager and ended up getting groomed into another \u201CChristian\u201D cult, by a narcissistic couple who sexually abused and financially exploited her. Danielle has a lot of self-awareness about exactly how this happened and also tells the story of her escape and the rebuilding of her life. She was later able to testify against her abuser in court and contributed to him going to prison. She is now happily married and has truly moved on from her past experiences.",
