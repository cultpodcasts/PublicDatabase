      "description": "Thuy Nguyen is a poet, writer and speaker on self-empowerment. She came up in a cult-like religious environment. When Thuy was a teen, she was preyed upon by a church leader and, ultimately, shunned by that community. Adam talks with Thuy about those experiences, how she broke free from the church, and what she\u2019s learned about leadership, accountability and forgiveness in the process. They also talk about mental health, including Thuy\u2019s experience of postpartum depression \u2013 the fear, the extreme paranoia \u2013 and how she worked her way through that and found the light again.__________ We Are Chaffee\u0027s Looking Upstream podcast is a collaboration with Chaffee County (Colo.)
