      "title": "Sexless Cult Leader? The Real History of Anne Lee and the Shakers",
      "description": "When most people think of the Shakers, they think of colonial groups making beautifully crafted furniture\u2026but the real history behind this religious group is far darker and stranger than well made tables and chairs. \n\nIn this video, we dive into the unsettling life of Mother Ann Lee, the illiterate factory worker who became the \u0022female Christ\u0022 of a movement that banned sex, marriage, and private property.\n\nI\u2019ll explore the rise of the \u0022Shaking Quakers\u0022 in 18th-century England and America, asking the ultimate question: beneath the peaceful aesthetic, was this actually a dangerous cult? \n\nWe\u2019ll also take a look at the upcoming musical film The Testament of Ann Lee starring Amanda Seyfried. With its unique take on religious hysteria and female power, could this be the surprise hit of 2026?\n\nResources from this video!
