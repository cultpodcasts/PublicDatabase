      "description": "#eckankar\n#cultsandextremebeliefs\n#haroldklemp\n\nToday, I want to take a moment and discuss cult propaganda and ads. I have been speaking out about the Eckankar cult for years and today we are going to watch several of their ads, watch a tour of their Temple of Eck in Chanhassen, Minnesota and read through the journal they want all members to use daily. I think it is important to speak out about these topics and discuss the coercive control methods and manipulation tactics used to trick people into joining this cult under the guise of singing some Hu and being a part of an all inclusive religion. Media literacy is important and like all cults, Eckankar will prey on vulnerabilities. \n\nTo help support the work I do speaking out about cults, please think about donating to my PayPal so YouTube doesn\u0027t take 30% of it and we can make better use of the funds.

Her experience also highlights how individuals like myself \u2014 especially those of us on the Autism Spectrum \u2014 can be uniquely vulnerable to cultish manipulation, and how difficult, yet vital, the road to recovery can be.\n\nThis platform exists to hold cult leaders accountable and to offer survivors a soft place to land \u2014 a space where their stories are heard, honored, and amplified. I want to thank Dagmar for her trust and vulnerability. It was an honor to meet her, and I wish her continued strength and healing on her journey.\n\nIf you or someone you know is currently in ISKCON or another high-control group and wants to share their story, please reach out to me at bethgibbons74@gmail.com or connect via my social media links below. \n\nYou are not alone.\n\nFor my past coverage on Hare Krishna (ISKCON): \nBhakti Vidya Purna Swami, ISKCON, and the Mayapur Gurukula Controversy: https://www.dehek.com/general/anti-mlm-cults/bhakti-vidya-purna-swami-iskcon-and-the-mayapur-gurukula-controversy/\nKrishna Cults and Western Offshoots: A Critical Guide: https://www.dehek.com/general/anti-mlm-cults/krishna-cults-and-western-offshoots-a-critical-guide/\nThe Strange Overlap: Hare Krishna, O9A, 764, and Josh Sutter: https://youtu.be/3AHfm6yJ_IU?si=5q2vopf5j4_nzlmc\n\nPlease support small businesses!

      "description": "#eckankar\n#cults\n#religiouscults\n\nIn this livestream, we\u2019re diving into the mysterious world of Eckankar\u2014a lesser-known but still active cult founded by Paul Twitchell in the 1960s. Before starting Eckankar, Twitchell worked his way up in Scientology and even achieved the level of \u0022Clear.\u0022 But instead of sticking with L. Ron Hubbard\u0027s teachings, he borrowed heavily from them\u2014along with ideas from Theosophy, Radhasoami, and other traditions\u2014to create his own spiritual movement.\n\nWe\u2019ll explore Twitchell\u2019s early life, the lies he told about his background, and how scholar David C. Lane exposed its plagiarized roots. Lane\u2019s groundbreaking research revealed just how much of Eckankar was copied from other sources\u2014and how Twitchell manipulated his image to appear as a divine messenger.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never heard of Eckankar, you\u2019re not alone\u2014but it\u2019s time we start talking about it again. This is a great introduction to this religious cult. \n\nFor my other coverage of the Eckankar cult, see these videos/streams:\nTheir Glossary of Terms - https://youtube.com/live/eJnQQ3JbURI?feature=share\n\nEckankar Book Reviews:\nSpiritual Stress Relief - https://youtu.be/i7GytPYJi4o\nThe Power of Gratitude - https://youtu.be/dX8oWT1ZKRo\nFinding Life\u0027s Purpose - https://youtu.be/knS4awjWriY\nHu - https://youtu.be/89PgGLS9HMg\nSecrets of Divine Creativity - https://youtu.be/bKhAZm_krPw\nDivine Guidance - https://youtu.be/6yNo9Eqi-PA\nKarma \u0026 Reincarnation - https://youtube.com/live/WR76-ruLVRE?feature=share\n\nOther Coverage:\nReacting to a Soul Travel Experience - https://youtu.be/iGL85LoH2xY\nReacting to Harold Klemp - https://youtu.be/_N9s72sPnpo\nCult Discussion on Eckankar - https://youtube.com/live/MWuP2VUXdmY?feature=share\nMore on Soul Travel - https://youtube.com/live/sOrOk2SMkGU?feature=share\n\nResources for this Stream:\nThe Making of a Spiritual Movement book - https://www.amazon.com/Making-Spiritual-Movement-Twitchell-Eckankar/dp/0961112468\nSurviving the Cult Eckankar - https://www.angelfire.com/hi2/eckankarsurvivors/\nOMGuru Article - https://www.om-guru.com/html/saints/twitchell01.html\nEckankar HU Chant: Experience the Sound of Soul - https://youtu.be/B0Y8o_-1drM?si=z1y9VGP-2IikVSQ4\nHU: Experience the Sound of Soul - https://youtu.be/jgBoCO3Dw2g?si=89KhzC38gyPNXNY_\nModern Day Eck Masters - https://religionsmn.carleton.edu/exhibits/show/eckankar/organization-and-clergy/modern-day-eck-masters\n\n\uD83C\uDF99\uFE0F New to streaming or looking to level up?

      "description": "#foreverliving  \n#mlmexposed  \n#antimlm \n\nForever Living, one of the most well-known MLMs in the world, is now charging its distributors a $3 monthly fee just to access their back office and run their so-called \u0022business.\u0022 In this video, I break down what this fee means, why it\u0027s problematic, and how it\u0027s yet another example of MLM companies profiting off their own members rather than actual product sales.\n\nThis is a classic move used by multi-level marketing schemes to squeeze money from their downlines under the guise of \u0022business tools.\u0022 But is it ethical? Is it even legal? And how does it reflect on the overall MLM business model?\n\nLet\u2019s talk about it.\n\n\uD83D\uDC49 Don\u2019t forget to like, comment, and subscribe for more deep dives on scams, cults, and MLM exploitation.\n\nPlease support small businesses!
