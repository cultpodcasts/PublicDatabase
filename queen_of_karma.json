      "title": "MLM Cult Forever Living Wants YOU to Pay to Work for Them",
      "description": "#foreverliving  \n#mlmexposed  \n#antimlm \n\nForever Living, one of the most well-known MLMs in the world, is now charging its distributors a $3 monthly fee just to access their back office and run their so-called \u0022business.\u0022 In this video, I break down what this fee means, why it\u0027s problematic, and how it\u0027s yet another example of MLM companies profiting off their own members rather than actual product sales.\n\nThis is a classic move used by multi-level marketing schemes to squeeze money from their downlines under the guise of \u0022business tools.\u0022 But is it ethical? Is it even legal? And how does it reflect on the overall MLM business model?\n\nLet\u2019s talk about it.\n\n\uD83D\uDC49 Don\u2019t forget to like, comment, and subscribe for more deep dives on scams, cults, and MLM exploitation.\n\nPlease support small businesses!
