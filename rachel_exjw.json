      "description": "Appendix B1 of the revised New World Translation (2013) is puzzling. There is no reference to Jesus\u0027 supposed enthronement as heavenly King in 1914. There is only a very vague reference to Satan being cast to earth \u0022about\u0022 1914. It looks like this revison has been future proofed. What do you think?\n\nIn the past Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses who did not accept the 1914 date were considered apostate and disfellowshipped.  A question from readers article in the 1986 April 1 Watchtower, page 31 ,  stated, \u0022Approved association with Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses requires accepting the entire range of the true teachings of the Bible, including those Scriptural beliefs that are unique to Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses. What do such beliefs include?.......That 1914 marked the end of the Gentile Times and the establishment of the Kingdom of God in the heavens, as well as the time for Christ\u0027s foretold presence.\u0022",
