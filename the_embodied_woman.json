      "title": "What I Learned Escaping a Cult \u2014 and How It Can Help Us Heal",
      "description": "I don\u2019t usually share this publicly, but it\u2019s part of my story: I was groomed into a cult.\n\nAt first it felt like belonging\u2026 until I realized I was being manipulated through love-bombing, gaslighting, isolation, and control. One of the hardest parts was watching others stay silent \u2014 even when they knew what was happening \u2014 because they were too afraid to question or leave.\n\nIn this video, I share how I found the courage to walk away, and why I now see the same tactics being used in the world around us. We\u2019re constantly told it\u2019s us vs. them, right vs. wrong, red vs. blue. But that\u2019s just a distraction.\n\nBecause while we\u2019re fighting each other, the people at the top \u2014 the billionaires funding both sides \u2014 keep getting richer. Division feeds the system.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about choosing a side. It\u2019s about remembering our shared humanity, asking deeper questions, and finding our way back to ourselves.\n\n\uD83D\uDCAC I\u2019d love to hear from you: how do you come back to your own truth when the world feels loud and divided?\n\nAnd if you need support, want to work with me, or simply want someone to listen \u2014 I\u2019m here. DM me or email embodiedwithemma@gmail.com. I\u2019d love to hear from you.",
