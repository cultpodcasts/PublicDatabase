      "description": "A Note from James This might be the most insane chess story I\u2019ve ever heard\u2014not even really a chess story, but a cult story. It\u2019s wild, intense, and ultimately inspiring. Danny Rensch grew up in a cult in Arizona. At just 10 years old, the cult leader noticed his chess ability, took him away from his parents, and he wouldn\u2019t see his mother again for a decade. I first heard Danny\u2019s story when we met at Norway Chess a year and a half ago. Over dinner, he told me pieces of what would become his book Dark Squares: How Chess Saved My Life. I worried later that I\u2019d pushed him into podcast mode before he was ready, but Danny said he was actually grateful for the chance to practice sharing his story out loud. Now, with his book out, he\u2019s ready to open up fully. Episode Description Danny Rensch, Chief Chess Officer at Chess.com and author of Dark Squares: How Chess Saved My Life, shares the extraordinary story of how growing up in a cult shaped his childhood, his chess career, and his path to resilience. From being separated from his mother at age 10, to navigating indoctrination, hierarchy, and trauma, Danny explains how chess became both his prison and his salvation. This conversation is about more than chess\u2014it\u2019s about control, identity, purpose, and how to reclaim your life from the stories others force on you. What You\u2019ll Learn How a cult leader used chess as propaganda\u2014and how Danny reclaimed the game as his own. The three pillars of cult life Danny experienced: like vibration, the process, and purpose. Why vulnerability and storytelling can be healing\u2014but also how they can be weaponized. The psychological toll of being told your \u201Cpurpose\u201D at age 12\u2014and how to build a new one. What Danny learned about resilience, family, and community after leaving the cult.
