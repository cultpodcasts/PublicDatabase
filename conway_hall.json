[We contacted the London branch of the Church of Scientology to send a representative, but did not get a reply from them.]\n\nUS journalist Tony Ortega, author of an acclaimed biography, The Unbreakable Miss Lovely: How the Church of Scientology tried to destroy Paulette Cooper, John Sweeney, the BBC Panorama journalist and author of The Church Of Fear: Inside the Weird World of Scientology and the publisher of both books, Humfrey Hunter, explain what it is like to question the word and the worth of the Church that likes to wear dark glasses.\n\nTony Ortega has written about Scientology as a journalist for nearly 20 years, and began working with Paulette Cooper about her life story while he was still at the Voice. Ortega appears in Alex Gibney\u2019s HBO-produced documentary about Scientology, Going Clear, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nJohn Sweeney is a writer and journalist. His philosophy as a reporter is: \u2018I poke crocodiles, if crocodiles they be, in the eye with a stick.\u2019\n\nHe\u2019s helped free seven people falsely accused of killing their babies and reported on wars, revolutions and trouble in 80 countries, but he\u2019s most famous for doing an impression of an exploding tomato while investigating the Church of Scientology.\n\nHumfrey Hunter previously published John Sweeney\u2019s book, The Church of Fear: Inside the Weird World of Scientology, and last year brought Russell Miller\u2019s landmark biography of Scientology\u2019s founder, Bare-Faced Messiah: The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard, back into print for the first time in 27 years.\n\n--\n\nThe videos cut from this talk can be found here:\n\nScientology and Me\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HGM8DSnYh0\n\nPanorama - BBC One\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjlo4u_8g60\n\nLoses it with Scientologist!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLI1Al3S_pE\n\n--\n\nConway Hall hosts a wide variety of talks, concerts, exhibitions, courses, performances, community and social events. It is also renowned as a hub for free speech and independent thought, hosting suffragettes, political radicals, scientists, philosophers, artists, performers; campaign, charities and other non- profit organisations.",
