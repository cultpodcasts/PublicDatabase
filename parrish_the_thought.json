      "description": "Ladies and gentlemen, and whoever else is listening. Welcome back again to the show. This may be one of the most intriguing episodes in the last 5 years. Several months ago I interviewed author Charlene Paul , Episode 159 , who wrote a book called Devotion Deliverance Deception, Keep Sweet - Pray and Obey, Isaac\u0027s Story about a young mans\u0027 life journey inside the FLDS Church and the world of polygamy and mind control. Today we have the subject of that book, Isaac Steed with us. Buckle up for a more in-depth look at what it was like growing up, and living a \u0022happy normal childhood\u0022 inside the FLDS Church and the tightrope walking it took to survive under the total and absolute control of the then leader Warren Jeffs and what it was like to be banished in an instant for no apparent reason after literally devoting EVERYTHING to the group. #FLDSChurch #WarrenJeffs #ShortCreek #ColoradoCity #Hilldale #LostBoys #DevotionDeceptionDeliverance #Polygamy #ChildBrides #MasterDeceiver #KeepSweetPrayObey #KeepSweet #GodKnows #FollowTheProphet",
