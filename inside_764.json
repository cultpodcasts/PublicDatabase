      "description": "*This episode is an investigation into a major public safety issue*\n\nEpisode 5 of Inside 764 pulls back the curtain on the chain of events that ignited one of the most disturbing youth extremist movements of the digital age. What begins with a Hindu cult in rural North Carolina spirals into a web of neo-Nazi ideology, forbidden texts, and a paid FBI informant whose work would shape 764\u2019s foundations.\n\nWe follow the story of a survivor who unknowingly befriended the man at the centre of it all, only to discover his ties to O9A, Temple Ov Blood, Martinet Press and Atomwaffen Division. Experts reveal how his writings and doctrines spread across the internet, seeping into the minds of teenagers \u2014 even as the FBI quietly paid him more than $140k while he produced material later echoed inside 764.\n\nThis episode exposes the hidden machinery behind the cult\u2019s rise and asks a haunting question: what happens when the government\u2019s own informant becomes one of the most powerful accelerants of modern extremism?\n\nFollow us on socials too:\nTiktok:   / inside764podcast   \nInstagram:   / inside764podcast",
