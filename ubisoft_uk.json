      "description": "What\u2019s the fascination with secretive religious organisations?  They\u2019re an eternal engine of pop culture content, depicted in movies, TV shows, and video games.  People are intrigued by them, even if they don\u2019t know much about them.  This month the latest game in Far Cry 5 franchise launches and with it comes a brand-new religious cult.  All started by one bad seed. Or more specifically, a whole family of them.\n\nThe game depicts a small town, Hope County, in Montana USA, under siege as it attempts to fight back against the Seed family and regain control.  Although quite obviously fictional, Hope County is like any other town.  It looks to be pretty idyllic, packed with sights of natural beauty and surrounded by fields of green. In fact, it\u2019s a lot like a little town not too far away.  A small town of around 26,000 people, an hour from Central London and the home of Winnie the Pooh \u2013 East Grinstead.\n\nFar Cry 5 is on sale 27/03/18 - Buy from Ubisoft Store http://ubi.li/hw22t",
