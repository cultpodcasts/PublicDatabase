      "description": "Buzzfeed reports that Kelly lures young women into his inner circle and keeps them against their will inside his homes in a \u0022cult-like\u0022 atmosphere. The story says six women are being held in the star\u0027s properties, where he controls all aspects of their lives.\nBuzzfeed also interviewed three former members of Kelly\u0027s inner circle, and reports the singer controls every aspect of the women\u0027s lives: dictating \u0022what they eat, how they dress, when they bathe, when they sleep, and how they engage in sexual encounters that he records\u0022.\nThe superstar also confiscates the women\u0027s cell phones, the report says, barring contact with friends and family. He gives them new phones that they are only allowed to use to contact him or others with his permission.\nThe story was written by Jim DeRogatis, who has covered the allegations against R Kelly for two decades, principally for the Chicago Sun Times.\nAll of the women cited in his article are of legal age; and one has denied accusations that she is being held against her will.\n\u0022I\u0027m not being brainwashed or anything like that,\u0022 said 21-year-old Joycelyn Savage in a video call to TMZ. However, she would not reveal where she was speaking from, nor the nature of her relationship with Kelly.\nR Kelly\u0027s lawyer, Linda Mensch, has also issued a strongly-worded denial of the accusations.\n\u0022Mr Robert Kelly is both alarmed and disturbed at the recent revelations attributed to him,\u0022 the statement said.\n\u0022Mr Kelly unequivocally denies such allegations and will work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.\u0022\n\nPlease subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nWorld In Pictures https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS3XGZxi7cBX37n4R0UGJN-TLiQOm7ZTP\nBig Hitters https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS3XGZxi7cBUME-LUrFkDwFmiEc3jwMXP\nJust Good News https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS3XGZxi7cBUsYo_P26cjihXLN-k3w246",
