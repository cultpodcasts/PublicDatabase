      "description": "The have been fiery scenes on Capitol Hill as survivors of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s abuse and their Democrat supporters accused the US Justice Department of a cover-up.   They say there is still no transparency despite the release of millions of documents relating to the convicted sex offender.\n\nA hearing before US lawmakers descended into a shouting match, as US Attorney General Pam Bondi was challenged to address Epstein\u2019s victims and explain why nobody had been charged with offences related to his crimes.  \n\nAs a group of Epstein\u2019s victims stood behind Bondi at the House Judiciary Committee hearing, she was told:  \u201CThose are just some of the hundreds of survivors of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s global sex trafficking ring who are demanding that the truth be told and are demanding accountability for the abusers who trafficked and raped them.\u201D\n\nBondi defended her handling of the Epstein files, stating:  \u201CI have spent my entire career fighting for victims, and I will continue to do so.  I am deeply sorry for what any victim, any victim, has been through, especially as a result of that monster.\u201D\n\nThe Department of Justice has faced criticism for failing to bring promised transparency in the Epstein case and also releasing confidential information about his victims.\n\nMeanwhile in the UK Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor is facing more questions about his links with Epstein and confidential information it appears he sent to the sex offender when Andrew was the UK\u2019s trade envoy. \n\nClive Myrie presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Gary O\u2019Donoghue and Sean Coughlan. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
