      "description": "Recording of an online seminar organized by the Challenging Psychedelic Experiences Project April 17 2024, featuring cult expert Dr Steve Hassan and Jules Evans, director of the Challenging Psychedelic Experiences Project. How can toxic high control groups manipulate and coerce us, and how can they use psychedelic drugs for this purpose?
