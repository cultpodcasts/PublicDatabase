      "description": "Today\u2019s episode is so interesting and insightful with my guest, Libby Wescombe!\n\nLibby was born into and raised in a cult in Thailand. Around puberty, she began to ask questions and see that the teachings in the cult weren\u2019t quite aligned with what she felt was true in the real world. After spending the first part of her life in Thailand, and then in a different section in the cult in the middle east, she made the decision to leave at the age of 21.\n\nWith very little tools for success in the real world, LIbby struggled to rebuild her life in Australia, finding work, buying food, all while navigating young motherhood with her daughter. She found solace in joining a gym that allowed her to take control over an area of her life and found her passion in fitness by eventually becoming a trainer.\n\nLibby is now a very popular face in the fitness world, and she shared her opinions on the lack of fitness and how it truly impacts the health and wellness of her clients and especially women. It goes beyond just physical appearance and penetrates deep down into your biomechanics that affect your energy, insulin sensitivity, and sleep. \n\nBuilding up our fitness regimen slowly and gradually helps set you up for success with good habits, and helps combat the misconception of exercise intolerance. While it exists as a medical condition, it is becoming an identity that women are using in response to being deconditioned and out of shape.\n\nLibby shares more about building the fundamentals of exercise and how to get past the difficult spells of starting exercise.
