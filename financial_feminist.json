      "description": "CW: SA, abuse, loss, trauma What happens when the doctrines of faith and control intersect with a woman\u0027s autonomy? In this episode, I sat down with Tia Levings, author of the powerful memoir \u201CA Well-Trained Wife,\u201D and her story will leave you speechless. Tia dives deep into her experience growing up in and escaping from Christian fundamentalism and the trad wife movement\u2014 before it was even called that. We talk about how patriarchal control impacts women financially, emotionally, and physically, and how that same mindset influences the political movements we\u0027re seeing today. If you\u0027ve ever wondered how personal freedom intersects with religion, politics, and financial independence, this is the episode for you.

      "description": "The world is obsessed with cults \u2013\u2013 and there are more documentaries and true crime podcasts than ever on some of the most controversial organizations. But not every cult is so apparent, and there are smaller, less insidious-seeming figures that are doing harm daily, especially to women and other already marginalized communities. To better understand how these organizations operate, we sat down with Dr. Janja Lalich, who has dedicated her life to the study of cults and helping members and their families get out and recover. She vulnerably shares about her time in a cult and the ways in which cults use emotional manipulation and abuse against women.
