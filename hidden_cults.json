      "title": "Ep.19 Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God",
      "description": "In the lush hills of Uganda during the 1980s and 90s, a new religious group claimed to offer clarity in a time of social and political upheaval. Calling themselves The Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God, the leaders preached a return to strict biblical law and obedience to visions of the Virgin Mary. At its heart were promises of purity, repentance, and survival of the coming apocalypse. But what began as a community of Marian visionaries and devout followers soon spiraled into secrecy, deprivation, and control. Members were forbidden to speak, forced into silence as a form of obedience. Prophecies of the end of the world kept believers loyal, even as leaders demanded more sacrifices of land, possessions, and absolute devotion. On the eve of the year 2000, when the world was preparing to celebrate a new millennium, tragedy struck. Instead of salvation, over 700 members of the movement perished in what at first looked like a mass suicide, but soon revealed signs of something even more sinister. This episode explores how the promise of divine protection became a tool for manipulation, and how one of the deadliest cult tragedies in modern history unfolded in near silence on the global stage.\n\nPart 1 \u2013 Prophets in the Hills\nPart 2 \u2013 Building the Ark\nPart 3 \u2013 The Commandments Rewritten\nPart 4 \u2013 Countdown to the End\nPart 5 \u2013 The Fire of Kanungu\nPart 6 \u2013 Ashes and Lessons\n\nFrom silent compounds to subway attacks, from charismatic prophets to catastrophic ends, Hidden Cults is a documentary-style podcast that digs deep into the world\u0027s most extreme, elusive, and explosive fringe groups.

      "title": "Ep.18 Synanon",
      "description": "It began in 1958 as a radical experiment in recovery: a storefront in Santa Monica, a handful of addicts, and a tough-talking ex-alcoholic named Charles Dederich. What started as a lifeline for people desperate to break free from addiction soon grew into a powerful movement with thousands of members, sprawling compounds, and its own strict rules of life. Synanon promised transformation through brutal honesty and communal living, but the deeper people went, the harder it became to get out. In this episode, we follow Synanon\u2019s journey from celebrated rehab innovation to infamous cult. We\u2019ll explore the confrontational \u201CGame\u201D sessions, the charismatic but authoritarian leadership of Dederich, and the gradual shift from treatment community to closed society with its own laws and punishments. By the 1970s, Synanon had turned into something darker, complete with forced sterilizations, violent enforcement, and plots against its critics. Synanon\u2019s story is not just about addiction and recovery. It\u2019s about the dangerous line between salvation and control, and how a movement built on hope could twist into coercion and fear.\n\nPart 1 \u2013 The Experiment Begins\nPart 2 \u2013 The Game\nPart 3 \u2013 The Utopia Vision\nPart 4 \u2013 The Turn to Control\nPart 5 \u2013 The Snake in the Mailbox\nPart 6 \u2013 Echoes of Synanon\n\nFrom silent compounds to subway attacks, from charismatic prophets to catastrophic ends, Hidden Cults is a documentary-style podcast that digs deep into the world\u0027s most extreme, elusive, and explosive fringe groups.

      "description": "In this episode of Hidden Cults, we turn our attention to the Unification Church, more commonly known as \u201CThe Moonies.\u201D Founded in Korea in the 1950s by Sun Myung Moon, the group grew into a global movement that promised spiritual salvation through \u201CTrue Parents\u201D but became infamous for its mass weddings, rigid hierarchy, and intense demands on followers. We explore Moon\u2019s rise from post-war Korea to international notoriety, how the movement blended Christian language with unique theology, and why it attracted both devoted believers and harsh critics. Along the way, we examine the group\u2019s vast financial empire, political connections, and the psychological toll on members caught between faith and control. The story of the Unification Church is one of devotion, manipulation, and the blurred line between religion and cult. It asks us to consider how charismatic leaders can reshape belief on a massive scale, and at what cost.

      "description": "The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, or FLDS, is one of the most secretive and controversial offshoots of Mormonism. Built on the practice of polygamy long after the mainstream church abandoned it, the FLDS created isolated communities where obedience to leaders was absolute and individuality was erased. Under the rule of Warren Jeffs, the group became synonymous with forced marriages, child brides, and an authoritarian system that demanded complete loyalty. In this episode, we trace the history of the FLDS from its 20th-century roots to its transformation into a rigid theocracy. We\u2019ll explore how its members were cut off from the outside world, how fear and devotion kept families in line, and how Jeffs rise to power ended with a dramatic downfall that exposed the inner workings of the sect. This is the story of a community built on faith, secrecy, and control, and the human cost of unquestioned devotion.\n\nPart 1 \u2013 Roots in the Desert\nPart 2 \u2013 The Prophet\u2019s Word\nPart 3 \u2013 Building the Kingdom\nPart 4 \u2013 Life Behind the Walls\nPart 5 \u2013 Cracks in the Foundation\nPart 6 \u2013 Fall of the Prophet\n\nFrom silent compounds to subway attacks, from charismatic prophets to catastrophic ends, Hidden Cults is a documentary-style podcast that digs deep into the world\u0027s most extreme, elusive, and explosive fringe groups.

      "description": "What looks like a dance collective on TikTok is, according to former members and family, something much darker. Behind the viral choreography and millions of views lies 7M Films, a management company run by Robert Shinn, a self-proclaimed pastor with a long history of spiritual control. Dancers who signed with 7M found their lives increasingly directed not just on stage, but in every personal decision, from finances and friendships to faith. Families watched their loved ones disappear into a world of rehearsals, prayers, and contracts that blurred the line between religion and business. In this episode, we trace how a Pentecostal church in Los Angeles transformed into a social media empire, why allegations of exploitation and manipulation continue to surface, and what the 7M story reveals about the rise of digital-age cults.

      "description": "It started in Brooklyn as a small religious group focused on Black identity and spiritual truth. Over time, it grew into something stranger. The Nuwaubian Nation built pyramids in Georgia, talked about UFOs and lost civilizations, and claimed their leader, Dwight York, was more than just a man. He called himself a prophet, a savior, even an alien messenger. But behind all the symbols, costumes, and shifting beliefs was something far more disturbing. In this episode of Hidden Cults, we follow the rise of Dwight York and the transformation of his movement. From city storefronts to a massive compound in rural Georgia, the Nuwaubian Nation drew in thousands with its mix of mysticism, nationalism, and science fiction. What most followers didn\u2019t see was the system of control, isolation, and abuse that grew along with it. This isn\u2019t just a story about a strange cult. It\u2019s about how faith and identity can be exploited. And how the promise of truth can be used to hide the worst kinds of lies.

Each episode unpacks a different cult with investigative depth, emotional clarity, and gripping storytelling. You\u0027ll hear the full timeline: from the origins and ideology, to the rise of control, to the final descent into chaos. We\u0027re not here for the sensational. We\u0027re here for the truth.

      "description": "In the heat and haze of the 1960s, Charles Manson didn\u2019t look like a cult leader. He looked like a drifter with a guitar and some big ideas. But behind the music and the talk of love was something darker. Something that would end in blood. In this episode of Hidden Cults, we follow the story of the Manson Family from its earliest days on the fringes of the counterculture to the horrific murders that shocked the world. We dig into how Manson built his following, what he promised, and how he convinced others to kill in his name. This isn\u2019t just a story about a cult, it\u2019s about influence, manipulation, and the line between belief and destruction.

In this episode of Hidden Cults, we follow the full rise and collapse of the Peoples Temple.

In this episode of Hidden Cults, we uncover the chilling rise and fall of The Order of the Solar Temple. Founded in Europe in the late 1980s, this apocalyptic group blended New Age mysticism, Templar mythology, and conspiracy to justify its descent into control, paranoia, and fatal prophecy. From its charismatic leaders and wealthy elite followers to the carefully staged deaths across Switzerland, France, and Canada, this is the true story behind one of the most disturbing cults in modern history. We follow the timeline step by step, from obscure recruitment to coordinated group suicides cloaked in fire and secrecy. What did they believe? Why did so many die? And how did it go so far without anyone stopping it? This is not just a story of belief gone wrong. It\u0027s a warning, about power, persuasion, and what happens when salvation is used as a weapon.

Led by Marshall Applewhite and Bonnie Nettles, the group blended UFO mythology, New Age beliefs, and extreme spiritual discipline into a tightly controlled system that convinced 39 people to willingly \u0022exit their vehicles\u0022 and board a spacecraft they believed was hiding behind the Hale Bopp comet. From their early days as wandering seekers to their eerie final moments inside a California mansion, this is the full chronicle. Rituals, castrations, web design, and a promise of escape from Earth.
