      "description": "In this powerful survivor story, sent in by Terrence, we hear his firsthand account of life inside The Way International, a group that began as a Bible study movement and grew into one of America\u2019s most controversial religious organizations. Born into the group as a third-generation member, Terrence recounts life within the fellowship, its strict control over members, and its denial of key Christian doctrines. He describes the pressure to conform, the emotional toll on families, and the manipulation masked as faith. After escaping the group not once, but twice, Terrence reflects on the lasting effects of indoctrination, the struggle to rebuild his faith, and the courage it takes to speak out after years of silence.\n\n\nFrom silent compounds to subway attacks, from charismatic prophets to catastrophic ends, Hidden Cults is a documentary-style podcast that digs deep into the world\u0027s most extreme, elusive, and explosive fringe groups.

      "description": "Founded by Nigerian preacher T. B. Joshua, the Synagogue Church of All Nations rose from humble beginnings in Lagos to become one of the most powerful and controversial megachurches in Africa. Millions tuned in to his televised healings and prophecies, believing they were witnessing divine intervention. But behind the spectacle were troubling questions about manipulation, secrecy, and control. This episode of Hidden Cults investigates how SCOAN built a global following through miracle crusades, media influence, and the cult of personality surrounding its founder. We explore testimonies from former followers, allegations of abuse and exploitation, and the church\u2019s efforts to protect its image even after Joshua\u2019s death. In a world where faith and fame often collide, SCOAN became both a sanctuary and a stage, and the line between salvation and subjugation blurred beyond recognition.

      "description": "In this episode of Hidden Cults, we explore The Black Hammer Organization, a radical political movement that promised liberation for the oppressed but spiralled into paranoia, violence, and control. Founded by a young activist with a gift for rhetoric and a thirst for revolution, the group drew in disillusioned followers with talk of anti-colonial struggle and communal living. What began as an online movement soon became a real-world experiment in isolation and fear. From the creation of \u201CHammer City\u201D to the shocking death that brought the group to national attention, this episode unpacks how idealism curdled into tyranny, and how charisma and chaos can blur the line between activism and cult.

But behind the golden domes and vast gatherings lay allegations of corruption, political influence, and financial fraud. In this episode of Hidden Cults, we explore the rise of Dhammakaya and its founders Chandra Khonnokyoong and Luang Por Dhammajayo. From its futuristic vision and prosperity teachings to the dramatic government siege of 2017, this story reveals how faith, money, and control can blur together inside a spiritual empire.

      "description": "In 2023, the world was horrified by the discovery of mass graves in Shakahola Forest, Kenya. Behind the tragedy was Paul Mackenzie, a self-proclaimed pastor who led his followers into the wilderness with promises of salvation through starvation. As families sold their possessions and withdrew from society, Mackenzie preached that death by fasting would deliver them to heaven. In this episode of Hidden Cults, we trace Mackenzie\u2019s journey from preacher to prophet of destruction. We explore how his anti-modern teachings rejected schools, medicine, and government, and how devotion turned into mass death. Survivor accounts, police reports, and the voices of grieving relatives reveal a story of manipulation, obedience, and the terrifying power of belief. Part 1 \u2013 A Preacher Rises Part 2 \u2013 Seeds of the Gospel of End Times Part 3 \u2013 Into the Forest Part 4 \u2013 Starving for Salvation Part 5 \u2013 The Graves of Shakahola Part 6 \u2013 Justice and Warnings From silent compounds to subway attacks, from charismatic prophets to catastrophic ends, Hidden Cults is a documentary-style podcast that digs deep into the world\u0027s most extreme, elusive, and explosive fringe groups.

      "description": "In the 1970s, deep in the Ozark hills of Arkansas, preacher James Ellison built a compound that fused apocalyptic Christianity with white supremacist ideology. His group, known as the CSA, trained with weapons, preached about the end of days, and forged ties with other extremist networks like the Aryan Nations. Families lived under strict authoritarian rule while stockpiles of arms and survivalist drills prepared them for what they believed was an imminent holy war. This episode of Hidden Cults follows the rise of the CSA from a small separatist community to one of the most feared militia-style cults of the 1980s. We trace their violent connections, their criminal activities, and the dramatic 1985 FBI siege that ended with Ellison\u2019s surrender. Survivor accounts reveal what life was like inside the compound, while experts unpack how apocalyptic faith can merge with extremist politics. The story of the CSA remains a chilling reminder of how religion, hate, and weapons can combine into a volatile and dangerous movement. Part 1 \u2013 Seeds of Extremism Part 2 \u2013 Building the Compound Part 3 \u2013 Faith, Hate, and Control Part 4 \u2013 Crimes and Connections Part 5 \u2013 The Siege of 1985 Part 6 \u2013 Echoes of CSA From silent compounds to subway attacks, from charismatic prophets to catastrophic ends, Hidden Cults is a documentary-style podcast that digs deep into the world\u0027s most extreme, elusive, and explosive fringe groups.

      "description": "In the early 1980s, Chicago was gripped by fear as women vanished and bodies were discovered mutilated in ways that suggested ritualistic violence. At the center of the storm was Robin Gecht and his \u201CRipper Crew,\u201D consisting of Edward Spreitzer and brothers Andrew and Thomas Kokoraleis, who carried out a series of brutal abductions and murders. Gecht, a former associate of serial killer John Wayne Gacy, wrapped his crimes in a twisted mix of satanic ritual, loyalty, and sadistic control. In this episode of Hidden Cults, we unravel how the crew formed, the horrific nature of their crimes, and the chilling rumors of Gecht\u2019s attic \u201Cchapel.\u201D We trace the police investigation that finally brought the group down, the confessions that exposed the rituals of blood, and the sensational trials that shocked Chicago. Survivor testimonies and the legacy of terror left behind show how cult-like devotion can merge with criminality to unleash unimaginable violence.

      "description": "In the 1920s, Los Angeles became home to a little-known but extraordinary cult led by May Otis Blackburn and her daughter Ruth. Claiming to receive visions from eleven angels, May declared herself the keeper of hidden scriptures that promised untold wealth and the coming of a new divine kingdom. Followers were drawn in with promises of prosperity and power, only to face bizarre rituals, fraudulent schemes, and disturbing reports of animal sacrifices and mysterious deaths. In this episode of Hidden Cults, we uncover how Blackburn built the Divine Order of the Royal Arms of the Great Eleven, how her apocalyptic visions collided with money and scandal, and how the group\u2019s downfall revealed the strange intersection of faith, fraud, and spiritual experimentation in California\u2019s roaring twenties. Survivor accounts, court documents, and sensational headlines tell the story of a cult that promised glory but left behind scandal and shadows.

      "description": "Founded in 1971 by Jimmie T. Roberts, The Brethren, also called The Road Ministry or the \u201CGarbage Eaters\u201D, became one of the most secretive cult movements in America. Roberts demanded that followers abandon their families, possessions, and even their identities to live as nomads, scavenging for food and sleeping in fields while preaching an apocalyptic gospel. For decades, the group drifted across the highways and small towns of the United States, nearly invisible yet leaving behind broken families and haunting survivor testimonies. In this episode of Hidden Cults, we trace the rise of Roberts from a disillusioned Southern preacher to the leader of a wandering flock. We examine how members were recruited, the hardships of life on the road, the growing paranoia that kept them hidden, and the cracks that eventually emerged as media exposure and family rescues shed light on their secretive world. Survivor voices reveal the price of radical obedience and what remains of The Brethren today.

      "description": "Founded in 1942 by Victor Paul Wierwille, The Way International began as a small evangelical ministry in Ohio and quickly grew into a worldwide movement. With its bold claim to offer the \u201Ckeys\u201D to understanding the Bible, The Way promised its followers spiritual power, absolute truth, and a tightly structured path to salvation. But behind the promises of enlightenment and fellowship lay a system built on unquestioning obedience. Members were urged to abandon mainstream Christianity, cut ties with critics, and dedicate themselves entirely to \u201CThe Way.\u201D Leadership demanded loyalty, controlling doctrine, lifestyle choices, and even personal relationships. Former insiders describe an environment of fear, manipulation, and authoritarian oversight, all framed as divine guidance. In this episode, we trace the rise of The Way from its Midwestern roots to its peak influence in the 1970s and 80s, when it claimed tens of thousands of members across the globe. We\u2019ll examine Wierwille\u2019s controversial teachings, the movement\u2019s rigid hierarchy, and the troubling accusations of abuse and exploitation that followed. The Way International\u2019s story is a reminder of how spiritual hunger can be weaponized, turning faith into a tool of control, and how a group that begins with promises of clarity and empowerment can leave lasting wounds in the lives of those who trusted it.

      "description": "In the remote wilderness of Quebec during the late 1970s, a small group of seekers followed a man who promised salvation. His name was Roch Th\u00E9riault, a self-proclaimed prophet who mixed apocalyptic preaching with strict communal living. To his followers, he was a spiritual leader offering protection from the end of the world. To the outside world, he would become known as the mastermind behind one of the most disturbing cults in Canadian history. The Ant Hill Kids began as a commune built on ideals of simplicity and devotion, but under Th\u00E9riault\u2019s rule, it quickly descended into abuse, violence, and horror. Members were cut off from family and society, subjected to brutal punishments, and forced into medical mutilations at the hands of their leader. What started as a religious community spiraled into years of torment, leaving behind a legacy of trauma that still haunts survivors today. In this episode, we uncover how a charismatic figure could transform a group of hopeful young people into a secluded nightmare. We\u2019ll explore the rise of Roch Th\u00E9riault, the daily life of his commune, and the shocking acts that cemented the Ant Hill Kids as one of the darkest cult stories ever told.\n\nPart 1 \u2013 The Prophet in the Wilderness\nPart 2 \u2013 Gathering the Flock\nPart 3 \u2013 Building the Commune\nPart 4 \u2013 Descent into Abuse\nPart 5 \u2013 Crimes in the Shadows\nPart 6 \u2013 Collapse and Reckoning\n\nFrom silent compounds to subway attacks, from charismatic prophets to catastrophic ends, Hidden Cults is a documentary-style podcast that digs deep into the world\u0027s most extreme, elusive, and explosive fringe groups.

      "title": "Ep.19 Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God",
      "description": "In the lush hills of Uganda during the 1980s and 90s, a new religious group claimed to offer clarity in a time of social and political upheaval. Calling themselves The Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God, the leaders preached a return to strict biblical law and obedience to visions of the Virgin Mary. At its heart were promises of purity, repentance, and survival of the coming apocalypse. But what began as a community of Marian visionaries and devout followers soon spiraled into secrecy, deprivation, and control. Members were forbidden to speak, forced into silence as a form of obedience. Prophecies of the end of the world kept believers loyal, even as leaders demanded more sacrifices of land, possessions, and absolute devotion. On the eve of the year 2000, when the world was preparing to celebrate a new millennium, tragedy struck. Instead of salvation, over 700 members of the movement perished in what at first looked like a mass suicide, but soon revealed signs of something even more sinister. This episode explores how the promise of divine protection became a tool for manipulation, and how one of the deadliest cult tragedies in modern history unfolded in near silence on the global stage.\n\nPart 1 \u2013 Prophets in the Hills\nPart 2 \u2013 Building the Ark\nPart 3 \u2013 The Commandments Rewritten\nPart 4 \u2013 Countdown to the End\nPart 5 \u2013 The Fire of Kanungu\nPart 6 \u2013 Ashes and Lessons\n\nFrom silent compounds to subway attacks, from charismatic prophets to catastrophic ends, Hidden Cults is a documentary-style podcast that digs deep into the world\u0027s most extreme, elusive, and explosive fringe groups.

      "description": "It began in 1958 as a radical experiment in recovery: a storefront in Santa Monica, a handful of addicts, and a tough-talking ex-alcoholic named Charles Dederich. What started as a lifeline for people desperate to break free from addiction soon grew into a powerful movement with thousands of members, sprawling compounds, and its own strict rules of life. Synanon promised transformation through brutal honesty and communal living, but the deeper people went, the harder it became to get out. In this episode, we follow Synanon\u2019s journey from celebrated rehab innovation to infamous cult. We\u2019ll explore the confrontational \u201CGame\u201D sessions, the charismatic but authoritarian leadership of Dederich, and the gradual shift from treatment community to closed society with its own laws and punishments. By the 1970s, Synanon had turned into something darker, complete with forced sterilizations, violent enforcement, and plots against its critics. Synanon\u2019s story is not just about addiction and recovery. It\u2019s about the dangerous line between salvation and control, and how a movement built on hope could twist into coercion and fear.\n\nPart 1 \u2013 The Experiment Begins\nPart 2 \u2013 The Game\nPart 3 \u2013 The Utopia Vision\nPart 4 \u2013 The Turn to Control\nPart 5 \u2013 The Snake in the Mailbox\nPart 6 \u2013 Echoes of Synanon\n\nFrom silent compounds to subway attacks, from charismatic prophets to catastrophic ends, Hidden Cults is a documentary-style podcast that digs deep into the world\u0027s most extreme, elusive, and explosive fringe groups.

      "description": "In this episode of Hidden Cults, we turn our attention to the Unification Church, more commonly known as \u201CThe Moonies.\u201D Founded in Korea in the 1950s by Sun Myung Moon, the group grew into a global movement that promised spiritual salvation through \u201CTrue Parents\u201D but became infamous for its mass weddings, rigid hierarchy, and intense demands on followers. We explore Moon\u2019s rise from post-war Korea to international notoriety, how the movement blended Christian language with unique theology, and why it attracted both devoted believers and harsh critics. Along the way, we examine the group\u2019s vast financial empire, political connections, and the psychological toll on members caught between faith and control. The story of the Unification Church is one of devotion, manipulation, and the blurred line between religion and cult. It asks us to consider how charismatic leaders can reshape belief on a massive scale, and at what cost.

      "description": "The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, or FLDS, is one of the most secretive and controversial offshoots of Mormonism. Built on the practice of polygamy long after the mainstream church abandoned it, the FLDS created isolated communities where obedience to leaders was absolute and individuality was erased. Under the rule of Warren Jeffs, the group became synonymous with forced marriages, child brides, and an authoritarian system that demanded complete loyalty. In this episode, we trace the history of the FLDS from its 20th-century roots to its transformation into a rigid theocracy. We\u2019ll explore how its members were cut off from the outside world, how fear and devotion kept families in line, and how Jeffs rise to power ended with a dramatic downfall that exposed the inner workings of the sect. This is the story of a community built on faith, secrecy, and control, and the human cost of unquestioned devotion.\n\nPart 1 \u2013 Roots in the Desert\nPart 2 \u2013 The Prophet\u2019s Word\nPart 3 \u2013 Building the Kingdom\nPart 4 \u2013 Life Behind the Walls\nPart 5 \u2013 Cracks in the Foundation\nPart 6 \u2013 Fall of the Prophet\n\nFrom silent compounds to subway attacks, from charismatic prophets to catastrophic ends, Hidden Cults is a documentary-style podcast that digs deep into the world\u0027s most extreme, elusive, and explosive fringe groups.

      "description": "What looks like a dance collective on TikTok is, according to former members and family, something much darker. Behind the viral choreography and millions of views lies 7M Films, a management company run by Robert Shinn, a self-proclaimed pastor with a long history of spiritual control. Dancers who signed with 7M found their lives increasingly directed not just on stage, but in every personal decision, from finances and friendships to faith. Families watched their loved ones disappear into a world of rehearsals, prayers, and contracts that blurred the line between religion and business. In this episode, we trace how a Pentecostal church in Los Angeles transformed into a social media empire, why allegations of exploitation and manipulation continue to surface, and what the 7M story reveals about the rise of digital-age cults. Part 1 \u2013 Before the Spotlight Part 2 \u2013 The Rise of 7M on TikTok Part 3 \u2013 The Control Behind the Choreography Part 4 \u2013 Public Scrutiny and Investigations Part 5 \u2013 Cracks in the Facade Part 6 \u2013 Legacy, Fallout, and Cultural Impact From silent compounds to subway attacks, from charismatic prophets to catastrophic ends, Hidden Cults is a documentary-style podcast that digs deep into the world\u0027s most extreme, elusive, and explosive fringe groups.

But behind the music and missionary work was a dark legacy of manipulation, control, and widespread abuse. In this episode, we trace the rise of The Family from its hippie-era beginnings to its global spread, and examine how its teachings shattered lives across generations.

What follows is one of the most unusual and controversial new religions of the modern era. In this episode, we explore the rise of the Ra\u00EBlian Movement, a UFO-based faith that claims humanity was created by extraterrestrials known as the Elohim. Guided by their messenger Ra\u00EBl, followers embrace a future of cloning, interstellar contact, and global peace through sensual meditation.

      "description": "It started in Brooklyn as a small religious group focused on Black identity and spiritual truth. Over time, it grew into something stranger. The Nuwaubian Nation built pyramids in Georgia, talked about UFOs and lost civilizations, and claimed their leader, Dwight York, was more than just a man. He called himself a prophet, a savior, even an alien messenger. But behind all the symbols, costumes, and shifting beliefs was something far more disturbing. In this episode of Hidden Cults, we follow the rise of Dwight York and the transformation of his movement. From city storefronts to a massive compound in rural Georgia, the Nuwaubian Nation drew in thousands with its mix of mysticism, nationalism, and science fiction. What most followers didn\u2019t see was the system of control, isolation, and abuse that grew along with it. This isn\u2019t just a story about a strange cult. It\u2019s about how faith and identity can be exploited. And how the promise of truth can be used to hide the worst kinds of lies.

But behind the music and the talk of love was something darker. Something that would end in blood. In this episode of Hidden Cults, we follow the story of the Manson Family from its earliest days on the fringes of the counterculture to the horrific murders that shocked the world. We dig into how Manson built his following, what he promised, and how he convinced others to kill in his name.

In this episode of Hidden Cults, we follow the full rise and collapse of the Peoples Temple. From small-town Indiana to the remote settlement of Jonestown, this is the story of how one man\u2019s hunger for control led to one of the largest mass deaths in modern history.

In this episode of Hidden Cults, we uncover the chilling rise and fall of The Order of the Solar Temple. Founded in Europe in the late 1980s, this apocalyptic group blended New Age mysticism, Templar mythology, and conspiracy to justify its descent into control, paranoia, and fatal prophecy. From its charismatic leaders and wealthy elite followers to the carefully staged deaths across Switzerland, France, and Canada, this is the true story behind one of the most disturbing cults in modern history. We follow the timeline step by step, from obscure recruitment to coordinated group suicides cloaked in fire and secrecy. What did they believe? Why did so many die? And how did it go so far without anyone stopping it? This is not just a story of belief gone wrong. It\u0027s a warning, about power, persuasion, and what happens when salvation is used as a weapon.

      "description": "In this episode of Hidden Cults, we dive deep into the haunting story of Heaven\u2019s Gate, the first digital-age cult to orchestrate a mass suicide in the name of transcendence. Led by Marshall Applewhite and Bonnie Nettles, the group blended UFO mythology, New Age beliefs, and extreme spiritual discipline into a tightly controlled system that convinced 39 people to willingly \u0022exit their vehicles\u0022 and board a spacecraft they believed was hiding behind the Hale Bopp comet. From their early days as wandering seekers to their eerie final moments inside a California mansion, this is the full chronicle. Rituals, castrations, web design, and a promise of escape from Earth. This is not just a story of belief. It\u0027s a case study in how isolation, control, and certainty can create an alternate reality.

Led by the self-proclaimed messiah Shoko Asahara, Aum\u2019s journey from spiritual seekers to the perpetrators of the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin gas attack exposes a disturbing fusion of mind control, science fiction, and mass delusion. We unravel the cult\u2019s recruitment of elite scientists, their obsession with chemical weapons, and the twisted prophecy that led to one of the deadliest terror attacks in modern Japanese history. Survivors, defectors, and experts help us uncover the cult\u0027s hidden inner workings, and the eerie global echoes that remain today.
