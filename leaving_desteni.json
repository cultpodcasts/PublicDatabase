      "description": "Link to read the testimonies: https://leavingdesteni.wordpress.com/2024/06/27/testimonies-of-psychological-abuse-inside-the-desteni-cult/ \n\n\u0022I have received the following 3 testimonies from former members of the Desteni cult who were involved in its early days. Two of them spent time at the Desteni Farm directly interacting with Bernard Poolman (photo above) and Susan Spies. If you are considering joining Self-Perfected and purchasing TechnoTutor, these testimonies are relevant to you as well as to former and current members of these groups. Bernard Poolman was the originator of the TechnoTutor project and the mentor of the founders of TechnoTutor in North America: Katie Conklin, Cameron Cope and Avery Williams. These individuals employ many of the unethical techniques of psychological influence found in Desteni and indoctrinate recruits with the \u201Cteachings\u201D of Bernard Poolman\u0022",
