      "description": "Are there communities that support survivors of religious trauma without being\u2026religious? Spiritual abuse doesn\u2019t only happen in churches. It can happen anywhere and to anyone, but there\u2019s rarely space for all voices and experiences to be heard. I recently spoke with the four founders of the newly launched Religious Trauma Network. These four are creating a place that proves you can have a community of healing without believing the same thing\u2014and they want to help others find this for themselves. In our conversation, they each share what led them into this career, how they met, and what the Religious Trauma Network is all about. My favorite part, though? They share what healing means and how it doesn\u2019t have to look spiritual for it to be true.
