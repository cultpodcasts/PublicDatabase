A letter signed by J. Epstein sent to convicted sex offender Larry Nassar contains crude references to Trump, though the FBI has labelled it fake, and the White House emphasises the President has not been accused of any wrongdoing. The documents also include email exchanges suggesting connections between Epstein\u0027s associate Maxwell and former Prince Andrew, though he has not been charged with any crimes.\n\nSubscribe and set \uD83D\uDD14 \u00BB https://7news.link/YTSubscribe | \n\nFor the latest Australian news and breaking news alerts, connect with 7NEWS online:\nVisit \u00BB https://7news.com.au\n7Plus \u00BB https://7plus.com.au/\n7NEWS Podcast \u00BB https://open.spotify.com/user/dm9fk9hzoe68ibpttheragdgi\nFacebook \u00BB https://www.facebook.com/7NewsAustralia\nTikTok \u00BB https://www.tiktok.com/@7newsaustralia\nInstagram \u00BB https://www.instagram.com/7newsaustralia/\nX \u00BB https://x.com/7NewsAustralia\n\n7NEWS combines the trusted and powerful news brands including Sunrise, The Morning Show, Spotlight and 7NEWS.com.au, delivering unique, engaging and continuous coverage on the issues that matter most to Australians.
