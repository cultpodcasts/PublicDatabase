      "description": "Escaping A Cult, Saving His Family, Finding Faith Again \u2013 Peter Young | The David Watson Podcast What if you only realised you were in a cult after it had already destroyed your marriage, family life and sense of self? \n\nIn this episode I sit down with author and former sports broadcaster Peter Young (authopeteryoung.com) to talk about his 20\u2013year journey in and out of a tiny but devastating religious cult \u2013 led by a man his family called \u201CUncle Robert\u201D. \n\nWe talk about how it all began with love, faith and a \u201Charmless\u201D family mentor\u2026 and slowly turned into total control, brainwashing and the destruction of Peter\u2019s marriage. \n\nPeter shares how his children were taught he was \u201Cthe devil\u201D, how isolation and secrecy kept everyone trapped, and the moment a small flicker of doubt finally broke the spell. \n\nAlong the way we get into: \u2013 How Peter was slowly drawn into his wife\u2019s tiny religious cult \u2013 The red flags he missed, and why \u201Cit could never happen to me\u201D is so dangerous\n\nThe role of isolation, doubt and the \u201Cgatekeeper to God\u201D in every cult \n\nHow cult leaders twist scripture, truth and genuine problems to sell their own solutions\n\nThe impact on his kids and the painful campaign of parental alienation\n\nHow his Christian faith survived, and why he believes Jesus pulled him out\n\nMy own brush with a meditation group that turned out to be far darker than it first appeared If you\u2019ve ever thought \u201CI\u2019m too smart for a cult\u201D or wondered how ordinary, intelligent people get swept up in these groups, this conversation will challenge you. \n\nListen in for a raw, honest look at manipulation, control, faith, pain and recovery and what to watch for if you (or someone you love) is getting drawn into something that feels \u201Cjust a bit off\u201D. \n\nFind Peter Young: Website: https://authorpeteryoung.com\n\nMemoir: \u201CStop the Tall Man, Save the Tiger\u201D (cult survival and faith) Fiction series: \n\n\u201CThe Blue Team\u201D and \u201CThe Wardrobe of the Wolf\u201D (sports as a metaphor for life)",
