      "description": "Step into a world where science was rewritten, the sky was upside down, and a group of utopian believers built their own universe\u2014literally. In the swamps of Estero, Florida, a 19th-century religious movement known as the Koreshan Unity founded a community based on an unshakable belief: that we live inside the Earth. Not on it\u2014inside it.\n\nThis isn\u2019t science fiction. This is The Cellular Cosmogony, a theory dreamt up by Cyrus Teed (a.k.a. Koresh), who claimed divine revelation and sought to prove that all life existed inside a hollow sphere. His followers fled persecution, turned their backs on mainstream science, and created their own self-contained world in the Florida wilderness.\n\nIn this video, I take you deep inside the now-preserved Koreshan State Park, where remnants of their utopia still stand\u2014and so do the questions. Who were these people? What did they believe? And why has history all but buried them?\n\nThis is one of the strangest places in Florida. And that\u2019s saying something.\n\n#estero #koreshanstatepark\n\n\uD83C\uDF10 GALLIVANTER WEBSITE/BLOG.\nhttp://chadgallivanter.com\n\n\uD83D\uDCF1 SOCIAL.\nX: http://twitter.com/ChadGallivanter\nINSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/ChadGallivanter\nFACEBOOK: http://facebook.com/ChadGallivanter",
