      "description": "Aired 6/27/1995 on the Music Television network when they were going through a short-lived phase of attempting informative journalism. \n\nIn part 2, we are brought up to par on some of the inner workings of Scientiology with a cameo given by an bizarely Annie Lennox-esque John Travolta, who briefly discusses the importance of the movement. As well as former members of the Diuretics movement whom have left the idealism of the group behind, but not the inclination towards creepy haircuts. We also learn about brainwashed teens in denial and the thankless career of the professional Cult De-Programmer. ",
