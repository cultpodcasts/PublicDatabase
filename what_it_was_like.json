In this episode we talk to a woman named Beckii Jones, who once considered Belle a friend. She ran a Facebook group for mothers in the early 2010s when Belle joined and even suggested the name for her infamous app, The Whole Pantry. Beckii reflects on the woman she knew and the parts of Belle that remain a mystery. Follow our new show Scammerland. It\u0027s based on a two-part episode we did last year on What it Was Like about scammer farms and it\u0027s on Spotify , Apple and YouTube . Subscribe now! Hosted on Acast.
