When she refused, revenge was swift.\n\nThe  FBI put out a public service announcement in September 2023 warning of violent online groups including 764, 676, CVLT, Court, Kaskar, Harm Nation, Leak Society, and H3ll. At least five alleged members have been charged or jailed.\n\nOne of them is baby-faced Baby-faced 764 cult leader Bradley Cadenhead, who is just 17.
