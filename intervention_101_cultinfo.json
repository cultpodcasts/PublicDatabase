      "title": "From Deprogramming to the Intervention 101 Approach: The Evolution of Cult Interventions",
      "description": "\u0022As the knowledge base of cults, manipulation, and control has expanded, so too has the awareness that intervention is often more complex than at first it might appear. Many cult interventionists have become aware that, in addition to the manipulative and coercive tactics utilized by high control groups, there is often a mental health component that needs to be understood and addressed in order for the intervention to succeed. Our approach begins with an in-depth assessment of the family system to evaluate whether intervention is appropriate at a particular time, what part of family dynamics might be contributing to the situation, and who in the family could be helpful during intervention. For all of these reasons we have found it valuable to collaborate with a mental health professional for a more comprehensive understanding of the overall picture. This talk will explore the development of our family-centered, non-confrontational, respectful approach to understand and effectively respond to the complexity of a loved one\u2019s cult involvement. Vignettes from our cases will be presented to illustrate how this collaboration has enhanced our effectiveness as cult interventionists.\u0022\n\n\u200BCultMediation.com \nIntervention101.com  how to effectively respond to the complexity of a loved one\u0027s cult involvement.\n\nCultRecovery101.com renewing individual choice.\n\nCults101.org resources, book reviews and links.\n\nCultNews101.com news, links, resources.\n\nCultNews101 (on Facebook)\n\nCultNews101 (on Twitter)",

      "description": "Cognitive therapy is similar to religious conversion in that both are associated with changes in a person\u0027s fundamental assumptions about the world, self, and others. These fundamental assumptions derive in large part from experience, rather than rational deliberation. In some conversions powerful inner experiences, whether manipulated (\u0022outer generated\u0022) or not (\u0022inner generated\u0022), may cause a person to adopt new fundamental assumptions. Sometimes, a new set of experiences can cause a convert to reject the new assumptions and leave the group. The resulting disillusionment may cause serious adjustment problems. The impact and implications of inner experiences should be considered when trying to help former group members.",

Langone, Ph.D. Discussants: William Goldberg, M.S.W., L.C.S.W.; Patrick Ryan\nThis session will examine conversion in general and conversion to cultic belief systems specifically. Conversion will be conceptualized as a shift in worldview that results in a person\u2019s looking at self, world, and relationships in different ways. The challenge for families and friends of people who have experienced cultic conversions is to understand the convert\u2019s new worldview and to communicate with him/her accordingly. Such \u201Ccross-cultural communication\u201D is vital to enhancing the relationship with the cult-involved loved one and to finding ways to lessen conflict.",
