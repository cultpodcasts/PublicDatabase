      "description": "We\u2019ve been talking about cults and how they\u2019re covered in the media. Back in 2021, we looked at the HBO documentary series \u201CThe Way Down: God, Greed and the Cult of Gwen Shamblin\u201D on a couple of episodes. It is about a crazy, scary religious cult. This week, Mike\u2019s under the weather, and we haven\u2019t had a chance to record, so this seems like a good time to present these episodes again as one. As a refresher, here\u2019s the description of the doc series, \u201CFollows the Remnant Fellowship Church, exploring the fame and power of its leader Gwen Shambling Lara as a diet guru and church leader, and the truth behind her carefully-curated image, detailing the church\u0027s controversial practices.\u201D Join our Discord for free at goodcompanydiscord.com!

      "description": "The founder of the biggest YouTube skateboarding channel is a Scientologist. Has that fact become public, explaining the channel\u0027s drop in popularity over the past few years? Was it the money he spent climbing the rungs of this cult (and not on his skaters and staff)? Or was it just the normal life cycle of a YouTube channel? Rather than reviewing a documentary, this time we\u2019re examining the handling of this story through several YouTube explainers and exposes. What do these have in common with real docs? Do we get any closer to understanding what happened with Aaron Kyro and Braille Skateboarding?

The HBO documentary Going Clear is one of the most recognizable documentaries about the Church of Scientology. Celebrities like Tom Cruise have deep ties to this cult that was founded by prolific author, L. Ron Hubbard. \n\nSome interesting aspects of this belief system are the need to pay huge sums of money to advance to higher levels of the organization and the fact that many aspects are not even explained to members until they have reached specific levels. \n\nFor all its focus on mental health, are believers actually involved in activities that support good mental health? \n\nJoin our Discord for free at goodcompanydiscord.com!\n\nCheck out our gym (Third Street Barbell) at ThirdStreetBarbell.com https://www.thirdstreetbarbell.com/ and subscribe for updates about our apparel line at goodcompanyapparel.com https://3sb.co/!

      "description": "In this episode, we discuss the final chapters of The Way Down. These episodes cover the impact on the lives and families of the cult surrounding the Remnant Fellowship and diet guru Gwen Shamblin Lara. Many former members detail the extent to which the cult controlled their behavior and actions, and their struggle to get free of its grip. \n\nCheck out this article for some good coverage of the issues around leaving a cult.\n\nQuick recap of the series:\n\nThe author of the bestselling diet book The Weigh Down, Gwen Shamblin, appeared on the national TV talk shows and sold her weight loss philosophy to people across America. Especially churchgoers. By 1999, she had essentially started her own Tennessee church (or cult depending on your point of view). Her background as a nutritionist brought some actual common sense to the diet, but when she put herself forward as a prophet who equated devotion to diet as devotion to God she stepped into dangerous and manipulative territory. \n\nWatch the trailer for The Way Down: God, Greed and the Cult of Gwen Shamblin here.\n\n____\nCheck out our gym (Third Street Barbell) at ThirdStreetBarbell.com and subscribe for updates about our apparel line at 3sb.co!

      "description": "The author of the bestselling diet book The Weigh Down, Gwen Shamblin, appeared on the national TV talk shows and sold her weight loss philosophy to people across America. Especially churchgoers. By 1999, she had essentially started her own Tennessee church (or cult depending on your point of view). Her background as a nutritionist brought some actual common sense to the diet, but when she put herself forward as a prophet who equated devotion to diet as devotion to God she stepped into dangerous and manipulative territory. \n\nWe take a close look at part one of the five-part HBO Max docu-series about this religious diet cult and discuss how elements of popular diet movements leave participants open to being controlled and taken advantage of. Why are people so eager to believe? Why do some diet gurus make a heel turn into being cult leaders? And what qualifies as a cult anyway? \n\nWatch the trailer for The Way Down: God, Greed and the Cult of Gwen Shamblin here.\n\nCheck out our gym (Third Street Barbell) at ThirdStreetBarbell.com and subscribe for updates about our apparel line at 3sb.co!
