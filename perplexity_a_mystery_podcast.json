      "description": "In March of this year, I dove deep into the Satanic Panic, or so I thought. I left that week thinking the Satanic Panic was nothing more than a baseless moral panic, one that ended up ruining the lives of many innocent adults, and brainwashing children into having false memories, thinking they had suffered horrific abuse. But what if I told you that yes, while all of that is still true, there were others during that time hiding in the shadows, doing the very things people during the panic feared? And\u2026 what if I told you they may have had help from some of the most powerful people in the world? Today, we will be exploring one of the most unsettling mysteries of the 80s, and chilling ties to the Central Intelligence Agency. This is the story of The Finders.
