      "description": "In this episode of The Man in the Back Podcast, I sit down with Patrick\u2014two years sober, a SOAR alum, and a powerful example of practicing being the observer (the man in the back). \n\nPatrick grew up in Alaska in a religious cult called The Move, living off the grid with no electricity or running water until the age of 21. After leaving, he turned to alcohol and marijuana, chasing the \u201Cshoulder drop\u201D that once felt like peace and even felt like God.\n\nWe talk about his recovery journey, becoming the man in the back\u2014the observer of his thoughts\u2014and learning how to capture the mind of Christ through presence. Patrick shares how replacing substances with daily spiritual practice has completely changed his life, and how getting present is the key to living intentionally and free.\n\nThis conversation goes deep into recovery, faith, and what it really means to use God instead of drugs.",
