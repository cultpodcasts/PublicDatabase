      "description": "Watch as False Teacher Kenneth Copeland becomes demon possessed right on stage at a convention in Canada.\nBefore you comment read this:\nIf anyone speaks in a tongue, it should be by two or at the most three, and each in turn, and one must interpret;\n\u2014 1 Corinthians 14:27\nPlease refrain from using foul language in the comment section. We all agree that Copeland is creepy and sick. I would just ask to keep the language to a PG Rating...\nThank you.",
