Nothing discussed should be considered legal advice, nor does participation create an attorney-client relationship.\n\n#ScientologySurvivor #NoMoreKidsInScientology #ReligiousAbuseAwareness #LegalRights #SurvivorSupport #ChildhoodAbuse #CaliforniaLaw #TraumaInformedLaw",

      "description": "Title: The Weight of Innocence: Children Are Not Miniature Adults\r\n\r\nIn the bewildering landscape of Scientology, one recurring fallacy reigns supreme - the notion that children are just miniature adults. This fundamental misunderstanding underpins the cult\u0027s dark practices and serves as the rationale for the unconscionable choices made by its members. It\u0027s essential to underscore that minors cannot give informed consent to the practices the adults in Scientology willingly subject themselves to.\r\n\r\nThe cult\u0027s predictable programming extends to the children who are raised within its confines. In their distorted worldview, children are expected to mirror the behavior of the adults, partaking in practices that would be unimaginable in a rational society. This notion that they are simply \u0022small adults\u0022 leads to an unfathomable cascade of injustices.\r\n\r\nYet, this framework fails to recognize a fundamental truth \u2013 children are not miniature adults. Their innocence, vulnerability, and lack of life experience distinguish them as a unique category deserving of utmost protection. It is a sardonic twist of fate that within Scientology, this very innocence is exploited, their consent assumed in a world where their voices are overpowered by those who should know better.\r\n\r\nToday, we raise our voices in protest, echoing the imperative that children are not miniaturized versions of adults. They cannot, by any moral or ethical standard, give informed consent to the absurdities of Scientology. It is a clarion call for change, a demand for a reevaluation of values, and a plea for the protection of the most vulnerable among us. For children are not miniature adults, but bearers of innocence, worthy of our utmost care and safeguarding.\r\n\r\n#Protest #ChildTraffickingMustStop",

They\u0027ve got some fantastic sponsors, including the state of Florida, the IRS, the Clearwater police, the Tampa Bay Times, and even VICE \u0022news\u0022. \r\n\r\nHow can we forget VICE News, who did such a marvelous job by not bothering to delve into the nitty-gritty of the subject matter? \r\n\r\nYou see, Rathbun plays circles around the reporter, and it\u0027s like watching a cat chase its own tail, but without the charm.\r\n\r\nAnd you know what\u0027s the icing on this delightful cake? It\u0027s all to have clout on their \u0022YouTube videos\u0022 They\u0027re not only rich in content but also raking in the big bucks, with over 1.1 million views. \r\n\r\nBut fear not, for none of this fortune is spent on such trivial matters as real investigations into any of Rathbun\u0027s activities. \r\n\r\nWhy would anyone do that when they can grift their way to the bank?\r\n\r\nThis is yet another nauseating episode of sarcasm and utter disbelief. \r\n\r\nWelcome to the wondrous world of Rathbun and the media, where reality is just a suggestion, and profit is the name of their game - with KIDS being stuck footing the bill of their depravity or reckless negligence. \r\n\r\n#MediaManipulations #AbuseInScientology #CorporateMedia #UnhingedExecutives #CPTSDRecovery #ExposingRathbun",

An abysmal focus on trivial matters and filled with \u0022altered importances\u0022 all in an effort to misdirect the attention from defenseless kids stuck inside hotels where they face clear and present danger on a daily basis. \r\n\r\nThe US was already investigating the record of criminal operations all under the guidance of indicted and convicted in absentia felon that was on the \u0022run\u0022 L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of the child trafficking scam known as Scientology. \r\n\r\nAnd what happened next? After this segment came out? \r\n\r\nWell, the Toronto offices of Scientology got raided, and some members were convicted for breach of public trust. \r\n\r\nBut who needs to remember all that when we can discuss the latest celebrity gossip, right?\r\n\r\nIt\u0027s as if the corporate media has bestowed upon Scientology a false sense of legitimacy, allowing them to operate all the child trafficking ways without a shred of restraint much less accountability. \r\n\r\nIt\u0027s high time to call out these corrupt enablers and remind them of their duty to real journalism and investigative reporting. \r\n\r\nScientology\u0027s past and present are rife with criminal child abuse controversies, and it\u0027s time for the media to refocus on what actually truly matters instead of chasing their own tail PLAYING DUMB to the detriment of KIDS no LESS. \r\n\r\n#CorporateMedia #ScientologyInvestigation #RealJournalism #CallOutCorruption #Enablers",

      "description": "Roses are Red \r\nViolets are Blue\r\nAbusing Kids Makes US MAD AS HELL \r\nAnd its should also make you feel that way TOO \r\n\r\nIn this candid and crucial conversation with @pokemanandcults, we delve into the complex dynamics surrounding the telling of victims\u0027 stories and experiences, particularly those that occurred during their childhood. \r\n\r\nAdvocacy for kid survivors that have had to find their voice despite a lifetime of being constrained by a status quo that only served to facilitate their oppressors and corruption. Authenticity is the path to healing and advocacy, and survivors are breaking free from the confines that once held them back.\r\n\r\nWhile our lives today are filled with happiness and support from incredible groups and unwavering love, it\u0027s essential to acknowledge that discussing highly triggering subjects, such as horrific child abuse, can elicit intense emotions, including anger. \r\n\r\nIt\u0027s important to remember that anger is not a negative emotion; it\u0027s the very thing that propelled us and many other victims of childhood abuse out of denial and towards truth and justice.\r\n\r\nOur question echoes loudly: \r\n\r\nWhy is there such a profound lack of outrage from the Scientology parents about the atrocities committed against children, both in the past and, alarmingly, in the present? \r\n\r\nHow is this lack of outrage actively contributing to a culture of state sponsored child abuse? \r\n\r\nThe silence? Oh, it\u0027s just so astonishingly deafening that it must be echoing in a parallel universe. And isn\u0027t it absolutely ludicrous how, after all this time, Scientology parents as a collective haven\u0027t quite managed to grasp the concept of accountability for their active complicity, enthusiastic endorsement, and their undeniable roles in subjecting underage kids to the hotel horrors of their so-called \u0022Scientology\u0022?\r\n\r\nOf course, we mustn\u0027t forget that Scientology, that bastion of enlightenment, could only **at best** be an exclusive club for ADULTS ONLY, aged 21 and above. \r\n\r\nBecause clearly, the complex world of data mining and laundering self admitted felonies aka practicing law without a license coupled with advanced alien teachings and galactic conspiracies is far too profound for those under the age of 21 to comprehend - much less be able to given informed consent to. \r\n\r\nML,\r\nKids Trafficked By Scientology\r\n\r\n#SurvivorStories #Advocacy #Authenticity #HealingJourney #ChildAbuse #Accountability #BreakingSilence #EndTheSilence",

      "description": "\u0022We need your help, every single dollar that we raise is going to go towards building software tools so that kids being abused today will someday have the chance to just be kids,\u0022 explained Ashton Kutcher. \r\n\r\nIt\u0027s truly a noble cause, isn\u0027t it? Here\u0027s a man who appears to be passionately advocating for the protection of children, claiming to have met countless victims of sexual abuse, and expressing deep empathy for their heartbreaking experiences. What a commendable stance to take!\r\n\r\nBut wait, let\u0027s take a closer look at the perplexing paradox that is Ashton Kutcher\u0027s involvement. While he champions the cause of abused children, he\u0027s also known to have had a front-row seat to the inner workings of the Celebrity Centre and the Manor Hotel, both owned and operated by the Church of Scientology. These institutions, as we well know, have a less-than-stellar track record when it comes to appropriate interactions with minors - speaking from first hand experience. \r\n\r\nTo add to the puzzlement, Kutcher\u0027s best buddy, Danny Masterson, stands as a convicted serial rapist. Astonishingly, Kutcher has publicly extolled Masterson\u0027s moral character post his conviction. It begs the question: How can one advocate for victims of sexual abuse on one hand, and on the other, support a convicted serial rapist who was a so called \u0022close\u0022 friend?\r\n\r\nAnd then there\u0027s the matter of Kutcher\u0027s role as the chairman of the board of the Thorne organization \u2013 a multi-million-dollar 501(c) organization supposedly committed to combating child abuse. One can\u0027t help but wonder how these connections align. Thorne, after all, has actively sought substantial funding from Congress, but its leadership appears to be in the hands of someone so astonishingly tone-deaf that it boggles the mind especially when the so called \u0022chairman of the board\u0022 of over a decade \u0022steps down\u0022 when this facade is brought to question - why step down when he could so easily STEP UP? \r\n\r\nWhen are any of these 501(c) organizations ever going to experience any real transparency about what they are actually doing? It seems like a perpetual cycle of rhetoric without accountability, a grand performance without substance. \r\n\r\n It\u0027s giving \u0022saying one thing and doing another\u0022 \r\n\r\nPerhaps it\u0027s time for some real soul-searching and consistency in your actions and affiliations.\r\n\r\nJoin us with @nocultyvibes as we delve into the weeds of the shady world of 501(c) so-called child protection organizations that seem to not be making a shred of sense.\r\n\r\n#ChildProtection #Advocacy #Hypocrisy #ChildAbuse #AshtonKutcher #DannyMasterson #ThorneOrganization #Transparency #RhetoricWithoutAccountability #NoCultVibes",

      "description": "Statement: \r\nToday, we bear witness to a bewildering hypocrisy within the world of Scientology \u2013 a so-called \u0022belief system\u0022 that, on one hand, encourages its members to divulge their deepest secrets and actively self-incriminate through what they dub as \u0022security checks.\u0022 \r\n\r\nYet, on the other hand,  they are advising their \u0022in-good-standing\u0022 member, convicted felon Danny Masterson, to consider invoking the fifth amendment in his impending legal battles, including a civil trial where he stands accused of harassing and intimidating the Jane Does from his criminal trial.\r\n\r\nThis perplexing contradiction raises an array of questions that demand unequivocal answers.\r\n\r\nWithin the confines of Scientology the memos written by convicted indicted felon L Ron Hubbard delve deeply into the lives of its paying members. \r\n\r\nThese individuals are urged, even coerced and including but not limited to even pay to submit themselves to highly invasive \u0022sessions\u0022 that pry into them fully and unequivocally incriminating themselves. \r\n\r\nThese sessions unequivocally lead to admissions of serious criminal offenses, including but not limited to class A felonies. Astonishingly, these so called \u0022audit sessions/sec checks\u0022  are meticulously video recorded and contemporaneously transcribed, all within the confines of converted hotel rooms.\r\n\r\nIt\u0027s essential to note that these highly irregular, pseudo self-incriminating, and potentially illegal depositions are often conducted by individuals, including minors, who have been groomed to effectively serve as interrogators for including but not limited to self admited FELONS. \r\n\r\nThey are, in essence, fully expected and charged with the responsibility of extracting all the self incriminating highly damning information \r\n\r\nScientology has thrived on this unthinkable practice, which utilizes and exposes minors to both side of the role play as \u0022auditor\u0022 and \u0022pc\u0022 (i.e DOM/SUB without ability to set a shred of boundary) all while monetizing and data mining the admissions obtained through these rough sessions. \r\n\r\nThe organization has wholeheartedly endorsed self-incrimination,  celebrating the vulnerability of its members as a means to secure control and financial gain.\r\n\r\nYet once Scientology itself is placed under any legal scrutiny or called to answer for its actions, it appears they have no qualms about resorting to the fifth amendment \u2013 a legal safeguard designed to protect individuals from self-incrimination.\r\n\r\nThis glaring incongruity raises serious doubts about the organization\u0027s integrity and motives. How can they simultaneously champion the pursuit of truth through admissions, only to invoke silence when faced with their own accountability? \r\n\r\nThe hypocrisy is staggering and speaks to their willingness to play dumb to manipulate all angles stretching them beyond the point of utter absurdity. \r\n\r\nScientology\u0027s security checks stand exposed for what they truly are \u2013 a tool to extract self-incriminating information from their members, all while profiting from their vulnerabilities. \r\n\r\nAnd today as they are faced with their own responsibility, they hypocritically employ the very tactic they\u0027ve long criticized in others.\r\n\r\nThis double standard is not just astounding; it is deeply troubling. \r\n\r\nAs we advocate for justice, it\u0027s high time to confront this contradiction head-on. \r\n\r\nY\u0027all cant have it all way every way anyway that is just ridiculous and makes a true mockery of the entire \u0022legal process\u0022\r\n\r\nTherefor we demand genuine transparency and accountability, for no one, including Scientology, should be above the law.\r\n\r\nKids Of Scientology \r\n\r\n#Hypocrisy #Scientology #LegalContradictions #PleadTheFifth #Transparency #Justice #Openness",

How can Marisol Nichols, who has been intimately affiliated with an organization that specializes in child abuse and exploitation at an industrial scale, engage in a seemingly friendly conversation with law enforcement about combatting trafficking?\r\n\r\nLieutenant Mark Evans, the officer in charge of human trafficking, vice, and counterterrorism for the Los Angeles Police Department, boasts about his two-decades plus career and \u0022over 4000\u002B\u0022  investigations. \r\n\r\nHowever, the stark absence of any investigations into the trafficking of kids into Scientology hotels, an organization with which Marisol Nichols is financially associated, raises glaring questions - that apparently only we seem to be asking. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Lieutenant Evans has authored a book titled \u0022Selling the Daughters of America,\u0022 delving into the skills of traffickers and the harrowing world of their victims. Yet, this book somehow overlooks the skills of the traffickers involved in Scientology\u0027s operation.\r\n\r\nWe, the Kids of Scientology, find it deeply troubling that such discussions and affiliations take place without any acknowledgment of the real issues at hand. As survivors of an environment rife with manipulation, abuse, and exploitation, we believe it is crucial to shine a light on this stark contrast between words and actions. \r\n\r\nWe call for accountability, transparency, and a genuine commitment to combating child trafficking, even when it hits uncomfortably \u0022close to home\u0022. \r\n\r\nIt\u0027s time for a deeper examination of these connections and a thorough investigation into the allegations surrounding Scientology.\r\n\r\nIn unity and defiance,\r\nKids of Scientology\r\n\r\ncc: @FBI \u002B @latimes \r\n\r\n#HypocrisyExposed #ChildTrafficking #ScientologyScandal #MarisolNichols #LAPD #HumanTrafficking #SurvivorStories #KidsOfScientology #AccountabilityNow #EndChildExploitation #TransparencyMatters #JusticeForSurvivors #TraffickingAwareness #ChildrensRights #ExploitationExposed",

Rebecca\u0027s work aligns with our mission to advocate for the rights and safety of children who are victims of trafficking stuck inside Scientology hotels.\r\n\r\nWe salute her dedication and contributions shining light into the actual problem this crime creates and how it\u0027s not as mysterious as everyone is out there pitching it is - we hope to continue raising awareness and working towards a world where no child falls victim to trafficking including but not limited to these hotels.\r\n\r\nTogether, we MUST make a difference because in this year 2023 we have not a shred of patience for more willful blindness and stupidity that affects the kids, current kids that are being affected by the scourge of what AMERICA IS ALL ABOUT SANCTIONING AND ENABLING child slaves at an industrial size scale.\r\n\r\nWhat in the literal hell is actually going on? is what we are asking ourselves right about now - why is everyone in Florida and California so numb and apathetic when it comes to helping kids?\r\n\r\nIt\u0027s pathetic to be honest - and we cant wait to hear y\u0027all feedback on what we will all learn today listening to Mrs Bender. \r\n\r\nML,\r\nKids of Scientology\r\n\r\n#HumanTrafficking #ChildTrafficking #ChildSafety #SurvivorAdvocacy #RebeccaBender #KidsOfScientology #EndHumanTrafficking #JusticeForVictims",

      "description": "cc: @hollywoodreporter  \nBackground: \r\nIn our upcoming discussion, we will delve even deeper into the concerning incongruities surrounding Ashton Kutcher, who not too long ago made the unthinkable decision to \u0022step down\u0022 as the chairman of the board for  his personal 501c multi-million \u0022Tech Bro backed\u0022 child trafficking organization @Thorn, and his wife, Mila Kunis, who apparently also was on the board and stepped down from her  role of an \u0022observer on the @Thorn board. \r\n\r\nWe\u0027ll explore past interview with Craig Killborn interviews a young 17 year old Mila Kunis who openly blatantly admitted to lying about her age without a shred of remorse, just so she could secure a role in Hollywood the now infamous and controversial  \u0022That \u002770s Show,\u0022 where inappropriate situations arose as a result of this egregious lie that apparently no one in the set of that show had a shred of a problem with. \r\n\r\nThese revelations raise serious questions about the ethical business practices employed by both Hollywood and Scientology - who seem comfortable sharing very shady AF \u0022business practices\u0022 - one hides under so called \u0022making art\u0022 so \u0022anything goes\u0022 without a shred of guardrails or common sense seems to be the way they \u0022go\u0022 \r\n\r\nThe other child abuse exposure scam hinges on America having a so called \u0022freedom of religion\u0022 where apparently also allows for all \u0022laws\u0022 of trafficking of kids to become paralyzed and toothless where \u0022anything goes\u0022 would go even further as they took it upon themselves to redefine kids as \u0022adults in small bodies\u0022. \r\n\r\nIt\u0027s alarming that while Hollywood allows underage individuals, including but not limited to as young as 14, to partake in inappropriate roles with adults, Scientology takes it a step further by exploiting children of the same age by turning said kids into actual \u0022slaves\u0022 all the while subjecting them to similarly unsuitable circumstances including but not limited to systemically tapping underage kids to launder self admitted class A felonies after completing a 2 week course inside a \u0022hotel\u0022 the so called \u0022Celebrity Center\u0022 \r\n\r\nThis stark contrast between their public image and their actions calls into question the credibility of both Hollywood and Scientology in addressing the very issues they claim to really \u0022combat\u0022 - trafficking and slaving of KIDS \r\n\r\nOur question is simple: \r\n\r\nIn what world is anyone combating anything that they themselves are participating in breaking the literal toothless weak AF \u0022laws\u0022 that we dont seem to ever be able to have anyone around willing to enforce? \r\n\r\nWhile Mila and Ashton both held those important AF \u0022positions\u0022 on the multi million dollar 501c @Thorn - they chose to step \u0022down\u0022 - instead of stepping up to really \u0022fix the crisis\u0022 of having shredded their credibility. A self inflicted WOUND they took it upon themselves to have their \u0022credibility\u0022 utterly REKT all by themselves . \r\n\r\nOne really has to ask himself in what literal world - or better in what country  does that make a shred of sense? \r\n\r\nIn the United States Of America. A country that from one side of its mouth or \u0022constitution\u0022 purports to have \u0022abolished\u0022 slavery all the while in the actual physical universe today not only supports but fully enables and SPONSORS IT - SYSTEMIC ENSLAVEMENT OF MINORS NO LESS. \r\n\r\nWe will explore why these two who are really all over the public record displaying they are not pressed about lying or having highly questionable practices scrutinized in any real way - as they receiving millions of dollars to so call combat trafficking of minors. \r\n\r\nAll the while the Kutchers themselves appear to be actively involved in activities that contribute and add  to the problem they are fighting? \r\n\r\nHow does that work exactly? \r\n\r\nThe incongruities in their actions and public stances raise legitimate concerns, and we\u0027ll be examining why these concerns are not more widely addressed by the  corporate media who are pretending the apology video was so bad - but now that TIME magazine said they were stepping \u0022down\u0022 from @Thorn is all literally GUCCI and they are just waiting for the water to go under the \u0022bridge\u0022 \r\n\r\nWhat is the literal truth behind these troubling AF discrepancies? \r\n\r\n What in the literal hell is going on, indeed?\r\n\r\n@Thorn \u0022leadership\u0022 - Please advice ASAP!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nKids Of Scientology \n\n\r\n\r\n#ChildTrafficking #HumanTrafficking #ChildAbuse #Hollywood #Scientology #AshtonKutcher #MilaKunis #TraffickingSurvivors #CorporateMedia #Incongruities #Transparency #Accountability #Credibility #EthicalPractices #MediaCoverage #TruthUnveiled #ProtectOurChildren #ChildSafety #Advocacy #EndChildTrafficking",

      "description": "Background: \r\n\r\nIn this inaugural episode of \u0022Scientology, Kids Unite,\u0022 we are honored to introduce you to our dear friend, Katrina Reyes. Katrina\u0027s journey is one of remarkable resilience and strength, a testament to the indomitable human spirit.\r\n\r\nBorn in Siberia, Russia, Katrina\u0027s life took an unimaginable turn when, at just 11 years old Sea Org so callled \u0022recruiters\u0022 were sent on \u0022a mission\u0022 by Debbie Cook and Lori Engelheart (spelling?) to get as many people and \u0022kids\u0022 as they could to sign sham billion year literal \u0022child trafficking\u0022 ridiculous contracts. \r\n\r\nKatrina\u0027s story is a harrowing example of how multi-generational involvement in Scientology led her into a life she never chose. She\u0027s a third-generation Scientologist, with her grandmother being the first to become entangled in this web. \r\n\r\nHer grandmother\u0027s journey began with Herbalife in Russia, and it took a sharp turn when she attended a conference in Florida and was recruited into to work at Scientology Fort Harrison hotel and later posted as the \u0022Flag Consultant\u0022 in Moscow Russia effectively as a \u0022Russian recruiter\u0022  \r\n\r\nKatrina\u0027s grandmother then encouraged Katrina\u0027s mother to join \u0022the Sea organization\u0022, continuing the family\u0027s involvement. \r\n\r\nThe Moscow consulate played a pivotal role in facilitating R1 and R2 visas for Katrina, allowing her to be trafficked into America at just 11 years old.\r\n\r\nKatrina\u0027s situation took a disturbing turn when her R2 visa was upgraded to an R1, thanks to the efforts of Glen Stylo\u0027s office at the Office of Special Affairs in Florida all so she could start to \u0022work\u0022.\r\n\r\nThis visa change effectively bound Katrina to a life of unthinkable tasks and literal \u0022labor\u0022\r\n\r\nDespite her youth, she was tasked with the unimaginable responsibility of caring for adults who had paid to undergo interrogations so called \u0022Sec check\u0022 to get to the \u0022OT Eligibility \u0022 - the literal point of no-return of KGB type \u0022kompormat\u0022 the organization data mines to ensure they truly trust you to upgrade your \u0022level\u0022\r\n\r\nShe had to tend to their needs, ensuring they were well-rested, provided with vitamins, and comfortable and cozy so they could really pay a ton of money for what all adults inside those hotels are all about and \u0022into\u0022.\r\n\r\nKatrina\u0027s story sheds light on the shocking realities of life inside Scientology, where children like her were thrust into roles they were never meant to play. Her experiences underscore the urgent need for change within these organizations that continue to exploit individuals across generations. \r\n\r\nMy connection with Katrina dates back to when we were both kids, as she became my student during that horrific tumultuous period of our formative years.  \r\n\r\nHer story encapsulates the arduous journey of a every child trafficking kid survivor of these American sanctioned \u0022hotels\u0022 \r\n\r\nOur journeys to recover have beee marked by numerous setbacks and potholes along the path the way. \r\n\r\nHowever, today, we stand on the other side of those trials, ready to share our experiences, reflect on our healing processes, and advocate fervently for the children who remain trapped within those very same hotels.\r\n\r\nPlease join us as we warmly welcome our remarkable friend, Katrina Reyes, and together, let\u0027s hold space for her inspiring story of grace and strength. \r\n\r\nAs a tribute to Katrina, I want to include this poem dedicated to her: \r\n\r\nIn the darkest of nights, she found her way,\r\nFrom Siberian cold to an even colder Tampa Bay.\r\nAt just eleven, her life took a spin,\r\nInto the world of Scientology, trapped within.\r\nThe billion year contract \r\nWas just LEGAL SPIN \r\nSetting up every single shred of child to loose \r\nand not to \u0022win\u0022 \r\n\r\nKatrina a survivor so bold,\r\nThrough the harshest of journeys, her story fully unfolds.\r\nFrom Clearwater\u0027s confines, she emerged with grace,\r\nToday a beacon of hope for all those kids that have been left  in that rotten place.\r\nIts reality what is about to be REPLACED\r\n\r\nWith courage unyielding, she fought for her light,\r\nIn the face of the shadows, she stood up and asked a simple question:\r\nWhat is it about this that is not RIGHT? \r\nFrom pain and from trauma, she\u0027s risen above,\r\nA symbol of strength, a testament of true uncoditional love.\r\n\r\nSo, let\u0027s stand together, hand in hand we unite,\r\nFor the kids who still suffer, in their desperate plight.\r\n\r\nWith Katrina to guide us, we\u0027ll work to set free,\r\nThe children entrapped, just like you and me.\r\n\r\nKids of Scientology \r\n\r\n#SurvivorStories #ChildTrafficking #ScientologySurvivor #EndHumanTrafficking #KatrinaReyes #BreakTheSilence #RecoveryJourney #SurvivorsUnite #FightingForFreedom #ChildhoodLost #HopeAndStrength #SpeakOut #EndAbuse #FreeTheKids #TogetherWeRise #JusticeForAll #HealingJourney #VoicesMatter #KatrinaStrong #BehindClosedDoors #AdvocateForChange",

Her attempt to divert attention by creating a video on \u0022stuffing a pepper\u0022 is emblematic of a much larger problem \u2013 the deliberate and calculated distraction from the horrifying truths hidden within the walls of Scientology and Hollywood.\r\n\r\nLaura Prepon once alleged to have distanced herself from Scientology, now conveniently overlooks the atrocities that she witnessed as a \u0022paid member\u0022 os Scientology hotels from hell. \r\n\r\nThe abuse, the systemic and institutional exploitation and unimaginable suffering of minors so called \u0022kids in adult bodies\u0022 \u2013  are all met with a resounding silence from those who literally know way better.\r\n\r\nIn this unapologetic conversation, we are here to call out Scientology and Hollywood for their roles in perpetuating these horrors.

For far too long, America has blindly embraced an indicted, convicted felon and bestowed upon him a status he does not deserve. This man normalized the systemic, institutionalized abuse of innocent children, all meticulously documented within the horrifying confines of Scientology\u0027s hotels.\r\n\r\nWe must ask ourselves, in what twisted world could children possibly be helped by subjecting them to unthinkable levels of torture and cruelty? It is a question that demands an immediate and unequivocal answer from the United States government, and we cannot afford to wait any longer.\r\n\r\nThe half-baked narratives driven by betrayal blindness have been used to justify the abominable actions of a man, L. Ron Hubbard, who turned the lives of countless children into a nightmarish circus of torment. His creation of fanciful costumes and grandiose fantasies served only to mask the stark reality that these individuals were nothing more than manipulative charlatans who betrayed the trust of innocent kids.\r\n\r\nWe refuse to carry the burden of this stupidity any longer. In the year 2023, it is incumbent upon us to rise above the shadows of ignorance and complacency, and confront the grim truth that betrayal blindness has enabled far too much pain and suffering within Scientology. It\u0027s time for accountability, it\u0027s time for justice, and it\u0027s time to put an end to the horrors inflicted upon these vulnerable children.\r\n\r\n#BetrayalBlindness #ChildTrafficking #Thorn #AshtonKutcher #MilaKunis #DannyMasterson #Scientology #EndAbuse #ChildRights #JusticeNow #Accountability",

      "description": "In this live discussion, we are going to do something that seems sorely lacking in the coverage of the so-called \u0022involvement of the Kutchers\u0022 with Scientology: we\u0027re going to take a brutally honest look at @60minutesAU and their rather feeble attempt to cover this deeply complex issue. It\u0027s mind-boggling that they have the audacity to present themselves as authorities on the matter when they have barely scratched the surface, relying on secondhand accounts and hearsay instead of conducting genuine investigations within the walls of Scientology\u0027s shadowy hotels.\r\n\r\nBut our critique doesn\u0027t stop there. We\u0027re also setting our sights on Tony Ortega, who has somehow managed to position himself as an expert on this subject, despite never setting foot inside a Scientology hotel, undergoing audits, or even completing a basic Scientology course. It\u0027s painfully clear that Ortega is exploiting the pain and suffering of real victims, including women and children, all while proclaiming his profound concern and care.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most egregious act was Ortega\u0027s hasty publication of the letters from Ashton and Mila Kutcher to Judge Olmedo, diverting attention away from the hard-fought justice that took the Jane Does over two decades to secure. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the epitome of opportunism.\r\n\r\nOur mission in this live discussion is to cast an unrelenting spotlight on these issues, to rip apart the thinly veiled motives behind these narratives, and to be unapologetically vocal in our defense of the rights and justice that have been denied for far too long. We won\u0027t mince words, we won\u0027t sugarcoat the truth, and we won\u0027t back down.\r\n\r\nSo, join us as we embark on this relentless and admonishing conversation. It\u0027s high time the unvarnished truth prevails, and it begins with confronting the hypocrisy and exploitation that has gone unchecked for far too long.\r\n\r\n\r\n#WTF #Scientology #AshtonKutcher #Milakunis #DannyMasterson #serialrapist #convicted #felon #60minsAU #Corruption #Justice #childtrafficking #Thorn",

We will examine whether his actions can be attributed to reckless negligence, or if there\u0027s a more sinister sense of false entitlement at play.\r\n\r\nAs we delve deep into this distressing story, we are left grappling with a fundamental question: What in the literal hell is going on within the secretive world of Scientology Hotels and Commercial buildings?\r\n\r\nWhy are so many KIDS at risk? \r\n\r\nWhy are Scientology parents exposing their literal underage kids to clear and present danger? \r\n\r\nFurthermore, we will use this story as a catalyst to raise a broader question: Are there others, living under the radar within Scientology, who are complicit in enabling and covering up such abuses? \r\n\r\nSILENCE = COMPLICITY \r\n\r\nSilence can be seen as a form of complicity in certain situations, particularly when it involves knowledge or awareness of wrongdoing or injustice. \r\n\r\nWhen individuals or groups are aware of harmful actions, unethical behavior, or injustices and choose to remain silent instead of taking action or speaking out against them, it can contribute to the perpetuation of those wrongs - and for all Kids of Scientology currently stuck inside the hotels that is what it has become. \r\n\r\nAnd all the ones that did leave are left wondering what is WRONG WITH THEM? \r\n\r\nWHY? \r\n\r\nSilence can imply consent or agreement with what is happening, and it may allow those responsible to continue their actions unchecked. \r\n\r\nIn cases of abuse, discrimination, corruption, or other harmful activities, breaking the silence by reporting, advocating, or seeking justice can be a crucial step in addressing and preventing further harm - SO WE PLEAD WITH ALL OF YOU TO THINK OF THE KIDS STUCK INSIDE THE HOTELS. \r\n\r\nIt is vitally important to recognize that there may be various reasons why individuals remain silent, including fear, coercion, or a lack of understanding of the situation. \r\n\r\nEncouraging a culture of accountability, empathy, and support can help individuals find the courage to speak out against injustice specially when it comes to the kids that dont have a shred of an advocate inside of those horrific hotels.  \r\nOur message to those within the Scientology community is clear: It\u0027s time to reclaim your power and use your voice to stop shielding enablers and abusers. \r\n\r\nBetrayal blindness is a very real phenomenon, and it\u0027s vital to break free from its grasp.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for a dedicated podcast on the subject of betrayal blindness, coming your way on Wednesday. \r\n\r\nTogether, we can expose the truth, demand accountability, and work towards a safer, more just world for all.\r\n\r\n#ChildrenofScientology #ScientologyAbuse #JulianSchwartz #BetrayalBlindness #Accountability #ExposeTheTruth #ChildSafety #HumanRights #Justice #Childtrafficking #Thorn #AshtonKutcher #DannyMasterson #Scientology #felonies #enabled",

      "description": "Statement:\r\n\r\nIn a chilling revelation, whistleblower Tara Lee Rodas has come forward to expose a deeply unsettling reality within the U.S. government\u0027s involvement in the child migrant crisis. Her testimony, delivered to the House Judiciary Committee, has sent shockwaves through our understanding of child trafficking.\r\n\r\nAs we delve into the disconcerting parallels between child trafficking within the secretive world of Scientology hotels, where systemic and institutionalized abuses took place, and the broader child migrant crisis, we are confronted with a stark question: What in the literal hell is going on?\r\n\r\nIn the wake of scandals involving Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, who were notorious for collecting blackmail material on their influential associates, it becomes abundantly clear that the U.S. government has allowed a similar operation to unfold, but on a grand and alarming scale. Dave and Shelly Miscavige, at the helm of Scientology, appear to have run a comparable operation, one that operates with a level of audacity and intensity that is truly shocking.\r\n\r\nThe implications of these revelations are profound. We must address the uncomfortable truth that elements within our government, whether knowingly or unwittingly, have acted as middlemen in a deeply disturbing web of child trafficking. It is an affront to the principles of justice, morality, and human rights upon which our nation was founded.\r\n\r\nAs we shine a light on these unsettling realities, we must demand transparency, accountability, and a thorough investigation into all allegations related to child trafficking. We cannot allow this issue to be buried or ignored any longer.\r\n\r\nOur duty to protect the vulnerable and ensure the safety and well-being of our children transcends political lines and affiliations. It is a matter of utmost urgency that we address this crisis head-on and take the necessary steps to bring those responsible to justice.\r\n\r\nThe testimonies of brave whistleblowers like Tara Lee Rodas serve as a reminder that we must confront the darkness that exists within our society, even when it implicates those in positions of power. We owe it to the victims, past and present, to seek the truth and demand justice.\r\n\r\nWe would love to hear from \u0022leadership\u0022 of @Thorn what y\u0027all are really going to do to MAKE UP THE DAMAGE of your organization horrific exploitation of our pain in the wake of your \u0022COB\u0022 Ashton Kutcher stepping down to CRISIS MANAGE INSTEAD OF STEPPING TF UP TO TAKE ACUTAL ACCOUNTABILITY   AND TRANSPARENCY. \r\n\r\nUNLESS THAT IS TOO MUCH TO ASK! \r\n\r\nML, \r\n\r\nKIDS OF SCIENTOLOGY \r\n\r\n#ChildTrafficking #Whistleblower #USGovernment #MigrantCrisis #SystemicAbuse #InstitutionalizedAbuse #Justice #Accountability #HumanRights #Thorn #nomorekidsinscientology",

\r\n\r\nThis situation also raises broader concerns about the state of affairs in Hollywood, Scientology, and all the \u0022public relations\u0022 firms who are intimately  involved charging HEAFTY AF RETAINERS FOR THEMSELVES to WIELD UNDOE INFLUENCE and pitch all manner of self made degenerates as this or that according to where the WIND AND MONEY FLOW. \r\n\r\nToday we seek a real answer to these question: \r\n\r\nWhat is the true state of affairs in the pursuit of justice and accountability including but not limited to for victims of child trafficking both by and inside of \u0022Hollywood\u0022 and \u0022Scientology\u0022? \r\n\r\nWas ADULTICIZING kids and infantilizing adults \r\n\r\nWAS THAT A GOOD MF IDEA? \r\n\r\nAs Ashton Kutcher PREDICTABLY AF  \u0022steps down\u0022 from HIS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD @Thorn,  its leaving us to ponder AF AF AF .... the effectiveness of his \u0022technology\u0022 in light of the ongoing issues surrounding his close friend Danny Masterson, we call for clarity, transparency, and accountability in addressing these concerns. \r\n\r\nAnd while we are at it we call into question the technology his guru Danny Masterson was availing himself of to purport including but not limited to CLASS A FELONIES SELF ADMITTED ONES THAT IS were all video recorded and fully chronologically transcribed all to have it \u0022floated\u0022 INSIDE A HOTEL. \r\n\r\nPerhaps that technology and @thorns can be questioned the SAME\r\n\r\nCould they two literal pods in a POD? \r\n\r\nSience we dont have a shred of a CLUE please advice @Thorn perhaps enlighten us the KIDS THAT GREW UP IN SCIENTOLOGY how y\u0027alls \u0022technology\u0022 works and why it cant find a SHRED of KID being TRAFFICKED INSIDE SCIENTOLOGY HOTELS - would really be great to know that TBH. \r\n\r\nWe will continue to monitor and raise questions where necessary to ensure that the fight against child trafficking remains an unwavering priority, free from any ambiguity or misdirection we are sick and tired of being MISDIRECTED. \r\n\r\nWE HAVE NOT A SHRED OF PATIENCE LEFT FOR ANY MORE WILFUL DISPLAYS OF STUPIDITY \r\n\r\ncc: Congress of these United States Of America \r\ncc: IRS \r\ncc: FBI \r\ncc: Department of HomeLand SECURITY\r\ncc: ICE\r\ncc: SEC \r\ncc: Mrs Harris \u0022VP\u0022 of the USA \r\n\r\nImage Laundering services provided by including but not limited to: \r\n@hollywoodreporter @tampabaytimes @latimes \r\n\r\nSo now the NFT SCAM --- Lets get into it: https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/was-ashton-kutcher-and-mila-kunis-pot-smoking-cat-show-an-nft-scam/ar-AA1gM4Cp\r\n\r\n#Hollywood #Scientology #ChildTrafficking #Accountability #WhereTheFuckIsIt?\r\n#CorruptAF #WTF #StopPlayingDumb",

This choice cannot be viewed in isolation; it has significant implications given Clearwater\u0027s notorious history as an international hub for child trafficking, including the heartbreaking experiences of minors inside Scientology luxury hotels.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this situation even more perplexing is the apparent lack of action by organizations that purport to combat child trafficking. Thorn, the Ashton Kutcher-founded non-profit, claims to support law enforcement in their efforts to protect children, but it seems that their resources have not been utilized to find and rescue kids who may still be trapped inside these Scientology-run establishments. \r\nIs this a coincidence or is its this being done on purpose? \r\n\r\nIt\u0027s a stark reminder of the alarming disconnect between the event\u0027s location and the harsh reality of child trafficking that has plagued Clearwater for years - literally decades. \r\n\r\nWe are calling upon all concerned citizens to join us in a call to action. It\u0027s time to ask the tough questions and demand answers from the FDLE and private so called \u0022child trafficking\u0022 organizations including but not limited to \u0022Thorn\u0022 from Ashton Kutcher and Marisol Nichols for A Slavery Free World as well quite frankly. \r\n\r\nAction Steps:\r\n\r\nEngage on Social Media: Visit @FDLE on Instagram and also @Thorn\u0027s social media channels. Voice your concerns and ask them why they have chosen Clearwater for this summit and what efforts are being made to rescue children from Scientology-run hotels.\r\n\r\nContact Local Representatives: Reach out to your local government representatives, state senators, and congressional representatives. Express your concerns about the FDLE\u0027s decision and the quite apparent lack of action by organizations like Thorn getting all manner of governmental funds only to come to find out not seem to be working that well in finding child trafficking at Hotels where its now disgraced had to step down co-founder \u0022Ashton Kutcher\u0022 has frequented for himself and where his BFF Danny was a paid member of. \r\n\r\nSupport Awareness Campaigns: Share this live discussion and related content on social media platforms to raise awareness. Encourage your friends and followers to join the conversation and demand transparency and real accountability. \r\n\r\nAll we ever get is people stepping DOWN and we need more people STEPPING UP than down to be honest. \r\n\r\nLet\u0027s unite our voices and efforts to hold the FDLE and organizations like Thorn accountable for their actions and inactions in the fight against child trafficking. Together, we can make a meaningful impact and ensure that no child remains trapped in the shadows of these Scientology-run hotels. \r\n\r\n#FDLE #ChildTraffickinginUSA #Clearwater #Thorn #AccountabilityMatters #StopPlayingDumb #Felonies #Scientology #ChildTraffickingAF",

      "description": "In this LIVE, we will shine a stark light on Thorn, an organization founded and led by Ashton Kutcher, ostensibly \u0022dedicated\u0022 to rescuing children from the harrowing clutches of child trafficking and sex trafficking. The very recent developments on Kutchers actions have cast a disturbing pall over this \u0022501c\u0022 organization\u0027s leadership given his close relationship of someone who was involved in funding trafficking of minors at scale inside hotels himself \u0022Danny Masterson\u0022 \r\n\r\nAshton Kutcher has not only endorsed but vigorously defended his long-time \u0022friend,\u0022 Danny Masterson\u2014a Kid that Grew Up in Scientology and a convicted serial rapist.  \r\n\r\nThe gravity of this endorsement is exacerbated by its timing: it unfolded post-conviction, while Ashton and Mila remained firmly entrenched in Masterson\u0027s inner circle.\r\n\r\nWe ardently question the narrative surrounding who reached out to Ashton and Mila. Ashton insists it was Danny\u0027s \u0022family\u0022 (as a generality) , but we raise the unsettling possibility that it might have been Scientology\u0027s Mom-ager, Carol Masterson. \r\n\r\nCould Carol, known for amassing compromising information on all of Danny\u0027s friends and close relationships over the wield any type of undue influence? \r\n\u2014 Undue influence is a malevolent tactic that is chronicled in the memos of convicted and indicted felon L. Ron Hubbard.\r\n\r\nJoin us as we fearlessly dissect the bewildering intricacies of this situation. We will be reacting to the @popcornhollywood interview with PR guru Molly McPherson and further contextualizing from our first hand experience what can not be seen below the surface of why lies behind this train wreck video - a lot more than meets the literal \u0022eyes\u0022. \r\n\r\nWe implore you to share your unfiltered thoughts, questions and opinions on this deeply disconcerting matter and who gets implicated getting the short end of the stick the kids that are supposed to be getting helped by a 501c and a CEO that could not be less compromised himself. \r\n\r\n#Thorn #AshtonKutcher #MilaKunis #AccountabilityMatters #Scientology #Childtrafficking #WhatInTheLiteralHell #Corruption #hollywood #Enablers #Blackmail #Felonies",

      "description": "Join us for a riveting session as we react to the shattered credibility of Ashton and Mila Kutcher on the wake of their \u0022letters to Judge Olmedo\u0022 advocating on behalf of Kid that Grew Up in Scientology and is now a convicted serial R*pist \u0022Danny Masterson\u0022 \r\n\r\nIn this video, we meticulously dissect the perplexing situation where they find themselves, grappling with questions of undue influence and inexplicable actions.\r\n\r\nWe delve deep into the heart of the matter, questioning the driving forces that led them to craft letters in support of a convicted serial felon, Danny Masterson. Their words were not only ill-suited but also highly inappropriate, causing a very real public uproar. \r\n\r\nWe explore their \u0022annoyance\u0022 that was on full display when these letters, penned to Judge Olmedo, were made public. The incongruity of their statements becomes striking, especially considering their sophistication in understanding a judicial system and how that system prosecutes sexual offenders fro their own \u0022anti-child S*x Slavery and abuse\u0022 charity \u0022Thor\u0022 \r\n\r\nWhy are two highly intelligent individuals defending a convicted felon with such fervor? \r\n\r\nThat\u0027s the question we aim to answer in this live discussion. \r\n\r\nWe\u0027ll be joined by @NoCultyVibes, who shares our concerns and insights. Together, we\u0027ll also investigate the role of Danny Masterson\u0027s mother, Carol Masterson, who served as his \u0022manager\u0022 from his early days as a child actor.\r\n\r\nThis live session promises to be a thought-provoking journey into the complexities of influence, celebrity, and accountability.

As we delve into these unsettling stories, we continue to analyze the cult-like dynamic that played out between two best friends, Danny and Ashton, but for all the wrong reasons AF.\r\n\r\nThe bond between these two individuals seemed unbreakable, their friendship a model of camaraderie. However, beneath the surface lurked a sinister side, one that exploited power and privilege at the expense of vulnerable individuals. Hollywood \u0022mom-ager\u0022 Scientologist Carol Masterson that was data mining her son since a very young age crossing all manner of common sense boundaries. \r\n\r\nWe uncover the grim truth behind their association and the consequences it had for those who found themselves ensnared in their Scientology web.\r\n\r\nThis video is a stark reminder of the importance of speaking out against wrongdoing and holding those responsible accountable for their actions. \r\n\r\nJoin us in this unflinching exploration of a dark chapter where Hollywood and Scientolgy are literally being married in HISTORY. \r\n\r\nSubscribe, like, and share to be part of the conversation. \r\n\r\nPlease feel free to support us as well by sending any questions you have to the instagram accounts of including but not limited to: @ClearwaterPubSafety @TampabayTimes @FDLE @LAPDHQ @LaTImes @FBI etc etc etc! \r\n\r\n**WE NEED ALL KIDS OUT OF THOSE HOTELS - REPEAT ALL KIDS NEED TO BE TAKEN OUT OF HARMS WAYS INSIDE OF WHAT IS TAKING PLACE INSIDE OF THOSE HOTELS**\r\n\r\nPS - STOP PLAYING DUMB - ITS THE YEAR 2023 ITS NOT GONNA WORK ANYMORE WHATSOEVER \r\n\r\n#ConfrontingEvil #MeToo #AccountabilityMatters #Scientology #NoMoreKidsInScientology #WTF #MakeItStop #WTH #StateSactioned",

In the aftermath of their close friend, \u0022Danny Masterson,\u0022 a Kid that Grew Up in Scientology, being convicted of FORCIBLE R*PE, Mila and Ashton Kutcher submitted letters to a judge where they expressed how they really felt.\n\nToday, we subject their statements to rigorous scrutiny.\n\nJoin us as we react to the incisive analysis by @TheBehaviourPanel\u0027s experts in body language and interrogations. We\u0027re grateful to them for providing the video for our review. As a Kid that grew up in Scientology, I was trained to interrogate adults starting at  age of 12. In this video, I\u0027ll bring my unique perspective as a Scientology child interrogator to the table.\n\nI was trained as an L. Ron Hubbard interrogator, a role that involved conducting highly disturbing extreme enhanced interrogation tactics (torture) as exactly called for by Hubbard\u0027s grotesque AF \u0022memos\u0022. \n\nThese directives from a convicted and indicted felon that America decided was some sort of \u0022American bred god\u0022  (L Ron Hubbard)  insisted that we conduct extremely through self incriminating sessions where we were made to elicit self-admissions including  class A felonies, as a means of control and power. \n\nTogether, we\u0027ll dissect the cringe-worthy apology video, probing the motivations and implications behind the Kutcher\u0027s actions. \n\nBut that\u0027s not all; we\u0027ll also turn the spotlight on the experts\u0027 analysis and offer our own assessment. Something smells fishy, and we\u0027re determined to uncover the shadows of undue influence.\n\nThis isn\u0027t your run-of-the-mill reaction video; it\u0027s a deep dive into the murky waters of celebrity accountability or lack thereof and the shady AF \u0022relationship\u0022 that TOP Hollywood \u0022elites\u0022 have forged with a Scientology who is a grotesque crooked organization that is  literally in the business of collecting and data mining highly incriminating information out of including but not limited to its celebrity members . \n\nSubscribe, like, and share to be part of this critical AF discussion. \n\n#ChildIterrogators #scientologytheaftermath #Scientology #nomorekidsinscientology #CelebrityApologies #AccountabilityMatters #TakingAStand #demandaccountability #Hollywood #corruptAF #WhatInTheLiteralHell #childtrafficking #childtraffickingawareness #blackmail #undoinfluence",

It is a solemn proclamation, imbued with the gravest of concerns.\r\n\r\nWe pull back the curtain on Ribisi\u0027s troubling decision to feign ignorance AF while standing as a bulwark for the utterly indefensible. \r\n\r\nWe present an unflinching mirror to a man who has enjoyed immeasurable prosperity and wielded considerable sway in the entertainment industry. Yet, in his staunch loyalty, he willing has not a shred of a problem with fully disclosing who he is and his apparent lack of any shred of self awareness or  morality.\r\n\r\nThis is not a mere conversation; it is an indomitable call to action. It is a steadfast stance against those who seek to sanitize the actions of fully convicted rape apologists amidst the glittering fa\u00E7ade of corrupt Hollywood and Scientology who appear to be two literal peas in a pod.. \r\n\r\nLet us be perfectly clear\u2014this is not a discussion diluted with ambiguity or softened with hesitation. This is a declaration of the utmost seriousness, delivered without compromise. \r\n\r\nTogether, we shall raise our voices against such grievous transgressions, demanding the accountability that justice so rightfully demands.\r\n\r\n#HollywoodAccountability #RapeApologists #TakingAStand #UnwaveringResolve #GiovanniRibisi #Scientology #Felonies #ChildTrafficking #NoMoreKidsInScientology #Enabler #CorruptAF",

      "description": "Today, we continue to confront a deeply serious issue that transcends the glitter and glamour of Hollywood. \r\n\r\nIt\u0027s a matter that delves into the heart of accountability, ethics, and moral responsibility, and it begs for our undivided attention.\r\n\r\nIn recent developments, we\u0027ve witnessed the public stance of Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis in support of their friend, co-worker, former business partner and BFF for \u0022decades\u0022 Danny Masterson, who stands convicted of rape. \r\n\r\nThis revelation propels us to ponder a fundamental AF question: \r\n\r\nTo what MF extent do individuals, especially those in the public eye, align themselves with friends entangled in controversy?\r\n\r\nWe push back on all the half baked narratives floating around to embark on a quest to actually dissect, question, and glean profound insights. \r\n\r\nWe\u0027re driven to unveil the intricate layers of a world where certain narratives are obscured ($$$$$$$$$) , where voices of survivors are often silenced, and where the pursuit of justice is designed to be a rigged AF uphill battle for all victims of abuse including but not limited to child trafficking and SA. \r\n\r\nThis journey leads us to the murkier recesses of influence, privilege, and the molding of public perception. It\u0027s an exploration of the facts that have lingered in plain view, yet have been consistently evaded or disregarded AF.\r\n\r\nAnd as we delve deeper into this discussion, it\u0027s crucial to note that Mila Kunis herself, at one point, publicly called out her husband, Ashton Kutcher, for his infidelity in his \u0022marriage\u0022 with Demi Moore, exposing even more things that make not a SHRED OF SENSE IN THIS YEAR 2023. \r\n \r\nMrs Kunis simultaneously, advocated for her friend, Kid who grew up in Scientology and was child trafficked by him mother Carol Masterson --Danny Masterson, who can now add convicted serial  rapist to his resume.  \r\n\r\nThis stark duality in Milas public stance truly raises perplexing questions about the complexities of why they appear so pressed to \u0022stay loyal\u0022, advocating against accountability, while purporting that it\u0027s the absolute opposite. \r\n\r\nToday, we defy the forces that seek to shroud these critical matters in darkness. \r\n\r\nWe pledge to cast a piercing light onto them a LITERAL SPOT LIGHT. \r\n\r\nActual accountability is needed to ignite meaningful dialogue, and to insist upon transparency and moral true overdue AF actual reckoning. \r\n\r\nBeing \u0022silent\u0022 is not longer an option the fake woke elites that have been Punking us this hold time need to stop the clown show and get real become honest and get straight. \r\n\r\nNothing Changes if literally NOTHING MF CHANGES. \r\n\r\n#NoMoreKidsInScientolgy #HollywoodcorruptAF #MilaKunis #AshtonKutcher",

Raised as a Scientologist, Mrs Moss and her family were accustomed to a world where they were treated as if they were beyond \u0022special\u0022\n\nThe question we\u0027re exploring is simple but crucial: What\u0027s the point of all this? \n\nWhat\u0027s the truth behind the Scientology fake AF \u0022glamour\u0022, especially when it involves the systemic institutionalized mistreatment of kids at an industrial size scale? \n\nJoin the conversation as we aim to uncover the deeper layers of Elizabeth Moss\u0027s Scientology experience and the broader issues it raises about the organization. \n\nIt\u0027s time to confront the unsettling reality beneath the surface. \n\ncc: @fbi \n\n#NoMoreKidsInScientology #forcedabortions #Illegal #crimesagaistchildren #demandaccountability #childtrafficking #endchildtrafficking",

      "description": "Today we dive into the unsettling details of Jenna Miscavige\u0027s story of how she grew up in Scientology and react to how these horrific rampant state sanctioned abuse of children still goes on as we speak.   Anderson Cooper\u0027s  news segment focused on being salacious and trivialized the very real plight and the shared experiences of Jenna Miscavige and hundreds of other kids that grew up in Scientology who have been totally ignored by the crooked \u0022other fish to fry\u0022  corporate media. \n\nAs \u200B\u2060  Anderson Copper  takes on the role of \u0022concerned reporter\u0022, we can\u0027t help but draw a sharp contrast between the empathetic facade and the harsh realities that countless children, including Jenna and myself, endured in the clutches of this abominable US sanctioned child trafficking racketeering enterprise who - literally kid you not whatsoever is still currently \u0022at it\u0022 targeting, recruiting and abusing minors at an unprecedented industrial size scale. \n\nIn his news segment, Cooper ostensibly addresses the dislocation of minors across borders \u2013 a topic that hits painfully close to home for Jenna, myself, and so many others. \n\nWe are constantly asked to recount the systematic dislocation and horrific traumas we the kids that grew up in Scientology were subjected to as children within Scientology chain of Hotels and commercial buildings. \n\nThis highly illegal text book child trafficking practice of sending children across continents, away from their families and familiar environments, in the name of crisis management and covering up including but not limited to class A felonies perpetrated on minors is something that everybody \u0022knows about\u0022 yet they just choose to play \u0022dumb\u0022 in this year 2023. \n\nAs we sit here and contemplate  a decade plus transpired and Cooper\u0027s feigned concern for these young victims could not be more acted if he tried. \n\nWe can\u0027t help but wonder if he truly comprehends the depths of the trauma and horrific levels of manipulation, coersion and fraud that were perpetrated on all these children that Scientology parents as an \u0022adult collective\u0022 were all about endorsing, funding and accessing for themselves. \n\nThe experiences of those like Jenna and I, who were uprooted and dislocated from our homes to be child trafficked by our parents, offer a stark juxtaposition to Cooper\u0027s glib AF \u0022news\u0022 coverage. \n\nIt\u0027s a poignant reminder that the true stories of these children, including Jenna, deserve more than just a passing mention \u2013 they demand a resounding call for change and actual application of justice and all applicable laws concerning child trafficking actually enforced. \n\nWhile Cooper may have shone a fleeting spotlight on this issue overa decade ago, our  goal is to provide a fuller picture, to shed light on the systemic abuses, and to amplify the voices of those who have been silenced for far too long, like Jenna and myself. \n\nIt\u0027s a complex and distressing reality that transcends the confines of a news segment, and we are committed to continuing this vital conversation until the plight of these children who were systemically and institutionally child trafficked, receives the literal attention, urgency, and action it so desperately requires to deal with the scourge of this highly illegal deplorable CLASS A FELONY CRIME perpetrated against every last shred of minor who was exposed to including but not limited the fraud ridden \u201CSea Org contract\u201D, ethics interviews, audits and grooming to take the abuse at disgusting so called course rooms that acted as literal grooming salons to prepare kids to \u201Ctake it\u201D \n\n#NoMoreKidsInScientology #jennamiscavige \n#ChildTraffickingReality #DislocatedMinors #SystemicAbuse #SilencedVoices #CallForChange #JusticeForChildren #usacorruptAF\n#statesantionedchildtrafficking #beyondbelief #WhatInTheLiteralHell",

      "description": "Unveiling the Disturbing Views of L. Ron Hubbard on LGBTQ Individuals \uD83C\uDF08\nDive into a startling revelation from L. Ron Hubbard\u0027s book \u0022Science of Survival,\u0022 where his views on those he generalized under the category \u00222.0\u0022 on the tone scale come to light. The source material paints a disconcerting picture of his mindset, as he discussed handling individuals with a tone level below 2.0. We\u0027ve included the chilling passage that exposes his perspective on dealing with these individuals, proposing two options that, unsettlingly, disregard reasoning and compassion.\n\nL. Ron Hubbard\u0027s words highlight an alarming disregard for those he deemed \u0022below 2.0,\u0022 suggesting that they should be raised on the tone scale or discreetly removed from society. The implications of these views are disturbing and raise critical questions about the ethics and morality of such perspectives.\n\nWe also call upon Laura Prepon to address her involvement and financial contributions to Scientology\u0027s \u0022Celebrity Center.\u0022 With her years of personal engagement, it\u0027s puzzling how she could not have witnessed any anti-LGBTQ sentiments or the exploitative labor practices that have been reported, including those involving \u0022Sea Org Members\u0022 or so-called \u0022child slaves.\u0022\n\nAs we shed light on these aspects, it becomes imperative to question the extent of accountability and responsibility in organizations that support such ideologies. Let\u0027s demand transparency and ethical conduct, not just within the Scientology framework, but across society as a whole.\n\nJoin us in seeking answers and driving change. Let\u0027s stand against any form of discrimination, exploitation, and systemic abuse. Our collective voice can create a difference, and it\u0027s time to challenge the status quo. \uD83D\uDC94\uD83C\uDF0D\u270A \n\nScience of Survival Passage: \nThere are only two answers for the handling of people from 2.0 down on the tone scale, neither one of which has anything to do with reasoning with them or listening to their justification of their acts. The first is to raise them on the tone scale by un-enturbulating some of their theta by any one of the three valid processes. The other is to dispose of them quietly and without sorrow. Adders are safe bedmates compared to people on the lower bands of the tone scale.  Not all the beauty nor the handsomeness nor artificial social value nor property can atone for the vicious damage such people do to sane men and women.  The sudden and abrupt deletion of all individuals occupying the lower bands of the tone scale from the social order would result in an almost instant rise in the cultural tone and would interrupt the dwindling spiral into which any society may have entered.  It is not necessary to produce a world of clears in order to have a reasonable and worthwhile social order; it is only necessary to delete those individuals who range from 2.0 down, either by processing them enough to get their tone level above the 2.0 line \u2014 a task which, indeed, is not very great, since the amount of processing in many cases might be under fifty hours, although it might also in others be in excess of two hundred \u2014 or simply quarantining them from the society.  A Venezuelan dictator once decided to stop leprosy. He saw that most lepers in his country were also beggars.  By the simple expedient of collecting and destroying all the beggars in Venezuela an end was put to leprosy in that country.\n\n#NoMoreKidsInScientology #Accountability #EthicsMatter #EndChildTrafficking #LGBTQRights #ChallengeTheNorms #ExposeTheTruth #TogetherForChange",

      "description": "In this episode, we\u0027re delving into the past, reuniting with the remarkable Scientology whistleblower Astra Woodcraft, who bravely stepped forward decades ago. A true OG in the world of whistleblowing, Astra shared her story in an interview conducted by the dedicated Mark Bunker @MarkBunker   Stacey Brooks, back when I found myself unjustly confined within crooked Scientology \u0022captain\u0022 Debbie Cook\u0027s disgusting hotel of child horrors \n\nIt\u0027s surreal to think that during that very interview in 2001, while Astra was shedding light on the horrors of Scientology, I was enduring a similar fate in that very same environment updated with all the \u0022security safety features\u0022 that Debbie Cook was installing around her hotels to make sure \u0022no one could escape\u0022. Mrs Cook meet weekly with her inner circle of underlings her so called \u0022juniors\u0022  including but not limited to \u0022executive council\u0022 and her \u0022perimeter council\u0022 and her \u0022tech hierarchy\u0022 meeting with all the Senior Case Supervisors to get the latest \u0022data mined skinny\u0022 (which included but was not limited to fresh rounds of class A felony admissions in sessions by adults that were paying to have this done) \n\nThey loved their fresh  batches of \u0022withholds pulled\u0022. \n\nThey salivated and powered tripped on thinking they were so\u0022special\u0022 for getting so much highly disgusting and inappropriate \u0022nitty gritty\u0022 for which none of them had a shred of a qualification to be ADVISING OVER. \n\nFast forward to today, and the distressing reality remains unchanged for countless children trapped within these walls. \n\nAstra\u0027s accounts resonate deeply with second gen 3,4,5,6 Generation Scientology kids experience, as well as those of numerous others. \n\nOur parents, being misguided by crooked Scientology Hotel executives, were apparently all about having \u0022us\u0022 the literal KIDS  so called \u0022Adults in Small Bodies\u0022 sign apparently fully binding contracts as if minors entering into such agreements we are being told is a sacred practice so highly religious that we are so stupid to think we can advocate for ourselves because in America the legal profession is all about enforcing contracts ON MINORS right attorneys that \u0022defend and represent\u0022 Scientology and all the rest of y\u0027alls sham \u0022shell corporations\u0022 RTC CSI blah blah blah...????\n\nIt\u0027s astounding how these contracts are still being pitched to us in this year 2023 as religiously protected whatever it is that they call it. \n\nBecause apparently in the eyes of the United States legal system, despite the glaring absence of our capacity to comprehend the gravity of what we were signing - we could not have less of a valid \u0022legal\u0022 case as long as your parents SIGNED YOU UP TO BE TRAFFICKED INSIDE AN AMERICAN LUXURY HOTEL THAT HOLLYWOOD CELEBRITIES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO TOM MF CRUISE FREQUENT. \n\nY\u0027all must really think we are still kids and stupid AF apparently none of you seem to understand how MF much THESE UNITED STATES INSULT OUR COLLECTIVE ADULT INTELLIGENCE in the aftermath of being scammed and betrayed ad nauseam with literal child trafficking text book accouding to the \u0022law\u0022 that no one seems to be able to or want to enforce in this country - someway - somehow. \n\nNO matter how much money and resoruces yall have there is always an excuse NO TO  BE ABLE TO DO THE JOB YALL ARE being subsidized  TO DO --- Yes or NO? (asking for a buddy, a friend a kid inside those hotels as we speak TBH) \n\nIn America, it seems that KIDS (underage minors) signing contracts is an activity that not only were we coerced into performing without truly understanding their implications - I could have been any more LEGAL is what we are still being told in this year 2023. \n\nNever mind that we were told not to worry about understanding any legal contract including but not limited to NDA\u0027s MULTI MILLION DOLLAR \u0022BONDS\u0022, just to sign away IS WHAT WE WERE ADVISED INSIDE THESE HOTELS OVER AND OVER AND OVER. \n\nOur age and comprehension didn\u0027t matter, as we were coerced into contract after contract, each time delving into more inappropriate realms. \n\nWe were children, incapable of giving informed consent. \n\nYet, this \u0022legal\u0022 system we have in this country has decided to play dumb with a more than willful a \u0022blind eye\u0022\n\nAs we revisit Astra\u0027s story, it\u0027s a somber reminder that the echoes of our past still reverberate in the present. \n\nThe fight continues to unveil the injustices that minors endure within Scientology, and it\u0027s crucial that we persistently advocate for the rights and well-being of these vulnerable individuals. The road ahead may be long, but the truth deserves to be heard, and change must be ignited. #ScientologyWhistleblowers #ChildRights #BreakTheSilence #corruption",

This form of psychological torture, coupled with absurd demands like documenting every time we played with \u0022barbie dolls\u0022  or expressed ourselves as \u0022out of valence\u0022, illustrates the depths of indoctrination and control and abominations that Scientology parents that belong to this child abuse ridden organization were all about \u0022endorsing\u0022 \n\nHubbard\u0027s writings, filled with hate and intolerance, do not spare the LGBTQ community -especially LGBTQ KIDS. \n\nWe confront his extremist and highly reprehensible views that suggest the literal \u0022deletion\u0022 of gay individuals, questioning the moral compass of a nation that claims to have fought against tyranny and discrimination only to fully endorse one of its own - indicted runaway felon L Ron Hubbard. \n\nHow can a country that prides itself on opposing Nazi ideology allow the words of an indicted felon to mirror the rhetoric that once fueled this type of horrific dehumanizing oppression?\n\nWe raise this critical question: Is America fully aware of the repercussions of exporting Hubbard\u0027s extremist rhetoric all across the world? \n\nLGBTQ children, vulnerable and seeking acceptance,  fall victim to the grip of this destructive ideology as Scientology parents endorsed and entitle themselves to torture and abuse literal kids in the name of... whatever it is that the IRS commissioner said this state sanctioned abuse of kids at scale is being  \u0022called\u0022 - a \u0022501c\u0022 where Americans can sign up to abuse KIDS WITHOUT a SHRED of CONSEQUENCES because apparently the rule of law does not apply in these HOLLYWOOD CELEBRITY INFESTED \u0022LUXURY HOTELS\u0022 RIGHT OR WRONG @LAPDHQ  @clearwaterPubSafety  CC: @fbi \n\nIt\u0027s time to hold the nation accountable for allowing such rhetoric to persist and to address the far-reaching consequences it has on KIDS lives worldwide - all thanks to the crooked IRS commissioner who decided to capitulate to the demands of extremists sycophants of indicted felon L Ron Hubbard.   \n\nWe will continue to unravel the disturbing legacy of Hubbard\u0027s teachings and highlight and underline the urgent need for awareness, accountability, and change. \n\nIt\u0027s time for America to reconcile its values with its actions and ensure that no one falls prey to the twisted doctrines that systemically and institutionally endanger CHILDREN\u0027S WELL BEING  by exposing them to unthinkable sadistic AF tortures. \n\n #ConfrontingExtremism #GrowingUpGay #ScientologyExposed #NoMoreKidsInScientology",

      "description": "@FBI Success in Combatting Child Abuse and trafficking vs. Inaction Against Scientology\n\nIn 2021, the FBI showcased its remarkable ability to combat child abusers by conducting an extensive year-and-a-half investigation that led to 98 arrests, effectively dismantling a network of child exploiters. It\u0027s clear that the FBI possesses the skills and determination to take down child trafficking operations and protect vulnerable lives. However, a stark contrast emerges when we examine their approach to another well-known entity.\n\nWhile the FBI has demonstrated its commitment to rooting out child abusers, it\u0027s perplexing to witness their inaction towards Scientology\u0027s systemic child trafficking and abuse allegations. Despite having evidence, testimonies, and decades of reports, the agency has yet to take concrete steps to hold the Church of Scientology accountable for the unthinkable crimes occurring within their ranks.\n\nIn Florida, where the Attorney General Ashley Moody pledges a \u0022zero tolerance\u0022 stance against child trafficking, the reality remains grim AF. \n\nThe Clearwater Police and the Tampa Bay Times have stood on the sidelines, offering no effective action against the persistent child trafficking occurring within Scientology hotels for over five decades. \n\nThis raises questions about their motives and their complicity in allowing these atrocities to continue unchecked. cc: @clearwaterPubSafety  @TampaBayTimes \n\nIt\u0027s crucial to question why law enforcement agencies and officials who have the power to enforce the law and protect the innocent fail to do so when it comes to entities like Scientology. The glaring disparity between the FBI\u0027s success in other cases and their lack of intervention here highlights a disturbing pattern of selective enforcement.\n\nAs child trafficking survivors, we implore the FBI and other relevant \u0022legal authorities\u0022 to address this glaring inconsistency and take swift action against those who perpetrate child trafficking and exploitation, regardless of their affiliations. \n\nIt\u0027s time to demand real change, expose corruption, and protect the rights and safety of all vulnerable individuals. \n\nOur question is simple but profound: When will the @fbi and any other institutions cease turning a blind eye and take meaningful steps to end the scourge of child trafficking within Scientology? \n\nIt\u0027s time to put words into action and deliver justice where it is long overdue - we either have \u0022laws\u0022 in this country or we DONT. \n\nWe know there are good law enforcement officers out there that deeply care about this issue - so please if you know any of them let them know what we NEED THEIR HELP TODAY (not \u0022tomorrow\u0022 not when is convenient to get to it for all kids that are currently stuck inside of  those hotels are being subjected to the same type of unthinkable abuse we were told as children was all just a \u0022religious experience\u0022 what we were having. \n\nThat was a total BS false pitch that we wont swallow in this year 2023. \n\nPeriod full stop. #NoMoreKidsInScientology - the adults that can consent to being made slaves and love it can stay inside the hotels 21 and OVER ONLY! \n\n #EndChildTrafficking #AccountabilityNow #ProtectOurChildren",

      "description": "Diving into the Depths of RICO Laws in Child Trafficking | Unveiling Shocking Realities\n\n\uD83D\uDD0D Curious about the RICO Act and its role in battling child trafficking? Join us on a journey of understanding as we unravel the complexities of RICO laws and shed light on the disturbing truth hidden beneath the surface.\n\n\u2696\uFE0F The RICO Act, an acronym for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, was originally created to dismantle organized crime syndicates like the mafia. But did you know that its scope goes far beyond that? In this video, we continue to delve into how the RICO Act can be a potent weapon against international child trafficking, even when it involves American-based hotels. \uD83C\uDDFA\uD83C\uDDF8\uD83D\uDED1\n\nExplore the crucial elements of how the RICO Act applies to child trafficking:\n\nDeciphering RICO: Beyond targeting individual criminals, the RICO Act aims to dismantle entire networks profiting from illicit activities. \uD83D\uDE94\uD83D\uDEA8\n\nChild Trafficking as a Criminal Enterprise: Complex networks of recruiters, traffickers, and facilitators often define child trafficking rings \u2013 qualifying them as criminal enterprises under RICO. \nCC: Florida \u0026 California AGs, where silence echoes loud. \uD83D\uDCA4\n\nThe Pattern of Racketeering: To invoke RICO, prosecutors must demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity. Child trafficking rings involve various crimes like kidnapping, sexual exploitation, and money laundering \u2013 forming a reprehensible pattern. \uD83D\uDCA9\n\nRole of Scientology\u0027s including but not limited to American-Based Hotels: When child trafficking traces back to American-based hotels, which enable exploitation, the RICO Act targets traffickers and those who profit or facilitate such crimes. \uD83D\uDCB0\n\nProsecuting the Entire Network: Law enforcement can use RICO to target all players in the criminal enterprise \u2013 from recruiters and traffickers to hotel owners, investors, and even complicit officials. CC: Florida \u0026 California AGs, a wake-up call. \uD83D\uDCDD\uD83D\uDE94 BCC: @fbi  @LAPDHQ  @clearwaterPubSafety \n\nRICO empowers authorities to seize assets, disrupt operations, and hold accountable all involved in child trafficking. \n\nThis legal tool becomes a formidable ally in the battle against this heinous crime, safeguarding vulnerable children\u0027s rights if anyone in these United States of America ever bothers to actually enforce any laws against child trafficking that remains to be seen by the fact of America\u0027s law enforcement reckless negligence shown by their abysmal record in actually combating crimes affecting CHILDREN. \n\n\uD83D\uDEA8 Raise awareness of RICO\u0027s potential in ending child trafficking! \n\nPlease share this video to amplify the message and join our movement to eradicate this grave injustice. Ask questions leave those in our comments its time to FACE REALITY and its really time to STOP PLAYING DUMB. \n\nTogether, we can make a difference! \uD83D\uDC9C\uD83C\uDF08 #NoMoreKidsInScientology\n#ricoact  #EndChildTrafficking #JusticeForChildren #TogetherWeStand #NoMoreKidsInScientology\n\nDisclaimer: This video offers general information on RICO and its application to child trafficking. Y\u0027all should really start to consult actually qualified legal professionals to start gettin the  specific advice that applies to y\u0027all. \n\nRemember, we\u0027re former Scientology kids that did not even complete high school all we can do is sit here on the sidelines and  advocating for justice for all current KIDS being affected by this disgusting unthinkable child trafficking state sanctioned abuse of minors  at scale . \uD83D\uDCAA\uD83C\uDF93\n\nResources: Justice.gov/humantrafficking/key-legislation",

As individuals who grew up within the confines of Scientology, we are uniquely positioned to provide firsthand accounts and evidence that shed light on the harrowing reality of child trafficking within this highly corrupt organization.\n\nOur mission is clear: to provide a comprehensive contextualization that exposes the shortcomings of corporate media when it comes to investigating the horrifying reality of child trafficking within Scientology.\n\nAs we react to the 60 Minutes Australia coverage, we uncover the disturbing pattern of sensationalism over substance in media reporting. It is disheartening to see our stories, as survivors, suppressed by a media more focused on YouTube profits than the welfare of innocent children constantly dehumanizing us with a bunch of pathetic AF half baked narratives.\n\nJoin us as we dissect the misrepresentations, omissions, and shortcomings of their \u0022coverage\u0022, and continue to shed light on the untold details that keep being trivialized but yet literally demand attention - its not like \u0022innocent children\u0022 don\u0027t SUFFER every single time they botch the story (73 years and counting... TBH) \n\nThe plight of minors trapped within Scientology hotels, ensnared in the clutches of child trafficking, cannot be ignored any longer. \n\nWe question the motivations of corporate media including but not limited to @60MinutesAU  that seem more interested in views and clicks than in revealing the truth and driving meaningful change of the sake of innocent children FFS. \n\nAdditionally, we confront the unsettling relationship between corruption between the LAPD \u0022Human Trafficking Division\u0022 LT Marc Evans and his cozy fraternizing highly inappropriate relationship with none other than Hollywood Scientology actress @MarisolNicholsOfficial  \n\nHow can we trust those who are meant to uphold the law when they are entangled in questionable alliances? \n\nThe corruption is alarmingly evident,  yet everyone around us keeps playing \u0022DUMB\u0022\n\nWell we are here to bring it to the forefront.\n\nJoin us in this crucial endeavor to expose the hidden truths, demand accountability from the media, and challenge the status quo that has capitulated to a racketeering criminal institution that for too long has been allowed to practice CHILD SLAVERY and including but not limited to laundering self admitted class A felonies perpetrated on minors and children NO LESS. \n\nThe time for change is now. \n\nTogether we can unveil the reality and pave the way for justice - the justice that every last shred of minor that was scammed in those HOTELS FROM HELL ACTUALLY DESERVES. \n\n#ExposeTheTruth #CorporateMediaFail #InvestigativeJournalism #ChildTrafficking #ScientologyExposure #UnveilingCorruption #MediaAccountability #JusticeForMinors #InPlainSight #EndExploitation #ActivismForChange #UncoverReality #DemandJustice #HoldThemAccountable #ChangeThroughAwareness #MediaManipulation #HumanRights #StopExploitation #SeekingTruth #StandAgainstCorruption",

But the real shocker comes when you witness the audacious familiarity between Nichols and Lieutenant Marc Evans, head of the LAPD\u0027s Trafficking division and LAPD veteran of law \u0022enforcement\u0022 \n\nEvans, fully donned in his LAPD uniform and badge, unapologetically plugs his own  book \u0022Selling the Daughters of America\u0022 on Nichols\u0027 podcast and discusses all manner of inappropriate subjects in this very nonchalant utterly tone deaf interview. \n\nMeanwhile, Nichols presents herself as an \u0022advocate\u0022  against slavery, all while she personally benefits from child slaves and minors procured for the Scientology hotels\u0027 that Marisol is a paid member of. \n\nThe irony couldn\u0027t be more disturbing or predictable. \n\nFinally things are starting to make sense after decades of being gaslight not only by Scientology\u0027s corrupt collective of un indicted criminal child trafficking conspirators the so called  \u0022hotel Lt Captain high ranking executives\u0022  - but  literally the Los Angeles Police Department  who have been infiltrated by this honey pot plant. \n\nWatch for yourself and witnessed corruption of this American \u0022police department\u0022 is open for everyone to see -  literally in plain sight. \n\nIt begs the question\u2014when will police departments,  including but not limited to LAPD, Riverside  California and Clearwater Police Department, clean up their act and stand up against their more than utterly compromised reckless corruption? \n\nWhere is the oversight for these police departments? \n\nNowhere to be found apparently! \n\nWho\u0027s responsible for curbing this corruption that seems to have infiltrated the very institutions entrusted with  enforcing the \u0022laws\u0022?  \n\nHow useless can any of these so called \u0022Human Trafficking\u0022 laws be if there is no one to enforce them? \n\nWhy are these police departments being left to their own devices, without a shred of accountability?\n\nLieutenant Marc Evans is literally \u0022Exhibit A\u0022,  proving his critical thinking skills could not be any more compromised as he sits in front of this woman \u0022long term buddy of his\u0022 and very publicly demonstrates without any self awareness his utter inability to uphold the level of integrity his position CALLS FOR. \n\nIt\u0027s time for a reckoning, a call for true accountability, and a demand for actual  justice. \n\nIts time for these police departments to stop being knee caped by Scientology\u0027s manipulative AF self serving tactics all in an effort to keep their child trafficking racketeering scheme \u0022going\u0022. \n\nBecause the actual victims of Mr Evans falling for this honey pot are the children and minors currently stuck inside those hotels where all manner of grotesque abominations are perpetrated on minors all with full oversight of the corrupt hotel executives no less. \n\nYO! LAPD - we won\u0027t be silenced we will continue to expose all of your corruption, along with the Riverside Police Department and the Clearwater Police Department who rank highest in corruption and being compromised under the influence of these pathetic child abusers that these police departments are pressed to not \u0022insult\u0022 because they are buddies\n\nStand with us as we continue to unravel this unsettling web of complicity and unthikable present time collusion between Scientology and these toothless corrupt police departments \n\nJoin us in this pursuit for truth and actual justice. \n\nDon\u0027t forget to subscribe, hit the notification bell, and let your voice be heard in the comments below.

      "description": "In this video, we review and critique the recent coverage by 60 Minutes Australia regarding Danny Masterson\u0027s conviction on two counts of forcible rape. Brace yourselves, because the so-called \u0022top tier media\u0022 including but not limited to \u002260 Minutes Australia\u0022 has managed to fumble the facts, misrepresent crucial details, and even spiral into the realm of extraterrestrial nonsense, completely missing the mark on what truly matters.\n\nIt\u0027s time to hold the corporate media accountable for their shockingly lackluster coverage that seems more fixated on sensationalism than uncovering the truth and the plight of kids growing up in Scientology and contextualize how even a literally child that grew up in \u0022Scientology\u0022 Danny Masterson got where he ended up and what type of circumstances and beliefs landed him exactly in the place of his life he is in right now. \n\nWe\u0027re diving deep into the mess that\u0027s been made, giving this big-name outlet a dismal grade 10 our of 10 they get a \u00226.5\u0022 which is a total FLUNK for their lack of due diligence and outright misinformation.\n\nPrepare for an unfiltered reaction video as we dissect the glaring inconsistencies, correct the record, and shed light on the aspects that have been carelessly glossed over by this money-chasing, integrity-lacking corporate media. \n\nIt\u0027s beyond infuriating to witness their neglect when it comes to highlighting the devastating impact on minors who continue to pay the very real price with their lives being up ended  as a direct result of their abysmal coverage as they continue to coddle and capitulate to all consenting fully grown Scientology adults that are trafficking and abusing minors at scale no less.  \n\nAnd we are  not stopping there, we taking a critical look at \u0022Scientologist mother of the year\u0022 Mrs Carol Masterson, Danny\u0027s own mother, who played a significant role in normalizing and instilling the damaging and utterly misguided and criminal normalizing  beliefs that she decided to introduce and groom her own child with. \n\nWe also dispel any ideas that \u0022Scientology parents\u0022 had no idea what in the hell they were doing, we expose how they have no plausible deniability based on the fact of how things ran inside those hotels from hell that this media cant stop pitching as \u0022church\u0022 \n\nWe continue to highlight and expose how the influence of this American indicted and convicted felon in absentia who went on the run the so called \u0022L. Ron Hubbard\u0022 and his more that disgusting distorted criminal normalizing philosophies that have left nothing but a  trail of destruction, land family devastation leading Danny down a path of unforgivable criminal actions.\n\nBut let\u0027s not forget the bigger question that this media circus conveniently sidesteps \u2013 when will the enablers, endorsers, and financiers of this nightmarish dysfunction be held accountable? \n\nIt\u0027s high time that this corrupt and incompetent  media shifts its focus to address the real issues driving the dysfunction, rather than perpetuating the cycle of misinformation and irresponsibility.\n\nJoin us as we tear down the facade and demand better from the media that claims to inform and educate yet in 73 years of \u0022media coverage\u0022 on the public record all they have been able to prove is that they are corrupt  recklessly negligent or incompetent.  \n\nThey can each pick which of the above adjetives actually applies to \u0022them\u0022\n\nWe are no longer kids and we wont be silenced.

We examine her new podcast promoting her non-profit \u0022Marisol Nichols for a Slave-Free World\u0022 and delve deep into her very dubious claims of being a real-life \u0022contracted\u0022 undercover operative exposing child predators and human traffickers.\n\nLINK: https://scientologymoneyproject.com/2019/12/08/a-j-what-scientology-wants-to-know-before-it-approves-you-to-receive-services/\n\nWe shed light on the incongruities surrounding Mrs. Nichols\u0027 connections, considering her \u0022top celebrity\u0022 status within Scientology and how it restricts her from having any secret clearances or ties to government entities with high-security clearances. We reveal the perplexing interviews so called A to J check which Marisol has to subject herself to every time she visits a Scientology organization to get \u201Cserviced\u201D where she\u0027s expected to disclose connections with including but not limited to domestic and/or international intelligence organizations, including the CIA, NSA, FBI, and even the \u0022IRS.\u0022\n\nWe also question the partnership between Marisol Nichols and Tim Ballard, who claim to have worked together for \u0022years.\u0022 \n\nHow could Mr. Ballard overlook the background of his business partner, given the serious nature of their supposed work in child trafficking? \n\nLINK: https://www.kohnswift.com/case/groundbreaking-human-trafficking-lawsuit-against-scientology/\n\nWe bring to light ongoing lawsuits against Mrs. Nichols\u0027 intimately affiliated organization \u201CScientology\u201D for unthinkable trafficking of minors, a practice that Scientology appears to endorse, given that myself along with countless minors have 1st hand experience of being child trafficked inside this wide ranging chain of hotels and commercial buildings. \n\nAs we explore Mrs. Nichols\u0027 podcast titled we literally kid you not \u0022Hollywood Vigilante,\u0022 we are compelled to ask hard-hitting questions:\n\nHow many governments is she truly working with as a \u0022contracted\u0022 operative? \n\nHow many kids is she genuinely saving? \n\nHow much money is she raising for her 501c \u201CMarisol Nichols for A Slave Free World\u201D and how is that being used to actually prevent child trafficking? \n\nWhat is her involvement with the hotel chain she is a paying member to (Scientology Celebrity Center Mannor Hotel) and how is she directly connected to what is alleged in federal child trafficking lawsuits including but not limited to the enslavement of minors?\n\nWe question Access Hollywood\u0027s agenda in promoting such a ridiculous segment without a shred of minimum due diligence. \n\nA simple \u201CGTS\u201D would have shown Mr L\u00F3pez the existing child trafficking lawsuits against Mrs. Nichols\u0027 Scientology organization where repeat she is a major \u201Cdonor\u201D and literally a \u201Cpaid member\u201D\n\nLINK: https://www.preti.com/news/preti-flaherty-files-human-trafficking-and-forced-labor-lawsuit-against-church-of-scientology/\n\nWhy is corporate media allowed to deliver such sloppy and misleading news without any shred of consequences?\n\nJoin us as we expose the truth behind Marisol Nichols\u0027 Scientology connections, her questionable claims, and the disturbing world of child trafficking within this secretive organization. \n\nThis is not gossip, but a call for accountability, transparency, and an end to the exploitation of minors inside Scientology\u2019s hotels and commercial buildings. \n\nPodcast \u2192 https://marisolnichols.com/podcast\nWebsite \u2192 https://marisolnichols.com/\n\n#MarisolNichols #ScientologyExposed #UnmaskingTheTruth #ChildTrafficking #HollywoodVigilante #Accountability #Transparency #AccessHollywood #CelebritiesAndScientology #ExposeTheLies #EndExploitation #JoinTheConversation #SpeakOut #DemandChange #CorporateMediaResponsibility #NoMoreSilence",

      "description": "BREAKING NEWS:\r\n Lori Vallow-Daybell Case Sets Precedent for Accountability in Scientology Parenting\r\n\r\nThe recent sentencing of Lori Vallow-Daybell has sent shockwaves through various communities, raising concerns about the actions of some parents who adhere to controversial beliefs, including those associated with Scientology. Regardless of one\u0027s faith or beliefs, the case highlights the importance of accountability and the responsibility parents have to protect and care for their children. The legal consequences faced by Lori Vallow-Daybell, despite her religious affiliations, sets a precedent that transcends any religious ideology and emphasizes the obligation to abide by the law when raising children.\r\n\r\nBackground of this criminal case:\r\n\r\nLori Vallow-Daybell, a woman associated with the beliefs of the \u0022Prepper\u0022 movement and her alleged ties to elements of Scientology, has garnered national attention due to the tragic disappearance and deaths of her two children, Joshua \u0022JJ\u0022 Vallow and Tylee Ryan. The case exposed the potential dangers of individuals who prioritize their beliefs over their parental duties, raising concerns about the impact of extremist ideologies on parenting decisions.\r\n\r\nAccountability of Parents When it comes to their Kids:\r\n\r\nThe fundamental principle underlying the case of Lori Vallow-Daybell is that, regardless of religious beliefs, parents are legally and morally obligated to protect their children\u0027s well-being and safety. Parenthood comes with a host of responsibilities, and the state has a vested interest in ensuring the welfare of children. The Vallow-Daybell case has illustrated that no matter what religious or philosophical beliefs a parent subscribes to, they must adhere to the law and provide a safe environment for their children.\r\n\r\nSetting a Precedent affecting all \u201CScientology Parents\u201D:\r\n\r\nThe sentencing of Lori Vallow-Daybell sets a significant precedent, establishing that parents who break the law and fail in their parental duties will be held accountable, regardless of their religious affiliation or ideology. This precedent serves as a reminder that religious freedom does not grant a license to act irresponsibly or endanger the lives of children. The legal system\u0027s message is clear: the best interests of the child must always come first, and any violations of this principle will have serious consequences.\r\n\r\nImportance of Separating Beliefs from \u2018Parenting\u2019:\r\n\r\nIn any society, religious freedom is an essential tenet, and individuals have the right to hold and practice their beliefs. However, it is crucial to distinguish between the right to belief and the duty of parenting. While parents have the right to pass on their values to their children, it must be done responsibly, with due consideration for the child\u0027s safety, well-being, and legal rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lori Vallow-Daybell case has brought to light the importance of holding parents accountable for their actions, irrespective of their religious beliefs or affiliations. Parenthood is a responsibility that requires putting the best interests of the child first, ensuring their safety, and abiding by the law. The precedent set by this case emphasizes that religious freedom does not exempt parents from their obligations and responsibilities. It serves as a reminder to all parents, regardless of their faith, that they will be held accountable for their actions when it comes to the welfare of their children.\r\n\r\nIndividuals who have chosen to enable or engage in abusive behavior towards children while claiming to follow the teachings of convicted and indicted in absentia runaway felon \u201CL. Ron Hubbard\u201D must recognize that their actions have legal consequences. \r\n\r\nIn such circumstances, they should seek legal representation from CRIMINAL ATTORNEYS to advocate for their defense.\r\n\r\nWe won\u2019t stop until all minors and senior citizens are safe and away from harms way. \r\n\r\nSerge Del Mar",

Ron Hubbard, that normalizes inappropriate behavior towards children, even going as far as suggesting that a grown man kissing a 7-year-old girl is acceptable. The book tries to rationalize any adverse reactions as mere \u0022prenatal problems,\u0022 which is deeply outrageous and dangerous.\n\nIt\u0027s appalling to see how this corrupt media platform, owned by Disney, turns a blind eye to the disturbing rhetoric being endorsed on national TV no less. \n\nWe continue to question why Travolta is given a platform to promote such dangerous and deranged beliefs without any shred of accountability or responsibility.\n\nJoin us as we demand answers and expose the unsettling truth about Travolta\u0027s pitch and the media\u0027s complicity in allowing such harmful endorsements to go unchecked. It\u0027s time to hold these powerful entities accountable and protect the well-being of all children from such harmful influences.\n\n#JohnTravolta #Dianetics #ScientologyExposed #CorruptMedia #ChildProtection #UnthinkableRhetoric",

      "description": "In this Youtube video, we delve deep into the NBC Rock Center report that exposes part of what was going on behind the scenes when Oscar winning \u0022actress\u0022 Nicole Kidman left her adopted children, fathered with Tom Cruise, behind in the sinister depths of Scientology hotels. \r\n\r\nWe analyze the troubling statements made by Marty Mark Rathbun, who audaciously presents himself as an \u0022auditor\u0022 giving himself all manner of powers to erode all personal privacy boundaries despite pathetically only having  completed a mere two-week course inside a literal cruise ship and just like that got to stick his fangs on celebrities and minors (including but not limited yours truly) \r\n\r\nThe disturbing question arises: Why do celebrities like Tom Cruise consent to being interrogated by Rathbun a complete nobody that has only a 2 week course he took in a cruise ship to be data mining and fully manipulating Tom Cruise? \r\n\r\nWe also confront Kidman\u0027s involvement in the infamous recent Balenciaga campaign that portrays unthinkable themes of BDSM theme teddy bears to promote children\u0027s line. It really seems to be raising huge concerns about what in the world is going on with Kidman and her recurring association with corporations that are both involved in promoting unthinkable child abuse and another one that was and is child trafficking minors as we speak. \r\n\r\nJoin us as we shed light on the haunting reality behind the more than fake glamorous fa\u00E7ade and seek answers to the troubling connections between celebrities who have funded or are actively funding Scientology\u0027s depraved recruitment and targeting of minors to be worked as slaves inside hotels.",

      "description": "In response to some push back on our recent post about Nicole Kidman leaving her adopted kids behind, we want to address specific points of contention and clarify the facts. Our aim is to shed light on the dire situation of minors and kids currently trapped inside these Scientology hotels, drawing from our own first-hand experience as a child trafficked by my own parents within this disturbing hotel chain.\n\nWe understand the sensitivity of the topic, and our intention is to spark a deeper conversation about the dangerous practices of Scientology that impact children, given the lack of advocacy for their plight. We want to emphasize the urgent need to address the larger issues raised by Scientology\u0027s abusive and trafficking practices, which have been ongoing since the inception of this organization.\n\nWhile individual circumstances may vary, it\u0027s crucial to examine these practices in the context of the exploitation and abuse of minors, as public opinion has been deliberately skewed to misinform and confuse the public. We encourage open dialogue and respect for different perspectives while continuing to advocate for the rights and well-being of all children, particularly those affected by child trafficking.\n\nJoin us in raising awareness about the dark realities behind Scientology and the pressing issue of child trafficking.\n\n#NicoleKidman #Corruption #Scientology #TomCruise #IsabellaCruise #ConnorCruise #ChildTraffickingAwareness #ChildTrafficking",

No child under 21 should be inside any Scientology hotel, subjected to extreme and boundary-less role plays so called \u2018audits,\u0027 which are completely inappropriate for minors and anyone unable to provide informed consent.\n\nWe expose the hidden truths and shed light on the disturbing reality of what was going on inside Debbie Cook\u0027s hotel for over 17 years 24/7.\n\nLet\u0027s continue to push for justice and ensure that innocent children are protected from such reprehensible practices, where no limits and extreme role-plays are carried out day in and day out. Together, we can make a difference and advocate for the safety and well-being of all minors.",

Selling them blocks of 12 1/2 hours so called intensives for them to get 1-1 time with a minor. \n\nWe honestly have to question whether Disney is genuinely \u0027woke\u0027 or morally bankrupt, given their knowledge of an organization actively enslaving minors recruited from around the world, enduring unimaginable abuse within their global chain of hotels.\n\nWe will continue to advocate for justice, expose all the false narratives submitted to the courts and the public record that are the very oxygen that allows the type of corrupt environment necessary to carry out unthinkable abuse of kids at an industrial size scale. \n\nVery innocent and defenseless children were made to endure unthinkable responsibilities within Debbie Cook\u2019s Hotel and Disney apparently sees nothing wrong about remaining the neighbor of these people and can\u2019t help themselves but to offer their \u201Claunder the image\u201D of literal child grown men and women abusers. \n\nDebbie Cook the crook was allowed to spout out all manner of carefully crafted lies to manipulate public perception and paint herself as the \u2018victim\u2019 - no less. \n\nIt\u0027s time to confront the dark realities surrounding the systemic abuses of minors, ignored by corporations that are more interested in profiting from pain of literal kids than doing anything to stop it. \n\nDespite Disney being in the literal business of monetizing from kids (who comprise majority of how they make their money) they have demonstrated how abuse of minors at an industrial size scale could not be any less of a \u2018priority\u2019 for them. \n\nIt is clear that their corporation @abcnews could not be any less willing to come to the defense of all defenseless children that were trapped in Debbie Cooks hotel and all of those currently stuck inside there under Cooks replacement as a the so called  \u2018Captain\u2019. \n\nWe will continue to shed light on all the institutionalized abuses and exploitation covered up by literally grown adults who call themselves \u2018executives\u0027 within this so-called \u0027Church\u0027 that is fully run and headquartered inside a hotel, that is actively preying on minors to staff their buildings. \n\nWe will never stop exposing the systemic dehumanizing treatment of ALL 21 AND UNDER KIDS that simply are of no age to be consenting to be used as pawns in the type of extreme depraved role plays so called \u2018audits\u2019 with zero boundaries or safe words that Cook as seen on this interview is still such a big fan of. \n\nAll the while Debbie Cook portrays herself as a victim and cashes monthly checks to keep her mouth WIDE SHUT - how convenient!? \n\nWhere is justice and accountability? \n\nFor all mentioned above - NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. \n\nWell - that is all soon going to CHANGE in a very radical way as we continue to call out all the people monetizing on effectively bringing back \u201Cchild slaves\u201D as a thing in America (NVM the constitution abolished slavery) they could not care less about any laws or constitution - we are speaking from our very own damn experiences having our entire formative years stolen and forced to have a front row seat as literal KIDS to all of this abominable depraved corruption - who affect the kids more than anyone else! \n\nDUH!",
