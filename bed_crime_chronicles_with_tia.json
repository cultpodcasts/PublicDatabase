      "description": "The Krugersdorp cult killings, also known as the \u0022Appointment Murders,\u0022 were a series of murders in South Africa between 2012 and 2016, orchestrated by Cecilia Steyn, a woman who pretended to be a former Satanist turned Christian. She led a small cult-like group called Electus per Deus (Chosen by God).\n\nTogether with her followers\u2014mostly young adults who believed they were doing God\u0027s work\u2014Cecilia planned and carried out at least 11 murders. These included former group members and innocent people lured to their deaths under the pretense of job interviews.\n\nThe motive behind the killings was a mix of manipulation, financial gain through life insurance fraud, and revenge against those who had left or opposed the group.\n\nIn 2019, Cecilia Steyn and several of her co-accused were convicted and sentenced to multiple life terms in prison.",
