      "title": "Inside Apostle David Taylor\u0027s Cult of Extreme Greed",
      "description": "In this video, we go deep inside Apostle David E. Taylor\u2019s so-called \u201Cministry\u201D \u2014 which many are now calling a full-blown greed cult. Behind the flashy stage lights, emotional worship, and extravagant promises lies a dark pattern of manipulation, control, and financial exploitation that has destroyed lives and twisted people\u2019s faith.\n\nApostle David Taylor has become infamous for his lavish lifestyle, claims of face-to-face encounters with Jesus, and constant demands for large \u201Ckingdom offerings.\u201D But as we\u2019ll uncover, these teachings often have little to do with the gospel and everything to do with keeping followers loyal, dependent, and giving.\n\nWe\u2019ll examine the testimonies of former members, financial reports, and on-camera moments that reveal how Taylor uses fear, false prophecy, and emotional pressure to build a cult-like empire of greed \u2014 one where questioning leadership is treated as rebellion against God.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about exposing one man; it\u2019s about understanding how spiritual abuse and deception can flourish when people stop testing what\u2019s being preached against Scripture. The Bible warns about wolves in sheep\u2019s clothing, and this video will show you exactly what that looks like in our time.\n\nSoftware I use (Ecamm) Sign up with this link: https://www.ecamm.com/mac/ecammlive/?fp_ref=christopher23\n\nAFFILIATES\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/shop/allthingstheology\nCovenant Eyes: https://covenanteyes.sjv.io/zNYmqG\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrLO95wGXUW0fY00Rss4aGw/join\n\nWebsite: kdubtru.com\n\nMusic: https://open.spotify.com/artist/1TohVbZFbpZsW5yubbhYm3\n\nSubscribe \u0026 click \uD83D\uDECE for notifications of premieres and live \nstreams!\n\nFollow me on social media:\nTwitter.com/kdubtru\nFacebook.com/allthingstheology\ninstagram.com/kdub.tru/\n\n\nSUPPORT:\n\nPatreon.com/kdubtru\n\nListen on podcast: https://anchor.fm/allthingstheology\n\nEmail for interviews or booking:\n\nallthingstheology@gmail.com",

      "title": "When A Cult Loses Their Cult Leader",
      "description": "What happens to a cult when the leader \u2014 the one they worship, obey, and build their lives around \u2014 suddenly disappears? When the so-called \u201Capostle\u201D or \u201Cprophet\u201D loses power, the entire illusion begins to crack. In this video, we take a deep look at what happens to a cult after their leader falls \u2014 the confusion, the cover-ups, the manipulation that follows, and the spiritual devastation left behind.\n\nApostle David E. Taylor is one of the most controversial religious figures in America, known for outrageous claims of face-to-face encounters with Jesus, extravagant spending, and a personality-driven ministry built entirely around himself. But what happens when that type of leader fades from the spotlight? What happens to the followers who built their faith on a man rather than on Christ?\n\nThis video exposes the dangerous dynamics of personality cults \u2014 from control and deception to the psychological toll it takes on members who believed they were serving God. We\u2019ll explore the warning signs of cult behavior within churches, how followers get drawn in, and how they can find freedom in the true Gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\n\nSoftware I use (Ecamm) Sign up with this link: https://www.ecamm.com/mac/ecammlive/?fp_ref=christopher23\n\nAFFILIATES\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/shop/allthingstheology\nCovenant Eyes: https://covenanteyes.sjv.io/zNYmqG\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrLO95wGXUW0fY00Rss4aGw/join\n\nWebsite: kdubtru.com\n\nMusic: https://open.spotify.com/artist/1TohVbZFbpZsW5yubbhYm3\n\nSubscribe \u0026 click \uD83D\uDECE for notifications of premieres and live \nstreams!\n\nFollow me on social media:\nTwitter.com/kdubtru\nFacebook.com/allthingstheology\ninstagram.com/kdub.tru/\n\n\nSUPPORT:\n\nPatreon.com/kdubtru\n\nListen on podcast: https://anchor.fm/allthingstheology\n\nEmail for interviews or booking:\n\nallthingstheology@gmail.com",

      "description": "In this detailed expos\u00E9, we delve into the controversial claims made by David Taylor, a self-proclaimed spiritual leader who predicts that Jesus will return before the end of the year. With a track record of bold assertions and a temper that raises serious questions about his conduct, this video aims to shed light on the troubling patterns behind his ministry.\n\nFrom unverified prophecies to his frequent displays of anger, we examine the evidence and testimonies that paint a complex picture of his teachings and character. Is this the behavior of a true spiritual leader? Or is it a warning sign for those seeking genuine guidance and truth?\n\n\u26A0\uFE0F Disclaimer: This video is intended for informational and educational purposes only.
