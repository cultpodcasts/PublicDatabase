The greatest fundraiser of the modern church, Maciel founded the Legionaries of Christ, a religious order with a $650 million budget and history of controversial tactics. The lay group he founded is Regnum Christi.\r\n\r\nThe film tracks abuse charges filed against Maciel, beginning in the 1950s, as well as evidence of drug abuse and financial improprieties. \r\n\r\nIn 1998, formal charges are filed with Cardinal Ratzinger (who would later become Pope). The Secretary of State, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, tries to abort the case. In 2004, with Pope John Paul II dying, Ratzinger takes action.\r\n\r\nThe film follows a secret Vatican investigator as witnesses testify about Maciel\u0027s sexual abuse, psychological tyranny, and the vows he imposed to secure Legionaries\u0027 silence.\r\n\r\nAll signs indicate that those at the very top knew about Maciel\u0027s illegal activity, but never stopped him. The Maciel case illustrates the bigger question of how the Vatican justice system functions.\r\n-----\r\nUPDATES: In early 2009, the Legion of Christ made public the fact that Maciel fathered a child who is now in her 20s. In July 2009, the Vatican launched a new investigation, a lengthy worldwide visitation by five bishops to examine the Legion\u0027s finances, Father Maciel\u0027s influence, and other internal dynamics of the Legion and Regnum Christi. In August 2009, reports that Maciel may have more children began surfacing. In December 2009, the Legion announced it has found that a book Maciel wrote in the 1950s, popular among Legion members and followers, was largely plagiarized from another book written in the 1930s. \r\n----\r\nIn spring 2010, director Jason Berry published a two-part series in the National Catholic Reporter, presenting new evidence that Father Maciel paid several Vatican officials (including Secretary of State Cardinal Angelo Sodano, whose friendship with Maciel is detailed in the film) for protection.
