We feel extremely lucky to have been in a position where we could quickly evacuate our loved ones to safe, comfortable accommodation. But these are unexpected expenses and truthfully this is an ongoing situation with no certainty as to when it will end or to what extent it will eat into our finances and disrupt our plans. \n\nThe quakes are ongoing and though our home is still standing we don\u0027t know what condition it will be in when we return - or even how long it will be until it is safe to return. There have been reports that the tectonic activity affecting Croatia could continue for months, so we are currently investigating renting a property on the coast. \n\nIf you would like to help defray our costs, our paypal is https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/jwsurvey \n\nHowever, we both feel we must stress that we consider ourselves *extremely fortunate* compared to the worst affected by this disaster, many of whom have lost their homes, so we ask you to consider supporting the following aid initiative: https://solidarna.hr/\n\nWe also have a friend on the ground who is assisting in rebuilding homes for the worst affected.

      "description": "Details have emerged of a 2019 ruling in Switzerland exonerating a critic of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses that the Watchtower organization unsuccessfully attempted to sue for libel. We\u2019re learning that earlier this year Watchtower missed their deadline to appeal the verdict, meaning it is now final. The ruling, which we\u2019re only now hearing about, is a blow to Watchtower\u2019s efforts to stifle criticism and also raises serious questions over the group\u2019s tax-exempt religious status in many countries.\n\nJW Victims Help website... http://jz.help/en/\nInfosekta website... https://www.infosekta.ch/\nJW Victims Help press release... http://jz.help/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/200708_Press-Release-1.pdf\n\nVisit my website: https://reluctantapostate.co \nSupport me on Patreon: https://patreon.com/cedars \nSupport me via PayPal: https://paypal.me/jwsurvey \nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cedarsjwsurvey\nFollow me on Twitch: https://twitch.tv/lloydevans \nFollow me on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lloydevanscedars/\nBuy my book \u0022The Reluctant Apostate\u0022: http://a.co/5qFN4JU\nBuy my book \u201CHow to Escape From Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u201C: http://a.co/e9OQRi1 \nLeave a voicemail: https://www.speakpipe.com/cedars \nCheck out my t-shirt designs: https://teespring.com/stores/the-reluctant-apostate \nLearn more about #jehovahswitnesses: https://jwfacts.com and https://jwsurvey.org\n\nIf you are personally impacted by the issues discussed in my videos and you are in need of support, please feel free to reach out to the JWsurvey team at the following email: support@jwsurvey.org\n\nAlternatively, you might consider contacting the Recovering from Religion Foundation, which has trained call agents and support groups specializing in assisting those who have suffered as a result of their experience with religious groups.

This is the first time a believer has agreed to appear on my channel for a respectful dialogue, despite a strong likelihood of reprisals if he is discovered.\n\n***A polite request to ex-JWs watching this video: Please can I respectfully ask that all are as kind and understanding as possible to Alex when engaging with him either here or on Twitter. I feel he is misguided but ultimately genuine and well-meaning. Some of his views may be obnoxious, but please remember that we once sincerely shared at least some of them and our waking up process may have been hampered if we had been subjected to abuse and insults from apostates online. Alex deserves respect if only for his bravery in coming forward. Please let\u0027s do what we can to show him that we\u0027re here to help.***\n\nIf you are a believing Jehovah\u0027s Witness (or a sincere JW apologist) and you would like to debate me, please leave a voicemail at this address: https://www.speakpipe.com/cedars \n\nVisit my website: https://reluctantapostate.co \nSupport me on Patreon: https://patreon.com/cedars \nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cedarsjwsurvey\nFollow me on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lloydevanscedars/\nBuy my book \u0022The Reluctant Apostate\u0022: http://a.co/5qFN4JU\nBuy my book \u201CHow to Escape From Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u201C: http://a.co/e9OQRi1 \nLeave a voicemail: https://www.speakpipe.com/cedars \nCheck out my t-shirt designs: https://teespring.com/stores/the-reluctant-apostate \nLearn more about #jehovahswitnesses: https://jwfacts.com and https://jwsurvey.org\n\n#debate #apostate",

      "description": "On Friday, September 13, in a hotel conference room in Billings, Montana, the state\u2019s Supreme Court heard arguments from Watchtower lawyer Joel Taylor in favor of overturning a landmark ruling a year ago when a jury declared Watchtower responsible in part for the abuse of Lexi Nunez from the Thompson Falls congregation.\n\nThe $35 million ruling, which came with a judgment of malice on Watchtower\u2019s part, was handed down because Watchtower elders had refused to report Max Reyes, Lexi\u2019s step-grandfather, after he had abused others, leaving him to continue his crime spree. \n\nIn this episode, the team dissects the case with the help of co-host Mark O\u0027Donnell, who has been assisting the plaintiffs.\n\nJWsurvey article...

      "description": "Back in episode 21 we revealed how an increasingly litigious Watchtower is using a bold new strategy of \u201Csubpoena warfare\u201D in its efforts to stifle criticism of its teachings and practices. In recent months, dozens of subpoenas have been issued by Watchtower to internet giants like Google, Facebook and Reddit requesting information identifying otherwise anonymous whisteblowers who have posted information the organization considers to be copyrighted. This is in addition to cease and desist letters being sent to known activists, including yours truly, threatening legal action over use of copyrighted content. But with the help of the EFF, or Electronic Frontier Foundation, one ex-JW activist is fighting back. Reddit user Darkspilver has issued a motion to quash Watchtower\u2019s attempts to subpoena their information, and Watchtower has responded with a 48-page document defending their attempted violation of Darkspilver\u2019s privacy.\n\nRead the documents:\nMotion to Quash https://www.eff.org/document/motion-quash-1\nWatchtower Response https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.336935/gov.uscourts.cand.336935.11.0.pdf\n\nDonate to the Electronic Frontier Foundation:\nhttps://supporters.eff.org/donate/join-eff-4\n\nCheck out Leonard\u0027s videos on the matter:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDsYWqxdAzA\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uerWKb8KGM\n\nWatch our \u0022Subpoena Warfare\u0022 episode:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwWq5z7MgFc\n\nVisit my website: https://reluctantapostate.co \nSupport me on Patreon: https://patreon.com/cedars \nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cedarsjwsurvey\nFollow me on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lloydevanscedars/\nBuy my book \u0022The Reluctant Apostate\u0022: http://a.co/5qFN4JU\nBuy my book \u201CHow to Escape From Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u201C: http://a.co/e9OQRi1 \nLeave a voicemail: https://www.speakpipe.com/cedars \nCheck out my t-shirt designs: https://teespring.com/stores/the-reluctant-apostate",

And so, in the first of this three-day convention, Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses are having their siege mentality and persecution complex kicked into overdrive with a series of highly-coercive videos.\n\nSupport me on Patreon: https://patreon.com/cedars \nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cedarsjwsurvey\nFollow me on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lloydevanscedars/\nBuy my book \u0022The Reluctant Apostate\u0022: http://a.co/5qFN4JU\nBuy my book \u201CHow to Escape From Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u201C: http://a.co/e9OQRi1 \nLeave a voicemail: https://www.speakpipe.com/cedars \nCheck out Lloyd\u2019s t-shirt designs: https://teespring.com/stores/the-reluctant-apostate",

In a video released late last year, Governing Body helper Gary Breaux used Matthew chapter 18 to defend the rule, insisting that it would \u0022never\u0022 be abandoned. \n\nIn this rebuttal, I go back and take a look at Breaux\u0027s comments in the October 2016 JW Broadcasting episode, which perfectly demonstrate Watchtower\u0027s habit of twisting Bible verses to suit their needs.\n\nSupport me on Patreon: https://patreon.com/cedars \nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cedarsjwsurvey\nFollow me on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lloydevanscedars/\nBuy my book \u0022The Reluctant Apostate\u0022: http://a.co/5qFN4JU\nBuy my book \u201CHow to Escape From Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u201C: http://a.co/e9OQRi1 \nLeave a voicemail: https://www.speakpipe.com/cedars \nCheck out Lloyd\u2019s t-shirt designs: https://teespring.com/stores/the-reluctant-apostate",

In this video, I tackle some of the most common objections to my video, and explain why a JW.org \u0022FAQ\u0022 section on the subject is misleading.\n\nSupport me on Patreon: https://patreon.com/cedars\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cedarsjwsurvey\nBuy my book, \u0022The Reluctant Apostate\u0022: http://a.co/5qFN4JU",

In particular, I discuss the issue of prayer, and how both responses to prayer and lack of responses to prayer have an explanation if you\u0027re a Jehovah\u0027s Witness.",

Their treatment of him began before they found out he had started having sex with his girlfriend after years together.\n\nAs Matthias mentions in this conversation, there is no direct biblical injunction against sex before marriage. Christian fundamentalist objections to extramarital sex arise from various interpretations of the Greek word porneia, which is translated as \u0022fornication.\u0022\n\nThe Insight book (Volume 1, page 862) describes fornication, not as an exclusive reference to sex relations outside of marriage, but as \u0022a general term for all unlawful intercourse,\u0022 including adultery and unlawful marriage. \n\nThe book \u0022Hidden Bible Taboos Forbidden By Organized Christianity\u0022 by Door James Slobodzien says under the heading \u0022Original Definition of \u0027Fornication\u0027\u0022...\n\n\u0022The American Heritage Dictionary of the English language, Fourth Edition states that the origin of the word \u0027fornication\u0027 derives from Latin. The word fornix means \u0027an archway\u0027 or \u0027vault\u0027 and it became a common euphemism for a brothel as prostitutes could be solicited in the vaults beneath Rome. More directly, fornication means \u0027done in the archway\u0027; thus it originally referred to prostitution.\u0022",

      "description": "If you are a UK national and wish to register a complaint against Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses with the Charity Commission, here is the link you need...\nhttp://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/contact-us/general-enquiries/report-a-concern-about-a-charity/\n\nI recommend lodging your complaint against the WATCH TOWER BIBLE AND TRACT SOCIETY OF BRITAIN, registered charity no. 1077961\n\nWhen choosing my option of complaint, I chose the final option, \u0022Serious non-compliance in a charity which, left unchecked, could damage public trust and confidence in the Charity Commission as an effective regulator\u0022\n\nWhen asked if I had evidence, I said yes. \n\nWhen asked to provide a summary of evidence, I said the following... \u0022This so-called \u0027charity\u0027 is in serious breach of the rules on public benefit. The benefit statements on Watchtower\u0027s SIR are deliberately misleading. Watchtower, and its various affiliated organizations in the UK including the International Bible Students Association (no. 216647) and all congregations of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, are engaged in work that is detrimental to public benefit in 5 key areas: (1) Their child abuse policies, as demonstrated by their elder\u0027s guidebook and letters of instruction to elders (e.g. Oct 1, 2012), put children in danger by insisting that the branch should initially manage child abuse accusations rather than the police, (2) they violate the human rights of former members (like myself) by coercing believing family members to shun them (not talk to them), as evidenced by various magazine articles and talk recordings, (3) they dissuade abused women from seeking a divorce, insisting that only adultery is suitable grounds for divorce, and implying through their literature that reading the bible is a cure for a violent spouse, (4) since 1945 Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses have been coerced by Watchtower to spurn certain medical treatments, namely blood transfusions, resulting in needless deaths, and (5) young people in the religion are dissuaded from pursuing higher education thus impairing their future employment options, as evidenced by various magazine articles and talk recordings.\u0022\n\nWhen asked about additional facts and information, I said... \u0022I have an abundance of evidence in the form of magazine articles, copies of books, first-hand accounts and talk recordings to substantiate my claims. I would be willing to send this to the CC in a dossier on request, or present it in person.\u0022\n\nWhen asked about attempts I made to get the charity to correct the issue, I said: \u0022I have written to the organization\u0027s leadership in America (the Governing Body, with recorded delivery) to protest their policies without receiving any reply. In 2011 I was involved in newspaper coverage (in the Independent) of Watchtower\u0027s shunning policies and hate language towards former members (calling such ones \u0022mentally diseased\u0022). The response of the organization in the UK at that time was to lie about their policies to the media. Since then I have disassociated myself from the organization in protest. At my apostasy trial in December 2013 the elders hearing my case flat-out refused to discuss doctrines or policy with me. Since leaving I have been punished by having my family coerced into shunning me in direct breach of my rights per article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. My baby daughter is now without an aunt (my sister) or a grandfather (my dad) thanks to this organization.\u0022\n\nI was only asked for my name, email and a phone number, so it should be relatively straightforward for most UK nationals to fill in this complaint form.\n\nRemember only THIRTEEN complaints were received against the Watchtower between March 2010 and March 2012, and this was enough to make them one of the top two most-complained-about organizations. Imagine what we can do if we all work together and make our voices heard!\n\nIf instead you want to tweet the charity commission, their main twitter account is @ChtyCommission\n\nHere is a link to the \u0022Third Sector\u0022 article about Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses being in the top-two most complained about charities... http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/news/1165755/jehovahs-witnesses-spiritual-healers-top-complaints-charity-commission/\n\nAnd here is a link to the Independent article on the child abuse case referred to in this video... http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/jehovahs-witness-abuse-victims-quizzed-by-their-attacker-at-church-9421040.html\n\nIf you are a representative of the Charity Commission watching this video and you would like to arrange to meet with me or review my evidence, please contact me at this email address: contact@jwsurvey.org",

As recently as 1947 the organization slammed the Catholic practice of excommunication as a \u0022weapon\u0022 that is \u0022altogether foreign to Bible teachings.\u0022\n\nThis Awake! magazine article can no longer be found on the JW.org website, or on the Watchtower Library CD-ROM, but scanned copies are available on the links below...\n\nPage 1 - http://jwsurvey.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/excommunicated.jpg\nPage 2 - http://jwsurvey.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/excommunicated2.jpg\n\nThen in 1952 the disfellowshipping (excommunication) practice was embraced by Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses as an \u0022arrangement that helps protect the congregation.\u0022 \n\nAs hypocritical a U-turn as this was, it was still better than the change that would be later introduced in the September 15, 1981 Watchtower magazine (p.23), which ordered that those who disassociated themselves as Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses were to be shunned as though they had sinned.\n\nThis change, which has remained in force ever since, makes it virtually impossible for Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses to leave the organization without facing punishment if they have believing family members who are still Witnesses.

To drive home her point, Kathleen is flanked by two senior SNAP officials, Barbara Dorris and David Clohessy, each of whom hold aloft print-outs of a Governing Body group photo.\n\nPointing to the photo, Kathleen says: \u0022These eight men who are called the Governing Body are responsible for creating every rule, regulation and policy that Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses live by. I can\u0027t emphasize this enough as being a Jehovah\u0027s Witness at one time. Obedience and loyalty to these eight men is not an option. It\u0027s a requirement.\u0022\n\nKathleen goes on to discuss the two-witness rule, according to which child abuse accusations are to be dismissed by elders if there is no witness to the abuse other than the victim (or a second victim of the same perpetrator). When watching the video, it is interesting to note Barbara Dorris\u0027 visible indignation at the two-witness rule as it is being explained.\n\nMore information on the link above.",

Does the Society have to pay the full $17 million now, or just the premium? If their appeal fails, do they have to pay the insurance company the $17 million in addition to the premium payments?\n\n(To Candace, asked by \u0022belbab\u0022) What principles or personal motives, biblical or otherwise, led you to pursue the case to the end without wanting to settle out of court?",

He leaked the letter to a handful of Anti-Watchtower activists, thereby triggering a chain of events that would culminate in the Watchtower getting several JW websites pulled offline for just over 24 hours because one of those websites (jwsurvey.org) had dared to publish their shameful letter for all to read. \n\nThe Watchtower does NOT want ordinary witnesses to find out about its woefully negligent policies regarding child abuse. This bizarre incident in January 2013 highlights just how paranoid, secretive and manipulative the Society and its Governing Body has become in its efforts to conceal the real truth about its policies from rank and file publishers.\n\nFor more information about the October 1st child abuse letter, please click on the link above.
