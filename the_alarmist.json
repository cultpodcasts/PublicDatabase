      "description": "Who\u2019s to blame for the Rise \u0026 Fall of the Onedia Community? This week, The Alarmist (Rebecca Delgado Smith) welcomes back writer Jane Borden, author of Cults Like Us: Why Doomsday Thinking Drives America , to discuss the rise and fall of the Oneida Community. It\u2019s highly likely you\u2019ve eaten a meal with a set of Oneida silverware. But, are you familiar with their cult origins and problematic sex practices like \u201CSticky Love\u201D or \u201CComplex Marriage?\u201D Were cults like these, which were very popular at this particular moment in history, a result of the industrial revolution and its billionaire class or an echo of our puritanical origins as a country? Fact Checker Chris Smith and Producer Clayton Early join the conversation. Join our Patreon!
