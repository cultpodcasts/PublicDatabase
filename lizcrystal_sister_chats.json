      "description": "Movie Discussion: Joe vs. the Volcano \u2013 Big Changes, Big Heart\n\nIn this episode of Sisters Chat, we\u2019re talking about one of our favorite weird little movies: Joe vs. the Volcano. It\u2019s funny, quirky, and totally out there \u2014 but underneath all the oddball moments is a story that hits home about times of big change needed.\n\nJoe\u2019s stuck in a dead-end job, feeling sick and drained by life, until he\u2019s told he\u2019s dying of a \u0022brain cloud\u0022 and agrees to jump into a volcano to appease the gods of a faraway island. Sounds ridiculous, right? But in saying yes to something completely wild, he unknowingly says yes to a whole new version of himself. On his way to the volcano, he finds adventure, love, and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 the courage to truly live. A true heroe\u0027s journey tale most can relate to. The journey of finding ourselves.\n\nWe talk about how Joe\u2019s journey mirrors some of our own \u2014 times we\u2019ve faced big changes or felt totally lost because of life or health concerns, only to be surprised by the new opportunities that came out of it that expanded our way of looking at waking up each day and finding purpose. That moment of stepping away from the life we thought we had to live... and realizing we get to choose joy. We get to wake up with purpose.\n\nThis one\u2019s full of laughs, real talk, and sisterly reflection. Whether you\u2019ve seen the movie or not, we think you\u2019ll connect with the themes \u2014 especially if you\u2019ve ever felt like you needed to leap into the unknown just to feel alive again.\n\nThank you for Being Here. It is an Honor to be Present.\n- Liz Salazar \u0026 Crystal Welsh\n\n#mentalhealth #podcast #innerresilience #courageousconversations #courage #changeisgrowth #change #nevergiveup #traumainformed #connection #sisters #healingtheinnerchild #youarenotalone #youmatter #adventureoflife #movies #joevsthevolcanomovie #resilience",

      "description": "Nervous System Regulation: From Fight-or-Flight-or Freeze to a more Empowered Emotional State \n\nLiz Salazar \u0026 Crystal Welsh discuss what Liz is learning in a nervous system regulation program. \nExploring through the discussion how to recognize triggering situations, understand the body\u2019s stress responses, and navigate tough moments with greater clarity and self compassion. \nThey talk about helpful tools and techniques like breath work that can be powerful tools for calming the body in moments when the nervous system is activated\u2014whether in fight, flight, or freeze. By learning to pause, breathe, and create SPACE between reaction and response, how we can gently shift \u0026 retrain our survival mode into a state of more regulated presence.\n\nLiz reflects on how this process is not just about managing stress, but about consciously evolving\u2014expanding our awareness, softening old patterns, and allowing our personality to shift in ways that bring more ease and emotional freedom. It literally feels like a miracle; as we evolve before our own eyes! We become more conscious of our inner self, our self talk, reactions, response emotions like extreme: sadness, anger, confusion, anxiety, that translate into outward expressions like we get quiet, we start to over explain looking for validation, we start to sweat or shake, get physically sick to our stomach. These are some of the ways the body and mind react when the nervous system is activated in an effort to protect ourselves. Through seeing how the nervous system works we can become more empowered to shape how we experience and respond to life.\n\nThank YOU for Being Here.

      "description": "Shift Your Mindset helps turn hardship into strength. While it may not change the past, it gives us the tools to reshape how we view it. We revisit the stories of growing up poor \u2014 not to relive the past, but to reframe it. Through honest reflections and raw moments, we explore how shifting our perspective can transform hardship into strength, shame into confidence, and struggle into resilience. We reflect on how doing charity work as kids led to a surprising realization: maybe we weren\u2019t as poor as we once thought compared to the children we were helping. Join us as we revisit these personal chapters, rewrite the narrative, and uncover the power of seeing our past through a new lens. Perspective is everything \u2014 and it can change the way we see ourselves and our journey.\n\nThank YOU for Being Here.
