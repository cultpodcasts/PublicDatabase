      "description": "Hulu\u2019s new series, The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives, has broken the internet after its controversial premiere last week. Mayci Neely joins us to open up about her experiences within the #MomTok group, from the initial nervousness to the unexpected controversies that emerged. Susie gives Mayci the floor to discuss the dynamics of being a Mormon in Salt Lake City, the intricacies of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and the stereotypes associated with it. \n\nThey discuss the reality behind the \u0027Secret Lives of Mormon Wives,\u0027 the viral success of Macy\u0027s social media posts, and the breakdown of personal boundaries and relationships within the #MomTok group. Of course, the two of them touch on the swinger scandal that rocked the internet and the ensuing personal journey Mayci went through, revealing her ambitions of providing for her family, starting a business, and possibly penning a book. (We\u2019d fully support that!)  \n\nFull of candid moments, heartfelt advice, and juicy confessions from Sinner Sundays, this episode gives a behind-the-scenes look at the life and challenges of a modern Mormon influencer.  \n\nLive, Laugh, Like \u0026 Follow:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/maycineeley/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/susiecevans/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/livelaughliespodcast/\n \nGo check out Baby Mama: https://www.babymama.co/  \nhttps://www.instagram.com/babymama.co/ \n\nSubmit your lies and juiciest stories at https://www.speakpipe.com/LiveLaughLiesVoicemail or livelaughliespodcast@gmail.com.  \n\nThank you to our awesome sponsors for supporting this episode:  \nCookUnity: Go to https://cookunity.com/LIVELAUGHLIES or enter code LIVELAUGHLIES before checkout for 50% off your first week.\nFungies: Go to https://eatfungies.com and use code LIVELAUGHLIES for shipping and 20% off.\nVIIA: Try VIIA Hemp!
