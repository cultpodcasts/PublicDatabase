      "title": "What the Epstein Files Reveal About How Elite Worlds Work | The Ezra Klein Show",
      "description": "At the end of January, Trump\u2019s Justice Department released what it said was the last tranche of the Epstein files: millions of pages of emails and texts, F.B.I. documents and court records. Much was redacted and millions more pages have been withheld. There is a lot we want to know that remains unclear.\n\nBut what has come into clear view is the role Epstein played as a broker of information, connections, wealth and women and girls for a slice of the global elite. This was the infrastructure of Epstein\u2019s power \u2014 and it reveals much about the infrastructure of elite networks more generally.\n\nAnand Giridharadas is something of a sociologist of American elites. He\u2019s the author of, among other books, \u201CWinners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World\u201D and the forthcoming \u201CMan in the Mirror: Hope, Struggle and Belonging in an American City.\u201D He also publishes the great newsletter The.Ink.\n\nBack in November, after the release of an earlier batch of Epstein files, Giridharadas wrote a great Times Opinion guest essay, taking a sociologist\u2019s lens to the messages Epstein exchanged with his elite friends. So after the government released this latest, enormous tranche of materials, I wanted to talk to Giridharadas to help make sense of it. What do they reveal \u2014 about how Epstein operated in the world, the vulnerabilities he exploited and what that says about how power works in America today? \n\nNote: This conversation was recorded on Tuesday, Feb. 10. On Thursday, Feb. 12, Kathryn Ruemmler announced she would be resigning from her role as chief legal officer and general counsel at Goldman Sachs.\n\n00:00 Intro\n6:50 Power lies where you don\u2019t expect \n10:40 Epstein was a broker of relationships\n15:34 Epstein\u2019s exploitation of gaps in our culture \n27:32 Concentric circles of enablement\n38:46 Epstein\u2019s \u201Ccatch me if you can\u201D approach\n47:14 Epstein\u2019s cultivated mystique and the men who were drawn to it\n1:08:45 The similar genius of Trump and Epstein \n1:12:26 The cowardice of elites in Trump\u2019s second term\n1:23:13 Book recommendations \n\nRead the full transcript here: https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/13/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-anand-giridharadas.html \n\nWatch more on @EzraKleinShow \n\nThoughts?
