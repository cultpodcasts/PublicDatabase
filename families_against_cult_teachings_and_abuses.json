Who hasn\u2019t felt fooled at least once in there lives? I want to make sure that resources and therapeutic programs are availabie for those who want to restart their lives and move forward.\n\nAfter receiving so many emails from victims of trafficking and high control groups looking for support and help in an effort to leave and reclaim their lives, I knew I wanted to do something to help.

As a result of Katsura Kan\u2019s manipulations my daughter is dead, and he is promoting Hitler.\n\nAmazingly, but not surprisingly, he was considered good enough to be hired by Naropa University in Boulder, CO, which is an accredited higher learning institution, where we believe he taught his students without any proper teachings credentials, the destructive dance of Butoh and its philosophy in the classroom which promoted pain, suffering, and death. We will look into what I believe is the undeserved accreditation of this university.\n\nThank you for watching,\n\nTibor Stern\nOn Behalf of the Sharoni Stern Estate\nPresident of F.A.C.T., Inc.\n\nFor more information, please visit: https://www.familiesagainstcultteachings.org/Memorial/",

      "description": "http://www.familiesagainstcultteachings.org   Teen Mania International was an Evangelical Christian youth organization located in Dallas, Texas (formally Garden Valley, Texas). Teen Mania focused primarily on four key programs, with a few additional smaller endeavors. It was one of the largest Christian youth organizations in the U.S.\n\nIts primary program included \u0022Acquire the Fire\u0022 events, described by one writer as \u0022a mix of pep rally, rock concert and church service,\u0022 that were held in over 30 cities across the United States and Canada each year. The ministry focused much of its energy towards its domestic and overseas mission trips, operated under the title \u0022Global Expeditions\u0022. Teen Mania previously operated a one-year-long residential leadership training program on its campus, titled the Honor Academy, aimed towards high school graduates, and college students.\n\nThe ministry faced criticism for its use of overtly militaristic symbolism, as well as techniques that have been compared as similar to military training. It has also been criticized by some former interns and employees for what they characterize as spiritual abuse and financial mismanagement. In its final years it faced significant financial difficulties, including a foreclosure on their campus, a lawsuit for breach of contract, and over $5.2 million in negative assets.\n\nThis video is uploaded under terms of the United States Fair Use Act of 1976, subsection 107, for educational purposes as a warning to those people caught up in religious cults.\n\nFor information about currently active destructive groups or to get help for yourself or a loved one, please visit our website: http://www.familiesagainstcultteachings.org",

      "description": "http://www.familiesagainstcultteachings.org  In turmoil following the break-up of a longtime relationship, David (Nick Mancuso) seeks something to give him a new direction and falls in with a religious cult. Before long, David has been completely brainwashed by the group and has receded from his old life. When his dedicated buddy, Larry (Saul Rubinek), tracks him down and discovers the reality of his situation, he proceeds to rally David\u0027s family and other friends to remove him from the cult and shake its influence.\n\nFrom the NY Times: \u0027\u0027TICKET TO HEAVEN\u0027\u0027 is an absorbing, frightening, entirely believable movie, which is particularly amazing in view of its subject matter. This is the story of a young man who is seduced into joining a religious cult, and it presents the group\u0027s indoctrination process in terms that are graphic, terrifyingly plausible and all too easy to understand. It is also the story of his friends and relatives\u0027 efforts to get him back, after he has become a near-zombie with close-cropped hair and a fierce but automatic dedication to the cult\u0027s leader. A credit at the end of the movie says this is fiction. That credit is the one thing about \u0027\u0027Ticket to Heaven\u0027\u0027 that is genuinely funny.\n\nFor information about currently active destructive groups or to get help for yourself or a loved one, please visit our website: http://www.familiesagainstcultteachings.org",

In this installment, we\u2019re going to dive into L. Ron Hubbard\u2019s creation and syphon out ten of the most interesting tidbits about the church, its beliefs, and some of its sordid past.\n\n10. The Human Spirit \n9. Thetans and Telekinesis \n8. The True Belief System was Once Hidden\n7. Scientologists Generally Shy Away from Xenu\n6. \u201CDisconnecting\u201D\n5. The Fight for Tax Exemption\n4. Germany Refuses to Recognize Scientology as a Religion\n3.

No names were released. \n\nhttp://www.familiesagainstcultteachings.org/News/Blog.php\n\n\u0022I would recommend to anyone that reads this that if someone tries to take you to this \u0027church,\u0027 run, run far and run fast because it will probably damage your life,\u0022 FACT quotes one anonymous source as saying.\n\nAnother anonymous source claims that Miller and church employees put pressure on congregants to give special donations to the pastor \u0022for Miller to use as he wishes,\u0022 while another alleges that church funds were used to send Miller and his family on vacations to \u0022Disney or Myrtle Beach.\u0022\n\nFACT claims that former church members complained of physical abuse, including repeated paddling and spankings, and that when people left the church, other church members --- including members of their own families --- were told by Miller to break off all contact with them.\n\nFor more information, visit http://www.familiesagainstcultteachings.org/News/Blog.php",

(F.A.C.T.) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to raising awareness and educating about destructive high-control / high-demand groups in the United States and abroad. Providing aid is also a top priority, for which we offer care, guidance, and various kinds of support for victims of undue influence, abuse (minor and adult), human trafficking (sex and labor) and exploitation of all kinds.\n\nNo one ever gets trapped in an abusive high-control group of their own free will. Initially, victims innocently join a church, a non-profit group trying to save the oceans, a self-help group or attend yoga classes. A child on the street gets pulled into a sex trafficking ring. A naive student in school gets recruited on campus. People are curious about practicing an Eastern religion or to learn meditation. \n\nAccording to the experts, there are over 5000 different high-control groups in the U.S. alone with more than four million members. FACT is one of the few organizations in existence whose mission it is to expose these groups for what they truly are and to help those afflicted by them. \n\n\nKEY OBJECTIVES:\n\n\u2022 Rescuing minors and adults from abusive high-control situations and groups\n\u2022 Education in high-schools / universities to inform and warn students\n\u2022 Providing guidance and support to families of victims in high-control groups\n\u2022 Working with the law to hold criminal groups accountable for their actions\n\u2022 Conducting investigative research on destructive groups\n\u2022 Creating and distributing educational awareness materials\n\u2022 Monitoring of news sources and sharing the information with the public\n\u2022 Holding anti-cult events to raise awareness with the general public",
