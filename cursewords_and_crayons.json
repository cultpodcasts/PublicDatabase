      "description": "Another day another horror. It\u2019s time for an episode of Cursewords and Crayons! A podcast where we talk about True Crime (and sometimes parenting), reminding everyone that it\u0027s what is on the inside that counts and sometimes the inside is just as rotten as the outside. This week we are kicking it back to episode 48 and talking about The Blackburn Cult. Lots of speculating, lots of whacky people, a lot of drams.
