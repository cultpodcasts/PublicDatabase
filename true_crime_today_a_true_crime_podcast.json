      "description": "Kevin Franke Speaks Out on Ex-Wife Ruby Franke\u2019s Crimes: \u2018I Have Regrets\u2019 Kevin Franke, the estranged husband of disgraced parenting influencer Ruby Franke, is breaking his silence following her conviction for child abuse. In a new interview, he admitted that he trusted his wife and her business partner, Jodi Hildebrandt, despite mounting concerns about their extreme parenting methods. \u201CThe bottom line is: I was choosing to trust a licensed professional mental health counselor and my wife, and they gave some terrible counsel,\u201D Franke told Good Morning America. \u201CAnd I have regrets. And I wish I hadn\u2019t done those things.\u201D Ruby Franke, 43, was once a celebrated mommy blogger with over 2.5 million subscribers on her YouTube channel, 8Passengers. Alongside Hildebrandt, she later founded ConneXions Classrooms, a parenting and lifestyle brand that offered paid counseling sessions and retreats. What was once a lucrative online business ultimately unraveled into a criminal case when authorities discovered two of Franke\u2019s children malnourished and restrained in Hildebrandt\u2019s home. The case shocked audiences familiar with Franke\u2019s strict parenting style, which had already raised red flags. In one of her earlier 8Passengers videos, her eldest son Chad casually revealed that he had been forced to sleep on a beanbag for seven months as punishment. After losing sponsors and facing backlash, Franke shifted to working with Hildebrandt, who encouraged even harsher parenting methods. In one resurfaced video from ConneXions Classrooms, Franke told parents, \u201CIf your child comes to you on fire, you don\u2019t pat them on the head and say, \u2018It\u2019s OK, I\u2019ll help you.\u2019 No, you beat them, and you kick them, and you hit them with a rod.\u201D Kevin Franke, a professor and father of six, said he was unaware of the extent of the abuse but now acknowledges that his wife\u2019s actions were dangerous. He last saw his children more than a year before Ruby\u2019s arrest in August 2023. The abuse allegations surfaced when Franke\u2019s 12-year-old son escaped from Hildebrandt\u2019s $5.3 million home in Ivins, Utah. The child, severely malnourished and bound with duct tape, ran to a neighbor for help, prompting an immediate police response. Authorities discovered another one of Franke\u2019s children, a 9-year-old girl, in similarly horrific condition. The case revealed years of disturbing practices, with Franke\u2019s eldest daughter, Shari, previously attempting to alert child services about the abuse. Both Ruby Franke and Jodi Hildebrandt pleaded guilty to four counts of aggravated child abuse and were sentenced to a minimum of 30 years in prison. Despite the horror of the case, Kevin Franke admitted that his feelings for Ruby are complicated. \u201CI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever stop loving her,\u201D he said. \u201CDoes that mean that I want to let her back into my life? Let her back into my kids\u2019 lives? Absolutely not.\u201D Kevin and his son Chad are now speaking out ahead of the release of Devil in the Family: The Fall of Ruby Franke, a new documentary detailing Ruby\u2019s rise and fall. The documentary includes never-before-seen clips of Franke\u2019s aggressive outbursts, painting a stark contrast to the polished image she portrayed online. Reflecting on the dangers of social media, Kevin Franke is now urging parents to reconsider exposing their families to the public eye. \u201CThere is real danger when you place yourself, or your family, your children, out onto public social media,\u201D he warned. The case has ignited broader discussions about parenting influencers, the ethics of monetizing family life, and the potential dangers of unregulated online advice. While Franke and Hildebrandt marketed their content as guidance for struggling parents, their convictions highlight the dark side of influencer culture, where financial incentives can overshadow child welfare. #KevinFranke #RubyFranke #JodiHildebrandt #TrueCrime #8Passengers #ConneXions #ParentingScandal Want to listen to ALL of our podcasts AD-FREE?

      "description": "Unmasking Ruby Franke FBI Expert Robin Dreeke Breaks Down Shari Franke Memoir Was family vlogging ever really about family\u2014or was it just another way to cash in on childhood innocence? Ruby Franke, once the face of the popular YouTube channel Eight Passengers, crafted a wholesome image of family life\u2014one that, according to her daughter, Sherry Franke, was a carefully curated front hiding something far darker. In her new memoir, The House of My Mother: A Daughter\u2019s Quest for Freedom, Sherry pulls back the curtain on the alleged abuse and control that shaped her upbringing, exposing the chilling reality behind the perfectly edited videos. But Ruby wasn\u2019t operating alone. Her husband, Kevin Franke, played his own role\u2014one that raises serious questions about willful ignorance and blind loyalty. How does a father just step away from his family under the guise of \u201Cself-improvement\u201D while another woman steps in to assume control? And what does it say when his return to reality comes with zero accountability? Retired FBI Special Agent Robin Dreeke joins the discussion, breaking down the psychological manipulation at play and the disturbing influence of Jodi Hildebrandt, the so-called therapist who only amplified Ruby\u2019s obsession with control. As more former child influencers come forward about their experiences, the question remains\u2014how many more kids are still trapped in this modern-day nightmare of parental exploitation disguised as entertainment? #TrueCrime #RubyFranke #EightPassengers #FamilyVlogging #KevinFranke #CultMentality #ChildExploitation Want to listen to ALL of our podcasts AD-FREE?

      "description": "On this episode, we dig into the shocking new lawsuit against Jodi Hildebrandt and Ruby Franke, which alleges that their ConneXions empire isn\u2019t dead\u2014it\u2019s still manipulating, isolating, and financially exploiting victims, even with its leaders behind bars. Filed by former client Michael Robert Tilleman, the lawsuit accuses Hildebrandt, Franke, and their network of running a racketeering operation disguised as therapy, using coercion and fear to control their followers. Even more disturbing, the lawsuit claims that ConneXions members continue to recruit and enforce Hildebrandt\u2019s harmful teachings, with some cases of child abuse allegedly still occurring. How does a system like this survive without its leaders, and can it finally be dismantled? We break it all down. Want to listen to ALL of our podcasts AD-FREE?

      "description": "Could a convicted cult leader actually get a new trial because of FBI misconduct? That\u2019s the question hanging over Keith Raniere\u2019s case, as allegations of tampered evidence and manipulated metadata surface. While the branding, coercion, and disturbing power dynamics of NXIVM are well-documented, former FBI agents now claim that crucial digital evidence\u2014particularly in relation to an alleged minor\u2014may have been altered. If true, does that mean Raniere gets a second shot at freedom, or does the mountain of other evidence against him still seal his fate? Defense attorney and former prosecutor Eric Faddis joins the discussion, breaking down what this could mean for the future of the case.
