      "title": "The Unraveling of Lori Vallow Daybell",
      "description": "The Unraveling of Lori Vallow Daybell Lori Vallow Daybell has spent years spinning her own version of events, but in an Arizona courtroom on Tuesday, the judge wasn\u2019t buying it. Already convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the murders of her two children, JJ Vallow and Tylee Ryan, and for conspiring to kill her husband\u2019s first wife, Tammy Daybell, Lori is now facing more charges\u2014this time in Arizona. She\u2019s accused of murdering her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, and conspiring to kill her niece\u2019s ex-husband, Brandon Boudreaux. And if Tuesday\u2019s hearing was any indication, things aren\u2019t exactly going in her favor. Lori, representing herself, started by asking the judge to ban cameras from the courtroom, arguing that the media coverage of her case has been \u201Cinherently prejudicial.\u201D She specifically called out Court TV, claiming their coverage has falsely shaped public perception and turned her into some kind of spectacle. Judge Justin Beresky listened but made it clear he was leaning toward allowing a single camera with restrictions\u2014no zooming in on notes, just a straightforward courtroom feed. Then Lori moved on to jury selection, requesting that potential jurors be questioned individually instead of in groups. She claimed her previous trial in Idaho required screening nearly 2,000 jurors and worried that people would try to get on this jury just for the attention. The judge didn\u2019t seem convinced that a change was necessary but took her concerns under advisement. One of the biggest blows to Lori\u2019s defense came when she tried to introduce statements from her brother, Alex Cox, as evidence. Cox, who shot and killed Charles Vallow in 2019, initially claimed self-defense, but Lori wanted his statements admitted in court. The judge shut that down quickly, ruling that not only were the statements hearsay, but Lori\u2014having been convicted of conspiring in Cox\u2019s actions\u2014was legally prohibited from using his words as evidence in her defense. Lori also pushed for additional evidence from the prosecution, demanding access to certain police recordings and conversations that she claimed exist. The judge told prosecutors to check again but made it clear that if they said they didn\u2019t have the material, he couldn\u2019t force them to produce it. Then came the issue of time. With jury selection set for March 31, Lori reminded the court that her speedy trial deadline was May 11 and insisted that the trial needed to move forward within that time frame. But Judge Beresky overruled her, waiving the deadline over her objection and pointing out that both sides had acknowledged the impossibility of trying two complex cases at once. The next hearing is set for March 18, where both sides will argue over remaining issues, including whether Lori can bring in a digital forensics expert for her defense. But after Tuesday\u2019s hearing, one thing is clear\u2014Lori may be running the show in her own mind, but in court, she\u2019s losing control fast. #LoriVallow #DoomsdayMom #TrueCrime #Justice Want to listen to ALL of our podcasts AD-FREE?

      "description": "Breaking Down The Beliefs of Chad \u0026 Lori Vallow Daybell Part 1 How It Started ORIGINS \u0026 BELIEF DEVELOPMENT The story of Chad Daybell and Lori Vallow didn\u2019t start with murder\u2014it started with faith twisted into fanaticism. In this episode, we explore the LDS Church\u2019s core beliefs, how mainstream Mormonism views prophecy and the Second Coming, and how Chad and Lori veered from religious devotion into dangerous extremism. Chad\u2019s near-death experiences convinced him he had access to divine knowledge, while Lori\u2019s obsession with end-times prophecy led her to believe she was a goddess chosen to gather the righteous. How did a simple belief in personal revelation and spiritual preparedness turn into an apocalyptic worldview that justified murder? We break down Chad\u2019s early writings, his rise in LDS prepping circles, and how fiction became fact in his mind. We also examine Lori\u2019s transformation from a devoted Mormon mother to a self-proclaimed leader of the 144,000. By tracking their path from faith to fanaticism, we expose the psychological and religious factors that led them to classify people as \u201Clight\u201D or \u201Cdark,\u201D ultimately determining who lived and who died. Through expert analysis and firsthand accounts, this episode lays the groundwork for understanding how a dangerous cult ideology took root within the framework of a mainstream religion. How did their beliefs develop? What warning signs were ignored? And could this have been stopped before it spiraled into murder? Want to listen to ALL of our podcasts AD-FREE?

The Ruby Franke case has left many stunned, but the focus now shifts to her husband, Kevin\u2014a man who still claims to love the woman who tortured their children. While he insists he was a victim of religious coercion and extreme psychological control, many argue he was complicit, neglectful, and far too passive.\n\nWith a new Hulu documentary shedding light on his role, Kevin is scrambling to explain his inaction. Was he brainwashed by the cult-like influence of Jodi Hildebrandt and the rigid authority of his faith? Or was he just a man too weak to stand up for his own kids?

      "description": "Convicted YouTuber Ruby Franke Left Journal Detailing Abuse of Her \u2018Demonic\u2019 Children Before Ruby Franke, the infamous YouTube mom behind the \u00228Passengers\u0022 channel, pleaded guilty to child abuse charges, authorities uncovered something chilling\u2014a handwritten journal detailing the suffering she inflicted on her own children. In it, she described acts of cruelty with a detachment that made even seasoned investigators pause. As revealed in Hulu\u2019s new docuseries Devil in the Family: The Fall of Ruby Franke, a police investigator reads from the journal, bringing Franke\u2019s own words into the open. One entry is particularly disturbing: \u0022Sleep outside, shaved her head, doused her with water, over his nose and mouth, head in the toilet, needs to be painful. Blood on his face, scream and scream.\u0022 Another entry is no less horrifying: \u0022I told the boy, he emulates a snake. If he wants to emulate the Savior, he needs to be a hundred percent obedient with exactness. The body must engage in good work and the good works need to be painful. I have the power of God and he must obey.\u0022 The extent of the abuse detailed in these pages is staggering. In one passage, Franke wrote about forcing her son into the sun, then returning with a \u0022cactus poker\u0022 to prod him. She recorded her own twisted logic: \u0022When I poke his back to get in the sun, he doesn\u2019t even flinch. I told him, give your demon friend a message for me. I will not rest. I will not stop. I will not leave. I will fight him until the day you die.\u0022 These weren\u2019t the ramblings of someone suffering a temporary lapse in judgment. They were calculated. Premeditated. Written down as if she was keeping a ledger of pain. In August 2023, it all came to an end when Franke\u2019s 12-year-old son escaped from the home she shared with her business partner, Jodi Hildebrandt. Starving, injured, and desperate, he ran to a neighbor and pleaded for help. The neighbor, moved to tears by the boy\u2019s skeletal appearance, called 911. Soon after, authorities discovered his 9-year-old sister inside Hildebrandt\u2019s home in an equally horrific condition. Franke and her husband, Kevin, had gained a massive following through \u00228Passengers,\u0022 where their brand of strict, authoritarian parenting was often defended as tough love. Their content, which amassed over 2 million subscribers, frequently walked the fine line between discipline and outright cruelty. YouTube ultimately shut down the channel after Franke\u2019s arrest. Kevin Franke was not charged in connection with the abuse. Jodi Hildebrandt, Franke\u2019s business partner and a former therapist, only made things worse. The founder of the so-called \u0022ConneXions\u0022 program, a religious-based self-help movement, Hildebrandt reportedly encouraged extreme parenting methods, preying on vulnerabilities within the Mormon community. According to a therapist featured in the docuseries, Hildebrandt \u0022was excellent at exploiting Mormon anxiety.\u0022 Her influence, combined with Franke\u2019s already dangerous beliefs, created a toxic and violent environment for the children trapped in their care. Both Franke and Hildebrandt pleaded guilty to four counts of aggravated child abuse. Their sentences\u2014ranging from four to 30 years\u2014will be decided by the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole. At her sentencing, Franke broke down in tears, addressing her children directly. \u0022I will never stop crying for hurting your tender souls,\u0022 she said. But the damage was already done.

      "description": "Kevin Franke Speaks Out on Ex-Wife Ruby Franke\u2019s Crimes: \u2018I Have Regrets\u2019 Kevin Franke, the estranged husband of disgraced parenting influencer Ruby Franke, is breaking his silence following her conviction for child abuse. In a new interview, he admitted that he trusted his wife and her business partner, Jodi Hildebrandt, despite mounting concerns about their extreme parenting methods. \u201CThe bottom line is: I was choosing to trust a licensed professional mental health counselor and my wife, and they gave some terrible counsel,\u201D Franke told Good Morning America. \u201CAnd I have regrets. And I wish I hadn\u2019t done those things.\u201D Ruby Franke, 43, was once a celebrated mommy blogger with over 2.5 million subscribers on her YouTube channel, 8Passengers. Alongside Hildebrandt, she later founded ConneXions Classrooms, a parenting and lifestyle brand that offered paid counseling sessions and retreats. What was once a lucrative online business ultimately unraveled into a criminal case when authorities discovered two of Franke\u2019s children malnourished and restrained in Hildebrandt\u2019s home. The case shocked audiences familiar with Franke\u2019s strict parenting style, which had already raised red flags. In one of her earlier 8Passengers videos, her eldest son Chad casually revealed that he had been forced to sleep on a beanbag for seven months as punishment. After losing sponsors and facing backlash, Franke shifted to working with Hildebrandt, who encouraged even harsher parenting methods. In one resurfaced video from ConneXions Classrooms, Franke told parents, \u201CIf your child comes to you on fire, you don\u2019t pat them on the head and say, \u2018It\u2019s OK, I\u2019ll help you.\u2019 No, you beat them, and you kick them, and you hit them with a rod.\u201D Kevin Franke, a professor and father of six, said he was unaware of the extent of the abuse but now acknowledges that his wife\u2019s actions were dangerous. He last saw his children more than a year before Ruby\u2019s arrest in August 2023. The abuse allegations surfaced when Franke\u2019s 12-year-old son escaped from Hildebrandt\u2019s $5.3 million home in Ivins, Utah. The child, severely malnourished and bound with duct tape, ran to a neighbor for help, prompting an immediate police response. Authorities discovered another one of Franke\u2019s children, a 9-year-old girl, in similarly horrific condition. The case revealed years of disturbing practices, with Franke\u2019s eldest daughter, Shari, previously attempting to alert child services about the abuse. Both Ruby Franke and Jodi Hildebrandt pleaded guilty to four counts of aggravated child abuse and were sentenced to a minimum of 30 years in prison. Despite the horror of the case, Kevin Franke admitted that his feelings for Ruby are complicated. \u201CI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever stop loving her,\u201D he said. \u201CDoes that mean that I want to let her back into my life? Let her back into my kids\u2019 lives? Absolutely not.\u201D Kevin and his son Chad are now speaking out ahead of the release of Devil in the Family: The Fall of Ruby Franke, a new documentary detailing Ruby\u2019s rise and fall. The documentary includes never-before-seen clips of Franke\u2019s aggressive outbursts, painting a stark contrast to the polished image she portrayed online. Reflecting on the dangers of social media, Kevin Franke is now urging parents to reconsider exposing their families to the public eye. \u201CThere is real danger when you place yourself, or your family, your children, out onto public social media,\u201D he warned. The case has ignited broader discussions about parenting influencers, the ethics of monetizing family life, and the potential dangers of unregulated online advice. While Franke and Hildebrandt marketed their content as guidance for struggling parents, their convictions highlight the dark side of influencer culture, where financial incentives can overshadow child welfare. #KevinFranke #RubyFranke #JodiHildebrandt #TrueCrime #8Passengers #ConneXions #ParentingScandal Want to listen to ALL of our podcasts AD-FREE?

      "description": "Unmasking Ruby Franke FBI Expert Robin Dreeke Breaks Down Shari Franke Memoir Was family vlogging ever really about family\u2014or was it just another way to cash in on childhood innocence? Ruby Franke, once the face of the popular YouTube channel Eight Passengers, crafted a wholesome image of family life\u2014one that, according to her daughter, Sherry Franke, was a carefully curated front hiding something far darker. In her new memoir, The House of My Mother: A Daughter\u2019s Quest for Freedom, Sherry pulls back the curtain on the alleged abuse and control that shaped her upbringing, exposing the chilling reality behind the perfectly edited videos. But Ruby wasn\u2019t operating alone. Her husband, Kevin Franke, played his own role\u2014one that raises serious questions about willful ignorance and blind loyalty. How does a father just step away from his family under the guise of \u201Cself-improvement\u201D while another woman steps in to assume control? And what does it say when his return to reality comes with zero accountability?

      "description": "On this episode, we dig into the shocking new lawsuit against Jodi Hildebrandt and Ruby Franke, which alleges that their ConneXions empire isn\u2019t dead\u2014it\u2019s still manipulating, isolating, and financially exploiting victims, even with its leaders behind bars. Filed by former client Michael Robert Tilleman, the lawsuit accuses Hildebrandt, Franke, and their network of running a racketeering operation disguised as therapy, using coercion and fear to control their followers. Even more disturbing, the lawsuit claims that ConneXions members continue to recruit and enforce Hildebrandt\u2019s harmful teachings, with some cases of child abuse allegedly still occurring. How does a system like this survive without its leaders, and can it finally be dismantled? We break it all down. Want to listen to ALL of our podcasts AD-FREE?

      "description": "Could a convicted cult leader actually get a new trial because of FBI misconduct? That\u2019s the question hanging over Keith Raniere\u2019s case, as allegations of tampered evidence and manipulated metadata surface. While the branding, coercion, and disturbing power dynamics of NXIVM are well-documented, former FBI agents now claim that crucial digital evidence\u2014particularly in relation to an alleged minor\u2014may have been altered. If true, does that mean Raniere gets a second shot at freedom, or does the mountain of other evidence against him still seal his fate? Defense attorney and former prosecutor Eric Faddis joins the discussion, breaking down what this could mean for the future of the case. If the FBI cut corners, should it matter when the defendant is someone like Keith Raniere? #NXIVM #KeithRaniere #TrueCrime #FBI #EvidenceTampering #CultMindset #Justice Want to listen to ALL of our podcasts AD-FREE?
