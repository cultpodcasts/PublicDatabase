      "description": "Join Nancy and me as we dive into the latest episode of The Key of David, where Gerald Flurry delves deep into the biblical significance of the number 40. From Moses\u0027 40 years in the wilderness to the 40 acres of church property, Flurry presents 40 as a divine sign woven throughout scripture and modern events.\nBut is there more to this number than meets the eye? We\u0027ll explore the literary and symbolic uses of 40 in ancient texts, shedding light on how this number often represents periods of testing or transformation, rather than a literal count. We\u0027ll also touch on how numerology enthusiasts interpret 40, adding another layer to this fascinating discussion.\nTune in as we unpack the layers of meaning behind the number 40, separating fact from fiction, and offering our own insights into this numerological journey.\n\nTonight\u0027s Propaganda: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu-V4DtDXXs\u0026t=135s\n\n\uD83C\uDFBA Expect:\nKazoo music to drown out the silly.\nRomper Bomper mirror moments for everyone in the chat\nPartying like only ex-culties can!!\n\n\uD83D\uDD25 Like, comment, and subscribe if you\u2019ve ever fled a Flurry.\n\nThis video contains material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

Our goal isn\u2019t to debate what\u2019s \u0022right,\u0022 but to compassionately examine what kids actually need to thrive: safety, support, freedom, and access to meaningful learning.\n\nBrently shares his experience with fundamentalist homeschooling and his evolving support for public education when done well. AJ speaks about homeschooling her neurodivergent, non-binary child\u2014and the relief of building an environment free from bullying. Nancy reflects on the challenges of traditional school as someone with attention struggles. And Patti holds space for the idea that education should meet the whole child, not just a standardized outcome.\n\nWe even end with a moment of awe\u2014watching a short video of AJ\u2019s child flying a small plane. Because learning doesn\u2019t just happen in classrooms\u2014it happens in the skies, the kitchen, on walks, in books, in conversation, and in all the curious corners of a child\u2019s world.\n\nGuests: @PunkApostate \u0026 @WaysToHuman \n\n\uD83C\uDFA7 This episode is for you if:\n\nYou\u2019re exploring or questioning homeschooling\n\nYou\u0027re raising a neurodivergent or gender-expansive kid\n\nYou grew up in a religious or fundamentalist home\n\nYou\u2019re curious about education that liberates instead of controls\n\nLet\u2019s ask better questions about how and where we learn\u2014and what kind of world we want to help our kids grow into.\n\n\uD83D\uDC4D Like, Subscribe, \u0026 Hit the Bell to support our work!\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks like Behind-the-Scenes footage and :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNwaIjyXNJ2KuE8G-K8nlNg/join\n\nSupport the Sisters\u2019 work on Patreon: \npatreon.com/ApostateSisters\n\n\uD83D\uDCE2 Follow Us on Social Media: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/apostatesisters/\nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@apostatesisters\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ApostateSisters/\nBlueSky: https://bsky.app/profile/apostatesisters.bsky.social\n\nDisclaimer:\nThis episode may contain irreverent, personal, and critical discussion of religion, culture, and systems of control.

From exchanging hilarious livestream props (yes, a kazoo and a b0ob toy were involved) to meeting amazing creators like Punk Apostate Damien AtHope,  Kitty the Atheist, Godless Engineer, Godless Granny, and new friend Casey, surprise rapper Propha-C \u2014this weekend was packed with joy, laughter, and real connection.\n\nWe also reflect on how content creators bridge the gap between local secular communities and online audiences, and how conferences like FreeFlo and BAHACon play a huge role in building those bridges. Plus, we shout out Seth Andrews, Forrest Valkai, and look ahead to future events like Shameless Sexuality Online Conference (info at www.shamelesssexuality.org) and the Ark Encounter protest in Kentucky this July.\n\nThis one\u0027s full of heart, humor, and hope\u2014just like the best parts of being human.\n\n\uD83D\uDC4D Like, Subscribe, \u0026 Hit the Bell to support our work!\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks like Behind-the-Scenes footage and :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNwaIjyXNJ2KuE8G-K8nlNg/join\n\nSupport the Sisters\u2019 work by buying digital products on Patreon: \npatreon.com/ApostateSisters/shop\n\n\uD83D\uDCE2 Follow Us on Social Media: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/apostatesisters/\nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@apostatesisters\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ApostateSisters/\nBlueSky: https://bsky.app/profile/apostatesisters.bsky.social\n\nDisclaimer:\nThis episode may contain irreverent, personal, and critical discussion of religion, culture, and systems of control.

Today, we\u2019re thrilled to introduce you to the spirited and thought-provoking Helen Greene of Freethinker Fireside.\n\nHelen\u2019s journey is nothing short of remarkable. She grew up Catholic, embraced Paganism as a high priestess, and now, as a queer humanist activist, she dedicates her platform to challenging societal norms and fostering inclusive, critical conversations. Helen\u2019s vibrant personality shines through as she discusses the power of ritual, self-empowerment, and her journey from faith to freedom.\n\nWe didn\u2019t hold back in this lively and candid interview!

John shares his deeply personal journey, starting with his Catholic upbringing, which often made him feel guilty and unworthy, despite not being overly religious. He explains how his friendships at school pulled him into Christianity and how he wrestled with faith for years, feeling that being Christian was the key to acceptance and being \u0022good enough.\u0022\n\nJohn courageously opens up about his battle with clinical depression, the pressure to conform, and how therapy has been transformative in helping him find peace and purpose.

      "description": "Welcome to another fiery conversation with the Apostate Sisters! This time, we\u2019re diving into the tangled mess that is Purity Culture \u2013 that set of beliefs that told us our bodies belonged to God, our parents, or a future spouse, but certainly not to ourselves. Growing up in the Worldwide Church of God, purity wasn\u2019t just about abstaining from sex; it was about surrendering every ounce of bodily autonomy. In this episode, we share our personal experiences and dissect the messages that trained us to disconnect from our own bodies.\n\nWe talk about how purity culture is woven with manipulation tactics, shame, and fear \u2013 and we explore the serious psychological and relational consequences of growing up under these beliefs. From modesty expectations and guilt-ridden messages to the toxic idea that \u201Cpurity\u201D equals worthiness, we break down the impact these teachings had on our lives and the lives of so many others.\n\nJoin us as we reclaim our autonomy, call out the harm, and share steps toward healing. This one\u2019s for everyone who\u2019s been made to feel like their body was anything other than their own. Ready to challenge these damaging ideas?

With its over-the-top wholesome vibe and oddly staged smiles, it\u2019s clear that Herbert W. Armstrong had a vision of \u0022perfection\u0022 that was as controlling as it was unsettling. From the forced cheer to the choreographed moves, the whole setup feels like an eerie attempt to project an image of moral superiority and \u0022purity.\u0022\nJoin us as we cringe, laugh, and dissect the ways high-control groups often use aesthetics to enforce conformity and create a carefully curated \u0022perfect\u0022 world.

This time, Nancy and Patti are diving deep into a tough but necessary topic: spanking and physical punishment, and how these practices intersect with bodily autonomy, especially in high-control environments like the Worldwide Church of God (WCG). Growing up in a church where authority and obedience were emphasized, many of us were raised to accept physical punishment as \u0022normal\u0022 or even \u0022loving\u0022 discipline. But what are the real impacts of this practice on our sense of self, safety, and autonomy?\n\nIn this episode, we discuss:\n\nOur personal stories around spanking in WCG and evangelical households.\nHow spanking was justified by religious teachings and cultural norms, especially passages like \u0022spare the rod, spoil the child.\u0022\nThe psychological toll of corporal punishment on children, including struggles with self-worth, boundaries, and bodily autonomy.\nA look at shifting societal views on physical discipline and alternative, non-violent approaches to parenting.\nJoin us as we unpack the complex layers of spanking, authority, and control, and how we can reclaim our bodies and minds from these lasting imprints.

      "description": "Join us in this entertaining interview with Kara Reynolds, the brilliant author of \u0022Priestess.\u0022 A writer, watercolor artist, and a survivor of a high-control church group, Kara Reynolds connects with themes of deconstruction and self-reclamation through her latest book, \u0022Priestess,\u0022 perfectly aligning with our mission at the Apostate Sisters. In \u0022Priestess,\u0022 Kara explores the long-lasting effects of religious trauma through the lens of romantic fantasy, set in a fantastical world with a quasi-dark ages setting.\n\nIn this episode, we discuss how \u0022Priestess\u0022 unpacks the complexities of religious trauma and personal empowerment, resonating deeply with anyone who has faced similar journeys of faith and identity. We note the underlying theme of women who help each other, instead of fight each other. Kara shares her inspiration, the feedback that led her to self-publish, and her thoughts on navigating spirituality post-trauma.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a fan of fantasy literature, interested in stories of personal growth, or seeking to understand the impact of religious upbringing, this interview is a must-watch. Tune in to hear how Kara\u2019s work echoes our own experiences and aims to support others on their path to healing and self-discovery.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to like, comment, and subscribe for more insightful discussions and stories.\n\nFind Kara: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/karaneedstoread/\nFind the Book: \nAmazon: https://a.co/d/0NaNHl5\nGoodreads: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/204988997-priestess\n\n#Priestess #KaraReynolds #ApostateSisters #ReligiousTrauma #SelfReclamation #FantasyLiterature #SpiritualHealing",

      "description": "Welcome to a new episode of the Apostate Sisters Interview Series, where we hold space for the life stories of those who were once entangled in the web of the Worldwide Church of God. Today, we\u0027re joined by David Ward, who was introduced to the church in his early childhood in the mid-1960s and left as a teenager in the late 1970s.\n\nRaised in a family deeply committed to the church after his father discovered \u0022The Plain Truth\u0022 magazine, David\u0027s upbringing was steeped in the doctrines and practices of the church, from observing the Sabbath to attending the impressive Ambassador Auditorium for holy days. Despite the church\u0027s deep influence, David recounts his journey with a reflective and critical eye, especially discussing his transition away from these beliefs during his pursuit of higher education.\n\nToday, while his mother and some siblings still observe the church\u0027s teachings, David identifies as an atheist, maintaining a nuanced view of his time within the church. This episode explores the complex dynamics of growing up in a cult, the allure of questioning, and the path to personal freedom. Join us as David shares insights into the everyday life aspects of cult membership, including youth camps, relationships, and the impact of church doctrines on personal decisions like dating and education.\n\nDavid\u0027s story is a testament to the power of questioning and the search for personal truth. As we unpack his experiences, we invite our listeners to reflect on their own journeys and the impact of religious teachings on personal growth and freedom.",

Armstrong series, what was intended to be a concluding exploration into the transformative 1990s within the Worldwide Church of God took an unexpected, deeply personal turn. Join us, the Apostate Sisters, as we explore the profound impact of Armstrongist church ideals on our family relationships. As we navigate through the history and the significant changes that swept through the church in the 1990s, we find ourselves reflecting on the personal toll these doctrines have taken. This episode becomes a candid space for acknowledging the harm inflicted by the church\u0027s teachings and the difficult process of deconstructing these experiences.

As survivors and former cult children, we, Patti, Nancy, and Joel bring unique insights and raw commentary on the writings of cult leader Herbert W. Armstrong. These texts played a crucial role in our parents\u0027 indoctrination and shaped our lives until we broke free.\n\nFor our premiere episode, we tackle \u0022The Missing Dimension in Sex,\u0022 a book notorious for its prudish yet paradoxically explicit discourse on what Herbert W. Armstrong deemed the \u0027New Morality.\u0027 Prepare for a rollercoaster of emotions as we dissect the bombastic language, doublespeak, contradictions, and disempowering messages peppered throughout this text. Not shying away from the nitty-gritty, this book dives into the mechanics of sex in a way that\u0027s as detailed as it is cringeworthy.\n\nGet ready to laugh, cringe, and maybe even get offended as we revel in our freedom, boldness, and the grand scale of our apostasy.

Armstrong\u2019s vision of the \u0022right society\u0022 through his distinctly Western-centric lens. The Apostate Sisters and MisterDiffiCULT dissect a passage where Armstrong champions his ideals, which reflect a narrow and biased viewpoint on societal structure.\n\nThis short video spotlights the critical discussion we have about the implications of such a biased perspective and how it shaped the teachings and practices within the Worldwide Church of God. Armstrong\u0027s views on building a society are not just dated but are steeped in a Western-centric ideology that we unpack with both seriousness and a touch of our signature irreverent humor.\n\n\uD83D\uDCCC Want to hear more of our thoughts on Armstrong\u0027s teachings and their impact on followers?

Armstrong\u0027s controversial views on sexual repression, as detailed in his book \u0022The Missing Dimension in Sex.\u0022 While Armstrong argues that societal sexual repression has led to a form of \u0027sex craziness,\u0027 we, the Apostate Sisters along with MisterDiffiCULT, find ourselves in a complex position of both agreeing and challenging his perspectives.\n\nJoin us as we navigate this provocative discussion, dissecting Armstrong\u0027s assertions with our unique blend of humor, insight, and irreverence. This clip offers just a taste of the critical and sometimes hilarious dialogue we engage in as we unpack the bizarre and often contradictory teachings from our former cult.\n\n\n\n#UnPackIt #ApostateSisters #MisterDiffiCULT #SexualRepression #CultLiterature #HerbertWArmstrong",

We explore the human aspect behind the spectacle, shedding light on the personal stories of those who grew up under the shadow of Armstrong\u0027s prophecy, particularly the year 1975, which was predicted to bring the end but instead left a legacy of confusion and disillusionment. This episode doesn\u0027t just recount historical facts; it aims to give voice to the silent echoes of childhoods spent in preparation for an apocalypse that never came. We focus on the real human cost of Armstrong\u0027s teachings, the individuals still grappling with the remnants of fear instilled from a young age, and those finding themselves ensnared in the web of Armstrongist cults today.

      "description": "In this first episode of a new series, we begin the riveting history of Herbert W. Armstrong. Nancy and Patti study the enigmatic founder of the Worldwide Church of God, through Nancy\u0027s detailed spreadsheet that requires Patti to don her reading glasses. As Nancy sips on bourbon, the sisters explore the religious movements dating back to the 1600s, unraveling the threads that may have woven together to shape their own childhood experiences within the cult.\n\n\n\nWe take you on a journey from Armstrong\u0027s early days in the Midwest, where he honed his skills in sales, and then to Oregon, where his \u0027pioneering\u0027 venture into a radio program put him into the public eye and would eventually launch the Worldwide Church of God. The episode sheds light on the historical and cultural influences that Armstrong encountered throughout his life, offering insights into how these elements fused together to form the doctrines and practices that impacted countless lives.\n\n\n\nJoin us, the Apostate Sisters, for an hour of history, analysis, and personal reflection, as we dissect the life of a man whose legacy is as controversial as it is captivating. Whether you\u0027re a former member of the Worldwide Church of God, a history buff, or simply intrigued by the dizzying clusterf*ck of religious movements, this episode promises to deliver the Sisters\u0027 irreverent style.\n\n\n\nDon\u0027t miss out on this deep dive into the life of Herbert W. Armstrong. Subscribe, like, and share your thoughts in the comments below.

Growing up in a religious environment where the pursuit of truth was paramount, Patti embarked on a journey to understand the world more deeply, only to find discrepancies between what the Bible claimed and the realities of the world.\nThis is not just Patti\u0027s story; it\u0027s a conversation starter for anyone who has ever dared to question their faith, seek answers beyond religious texts, and find their own path in the pursuit of truth. #Deconversion #SeekingTruth #ReligiousQuestioning #ApostateSisters #FaithJourney #TheBibleIsCulturalFiction",

As we look back on our journey away from a rigid faith, we uncover the layers of embarrassment associated with the practices we once held dear, recognizing the ridiculousness and societal harm of our previous beliefs.\nThis candid clip is a light-hearted glimpse into the deeper conversations we have about the evolution of our beliefs, the things we once did in the name of faith, and how we\u0027ve come to see the error and harm in those actions. It\u0027s a relatable journey for anyone who\u0027s ever reflected on their past with a mix of disbelief and growth.\nJoin us as we laugh, cringe, and reflect on the paths we\u0027ve taken from devout believers to critical thinkers, shedding light on the often ridiculous and harmful aspects of our former faith. #ExCult #FaithJourney #ReligiousDeconstruction #CringeConfessions #ApostateSisters",
