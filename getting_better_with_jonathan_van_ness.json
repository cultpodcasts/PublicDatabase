      "description": "Why do smart, curious people join cults? JVN is joined by investigative journalist Ellen Huet, who spent years interviewing more than 125 former members to expose how a movement built around empowerment, intimacy, and \u201Csexual wellness\u201D spiraled into coercion, manipulation, and abuse of power. Together, we break down how wellness culture can blur boundaries, why charismatic leaders are so effective, and how language around healing and liberation can be weaponized. They explore what OneTaste and Orgasmic Meditation (O.M.) actually promised, how social pressure and taboo minimization kept people trapped, and what finally led to an FBI investigation and federal trial. Most importantly, we talk about why smart, curious people join cults, how to spot red flags before it\u2019s too late, and what to do if someone you love might be caught in one.
