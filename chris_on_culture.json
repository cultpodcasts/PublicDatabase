      "title": "Francesca Fiorentini Takes Down MAGA Cultist Tulsi Gabbard!",
      "description": "In this enthralling video, Francesca Fiorentini and a guest discussed the possibility that Tulsi Gabbard may be in a cult. Francesca\u0027s guest - a journalist who covers cults - explained that Tulsi Gabbard\u0027s parents were in a cult which Tulsi never left.\n\nOn Francesca Fiorentini\u0027s show, The Bitchuation Room, they broke down how this may affect Tulsi\u0027s involvement with Donald Trump\u0027s cabinet. Could there be a tug of war behind the cult leader that Tulsi Gabbard grew up with and the biggest cult leader in the world - the head of the cult of MAGA?\n\nThis is a must-see video to see this case made. Francesca Fiorentini is sure to continue to cover the wackiness of figures like Tulsi Gabbard and all the other kooks involved with MAGA.\n\n#tulsigabbard #donaldtrump #francescafiorentini #samseder #anakasparian",
