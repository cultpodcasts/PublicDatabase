Big thank you.\n\n\u2014-\n\nCHARITY x GIVEAWAY Link:\n\nhttps://dheg4change.myshopify.com/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nScientology has seemingly remained a secret since the start of its existence in the 1950\u0027s. It is not often that we as a society hear many things about this \u0027religion\u0027 unless, perhaps, negative comments in association with a \u0027cult\u0027. I decided to dive head first into the process of \u0027joining\u0027 along with my homie \u200B\u2060\u202A@3rdeyeomen596 \u202C , where we have attempted to journalise footage that not many have successfully obtained. This is based off OUR own experience in our time in the Church of Scientology closest to us. \n\n   This is part 2/2 of the series and if you haven\u0027t checked out part 1, please do so as these took months to make. I look forward to sharing similar sidequest X commentary content with y\u0027all. PEACE!\n\nFollow our instagrams:\n@emirnoballer\n@3rdeyeomenn666\n\nALL INQUIRIES x SPONSORSHIPS x COLLABS EMAIL\n\nDhegrecords@gmail.com",

      "description": "Having been around for decades, what goes on inside Scientology has remained nothing short of a mystery. There has been VERY FEW instances of people \u2018joining\u2019 this community and being able to release any visuals or info. We decided to journalize OUR own experience with attending these meetings \u0026 events as well as completing and getting an insight on tests, audits, events, purification, and interviews with the Sea Org. Time is money, though Scientology is practically a Religion that lets you level up based on your financial contributions to the church, so here\u2019s an inside view of how much TIME we spent in our City\u2019s brand new Church Of Scientology\u2026\n\n  \u2014\u2014-This is video 1 of 2, so stay tuned\u2014\u2014-\n\nFOR ALL INQUIRIES/SPONSORSHIPS EMAIL\ndhegrecords@gmail.com\n\nMy socials:\nTiktok - @emirnoballer \nInstagram - @emirnoballer\n\nBig shoutout to \u200B\u2060@3rdeyeomen596 for tagging along this unique phase of our lives.",
