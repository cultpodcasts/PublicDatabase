      "description": "Adidam is one of the most fascinating religious movements you probably haven\u2019t encountered before. We as people have come so far as to adapt to life alone, but Avatar Adi Da Samraj has provided a given path to your alter ego beyond this life. After visiting one of their few remaining Oasis\u2019, I can wholeheartedly say I\u2019ve succumbed a spiritual experience like never before.\n\n\u2014-\nBE THE FIRST TO SUPPORT THE BRAND\uD83E\uDEF6:\n\nhttps://ikonike1443.com/\n\nBUY ONE GET ONE for a Limited Time \u002B Use code \u201CFirst15\u201D for an EXTRA 15% OFF your ENTIRE order!\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\nInstagram: Emirnoballer\nTiktok: Emirnoballer\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\nFor all inquiries DM on Instagram or dhegrecords@gmal.com",

      "description": "If you\u2019ve kept up with my shenanigans, you may know a few months ago we \u2018joined\u2019 the new Church of Scientology that opened up near us. One of the biggest controversies around Scientology is it\u2019s cult-like tendencies and spying allegations towards former members. The purpose of this yapping recap video is to give a little more insight on my life after the Scientology videos, how we believe that led to us being denied entry into Canada, as well as an insane \u201Ccoincidence..?\u201D with a current member.\n\nFOLLOW MY\nInstagram: Emirnoballer\nTiktok: Emirnoballer\n\nBackground Music Production: @prod.shortbill\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nFor all inquiries:\n\nDhegrecords@gmail.com\nOr IG: @Emirnoballer",

It is not often that we as a society hear many things about this \u0027religion\u0027 unless, perhaps, negative comments in association with a \u0027cult\u0027. I decided to dive head first into the process of \u0027joining\u0027 along with my homie \u200B\u2060\u202A@3rdeyeomen596 \u202C , where we have attempted to journalise footage that not many have successfully obtained. This is based off OUR own experience in our time in the Church of Scientology closest to us. \n\n   This is part 2/2 of the series and if you haven\u0027t checked out part 1, please do so as these took months to make. I look forward to sharing similar sidequest X commentary content with y\u0027all.

There has been VERY FEW instances of people \u2018joining\u2019 this community and being able to release any visuals or info. We decided to journalize OUR own experience with attending these meetings \u0026 events as well as completing and getting an insight on tests, audits, events, purification, and interviews with the Sea Org. Time is money, though Scientology is practically a Religion that lets you level up based on your financial contributions to the church, so here\u2019s an inside view of how much TIME we spent in our City\u2019s brand new Church Of Scientology\u2026\n\n  \u2014\u2014-This is video 1 of 2, so stay tuned\u2014\u2014-\n\nFOR ALL INQUIRIES/SPONSORSHIPS EMAIL\ndhegrecords@gmail.com\n\nMy socials:\nTiktok - @emirnoballer \nInstagram - @emirnoballer\n\nBig shoutout to \u200B\u2060@3rdeyeomen596 for tagging along this unique phase of our lives.",
