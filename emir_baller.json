      "description": "Having been around for decades, what goes on inside Scientology has remained nothing short of a mystery. There has been VERY FEW instances of people \u2018joining\u2019 this community and being able to release any visuals or info. We decided to journalize OUR own experience with attending these meetings \u0026 events as well as completing and getting an insight on tests, audits, events, purification, and interviews with the Sea Org. Time is money, though Scientology is practically a Religion that lets you level up based on your financial contributions to the church, so here\u2019s an inside view of how much TIME we spent in our City\u2019s brand new Church Of Scientology\u2026\n\n  \u2014\u2014-This is video 1 of 2, so stay tuned\u2014\u2014-\n\nFOR ALL INQUIRIES/SPONSORSHIPS EMAIL\ndhegrecords@gmail.com\n\nMy socials:\nTiktok - @emirnoballer \nInstagram - @emirnoballer\n\nBig shoutout to \u200B\u2060@3rdeyeomen596 for tagging along this unique phase of our lives.",
