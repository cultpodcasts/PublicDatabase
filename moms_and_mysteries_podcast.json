      "title": "The Krugersdorp Killings: Cult, Con Artists, and the Woman Who Claimed to Speak for God",
      "description": "In 2016, a string of professionals in the quiet mining town of Krugersdorp, South Africa, started disappearing after appointments with new clients. The killer was a team of believers doing the bidding of a woman who claimed to speak for God herself: Cecilia Steyn.\r\n\r\n Join us as we unpack the chilling details of the Krugersdorp Killings, a case involving a massive financial con and a manipulative cult leader. Join us as we explore how one woman was able to gain control over her followers and convince them to commit a series of shocking murders. Join us as we discuss the terrifying power of this religious manipulation and how the cult\u2019s methods were similar to the dangerous influence wielded by figures like Charles Manson. This is the story of how a twisted belief system led to an entirely preventable tragedy.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n Check-out bonus episodes up on Spotify and Apple podcast now!\r\n\r\n Get new episodes a day early and ad free, plus chat episodes at \u2060Patreon.com/momsandmysteriespodcast\u2060 \r\n\r\n Check-out \u2060Moms and Mysteries\u2060 to find links to our tiktok, youtube, twitter, instagram and more.",
