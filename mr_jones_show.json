      "description": "Part 2 of my story.\n\nAfter leaving the cult, I had nothing. Literally started from zero. No support system. No clue how to \u201Cdo life.\u201D\n\nBut urgency is a hell of a motivator.\n\nI knew I was behind \u2014 so I moved fast.\nI got my third degree. Built two brands. Became an author. Launched a fashion label.\n\nLooking back, I realized I wasn\u2019t just hustling randomly. I was following a pattern. That pattern became my method \u2014 the N.I.C.E.\u2122 framework. It\u2019s how I help others now:\n\n\u2726 N = Narrative \u2014 rewrite your story\n\u2726 I = Insight \u2014 find what you know that others don\u2019t\n\u2726 C = Connection \u2014 build community \u0026 confidence\n\u2726 E = Execution \u2014 move with bold clarity\n\nI\u2019m not sharing this for sympathy. I\u2019m sharing it to prove what\u2019s possible.\n\nIf you\u2019ve lost time\u2026 you can still catch up.\nIf you feel stuck\u2026 you can still move forward.\n\nLet this be the sign you were waiting for.\n\nTimestamp:\n0:00 \u20131:49 How I got in the Cult\n1:49\u20134:10 Experience in the Cult\n4:10\u20135:29 Sense of Urgency\n5:29\u20136:30 Accomplishments after the Cult\n6:30\u20137:43 NICE Strategy\n7:43\u20139:57 Conclusion\n\n\u2705 Subscribe if you\u2019ve ever felt stuck or behind \u2014 you\u2019re not alone.\n\uD83D\uDCA5 Download the FREE \u2018No More Excuses\u2019 workbook \u2192 https://www.mrjones.store/no-more-excuses-guide\n\uD83D\uDCBB Explore all tools \u002B services \u2192 https://mrjones.store\n\u270D\uD83C\uDFFD Tell me if this hit.
