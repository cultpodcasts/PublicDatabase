      "description": "Fear of failure is killing more dreams than failure ever could. 1 in 3 people never even start chasing their dream. Why? Because 49% of us are more afraid of failing than of dying.\n\nBut here\u2019s the truth: Failure isn\u2019t your enemy, it\u2019s the price of success. Thomas Edison failed over 1,000 times before inventing the lightbulb. J.K. Rowling was rejected by 12 publishers before Harry Potter became a global phenomenon. Imagine if they quit?\n\nSo what\u2019s really holding YOU back?\nThis video is your wake-up call to stop letting fear decide your future. If you\u2019re tired of playing small, this will hit you hard\u2014in the best way.\n\nWatch this if:\n- You\u2019re scared of looking stupid or failing.\n- You\u2019re waiting for \u201Cperfect\u201D before you start.\n- You know deep down you\u2019re meant for more. \n\nBe more?
