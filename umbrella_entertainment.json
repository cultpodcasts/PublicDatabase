      "description": "Beyond Our Ken gains access to Australia\u2019s notorious cult Kenja \u2013 a \u2018spiritual awareness centre\u2019 accused of hypnotic mind control, sexual abuse and blamed by families for the disappearance of loved ones.\n\nThrough remarkable observational footage and candid interviews, Beyond Our Ken explores the anatomy and ambiguity of cults.\n\nKenja\u2019s leader Ken Dyers allows himself to be interrogated by the filmmakers in frank and lengthy interviews\u2026until the cracks appear.\n\nDyers is exposed in a dramatic and disturbing finale, ultimately with tragic consequences.\n\nAs Kenja attendees past and present describe their experiences we discover the extent to which environment defines our reality - a reality as fragile as the truth.\n\nA Best Documentary nominee at the Film Critics Circle of Australia Awards and nominated for two Australian Film Institute (AACTA) Awards, Beyond Our Ken was also voted Most Popular Australian Documentary at the Melbourne International Film Festival and selected for the prestigious Toronto HOT DOCS and Sheffield International Documentary Film Festivals.",
