      "title": "The Delphi Murders: Baldwin\u0027s Complaint Part Three: Prosecutor Nicholas McLeland Responds",
      "description": "On February 13, 2017, a man named Richard Allen murdered two girls, 14-year-old Liberty German and 13-year-old Abigail Williams in Delphi, in Carroll County. Carroll County Prosecutor Nicholas McLeland and his team, Stacey Diener and James Luttrull, prosecuted him. Allen\u2019s defense team consisted of lead counsel Brad Rozzi, Jennifer Auger, and Andrew Baldwin. That defense team established a consistent pattern of engaging in baseless personal attacks on prosecutors and detectives throughout their representation, and also put forward a flimsy theory of the case centering an alleged Norse pagan cult. Allen was convicted on November 11, 2024 by a jury of his peers. The Murder Sheet can now exclusively report that Baldwin filed a ridiculous complaint against McLeland this past summer with Indiana\u2019s Disciplinary Commission, a body tasked with disciplinary complaints against lawyers. Baldwin\u0027s complaint was dismissed on its face. Now McLeland will weigh in on the whole situation.
