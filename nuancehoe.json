We\u0027re getting into some deep stuff, from necklace symbols to reintegration and anger roles. Britt shares her unique and brilliant approach compared to the \u0022big 3\u0022 ideologies. Who are the players and what are the tools each one offers as well as their shadow sides? We discuss the balance between ideals of less harm and the realities of everyday life, as well as recommendations for books and podcasts for self-exploration. And what about those spiritual experiences? Britt has some of the wisest words I\u0027ve ever heard. Lastly, cultivating awe in your life! It\u0027s a must!

Let\u0027s discuss. We kick things off with Faith explaining her lifelong curiosity about sex and her journey from fearing it to owning it like an A\u0026#43; boss. Faith drops some wisdom bombs on us about finding a new understanding of morality and making those agreements with ourselves. Plus, we chat about questioning perspectives, stepping out of that comfort zone, and showing yourself some major self-love. Sexuality and self-love connect to literally everything in life, so trust us, you don\u0027t wanna miss a single minute of this epic convo. Desire? Play?

      "description": "Welcome to this soon-to-be legendary episode of The Mormon History Hoedown in which I interview Kwaku El, known for his staunch defense of Mormonism on Ward Radio, Saints Unscripted, and Jubilee\u2019s Mormons vs. Exmormons! In the ring with Kwaku today, we kick it off with his conversion, liberal background, and perspectives as an apologist in the Mormon space. How did he make that shift, what\u0027s his deal and what\u0027s with all these a**holes? Moving on, we\u0027ve got some drama brewing: Ad hominem attacks, DezNat showdowns, and all the tea on what Joseph Smith was really all about. Jumping ahead, let\u0027s get down to basics: What even is Mormonism, and how does Kwaku see it compared to the mainstream? Then, we\u0027re diving into the nitty-gritty: Kwaku\u2019s version of Mormonism versus the beliefs of the masses. We\u0027ve got some spicy topics to stir up: Is masturbation a sin, and are Mormons getting it on before marriage? What is \u0022true,\u0022 and does it even matter? The Book of Mormon \u2013 is it historical, or just a good story? We\u0027re breaking it down. Plus, we\u0027ve got some tight vs. loose translation debates and a chat about anachronisms. Stick around as I engage in a spirited debate with Kwaku, the go-to guy for defending Joseph Smith and nuancing the modern LDS church. \u0026#x1f447; \u0026#x1f447; \u0026#x1f447; I live and die on donor support!

We explore her life in Mormonism in Alabama, Utah and New York City, as well as the dark side of dating her zone leader on her mission and the events that led her out of the church. Cozy up with Carah with Suzy for this special reveal of Suzy\u0027s mission experience. Serving the Lord? And serving the lust. And shame. A place where hopes, consent, and a whole lot of trauma collide. We discuss the pressure to boost baptism numbers, and the surprising events that led to her zone leader asking Suzy to pray to fall in love with him. We hope this story celebrates the power of humanity and community while dishing out some sage advice on spotting red flags, including what Suzy wishes she could tell her younger self.

      "description": "This is part four where Barbara and I discuss the Mountain Meadows Massacre, a tragic event in Mormon history where a group of Mormons in 1857 killed a large group of innocent men, women, and children. We kick things off with a review of the brutal crime of wiping out all the innocent people including young witnesses. As tensions soar, the Mormon leaders are left reeling at the shocking aftermath of their actions. Lies fly and a frantic cover-up ensues, leaving everyone scrambling to keep their secrets buried. The whole situation blows wide open when freighters stumble upon the scene. Amidst the chaos, questions arise about what the orphaned kids might know and how to make them forget. Things take an even more sinister turn when leaders start bragging about their misdeeds in church and resort to making violent threats, then telling prophet Brigham Young a fictionalized version of events.

From 1856 to 1857 in Utah, Mormon prophet Brigham Young played a role in shaping the mindset of the Mormon settlers resulting in a theocracy, heaps of polygamy, and the idea that avenging the blood of prophets was the only rational thing to do. Blood atonement and the Mormon Reformation are key aspects to understanding the religious doctrine and context of the time that shed light on the motivations and justifications used by the perpetrators of the massacre.

Blood atonement and the Mormon Reformation are key aspects to understanding the religious doctrine and context of the time that shed light on the motivations and justifications used by the perpetrators of the massacre.\n\nPick up the book Vengeance Is Mine from your local bookseller or online: https://www.amazon.com/Vengeance-Mine-Mountain-Massacre-Aftermath/dp/0195397851\n\nListen to the audiobook of Vengeance Is Mine: https://www.audible.com/pd/Vengeance-Is-Mine-Audiobook/B0C6FPQFB5?eac_link=QUOOMHSekDaE\u0026ref=web_search_eac_asin_3\u0026eac_selected_type=asin\u0026eac_selected=B0C6FPQFB5\u0026qid=xMIVfP7ajx\u0026eac_id=140-1729692-0760619_xMIVfP7ajx\u0026sr=1-3\n\n\uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47\nI live and die on donor support!

Taking on the Israel-Palestine war one piece at a time with the brilliant Lindsay from @socialistlyawkward1443 by my side to break it all down for this multi-part series of The Mormon History Hoedown. First: We deconstructed Mormonism. Now: We unravel our understanding of holy lands and what pieces of empathy were missing in our previous Mormon minds, including the context and history that\u0027s been hidden. Join us in this eye-opening series where two curious ExMo gals explore the intricate facets of Zionism, delving into its historical, political, and religious implications. Lindsay and I draw on our own journeys of challenging established ideologies, to take you through the intricacies of Zionism, examining its historical roots, and modern interpretations within the context of what has been unfolding with Israel and Palestine for 75 years. With a fresh perspective, shaped by our experiences breaking free from the confines of one structured belief system, we are proud to bring you the Israel-Palestine breakdown of the century atop our know-it-all high horses. (I know that name-calling and so forth happens a lot when discussing this topic so all comments will need to be approved because I\u0027m counteracting the Marxist accusations sure to come my way by keeping my comment section my own private property.)

I explore Tim\u0027s troubling history of lies, laying bare the con-man smoke screen he\u0027s used to shield his actions for far too long. But this video isn\u0027t just about exposing wrongdoing; it\u0027s about giving a voice to the heroic women who have bravely spoken out against these injustices of sexual harassment at O.U.R. Backed by Glenn Beck\u0027s belief in these women\u0027s allegations against his former friend and business partner, The Blaze\u0027s investigative efforts unravel the shocking details of the couple\u0027s ruse, the manipulative tactics, and the devastating impact on the lives of those involved.

      "description": "We dig into the shocking Blaze News \u0022women tell-all\u0022 expos\u00E9 with bombshell revelations on the disturbing behavior of Tim Ballard, the man behind Operation Underground Railroad (O.U.R.). As the story unfolds, we\u0027ll unravel a web of deception, manipulation, and exploitation that will leave you stunned.\n\nI explore Tim\u0027s troubling history of lies, laying bare the con-man smoke screen he\u0027s used to shield his actions for far too long. But this video isn\u0027t just about exposing wrongdoing; it\u0027s about giving a voice to the heroic women who have bravely spoken out against these injustices of sexual harassment at O.U.R. Backed by Glenn Beck\u0027s belief in these women\u0027s allegations against his former friend and business partner, The Blaze\u0027s investigative efforts unravel the shocking details of the couple\u0027s ruse, the manipulative tactics, and the devastating impact on the lives of those involved. This is a story that demands attention, accountability, and support for the victims, and we\u0027ll cover it all right here in this video.\n\nBlaze article: https://www.theblaze.com/news/blaze-news-investigates-what-really-happened-with-tim-ballard-and-operation-underground-railroad\n\nMy latest on all the Tim predictions that ARE COMING TRUE: https://youtube.com/live/iRt-rBvRGw4?feature=share\r\n\r\n\uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47  \r\nHelp me and my team continue making important, hilarious content by becoming a one-time or monthly donor! \r\n\uD83E\uDD1D Donorbox is life: https://donorbox.org/fund-and-keep-nuancehoe-content-alive\r\n\uD83D\uDC69\u200D\uD83D\uDCBB Join the Hoetown community on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/nuancehoe\r\n\uD83C\uDF6F Tip Jar (Venmo: CarahB): https://account.venmo.com/u/CarahB\r\n\r\n\uD83C\uDFA7https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-mormon-history-hoedown/id1706260801\r\n\uD83C\uDFA7https://open.spotify.com/show/5LwwZBSKGDmFdZlOjdZ0dc?si=540081fd437342a2\r\n\uD83D\uDD17 All my links, my merch, and everything fun: https://linktr.ee/nuancehoe \r\n\uD83D\uDCEB Contact Nuancehoe:\r\nthenuancehoe@gmail.com\nTime codes: \n00:00 Glenn Beck and The Blaze expose Tim\u0027s behavior\n5:00 Tim\u0027s past cons show his con-man smoke screen\n6:15 The heroic women speak out\n10:20 Glenn Beck says he believes the women\n13:20 Blaze News investigates \n14:40 The couple\u0027s ruse\n16:10 Tim needed to sexually harass women to pose as a predator\n17:20 The implausibility of the couples ruse\n19:30 Tim abused the couples ruse\n21:30 Forced showers and shared beds\n24:00 Tim\u0027s fake tattoos\n26:35 Traffickers can tell if the couple is real; sex is necessary \n28:15 Tantric massages \u0022shaft of light\u0022\n33:01 Tim made the women have s*x in training\n35:45 OUR didn\u0027t even like the ruse\n37:20 Everyone knows Tim\u0027s a fraud but they want the gravy train\n38:40 The women live in fear\n40:50 Tim was the only operative that \u0022practiced\u0022 s*x in the office/field\n42:45 If you still believe Tim\u0027s couples ruse, seek help\n44:05 Women had to get naked to appear coupled to Tim at all times\n47:50 ALL women to get Brazilian wax\n50:30 The grooming of the women \u0022Is there anything you wouldn\u0027t do to save kids?\u0022\n51:30 Tim bad-mouths women who wouldn\u0027t go all the way\n52:30 Tim couldn\u0027t be questioned\n55:10 Tim\u0027s ego, hates when women think they\u0027re smarter\n57:10 Telling women to keep secret, but use this sexual charge with husbands\n58:35 If they fail at practicing s*x, it\u0027ll waste donor money\n59:30 Women failing at this ruse ruined past missions\n1:02:25 Using Book of Mormon scripture to spiritually manipulate women into s*x\n1:07:10 Bullying women into destroying evidence\n1:09:00 Calculated lies to clear texts, OUR disagrees\n1:12:50 OUR better support these women instead of being cowards\n1:14:18 This is ILLEGAL and called sexual harassment\n1:16:35 Women\u0027s marriages ending, depression, fear, blackmail\n1:18:45 Paranoia of negative attention, political smear\n1:21:37 Women used to put Tim on a pedestal, fear his fan base\n1:22:35 Tim calls these accusations baseless inventions to destroy his work\n1:23:55 Other women come forward to support Tim\n1:26:35 Tim and Katherine go on Adam Corolla to defend shower ruse story\n1:26:57 Tim\u0027s female operative is a Scientologist??\n1:27:50 Katherine Ballard tries to hold Tim\u0027s hand on Adam Corolla\n1:29:00 Tim\u0027s ruse to his wife on turning down women\u0027s sexual advances\n1:31:55 Please give these women who didn\u0027t want this attention your support\n1:34:40 \u0022Tim Ballard has harassed and attacked us\u0022\n1:36:06 Women file lawsuit\n1:37:10 OUR and The Blaze explain their side\n1:38:50 OUR: \u0022Tim\u0027s behavior violated company policy\u0022\n1:41:06 OUR being cowards when it comes to supporting victims of the very thing they\u0027re against\n1:43:20 Closing RANT.

Today I go through some clips of YouTuber and Evangelical to Mormon convert, David Alexander, tell us why Mormon Stories, John Dehlin, and any who leave the Mormon faith are bad, bad Leroy Browns.  \n\nI explain the mind of a Mormon convert. What\u0027s up with them?! Many other religions and spiritual pursuits outside of established religions contain the idea of Christ consciousness. The most successful Mormons to emerge from Mormonism adhere to this idea, yet David\u0027s disdain for anyone leveling up and changing beliefs that separate themselves from the Mormon church doesn\u0027t fill me with confidence that he is on the right path. \n\nFrom the mindset of defenders of the faith, to the valid reasons to leave it, this video touches on all the aspects of a messy faith crisis being able to trust yourself as voices like David\u0027s shout in ignorance about things they simply know nothing about. \n\nClips from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRWezuXPBrk\u0026t=1029s\n\n\uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \nI live and die on donor support!

She argues that both biological sexes were created to help perfect one another through the power of the savior\u0027s atonement. \n\nI delve into the 1995 Women\u0027s Conference, where the LDS church had been filing amicus briefs to stop same-sex marriage in Hawaii. It\u0027s troubling to note that the women in leadership were never consulted on what should go into the proclamation on the family. The women were blindsided by the battle about same-sex marriage and the church\u0027s influence on this matter and we have the interviews to prove it. \n\n\uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \nI live and die on donor support!

Just four short years ago, I was a faithful Mormon girl who covenanted for life to put off all loud laughter and never speak ill of the Lord\u0027s anointed. Likewise, I had two of the funniest and wisest apostates blocked on all the platforms, Tanner and Samantha.  @ZelphOntheShelf  \n\nBut your old girl NuanceHoe can\u0027t snuff down her critical thinking, empathy, and love of the laugh. Not with YouTube algorithms these days. After finally being open to what ExMormon\u0027s gripes with the church were, I clicked on one of Tanner and Samantha\u0027s videos. I\u0027ve been thinking critically, empathic owning, and ironically laughing ever since. My videos aren\u0027t for everybody, and they aren\u0027t supposed to be. (But if you\u0027re the YouTube/Instagram/TikTok algorithm reading that, she\u0027s joking.)\n\n\uD83C\uDF08 Links \uD83D\uDC95\n\u2726 Support this channel on Donor Box to keep the content coming weekly! https://donorbox.org/fund-and-keep-nuancehoe-content-alive\n\n\u2726Support me on Patreon and come be my hoes.

Will it be a toy? Will it be a gift card? *cues Greedy from Ariana Grande* Come get one! I said the word \u0022and\u0022 when referring to the toy and gift card situation, I just get so excited and want to clarify it\u0027s more of an \u0022or\u0022 \u0022one or the other\u0022 situation. But totally amazing and legit and you deserve it after reading this whole paragraph. I love you. \n________________________________________________________________________________________\nIt\u2019s storytime. I barely had the words for this video, but thankfully my bestest bud Samantha of  @ZelphOntheShelf  helped me explain the journey with a lot of laughs and tears. What do you do when you deconstruct your faith and don\u0027t know where to pull strength from? (And there\u0027s literally a tiny human coming out of you....) This is the story of my life in Mormonism, the Christ-centered births that meant so much to me, and where you go when you can\u0027t go back. This is a really special topic to me and I hope it resonates! \n_________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\uD83C\uDF08 Links \uD83D\uDC95\n\u2726 Support this channel on Donor Box to keep the content coming weekly! https://donorbox.org/fund-and-keep-nuancehoe-content-alive\n\n\u2726Support me on Patreon and come be my hoes.

      "description": "Buckle in for a full presentation \u002B clip show and thorough dissection of the most recent talk in the Mormon authoritarian mind virus by Elder Kevin S. Hamilton called \u0022Why a Church?\u0022. The mind-numbing culty-ness is again on display as I highlight all the ways the church set up a system where their members are so desperate for the promised peace and spirituality and salvation, yet are shut down for doubting the leaders, with no way to be in tune with actual peace or spirituality. Why? Because Mormons only think they HAVE IT when they are following the leaders with exactness. What good is your life if you have no grounds to say for yourself \u201CThis is wrong. This doesn\u2019t bring peace.\u201D without the threat of losing your eternal salvation and family? What good is your life if you haven\u2019t learned true morality because your Mormon leaders have made those choices about what\u2019s right and wrong for you? It\u0027s a new style of live-streaming I\u0027m trying to do regularly so enjoy! \n\nOriginal video:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKaPqQDbe9s\u0026t=1409s\r\n\r\n\uD83C\uDF08 Links \uD83D\uDC95\r\n\u2726 Support this channel on Donor Box to keep the content coming weekly! https://donorbox.org/fund-and-keep-nuancehoe-content-alive\r\n\r\n\u2726Support me on Patreon and come be my hoes.
