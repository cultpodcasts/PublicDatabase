In this live steam we ask Barbara the quick facts on the Mountain Meadows Massacre, a tragic event in Mormon history where a group of Mormons in 1857 killed a large group of innocent men, women, and children. With Destiny begging to Manifest in the 1850s, the US government was hot for an economic and cultural superiority expansion. Mormons had their backs! Or DID they? Here\u0027s the overview of all the forces at play that led otherwise sane people (hold your jokes) to commit heinous acts of violence on innocent people.

We\u0027re embarking on a thought-provoking analysis, featuring an exclusive interview with Ryan Fisher, @NephiteExplorer. It\u0027s an honor to have Ryan join us again to provide deeper insights into the complex narrative of Tim Ballard. We are connecting dots and making enemies with doomsdayers and 100 billion dollar corporations. Shocking blessings from Mormon leaders that absolve Tim of guilt is just the start. This is NOT a drill. This is the REAL DEAL. Do these key pieces of intel from Ryan\u0027s decade-long friendship with Tim Ballard combined with the new amendments in the lawsuit and passages from Vision of Glory explain everything? Everyone\u0027s pencils down and eyes forward for the most fascinating deep dive into the mind and making of Tim Ballard. Class starts now!

In part one, we\u0027re diving deep into the mind of Tim Ballard, founder of Operation Underground Railroad, with Ryan Fisher, former confidant of Tim Ballard, esteemed videographer, ex-Heartlander, and journalist. Get ready for an eye-opening multi-series interview with Ryan. From where Tim Ballard\u0027s controversial journey began in the conservative Mormon demographic, and the ethical concerns surrounding his efforts to combat child trafficking. Ryan shares his experience working closely with Tim and launching his American Covenant theories into mainstream Mormonism. In this gripping expos\u00E9, we peel back the layers of Tim Ballard\u0027s enigmatic persona, and unravel the complex web of connections between Tim Ballard, the Mormon Church, M. Russell Ballard, and Joseph Smith. Plus, we\u0027ll delve into the controversial topic of the second anointing in Mormonism and its potential implications for Tim\u0027s trajectory.

Faith drops some wisdom bombs on us about finding a new understanding of morality and making those agreements with ourselves.

In the ring with Kwaku today, we kick it off with his conversion, liberal background, and perspectives as an apologist in the Mormon space. How did he make that shift, what\u0027s his deal and what\u0027s with all these a**holes? Moving on, we\u0027ve got some drama brewing: Ad hominem attacks, DezNat showdowns, and all the tea on what Joseph Smith was really all about. Jumping ahead, let\u0027s get down to basics: What even is Mormonism, and how does Kwaku see it compared to the mainstream? Then, we\u0027re diving into the nitty-gritty: Kwaku\u2019s version of Mormonism versus the beliefs of the masses. We\u0027ve got some spicy topics to stir up: Is masturbation a sin, and are Mormons getting it on before marriage? What is \u0022true,\u0022 and does it even matter? The Book of Mormon \u2013 is it historical, or just a good story? We\u0027re breaking it down. Plus, we\u0027ve got some tight vs. loose translation debates and a chat about anachronisms. Stick around as I engage in a spirited debate with Kwaku, the go-to guy for defending Joseph Smith and nuancing the modern LDS church. \u0026#x1f447; \u0026#x1f447; \u0026#x1f447; I live and die on donor support!

      "description": "In this episode, I interview the wise and delightful Suzy Baker, co-founder of The Psychedelic Assembly. We explore her life in Mormonism in Alabama, Utah and New York City, as well as the dark side of dating her zone leader on her mission and the events that led her out of the church. Cozy up with Carah with Suzy for this special reveal of Suzy\u0027s mission experience. Serving the Lord? And serving the lust. And shame. A place where hopes, consent, and a whole lot of trauma collide. We discuss the pressure to boost baptism numbers, and the surprising events that led to her zone leader asking Suzy to pray to fall in love with him. We hope this story celebrates the power of humanity and community while dishing out some sage advice on spotting red flags, including what Suzy wishes she could tell her younger self.

      "description": "This is part four where Barbara and I discuss the Mountain Meadows Massacre, a tragic event in Mormon history where a group of Mormons in 1857 killed a large group of innocent men, women, and children. We kick things off with a review of the brutal crime of wiping out all the innocent people including young witnesses. As tensions soar, the Mormon leaders are left reeling at the shocking aftermath of their actions. Lies fly and a frantic cover-up ensues, leaving everyone scrambling to keep their secrets buried. The whole situation blows wide open when freighters stumble upon the scene. Amidst the chaos, questions arise about what the orphaned kids might know and how to make them forget. Things take an even more sinister turn when leaders start bragging about their misdeeds in church and resort to making violent threats, then telling prophet Brigham Young a fictionalized version of events.

React with us as we watch Girl Defined\u0027s most uncomfortable, now deleted, highly controversial video where Bethany interviews Christian \u0022sex counselors\u0022 as they detail their path through God-honoring, non-orgasmic, duty-bound sex. In this enlightening video, we take a deep dive into the world of purity culture through the hellscape of Mormonism and Christianity. You\u0027ve heard of Girl Defined reaction videos, but all pale in comparison to the wise, empathetic education Natasha brings to this discussion for those looking to still deconstruct unhelpful Christian sexual dogmas.  \n\nCheck out Natasha\u0027s website and come out to her reclaiming female sexuality event that I\u0027ll be speaking at on April 20th in Ogden, Utah! https://www.natashahelfer.com/retreat\n\n\uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \nI live and die on donor support!

      "description": "Pleasure is the measure, so satisfy your longings to hang out with me for an hour of free education from Natasha Helfer, a certified sex therapist! React with us as we watch Girl Defined\u0027s most uncomfortable, now deleted, highly controversial video where Bethany interviews Christian \u0022sex counselors\u0022 as they detail their path through God-honoring, non-orgasmic, duty-bound sex. In this enlightening video, we take a deep dive into the world of purity culture through the hellscape of Mormonism and Christianity. You\u0027ve heard of Girl Defined reaction videos, but all pale in comparison to the wise, empathetic education Natasha brings to this discussion for those looking to still deconstruct unhelpful Christian sexual dogmas. Check out Natasha\u0027s website and come out to her reclaiming female sexuality event that I\u0027ll be speaking at on April 20th in Ogden, Utah! https://www.natashahelfer.com/retreat \u0026#x1f447; \u0026#x1f447; \u0026#x1f447; I live and die on donor support!

I\u0027m delighted to have Steven Pynakker tell me about his nuanced Christian worldview as I push back with every question I feel is necessary. What a treat. We tackle about the questions around the necessity of Christianity, the bible, and religion as a whole. I think it has something for everyone. Believers, non-believers, and everyone who hated my appearance on Steven\u0027s program \u0022Mormon Book Reviews\u0022. It gets a bit uncomfortable at times, I welcome all pushback, so let me know your thoughts in the comments!

      "description": "Welcome to part 1! Taking on the Israel-Palestine war one piece at a time with the brilliant Lindsay from @socialistlyawkward1443 by my side to break it all down for this multi-part series of The Mormon History Hoedown. First: We deconstructed Mormonism. Now: We unravel our understanding of holy lands and what pieces of empathy were missing in our previous Mormon minds, including the context and history that\u0027s been hidden. Join us in this eye-opening series where two curious ExMo gals explore the intricate facets of Zionism, delving into its historical, political, and religious implications. Lindsay and I draw on our own journeys of challenging established ideologies, to take you through the intricacies of Zionism, examining its historical roots, and modern interpretations within the context of what has been unfolding with Israel and Palestine for 75 years. With a fresh perspective, shaped by our experiences breaking free from the confines of one structured belief system, we are proud to bring you the Israel-Palestine breakdown of the century atop our know-it-all high horses. (I know that name-calling and so forth happens a lot when discussing this topic so all comments will need to be approved because I\u0027m counteracting the Marxist accusations sure to come my way by keeping my comment section my own private property.)

Taking on the Israel-Palestine war one piece at a time with the brilliant Lindsay from @socialistlyawkward1443 by my side to break it all down for this multi-part series of The Mormon History Hoedown. \n\nFirst: We deconstructed Mormonism. Now: We unravel our understanding of holy lands and what pieces of empathy were missing in our previous Mormon minds, including the context and history that\u0027s been hidden. \n\nJoin us in this eye-opening series where two curious ExMo gals explore the intricate facets of Zionism, delving into its historical, political, and religious implications. \n\nLindsay and I draw on our own journeys of challenging established ideologies, to take you through the intricacies of Zionism, examining its historical roots, and modern interpretations within the context of what has been unfolding with Israel and Palestine for 75 years. \n\nWith a fresh perspective, shaped by our experiences breaking free from the confines of one structured belief system, we are proud to bring you the Israel-Palestine breakdown of the century atop our know-it-all high horses.\n\n(I know that name-calling and so forth happens a lot when discussing this topic so all comments will need to be approved because I\u0027m counteracting the Marxist accusations sure to come my way by keeping my comment section *my* own private property.) \n\nSend Lindsay some love on Venmo @socialistlyawkward1443 \nCheck out her links to follow her in all the places: https://linktr.ee/Socialistlyawkward\n\n\uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47  \nI live and die on donor support!

I address the question of \u0022Why Ex-Mormons care about Nelson\u0027s talk,\u0022 delving into the content that raises concerns and his fear-mongering messages. \n\nInsights into topics like the telestial (TK smoothie) body, Joseph Smith, the law of chastity, and the doctrine of tithing. We also dive into the reactions from ExMormon Twitter, DezNat (Pro-LDS) Twitter and explore how this talk may impact mixed-faith families, all while maintaining a thoughtful and critical perspective on the matter.

And why are they looking to leaders like Tim Ballard to take them where they want to go? Ben is a wealth of knowledge on all the ways partisanship has become inseparable from the Mormon church.  Join us as we get into all the ways the church and it\u0027s members pick and choose what brand of God\u0027s one true church they\u0027ll be living today. \n\nCheck out Ben\u0027s article in Slate: https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/09/tim-ballard-sound-of-freedom-abuse-allegations.html\r\n\r\n\uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47  \r\nI live and die on donor support!

Today I go through some clips of YouTuber and Evangelical to Mormon convert, David Alexander, tell us why Mormon Stories, John Dehlin, and any who leave the Mormon faith are bad, bad Leroy Browns.  \n\nI explain the mind of a Mormon convert. What\u0027s up with them?! Many other religions and spiritual pursuits outside of established religions contain the idea of Christ consciousness. The most successful Mormons to emerge from Mormonism adhere to this idea, yet David\u0027s disdain for anyone leveling up and changing beliefs that separate themselves from the Mormon church doesn\u0027t fill me with confidence that he is on the right path. \n\nFrom the mindset of defenders of the faith, to the valid reasons to leave it, this video touches on all the aspects of a messy faith crisis being able to trust yourself as voices like David\u0027s shout in ignorance about things they simply know nothing about. \n\nClips from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRWezuXPBrk\u0026t=1029s\n\n\uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \nI live and die on donor support!

She argues that both biological sexes were created to help perfect one another through the power of the savior\u0027s atonement. \n\nI delve into the 1995 Women\u0027s Conference, where the LDS church had been filing amicus briefs to stop same-sex marriage in Hawaii. It\u0027s troubling to note that the women in leadership were never consulted on what should go into the proclamation on the family. The women were blindsided by the battle about same-sex marriage and the church\u0027s influence on this matter and we have the interviews to prove it. \n\n\uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \uD83D\uDC47 \nI live and die on donor support!

Wanting them to mean the Mormon church was restored by a God who had to utilize the same tactics of other sex cults and tell its leaders to marry other people\u0027s wives and children? You don\u0027t really believe that, right? If so, you\u0027re in good company with me and Bill Reel as we discuss what to do with those Mormon spiritual experiences.\n\nNo stone is left unturned in this video.

For this very special explanation on why I satirize and joke about the Mormon church the way I do, ExMormon hero of mine and cartoon mouse, Tanner Gilliland brings his insights. Just four short years ago, I was a faithful Mormon girl who covenanted for life to put off all loud laughter and never speak ill of the Lord\u0027s anointed. Likewise, I had two of the funniest and wisest apostates blocked on all the platforms, Tanner and Samantha.  @ZelphOntheShelf  \n\nBut your old girl NuanceHoe can\u0027t snuff down her critical thinking, empathy, and love of the laugh. Not with YouTube algorithms these days. After finally being open to what ExMormon\u0027s gripes with the church were, I clicked on one of Tanner and Samantha\u0027s videos. I\u0027ve been thinking critically, empathic owning, and ironically laughing ever since. My videos aren\u0027t for everybody, and they aren\u0027t supposed to be. (But if you\u0027re the YouTube/Instagram/TikTok algorithm reading that, she\u0027s joking.)\n\n\uD83C\uDF08 Links \uD83D\uDC95\n\u2726 Support this channel on Donor Box to keep the content coming weekly! https://donorbox.org/fund-and-keep-nuancehoe-content-alive\n\n\u2726Support me on Patreon and come be my hoes.

Is treasure digging doctrinal orrrrr occultic? \n\n\uD83E\uDEA8 How many times can NuanceHoe make me laugh in 3 hours while providing life changing insights, research, and sources on Mormon history? \n\nYou\u2019ve maybe seen Hannah Stoddard on her latest appearance on Midnight Mormons \u201Cdebunk\u201D this very inconvenient truth. \n\nYou\u2019ve maybe seen her on the back cover of that book your Mormon parents gave you called \u201CFaith Crisis\u201D with the weird, sultry girl on the cover whose eyes follow you wherever you go. \n\nBut if you have ultra right-wing traditionalist Mormon parents and you happen to be an ex-Mormon, you have no doubt seen Hannah haphazardly glued over your face in your family photos. \n\nThis is my life\u2019s work!

So come join the fun as we debunk Gerrit\u0027s innumerable logical fallacies and roast a Mormon historian who thinks we are just some pithy podcasters and TikTokers who couldn\u0027t possibly tell the truth while he uses his position of authority to repeatedly strawman the problems and facts about Joseph Smith and the church.

Hamilton called \u0022Why a Church?\u0022. The mind-numbing culty-ness is again on display as I highlight all the ways the church set up a system where their members are so desperate for the promised peace and spirituality and salvation, yet are shut down for doubting the leaders, with no way to be in tune with actual peace or spirituality. Why? Because Mormons only think they HAVE IT when they are following the leaders with exactness. What good is your life if you have no grounds to say for yourself \u201CThis is wrong. This doesn\u2019t bring peace.\u201D without the threat of losing your eternal salvation and family? What good is your life if you haven\u2019t learned true morality because your Mormon leaders have made those choices about what\u2019s right and wrong for you? It\u0027s a new style of live-streaming I\u0027m trying to do regularly so enjoy! \n\nOriginal video:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKaPqQDbe9s\u0026t=1409s\r\n\r\n\uD83C\uDF08 Links \uD83D\uDC95\r\n\u2726 Support this channel on Donor Box to keep the content coming weekly! https://donorbox.org/fund-and-keep-nuancehoe-content-alive\r\n\r\n\u2726Support me on Patreon and come be my hoes.
