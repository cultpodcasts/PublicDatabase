      "description": "Today, we\u0027re diving into the chilling and complex world of cults with one of the most respected voices in the field: Rick Alan Ross. Rick is the founder and Executive Director of the Cult Education Institute and is widely recognized as a leading authority on destructive cults, high-control groups, and controversial movements. He\u2019s also the author of the acclaimed book Cults Inside Out: How People Get In and Can Get Out.\n\nSince 1982, Rick has been studying and confronting the dangers posed by authoritarian and manipulative groups. His work has led him to testify as an expert witness in courts across the U.S., including in federal cases, and he has advised law enforcement and government agencies on cult-related matters.\n\nIn this episode, we explore it all \u2014 from the infamous Waco siege and the Branch Davidians, to the modern-day manipulation of NXIVM.
