      "title": "Dr Lawrence Patihis on Cult-Like Thinking in Modern Universities",
      "description": "In this in-depth interview, Dr Lawrence Patihis explains how pseudoscientific theories such as repressed memory therapy evolved into wider patterns of social contagion, ideological conformity, and activist scholarship inside universities. Drawing on decades of research in psychology and higher education, the discussion examines cult-like belief systems, the decline of falsifiability, the politicisation of academic life, and why critical thinking, empirical testing, and academic freedom are essential to restoring intellectual integrity in the social sciences. \n---------------\nAPPLY FOR WOKE: THE ORIGINS, DYNAMICS, AND IMPLICATIONS OF AN ELITE IDEOLOGY\nThe only university course exploring and critically assessing the ideology of Woke.\nhttps://www.buckingham.ac.uk/courses/occasional/woke/\n\nSUBSCRIBE\nIf you believe in the mission of the Centre for Heterodox Social Science, please subscribe to our channel by clicking here: https://www.youtube.com/@heterodox_centre?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\nWebsite: https://www.heterodoxcentre.com/\nX: https://x.com/HeterodoxCentre\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/heterodoxcentre/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@heterodoxcentre",
