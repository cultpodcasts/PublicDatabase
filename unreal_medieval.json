      "title": "History\u0027s 7 Most Bizarre Medieval Religious Cults",
      "description": "In medieval Europe, people believed in various extreme spiritual movements, including those who thought they could sin without consequence because they were too holy, and others who believed in a female pope and a demonic black cat. These groups were accused of heresy, including worshiping Lucifer and engaging in orgies and human sacrifice. However, historians are skeptical about the existence of these groups, and many think the accusations were exaggerated or fabricated by the church to justify persecution. The fear of Luciferians was very real, leading to real investigations and punishments, but the stories of these groups are likely based on folklore and propaganda. The medieval worldview was filled with a powerful fear of evil, which was exploited by the church to justify its authority.",

      "title": "6 Medieval Cults Focused on Extreme Asceticism",
      "description": "In medieval times, some people took asceticism to extreme lengths, including whipping themselves in public to appease God and stop the Black Death. The Flagellants, a group of self-flagellants, would whip themselves with leather scourges for 33.5 days, chanting prayers and hymns. Their actions were meant to mimic Christ\u0027s suffering and lift the plague. However, the movement was criticized by the Church and secular authorities, leading to its suppression. The Flagellants\u0027 extreme devotion was a stark example of how fear and religious fervor can combine to produce intense public displays of pain and penance.",
