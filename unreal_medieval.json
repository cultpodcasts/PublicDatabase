      "description": "In medieval times, some people took asceticism to extreme lengths, including whipping themselves in public to appease God and stop the Black Death. The Flagellants, a group of self-flagellants, would whip themselves with leather scourges for 33.5 days, chanting prayers and hymns. Their actions were meant to mimic Christ\u0027s suffering and lift the plague. However, the movement was criticized by the Church and secular authorities, leading to its suppression. The Flagellants\u0027 extreme devotion was a stark example of how fear and religious fervor can combine to produce intense public displays of pain and penance.",
