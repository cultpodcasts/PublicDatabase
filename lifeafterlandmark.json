Next week, Ann will be podcasting with Brian Nord, and other interesting channels are opening up for her too.\n\nWe will very possibly cross paths in this very small circle called Landmark Education, it\u0027s really not as big as many people think... and I think it\u0027s shrinking to unmanageable levels (based on the statistics Riley has been sharing). \n\nIn this, the era of transparency... companies hiding secrets are really struggling, and Landmark is no exception.",

      "description": "what I\u0027m finding with the theme of this channel is that with the (so far) few people willing to speak about their lives AFTER participating in Landmark\u0027s Education, there is a sense of freedom in the room. I know for myself, once Chris Shelton gave me the space to talk, I couldn\u0027t stop.. and it\u0027s a bit like this with these conversations. There is a LOT to talk about, and by the same token there is a lot of information to take in for any listeners who might be researching whether or not to participate in the courses, programs, seminars... or god forbid, \u0022leadership\u0022 programs offered by Landmark Education/Landmark Worldwide.\n\nAccommodating these potential audiences has me take small steps into the lives of people in the room, and so we slowly slowly unravel this highly complex world to have it make sense for ourselves, and whoever tunes in.\n\nThrough these regular conversations with Anne Peterson, the author of \u0022Is This A Cult\u0022, we confront the line between transformation and exploitation. It\u0027s a very fine one.\n\nToday we talk about the exit, why it\u0027s important to know where that door is.. and the stepping stones Anne is building for those who can at least now see the sign.\n\nWe also spell out a few other interesting gems :)\n\nHere\u0027s where you can buy Anne\u0027s book:\nhttps://www.amazon.com.au/This-Cult-Confronting-Transformation-Exploitation/dp/B0CX8XFLWQ",

Ex-Scientologists were speaking a language I understood and I soaked up all the information I could... astounded at the similarities. \n\nThe ontological shift I\u0027ve experienced since that interview is what has me create this channel. The intent is to create a (safe) space for people to speak, to realise they are not going crazy. Those questionable events did happen... and, Landmark is correct, airing what has been suppressed.... saying those things that can\u0027t be said... it really does work. \n\nIf you have something to say about your experience with Landmark, please contact me, let\u0027s talk.",
