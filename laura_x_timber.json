      "description": "EX JW Elder Breaks Silence on Abuse, Shunning \u0026 Cult Tactics\n\nIn this raw and real interview, Jay shares his deeply personal and emotional journey of escaping the high-control world of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. Originally from Mexico, his family immigrated to the U.S. as devoted Catholics but everything changed for Jay\u2019s family when they got that infamous knock at the door. What followed was love bombing, manipulation, and a descent into a world ruled by fear, control, and unquestionable authority.\n\nJay reveals how his mother was swept into the Jehovah\u2019s Witness cult, threatening to leave his father, unless she could raise her children within the religion. His father called it what it was \u2014 a cult \u2014 but resistance only brought more division and he allowed it. At just 12, Jay was baptized into the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, fully immersed in the organization\u0027s grip.\n\nAt 16, he became a ministerial servant (deacon). By 23, he was married and well on his way up the ranks. Eventually, he was appointed an Elder, witnessing firsthand how the Watchtower Society deals with internal abuse, allegations, and predators within the church.\n\n\uD83D\uDED1 What he shares is disturbing \u2014 including how abuse victims are silenced, predators protected, and women marginalized. Jay was told to \u201Cstay in his lane,\u201D never question the Elders above him, and keep things quiet, no matter how serious.\n\nAfter years of spiritual suppression, emotional manipulation, and watching the harm unfold, Jay finally walked away. But leaving the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses came at a massive cost: he lost his marriage, friends, and even family who were still inside. He was shunned, isolated, and left to rebuild from scratch \u2014 like so many Ex JWs who are cast out after choosing truth over fear.\n\n\uD83D\uDCCC If you\u2019re an Ex Jehovah\u2019s Witness, someone currently questioning the organization, or a survivor of religious trauma, this video will resonate deeply. It\u2019s raw, real, and completely unfiltered. Jay\u2019s story shines a light on the emotional abuse, spiritual gaslighting, and toxic culture of silence that thrives inside high-control groups like the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.\n\n\uD83D\uDCAC Comment below if you\u0027ve been through something similar, or are ready to share your own Ex JW testimony.\n\n\uD83D\uDCF2 Don\u2019t forget to subscribe for more raw interviews with Ex Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, former cult members, and people rebuilding their lives after religious trauma.\n\nSupport and Follow Jay\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@UCJSKQTvXgb3WapRaZ6w3DLg \n\nLaura X Timber\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@lauraxtimber\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61566000317102\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@UCPR3FHz8hj9OhI2qR2zxRYw \n\n#ExJehovahsWitness  #ExJW  #JehovahsWitnessCult  #WatchtowerExposed  #CultSurvivor  \n#ReligiousTrauma  #SpiritualAbuse  #LeavingTheWitnesses  #Disfellowshipped  #Shunned",
