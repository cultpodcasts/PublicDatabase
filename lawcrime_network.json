      "description": "\u201CDoomsday cult\u201D mom Lori Vallow Daybell\u2019s niece, Melani Pawlowski, was arrested for alleged criminal trespassing with a domestic violence enhancement in November 2019. One month before that, Pawlowski\u2019s then-husband, Brandon Boudreaux, was shot at outside of his Arizona home. In a recently released indictment against Daybell for conspiracy to commit murder, authorities allege Daybell\u2019s brother, Alex Cox, was the gunman who tried to shoot Boudreaux. The question of whether Pawlowski was involved with her ex-husband\u2019s attempted murder remains unanswered.
