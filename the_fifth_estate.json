      "description": "Hana Gartner investigates the Church of Scientology, which originated in 1954 to follow the teachings of L. Ron Hubbard\u0027s book \u0027Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health\u0027. Scientology aims at \u0027getting clear\u0027 by purging negative experiences from the mind via a process called \u0027auditing\u0027. At issue are its coercive tactics, which make leaving the church difficult and case members to commit uncharacteristic acts like fraud, to demonstrate church loyalty.\n\nOriginal broadcast date: Oct. 8, 1985\n\nSubscribe for more videos from The Fifth Estate: http://bit.ly/25W8cpn\n\nConnect with The Fifth Estate online: \n\nWebsite : http://bit.ly/1d0FBxq\nInstagram : http://bit.ly/25W8SLs\n\nAbout The Fifth Estate: For more than four decades, The Fifth Estate has been Canada\u0027s premier investigative documentary program.
