We think of Jim Jones, David Koresh, James Manson, etc. where people got killed for thinking they were following God through this man.  Well, there are signs of a cult which we\u0027ve gathered in here as well as the definition of a cult.  It\u0027s all very interesting.  After reading through these, we take the time to examine our cult next to the \u0022the list\u0022.  We\u0027re able to give a definitive answer after reading back through the list at the end.
