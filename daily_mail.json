      "description": "The daughter of a Maoist cult leader who kept her as a slave for 30 years revealed today she has forgiven her father despite his psychological and physical bullying.\n \nKaty Morgan-Davies was effectively kept prisoner in the bizarre cult\u0027s house in Herne Hill, South London, and could not get to know her extended family or make friends.\n\nThe 40-year-old was the secret child of leader Aravindan Balakrishnan and one of his followers called Sian Davies, a former pupil at Cheltenham Ladies\u0027 College.\n\nBalakrishnan, who called himself Comrade Bala, was jailed for 23 years in 2016 after the sect was finally exposed and he was convicted of offences including child cruelty, false imprisonment and assault. He died at HMP Dartmoor in April 2022.\n\n#dailymail #mystory #truecrime \n\nDaily Mail Homepage:  https://www.dailymail.co.uk/\n\nDaily Mail Facebook: https://facebook.com/dailymail\nDaily Mail IG: https://instagram.com/dailymail\nDaily Mail Snap: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Daily-Mail/8392137033\nDaily Mail Twitter: https://twitter.com/MailOnline\nDaily Mail Pinterest: https://pinterest.co.uk/dailymail\n\nGet the free Daily Mail mobile app: https://dailymail.co.uk/mobile",
