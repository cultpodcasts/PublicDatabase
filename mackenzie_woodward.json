      "description": "Before I was born, my parents were introduced to the IBLP cult and a Landmark Baptist church. I explain how this happened and give my thoughts on a few things that resulted. I share how my mom was planning my abortion and why. I also process in real-time a detail of a story my mom has told countless times. \n\n\n\n#cultsurvivor #iblp",
