      "description": "The Psychology of Heaven\u0027s Gate and Nan Songer, The Spider Lady What makes a person trade all earthly belongings for a pair of Nikes and a one-way ticket on a UFO behind a comet? In this episode, Jethro dives into the unnerving psychology behind the Heaven\u2019s Gate cult: belief, identity, and how a group of intelligent, seemingly rational people boarded the strangest spaceship never built. Then Kat introduces us to Nan Songer\u2014California\u2019s charming, eccentric \u201CSpider Lady\u201D\u2014who became famous for her eight-legged companions and a personal brand that was equal parts science, spectacle, and complete arachnid chaos.
