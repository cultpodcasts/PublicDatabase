      "description": "I created a video, I want to be able to inform followers of cults that it is not often what it seems; it is easy to get manipulated, isolated by people easily. Cults can be dangerous and lead to individual threats. My audience is young people who are starting to involve themselves with \u0022cult\u0022 looking groups. I want them to be able to see that even a church with a powerful view can have a dark and harmful background.\n\nWork Cited: \n\n \u201CDeath Threats, Broken Families, and Harassment in the Name of the Apostle.\u201D EL PA\u00CDS English, 13 June 2022, english.elpais.com/society/2022-06-13/death-threats-broken-families-and-harassment-in-the-name-of-the-apostle.html.\n\n\nLeader of Religious Organization La Luz Del Mundo, Arrested at LAX on Multiple Human Trafficking and Child Pornography Charges. 24 Jan. 2025, www.ice.gov/news/releases/leader-religious-organization-la-luz-del-mundo-arrested-lax-multiple-human.\n\n\n\u0022The Darkness Within La Luz del Mundo.\u0022 Netflix, directed by Carlos Perez Osorio, 2023.",
