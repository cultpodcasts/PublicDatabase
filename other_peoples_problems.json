      "description": "Brandi (not her real name) has social anxiety because she grew up in a cult where members gathered regularly around her family\u2019s dinner table to talk about mortality and sin. To cope, Brandi hid at the top of the stairs in silence, afraid to even go get a snack. In this session using cannabis, she imagines herself and Hillary bulldozing into the room, taking a stand on the kitchen table together, and demanding freedom. \n\n\nAbout Other People\u0027s Problems: \nReal therapy sessions, recorded. This time, elevated to a whole new level \u2014 literally. Season 5 of Other People\u2019s Problems follows Dr. Hillary McBride and she helps her clients navigate complex trauma using psychedelics.\n\n\n\uD83C\uDFA7 More Other People\u0027s Problems episodes: https://tinyurl.com/4f5383mu\n\u2728 Like this podcast?
