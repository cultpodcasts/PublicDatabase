      "title": "Shunned Cult Survivor Battles With Decision to Tell Dad About Memoir \u0022Out of the Cocoon\u0022",
      "description": "In 2007, I visited the old homestead in Pennsylvania where I grew up.  The farm, built in 1864, belonged to Dad\u2019s family for 147 years.  My great-grandma lived there when she was a child.  I despised that house as a teen.  My childhood haunted me.\n\nI had a secret to tell Dad, something I knew would devastate him and possibly destroy our relationship, but I knew I had to tell him.\n\nA year earlier (2006), my memoir, \u201COut of the Cocoon:  A Young Woman\u2019s Courageous Flight from the Grip of a Religious Cult,\u201D was published.  I wanted him to know how my mother, sister and brother\u2019s decision to shun me since 1980 had impacted my life.  I was terrified of Dad\u2019s reaction.  Would he be forced to shun me too?  I decided to stop running from my past and face it.  \n\nThe topic of \u201Cshunning\u201D was taboo.  Anytime I brought it up, Dad admonished me:  \u201CIt\u2019s in the past, let it go.\u201D For years, I wondered why I couldn\u2019t do that.  Then I came to an epiphany.  I couldn\u2019t let it go because it would impact my life for the next 20, 30, 40 years.   I couldn\u2019t simply pack it into a nice box and stuff it in the past, knowing that every day going forward, I wouldn\u2019t have a relationship with my mom, brother, sister, four nephews or niece.  Shunning wasn\u0027t simply my past; it was my future!  \n\nIn this video diary I share my most intimate concerns, knowing this would be my last visit to the old homestead, a place I grew to love and appreciate as an adult.  In the final moments of this video diary, I ask, \u201CWhat do you say to someone you love when you know you have less than 24 hours left with them?\u201D  \n\nMy dad didn\u2019t shun me after reading my book, but he did throw it away so Mom wouldn\u2019t find it.  He said it would \u201Ckill her.\u201D  I respected his wishes.  This is what I wrote on the inside cover:\n\nDad, \nOur alarm signals ought to go off as soon as someone tells us their way is the only right way....when our contacts and friendships outside the organization are censored...when we consider staying in a group because we cannot bear the loss, disappointment and sorrow our leaving will cause for ourselves and others we have come to love, we are in a cult.\n- Words from Deborah Layton from the book, Seductive Poison (a Jonestown survivor)\n\nSound familiar?  I hope this book will help you understand why I could not live with my eyes wide shut.  All my love, Always, Brenda 2007\n\nThen in 2013 I made a call to Mom, a year after my dad\u2019s death.  You can hear that conversation in this video:  \u201CShould I Study with Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.  They Seem Like Very Nice People.\u201D    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9aNj8bIXDA  \n\nBy then, she had dementia, so I don\u2019t know how much she truly comprehended, but in the video, you\u2019ll hear her hang up on me after denying she ever shunned me.  The truth was just too painful to accept.  \n\nThis religious cult (Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses) run by the Watchtower Bible \u0026 Tract Society has destroyed millions of families.  I call it family genocide.  Buyer beware.  For active JWs, this could be you someday.  I was never disfellowshipped when I left at 18 but I was shunned nonetheless.  My story is not unique.",
