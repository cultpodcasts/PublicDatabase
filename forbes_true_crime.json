      "description": "The Epstein Files Transparency Act, signed into law in November, gave the Department of Justice a deadline of December 19th to release all of their documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Since Friday, the DOJ has released batches of Epstein-related materials on what has been described as a rolling basis. In the document dumps were photos of Epstein with the rich and prominent people, an image of former President Bill Clinton soaking in a hot tub, and an email sent in January of 2020 from a federal prosecutor that claimed \u201CDonald Trump traveled on Epstein\u0027s private jet many more times than previously has been reported.\u201D The DOJ released a statement with the release of the December 23 files that in part said \u201CSome of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election. To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.\u201D Barry Levine, author of \u0022The Spider: Inside the Criminal Web of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell,\u0022 joined \u201CForbes True Crime\u201D to discuss what has been revealed in the released materials so far. \n\nFuel your success with Forbes.

      "description": "Over the summer, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche conducted a two-day interview with longtime Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence after being found guilty of sex trafficking charges in connection to Epstein. During her meeting with Blanche, she claimed to have never witnessed any inappropriate behavior, and that she never saw President Donald Trump engage in any wrongdoing. After the meeting, she was transferred to a minimum-security facility in Texas \u2013 the type of prison camp that typically does not allow sex offenders. Emails that Maxwell has sent since her move to the Lone Star State show she\u2019s received preferential treatment from the warden, benefits from a host of privileges not usually provided to other inmates, and writes in a tone that is \u201Cnotably free of regret, remorse, shame, and self-doubt,\u201D according to The Atlantic staff writer Isaac Stanley-Becker, who obtained the correspondence. Stanley-Becker joins \u201CForbes True Crime\u201D to discuss his takeaways from Maxwell\u2019s emails from prison. Fuel your success with Forbes.
