      "description": "If you grew up in a toxic family and constantly felt unseen, controlled, or punished for being yourself, this video will help you finally understand why.\nA narcissistic family system operates exactly like a cult, with rigid roles, emotional manipulation, and a total focus on protecting the narcissist at all costs. The scapegoat becomes the outsider, truth is distorted, and love is conditional.\nThis isn\u0027t just dysfunction ,  it\u0027s systemic abuse. And recognizing the system for what it is can be the turning point in your healing journey.\n\nStop blaming yourself. It was never your fault.\n\nIt was the system.\n\nAnd now, you can walk away  not in shame, but in freedom.\n\n\n#narcissisticabuse #scapegoatchild #narcissisticfamily #toxicfamily #cptsdrecovery #narcissistparent #emotionalabuse #grayrockmethod #narcissisticmother #familyscapegoat #narcissisticabusesurvivor #nocontact #narcfamilycult #healingfromabuse #boundaries",
