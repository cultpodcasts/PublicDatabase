      "description": "Cult leaders, with their charisma and allure, always wield a captivating influence over the individuals who become their devoted followers. These figures not only have the ability to deliver their ideologies in a way that unfolds gradually and increases with intensity over time but also their ability to fulfill the needs of those who seek purpose, belonging, or a sense of identity. In today\u2019s episode we will take on such a case when discussing the crimes of Jeffrey Lundgren and the event that will become known as the Kirtland cult killings.\u00A0  Patreon.com/truecrimecouple  Sponsors:  Skylight Frames: Get $15 off a Skylight Frame at Skylight Frame.com/COUPLE  Blissy: Get better sleep now with Blissy and use TCC to get an additional 30% off at blissy.com/TCC   Sources: https://archive.org/details/prophetofdeathmo00earl https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-01-13-me-188-story.html https://www.news-herald.com/2014/12/30/kirtland-cult-killings-timeline-of-events/ https://www.news-herald.com/2014/12/30/kirtland-cult-killings-looking-back-at-lake-countys-worst-mass-murder-25-years-later/ https://www.blockparole.com/remembrance/dennis-becky-trina-karen-and-cheryl-avery/ Prophet of Death: The Mormon Blood Atonement Killings by Pete Earley (accessed through Kindle)    ",

But there is always a cult that is kept out of the conversation surrounding the damaging effects and dangers that these deadly cults pose. That would be the Ant Hill Kids. However, the members of this cult would not do harm unto others, harm would be done unto them at the hands of their charismatic leader.\u00A0     patreon.com/truecrimecouple   ",
