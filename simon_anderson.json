      "description": "And I took the opportunity to experiment with video processing. This is the result of almost the best quality I can currently produce for social media platforms. Here\u0027s the method:\n\nRecent Pixel phones have a feature called Video Boost. If you enable it and record in 4K the video processing is performed for you in Google\u0027s cloud, using Google\u0027s AI.\n\nYour phone stores a 1080p preview while you\u0027re waiting for the AI version to process. Apparently the processing time varies but I had to wait TEN HOURS for Google to perform the processing and make this one minute-long clip available. What struck me though is the file sizes:\n\n163 MB - 1080p preview\n2.0 GB - Video Boost file as recorded (4K 10-bit HDR)\n357 MB - Google AI product in 4K\n209.5MB - This video (Google AI version downsampled to 1080p)\n\nThe advantage of this approach is -at least nominally- greater clarity of the final output from an improved source. \n\nThere is one step higher I could go beyond this, by using the AI to upsample the 4K to 8K for processing. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s worth it for a what seems to me marginal quality improvement and the time consumption of processing delays.\n\nSimon\u0027s verdict: great to be improving the technology but at this point in the development cycle it\u0027s more a gimmick than a useful utility.",
