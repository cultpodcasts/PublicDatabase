Often described as \u0022a show about nothing,\u0022 Seinfeld mines the humor in life\u0027s mundane situations like waiting in line, searching for a lost item, or the trials and tribulations of dating. Co-starring are Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Jerry\u0027s ex-girlfriend and current platonic pal, Elaine Benes; Jason Alexander as George Costanza, Jerry\u0027s neurotic hard-luck best friend; and Michael Richards as Jerry\u0027s eccentric neighbor, Kramer.\n\n#Seinfeld #LarryDavid #TheChecks\n\nGeorge Hires A Cult To Clean His Carpets | The Checks | Seinfeld\nhttps://bit.ly/OfficialSeinfeld",
