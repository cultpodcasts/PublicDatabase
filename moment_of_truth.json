Now she exposes the dangers of fast consumerism, GMOs, and a broken healthcare system. Dive into discussions on regenerative farming, the pitfalls of Big Ag, and the cultural shift needed to combat obesity and chronic disease. Jennifer\u2019s insights on Ozempic, food dyes, and the spiritual crisis facing America are both compelling and urgent. Don\u2019t miss this powerful call to reclaim wellness!
