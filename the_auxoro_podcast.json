      "description": "In this segment, author Andrew Lownie explains how recent Jeffrey Epstein files deepen the picture of Prince Andrew\u2019s closeness to Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. While not entirely new, the documents add sordid detail, reinforce victim testimony, and confirm Andrew\u2019s refusal to cooperate with U.S. investigators as a material witness. Lownie argues royal protection stalled justice, but mounting evidence and public pressure make continued silence increasingly untenable.\n\nGuest bio: Andrew Lownie is an award-winning investigative biographer, journalist, and publisher, widely regarded as one of Britain\u2019s most relentless royal historians. He is the author of Traitor King, The Mountbattens, and his latest book Entitled, which examines Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson. Known for deep archival research and award-winning writing, Lownie has built a reputation for exposing power, corruption, and institutional cover-ups at the highest levels of the British establishment.\n\nSubscribe to The Zach Show 2.0 to gain early access to all future episodes, exclusive AMAs, the ability to suggest guest questions, bonus content, and more: https://thezachshow.supercast.com/\n\nANDREW LOWNIE LINKS:\n\nEntitled: https://bit.ly/3YpacFT\nWebsite: https://andrewlownie.me/\nSubstack: https://andrewlownie.substack.com/\nAll Books: https://andrewlownie.me/books\n\nTHE ZACH SHOW LINKS: \n\nThe Zach Show 2.0: https://thezachshow.supercast.com/\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3zaS6sP\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3lTpJdj\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/auxoro/                                \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@zachshowpod                      \nWebsite: https://www.auxoro.com/\n\nIf you\u2019re not ready to subscribe to The Zach Show 2.0, rating the show on Spotify or Apple Podcasts is free and massively helpful.
