      "title": "She Deleted this Video But.... | Tranont Health Claims, MLM Cult Vibes \u0026 Comment Meltdown",
      "description": "It all started in my comment section when Sarah from Tranont came in swinging with classic MLM tactics: insults, toxic positivity, red herrings, and survivor bias. After she called me bitter (multiple times), told me to \u201Cstay irrelevant,\u201D and accused me of eating too much McDonald\u2019s, I decided to click on her profile to see what was up. \n\nAnd surprise! She had multiple videos promoting Tranont with bold health claims, GLP-1 boosting drinks, products that turn carbs into fiber, and a whole lot of pseudoscience sprinkled with spiritual manipulation. So fascinating because all of that goes against Tranont\u0027s own policies. \n\nAfter I called her out publicly for it\u2026 poof. One of those videos magically disappeared. Too bad I already downloaded it. \n\nIn this video, I break down her comment meltdown, expose the manipulation, and react to the deleted video she probably hoped no one saved.\n\nSpoiler: I saved it and many others. This isn\u0027t a new tactic from someone in an MLM.\n\nRemember folks, when they resort to ad hominem\u0027s, they can\u0027t refute the information and facts being shared. \n\n\uD83D\uDD3B WATCH NEXT (The Video She Commented On): https://youtu.be/6MKHpdHgutc?si=AlSZq8DkUvejSZ2p\n\n\uD83D\uDC49 Anti-MLM Playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVAIE_vPKDB-gTYyZPxcd_R_nDoHZfKjd\n\nVideo Editor: @evamateja!
