      "title": "DP/30: My Scientology Movie, Louis Theroux",
      "description": "Louis Theroux is one of the great first-person documentarians, starting his career with Michael Moore (on TV) and becoming a staple on British TV for over 15 years now. His latest is a look at Scientology as only he could deliver it. Fiercely smart and funny, he adds to the current pack of Scientology documentation without treading over anyone else\u0027s perspective. Theroux chatted with David Poland about the film and his career. \n\nShot in Los Angeles, March 2017\n\nSubscribe to DP/30 for more interviews: http://bit.ly/17Xg4Y1",
