She was born and raised [4th generation on both sides] in meetings. She has lived and gone to meetings in 5 counties around the world!  \n\nYou can Contact Genevieve at: genevieve.newell@gmail.com\nYou can contact David/Merissa at: nontypicaltravelers@gmail.com\n\nI David, the interviewer, and Genevieve, grew up in a legalistic group started in 1897 that denies the deity of Christ and strives in vain towards a work based salvation.

However, they stay in members homes known as the Friends.   In \u002723 \u0026 \u002724 a lot of CSA and SA has been revealed in the leadership and members, so many of the Friends are leaving the group.
