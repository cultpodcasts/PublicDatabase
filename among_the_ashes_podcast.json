      "description": "Episode 47\n\nOn tonight\u0027s episode we are hanging out with Stephen Womack. Stephen is a former member of the The Ramp Ministries. He shares about his time as a staff member at the church and the school of ministry, HIs role as a spiritual father to many students and how he was used to \u0022enforce\u0022 the \u0022rules\u0022 of the school of ministry.\n\nHE dives into the tactics used by staff members, to keep students \u0022accountable\u0022 thru fear and is representation of scriptures, as well as being apart of their \u0022SOZO\u0022 meetings ( a form of spiritual therapy) and how staff members would used the things said in these meetings against the students.\n\nHe also speaks of behind the scenes abuse reported by students and community members, and how these allegations would often times be swept under the rug depending on a person\u0027s social status.\n\nHe ultimately came to the decision that The Ramp and it\u0027s leaders were way off base when it came to ministry and the love of Christ and he decided to move on. He along with some other former members of The Ramp are now actively tryin to give hope and a place of refuge to survivors of this \u0022ministry\u0022 and trying to bring awareness to the schemes this \u0022ministry\u0022 plays behind closed doors through their podcast \u0022 God Complex: True Crimes Behind Stained Glass.\n\n***** DISCLAIMER: WE ARE IN NO WAY ACUSING ANYONE OF ANYTHING.

      "description": "Episode: 32 \n\n\n\nOn this weeks episode we are hanging out with Cantley Pittman again and discussing his time being involved with a \u0022ministry\u0022 that was full on taking advantage of him and other members of the team.\n\n\n\nRecently I have ran across several videos on TikTok exposing a ministry close to our home town, with allegations of all kinds of abuse. From sexual allegations to starvation and berating of it college students, church members, the community, the list goes on and on.\n\n\n\nCantley also ran across the videos and reached out to see if I had seen any of them and I told him yes. He then stated due \u0027I was involved\u0022 in this. He stated that watching those videos brought all the emotions he had stuffed for years back to the surface and ultimately belies that this is why he stepped away from his faith.\n\n\n\nMy goal is to always defend the gospel not tear it down. But it\u0027s time we as the body of Christ fight back and expose the grifters \u0026 abusers that take advantage of the body \u0026 bride of Christ, instead of taking a back seat with the comment well \u0022we gotta forgive\u0022 and \u0022I will pray for them\u0022. Yes we do have to forgive, yes we do need to pray for them, but we do not need to let things like this be swept under the rug, especially when so many are coming out with the same stories of abuse. We need to stop defending and start REBUKING these false teacher \u0026 preacher that are getting rich off the back of God\u0027s people. They are modern day Pharisees, which are the same people Jesus to a stand against. Doing nothing makes us guilty and makes Christianity less favorable than it already is.\n\n\n\n***** \u002BDisclaimer\u002B ***** Everything mention here are strictly my opinions from what I have witnessed and Cantley\u0027s first hand account. I have no proof of the allegations on TikTok or any where else in the media, other than Cantley\u0027s testimony. I have know this kid his whole life an have no reason to think he would like. But that being said, allegations are allegations. Innocent until proven guilty. If anyone listening has been apart of church\u0027s or organizations like this and want to share your story or defend the organization we are more than willing to sit down and discuss.
