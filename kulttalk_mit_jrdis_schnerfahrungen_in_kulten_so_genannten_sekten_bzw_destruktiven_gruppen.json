      "description": "- Here the original language Version for the English audience -  \u0022CULTTALK \u0022- The German podcast about experiences in cults or destructive groups. In this podcast episode, we listen to the English-American cult expert Dr. Alexandra Stein. We talk about the core of her work: the connection of cults to the attachment theory. How did she come up with this? What are the connections to disorganized attachment, isolation and dissociation? This also includes our own experiences, such as from her or my cult history. We learn a lot here about the social meaning of \u0022cult enlightenment\u0022; what the whole thing has to do with our society life and destructive political currents like dictatorships. Enjoy listening!  This podcast episode was produced in cooperation with iuvenes e.V. and sponsored by the Renate Rennebach Stiftung. Thank you for making this valuable work possible!  https://iuvenes.eu/  https://renate-rennebach-stiftung.de/ More about Alexandra Stein\u2019s work:  https://www.alexandrastein.com/ Thank you for this wonderful interview!",
