You can overcome insurmountable odds and create a life you love. I did. Just don\u2019t quit.\n\nAs if surviving years of childhood abuse and narrowly escaping a cult and my mother\u2019s insanity wasn\u2019t enough, I ended up married to a physically and emotionally abusive woman with a hidden drug habit. I tried to make it work. I really did. Despite my success in climbing the corporate ladder my questionable instincts caused me to stay in a toxic business environment longer than I should have. Because of my warped sense of what was acceptable, and even desirable, I ignored countless red flags. Many times I wondered, How much more can one person take?\n\nAfter almost dying, I finally realized that the changes I needed to make were so vast and far-reaching that they could only be achieved by exploding the life I had and deliberately creating a new one. For me, it began when I realized that I worked for an organized crime family \u2013 who I suspect was trying to kill me for knowing too much. Does this sound impossible? Well, dear reader, I dare you to open the pages of this book, and be the judge. This is my story \u2013 the one that I wish wasn\u2019t true, but is. Join me on this intense adventure, and here\u2019s a spoiler alert \u2013 I\u2019m not dead.\n\nKENDRA PETTY is a woman who has succeeded in an all-male industry, becoming an Executive Vice President at two firms. Kendra is a dynamic public speaker, powerful negotiator, and dealmaker. She loves bouldering and scrambling in the mountains of California, Nevada, and Arizona. A boater for many years, Kendra also loves fast cars and traveling. I Can\u2019t Believe I\u2019m Not Dead is her debut memoir.",

      "description": "Kendra Petty\u2019s life has been an obstacle course. Her memoir, \u0022I Can\u0027t Believe I\u0027m Not Dead,\u0022 chronicles her fascinating journey through trials, tribulations, and a shocking number of bizarre circumstances - like waking up naked on her neighbor\u2019s balcony in the middle of the night, a bizarre occurrence that she, too, found hard to believe.\n\nBorn and raised in Oklahoma, Kendra was subjected to horrific abuse as a child. Her family, entwined in a self-started cult, held her captive in a toxic environment of manipulation and torment. It wasn\u2019t until she reached adulthood that Kendra was able to break free from the chains of her twisted family life.\n\nDesperate to leave her past behind, she moved across the country to the bustling city of Manhattan. She hoped the vibrant city would offer a fresh start and allow her to blend into the crowds. Despite her high hopes, she discovered that you cannot escape your past simply by changing locations. Trauma, like an ever-present shadow, followed her closely, influencing her choices and leading her into a string of damaging relationships.\n\nKendra also found herself ensnared in a workplace that was as physically lethal as it was emotionally draining. Poisonous in more than a metaphorical sense, her job nearly claimed her life. But even in the face of death, Kendra\u0027s relentless spirit shone through, refusing to succumb to despair.\n\nThe narrative isn\u2019t all doom and gloom, however. Amidst the tragedies and hardships, Kendra maintains her humor, recounting the absurdities of her life with a levity that offers an antidote to the heavier elements of her tale. She portrays her world in vibrant detail, weaving together the comical and tragic with a narrative flair that keeps readers both engrossed and entertained. \n\nMost importantly, Kendra\u0027s story is a testament to resilience. She has faced down the past that pursued her, battled against adversity, and slowly but surely, has shifted from mere survival to thriving. Today, Kendra Petty stands as a beacon of hope and strength, a shining example of the incredible power of human resilience.\n\nIn \u0022I Can\u0027t Believe I\u0027m Not Dead,\u0022 Kendra invites us into her world, encouraging us to laugh, to cry, and to marvel at the extraordinary saga of her life. Through her experiences, she demonstrates the power of tenacity and humor in overcoming even the most formidable challenges. Her journey is a testament to the indomitable spirit within us all and a reminder that no matter the depth of our struggles, there is always a chance for redemption and growth.\n\nTo download a free sample of her book or purchase an autographed copy visit https://kendrapettyofficial.com/.\n\nFor more about O\u0027Leary Publishing and to start your publishing adventure visit https://olearypublishing.com/.",
