      "description": "Join Kristen and Laura at the crack of dawn as they dive into the chilling documentary \u0027Daughters of the Cult\u0027. This episode explores the sinister life of Ervil LeBaron, the self-proclaimed prophet and leader of a fundamentalist Mormon cult. Ervil\u0027s journey from jealousy and manipulation to orchestrating murders within his own family highlights the depths of his delusions and control. Discover how his teachings, rooted in the macabre doctrine of blood atonement, led to a series of gruesome events, including the murder of his own brother and influential figures like Rulan Allred. This is part one of a two-part series that intertwines with the complex history of the LeBaron family and its connections to modern polygamist communities, including \u0027Sister Wives\u0027. Stay tuned for part two to uncover more about the distressing experiences of Ervil\u0027s children and their quest for redemption.\n\n00:00 Welcome and Early Morning Banter\n00:57 Movie Talk and Caffeine Preferences\n03:38 Introduction to Daughters of the Cult\n04:18 Ervil LeBaron and His Notorious Legacy\n09:09 The LeBaron Family Dynamics\n14:15 Ervil\u0027s Rivalry with Joel\n17:30 Ervil\u0027s New Sect and Dark Preachings\n19:09 Unveiling the Cult\u0027s Dark Secrets\n19:44 Ervil\u0027s Manipulative Tactics\n21:25 The Isolated Community\n22:24 Ervil\u0027s Family Dynamics\n27:00 The Murder of Joel\n31:08 The Plot Against Rulan\n38:07 The Aftermath and Conclusion\n\nFor more bonus episodes, hot takes, \u0026 trash, join us over on our Patreon: patreon.com/The_Reality_Rewind_Podcast \n\nJoin our Facebook group Reality Rewind Podcast here: https://www.facebook.com/share/g/1YoKF8tiET/?mibextid=K35XfP\n\nFollow Reality Rewind Podcast on Instagram @realityrewindpod!\n\nEmail us at realityrewindpodcast3@gmail.com!",
