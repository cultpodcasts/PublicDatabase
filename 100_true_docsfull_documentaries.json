      "description": "\u0022THE WACO SIEGE\u0022 / Spring 1993, the small town of Waco, Texas, is in the news: a religious group, the Branch Davidians, have been holed up in a ranch for weeks. The American police are convinced that the group is a cult led by David Koresh, a man with an outstanding arrest warrant. Worse still, the cult is said to possess over 150 weapons and 200,000 rounds of ammunition. Despite repeated negotiations, Koresh refused to surrender, and the \u0022Davidians\u0022 remained entrenched in their residence. The authorities feared mass suicide, but they also knew that any intervention could result in a bloodbath. How did negotiations proceed during the 51-day siege? What really happened within the sect and among the authorities?\n\n#documentary #society #international\n\nA documentary by Fran\u00E7ois TRIBOLET\nFirst broadcast : 2019\n\n\uD83C\uDF0D Subscribe to 100% True Docs\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCScqEUopEq3fq-JgZAAITsQ/?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\uD83C\uDF0D Produced by CAPA Presse",
