What was presented as a place of help, healing, and \u201Crestoration\u201D became a system rooted in control, fear, and spiritual manipulation.\n\nTogether, Nyssa and Rachel speak honestly about life inside the ranch, the tactics used to enforce obedience, and the lasting impact that environment had on their sense of identity, safety, and faith. They unpack how religion was weaponized, how silence was expected, and how questioning authority came with consequences.\n\nThis conversation is not about attacking faith \u2014 it\u2019s about exposing abuse disguised as righteousness and giving voice to those who were never protected. Nyssa and Rachel\u2019s courage in telling their stories is a reminder that survival itself is an act of resistance, and healing begins when truth is spoken out loud.",
