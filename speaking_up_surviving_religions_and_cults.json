Over time, many from their generation decided to leave, but their family, with the exception of their mother, remained entrenched in the cult. The PCG functioned as a doomsday cult, fixated on the imminent return of Christ, using fear as a tool to enforce compliance and belief in their fabricated beliefs.Become a Patreon member HERE and access all bonus episodes \u002B other benefits. https://www.patreon.com/4ndrewpledgerConnect with Andrew Pledger through social media, and his website. https://andrewpledger.mypixieset.com/links Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "Kristina Mand-Lakhiani is an international speaker, entrepreneur, artist, philanthropist, and mother of 2 kids. As a co-founder of\u00A0Mindvalley, a leading publisher in the personal growth industry, Kristina dedicated the last 20 years of her career from teachers like Michael Beckwith, Bob Proctor, Lisa Nichols, and many more.\u00A0She started her career in a government office in her native Estonia and, by her mid-20s, achieved a level of success mostly known to male politicians at the end of their careers. It was shortly after that Kristina and her then-husband Vishen founded Mindvalley. From a small meditation business operating out of the couple\u2019s apartment in New York, the company quickly grew into a global educational organization offering top training for peak human performance to hundreds of thousands of students all around the world.\u00A0Kristina believes life is too important to be taken seriously and makes sure to bring fun into every one of her roles: as a teacher, mother, entrepreneur, philanthropist, and world traveller.

I dig into the psychology of mankind\u0027s search for truth, and how cults prey on this drive. Join me as I draw from the wisdom of ancient thinkers and modern philosophers to navigate the various theories of truth. Together, we will examine the notions of correspondence, coherence, and pragmatism, seeking to grasp the essence of what it truly means for a statement or belief to be considered true. We\u0027ll ponder the timeless questions: Can truth be objective, or is it a subjective construct? Does absolute truth exist, or is truth merely a product of our interpretations?Join Andrew\u0027s Patreon HERE and access all bonus episodes \u002B other benefits. https://www.patreon.com/4ndrewpledgerConnect with Andrew Pledger through social media, and his website. https://andrewpledger.mypixieset.com/links Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "Deborah Grace\u00A0spent the better part of her life writing for the legitimacy of the scriptures, but it was in those writings that the truth began to surface. Having been told numerous times over the years that she would one day write a book, Crucifying the Bible is her first published book and the last point of contention she ever imagined taking on. Although controversial, Grace found the process to be cathartic and another layer of closure to her past journey in faith; healing many old wounds inflicted by religion and finding a sense of validation as she connected with others who shared similar stories in her research. Deborah is currently writing her second book.As an INTJ, she is careful with her choices, detailed in her work, introspective in her personal growth, and strives to finish strong. Her tagline is to be a better person today than yesterday and an even better person tomorrow than today.Deborah with her husband Mark and Yorkie Tank in Georgia. In her spare time, and in addition to writing, she enjoys learning new things,\u00A0traveling with her husband, and a good glass of Italian wine.\u00A0Buy Crucifying the BibleConnect with Deborah GraceWebsite, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTubeSupport Andrew\u0027s work on Patreon HERE and access all bonus episodes \u002B other benefits. https://www.patreon.com/4ndrewpledgerConnect with Andrew Pledger through social media, and his website.

      "description": "Singer-Songwriter Nicole Zell has finally found her voice on debut album, Asleep To My Own Magic, undoubtedly her most mature, enlightened work yet. After achieving minor success throughout her twenties such as touring nationally with American Wolves, fronting THRILLCHASER, co-billing with acts such as KT Tunstall and Vanessa Carlton, and being featured on numerous press outlets such as Billboard, Fuse TV, and TODAY with Hoda and Jenna, Nicole took a step back to \u0022evaluate my position around the age of 27\u0022 as she sings in \u00227 Years\u0022 - a song penned as an apology for not believing in her younger self. For an artist who was timid to release solo music for years, Nicole holds nothing back on this album. In songs like \u0022Cycle\u0022, Zell dares to confront generational cycles, childhood abuse, her religious upbringing, and even god himself. As the story reaches an end, it becomes apparent that Zell has tapped into the ability to turn darkness into light, struggle into success, trauma into triumph, and mayhem into magic. In \u0022Magic\u0022, the closing song on the album, Nicole can be heard joyfully singing a healing affirmation alongside a celestial choir, \u0022I am safe, I am loved, I am healing, I am light . . . because I am the magic.\u0022Listen to Nicole Zell\u0027s Music on Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, or BandCampFollow Nicole on Instagram, and check out her LinktreeConnect with Andrew PledgerLinktreeSupport on PatreonInstagramTikTokTwitterYouTubeWebsite Hosted on Acast.

The purpose of my life is to bring coherence to the inner and outer lives of all beings, so that they may know themselves as the source of their consciousness. Blaise\u0027s work is the result of his personal transformation, which began in 2010 when he checked into a drug rehabilitation centre. At 24 years old, and after many years of avoidance, struggle, and difficulty, Blaise was finally ready to face reality. After 5 months of treatment Blaise saw tremendous benefits in every area of his life and experience. He left the treatment centre with one question. \u201CHow far and how deep can I take this?\u201D How much transformation is possible? Every moment since then has been the fulfillment, the living answer to his question. Today Blaise shares the most valuable and essential elements of awakening and healing, so that you too may know how far and how deep your life can go.Connect with Blaise KennedyYouTubeLinktree Connect with Andrew PledgerLinktreeSupport on PatreonInstagramTikTokTwitterYouTubeWebsite\u00A0 Hosted on Acast.

She\u0027s the author of Intersexion: a Story of Faith, Identity, and Authenticity from Lake Drive BooksBook Description: \u0022Sometimes in life we reach an intersection where we must pick either safety or stepping into life as our true selves. It\u2019s a moment of courage, vision, and finding our voice.Cynthia, an adjunct professor with a trunk full of ungraded papers and snack wrappers, has been an LGBTQIA\u002B ally for years\u2014in convenient ways. She enjoys the company of her queer friends\u2014but her support isn\u2019t risky; it hasn\u2019t cost her anything. Until she meets Danny. The youngest child in a conservative religious family, Danny played the role of dutiful daughter\u2014Dani, with an \u201Ci\u201D\u2014which was safer than jeopardizing faith and family. Seemingly born female, yet desperate to be seen as the boy and then man he is, Danny kept playing along, until his life and health depended on one thing: the truth.Told in both Danny\u2019s and Cynthia\u2019s voices,\u00A0Intersexion\u00A0is a moving, hopeful exploration of the cost of being known\u2014as an intersex minority, ally, or asker of difficult questions\u2014and what it means to come into one\u2019s own. It\u2019s a book for anyone craving a more authentic life. It\u2019s a story about the intersections we find ourselves in by no choice of our own, and the life-giving choices we can make.Named on the Top 34 LGTBQ Christian Books of 2022 by Q Spirit\u0022Connect with Cynthia Vacca DavisBookLinktreeInstagramConnect with Andrew PledgerLinktreeSupport on PatreonInstagramTikTokTwitterYouTubeWebsite\u00A0 Hosted on Acast.

She homeschooled her children, wore a head covering, and was very conservative. Her marriage was difficult and got harder as the years went on. Eventually, they had a series of tragedies strike that she could not explain if there was indeed a loving or omniscient God. This plunged her into a time of existential crisis. She divorced her husband and religion, went back to school to become a registered professional counselor, and connected with Dr. Marlene Winell who coined the term Religious Trauma (Dr. Winell is now her friend and mentor).
