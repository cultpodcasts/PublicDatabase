      "description": "This program is part of our Good Lit series, underwritten by the Bernard Osher Foundation.\n\nJackie Speier was 28 when she joined congressman Leo Ryan\u2019s delegation to rescue defectors from cult leader Jim Jones\u2019 Peoples Temple in Jonestown, Guyana. Ryan was killed on the airstrip tarmac, and Speier was shot five times at point-blank range. While recovering from what would become one of the most harrowing tragedies in recent history, Speier had to choose: Would she become a victim or a fighter? The choice to survive against unfathomable odds empowered her with a resolve to become a vocal proponent for human rights.\n\nFrom the formative nightmare that radically molded her perspective and instincts to the devastating personal and professional challenges that would follow, her memoir, Undaunted, reveals the perseverance of a determined force in American politics. Deeply rooted in Speier\u2019s experiences as a widow, a mother, a congresswoman and a fighter, hers is a story of true resilience, one that will inspire other women to draw strength from adversity in order to do what is right\u2014no matter the challenges ahead.",
