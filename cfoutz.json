      "description": "I Found the Internet\u2019s Strangest Alien Rabbit Hole\nI thought I was just watching some fake UFO videos. Instead, I ended up in one of the weirdest corners of the internet that i didn\u0027t even know existed, people who believe they\u2019re literal aliens, TikTok psychics scamming their viewers live, and a guy who thinks he\u2019s channeling an interdimensional alien being named Bashar.\n\nThis is a commentary-style deep dive into internet cults, fringe beliefs, and rabbit holes that probably shouldn\u0027t exist - but somehow do. It\u2019s the kind of video you\u2019d expect to find next to Kurtis Conner or Oompaville. If you\u2019ve ever gone too deep on Reddit, or watched a TikTok that made you question reality, this one\u2019s for you.\n\nTikTok conspiracy, reaction commentary, iceberg style topics, weird side of YouTube, internet rabbit holes, Remote viewing, internet mysteries.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u27A4Join the Community:\nhttps://discord.gg/YOURDISCORD\n\n\u27A4Support Me on Ko-fi (if you like what I do):\nCreating videos like this takes time, so If you want to help me achieve my dream and keep making more.
