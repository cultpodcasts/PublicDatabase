Is it love and unity or division and family destruction? \nThese videos are part of the Cult Escape awareness campaign and so far this has been the most watched video.\nHow long has you family been cut off from you via cult law?\n\nFor all Cult Escape videos see the playlist at: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1a1AufRcbOMlK07wAFluSg/videos \n\nThese videos are part of the Cult Escape campaign and are for the purpose of shining a light on the lifestyle I and many cult members are bought up in.

      "title": "Ending Cult Control - The Amazing Conclusion | Chapter 25 | Cult Escape | Narrated by John Spinks",
      "description": "What could be the most effective solution to the religious cult abuse that is ravaging the lives of millions of people all around the world today.\n\nBy abuse, and there are many forms, I only refer to one; Family Destruction.\nThis is where a religious cult wields power to indoctrinate, control and influence their members to cut of any family member who does not agree and obey their Leaders\u0027 laws / rules.\n\nThis cutting off / shunning / ostracising, leaves in their wake, their legacy of destroyed familes. Families are split, often for life, causing untold anguish, heartbreak, destruction and loss.\n\nAlmost surprisingly, the cult members don\u0027t see the anguish, heartbreak and loss. This is because their cloak of self-righteousness is masking even their natural affections. Their hearts are rendered stone cold, lacking empathy. The lens they have been indocrinated to wear only sees one thing. \u0022We are the \u0027right\u0027 religious group, all others are wrong.\u0022\n\nWhat can be done? Is there a \u0027solution?\u0027 Is there any hope for the future?\n\nYes there is. Here is the Conclusion. I invite you to sit back and open your heart to unconditional love. Give yourself the opportunity to consider the outrageous possibility that we are all Love Creatures, our minds have just be blinded to seeing it. We have forgotten who we are, what our true identity is and where we came from.\n\nI offer this Conclusion to you, not to try to make you believe it one jot or tittle, but rather to consider it. To consider what Unconditional Love might begin to look like if it spread like tongues of fire and lit up the souls of everyone.\n\nMy love to you.\nJohn\n\nFor all Cult Escape videos see the playlist at: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1a1AufRcbOMlK07wAFluSg/videos \n\nThese videos are part of the Cult Escape campaign and are for the purpose of shining a light on the lifestyle I and many cult members are bought up in.

The main reason being, that it would give governments too much power, and where would it stop, and also, it would contravene people\u0027s freedom of religion and freedom of worship.\n\nThis I agree with, they shouldn\u2019t be banned. \n\nHowever, there is a clear disctinction between Freedom of Religion and being free to destroy families, which this proposal seeks to address.\n\nThis video is a part narration of the book Cult Escape Chapter 24 called Legislation Proposal. you can read it in full on the cult Escape campaign website at: https://cult-escape.com/religious-transparency/\n\nFor all Cult Escape videos see the playlist at: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1a1AufRcbOMlK07wAFluSg/videos \n\nThese videos are part of the Cult Escape campaign and are for the purpose of shining a light on the lifestyle I and many cult members are bought up in.

      "description": "The Wild Years were the two years after I had escaped from the Exclusive Brethren. I had been restricted and restrained like a coiled spring for the 22 years since birth and once I found my freedom, I wasted no time in exploring the so-called \u0027wicked\u0027 things of this world.\n\nFor all Cult Escape videos see: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1a1AufRcbOMlK07wAFluSg/videos\n\nOf course, most of what I explored and enjoyed was not \u0027wicked\u0027 at all, it was all normal healthy stuff like enjoying music, eating in restaurants and making friends with many good people that I met.\n\nHowever, I was vulnerable and very naive and soon got myself into a few tricky situations to say the least, many stories of which i narrate in this Chapter in the 3 parts.\n\nI didn\u0027t write this chapter to entertain or to glorify any of my actions but rather to show to anyone watching, who might be in the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, the Mormons, the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church aka Exclusive Brethen, and any of the 1000s of  cults in this world, that there is a life outside of your controlled environment that is full of life, love and laughter and you don\u0027t have to live your life under the grip of other men\u0027s bigoted laws if you don\u0027t want to. \n\nMaybe you can learn from a few of my mistakes even and survive and thrive better than I did too. Best wishes to you.\n\n(Here\u0027s the link to the previous Chapter: https://youtu.be/AbbDJ2dP17g )\n\n\n\nThese videos are for the purpose of shining a light on the lifestyle I and many cult members are bought up in. All cults have differing laws over their followers but they all amount to one thing; Control. \n\nThis Cult Escape campaign that is shining light on what goes on in cults is not a revengeful attack on any of them. It is just stating facts and experiences that I went through which the Exclusive Brethren to this day still believe are God\u0027s instructions and laws. \n\nIt is for the purpose of helping those who see themselves trapped under such laws to give them a reality check on how they are being controlled so that they can choose for themselves if that is the life they want. \n\nIt is to help those who have been wounded and damaged by their cultic experiences to give them hope for healing and encouragement in going forward, after their families have been separated and destroyed by the cultic laws. \n\nIt is to warn people what could also happen to them should they join a religious group that has laws that will mean family separation if the rest of their family are not members. \n\nAnd it is to spread unconditional love around this world and to show that though we don\u0027t have to live under the rule of man\u0027s religious cultic laws, we can still love them all. \n\nThe Cult Escape website is at www.cult-escape.com \n\nI narrate the book Cult Escape here on YouTube, one chapter per week so no need to buy the book. \n\nIf you wanted to though, you can access the eBook free on Amazon Unlimited, or purchase the paperback or eBook here: \n\nFor UK : https://amzn.to/2YlRakl \nFor US : https://amzn.to/3cPOXD8 \nFor Canada : https://amzn.to/2Ykw85L \nFor Australia : https://amzn.to/2zq6Bj8 \n\n*************************************************************** \nFor the Cult Escape website resource see: http://www.cult-escape.com *************************************************************** \nThank you for watching this video!

      "title": "The 2nd Biggest Reason People Are Trapped In Cults | I\u0027m Trapped If I Leave, I\u0027ll Lose My Family!",
      "description": "Who gets into this terrible situation, whereby they can say, I\u0027m trapped, if I leave, I\u0027ll lose my family. Maybe you are in the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, PBCC, Exclusive Brethren, Mormons, Church of Scientology, World Wide Church of God, Seventh Day Adventists or any cultic group that has rules that separate and destroy families.\n\nUnfortunately many thousands of religious cult members across the world are in this predicament. I was, and I went through the awful wrestling in my mind for 4 years before I came to a place of peace and singlemindedness.\n\nThis video addresses the 2nd biggest reason that traps people in cults; The fear of losing their loved ones.\n\nHere are the 2 further videos links on this subject that are mentioned:\n1: How To Escape From A Religious Cult\nhttps://youtu.be/5LW3vVCXvQw\n2: Why Are cults So Difficult to Escape From?\nhttps://youtu.be/Jn6nRIXp4gM\n\nAnd here are the 3 scenarios mentioned in the video, why you might want to stay in the cult:\n\nThere are many reasons why people want to remain, even after discovering their group is cultic. For some, totally understandably, leaving and losing their family who might stay, is not an option. The goal of what I\u2019m suggesting to you, is that you come to a place of peace and single-mindedness about where you are, at least for now, even if you find you have to take one day at a time.\nI know what it is like to want to remain in a group, even though part of me wanted to leave. My struggle with making up my mind lasted four years. It took me that long to come to terms with the thought of possibly not seeing my family ever again.\nHere\u2019s a question to ask yourself. What comes first? Family, or freedom from the cult? Every situation and circumstance is different, so there is no one single answer for all. But if you were to remain in the cult option, there are 3 possible variations to consider:\nA: Stay, and with your family aim to gradually sow seeds in discussion and research with them, that might eventually, with patience, make your family realise that it is a cult that you all, don\u2019t want to be part of. I know someone who did just this. His wife and three children were committed to the cult, but after 18 months of research and really examining where they were, deeply looking into the issues of the self-righteousness, changing laws, hypocrisy, bigotry, control, fear, exclusivity etc, the whole family came to a place of agreement and they all happily left together.\nA 2nd possibility: Stay with your family and have faith in God to guide you within the cult. Do you believe in a God that can guide you? If so, this is an option for you. If not, then it\u2019s not an option.\nThe 3rd possibility: Stay with your family, put up and shut up. This is a real and realistic option that most take. There are certain things in life that we sometimes can\u2019t cope with. Consider this; not all have the strength to leave a place that is all they have ever known. Leaving can be very daunting and can cause fear to even think about it. There was a time when for me, thinking of leaving my parents was traumatic and unthinkable. Is there a place for accepting this and seeing ourselves kindly? We all have strengths and weaknesses and by accepting this and not being hard on ourselves, we can still live our life knowing we are doing our best, with the strength we have at this time. Being ruthlessly honest with ourselves is always the best way forward and even if you live with a conflict of values and live your life under the control of the cult, at least you can live your life knowing you are doing your best, with the strength you have found in yourself so far. Give yourself a break. You can always change your mind in the future.\nIf after weighing up these options you choose to remain, at least for now, all respect to your decision and best wishes on the rest of your journey.\n\n\u0022A person will leave a cult when their value to escape, is stronger than the value to stay.\u0022\n\nRead the full story how John Spinks endured his 22 year challenge, the history, the childhood, the separate lifestyle, the laws, rules and fear of the consequences of disobeying the \u0027Man of God,\u0027 his eventual escape and much more, read the whole story in the book Cult Escape:\n\nAvailable on Amazon now:\nFor UK : https://amzn.to/2YlRakl\nFor US : https://amzn.to/3cPOXD8\nFor Canada : https://amzn.to/2Ykw85L\nFor Australia : https://amzn.to/2zq6Bj8  \n\n***************************************************************\nFor the Cult Escape website resource see:\nhttp://www.cult-escape.com\n***************************************************************\nThank you for watching this video!

      "description": "Can I Have My Dad Back Please: A Letter To The PBCC ( Plymouth Brethren Christian Church ) Leader is what I should have written and delivered years ago, that is, express my true, honest, raw and real feelings, but I wasn\u0027t ready, till now.\n\nThis video letter is dedicated to families all over the world that have been divided and destroyed by religious cults. \n\nI want to encourage anyone, whose family has been destroyed by such a religious group, if they feel ready,  to write to the leader or leaders of the group they were in and express how they feel in whatever way they choose. \n\nThe more light that shines, the greater the displacement of darkness.\n\nHere\u0027s the short version of the background behind this video letter. \nI, John Spinks, was born into the Exclusive Brethren, in Liverpool, England, a Protestant sect that started around 1830. As the years went by, successive leaders took the group into extreme exclusivity and severe judgement against anyone who did not conform to their leader\u0027s laws. \n\nBy the time I was born it was a high demand controlling group with the laws more extreme than ever. In 1970, when I was 4, a huge split happened and my 4 grandparents left. We were coerced into cutting them out of our life completely and I never saw them again.\n\nWhen I was 22, I escaped the control and my family was coerced into having nothing to do with me. It was heartbreaking. That was 32 years ago and the only reason my family has been divided and destroyed over these last 50 years now, is because of the laws the leader imposes on them all. \n\nThey rebranded in about 2012 changing their name to the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. \n\nThe current leader, Bruce D Hales from Sydney decides the current laws and in this video, I\u0027m expressing how my family destruction has felt over all these years, and I\u0027m asking him to consider replacing his ever changing laws with unconditional love. When this happens, and it is inevitable that it will do, I\u0027ll get my Dad back.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about this story of religious control and family destruction, you can read all about it in John\u0027s book called Cult Escape. Read how he endured his 22 year challenge in the Exclusive Brethren; the history, the childhood, the separate lifestyle, the laws, rules and fear of the consequences of disobeying the \u0027Man of God,\u0027 his eventual escape and much more.
