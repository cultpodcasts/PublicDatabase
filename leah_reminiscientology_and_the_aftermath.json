      "description": "Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath concluded with a two-hour series finale special on August 26, 2019. In the finale, which was filmed for the first time in front of a live studio audience, Remini and Mike Rinder explored stories of how Church of Scientology policies have hindered members from reporting instances of abuse and sexual assault to the authorities. They spoke to ex-Scientologists who shared their stories of abuse at the hands of other Scientologists, and described how the policies are aimed at preventing the alleged crimes from becoming public. A panel of legal, psychological and law-enforcement experts also provided insight into the impact Scientology\u2019s practices have had on its former parishioners and advised how they can seek justice and effect change in the future",
