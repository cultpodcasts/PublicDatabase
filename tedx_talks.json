      "description": "Do you know someone who has changed radically in their values and beliefs? Do you think it may have been brainwashing? Steven Hassan offers a 4-step reality testing formula developed over 45 years of research starting after leaving a cult that deceptively recruited him. The bottom line is that brainwashing is not just something that happens in cults\u2014we are all susceptible. A talk to make you think.\n\nEmpowerment, Freedom, Global issues, Law, Psychology, Social Justice, cults Steven Hassan, PhD is a mental health professional and expert in undue influence tactics used by authoritarian leaders and destructive cults. His expertise includes harmful influence in cases of destructive religious and political cults, human trafficking, extremist and terrorist groups, one-on-one relationships, families, parental alienation, mini-cults, therapy and self-improvement groups, professional and institutional abuse, corporate and multi-level marketing programs, and harmful belief systems. He is the author of four books including Combating Cult Mind Control, Freedom of Mind and The Cult of Trump. He is a translated author with books in 10 languages.

He also is the founder of Freedom From Undue Influence, a not-for-profit entity with the purpose of conducting and publishing the research on undue influence that is needed to update legal and social policies. He developed the BITE Model of Authoritarian Control to identify control tactics and the Influence Continuum Model to discern ethical from unethical influence. He developed the Strategic Interactive Approach (SIA), as an effective and legal intervention alternative for families to help cult members. Dr. Hassan believes that access to the truth, freedom of thought, and freedom from undue influence are basic human rights. A complex systems approach, based in science and supported by the rule of law, is necessary to protect these rights. He is a member of the Program in Psychiatry and the Law at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center, a teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School. He is an experienced educator having served as an instructor for the Harvard Law School Trial Advocacy Workshop, as an elective teacher and a presenter for the Harvard Longwood Psychiatry Residency Training Program, and in other educational and training capacities for other higher education, professional, law enforcement, governmental, non-governmental and advocacy group audiences. Dr. Hassan began helping people affected by undue influence after he was deprogrammed from the Moon cult in 1976 at age 22. His 45 plus years of experience give him a unique perspective on the damaging effects of undue influence and exploitation by destructive cults. He is a frequently requested speaker and media interviewee. Dr. Hassan holds a Master\u2019s Degree in Counseling Psychology from Cambridge College and a Doctorate in Organizational Development and Change from Fielding Graduate University School of Leadership Studies.

      "description": "How often do we, as women, not speak up when someone is violating our personal space, in particular when a man is touching us and it is unwanted? Our experiences of violation can be horrific or seemingly insignificant which, in reality, seems to have little correlation to whether the psychological effects are severe or mild. Yet, all of our experiences share a common message about the nature of what it is to be a woman. At its core, it is about property rights \u2013 Do I own me? Do I have a full and unfettered property right to my own body? What does that actually look like? Faith Jones is an international corporate attorney and executive coach who capitalized on her unusual background to create her unique \u201CI Own Me\u201D framework which works to empower women in business and personal relationships. Her passion and focus is to inspire women to take back responsibility for their own lives, decisions, businesses, and bodies through education and by changing the societal systems and laws that have prejudiced them for centuries. Faith, who graduated summa cum laude from Georgetown\u2019s School of Foreign Service and with honors from UC Berkeley Law School, was named the Top 40 Under 40 M\u0026A Advisor in 2015.

In China, she came to question these beliefs and left the religion. Shunned by family and friends as an apostate, Scorah was alone in Shanghai and thrown into a world she had only known from the periphery, with no education or support system. After growing up in the Jehovah\u0027s Witness faith, Amber learned Mandarin Chinese and moved to Mainland China to become an underground missionary. In China, encountering a new culture and making friends outside the faith for the first time, Amber came to question the beliefs she had been taught from childhood and ended up leaving the religion.  \nAmber later moved to New York City, where she began a new life. Several years later, her three-month old son died on his first day in childcare. After this tragedy, Amber became a parental leave advocate. Combining forces with a Republican mother, their bipartisan efforts brought the cause of parental leave to the forefront of the 2016 presidential campaign. She was named one of the 100 most influential people in Brooklyn culture by Brooklyn Magazine. \n\nHer writing has appeared in The New York Times, The Believer, The Boston Globe, The Cut, The Globe and Mail and USA Today.

      "description": "At 14-years-old, Christian Picciolini went from naive teenager to white supremacist, and soon, the leader of America\u2019s first neo-Nazi skinhead gang. How was he radicalized, and how did he ultimately get out? In this courageous talk, Christian shares a surprising and counterintuitive solution to hate in all forms. After leaving the white-supremacist skinhead movement that he helped build in the 1980s and 90s, Christian Picciolini co-founded Life After Hate, a nonprofit dedicated to helping people disengage from violent extremism. His memoir, White American Youth: My Descent into America\u0027s Most Violent Hate Movement\u2014and How I Got Out (Hachette), which details his involvement, and eventual disengagement, from the early American white nationalist movement, will be published on December 26, 2017.
