      "title": "The Common Ground of Cults and Conspiracy Movements | Jonathan McDonald | TEDxIPS Wroclaw Youth",
      "description": "In this thought-provoking talk, Jonathan explores the psychological and social mechanisms that drive individuals toward radical belief systems and tightly bonded ideological groups. Drawing from his background in anthropology, psychology, and global studies, he analyzes what unites seemingly different movements - from cults and extremist militias to radical ideologies and conspiracy circles. By examining how identity, fear, belonging, and cognitive bias play a role in group formation, Jonathan reveals the patterns behind polarization and radicalization. His talk challenges us to look beyond labels and understand the human needs that often fuel dangerous ideologies. Jonathan is a psychology and geography teacher with an academic background in anthropology, originally from the United States. His interdisciplinary interests lie at the intersection of human behavior, societal structures, and global affairs. He is particularly focused on the psychology behind prejudice, the formation of social groups, and the political dynamics shaping the modern world. Jonathan brings both academic insight and real-world perspective to his work, aiming to deepen understanding of how people think, connect, and divide.

      "description": "From a naive teenager seeking self-improvement to becoming entangled in the dark underbelly of the personal development industry, Rose\u0027s story shatters our assumptions about who falls prey to cultish influence. \n\nIdentity can connect us, but it can also control us. \nRose challenges us to look closer at the groups and ideologies we hold sacred. \n\nHer talk is a wake-up call for anyone who\u0027s ever thought \u0027that could never happen to me\u0027.

      "description": "Cults: Insidious groups which prey on the weak, destroying lives in the process. We all know that cults are bad, but do we even know what they are? Lewis shows that cults have been around for as long as humans have decided to live together. Cults, through their darkness, reveal dark truths about the human condition as-a-whole. The only way to fight them is to learn about and confront ourselves, and that\u2019s something everyone, not just people in cults, needs to deal with.  Lewis is a student who is deeply interested in what makes people \u2018tick\u2019. From examples of human interaction in Literature to the Science of human bonding, his enthusiasm in understanding the ways people engage with each other ranges the whole academic gamut. The sensitive and powerful place that religious belief has for many people has variously eluded, confused, and captivated him throughout his entire student life.

      "description": "Do you know someone who has changed radically in their values and beliefs? Do you think it may have been brainwashing? Steven Hassan offers a 4-step reality testing formula developed over 45 years of research starting after leaving a cult that deceptively recruited him. The bottom line is that brainwashing is not just something that happens in cults\u2014we are all susceptible. A talk to make you think.\n\nEmpowerment, Freedom, Global issues, Law, Psychology, Social Justice, cults Steven Hassan, PhD is a mental health professional and expert in undue influence tactics used by authoritarian leaders and destructive cults. His expertise includes harmful influence in cases of destructive religious and political cults, human trafficking, extremist and terrorist groups, one-on-one relationships, families, parental alienation, mini-cults, therapy and self-improvement groups, professional and institutional abuse, corporate and multi-level marketing programs, and harmful belief systems. He is the author of four books including Combating Cult Mind Control, Freedom of Mind and The Cult of Trump. He is a translated author with books in 10 languages. His foundational online course is Understanding Cults: The Basics. He is the Founding Director of the Freedom of Mind Resource Center, which provides training, consulting and support to individuals who are struggling to leave or recover from a cult and to families and organizations that are concerned about cult behaviors. He also is the founder of Freedom From Undue Influence, a not-for-profit entity with the purpose of conducting and publishing the research on undue influence that is needed to update legal and social policies. He developed the BITE Model of Authoritarian Control to identify control tactics and the Influence Continuum Model to discern ethical from unethical influence. He developed the Strategic Interactive Approach (SIA), as an effective and legal intervention alternative for families to help cult members. Dr. Hassan believes that access to the truth, freedom of thought, and freedom from undue influence are basic human rights. A complex systems approach, based in science and supported by the rule of law, is necessary to protect these rights. He is a member of the Program in Psychiatry and the Law at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center, a teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School. He is an experienced educator having served as an instructor for the Harvard Law School Trial Advocacy Workshop, as an elective teacher and a presenter for the Harvard Longwood Psychiatry Residency Training Program, and in other educational and training capacities for other higher education, professional, law enforcement, governmental, non-governmental and advocacy group audiences. Dr. Hassan began helping people affected by undue influence after he was deprogrammed from the Moon cult in 1976 at age 22. His 45 plus years of experience give him a unique perspective on the damaging effects of undue influence and exploitation by destructive cults. He is a frequently requested speaker and media interviewee. Dr. Hassan holds a Master\u2019s Degree in Counseling Psychology from Cambridge College and a Doctorate in Organizational Development and Change from Fielding Graduate University School of Leadership Studies.

      "description": "How often do we, as women, not speak up when someone is violating our personal space, in particular when a man is touching us and it is unwanted? Our experiences of violation can be horrific or seemingly insignificant which, in reality, seems to have little correlation to whether the psychological effects are severe or mild. Yet, all of our experiences share a common message about the nature of what it is to be a woman. At its core, it is about property rights \u2013 Do I own me? Do I have a full and unfettered property right to my own body? What does that actually look like? Faith Jones is an international corporate attorney and executive coach who capitalized on her unusual background to create her unique \u201CI Own Me\u201D framework which works to empower women in business and personal relationships. Her passion and focus is to inspire women to take back responsibility for their own lives, decisions, businesses, and bodies through education and by changing the societal systems and laws that have prejudiced them for centuries. Faith, who graduated summa cum laude from Georgetown\u2019s School of Foreign Service and with honors from UC Berkeley Law School, was named the Top 40 Under 40 M\u0026A Advisor in 2015.

      "description": "Amber Scorah is author of the memoir Leaving the Witness. Growing up in the Jehovah\u0027s Witness faith, Scorah moved to mainland China to become an underground missionary. In China, she came to question these beliefs and left the religion. Shunned by family and friends as an apostate, Scorah was alone in Shanghai and thrown into a world she had only known from the periphery, with no education or support system. After growing up in the Jehovah\u0027s Witness faith, Amber learned Mandarin Chinese and moved to Mainland China to become an underground missionary. In China, encountering a new culture and making friends outside the faith for the first time, Amber came to question the beliefs she had been taught from childhood and ended up leaving the religion.  \nAmber later moved to New York City, where she began a new life. Several years later, her three-month old son died on his first day in childcare. After this tragedy, Amber became a parental leave advocate. Combining forces with a Republican mother, their bipartisan efforts brought the cause of parental leave to the forefront of the 2016 presidential campaign. She was named one of the 100 most influential people in Brooklyn culture by Brooklyn Magazine. \n\nHer writing has appeared in The New York Times, The Believer, The Boston Globe, The Cut, The Globe and Mail and USA Today.

      "description": "Claire Ashman was born, raised, and birthed 9 children in a cult. She shares how the prevalence of cults and cult-like thinking affects everyday people. In Australia there are over 3000 cults, with some 600,000 members, meaning we all know, or have had contact with at least one person who is a member of a cult. Cults and secretive groups fill certain voids that all people feel at some point in their lives. Everyone has had a time in their lives when they\u0027ve felt vulnerable or directionless. For some people, it\u0027s easier to have someone give you the answer than living through the pain. \n\nAshman shares awakening for cult-member\u2019s friends, colleagues and family members to recognize the signs and be present to support upon exiting a cult.

      "title": "From Endurance to Empathy: Lessons I learned from leaving a cult | Cherish Weiler | TEDxTUJ",
      "description": "Born into a religious cult, Cherish Weiler spent her life watching her parents leave behind the world they knew and start a new life in the United States. She learned powerful lessons of endurance from the ex-member community, lessons that pushed her to earn two engineering degrees as a first generation university student. Yet, she faced her own set of challenges; while she was too young to be accepted as an ex-member, her upbringing markedly set her apart from her peers. In this talk, she aims to share her experiences growing up and how building empathy empowered her to overcome her failures.\n\nBorn into a religious cult, Cherish Weiler spent her life watching her parents leave behind the world they knew and start a new life in the United States.
