And I learned a few things:  1) American culture celebrates individualism and personal freedom more than anywhere else, 2) the isolated rural areas across the U.S. provide the perfect environment for secluded, self-sustaining communities to thrive and 3) the conservative communities in the USA are the strictest on earth. \n\nI hope you enjoy this long documentary about America\u0027s strangest cults and communities.

      "title": "Entering America\u0027s Most Conservative Amish Cult",
      "description": "In this eye-opening story, I explore the lives of the Swartzentruber Amish - the most conservative subgroup of Old Order Amish. They arguably lead the most conservative and traditional lives of any humans on our planet. I gotta say, even after visiting all 197 countries in the world, I found the Swartzentruber Amish to be among the most fascinating groups of people I\u0027ve come in contact with.  And it\u0027s in my own country!\n\nThrough my friend Lizzie, a former Swartzentruber Amish who grew up in Holmes County, Ohio, I gained rare access to this secluded community that is off-limits to outsiders.  Join me as we learn first-hand from the Swartzentruber Amish, as well as get a deep dive into Lizzie\u0027s childhood as she remembers it. \n\nNowadays, Lizzie is an incredible entrepreneur and runs her own business in the health \u0026 wellness industry. You can follow her journey on the links below:\n- IG: https://www.instagram.com/lizzieens_wellness\n- YT:@lizzieenswellness\n- Get her newly launched book! https://amzn.to/3LfyxaP\n\nHere\u0027s a little more information on the Swartzentruber Amish:  They are renowned for their extreme adherence to tradition and rejection of modern conveniences. They maintain the strictest rules regarding technology, shunning electricity, indoor plumbing, and even bicycles. Their church services are marathon-like, often lasting up to six hours, emphasizing their deep spiritual devotion to God.\n\nWhat makes the Swartzentruber Amish even more fascinating and shocking is their commitment to living without modern healthcare, relying solely on traditional remedies and community support. They also practice rigorous schooling and they complete education at the 8th grade, focusing instead on practical skills and Amish traditions.  \n\nI\u0027d love to hear from you guys! Let me know your thoughts on this story in the comments down below - do you agree or disagree with the Swartzentruber Amish way of life?\n\n#usa #travel #ohio \n\n\u2705  Don\u0027t forget to SUBSCRIBE to my channel by clicking here \u279E   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Ize0RLIbGdH5x4wI45G-A\n\n\u25B6\uFE0F Watch my favorite videos \u279E https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhiP3P44ul3Y8LDbhXJmhVsVWcpe-7O4O\n\nFIND ME ON:\n\u25BA INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\u25BA TIK TOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n\u25BA FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n\u25BA YOUTUBE 2ND CHANNEL: https://rb.gy/a65sj\n\n\uD83D\uDC68\uD83C\uDFFB\u200D\uD83E\uDDB0 WHO AM I? \nI\u0027m Drew Binsky and I have been to EVERY country in the world (197/197).
