      "description": "cw: discussion of attitudes around death, mention of violence in scripture I\u2019m shining a light on how missionaries are prepped with coercive strategies and trained to manipulate! Today we\u2019re learning about one of the goals from the 12-Week Training Program, \u201CI am comfortable with silence as I teach.\u201D I\u2019ll give a glimpse into what this meant for me as a missionary, how I trained other missionaries on the topic, and how silence is actually in real life a very powerful thing that can be used to manipulate you. In week thirty-six, my journal entries include playing frisbee golf in my first-ever District P-day group activity, attending (virtually) the funeral service for esteemed Apostle Elder L. Tom Perry, and resolving to put my Mission President\u2019s Wife\u2019s phone number on speed dial when I got home.

This week I\u2019m focusing in on the theme of sacrificing yourself to receive the blessings of heaven, except it turns out that sacrificing and suffering can be really bad for people. I turn to the research behind Adverse Childhood Experiences, or ACEs, as a basic argument against the idea of suffering as a net positive. And in fact, it turns out that groups asking you to sacrifice is a known element of control in cults. An article by our friend Steven Hassan explains the concept of cognitive dissonance, handily connecting the Mormon Church\u2019s obsession with sacrifice to another method of coercive control. In week thirty-five, my journal entries include luxuriating in the freedom we got from having 30 whole minutes on a P-day to wander around a parking lot and have FUN, cheerleading my new greenie through her first day of working through a fast, managing my disappointment when a Memorial Day trench-digging service project was cancelled, and unironically writing, \u201CI\u2019m pretty excited to be a wife \u0026 Mom. : )\u201D Support me monthly on patreon:D patreon.com/AllyChristiansen Make a one-time donation on Ko-fi: https://ko-fi.com/allychristiansen This project is very rewarding and very time consuming.

Unfortunately, the Mormon theological world has almost no female representation. I\u2019ll discuss how this environment of male-centric authority figures and spiritual philosophies lead to my increased self abandonment, as I tamped down every part of myself that didn\u0027t fit perfectly into the Church\u2019s mould for women.

      "description": "CW: discussion of over-eating This episode unpacks my third week as a Sister Missionary. I start by sharing the mythology around and assignment of mission areas, and then we dive into my journal entries from that week. This week\u0027s journal entries include going to my first area and meeting my trainer, the attempted transplant of Utah Mormon culture into rural North Dakota, and my first experience of being over-fed for brownie points.

I give context for my time in the MTC (Missionary Training Center), then share my journal entries from that week. Covered topics include important family events that missionaries miss, the unspoken social beliefs around why a missionary would go home early, \u0026 the absolute naive audacity Mormon missionaries have regarding the trauma dumping that happens to people seen as authority figures.
