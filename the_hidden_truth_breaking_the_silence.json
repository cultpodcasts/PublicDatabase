      "description": "I was challenged about my statements regarding the court case involving Jerome Frandle (and the ensuing overseers\u0027 lack of response).  \n\nFor the sake of the bigger picture, it\u0027s important that I conduct myself with integrity and keep my word that I would issue a correction if I misspoke. \n\nI\u0027ve read the 65 page court transcript.  While I strongly dislike how his lawyer handled this, and how Jerome made no effort to correct his lawyer on his legal arguments,  I also want to make sure that I can firmly back up what I say, and in the case of Jerome Frandle, I can\u0027t unequivocally do so.\n\nWhat has been established is that when it is convenient, overseers are free to act with authority over their \u0022clergy\u0022.\n\nAnd when it is inconvenient (such as in court proceedings), to deny the authority exists.\u00A0\n\nIf anything, the transcript highlights the level of uncomfortable secrecy that exists within this ministry and organization.  \n\nNonetheless, I trimmed out a 20s segment that involved statements about Jerome Frandle\u0027s court case.",

He expresses his frustration at the lack of individual conversations within his family and wonders if predators know how to pick their victims. Dale shares about the long-lasting impact of abuse.

      "description": "On this episode of \u0022The Hidden Truth, Breaking the Silence,\u0022 our guest today is Cherie Kropp, author of \u0022Preserving the Truth,\u0022 who shares her personal journey within the fellowship and her extensive research on the subject. Cherie, a third-generation member, grew up on convention grounds in Mississippi, providing her with a unique perspective on the inner workings of the fellowship. Leaving home, Cherie got married and lived in Dallas for a while. As she did not have a university education, questions started to form in her mind regarding the strict rules enforced within the fellowship. These questions, along with a desire for personal freedom, eventually led her to leave the fellowship. Cherie explains that she began questioning the teachings of the church and sought scriptural support, but could not find any. She recalls asking a worker about the biblical basis for there being only one way to heaven, but the worker was unable to provide any scripture to support the claim. This realization made her question the true nature of the church. Cherie\u0027s research on the fellowship led her to start a website called tellingthetruth.info, where she collected documents and photos related to the fellowship. Eventually, she decided to turn her research into a book, spending 30 years on her research, including trips to the UK to gather more documents. Cherie sent an exit letter to many friends and family during her journey and received few responses, feeling somewhat shunned. During the conversation, Cherie and the host discuss their ongoing research into the origins and growth of the fellowship. They touch upon interesting documents and court cases related to allegations of human trafficking and child sexual abuse within the fellowship. Cherie\u0027s passion for preserving historical information drives her to continue her work, as she believes that everyone associated with the church has the right to know the truth and make informed decisions about their involvement.\u00A0 I encourage our listeners to read Cherie\u0027s book, \u0022Preserving the Truth,\u0022 for a deeper understanding of the fellowship. Until next time, thank you for joining us on \u0022The Hidden Truth, Breaking the Silence.\u0022",

      "description": "In this episode of The Hidden Truth, we dive deep into the Christian fellowship that has maintained a painful silence for years. Lauren Rohs joins us as our guest, sharing her experiences growing up in the fellowship and shedding light on its strict beliefs and lack of meaningful friendships. We explore the evolution of the fellowship from her great-grandparents\u0027 era to the present day, and Lauren takes us on her personal journey of questioning and eventually leaving the community. We delve into the unsettling aspects of control and the fear of asking questions that pervade the community. Lauren also shares her passion for playing the piano and her admiration for Rachmaninoff. Moving beyond her life within the fellowship, Lauren discusses her experiences as a stripper and the difficult decision to give her child up for adoption. We explore her attempts to reconcile with her family and the shocking revelations she uncovered about her father\u0027s abusive behavior. Throughout the conversation, I stress the importance of storytelling and the urgent need for radical change and reparations within the community. We discuss the fear and avoidance that prevent people from facing the truth and the devastating consequences of maintaining the status quo, particularly in cases of child sex abuse. As the main speakers, we emphasize the significance of breaking the silence and exposing the harmful behavior that persists within the fellowship. We liken the secrecy to a form of \u0022child sacrifice,\u0022 as it allows the abuse to continue unchecked. We express our outrage at those who dismiss these crimes due to their occurrence in the past, highlighting the ignorance and disrespect towards survivors. Drawing parallels to commemoration events like 9/11, we stress that the ongoing impact of these crimes necessitates support for survivors and a refusal to uphold appearances. Quoting Jesus\u0027 teachings on the consequences of harming children, we condemn those who enable and cover up the abuse in the fellowship. We discuss the trauma triangle and the critical step of removing oneself from enabling abusive behavior. We highlight the magnitude of the problem, likening it to the reputation of the Catholic Church for enabling and covering up abuse. We encourage listeners feeling overwhelmed to recognize their role and take action, promoting awareness and change. Expressing the need to stop being complicit and withdraw support from the system that enables child sex abuse, we acknowledge that making a change will take time but is absolutely possible. We express perplexity over the failure of educated individuals to recognize child sex abuse as a crime, perhaps due to flawed theology or doctrine that prioritizes personal salvation over speaking up against the institution. As the main speakers, we point out the dangerous dynamics of a system where overseers are complicit with perpetrators. We reflect on our decision to write a letter to the overseers, knowing it wouldn\u0027t result in their stepping down but hoping to set a precedent for speaking out against those in power. We acknowledge that while some people may still idolize these individuals, survivors\u0027 stories and the accompanying data should be enough to wake people up. Despite the recognition that survivors shouldn\u0027t have to repeatedly share their stories to be taken seriously, we discuss the importance of their narratives in leaving a lasting impact on listeners. We express a willingness to watch the organization implode if it means justice for survivors. As an outsider looking in, we share the mixed response we\u0027ve received, ranging from praise to vilification, but state that we\u0027ve become immune to both. We express frustration at encountering individuals who should know better, such as a lawyer who wants survivors to come to him for information despite being close friends with a perpetrator. We emphasize the need for policy changes in light of the crisis, underscoring the lack of protection for children within the community. Expressing concern for educated individuals who refuse to acknowledge the need for systemic change, I share my personal frustration, particularly within my own family who dismiss my efforts and label me as crazy. I stress that those who speak out against abuse are not the ones condemned to hell; rather, it is the actions of the child predators themselves. I call on others to focus their anger on the perpetrators and take action by not supporting them financially or granting them authority. As the main speaker, I urge fence sitters to reckon with the issue and take an active role in the fight against abuse. I emphasize that survivors are not obligated to share their stories, placing the responsibility on the complicit community to take action and disrupt the status quo. In conclusion, we express our gratitude to Lauren for sharing her time and her important work. We stress that the focus should be on the thousands of survivors who need support and justice. As a community, we owe them our love, support, and assistance. Thank you for tuning in to The Hidden Truth, and please remember to subscribe and share to help us reach and inspire more people. It is crucial that these stories are heard to raise awareness and support the survival of victims.",
