      "description": "During a deposition, Les Wexner was questioned about Epstein survivor Maria Farmer, who is not present in court. Farmer alleges she was assaulted by Jeffrey Epstein near Wexner\u2019s property in 1996.

Court records reveal the stark contrast between the survivor\u2019s allegations and Wexner\u2019s blunt denials, raising new questions about his ties to Epstein and the management of his estate.\n#US #epstein #leswexner #apt \n\n\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpLEtz3H0jSfEneSdf1YKnw/join",
