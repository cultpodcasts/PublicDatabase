If you are listening to this episode, I imagine you are not there currently. That is okay! No rush or no race to your healing. \n\nIt is time for an Exmormonology Pep talk and a story of a extremely nervous Amy at her first time ever exmormon meet up AND a woman in red boots. \n\nI would love to be your life coach and help you navigate this road you find yourself on.

After decades of needing to measure up, to be worthy enough, to go the LDS temple and progress through all the proper ranks of mormonism, it is no wonder so many mormons and exmormons a like, never feel worthy enough. \n\nDo not underestimate how harmful \u0022worthiness interviews\u0022 are within the mormon church.

May seem simple at first, but to really digest these concepts and apply them to your life takes practice.\n\nAs humans, most of us have not be taught how to manage our minds and emotions. To really look at the thoughts you think as little sentences that run through our brains, feels strange at first, they just see true. Especially  if you have been thinking one way your whole life, it feels uncomfortable to change that one way. However, once you can observe your thoughts and see how they create the feelings you feel in your body, you can begin to be more intentional with your thoughts and feelings. This is the part that is life changing in all the best ways.\n\nI always recommend that you start from the point of awareness of the thoughts you think, the stories you have on repeat. If you feel first and think second, start there, with what you are feeling. For example, if you feel a lot of anxiety and you are fully aware of that, can you connect it back to what you are thinking? Once you do that, you will be able to see the thoughts that you want to change and in doing so you will have less anxiety. \n\nThink about it. A belief is a thought we have had on repeat for years and years. If you think, for example, \u0022I am stupid\u0022 or \u0022I am not enough,\u0022 etc. you will feel a certain way when you think this about yourself. This is why it is important to look at your though(s) as little sentence that run across your mind, instead of those thoughts being true. Just because you think a certain way about yourself, does not make it true. This is where you have wiggle room to change core beliefs you have about yourself.\n\nThis process takes time. If you have been thinking certain thoughts about yourself, thoughts you have been thinking for decades, it may take some time to change a core belief, but it is possible.\n\nThese tools are so helpful in unraveling religious indoctrination. Think about it, your religious beliefs were most likely instilled in you as a child. You were told what to believe and then had church leaders, family and friends repeat over and over what you should believe. I like to use this as an example of a way that you have changed a fundamental belief, your religious beliefs. This is evidence that you can do this in all areas of your life that you are not satisfied in.\n\nThis tool and other tools I teach my clients can be life changing. If you would like to work one on one with me, schedule a mini session with me and we can find out if we are a good fit and I can tell you about my coaching programs.\n\nBook a session with me here...\nhttps://amylogansschedulecalander.as.me/schedule.php\n\nhttps://www.amyloganlife.com/",

      "description": "Have you ever uttered the words\u2026\n\n\u201CI have trust issues.\u201D ??? \n\nWhat happens every time you say or think these words to yourself?\n\nYou confirm the fact that you have trust issues. You believe that you can\u2019t trust other people. You put up walls. You stay closed. You do not seek out relationships. You have trust issues.\n\nIt is understandable that this is the outcome of having \u201Ctrust issues.\u201D\n\nWhat if? What if? What if? You have had this backwards all along?\n\nWhat happens if you flip this around and start trusting yourself, even if things do not turn out how you thought they would (whatever the circumstance)?\n\nThe fact is, we can never 100% control life, people, and circumstances around us. We can only work on our end of the deal, no matter what who or how, you were betrayed.\n\nThis week\u2019s podcast episode is on my top 5 of favorite podcasts I have released. (including podcasts from Exmormonology)\n\nHave a listen. Think it through. Start rephrasing how you word this in your brain and see what happens inside of you as you do it.\n\n\u201CTrust Issues\u201D puts the onus on the other person. I want you to take the focus off the other person and put it back on you.\n\nWhen you strengthen your ability to trust yourself, \u201Ctrust issues\u201D fade away.\n\nTune in wherever you listen to podcasts or you can always find my latest episode on my website amyloganlife.com.\n\nShare with a friend who is struggling with this too.

      "description": "I was born and raised Mormon, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I spent almost two decades attending the temple and obeying all that was asked of me. I started to have doubts about the mormon church, roughly in 2000. It took me six years to get the courage up to actually follow my own intuition and peek behind the proverbial curtain. 2006 was the year I gave myself permission to look into the history of the mormon church. I did not like what I was reading/studying, it all came crashing down pretty quickly after that.\n\nOnce I deconstructed mormonism, I took my garments off, never to be worn again. It was very freeing. I could not see the control that going through the temple rituals, wearing temple robes while in the temple and wearing my garments day and night during my daily life, had over me. \n\nI grew up in a cult and leaving a cult takes years to heal from. Every decision I made in my life up to that point (2006) was built around how I had been conditioned to believe. I was on the one true path. I belonged to the \u0022one true church.\u0022\n\nLeaving the mormon church is a journey. I have learned so much about myself. Learning to trust myself being the biggest lesson. If you are struggling, know that you making this very personal decision for yourself IS TRUSTING YOURSELF. Follow that knowing. It will be uncomfortable to get to the other side, but being uncomfortable/sad/angry/hurt/betrayed, is what is needed to get to that amazing feeling of freedom when you learn that trusting yourself is not void of difficult emotions, working through those difficult emotions is what sets you free.\n\nhttps://www.amyloganlife.com/\n\n#exmormon #postmormon #exmormonology #highdemandreligion #mormontemple #faithcrisis #leavingmormonism #religioustrauma #faithtransition #exmormonologypodcast #ldstempleclothes #templeritual #garments",

      "description": "#exmormon #faithcrisis #lifecoach\n\nGrowing up in a high demand religion has long lasting effects. I am about 10 in this photo. My mom took me and my little sister up to the Los Angeles Temple for an afternoon trip. It was lovely from what I can remember. We toured the temple grounds, watched a few movies in the Visitor\u2019s Center and took lots of pictures in front of all the statues. This is one of them. The conditioning starts young. We are so impressionable when we are young. It was during this time in my life that I learned, to become a mother was my most high calling in life.\n\nI am a mother and I love being a mother, but I often wonder what it would be like to grow up feeling like deciding to have children is one option for me.\n\nShortly after my faith crisis, when I was still attending church and mostly \u201Cin the closet\u201D about my findings about the church and my complete lack of faith in the church anymore, I walked into the church and down past the other ward\u2019s primary and I could hear the children singing \u201CFollow the Prophet.\u201D It hit me like a ton of bricks. As the children sang loud and proud, their little brains were being indoctrinated.\n\nThese leaves lasting effect on us as adults. I call this The Residual Effect. We have so many beliefs, and conditioning we have to work through as the years unfold, post faith crisis. \n\nIn this episode of Ex\u2022mormon\u2022ology we are going to talk about \u0022The Residual Effect\u0022 and how many old beliefs sneak up on us when we least expect them.

At least most of us.\n\nOnce we can really digest that we never cause someone else\u2019s feelings, it will become easier.

Early days of your paradigm shift.\n\nIt is normal to need time to figure out what steps you want to take next, but it is easy to get stuck in that space. You know why? Because it feels more comfortable to spin in confusion than to take the leap of faith (ironically) and leave, when you have no idea what leaving really feels like. You have no idea what friends and family are going to think. So, it is feels easier to not make any moves. The problem with this is you are feeling all the uncomfortable feelings anyway.\n\nYour brain is trying to protect you from leaving the cave. It is your brains job to protect you from danger.

      "description": "#exmormon #faithcrisis #lifecoach\n\nThere will be pain during your mormon faith crisis. It hurts like nothing else you have experienced. \n\nThe hardest part of your faith crisis is processing it all. We are human and the last thing we want to do is FEEL our pain. We will find a million ways to ignore the pain. But, the truth is, the pain from your faith crisis is like a big beach ball you try to push down under the water. The problem is that it will not stay down. It will keep popping back up until you look at it square in the eye and deal with it.\n\nIt is okay to do an avoidance dance for awhile. Grief and pain are funny that way, they will wait. They will keep coming back around to see if it is time to open up that door.\n\nThis process cannot be rushed.\n\nThe good news is, this is not a race.\n\nBe patient.\n\nBe gentle with yourself.\n\nShow yourself so much compassion.\n\nBe willing to process the grief and pain you are feeling.\n\nIn this episode of Emormonology, I walk you through a few tools to help you with this very heavy process.\n\nTHIS is why you are a hero to me. A mormon faith crisis is not for wimps. This is some of the hardest work you will do, processing grief and pain.",

      "description": "#exmormon #postmormon #faithcrisis\n\nI recently sat down with Crystal Escobar and chatted about her new book, her faith crisis and what she is up to know.  I hope you enjoy!\n\nWhen Crystal Escobar first became a mom, she had a hard time figuring out the balance between being there for her kids and being there for herself. It\u2019s the ultimate mom dilemma: \u201CAm I a good mom if I have passions and interests outside of motherhood?\u201D So many women can relate. They feel guilty about doing anything else outside of simply tending to their kids or their spouses, yet so many women today are finding themselves unfulfilled and stagnant in terms of their purpose.\n\nThere is an abundance of undiscovered talents just waiting to be shared with the world. Ask any woman what her life\u2019s purpose is, and you will undoubtedly hear her respond with a phrase such as \u201CI want to bless other people\u2019s lives.\u201D Finding your pas- sion and purpose is the spark that can ignite a raging fire of joy and enthusiasm within your life.\n\nCrystal began exploring her own personal quest for pur- pose and balance in 2010. She learned to embrace her inner \u201Cmom-treprenuer\u201D and used the blogging platform as a way to keep a personal journal of sorts. She found the time spent writing and sharing her thoughts with others to be extremely rewarding and even therapeutic. There were times she felt guilty for immersing herself into her work. There were times she felt inadequate and insecure while comparing herself to more established household-name bloggers. There were even times when she considered quitting all together, taking a two- year hiatus at one point.\n\nThis is a story of perseverance. Crystal\u2019s blog has evolved into more than just an online journal; it has become a mission for her\u2014a mission to create a community of other \u201Cwannabe balanced\u201D moms who have the desire to become a better version of themselves in motherhood and business, all while juggling the other demands placed upon them. Crystal has been featured on several television news stations for her unique way of pro-moting a balanced life incorporating mind, body, and soul.\n\nAt the age of twenty-seven, Crystal and her husband, Sean, became the youngest-ever millionaires in Isagenix International, a multibillion-dollar nutrition and wellness company, and they retired by the age of thirty-five. Now they spend their time teaching and mentoring others along the same path, putting on yearly events, podcasting, and sharing their lives on Instagram and YouTube. This power couple continues to offer others valu-able insights on how you can make your dreams a reality.\n\nCrystal Escobar\nhttp://www.wannabebalanced.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/wannabebalanced/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/wannabebalanced\nhttps://www.facebook.com/wannabebalanced/\n\nFollow me everywhere!\n\namyloganlife@gmail.com\n\nFollow me on the interwebs...\n\nhttps://amyloganlife.com/ \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/amyloganlife/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/amyloganlife/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/amyloganlife\n\nEdited by https://www.brashstudios.com/",

May be a strange question, but for most of us, we have a dialog that runs through our head about our life experiences. We paint a picture of our past with whatever thoughts we have on repeat.\n\nWhat are yours?\n\nBe very careful, because most of our thoughts are not true, they are our interpretation of things, yet we believe them to be true.\n\nStart paying attention.\n\nI work with my clients on changing the dominate narrative that runs through their heads. Often times the beliefs (thoughts) you have are even subconscious. When we can get to the core beliefs you have about your life, we can start to make changes.\n\n~Amy\n\namyloganlife@gmail.com\n\nFollow me on the interwebs...\n\nhttps://amyloganlife.com/ \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/amyloganlife/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/amyloganlife/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/amyloganlife\n\nEdited by https://www.brashstudios.com/",

      "description": "#exmormon #faithdeconstruction #mormon\n\nAugust 2, 2019 I was a presenter at Sunstone Symposium 2019. It was so much fun!\n\nI am going to break down my presentation in a few different segments for y\u0027all.\n\nI know the journey out of mormonism is multilayered, it surely was for me.\n\nIn this particular segment, I am addressing beliefs. I talk about how our beliefs are just thoughts we have on repeat. This can apply to your beliefs about the mormon church or any church you go to, AND beliefs you have about yourself personally.\n\nStudying the brain is a fascinating thing to do. You are the boss of what goes on in your head and once you can how to look into your brain and thoughts more objectively and really see why you believe what you believe and what is holding you back, you can make huge changes in your life AND learn to move on from this place you find yourself in.\n\nLots of love to you!\n\nAmy \namyloganlife@gmail.com\n\nFollow me on the interwebs...\n\nhttps://amyloganlife.com/ \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/amyloganlife/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/amyloganlife/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/amyloganlife\n\nVideo shot and edited by BrashStudios.com",

It is as if you hadn\u0027t left the church you would never be sad, angry, depressed, frustrated.\n\nTo that I say, that is not how this works.\n\nThat would mean that members can never have a bad day or an emotion other than complete joy, everyday, all day, all the time.\n\nJust because you left the church, does not mean you have to fake having human emotions.\n\nNavigating a faith crisis is a wild ride, at times. What you have been through is huge. It is painful, confusing, and catches you off guard. EVEN after you have come to terms with it. You may be totally happy and content with life most of the time and then every once and awhile you have a hard day. A day when you feel all the sad emotions, again.\n\nIt is okay. You get to feel that way. It does not mean you messed up. It means you are human.\n\nahhh, isn\u0027t that nice?\n\nSo, to those who say those types of things, let them, for they know not what they do or say. ;)\n\nYou got this!\n\nIf you are struggling, and want help moving on, I am here to coach you through it.

Here is my answer.\n\nI recorded this video on June 6th 2019.\n\nI would have added a few things, maybe taken a few things out, but this is my thought process and shooting off the hip about where my beliefs are currently. \n\nI love having discussions on this topic.\n\nI am not here to convince anyone of anything. I am not trying to make you see anything the way I do.\n\nYour spiritual journey is so very personal, to you.\n\nI love this space that I am in now. Hopefully it does not scare you away. I can think back to my mormon self and see that I would have not even been able to compute thoughts along these lines, so no worries if you don\u0027t like it. It is my journey and I am happy with it.\n\nWherever you are along the path of life, keep exploring, studying, asking questions, being open. Life has a way of meandering and evolving.

Many of my client left the church years ago and find that their faith crisis rears its head from time to time and are looking for was to close that chapter.\n\nI am also aware that many people do not need any life coaching and are just fine.\n\nI love what I do and I would love to help you if you find yourself stuck or are looking for ways to deal with family and ways to move on emotionally.\n\nI work with people leaving all sorts of religions too. We all sing a similar song. The feeling of betrayal and loss is real. Anger is real. Pain is real. I love helping you find ways to navigate this process.\n\nYou will get through it and be better for it.\n\nYou are stronger than you think.\n\nWhen you are ready to work with me, send me an email and let\u0027s get started.\n\namyloganlife@gmail.com\n\nIf you never need life coaching, I hope my youtube channel has been of value to you.\n\nSo much love to you,\nAmy\n\nhttps://amyloganlife.com/ \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/amyloganlife/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/amyloganlife/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/amyloganlife\n\nVideo shot and edited by James Rhodimer https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDvy...",

It is multi-layered, for sure.\n\nDealing with changes the church makes as it grows and progresses can bring up all sorts of feelings for us. \n\nThe Mormon church just changed a few things that happen in their temples. Women not needing to veil their faces is one of the changes.\n\nI will be talking about it here.\n\nI know this is a sensitive topic. I am treating it carefully and with respect even tho I show what the veil looks like. \n\nThe church itself shows images of the temple clothing and because women are not required to wear the temple veil in the temple I feel it is okay to talk about.\n\nDo not watch if this topic brings up too much for you. Just know that I am speaking to the issue of change and women and the church.\n\nAt about minute 3:30 I start coaching a bit.\n\nReady to work with me? amyloganlife@gmail.com\n\nFollow me on the interwebs...\n\nhttps://amyloganlife.com/ \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/amyloganlife/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/amyloganlife/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/amyloganlife\n\nVideo shot and edited by James Rhodimer https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDvyf_cLFb3-MTW48Ujb9bg",

      "description": "#postmormon #faithcrisis #lds\n\nI think one of the most exciting parts of leaving religion, in my case mormonism, is finding your new voice.\n\nWhat do you think now?\n\nHow do you want to show up in the world with your new world view?\n\nHow do you want to be?\n\nDo you find yourself biting your tongue?\n\nAre you okay with that?\n\nWhat does your \u0022new authentic self\u0022 even mean?\n\nI seriously love helping guide my life coaching clients through this process. It is the most liberating thing I have to offer my people.\n\nI want you to envision this.\n\nYou have left your faith. You are feeling really good about the decision to leave. Life is moving along just fine, but you know you are still, shying away from speaking out fully, or not even sure what that looks like.\n\nShould you speak out?\n\nHow do you share your new thoughts and world view without fear of constantly being put down or brushed off?\n\nMaybe you keep your mouth shut around family and friends because you are scared of judgement or fear of offending some one..\n\nGood news. You can\u0027t offend anyone. It is their choice to be offended. (Send the offended party my way and I can coach them through that!) lol, no seriously!\n\nInevitably, you want to show up as your new self, with no fear of excessive judgment, right?\n\nWell, guess what? You will be judged. You may loose friends. You may even make someone mad. \n\nThe good news is that is all okay! Once you realize that that will happen, you can deal with it. Not everyone is going to leave and avoid you. Just those who were not really your friends anyway, right?\n\nNow, I am not saying to go around trying to piss people off or even disrupt the flow of family and friends living their religion. They get to live their religion. That is their decision. But, showing up as your new self is totally okay. It can even be done with love and kindness. \n\nThis is a beautiful process.\n\nNo more hiding the coffee maker and the wine. No more hiding your new world view. No more hiding that fact that you are not wearing garments. No more hiding that you no longer go to church. No more feeling scared to say you are agnostic or even atheist, if that is the path you have chosen. No more hiding period.\n\n{{{{{ I could list a gazillion other things that you do not need to hide. But I think you get the point. }}}}}\n\nMy biggest point is that your new voice matters. It matters to you and to your children and even friends and family.\n\nI have been amazed at the people who have messaged me, once I started speaking with my new voice, thoughts and opinions. People started to confide in my that they have been feeling the same way and felt/feel scared and not sure how to move forward.\n\nWell, that is where I come in. I LOVE helping others navigate their way through this strange new world you are finding yourself in.\n\nI would love to guide YOU through this process. I have a huge beautiful tool bag, full of ways to navigate this path.\n\nIt is so possible to step into your beautiful authentic self with confidence.\n\nYou got this.\n\nWatching you step into your new self is one of the most rewarding things I have ever been a part of.\n\nAmy xo ~ \n\namyloganlife@gmail.com\n\nFollow me on the interwebs...\n\nhttps://amyloganlife.com/ \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/amyloganlife/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/amyloganlife/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/amyloganlife\n\nVideo shot and edited by James Rhodimer https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDvyf_cLFb3-MTW48Ujb9bg",

      "description": "#mormon #faithcrisis #postmormon\n\nI get asked questions all the time relating to the big issue of having your name removed from the LDS, Mormon church, or whatever they are calling themselves these days.\n\nThis can be a very difficult decision for so many. So many mormons have deep family roots with lots of lots of members and so the question arises, for some, to remove or not remove their name from the church records after deciding the church is not for you.\n\nMany people, don\u0027t care at all and never have their name removed, because, they don\u0027t identify as mormon and who cares. Other people, like me, felt it was very liberating and empowering to have my name removed.\n\nThen there are others who want to have their name removed, but because Grandma or Mom or Sister or Son or Daughter (you get my drift) may be mad or sad, they do not do it.\n\nI always tell people that you are the adult and you get to make that decision, just like they are an adult and get to make the decision to be mormon. Grandma may get mad or be disappointed, but, she is a big girl and can deal. \n\nAt the end of the day, it is all up to you, but I wanted to address it because so many of you message me about this topic.\n\nSo,  my two cents...\n\nFollow me on the interwebs...\n\nhttps://amyloganlife.com/ \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/amyloganlife/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/amyloganlife/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/amyloganlife\n\nI am a Post Mormon Life Coach.
