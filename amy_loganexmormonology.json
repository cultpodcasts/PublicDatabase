Scared to talk to other #exmos ? Scared to tell your family? Just all around scared? It makes sense that you would be scared. Leaving the church is a big deal. \n\nRemember that the journey you are on is a process. This all takes time. \n\nBelieve it or not, there will come a time when you can look back at your initial faith crisis stage of life and laugh at yourself a wee little bit. If you are listening to this episode, I imagine you are not there currently. That is okay! No rush or no race to your healing. \n\nIt is time for an Exmormonology Pep talk and a story of a extremely nervous Amy at her first time ever exmormon meet up AND a woman in red boots. \n\nI would love to be your life coach and help you navigate this road you find yourself on. My journey began 24 ish years ago. I have been where you are and I can help you feel better. It is what I do.

May seem simple at first, but to really digest these concepts and apply them to your life takes practice.\n\nAs humans, most of us have not be taught how to manage our minds and emotions. To really look at the thoughts you think as little sentences that run through our brains, feels strange at first, they just see true. Especially  if you have been thinking one way your whole life, it feels uncomfortable to change that one way. However, once you can observe your thoughts and see how they create the feelings you feel in your body, you can begin to be more intentional with your thoughts and feelings. This is the part that is life changing in all the best ways.\n\nI always recommend that you start from the point of awareness of the thoughts you think, the stories you have on repeat. If you feel first and think second, start there, with what you are feeling. For example, if you feel a lot of anxiety and you are fully aware of that, can you connect it back to what you are thinking? Once you do that, you will be able to see the thoughts that you want to change and in doing so you will have less anxiety. \n\nThink about it. A belief is a thought we have had on repeat for years and years. If you think, for example, \u0022I am stupid\u0022 or \u0022I am not enough,\u0022 etc. you will feel a certain way when you think this about yourself. This is why it is important to look at your though(s) as little sentence that run across your mind, instead of those thoughts being true. Just because you think a certain way about yourself, does not make it true. This is where you have wiggle room to change core beliefs you have about yourself.\n\nThis process takes time. If you have been thinking certain thoughts about yourself, thoughts you have been thinking for decades, it may take some time to change a core belief, but it is possible.\n\nThese tools are so helpful in unraveling religious indoctrination. Think about it, your religious beliefs were most likely instilled in you as a child. You were told what to believe and then had church leaders, family and friends repeat over and over what you should believe. I like to use this as an example of a way that you have changed a fundamental belief, your religious beliefs. This is evidence that you can do this in all areas of your life that you are not satisfied in.\n\nThis tool and other tools I teach my clients can be life changing. If you would like to work one on one with me, schedule a mini session with me and we can find out if we are a good fit and I can tell you about my coaching programs.\n\nBook a session with me here...\nhttps://amylogansschedulecalander.as.me/schedule.php\n\nhttps://www.amyloganlife.com/",

I was a bit triggered by a few things said by a guest on last weeks show and I want to talk about it, what it means and what it may mean to you. Working your way out of religious scrupulosity is possible. For many it stops the minute your religious beliefs dissipate, for others it may take years to unravel. Either way, I want to talk about what is happening for those of us who tend towards the scrupulous ways of religiously believing, even when we did not know it was a thing that was happening to and within us.",

While I know that the title of this episode may sound like I want to take on the whole affirmation community (if that is a thing), that is not the case. I do believe there is a missing step in the process of how we have been taught to do affirmations. So, this week, I want to teach you the missing piece and speed up the process of getting you to what you want to believe about yourself. This way you get to where you want to go with your life a whole lot quicker! If nothing else, you get to the beliefs you want to believe in a more holistic, moving way, sustainable way.",

I worked as a waitress at the diner. In this week\u0027s episode of The Unorthodox Woman, I recount a remarkable encounter with a charming lady who happened to be working alongside me. While I can\u0027t recall her exact age or even remember her name, she appeared to be in her late 60s or maybe even 70s. (as a 20-year-old, she seemed \u0022old\u0022 to me at the time.) Little did I know that she would impart a lesson that has stayed with me for over 30 years. It involves coffee, a beverage I was not allowed to drink as an active believing member of my church. I have a feeling this story will help you with whatever you are struggling with, as it has helped me with my own struggles throughout my life.",

You believe that you can\u2019t trust other people. You put up walls. You stay closed. You do not seek out relationships. You have trust issues.\n\nIt is understandable that this is the outcome of having \u201Ctrust issues.\u201D\n\nWhat if? What if? What if? You have had this backwards all along?\n\nWhat happens if you flip this around and start trusting yourself, even if things do not turn out how you thought they would (whatever the circumstance)?\n\nThe fact is, we can never 100% control life, people, and circumstances around us. We can only work on our end of the deal, no matter what who or how, you were betrayed.\n\nThis week\u2019s podcast episode is on my top 5 of favorite podcasts I have released. (including podcasts from Exmormonology)\n\nHave a listen. Think it through. Start rephrasing how you word this in your brain and see what happens inside of you as you do it.\n\n\u201CTrust Issues\u201D puts the onus on the other person. I want you to take the focus off the other person and put it back on you.\n\nWhen you strengthen your ability to trust yourself, \u201Ctrust issues\u201D fade away.\n\nTune in wherever you listen to podcasts or you can always find my latest episode on my website amyloganlife.com.\n\nShare with a friend who is struggling with this too. I know it will help. Plus, I talk a bit about Mary Tyler Moore. Who doesn\u2019t love her?!!!\n \nListen wherever you listen to your podcasts.

      "description": "Happy Pride, Wildflowers! June is a special month, filled with vibrant rainbows that illuminate our communities. It\u0027s a time when we come together to celebrate and show our unwavering support for our queer friends. However, it\u0027s important to acknowledge that not everyone shares the same level of acceptance and love. This reality reinforces the significance of celebrating and uplifting the voices of our queer loved ones. As allies, we have a responsibility to stand beside them, amplifying their experiences and advocating for their rights. It is crucial that we make conscious choices with our resources, ensuring we don\u0027t support organizations that oppose equality. One powerful way to become a better ally and understand the struggles faced by the LGBTQIA\u0026#43; community is through education. By learning about the rich history of the LGBTQ movement in the United States, we gain invaluable insights into the progress that has been made and the challenges that remain. This history is a tapestry woven with the resilience, courage, and determination of countless individuals who fought for their rights and the rights of future generations. In this week\u0027s episode, we embark on a journey through time to explore key players and events that have shaped and propelled the fight for equality in the LGBTQIA\u0026#43; movement in our country. By delving into these stories, we can deepen our understanding of the struggles faced by the community, the milestones achieved, and the ongoing work that lies ahead. Each chapter in this history reveals the strength and spirit of a community that refused to be silenced, pushing boundaries and demanding recognition. From the Stonewall Riots in 1969, where transgender women of color led the charge against police brutality and ignited a global movement, to the activism of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay elected official in California, who championed LGBTQ rights until his tragic assassination - these stories serve as reminders of the power of collective action and the transformative impact it can have. Learning about the LGBTQ movement\u0027s history fosters empathy, compassion, and a deeper appreciation for the progress we\u0027ve made while acknowledging the work that remains. It allows us to challenge prejudice and discrimination, inspiring us to create inclusive spaces where all individuals can live authentically and without fear. By embracing the past, we pave the way for a more equitable future. So let us honor the struggles and celebrate the triumphs of the LGBTQIA\u0026#43; movement by educating ourselves, elevating diverse voices, and standing alongside our queer friends with unwavering support and love. Happy Pride, Wildflowers!",

In this inaugural podcast episode I share with you why the change from Exmormonology to The Unorthodox Woman and the direction and plan I have for the vision of this new chapter. Our collective religious, social and familial conditioning has most likely effected you in ways you may not see yet. I coach you through busing out of the boxes we were metaphorically placed in from the minute we were born.

Be careful staying in the place of consuming information, it is most likely turning into a way to buffer from your underlying feelings. \n\nWhen you quiet the noise, you are left with the necessary processing of your heaving emotions and because we are human pleasure seeking creatures, we don\u2019t want to feel pain. But this is the place where the healing can begin. In the quiet in between places. \n\nThis is exactly where I come in as your life coach.

      "description": "About a month or so ago, a friend, a former Jehovah Witness friend, asked me a really great question, Is Healing An Illusion? I loved this questiong so much that I created a podcast around it. Let\u0027s dive into when healing does feel like an illusion and why and what you can do about it so you do not get stuck in the pain of reliving your pain/trauma again and again and again. There is healing in telling/sharing your story, it can be freeing in just doing that, sharing, telling your story to a therapist or friend. Does your story come out the same way again and again? Do you judge yourself for not having \u0022healed\u0022 faster? Is there a time limit on when you are supposed to be healed? In this episode I deep dive into the concept of healing and what we think it should look like and what healing actually looks like AND how you can be an active participant to your own healing, possibly speeding up the process. If you feel like you are on an emotional roller coaster of emotions all the time or that your healing is taking way too long, then this episode of Exmormonology is a very important one for you to listen to Wildflower.",

      "description": "I was born and raised Mormon, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I spent almost two decades attending the temple and obeying all that was asked of me. I started to have doubts about the mormon church, roughly in 2000. It took me six years to get the courage up to actually follow my own intuition and peek behind the proverbial curtain. 2006 was the year I gave myself permission to look into the history of the mormon church. I did not like what I was reading/studying, it all came crashing down pretty quickly after that.\n\nOnce I deconstructed mormonism, I took my garments off, never to be worn again. It was very freeing. I could not see the control that going through the temple rituals, wearing temple robes while in the temple and wearing my garments day and night during my daily life, had over me. \n\nI grew up in a cult and leaving a cult takes years to heal from. Every decision I made in my life up to that point (2006) was built around how I had been conditioned to believe. I was on the one true path. I belonged to the \u0022one true church.\u0022\n\nLeaving the mormon church is a journey. I have learned so much about myself. Learning to trust myself being the biggest lesson. If you are struggling, know that you making this very personal decision for yourself IS TRUSTING YOURSELF. Follow that knowing. It will be uncomfortable to get to the other side, but being uncomfortable/sad/angry/hurt/betrayed, is what is needed to get to that amazing feeling of freedom when you learn that trusting yourself is not void of difficult emotions, working through those difficult emotions is what sets you free.\n\nhttps://www.amyloganlife.com/\n\n#exmormon #postmormon #exmormonology #highdemandreligion #mormontemple #faithcrisis #leavingmormonism #religioustrauma #faithtransition #exmormonologypodcast #ldstempleclothes #templeritual #garments",

      "description": "I am excited to share with all y\u0027all wildflowers a conversation I have with my friend and fellow coach Allison Crow. Allison just released her new book Unarmored: Finding Home in the Wild Edges of Being Human. Allison was raised a devout Christian in the south, Texas. Although not raised mormon, Allison has experienced her own faith crisis. I know you will love our discussion and we ebb and flow about life and heartbreak and healing and busting out of the \u0022being a made up woman my religion taught me to be,\u0022 type of thinking. Allison Crow, M.Ed, is a Life and Self-Leadership coach for small business owners and executives. She has been leading, teaching, speaking, writing, creating, and coaching in one form or another since the mid-1990s. For years, she was a hard-lined performance and sales coach motivated by outside forces and an excruciating need for approval. Now, instead of being driven by hard financial goals and lifeless quotas, Allison has an unconventional and connected practice where delicious and thought provoking conversations are centered around meeting yourself deeply. She helps her clients compassionately work with emotions, thoughts, and behaviors that are natural but often bypassed parts of our human selves. Allison specializes in IFS-informed coaching, deep inner work, creative expression, and building the skills of courageous emotional presence and self-trust. Allison lives in the hill country outside of Austin, Texas, with her husband of fifteen years and her rescued dogs, Leroy Brown and Clementine. She is often seen with a stack of journals, a paintbrush and watercolors, with her phone in her hand, creating and connecting on social media, or floating in the backyard pool she calls her \u201Cchurch.\u201D WWW.ALLISONCROW.COM https://allisoncrow.com/unarmoredthebook/",

Healing does not mean you have landed at the top of healing mountain where rainbows and butterflies live forever and ever and you dance around in gleeful joy and you no longer feel grief, pain or heartache. It means that you learn to hold the space for the tender side of healing and you do not make it mean that anything has gone wrong or that you are not healing. Healing ebbs and flows. Healing takes time. Remember wildflower, there is no rush and no race to this process. Just you and all the time you need. Thank you for letting me walk this path with you.

Or do you just accept the fact (not fact) that you are doomed and it is what it is? One area of your life you may not have connected the dots with, post faith transition, is how your brain thinks about money because of your religious and social conditioning. Today I want to open the door to exploring this topic with you and get to the bottom of why you think the way you to about money. The truth is that you get to think about money any way you want to, so how do YOU think about money?",

I know that can be a loaded question, but when one grows up in a high demand religion and has been taught to put their trust in a curated higher/church authority, it can be a tricky question to answer. This year at Wildflower Weekend we will be slowing down time and focusing on you and a few of your biggest struggles. I imagine, if you feel stuck in any area of your life, it is becuase you are not trusting your ability to have your own back, no matter what. You are letting the fear of a projected future feeling keep you frozen. After this weekend you will feel more confident to make needed changes in your life and take the steps required to get unstuck with any struggle you find yourself in. Set aside September 30th-Oct. 2nd in SLC, Utah. Wildflowers are flying in from around the states and even Canada. Come join us!

I have seen patterns in the way members of the church respond to us. I will be addressing these repeated responses in this essay. I poised it as a an essay to members of the church, but it is really for you and all the things we want to say when we hear the same rhetoric over and over.

I want you to start looking for other areas of your life where you can maybe short cut this process. What are you not believing about yourself that you need a few nudges to see yourself in a different light, just like seeing the church in a different light?

Every time your brain thinks, I have trust issues and you believe it, you have trust issues. By doing this you most likely build up a huge wall around your heart and you don\u0027t let anyone in and therefore you keep stuck in the round and round of having trust issues. Let\u0027s do some thought work around this issue and how you can turn it around and start trusting yourself.",

It is so much easier to stay in a constant state of blame, meaning it is everyone else\u0027s fault for how we feel. Today I want to talk to you about setting down the blame and leaning into deciding how to take full responsibility for all your emotions. No other person gets to determine how you think and feel about yourself. Once you learn how to take full responsibility for your thoughts and emotions, you become unstoppable. Before you tell yourself this is too hard, just be open to believing this is possible for you. That is where you start, with the belief that it is possible. This is why what you think about yourself matters way more than what anyone else thinks of you.",

Anger is a secondary emotion, but I wanted to start with anger because it seems to be a very loud uncomfortable one. This week we are going to find the other emotion(s) and I am going to teach you how to and what to do with it once you find it. Life is a full spectrum of emotions and being able to sit with and process the more difficult ones well help you with all that comes with being human.",

It almost feels like insult to injury that we have to do the work and manage our mental health in this department. But we do. It is up to you to do the work to make sure you are okay. It is like we are speaking a completely different language now and thus communication with our loved ones feels foreign. Join me for Exmoromonology Ep. 56, as I explain this all in detail.

God and The Holy of Holies, a spot for God and Jesus. Kolob, near Kolob. Amy reeealllly loves this wine. GenExers putting the X in Exmo. A different mormonism now??? The church morphing into mainstream christianity. Finding ourselves defending mormonism to outsiders who do not know what they are talking about. Weird in so many ways. Why my podcast name was very intentional. The set up of being labeled an apostate. And more! You really have to listen to the whole episode! We meander. :)",

When I began my journey, many moons ago, the loneliness was so very painful. In this episode, I reflect on the past year (again) and I also discuss some of my intentions with moving forward. I know it can feel like you are stagnant tho, as you process all that you are going through. The truth is you have an amazing big beautiful life ahead of you and you will be a better person for this transition in your life. Keep doing the work. Keep expanding your mind. Keep on keeping on.

      "description": "#exmormon #faithcrisis #lifecoach\n\nGrowing up in a high demand religion has long lasting effects. I am about 10 in this photo. My mom took me and my little sister up to the Los Angeles Temple for an afternoon trip. It was lovely from what I can remember. We toured the temple grounds, watched a few movies in the Visitor\u2019s Center and took lots of pictures in front of all the statues. This is one of them. The conditioning starts young. We are so impressionable when we are young. It was during this time in my life that I learned, to become a mother was my most high calling in life.\n\nI am a mother and I love being a mother, but I often wonder what it would be like to grow up feeling like deciding to have children is one option for me.\n\nShortly after my faith crisis, when I was still attending church and mostly \u201Cin the closet\u201D about my findings about the church and my complete lack of faith in the church anymore, I walked into the church and down past the other ward\u2019s primary and I could hear the children singing \u201CFollow the Prophet.\u201D It hit me like a ton of bricks. As the children sang loud and proud, their little brains were being indoctrinated.\n\nThese leaves lasting effect on us as adults. I call this The Residual Effect. We have so many beliefs, and conditioning we have to work through as the years unfold, post faith crisis. \n\nIn this episode of Ex\u2022mormon\u2022ology we are going to talk about \u0022The Residual Effect\u0022 and how many old beliefs sneak up on us when we least expect them.

VERY uncomfortable.\n\nI know this is a huge piece of your mormon faith crisis process. This is why we stay in the closet for so long. We are afraid of hurting, disappointing, and upsetting our loved ones. Especially mom and grandma. We put this off part of our journey off, for a long as we can. At least most of us.\n\nOnce we can really digest that we never cause someone else\u2019s feelings, it will become easier. If you are afraid to tell mom, or maybe you have, and she has told you how much pain you have caused her, it is her brain, with all of her thoughts and stories that are creating her pain. That may be a new concept to understand. This whole process is about you managing your mind and letting family and friends manage their own mind. \n\nLet me walk you through a few scenarios in this week episode of Exmormonology.",

Your brain is a lot like a child, running around with no supervision. When you can start to see the thoughts in your head as sentences in your brain, you will able to change up the sentences (or thoughts) when they are not helping you.\n\nWe have all been down the negative thought rabbit hole from time to time, if not everyday. We are human, it works this way. BUT, the good news is, you have the power to take the reins back and be the boss of your brain.\n\nSo, when I reference \u201Cthoughts on the loose\u201D I am talking about the thoughts that take over and you start to believe them. You do not have to believe them.\n\nA belief is just a thought on repeat. So, since you are changing up the beliefs (thoughts) you have about the church, we may as well get in your brain and move some of the other negative thoughts around too.\n\nWhen you are ready to begin your healing from your mormon faith crisis, taking your power back is the most liberating thing you can do for yourself.

Early days of your paradigm shift.\n\nIt is normal to need time to figure out what steps you want to take next, but it is easy to get stuck in that space. You know why? Because it feels more comfortable to spin in confusion than to take the leap of faith (ironically) and leave, when you have no idea what leaving really feels like. You have no idea what friends and family are going to think. So, it is feels easier to not make any moves. The problem with this is you are feeling all the uncomfortable feelings anyway.\n\nYour brain is trying to protect you from leaving the cave. It is your brains job to protect you from danger. This goes way back in our DNA as death was certain if we left our tribe. That same brain is trying to keep you safe.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about how to get unstuck and make forward movements after your mormon faith crisis, instead of feeling like you are drowning in limbo land.",

We see it as normal. This is true for the conditioning we have experienced around modesty. We were taught that we, girls and women, are responsible for the thoughts boys/men may have about our bodies and how we dress.

Or any faith crisis, for that matter. My childhood religion just happened to be in mormonism, the church of jesus christ of latter day saints. When you leave your religion, life gets turned upside down for a bit. I call it free falling. \n\nIf you can\u2019t really figure out up from down right now, this podcast is for you. \n\nIf you have been walking this path for awhile now, this podcast is for you. \n\nIf you are ready to finally lay it all to rest, this podcast is for you. If you are on the hamster wheel of all things post mormon, this podcast is for you.\n\nIn this episode I talk about [The] Moment I knew the church was not TRUE for me.\n\nWhat was your moment?\n\nI also share a tool with you so you can start reframing your faith crisis.\n\n~Amy\nhttps://amyloganlife.com/",

      "description": "#exmormon #postmormon #faithcrisis\n\nI recently sat down with Crystal Escobar and chatted about her new book, her faith crisis and what she is up to know.  I hope you enjoy!\n\nWhen Crystal Escobar first became a mom, she had a hard time figuring out the balance between being there for her kids and being there for herself. It\u2019s the ultimate mom dilemma: \u201CAm I a good mom if I have passions and interests outside of motherhood?\u201D So many women can relate. They feel guilty about doing anything else outside of simply tending to their kids or their spouses, yet so many women today are finding themselves unfulfilled and stagnant in terms of their purpose.\n\nThere is an abundance of undiscovered talents just waiting to be shared with the world. Ask any woman what her life\u2019s purpose is, and you will undoubtedly hear her respond with a phrase such as \u201CI want to bless other people\u2019s lives.\u201D Finding your pas- sion and purpose is the spark that can ignite a raging fire of joy and enthusiasm within your life.\n\nCrystal began exploring her own personal quest for pur- pose and balance in 2010. She learned to embrace her inner \u201Cmom-treprenuer\u201D and used the blogging platform as a way to keep a personal journal of sorts. She found the time spent writing and sharing her thoughts with others to be extremely rewarding and even therapeutic. There were times she felt guilty for immersing herself into her work. There were times she felt inadequate and insecure while comparing herself to more established household-name bloggers. There were even times when she considered quitting all together, taking a two- year hiatus at one point.\n\nThis is a story of perseverance. Crystal\u2019s blog has evolved into more than just an online journal; it has become a mission for her\u2014a mission to create a community of other \u201Cwannabe balanced\u201D moms who have the desire to become a better version of themselves in motherhood and business, all while juggling the other demands placed upon them. Crystal has been featured on several television news stations for her unique way of pro-moting a balanced life incorporating mind, body, and soul.\n\nAt the age of twenty-seven, Crystal and her husband, Sean, became the youngest-ever millionaires in Isagenix International, a multibillion-dollar nutrition and wellness company, and they retired by the age of thirty-five. Now they spend their time teaching and mentoring others along the same path, putting on yearly events, podcasting, and sharing their lives on Instagram and YouTube. This power couple continues to offer others valu-able insights on how you can make your dreams a reality.\n\nCrystal Escobar\nhttp://www.wannabebalanced.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/wannabebalanced/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/wannabebalanced\nhttps://www.facebook.com/wannabebalanced/\n\nFollow me everywhere!\n\namyloganlife@gmail.com\n\nFollow me on the interwebs...\n\nhttps://amyloganlife.com/ \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/amyloganlife/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/amyloganlife/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/amyloganlife\n\nEdited by https://www.brashstudios.com/",

You are the boss of what goes on in your head and once you can how to look into your brain and thoughts more objectively and really see why you believe what you believe and what is holding you back, you can make huge changes in your life AND learn to move on from this place you find yourself in.\n\nLots of love to you!\n\nAmy \namyloganlife@gmail.com\n\nFollow me on the interwebs...\n\nhttps://amyloganlife.com/ \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/amyloganlife/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/amyloganlife/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/amyloganlife\n\nVideo shot and edited by BrashStudios.com",

It is as if you hadn\u0027t left the church you would never be sad, angry, depressed, frustrated.\n\nTo that I say, that is not how this works.\n\nThat would mean that members can never have a bad day or an emotion other than complete joy, everyday, all day, all the time.\n\nJust because you left the church, does not mean you have to fake having human emotions.\n\nNavigating a faith crisis is a wild ride, at times. What you have been through is huge. It is painful, confusing, and catches you off guard. EVEN after you have come to terms with it. You may be totally happy and content with life most of the time and then every once and awhile you have a hard day. A day when you feel all the sad emotions, again.\n\nIt is okay. You get to feel that way. It does not mean you messed up. It means you are human.\n\nahhh, isn\u0027t that nice?\n\nSo, to those who say those types of things, let them, for they know not what they do or say. ;)\n\nYou got this!\n\nIf you are struggling, and want help moving on, I am here to coach you through it.

I am not trying to make you see anything the way I do.\n\nYour spiritual journey is so very personal, to you.\n\nI love this space that I am in now. Hopefully it does not scare you away. I can think back to my mormon self and see that I would have not even been able to compute thoughts along these lines, so no worries if you don\u0027t like it. It is my journey and I am happy with it.\n\nWherever you are along the path of life, keep exploring, studying, asking questions, being open. Life has a way of meandering and evolving.

I explain it all in this video. Have a looksie.\n\nI know it can be challenging to move on after you have experienced a faith crisis. I work with people who are in the early stages of their faith crisis, fresh and raw, through every stage thereafter. Many of my client left the church years ago and find that their faith crisis rears its head from time to time and are looking for was to close that chapter.\n\nI am also aware that many people do not need any life coaching and are just fine.\n\nI love what I do and I would love to help you if you find yourself stuck or are looking for ways to deal with family and ways to move on emotionally.\n\nI work with people leaving all sorts of religions too. We all sing a similar song. The feeling of betrayal and loss is real. Anger is real. Pain is real. I love helping you find ways to navigate this process.\n\nYou will get through it and be better for it.\n\nYou are stronger than you think.\n\nWhen you are ready to work with me, send me an email and let\u0027s get started.\n\namyloganlife@gmail.com\n\nIf you never need life coaching, I hope my youtube channel has been of value to you.\n\nSo much love to you,\nAmy\n\nhttps://amyloganlife.com/ \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/amyloganlife/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/amyloganlife/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/amyloganlife\n\nVideo shot and edited by James Rhodimer https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDvy...",

It is multi-layered, for sure.\n\nDealing with changes the church makes as it grows and progresses can bring up all sorts of feelings for us. \n\nThe Mormon church just changed a few things that happen in their temples. Women not needing to veil their faces is one of the changes.\n\nI will be talking about it here.\n\nI know this is a sensitive topic. I am treating it carefully and with respect even tho I show what the veil looks like. \n\nThe church itself shows images of the temple clothing and because women are not required to wear the temple veil in the temple I feel it is okay to talk about.\n\nDo not watch if this topic brings up too much for you. Just know that I am speaking to the issue of change and women and the church.\n\nAt about minute 3:30 I start coaching a bit.\n\nReady to work with me? amyloganlife@gmail.com\n\nFollow me on the interwebs...\n\nhttps://amyloganlife.com/ \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/amyloganlife/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/amyloganlife/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/amyloganlife\n\nVideo shot and edited by James Rhodimer https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDvyf_cLFb3-MTW48Ujb9bg",

      "description": "#postmormon #faithcrisis #lds\n\nI think one of the most exciting parts of leaving religion, in my case mormonism, is finding your new voice.\n\nWhat do you think now?\n\nHow do you want to show up in the world with your new world view?\n\nHow do you want to be?\n\nDo you find yourself biting your tongue?\n\nAre you okay with that?\n\nWhat does your \u0022new authentic self\u0022 even mean?\n\nI seriously love helping guide my life coaching clients through this process. It is the most liberating thing I have to offer my people.\n\nI want you to envision this.\n\nYou have left your faith. You are feeling really good about the decision to leave. Life is moving along just fine, but you know you are still, shying away from speaking out fully, or not even sure what that looks like.\n\nShould you speak out?\n\nHow do you share your new thoughts and world view without fear of constantly being put down or brushed off?\n\nMaybe you keep your mouth shut around family and friends because you are scared of judgement or fear of offending some one..\n\nGood news. You can\u0027t offend anyone. It is their choice to be offended. (Send the offended party my way and I can coach them through that!) lol, no seriously!\n\nInevitably, you want to show up as your new self, with no fear of excessive judgment, right?\n\nWell, guess what? You will be judged. You may loose friends. You may even make someone mad. \n\nThe good news is that is all okay! Once you realize that that will happen, you can deal with it. Not everyone is going to leave and avoid you. Just those who were not really your friends anyway, right?\n\nNow, I am not saying to go around trying to piss people off or even disrupt the flow of family and friends living their religion. They get to live their religion. That is their decision. But, showing up as your new self is totally okay. It can even be done with love and kindness. \n\nThis is a beautiful process.\n\nNo more hiding the coffee maker and the wine. No more hiding your new world view. No more hiding that fact that you are not wearing garments. No more hiding that you no longer go to church. No more feeling scared to say you are agnostic or even atheist, if that is the path you have chosen. No more hiding period.\n\n{{{{{ I could list a gazillion other things that you do not need to hide. But I think you get the point. }}}}}\n\nMy biggest point is that your new voice matters. It matters to you and to your children and even friends and family.\n\nI have been amazed at the people who have messaged me, once I started speaking with my new voice, thoughts and opinions. People started to confide in my that they have been feeling the same way and felt/feel scared and not sure how to move forward.\n\nWell, that is where I come in. I LOVE helping others navigate their way through this strange new world you are finding yourself in.\n\nI would love to guide YOU through this process. I have a huge beautiful tool bag, full of ways to navigate this path.\n\nIt is so possible to step into your beautiful authentic self with confidence.\n\nYou got this.\n\nWatching you step into your new self is one of the most rewarding things I have ever been a part of.\n\nAmy xo ~ \n\namyloganlife@gmail.com\n\nFollow me on the interwebs...\n\nhttps://amyloganlife.com/ \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/amyloganlife/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/amyloganlife/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/amyloganlife\n\nVideo shot and edited by James Rhodimer https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDvyf_cLFb3-MTW48Ujb9bg",

      "description": "#mormon #faithcrisis #postmormon\n\nI get asked questions all the time relating to the big issue of having your name removed from the LDS, Mormon church, or whatever they are calling themselves these days.\n\nThis can be a very difficult decision for so many. So many mormons have deep family roots with lots of lots of members and so the question arises, for some, to remove or not remove their name from the church records after deciding the church is not for you.\n\nMany people, don\u0027t care at all and never have their name removed, because, they don\u0027t identify as mormon and who cares. Other people, like me, felt it was very liberating and empowering to have my name removed.\n\nThen there are others who want to have their name removed, but because Grandma or Mom or Sister or Son or Daughter (you get my drift) may be mad or sad, they do not do it.\n\nI always tell people that you are the adult and you get to make that decision, just like they are an adult and get to make the decision to be mormon. Grandma may get mad or be disappointed, but, she is a big girl and can deal. \n\nAt the end of the day, it is all up to you, but I wanted to address it because so many of you message me about this topic.\n\nSo,  my two cents...\n\nFollow me on the interwebs...\n\nhttps://amyloganlife.com/ \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/amyloganlife/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/amyloganlife/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/amyloganlife\n\nI am a Post Mormon Life Coach.

Hundreds more tuned in on line.\n\nIn this video I share some clips of the day and also share some of my thoughts about the process of excommunication.\n\nOne thing I didn\u0027t talk about in this video is the fact that we have been so conditioned to think that sending our children into a one on one interview with a man, alone, is normal.

This can be a very sensitive topic to a mormon deciding if the practice of wearing garments should be observed. In this vlog I talk a bit about it. http://soulsearchinggirl.com/",

My particular crisis of faith had to do with mormonism, but leaving a deeply rooted believe, no matter the faith, can feel very isolating. In this video I share my why with you. You are not alone and you are not crazy for having the thoughts and feelings you are having.",

Here is a memory from my past and a possible happening in the future regarding mormon weddings. Basically heart on sleeve. I share so those of you going through this process know you are not alone. There are many of us who have gone before you and understand. I will be focusing on the positive life after leaving from here on out. There is life after mormonism and it is good.\n\nChannel Donation   https://paypal.me/amyloganlife\n\nwww.amyloganlife.com\n\nVideo shot and edited by James Rhodimer https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDvyf_cLFb3-MTW48Ujb9bg",

I got talking about my doubts and this is part of what unfolded.\n\n I share this vlog with you as an insight to my thinking process and the connections I started making through my leaving the church mindset. Leaving mormonism is only part of my journey. But it was such a large part of my life that I still try to work through some of the conditioning and effects it has/had in my life.\n\nI do not quote references and I do not even mention the TON of information available regarding Joseph Smith and polygamy. It was just a stream of thought. Enjoy.",
