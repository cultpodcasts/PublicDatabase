How does an ordinary woman from Yelm, Washington, become the channel for a 35,000-year-old warrior spirit? And how does that turn into a multi-million-dollar new-age empire?

      "description": "When does a religious group become a cult? In this episode, we venture into the scandalous world of the Community Chapel and Bible Training Center, nestled in the quiet community of Normandy Park, Washington (Shea\u0027s former home). This Pentecostal religious group had a dark underbelly of secrets and peculiar sexual practices, prompting speculation of cult-like tendencies veiled behind the guise of spirituality. This story of lust and faith in the Pacific Northwest has it all-money, sex, demons, ugly carpet-even murder.
