      "description": "This week we are transported to Tree Hill, North Carolina thanks to Bethany Joy Lenz\u0027s memoir. The actress, best known for her role as Haley on One Tree Hill, has written a vulnerable and honest account of her time in a religious cult. We talk about the power of high control groups, how to recognize gaslighting, and how her story shed new light on her role on a fan favorite show. We discuss the iconic TV show, the rewatch podcast, and our hopes for Lenz in the future. In our catch up this week, Kaitlin shares about her first few nights in her new house, Steph shows gratitude as her first season volunteering at the barn winds down, and Molly gushes about Steph\u0027s cooking at Friendsgiving. In what we\u0027re reading this week, Kaitlin is starting a thriller, Steph returns to an author whose prose always moves us, and Molly devours a small town romance.
