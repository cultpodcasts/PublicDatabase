The leader, Ishmael Chokurongerwa, and seven senior members were arrested on charges of child abuse and illegal burials under their belief of a so called religious cult. Dozens of women and children were rescued from the alleged  cult\u0027s farm, where authorities discovered grave sites with secret burials, including seven children. Rufaro Deshe a  Human Rights lawyer will help us unpack legal implications of this case.",
