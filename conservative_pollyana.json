Instead of listening or taking a report, the officer repeatedly deflects, minimizes, and insists \u0022it\u0027s not a criminal matter\u0022 refusing to take me seriously or investigate.\n\nThis is a prime example of institutional gaslighting, silencing victims, and circumnavigating reality to avoid accountability. \n\nWatch in disbelief as every concern is beaten around the bush and dismissed outright. \n\nTrigger warning: Victim silencing, minimization of sexual assault/trafficking.\n\nShare if you\u0027ve experienced similar institutional failure. Victims deserve to be heard.\n\n\n #HumanTrafficking #VictimSilencing #SurreyPolice",
