      "description": "Share this with anyone who has been to American Addiction Centers (AAC) or knows someone who has. This video only begins to touch the immense grief and harm caused.\n\nWatch in a quiet space because this content is disturbing. It provides a brief overview of the manipulative practices AAC uses, including deceptive advertising and failure to deliver promised care.\n\n0:00 Shocking Neglect: 14.5 Hours Alone\nDramatic opening testimony reveals how a patient was left completely unattended for 14.5 hours overnight with no vital signs checks, no monitoring, and no staff intervention revealing the dangerous gaps in care and the disappearance of key surveillance footage that should have documented the events.\n\n1:00 Inside AAC: The Profit-Driven Nightmare\nAn introduction to American Addiction Centers (AAC) as a large nationwide chain, including major facilities like River Oaks in Florida and loosely affiliated offsite halfway houses and sober living placements, where oversight is often minimal and profit motives appear to override patient safety.\n\n2:00 Honoring the Lost: Names You Need to Know\nA solemn roll call of individuals reported to have died on AAC premises or shortly after discharge due to alleged care failures, including Stone Galloway, Joe Nicolos, Jean Graham Hill, Sean Rena, Connor Johnson, Cody Arbuckle, and others representing at least 50 preventable deaths families have documented in the petition.\n\n3:00 The Petition Ignites: Patterns of Failure\nClelia Jane Sheppard\u0027s Change.org petition calls for formal investigations by The Joint Commission, Florida regulators, SAMHSA, and federal authorities, citing repeated patterns: unsecured campuses allowing drugs to enter freely, heavy reliance on 911 instead of internal medical response, abrupt discharges without support, and corporate tactics like name changes, bankruptcies, and shell entities to avoid accountability.\n\n4:30 Cody\u0027s Heartbreaking Story \u2013 Betrayed \u0026 Abandoned\nThe central case of Cody Arbuckle: after being harassed throughout the day, pleading for help through a window, and being isolated in detox by management, he was found dead the next morning having been left alone for 14.5 hours with zero checks or monitoring, despite families being promised constant supervision and safety.\n\n6:00 River Oaks Exposed: Overdoses \u0026 433 Emergency Calls\nDuring the height of the fentanyl crisis, River Oaks saw multiple overdoses in short time frames, drugs smuggled onto campus, spiked drinks, and delayed recognition of medical emergencies. Public records document 433 calls to 911 in just the facility\u0027s first two years often occurring at night, on weekends, and holidays when on-site leadership was not present turning emergency response into a routine rather than prevention.\n\n\n7:30 Attorney Drops Truth: Kickbacks \u0026 The Florida Shuffle\nTampa attorney Jack Gordon provides detailed insight into offsite locations using separate LLCs for corporate separation, commission structures that incentivized admissions over care, kickbacks in the \u0022body brokering\u0022 model, and the \u0022Florida Shuffle\u0022 a cycle where patients are moved through levels of treatment, discharged when insurance runs out, and readmitted upon relapse to generate more billing.\n\n9:00 Hidden Horrors: Abuse, Overbilling \u0026 Corporate Cover-Ups\nAdditional allegations include excessive urine drug testing billed at extreme markups, exploitation of ACA subsidies through overbilling, use of NDAs to silence complaints, rebranding and shell companies to evade scrutiny, and reports of serious abuse (including a case involving a minor at an offsite location). AAC has publicly denied wrongdoing, but families maintain that denial does not equal real accountability.\n\n10:30 Demand Justice \u2013 Sign the Petition Now\nA powerful call to action: viewers are urged to sign and share Clelia Jane Sheppard\u0027s petition, pressure regulators for transparency and reform, and research any treatment facility carefully\u2014asking tough questions about safety protocols because recovery should never become a profit-driven system built on preventable loss and human suffering\n\nThe full interview with J. Esquire is available under \u201CFlorida Lawyer Discusses Addiction Treatment Industry.\u201D\n\n\nToo many families and individuals searching for help end up exploited by people addicted to money rather than committed to recovery.\n\nThere are those who circle your pain, not to help, but to profit, like predators in the tide.  Not everyone is a friend...some feed on your suffering $$$\n\nSpecial thanks to my mother for lending her voice to this narration.",

      "description": "EXPOSED: What a Florida Lawyer Really Thinks About the Addiction Treatment Industry \u0026 American Addiction Centers \n\nIn this raw phone call from 2023, I spoke with a seasoned litigation specialist who\u0027s sued rehab facilities like River Oaks (part of American Addiction Centers - AAC) for years. \n\nHe pulls no punches: Hotline \u0022experts\u0022 are often just salespeople with financial incentives to fill beds (they changed this after one of his lawsuits!).\nMany facilities deliberately stay unregulated to avoid medical standards, staffing requirements, and real oversight.\nPatients in crisis (like fentanyl withdrawal or severe mental health episodes) are flown across the country, away from family \u2014 not for \u0022triggers,\u0022 but to isolate them from anyone who might pull them out.\n\n\nTragic stories: Destroyed surveillance video in the Graham Hill case, preventable deaths (like Stone Galloway \u0026 others), underqualified staff, and a business model that prioritizes profit over lives.\n\nFake accreditations, paid reviews, and structures designed to maximize billing while minimizing care.\n\nHe says the vast majority of these places are \u0022bad\u0022 and \u0022all about the money.\u0022 Real change comes from lawsuits forcing policy shifts and lobbying legislators for better regulation... not petitions alone.\n\nThis isn\u0027t just my story.   It\u0027s an industry-wide issue backed by lawsuits, investigations, and heartbreaking losses. \n\nIf you\u0027ve been affected by AAC or similar facilities, share below. We need accountability.\n\nSign \u0026 share the petition to investigate AAC: \n\nhttps://www.change.org/p/investigate-american-addiction-centers-preventable-deaths-overdoses#addictiontreatment \n\n\n #RehabExposed #AmericanAddictionCenters #RiverOaks #PatientSafety #FollowTheMoney #MentalHealth #Recovery",

Instead of listening or taking a report, the officer repeatedly deflects, minimizes, and insists \u0022it\u0027s not a criminal matter\u0022 refusing to take me seriously or investigate.\n\nThis is a prime example of institutional gaslighting, silencing victims, and circumnavigating reality to avoid accountability. \n\nWatch in disbelief as every concern is beaten around the bush and dismissed outright. \n\nTrigger warning: Victim silencing, minimization of sexual assault/trafficking.\n\nShare if you\u0027ve experienced similar institutional failure.
