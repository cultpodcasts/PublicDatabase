      "description": "Today we are re-introducing Sandra Tanner to a new generation of Mormons, exMormons, and never-Mormons. Both Sandra and her husband Jerald have strong Mormon backgrounds. When he was only eighteen, Jerald began to have doubts about his faith. When they began dating, Sandra Tanner also began to doubt. Throughout the 60s, 70s and 80s Jerald and Sandra Tanner were among the first to begin publishing on the problems with Mormon history and its truth claims. They opened a bookstore called the Utah Lighthouse Ministry and began publishing their research. Today we are going to talk about their discoveries on topics such as changes to the Book of Mormon, the problems with the Book of Abraham translation, the Kinderhook plates, how the Church covered up problematic parts of its history, and how they impacted hundreds of people in and out of the Mormon church.

But behind the wholesome image was a much darker reality. With counselor Jodi Hildebrandt\u2019s influence, the Franke family spiraled into a nightmare. Now, in Devil in the Family: The Fall of Ruby Franke, the Frankes\u2019 eldest children, Shari and Chad, and Ruby\u2019s husband, Kevin, speak out for the first time.

      "description": "For nearly two centuries, Joseph Smith\u2019s involvement in polygamy has been a point of controversy. Historians and more recently,\u00A0LDS leaders, have\u00A0affirmed\u00A0that the Mormon prophet took dozens of wives. But a growing movement within the Church is challenging that narrative, arguing that Smith was a monogamist\u2014and that polygamy was a later invention used to justify the actions of Brigham Young and other church leaders.\n\nOne of the most vocal advocates of this perspective is Michelle Stone, creator of 132 Problems: Revisiting Mormon Polygamy, a YouTube channel with nearly 120,000 subscribers. A lifelong member of the LDS Church, Michelle once had a strong testimony of polygamy, believing it was divinely inspired. But everything changed ten years ago when her husband questioned whether polygamy was ever truly of God. Determined to prove him wrong, Michelle embarked on a deep dive into historical records\u2014only to find herself questioning whether Joseph Smith practiced polygamy at all.\n\nNow, she joins Mormon Stories to share her research, her faith journey, and why she believes the Church has it wrong on one of the most controversial chapters in its history.\n\n___________________\n\nAt Mormon Stories we explore, celebrate, and challenge Mormon culture through in-depth stories told by members and former members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as well as scholars, authors, LDS apologists, and other professionals.  \n\nOur overall mission is to: \n1.

      "description": "When Mormon missionaries are sent abroad, the Church often takes their passports under the pretense of \u201Ckeeping them safe.\u201D However, many missionaries report feeling trapped, unable to leave on their own terms. This was the reality for Kevin and Jen Lundquist\u2019s son in Lithuania, where his mission president not only refused to let him return home but also subjected him to unethical, pseudoscientific psychological treatment that worsened his depression. Desperate to free their son, Kevin used his connections and issued a serious warning to the Church.

      "title": "Mormon Church Changes Children Polygamy Lesson After Online Criticisms | Ep. 1995",
      "description": "In December 2024, the Mormon Church released a new chapter in the children\u2019s Doctrine and Covenants Stories on the topic of polygamy. In that chapter they discuss how God sometimes commands his people to live polygamy and how hard it was for Joseph Smith to obey. The chapter also discusses how Joseph\u2019s wife Emma did not want her husband to marry other women. Children were even taught that some of the brethren were arrested and put in prison for living polygamy.\n\nAfter the release of that chapter many people spoke up, criticizing the church for this new content. Many believed these stories were too heavy for children and that by releasing this chapter the Mormon Church was actively teaching a story of sexual assault and grooming.\n\nToday we learned that the church changed this chapter. Certain phrasing was removed as well as entire sections of the chapter. Is this due to online criticism of the church teaching children polygamy? Does the Mormon Church cave under pressure? Join us today as John, Julia (from Analyzing Mormonism), and Alyssa Witbeck discuss these changes.\n\nShow Notes: https://www.mormonstories.org/mormon-church-changes-childrens-polygamy-lesson/\n\n___________________\n\nAt Mormon Stories we explore, celebrate, and challenge Mormon culture through in-depth stories told by members and former members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as well as scholars, authors, LDS apologists, and other professionals.  \n\nOur overall mission is to: \n1.

      "description": "A 15 question quiz has been designed to facilitate healthy discussions about factual LDS Church history, and LDS Church historical transparency. It should take less than 5 minutes to complete.\n\nAudience: This quiz is for anyone who has ever been an LDS Church member, including active and inactive LDS Church members, and former LDS. Please take this quiz yourself, and then please invite family, friends, and (most importantly) LDS church leaders and missionaries to take the quiz as well.\n\nWe are hopeful that the survey can serve as a way for you and others to healthily discuss factual LDS Church history, as well as the LDS Church\u0027s overall record of historical transparency. NOTE: All of the historical facts below have been recognized by the LDS church as valid, to the best of our understanding. References have been included for discussion.\n\nWe will be awarding a modest number of cash awards to those who complete the survey in its entirety, and who are willing to share compelling insights or experiences - which might include coming on the podcast to discuss their experiences.  We are also considering the option of administering this survey as a scientific, random survey.  If you are interested in supporting such a project, feel free to donate at the link below.\n\nEnjoy! And please email us with any feedback or experiences you\u0027d like to share.\n\nSurvey link: https://forms.gle/3o7Tr6ZHKzoEBpMs8\n\nTo donate to this project: https://donorbox.org/ldschurchresearch",

He opens up about his childhood, feeling isolated due to his neurodivergence, and his complicated relationship with his family. Paul shares his path to Mormonism, how he felt a strong connection to the faith at first, and his experiences as a missionary, including the challenges he faced in Argentina. Over time, he became disillusioned with the church, particularly after learning new information and struggling with its stance on LGBTQ issues. As Paul navigates life post-church, he discusses his career, his evolving understanding of love and relationships, and the healing process through music and self-reflection.

Despite being excommunicated for questioning the church, Runnells\u2019 CES Letter, published in 2013, exposes discrepancies in the official narrative. Meanwhile, Sweat\u2019s art, starting in 2014, delves into controversial topics like Joseph Smith\u0027s treasure digging, the use of a seer stone, and polygamy. We compare Sweat\u0027s paintings to the CES Letter\u0027s criticisms, highlighting how the church\u2019s history is often presented inaccurately.

      "description": "January 9 saw the release of a new Netflix series, American Primeval, set in the context of mid-19th-century Utah. Though the series is fictionalized, many of the events and peoples depicted are real, including the Utah War, the Mountain Meadows Massacre, the Mormon settlers, and the Shoshone, Ute, and Paiute Indians.\r\n\r\nHistorians Barbara Jones Brown and Darren Parry join host John Dehlin for this live podcast to answer viewer\u0027s questions about which aspects of the series are factual and which are historical fiction. Barbara is co-author of Vengeance Is Mine: The Mountain Meadows Massacre and Its Aftermath, and Darren is the author of The Bear River Massacre: A Shoshone History. Barbara and Darren offer a unique perspective because they are not only historians of this time period in Utah, they are direct descendants of peoples depicted in the mini-series--Darren is Northwestern Shoshone, and Barbara is a descendant of perpetrators of the horrific massacre at Mountain Meadows.\n\nShow Notes: https://www.mormonstories.org/american-primeval-historians-and-descendants-respond/\n\n___________________\n\nAt Mormon Stories we explore, celebrate, and challenge Mormon culture through in-depth stories told by members and former members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as well as scholars, authors, LDS apologists, and other professionals.  \n\nOur overall mission is to: \n1.

      "description": "A recent article from the Salt Lake Tribune showcases how the Mormon church education commissioner Clark Gilbert has implemented stringent measures to ensure that faculty members across church-affiliated institutions, including Brigham Young University and BYU-Idaho, align with the church\u2019s teachings. Professors are now facing many hardships. Their social media posts are being audited, many are being fired for showing LGBTQ\u002B and feminist support, or for experiencing doubts in their Mormon beliefs. Some professors are being terminated simply because their spouse stopped believing in the church. Top scholars no longer want to apply to BYU and many professors are seeking employment elsewhere. These changes have led many to argue that this approach suppresses academic freedom and creates an environment of fear among BYU faculty members, who may feel pressured to conform to specific interpretations of Mormon church doctrinal teachings to maintain their position. \r\n\r\nJoin us today as we talk in-depth about these controversies and the recent news article from the Salt Lake Tribune titled \u0022Dark Days: BYU professors are running scared as premier LDS school steps backwards.\u0022 According to the US and World News Report, BYU ranked #61 in 2017 and then dropped to #109 in 2024 out of 436 National Universities, but are these new changes going to drop the university\u0027s ranking?

      "description": "In this episode, Samantha, John, and Gerardo unpack the fallout from a leaked audio clip of BYU Football captain and former Mormon Missionary Tyler Batty\u2019s explicit halftime speech, recorded outside the locker room at Mountain America Stadium in Tempe, Arizona. The speech, featuring vulgar language, has raised questions about BYU\u2019s Honor Code, which strictly forbids profanity, vulgar language, and other conduct unbecoming of its standards. The controversy became even more interesting when BYU Coach Kalani Sitake defended Batty, calling his actions necessary for \u201Chelping the program.\u201D Meanwhile, KSL, owned by the LDS Church, published an opinion piece telling critics to \u201Cget over it,\u201D dismissing calls for accountability or discipline for Batty. We will explore the deeper implications of the incident, questioning whether public figures like Batty enjoy privileges denied to regular students\u2014especially minorities\u2014who are often held to stricter standards.

      "description": "Join us as we dive deep into the unique experiences of several women navigating life in and outside of Mormonism. From patriarchal blessings and missions to the complexities of dating, marriage, and personal revelation, these stories explore the pressure to conform to Church expectations and the personal growth that comes from questioning them. We discuss YSA culture, worthiness interviews, and the Church\u0027s teachings on relationships, consent, and sexuality. The women share their experiences with dating apps, \u0022soaking,\u0022 and the confusion between spiritual promptings and anxiety. Other key topics include the Church\u0027s influence on women\u2019s roles, the challenges of single life, political and faith landscapes, and deconstructing teachings like the Family Proclamation. With insights into the CES Letter, Joseph Smith\u2019s history, and financial concerns, this video offers a candid, thought-provoking look at life within the Mormon framework and beyond.\n\nShow Notes: https://www.mormonstories.org/dating-as-mormon-young-woman/\n\n___________________\n\nAt Mormon Stories we explore, celebrate, and challenge Mormon culture through in-depth stories told by members and former members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as well as scholars, authors, LDS apologists, and other professionals.  \n\nOur overall mission is to: \n1.

Historically, leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints identified Native Americans as the Lamanites. But as we approach the early 2000s, new theories have emerged.

Mormon apologists are attempting just that with controversial \u0027skin of blackness\u0027 passages in the Book of Mormon.

She shares raw accounts of bishop interviews, religious scrupulosity, and the pressure to conform to church standards. As a young adult, Elisha threw herself into church devotion, only to later confront doubts that would unravel her faith. Her candid reflections on marriage, parenthood, and personal growth in the wake of leaving Mormonism offer valuable insights for anyone navigating religious transitions.

This clash between free-thinking scholars and conservative leaders like Joseph Fielding Smith led to attempts at excommunication, spy infiltration, and the firing of liberal educators. Amidst this tension, Church President David O. McKay emerged as an unexpected protector of intellectual freedom. The period also saw the church grappling with civil rights issues and racial policies, as public pressure forced leaders to confront their teachings. This tumultuous era set the stage for decades of struggle between faith, scholarship, and authority in Mormonism.",

Expecting her experience to be one based on love and service, Rian was instead met with strict rules, surveillance, and spiritual turmoil as she continually felt forced to act against her own conscience \u0026 integrity. As the oppressive atmosphere coupled with isolation due to the initial rise of COVID began to take its toll on her mental and physical health, Rian cherished her weekly calls with her family. That is, until her family\u2019s mounting concern for Rian\u2019s welfare coincided with their loss of faith in the church. As Rian battled depression and suicidal thoughts, her mission leaders\u0027 response was shocking: accusations of pride and instructions to cut ties with her doubting family. Certain that their concern for Rian\u2019s spiritual well-being was superior to the love her \u201Cfallen\u201D family had to offer back home, her Mission President and his wife insert themselves as surrogate parents for the remainder of her mission and beyond. Despite this initial interference, Rian finds herself facing her own faith crisis. As she considers what the actions of her \u201Cmission parents\u201D truly cost her, Rian discovers for herself the real meaning of family, and her family had it all along.",

      "description": "In this compelling rebroadcast (first time on youtube), we revisit John Dehlin\u0027s 2012 interview with Tom Phillips, a U.K. convert and former LDS stake president whose close friendships with LDS leaders like Harold Hillam, Gordon Hinkley, Russel Ballard, and Jeffrey Holland likely led to the invitation to receive the religion\u0027s most exclusive ordinance, the Second Anointing. However, Tom\u0027s journey would soon take an unexpected turn after taking part in the secretive ritual which would have repercussions for his place among the community and even his own family. Since the original episode, an intriguing twist has emerged: Tom\u0027s son, Alan, has ascended to the role of General Authority in the Church, despite his father\u0027s well-documented disaffection. This development adds a poignant layer to an already complex narrative of faith, doubt, and family dynamics within the LDS Church. Whether you\u0027re hearing this story for the first time or revisiting it with fresh ears, Tom Phillips\u0027 journey continues to resonate, raising thought-provoking questions about faith, truth, and the accountability and privilege of Mormonism\u0027s top leaders.",

Please email her production company if you are interested. \u0022To all my Bad Mormons \u2013 The last few years have brought me so many incredible experiences and opportunities, but by far the most formative has been being able to work through my faith transition with the church amongst a community of people who understood and support my experiences.

These events stand in stark contrast to what we thought was a hopeful shift in welcoming LGBT married couples in the Church. Here are a few questions for the Church: What happened? Is the right to preserve one\u0027s membership intact a privilege reserved only for select LGBT Mormons? How is the Church guiding these decisions? Are divine revelations to local leaders influenced by the affluence of their congregations? Is God giving different revelations depending on the level of backlash anticipated from local members?

As a feminist trapped in a patriarchal system, she recounts the jarring experience of going through the temple for the first time, feeling like she had entered a cult. Despite her discomfort, she persevered for decades, until the cognitive dissonance and oppression of women triggered debilitating panic attacks and a mental health crisis. Lori\u0027s courageous story is a testament to the strength it takes to break free from indoctrination, find one\u0027s authentic self, and embrace true peace and equality outside the confines of orthodoxy. Her raw honesty about the harmful effects of Mormonism on women\u0027s mental health and her path to healing and purpose will resonate deeply with anyone who has struggled to reconcile their beliefs with their lived experience.

He delves into the trauma of being constantly stared at and \u0022othered\u0022 on BYU\u0027s overwhelmingly white campus, receiving vile racist abuse and death threats just for daring to speak truth to power. Sebastian\u0027s story is a raw, unsettling wake-up call about the insidious persistence of racism, even in religious communities that preach love and equality.

From uncovering disturbing details in the Gospel Topics Essays that left her questioning everything she knew, to grappling with the church\u0027s dishonesty about its history and finances, to watching her oldest daughter develop scrupulosity, Summur holds nothing back. Her brutally honest account of deconstructing her lifelong beliefs is equal parts heartbreaking and empowering. You\u0027ll be on the edge of your seat as she navigates the challenges of a mixed-faith marriage, learning how to have open and loving discussions despite diverging worldviews. Summur\u0027s raw vulnerability and unrelenting search for truth and meaning will leave you reflecting on your own spiritual journey long after the interview ends.

      "description": "What happens when a multiracial woman raised in a loving family that valued advocacy, positivity, and education joins the Mormon church? Summur\u0027s fascinating journey takes you from her NFL player father desegregating a team, to her mother fiercely protecting her from bullies and racism. Despite nurturing experiences at home, Summur faced harsh judgments and segregationist attitudes at church - a stark contrast that began shaping her doubts. Her path winds through BYU, an African American Studies class that unveiled new perspectives, and a traumatic racist cop incident, before working as a flight attendant and meeting her husband. With a unique multicultural lens, Summur shares the powerful family influences, eye-opening experiences, and pivotal moments like a young girl\u0027s innocent \u0022Look mommy, a Lamanite\u0022 comment that led her to fundamentally question certain Mormon teachings and toxic cultures like purity culture. Prepare for an insightful, thought-provoking journey through the eyes of a Black Mormon woman. Episode Show Notes YouTube Link Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

This riveting interview takes a deep dive into the church\u0027s recent Women\u0027s Devotional - an event intended to empower female members but one that generated significant controversy. Hear candid analysis unpacking the mixed messaging around their supposed \u0022power and authority\u0022, and the perceived dissonance between leader\u0027s rhetoric and the reality of women\u0027s restricted roles. No topic is off-limits in this thought-provoking look at how the devotional aimed to honor women\u0027s divine roles while still upholding traditional male leadership.

      "description": "Ever wonder what happens when a faithful Mormon Bible scholar has a crisis of faith and steps away from the religion he dedicated his life to? David Bokovoy\u0027s candid interview takes you on a riveting personal journey from staunch believer to \u0022spiritual atheist.\u0022 He pulls no punches in describing how the Church\u0027s controversial 2015 LGBTQ\u0026#43; policy shattered his worldview, leading him to lose his testimony and leave Mormonism behind. With raw honesty and hard-won wisdom, he shares profound insights about the transformative power of education from his work in prison rehabilitation. He grapples with weighty questions of free will, authenticity, and human connection. You\u0027ll be captivated by his stories of finding the \u0022Holy Ghost\u0022 outside of religion, confronting trauma through therapy, and continually evolving his understanding of truth. Brimming with thought-provoking perspectives on everything from ADHD to patriarchy to psychedelics, Bokovoy\u0027s interview is a must-see for anyone on their own journey of self-discovery beyond rigid belief systems.

In these highly-anticipated episodes of Mormon Stories Podcast, we interview David Bokovoy - one of Mormonism\u0027s leading Bible scholars. David has an MA from Brandeis University in Jewish Studies and a Ph.D. in Hebrew Bible and the Ancient Near East. He worked for the LDS Church Education System for 18 years, was chaplain at Harvard University, and taught LDS Institute at Harvard, Wellesley, and MIT. He is the author of 2 books including Authoring the Old Testament: Genesis-Deuteronomy, dozens of articles, and was a co-founder of the Mormon Interpreter with Daniel C. Peterson. This interview focuses on David\u0027s personal faith journey, including his fascinating story of falling in love with the Hebrew language and deeply studying the Bible\u2014to forgoing a possibly more lucrative academic career to move to Utah to teach in the Church Educational System.

      "description": "John Larsen explores the role of Satan in Mormon theology, including his origins, powers, and purpose. Key topics discussed are the problems of evil and human agency, Mormon concepts of the afterlife, the elaborate powers ascribed to Satan, theological issues like why an all-powerful God would allow Satan to thrive or even reward him in the end. Larsen argues these issues point to flaws in the Mormon Plan of Salvation and suggests Satan must be part of the Godhead, concluding that Mormon doctrines concerning Satan lead to profound philosophical problems in Mormon theology.

Michael Quinn, from being arch-enemies due to their clashing views on Mormon history, to gaining an appreciation for Quinn\u0027s tireless research into difficult aspects of LDS history, even as she remains puzzled by his persistent belief in Mormonism despite uncovering many factual problems. Sandra highlights Quinn\u0027s lifelong quest to reconcile his faith with the uncomfortable realities he uncovered, his struggles with Church leadership over his historical writings, the irony of him publishing an anti-Tanner pamphlet, and the sadness of his eventual excommunication which rejected both him as a person due to his sexuality and his meticulously researched historical analysis which the Church disliked. Ultimately, Sandra expresses a wish that Quinn was still alive to have an open discussion given their intertwined, conflicted past. Chosen Path: A Memoir: Quinn, D.

Brian shares intimate details about his experiences with Mormon rules around sexuality and how he tested whether sinning really caused loss of the Spirit. Ultimately, Brian found peace and healing after leaving the LDS church, regaining relationships with his kids, and finding a healthier marriage outside Mormonism.

With empathy and nuance, they peel back the curtain on issues like LGBTQ exclusion, leader worship, doubted spiritual \u0027gifts\u0027, unhealthy perfectionism, and the people left wounded when conference talks supersede mental health expertise - all while recognizing the very real human desire to do good amidst institutions not structured to support it.

Despite feeling unprepared, she experienced the birth of her first child within the confines of Mormon teachings, grappling with the disconnection she felt towards motherhood and the expectations placed upon women.

She confronts the sexist doctrines and rituals of the faith, ultimately realizing the toxicity of the environment and its limitations on her identity and well-being. Through personal and familial trials, including PTSD and infertility, Tara navigates her disillusionment with Mormonism, finding solace in stepping away from its constraints and embracing a more liberated perspective on life and motherhood.

Raised with four biological siblings, she navigates her identity as a black girl in Utah, where she initially struggles to recognize her racial difference. Despite feeling out of place, she engages with Mormonism deeply, experiencing conflicting emotions about her faith and cultural identity. Tara\u0027s journey evolves through high school, where she grapples with societal perceptions of blackness, sexuality, and Mormon teachings on race and gender roles. Her mission to Atlanta, Georgia, exposes her to systemic racism within the Mormon Church and the broader community, challenging her beliefs and sense of self.

She discusses the immense pressure she felt to be perfect and avoid any behavior considered sinful. This culminated when, at age 17, her parents discovered she had been intimate with her boyfriend and secretly sent her away to a strict religious behavioral modification camp called \u0022Lifeline\u0022 in Salt Lake City without her knowledge or consent. Becky recounts the traumatic experiences at this camp, including the rigid rules, lack of credentials among staff, and the emotional manipulation tactics. She explains how the ordeal negatively affected her self-worth and strained relationships in her life for years after. Becky emphasizes the lack of understanding about normal adolescent behavior in these religious communities, the damage caused by guilt and shame, and the need for more open, understanding parenting. She hopes that increased awareness and support for youth might prevent this from happening to others. Episode Show Notes YouTube Link \u00A0  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

      "description": "In this interview, Chelsea Goodrich details years of sexual abuse by her father, former Mormon bishop John Goodrich, beginning when she was a young child. When confronted in 2015, John admitted the abuse to both Chelsea\u0027s mother and their Mormon leaders. However, the church failed to act to protect Chelsea, support victims, or warn others. John faced excommunication but no criminal charges due to statute of limitations. In 2017, another victim came forward alleging John drugged and raped her. Despite evidence, prosecutors eventually only tried John for illegal drugging. Meanwhile, John remarried and had access to grandchildren, prompting safety concerns for Chelsea. Desperate, Chelsea and her mother sought help from church representative Paul Rytting only to be offered settlement money and asked to sign nondisclosure agreements. Ultimately, Chelsea decides to go public to protect other potential victims from a predator still left free. Her story exposes the patterns of coverups, victim blaming, inaction, and secrecy in the Mormon church around abuse.

This episode unpacks how Milton, once a celebrated entrepreneur, was unmasked as a fraud, leading to his recent sentencing of four years in prison. We explore the intricacies of his fraudulent activities at Nikola, a company that promised revolutionary electric trucks. Our special guest, Utah fraud expert Mark Pugsley, brings his insightful perspectives on the case, particularly focusing on the extent to which Milton\u0027s Mormon background and the environment he was a part of may have played a role in this story. This episode promises to shed light on the complex interplay between personal beliefs, corporate ethics, and legal accountability in the high-stakes world of business and technology.

Franke admits her actions were \u0022morally and legally wrong.\u0022 The hosts analyze how Franke justified the @buse by claiming God wanted her to discipline her son. They discuss how some Mormon teachings can distort views on \u0022morality\u0022 and discipline. The hosts argue the Mormon church needs to take some responsibility by re-examining certain teachings that may enable abuse by followers. They believe the church can help prevent similar tragedies through reforms and speaking out against domestic violence.

As Christmas approaches we take a look at the LDS Giving Machines. What do we know about how they are being utilized in terms of who is getting the goods and who gets to count the donations? As we approach the conclusion of our program, we tackle the recent land acquisitions by the LDS Church in Nebraska, exploring the motivations behind the land grab and its broader implications. Our panel discussion promises to provide diverse perspectives on the LDS Church\u0027s Mormon Monopoly of land and property over the past decade.

Lindsay Hansen Park and Bryan Buchanan guide us through the schisms, scandals and sexual dynamics of this era, from the chaotic leadership struggles in Nauvoo to the restrictive culture of polygamy in Utah. We examine how polygamy hindered missionary work and statehood, the harsh realities for women, the escalating conflicts with the US government, and the 1870s crackdown on plural marriage. Despite sympathizing with early Mormons, the hosts candidly critique problematic teachings and figures like Brigham Young. They argue that Mormonism still struggles from a reluctance to denounce past errors, which allows those harmful ideas to persist and hurt people today. This no-holds-barred journey illuminates a complex chapter of Mormon history.",

The panel dissects the influence of Harrison\u0027s teachings on individuals like Lori Vallow and others involved in extreme religious practices, shedding light on the dangerous impact of unverified spiritual claims. They also delve into the concerning associations with psychic mediums, shadow governments, and the spread of radical ideologies within certain Mormon communities, raising critical questions about the role of these beliefs in recent criminal incidents.\n Episode Show Notes\n YouTube Link\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

      "description": "Today we will discuss someone described as the \u0022spiritual leader\u0022 of alleged murders Chad Daybell and Lori Vallow, alleged abuser Tim Ballard, and recently-imprisoned Jodi Hildebrandt.\n Thom Harrison is a prominent Utah therapist who published a book called \u0022Visions of Glory\u0022 in 2012, focusing on three of his alleged near death experiences (including personal visitations from Jesus Christ). As has been uncovered over the past few years, Thom Harrison\u0027 and his book \u0022Visions of Glory\u0022 have been highly influential across the Mormon \u0022prepper\u0022 neo-fundamentalist community, and particularly in the lives and stories of Chad Daybell, Lori Vallow, Tim Ballard, Jodi Hildebrant, as well as other \u0022preppers\u0022 such as Julie Rowe, Rod Meldrum, and alleged abuser-therapist Maurice Harker.\n Part of what has made Visions of Glory so successful is that Thom (through the pseudonym Spencer) claims in his book that his visions were approved of by an un-named Mormon apostle (who now is known to be the late Neal A. Maxwell).\n Finally, we will discuss how the Mormon church was made aware of Thom Harrison and his book in the 2012-2013 time period, and chose to promote Thom to bishop instead of to punish him and/or stop the publishing of his book.\n Lauren Matthias (Hidden True Crime Podcast), Megan Connor (Lori Vallow\u0027s cousin), and Mindy Caldwell (Mormon super-sluether) will be joining us for this panel discussion.\n Episode Show Notes\n YouTube Link\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

      "description": "I have some sad and some possibly happy news to announce. First the sad news. Mormon Stories Podcast has just received today a temporary restraining order requiring us to take down our interview of Adam Paul Steed - the courageous whistleblower to Mormon church Boy Scout sexual abuse in Idaho, and one of the many victims of 8 Passengers Therapist Jodi Hildebrandt. We are not at liberty to discuss publicly the details of the restraining order at this time. For those who were not yet able to see Adam Steed\u0027s interview, in it he focused on the following: 1) His story of courageously speaking up as a victim of Mormon-church backed child abuse in its Idaho Boy Scout program, 2) How he and his father fought to successful change the statue of limitation laws for child sexual abuse victims in Idaho, 3) How he and his young family (while at BYU) were referred to therapist Jodi Hildebrandt by his Mormon bishop, 4) How (by Adam\u0027s report) Jodi Hildebrandt destroyed both his reputation and his family, through various unethical therapy practices, including violating his confidentiality by reporting false and/or confidential information to the BYU Honor Code Office, leading to his suspension from BYU. 5) How he fought back against Jodi Hildebrandt by successfully getting Jodi Hildebrandt\u0027s license suspended. And finally, 6) Adam\u0027s firm belief that the Mormon church intentionally weaponized Jodi Hildebrandt and her tactics to destroy both his life and his family, in part as retaliation for his work as a Boy Scout abuse whistleblower within the Mormon church. Because of the importance of Adam\u0027s story, we are heartbroken to have to take it down (for now). Especially after hearing from thousands of Mormons, post-Mormons, and never-Mormons who found Adam\u0027s story to be validating and/or healing. Here\u0027s the good news: this week we are actively working with a few major media outlets to: 1) Give voice to the victims of Jodi Hildebrandt, of other Mormon church-recommended \u0022sex addiction\u0022 therapists like \u0022Sons of Helaman,\u0022 \u0022Fight the New Drug,\u0022 and Lifestar, as well as and from the Mormon church\u0027s \u0022Addiction and Recovery Program\u0022 targeting its members for \u0022sex addiction.\u0022 And: 2) Hold both the Mormon church and these unethical therapists including Jodi Hildebrandt accountable for their unethical malpractice. Here\u0027s what we need from you: If you or someone you love has been harmed by either:  Jodi Hildebrandt, a Mormon church-recommended \u0022sex addiction\u0022 therapist (like Sons of Helaman or Lifestar), or \u00A0from the Mormon church\u0027s \u0022Addiction and Recovery Program\u0022 (wherein healthy, normative behaviors were pathologized as \u0022sex addiction\u0022), please email your story as soon as possible to mormonstories@gmail.com.  In your email, please include the following sections:  The date range that you worked with these people. We are particularly interested in patients recommended to Jodi Hildebrandt and others like her AFTER 2012. The names of the therapist(s) or you worked with. Any detail you can provide about who recommended you (especially if a Mormon church bishop or leader). A description of the unethical therapy practices and how they harmed you. And A confirmation of whether or not you are willing to speak with a journalist, either on the record or off the record.  Again, please email this information to mormonstories@gmail.com as soon as you are able. Finally, we promise you that at Mormon Stories Podcast, we will do everything we can to:  Restore Adam Paul Steed\u0027s Mormon story, Help you and other victims tell your stories about Jodi Hildebrandt and/or other unethical Mormon therapists, and practices, and \u00A0Help both the Mormon church and its unethical therapists and programs be held accountable for the harm that they have caused so many individuals and families.

      "description": "Adam Paul Steed, raised Mormon, was @bused as an LDS Boy Scout in Idaho.  He became a nationally known whistleblower when he turned in a dangerous pred@tor, and teamed with his father to successfully change the Idaho sexu@l @buse statute of limitations laws.  Later, Adam moved to Utah with his new wife to attend Brigham Young University.  Soon thereafter tragedy stuck when he fell into the crosshairs of Mormon therapist Jodi Hildebrandt - at the recommendation of his Mormon bishop.  Among other violations, Jodi Hildebrandt sought to paint Adam as an @buser (with no evidence), and violated Adam\u0027s client confidentiality by reporting him to the BYU Honor Code office, which led to the suspension of her therapist license around 2012.  \r\n\r\nAdam believes it possible that Jodi Hildebrandt\u0027s efforts to smear his reputation were possibly motivated by a desire to retaliate against him for his whistleblowing as a Boy Scout.\r\n\r\nOne important question we ask today - why was Elder Harold G. Hillam (Presidency of the LDS Quorum of the 70, and the President of the very same camp where Adam had been abused) deeply involved in Jodi Hildebrandt\u0027s attacks on Adam?\r\n\r\nThis is Adam\u0027s story.\n\nSend love and support to Adam here: AdamPaul0405@gmail.com\n\nEpisode Show Notes: https://www.mormonstories.org/wp-admin/post.php?post=13620\u0026action=edit\n\nChapters\n00:00:00 Introduction\n00:13:00 the video begins of recorded interview\n00:22:47 He was a victim of sexual child abuse\n00:35:30 Reporter, Peter Zuckerman and the Statute of Limitations\n01:14:50 Experiences in Life Star with Jodi Hildebrandt\n01:31:40 Jodi taught that relationships had to die before they could be reborn\n02:16:15 Jodi instructs his wife to entrap him\n03:08:12 BYU Honor Code involvement\n03:55:53 Restraining Order\n04:06:40 Adam was arrested \u0026 loses parental rights\n04:51:55 Getting Jodi\u2019s license taken away\n05:17:50 Deeper problem in Mormonism\n05:40:01 Adam\u2019s life today\n\n\n___________________\n\nAt Mormon Stories we explore, celebrate, and challenge Mormon culture through in-depth stories told by members and former members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as well as scholars, authors, LDS apologists, and other professionals.  \n\nOur overall mission is to: \n1.

      "description": "Join LatterGayStories for a black-tie art gayla! In 2014, the Mormon church stopped printing The Miracle of Forgiveness. By 2015 they began removing copies from their bookstore shelves at Deseret Book. Even though the printed version was culled, Deseret Book continued to sell digital-download copies of the book online. In 2021, LatterGayStories started the #TrashTheStash movement, encouraging its audience to remove copies of The Miracle of Forgiveness from bookshelves, home libraries, church buildings, and thrift stores. In the first year, our audience removed nearly 6,000 copies of the book, an undertaking that was documented every Thursday on the LatterGayStories Facebook and Instagram pages. https://www.eventcreate.com/e/miracle-of-forgiveness-art Now in its second year, we have collected over 8,000 copies of The Miracle of Forgiveness. On December 31, 2021, Deseret Book quietly deleted the online version of The Miracle of Forgiveness from their platform, thus ending the availability to purchase the book through official LDS sources. Reining since 1969 and selling more than 2,2 million printed and digital copies, the book is now fully discontinued. What do we do with 8,000 copies of The Miracle of Forgiveness? We turn them into art! For the second year in a row, we are inviting artists to create art pieces using reclaimed copies of The Miracle of Forgiveness. The art created from these books tell a story of the its harmful rhetoric and through the art comes healing, progress, and the ability to thrive. JOIN US! September 16, 2023 | 7:00 PM at Trolley Square in Salt Lake City, for the black tie art gala! We will have an open art exhibit displaying the art, a cocktail hour with drinks, hor d\u0027oeuvres, a short program, and a private concert featuring EJ Michels to end the evening. Dust off the formal wear and join us for an awesome night. Tickets are $35 | includes access to the exhibits, drinks, hor d\u0027oeuvres, and the concert!",

They take a brief historical journey into the realm of Mormon doubt and apologetics. We critically examine the church\u0027s framing of doubters as \u201Cunruly children\u201D and labeling doubts that lead away from the church as \u201Cevil.\u201D They discuss the reliance on the church as the sole source of authority on truth and the discouragement of critical thinking. With insights from various church authorities, this episode provides valuable perspectives on navigating doubt within the Mormon church.

      "description": "In this intriguing interview with John Dehlin and Radio Free Mormon, we delve into the contentious topic of Joseph Smith\u0027s polygamy. We start by questioning the need to discuss Smith\u0027s polygamy and encounter neo-fundamentalist Mormons asserting it was a scheme. The 1980s saw the Community of Christ church retracting their stance on Smith\u0027s polygamy. A caller on Mormonism LIVE claims Smith wasn\u0027t a polygamist, raising the pivotal question: Was he truly one? Historians unanimously agree he was.\n Examining contemporary evidence, including the Nauvoo Expositor, we see a mosaic of affidavits and records debunking theories of D\u0026C 132 being a forgery. The interview tackles apologetic tactics in the face of such evidence, uncovering the truth behind Joseph Smith\u0027s complex history. Tune in to unravel the mysteries surrounding Joseph Smith\u0027s polygamy and witness the uncovering of undeniable truths.\n Episode Show Notes\n YouTube Link\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

From the very first moment, the hosts dissect the heart of the matter: a $1.6 billion lawsuit revolving around tithing and alleged deceit. They unpack each paragraph of the ruling, illuminating how religious institutions can be held accountable for fraud outside of the protections of free speech. With a compelling mix of analysis, declarations, and analogies, this interview resonates as a thought-provoking expos\u00E9 of faith, deception, and accountability.

      "description": "Over the past several years faithful Mormon Tim Ballard has brought much attention to the topic of human trafficking via his work with Operation Underground Railroad and the new movie \u0022Sound of Freedom.\u0022 During Ballard\u0027s fundraisers he often invokes his LDS faith as the foundation for his anti-trafficking. One possible problem with Ballard\u0027s Mormon-based anti-trafficking advocacy is that the founder of his religion - Joseph Smith - would very possibly qualify by today\u0027s standards as a human trafficker. In today\u0027s episode we use The Nauvoo Expositor - published by LDS Church 1st Presidency Member William Law - as the jumping off point to explore the question: was Joseph Smith involved in human trafficking?

      "description": "In Part 2 of this eye-opening interview, Jared and Ashley Jones courageously share their experiences with child abuse within the Mormon community and the disturbing lengths to which leaders will go to protect abusers, even at the expense of victims. They recount the heart-wrenching journey that ensued after discovering sexual abuse allegations involving the teen son of a Bishopric member. Despite their efforts to seek justice and protect others, they faced resistance from church leaders who prioritized the reputation of the church and the experiences of the abuser\u0027s family over the safety and well-being of the families of his many victims time and time again. As Jared and Ashley shed light on the systemic failures and manipulations they encountered to silence and discredit them, they offer insights into the urgent need for change within the Mormon church. Don\u0027t miss this thought-provoking conversation that delves into the complexities of abuse, power dynamics, and the call for accountability.\n \n Episode Show Notes\n View on YouTube\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

      "title": "1757: Is the Mormon Church an Unhealthy Organization? w/ John Larsen",
      "description": "Sometimes we find ourselves involved in organizations, governments and communities that might be psychologically unhealthy to us or our communities. John Larsen has collected a few points you can use to check to see if an organization might be considered dangerous or unhealthy.\n  There are elections with only one candidate up for each office. All members are expected to vote in unison. The term \u201Cbeloved\u201D is applied to a living leader by other leaders of the organization. Loyal members calling for reform or change are purged or otherwise silenced. There are no means for membership to appeal a decision. The group is willing to break up families or other social structures to further or preserve its own organizations. Members are encouraged to look and dress the same. Uniformity is encouraged or required in clothing, haircuts, jewelry, etc. Life events are controlled by the organization. For example, you cannot marry without leadership approval. There is an organizationally controlled media including television, radio and newspapers. All outside media is cast as suspect. The organization is overly focused on winning over vulnerable populations such as the youth, those who are grieving, or those in financial distress. The group is involved in many business or monetary transactions wholly unrelated to the central mission of the organization. Members are encouraged or required to never say anything negative about the leadership. The organization uses litigation as a means to silence dissident membership or outside organizations speaking against the group. Community leaders are chosen by the central organization. Local communities have no say in who their representatives will be. The governance structure of the central organization is ambiguous, hidden or unknown. Obedience to the central organization is encouraged over all other values. All finances are kept secret. The leadership of the organization is preoccupied with the most intimate details of member\u2019s lives including finances, sex and personal relationships. Leadership tends to speak of the victim-hood of the organization even in endeavors where the organization has a majority or controlling influence. Organizational history is overly sentimentalized and unflattering information is edited out of official documents. The organization insists that it has primacy or is more important than all other organizations. The group has an almost obsessive focus on the outward appearances of organizational buildings and properties, grass is meticulously cut, no litter is ever found, grounds are always perfect. A great deal of time and effort is spent on this resource.  Episode Show Notes\n YouTube Link\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

She discusses the disparities in church policies and teachings that caused her to question her faith and ultimately led her down the rabbit hole of learning about the history of Mormonism. Janae talks candidly about exploring her sexuality and finding new rituals and practices to connect and uplift her after leaving the church. Her story is a powerful testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the possibilities for happiness and health after leaving a religious institution.\n Episode Show Notes\n YouTube Link\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

      "description": "In this emotional and gripping interview, Janae Thompson shares her journey as a Mormon woman and the struggles she faced in a religion that demanded perfection and conformity. From her early years in the Mormon church, to her time at BYU and beyond, Janae recounts the challenges of fitting into a narrow mold while dealing with her own personal struggles, including an eating disorder and the pressure to find an eternal companion. But it was the sudden death of her husband Grant that truly tested Janae\u2019s strength and resilience. Through her raw and honest reflections, Janae offers a powerful insight into loss, grief, and the search for meaning and purpose in the face of tragedy.\n Episode Show Notes\n YouTube Link\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

      "description": "Lance and Brandee Heppler began to question and ultimately leave the Mormon Church after their son Lake experienced mismanagement and mistreatment during his missionary training and service. This experience, along with their daughter Darby coming out as gay and being rejected by the Church, led them to start questioning Church teachings and practices. They also began to educate themselves about Church history and controversies through sources like the \u0022Mormons \u0026 Masons\u0022 documentary, \u0022Mormon Stories,\u0022 and the CES Letter.\n Further cracks in their faith emerged when Brandee became aware of a child abuse incident at their local stake center that had been covered up by Church leaders. Despite these concerns, the Hepplers continued to attend Church and pretend to believe for a time. However, they eventually reached a breaking point and decided to leave the Church altogether. They found that prioritizing their family and their own happiness outside of the Church was more important than following Church rules and teachings that were not serving them.\n Episode Show Notes\n Youtube link\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

      "description": "Join Lance and Brandee Heppler as they share their personal journeys in Mormonism and delve into mental health challenges they faced as they tried to be good Mormon parents. In this episode, Lance talks about his orthodox upbringing in Oregon, serving his mission in South Carolina, and his panic of finding someone to marry before graduating from BYU. Meanwhile, Brandee shares her struggle of not fitting in at church due in part to her parents being converts and her undiagnosed ADHD, making her wonder why it seemed God made her too \u0022rowdy\u0022 as a woman instead of more subdued and \u0022proper\u0022.\n Together they navigate the traditional gender roles expected of them as a married couple in the church while raising young children and serving in various callings. As they grapple with issues such as feminism and LGBTQ issues in the church, they also confront their own mental health struggles and the lack of support from the Mormon community. They share powerful insights about the often transactional nature of Mormon relationships and the harmful effects that come from some teachings that associate mental health struggles with sin. This episode is a must-listen for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by those raised in Mormonism and the impact it can have on mental health.\n Episode Show Notes\n Youtube link\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

      "description": "Martine and Stuart Smith are back in part three to discuss experiencing the \u201Cheavy hand\u201D of Priesthood Authority from their Stake President; from false teachings affecting lives, being told not to watch a specific show he didn\u2019t like, making youth \u201Ccovenant\u201D to go on missions and never date non-Mormons, only to see him be released and excommunicated for embezzlement. Martine had previously sympathized with the Stake President, who was sometimes unemployed and had five children. She later found out that he had put her membership status as \u201Con probation\u201D though she had never been notified as per policy, and that she had been \u201Cblacklisted\u201D from certain callings. The couple began attending Sunstone, where they explored the gray areas of life and Mormon feminism.\n During this time, they began to question the Church\u0027s teachings, including the Plan of Salvation, which involved separating families more than bringing them together. They also researched the lives of polygamous women and the Equal Rights Amendment. Stuart, an intellectual, was called into the bishopric as an unorthodox member. They stayed in the Church for its utility, but also for their son\u0027s sake. Martine became the RS Pres during the Sept Six Era, a time of more progressive leaders and scholars at BYU and at Women\u0027s Conferences and in leadership.\n Eventually the walls crack on their belief and Martine and Stuart find they can no longer stay in a church that goes against their values.\n Episode Show Notes\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

      "description": "Martine \u0026 Stuart have their first child, Nathaniel, who was diagnosed with Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB), a rare, painful, and ultimately fatal genetic skin condition. Caring for a child with EB is an immense emotional toll on them due to the constant pain the baby suffers with basic daily tasks like feeding \u0026 changing diapers. This episode delves further into the contradictions and complexities of Mormon doctrine around reproduction which made it difficult for Martine and Stuart to come to terms with Nathaniel\u0027s condition. They felt guilt and self-blame upon his diagnosis, questioning whether it was punishment for wanting to wait to have children, or due to a \u0022Saturday\u0027s Warrior\u0022 type pact agreed to in the pre-existence. The doctrine of pre-mortal decisions and the effects on disabilities was also discussed, along with the contradictory messages about disabled or sick children and those who die before accountability.\n As Nathaniel\u0027s condition worsened, the couple sought healing through priesthood blessings, but were met with disappointment when they didn\u0027t work. John discusses expectations vs. the reality of priesthood blessings and the theological justifications used when they don\u0027t work. The couple eventually came to accept the idea of letting Nathaniel go, and he passed away. Martine \u0026 Stuart describe the emotional aftermath of Nathaniel\u0027s death, including the funeral and how Mormons deal with death.\n Despite some trepidation, the couple decides to have another child, which was met with mixed reactions from their community. Martine became pregnant again and gave birth to a healthy son. They later moved to Louisiana, where they became involved in their LDS branch and had a third child, Sarah, who was also born with EB. The episode discusses the routine of care for Sarah and the support they received from their branch. The second death of an infant affected their faith, with Stuart becoming angry at God and turning down a leadership position in the church. Despite this, Martine still wanted more children, and the episode ends with the couple meeting with a General Authority to discuss the deaths of their children and birth control.\n \n\n Episode Show Notes\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

She eventually made it to the United States to attend General Conference and get her Patriarchal Blessing when her sister decided to serve a mission. Due to connections with several families of missionaries, she finds a job as a nanny and eventually makes it to BYU where she is reintroduced to Stuart, whom she\u0027d briefly met as a missionary in Belgium.\n Though he hadn\u0027t known her well, Stuart instantly recognized Martine at a Young Single Adult (YSA) activity and things took off from there until he asked her to be with him for eternity. Martine happily accepts this proposal from an established, generational Mormon returned missionary. However, the engagement is soon jeopardized by challenges between Martine\u0027s desire to follow the brethren\u0027s admonitions not to put off having children (and wanting a dozen of them!) as the quintessential Mormon housewife with Stuart\u0027s practicality regarding his ability to financially support children while still having several years of school left.\n Episode Show Notes\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

Other failed prophecies discussed include the failed treasure seeking mission to Salem and the failed attempt to sell the Book of Mormon copyright.\n Was Joseph wrong or is it was God\u0027s fault?

      "description": "Dallin Seely from YouTube channel @TheDashleys grew up as a multigenerational Mormon. When he was seven years old, his father passed away from stomach cancer. Despite this tragedy, the church provided a lot of support to him and his family. The early death of his father leads Dallin to experience intense scrupulosity as he worries that he will never see his father again in heaven if he isn\u0027t \u0022worthy\u0022 according to LDS Standards. A strict Bishop exacerbates Dallin\u2019s scrupulosity but is somewhat alleviated when a new bishop tells him that his worthiness was not determined by others. When he came home from his mission, he was encouraged to get married, but he continued to have doubts about the church\u0027s teachings, such as the priesthood ban for black members.\u00A0\n Dallin felt the Holy Ghost told him to marry a certain woman, but he falls in love with Ashley, another faithful woman but who seems a bit less \u0022proper\u0022 to Dallin for things like expressing humor through sarcasm. Dallin follows his own heart and marries Ashley anyway. The couple deals with the church\u2019s inherent sexism, including in the temple and the teaching of \u201Cthe patriarchal order\u201D in the Mormon church. Continuous marriage struggles lead them to seek therapy. This led to the healthiest time in their marriage, as they were able to have emotional intimacy and talk about their feelings, including Ashley\u0027s feelings about General Conferences and sexism. They did not want to teach their daughter to feel inferior to men. Dallin and Ashley tell how they learned to embrace their true selves and how they are raising their children in a way that eliminates guilt and fear.\u00A0\n TheDashleys on YouTube\n Ashley Dallin Films\n \n Thedashleys (@thedashleys) | TikTok\n The Dashleys (@thedashleys) \u2022 Instagram photos and videos\n Episode Show Notes\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

When she joined the Bravo show in 2019, she realized her move to quietly quit the faith would become very loud. - The New York Times\n  Heather Gay visits John and Margi in studio and brings along a familiar face for fans of Mormon Stories and The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City, Dre Robinson! Heather tells the story of how her memoir, Bad Mormon, came to be, the challenges she faced to write and publish it (and trademark it), her hopes for the future and what she and Dre are working on now.\n From the publisher:\n  Between attending orthodox services, embarking on an eighteen-month mission, attending Brigham Young University, and marrying into a \u0022royal\u0022 family, Heather was the definition of a \u0022good Mormon.\u0022 However, when the doting wife\u0027s husband unexpectedly filed for divorce, she was left out in the cold by her church and her community. In this funny, brash, and unbelievably vulnerable book, Bad Mormon recounts Heather\u0027s experiences as a single mother to three girls, navigating life post-divorce and post-Mormonism.\u0022\n  Episode Show Notes\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

He has doctorates in theology (Oxford, 2009) and sociology (Warwick, 2019). His studies of contemporary nonreligiosity have received wide international coverage, including from the BBC, New York Times, Economist, Financial Times, and Der Spiegel.\n The United States is in the midst of a religious revolution. Or, perhaps it is better to say a non-religious revolution. Around a quarter of US adults now say they have no religion. The great majority of these religious \u0022nones\u0022 also say that they used to belong to a religion but no longer do. These are the nonverts: think \u0022converts,\u0022 but from having religion to having none. There are currently has about 59 million of them in the United States.\n Nonverts explores who they are, and why they joined the rising tide of the ex-religious. One of world\u0027s leading experts on contemporary atheism and nonreligiosity, sociologist and theologian Stephen Bullivant draws on dozens of interviews, original analysis of high-quality survey data, and a wealth of cutting-edge studies, to present an entertaining and insightful exploration of America\u0027s ex-religious landscape. Bullivant criss-crosses the country, talking to everyone from ex-Mormons in Utah to ex-Catholics in Pennsylvania, from ex-Evangelicals in Georgia to ex-Muslims in California, showing not only what they have in common but also how the traditions they left behind continue to shape them.\n While American religion is not going to die out any time soon, ex-Christian America is a growing presence in national life. America\u0027s religious revolution is not just a religious revolution--it is catalyzing a profound social, cultural, moral, and political impact. Nonverts will serve as an indispensable guide to this shifting landscape, as well as the future of American life.\n Join John and Nemo as they dive deeper into just why it is that people leave the LDS church.\n Nonverts: The Making of Ex-Christian America\n Episode Show Notes\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

This will be a 3-part series of Channel\u2019s story.\n Channel is continuing her story from her marriage, an embarrassing disciplinary council where she is judged for her \u201Csins\u201D by a group entirely of white men, and dealing with the fall-out of a marriage that was ill-suited from the beginning and facing the stigma of divorce within the LDS church as a woman of color. Channel marries again, this time to a non-member of the church and has two children. Despite her husband\u2019s encouragement to leave, Channel continues to seek acceptance and approval from her religion despite her skin color. As she becomes disillusioned over time, Channel manages to stay in because of the influence of a few good friends, especially when her second marriage dissolves, and she finds herself needing more help.\n We learn more about issues around race issues in general such as the difference between racism and white supremacy and how both show up in the Church\u2019s doctrines, practices, and members, including being constantly talked down to and told what to do with her life and what to think even by friends over a decade younger than she.\n Episode Show Notes\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

This will be a 3-part series of Channel\u2019s story.\n In Part 1 We get some background on Channel\u2019s family growing up, how black families and black culture differ substantially from Mormon white culture, what led Channel to seek God and how that led to her joining the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Channel tells us the good, bad \u0026 ugly of how she was treated as a black teenage convert, when she learned of the Church\u2019s racism, and ways that she accepted, excused, and eventually internalized it to see herself as \u201Cless\u201D than her white counterparts.\n This became most apparent in dating and marriage. While white men in the church may find her exotic and are willing to date her, Channel finds that they are unwilling to marry her as \u201Cmixing seed\u201D would pass her \u201Ccurse\u201D [black skin] to children that could otherwise have two white parents. As Channel loses herself and what makes her unique to the cultural expectations of the Church she marries another black member of the church at the counsel of her Bishop against her better judgment.\n Episode Show Notes\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

Driven by a desire to do what\u2019s right and excel, Kelsey develops a perfectionism that goes beyond religious adherence into body image and leads to disordered eating. Kelsey is able to recover with help from her parents, only to be thrown into another family crisis as her father succumbs to an opiate addiction after chronic back pain and leaves both the Church and the family. As many children do, Kelsey feels she shares blame for the destruction of her family and re-commits to the LDS religion for strength and comfort.\u00A0\n When her family moves to Provo, Utah, Mormon purity culture has costs for Kelsey\u2019s self-esteem and body image as she continues pursuing performance at high school and BYU. Kelsey\u2019s first doubts come as she serves a mission in Birmingham Alabama and grapples with the spirituality and fulfillment members of other faiths feel. Kelsey realizes belief in \u201Ceternal families\u201D is far from unique to Mormonism but what IS unique about the Mormon version is the dark element that it\u2019s predicated on a God deliberately separating families first.\n\nJoin us for the rest in Part 2!\n Social Media:\n  New Song: Life in a Box Insta: www.instagram.com/kelseymarieedwards TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@kelseymarieedwards YouTube.com/@kelseyedwards Kelsey Edwards on IMDB  Squad Goals: Courses.kelseyedwards.co (For teen girls about making/keeping good friends)\u00A0\n Episode Show Notes\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

Over the course of succeeding decades, this practice became more severe, constituting a wrenching removal from the community. Gaining readmittance often required intense penance and evidence of significant change stretching over a prolonged period of time. Sometimes this process even involved the leaders\u0027 colleagues.

      "description": "When Douglas Stilgoe, AKA \u0022Nemo the Mormon\u0022 on YouTube, no longer felt he could publicly sustain Mormonism\u0027s top leadership of apostles \u0026 prophets due to multiple acts of demonstrable dishonesty, he lost one of Mormonism\u0027s highest privileges: the ability to attend the Temple.\n For Mormons, Temple worship goes FAR beyond religious ceremony. It is the gate by which believing Mormons qualify for Exaltation, the highest level of Heaven \u0026 privilege in the after-life according to Mormon theology, and by which marriages \u0026 family relationships are \u0022sealed\u0022 together for eternity. Thus, losing the privilege of Temple worship doesn\u0027t just risk an individual\u0027s OWN eternal reward, but also puts one\u0027s eternal marriage and other family ties in jeopardy, some even to the extent of believing that faithful spouses and children will be \u0022reassigned\u0022 to a faithful stranger who will replace the unbelieving spouse or parent in Heaven.\n It is also synonymous with personal \u0022worthiness\u0022, so any Mormons not permitted inside are often thought to be committing or in the process of repenting from egregious sins, such as adultery. Mormons who are not considered \u0022worthy\u0022 to perform Temple ordinances themselves are also barred from even attending ordinances - like weddings - of any friends and family that take place there, another significant source of pain and alienation for some.\n Naturally, Doug found it problematic that for believing Mormons, such important things as Exaltation and Eternal Family can be held hostage and denied for something as simple as refusing to agree to sustain leaders who, by virtue of a supposedly secret ordinance known as the \u0022Second Anointing,\u0022 are exempt from any accountability towards members of the Church, even for bold, deliberate acts of harm and dishonesty.\n ...or are they?\n This episode documents attempts made by Doug (Nemo) to get to the bottom of whether Mormon doctrines \u0026 practices meant to instill accountability from its earliest days and scripture are still applicable today, or whether they\u0027ve become mere ritual, devoid of any meaningful significance other than virtue-signaling conformity and a continued commitment to blind obedience. As a squeaky wheel unable to be assuaged or silenced by local leadership, Nemo surprises everyone (including himself) when he manages to bypass the usual gatekeepers and break through the glass ceiling separating Mormonism\u0027s apostles and prophets from the rank-and-file, successfully garnering the attention of none other than second highest-ranking apostle and next in line to become prophet, Dallin H. Oaks.\n How did it go? Tune it to find out!\n Nemo the Mormon YouTube Channel\n  \u0022Evidence of Dishonesty\u0022 - Nemo\u0027s document (coming soon!)

      "description": "Join us for two unique Mormon Stories as John Dehlin \u0026 Samantha Shelley interview Tommy \u0026 Madison Johnson. Tommy made fans and haters on both sides of belief when he hit the TikTok scene during COVID with funny skits on the peculiarities of Mormonism. What viewers couldn\u0027t see was that Tommy was struggling to know how to deal with many of the messier topics in Church History as well as the darker sides of modern Mormon doctrines such as the stance against the LGBTQ\u002B community, which includes his own sister, while ALSO navigating his mixed-faith marriage with Madison who stopped believing entirely after their Temple Marriage. Madison describes her life as having been \u0022born into a faith crisis\u0022 due to stigma and family shame around being conceived out of wedlock by a teen mother. Madison\u0027s struggles with the faith continued through most of her life despite her levels of activity/involvement in the Church, even through her Temple Marriage with Tom. Madison leaves the Church upon finding the CES letter and she and Tommy work through what this will mean for their marriage, and even end up on an episode of the podcast \u0022Marriage on a Tightrope\u0022 with Katie \u0026 Allan Mount. They finish off with where the couple is at today and how life is going since all of the changes they\u0027ve been through.

The doctrinal basis for the early Mormon ban against black people worshiping and marrying in the Temple, as well as the ban against black Mormon men from receiving the Priesthood, the authority needed to hold any leadership position in the Church as well as perform essential saving ordinances such as baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost etc. The real reasons the Church was pressured to lift the ban and the measures taken to make it happen despite continued vehement opposition among some Church leaders.  1665: Race \u0026 Mormon Scripture Pt 2 w/ LDS Discussions \u2013 22\n LDS Discussions Essay on Race\n Episode Show Notes\n  _________________________\n LDS Discussions is made possible by generous donors!\n Help us continue to deliver quality content by becoming a donor today:\n  One-time or recurring donation through Donorbox Support us on Patreon Pick \u201CMormon Stories\u201D as your charity on Amazon Smile or through the Amazon App  LDS Discussions Platforms:\n  LDS Discussions Website LDS Discussions Playlist on YouTube  Contact LDS Discussions:\n  Twitter: @ldsdicussions Facebook: @ldsdiscussion Insta: @ldsdiscussions Email: ldsdiscussions@gmail.com  Contact us:\n MormonStories@gmail.com\n PO Box 171085, Salt Lake City, UT 84117\n Social Media:\n  Insta: @mormstories Tiktok: @mormonstoriespodcast Join the Discord",

In this series, Greg shares with us many fascinating stories about his experiences with his grandfather including:\n  The tendency of LDS church members to overly worship General Authorities, along with the unhealthy obsession some Mormons have with \u0022access\u0022 to General Authorities. The undying love Elder Wirthlin had for his wife (Elisa), his family, and for football. The extent to which nepotism, cronyism, and patronage play a part in the selection of LDS church General Authorities. The downsides/sacrifices of being an LDS church Apostle/General Authority. The existence of divisions and \u0022cliques\u0022 in the LDS church quorum of the 12 Apostles. The unhealthy pressures and expectations put on the children and grandchildren of LDS General Authorities, that often lead to a familial emphasis on \u0022public appearance\u0022 over healthy relationships. The \u0022code\u0022 that exists within families of LDS General Authorities to never do or say anything to bring dishonor to the family name or church, including speaking out about a loss of faith, which leads many descendants of LDS apostles to lie about and/or hide their loss of faith.

Gospel Tangents is a channel looking to represent a 360 degree view of Mormonism and welcomes guests representing various views and experiences of the Restoration Gospel started by Joseph Smith.\u00A0\n Rick calls John Dehlin the \u0022grandfather\u0022 of Mormon podcasting. Not that he\u0027s old, but rather internet-old! Rick asks John about his journey in and out of the Church, dating an Oscar-winning actress in high school, some of his dealing with general authorities, and his excommunication and aftermath. They also discuss his tangles with apologists \u0026 neo-apologists, the Swedish Rescue, and whether he really wants people to stay LDS.\n \n\n ________\n WE ARE 100% DONOR FUNDED!

      "description": "The Mormon Church has struggled with the engraved racist passages in its most holy book of scripture such as the divine curse that came upon the Lamanites turning them into loathsome people with a skin of blackness. Anthropologist Dr. Thomas Murphy joined John and Gerardo to discuss racism in The Book of Mormon and how Joseph Smith stole native culture, mixed it with racist ideas of his time, published it, and sold it as theirs. We also discuss how these racist ideas contained in the Book of Mormon have transcended into modern Mormon Culture and beliefs.\n ________\n WE ARE 100% DONOR FUNDED!

      "description": "Join John as he interviews Utah Representative Angela Romero, Lindsey Lundholm, and Dr. Julie Hanks about the upcoming Protect Kids rally, in favor of requiring clergy to report abuse.\n ALL adults across the state, without exception, should be mandated to report child abuse. Representative Angela Romero has championed this legislation over the past two years. She is sponsoring the rally and will be the keynote speaker. Lindsey Lundholm is the grassroots organizer for the Protect Kids rally, and passionate about giving children one more safe line of defense against abuse. As a therapist and member of the LDS faith, Dr. Julie Hanks, stands in support of eliminating the clergy loophole. Please join us at the south steps of the Utah State Capitol this Friday @ 6:30pm. WEAR TEAL in support of SA survivors.\n More details here: https://fb.me/e/2G8FC1foR\n For those unable to attend in person, the event will be streamed live. In case of inclement weather, the event will be held fully online via Facebook live at 6:30pm on Friday, August 19th. Currently in Utah law, clergy are exempt from mandatory reporting of child abuse. Recent news stories have highlighted how this exception can lead to serious harm for children, and a grey area for clergy.\n Let\u2019s make the law clear: protecting children from abuse is the first priority. We are rallying to educate and encourage the state to pass laws that close the clergy loophole. We believe this is the year we can get it passed, to provide a safer Utah for children.\n How you can help in the meantime:\n \uD83D\uDD39 RSVP to the Facebook event, and invite your circle of influence: https://fb.me/e/2G8FC1foR\n \uD83D\uDD39 Follow, like, and share on Instagram @mandateclergyreporting\n \uD83D\uDD39 Sign this petition (40k\u002B signatures): Make LDS Clergy Mandatory Reporters: https://chng.it/6DvQJS5rLF\n \uD83D\uDD39 DM or email us at mandateclergyreporting@gmail.com to lend support, offer to volunteer, etc.\n \uD83D\uDD39 Share your story. If you would like to express how you or a loved one has been impacted by the clergy exemption, please follow this link for more details:\n * Find your representative link: https://le.utah.gov/GIS/findDistrict.jsp https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1n4Ai...",

      "description": "Join us as we welcome Jessica Parker to the Thrive Stories podcast to discuss her journey of accepting and finding peace in infertility. As a woman who was raised in a faithful Latter-day Saint home, Jessica absorbed all the messages about the role of women and her divine purpose to bear children. She served a mission, got married in the temple, and gave her time and energy to the church for years. All of this came into question when Jessica began her faith journey--which then led to deconstructing and rebuilding her innate sense of value, identity, and purpose as a human being.\n Thrive Stories is a podcast series where Margi (alongside John or Jenn) interviews a member of the community once per month. The interviews are shorter (2-3 hours), story-based, and are focused on a particular aspect of healing and growth AFTER a Mormon faith crisis (thus the THRIVE name). They generally happen on Tuesdays at noon (MST). Some examples of areas of thriving include: Family Relationships, Healthy Boundaries, Finding Community, Finding Meaning/Purpose, Dealing with Grief/Death, Religion after Mormonism, Health Sexuality, Parenting, Improving Physical Health, Identity, Health Marriage/Relationships, Secular Spirituality, Word of Wisdom 2.0, and Women Finding Their Own Voice after Mormonism.\n If you would like to nominate someone you know who would be a great candidate for a THRIVE interview, please nominate them (or yourself) here.\n WE ARE 100% DONOR FUNDED!

      "description": "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is known globally for its massive missionary force. Over the past year we have received several independent reports suggesting serious distress in the Mormon missionary program, including:\n  A sharp decline in the number of LDS missionaries overall. A sharp decline in the number of young men willing to serve missions. A significant increase in the number of LDS missionaries returning home early. Troubling new rhetoric/teachings from Mormon church leadership suggesting (out of seeming desperation) that Mormon missionary service for young men is mandatory/compulsory.  On Thursday at 4pm (mountain) we will be exploring this issue. If you have any data or stories regarding these (or other) developments regarding Mormon missionary work, please post them as comments below, or email us at: mormonstories@gmail.com and we can include your input in the show (anonymously if requested).

In this episode, we discuss how Ari lost her faith in the church when she realized that it, too was rooted in abuse and lies, and set on excommunicating those who spoke out against those things. In her discovery, she concluded that the church creates toxic family systems and even abuse cycles.

Just when Linda Barney thought she had the perfect life planned for her family, she discovered that letting her kids be exactly who they are and loving them unconditionally was a far happier and healthier path to follow than the one she had always been taught to believe in. Join us for this compelling Thrive Stories episode about Parenting LGBTQIA children.\n \u00A0\n Thrive Stories is a new podcast series where Margi (alongside John or Jenn) will be interviewing a member of the community twice per month.\u00A0 The interviews will be shorter (1-2 hours), story-based, but will be focused on a particular aspect of healing and growth AFTER a Mormon faith crisis (thus the THRIVE name).\u00A0 They will happen on Tuesdays at noon (MST). Some examples of areas of thriving include:\u00A0 Family Relationships, Healthy Boundaries, Finding Community, Finding Meaning/Purpose, Dealing with Grief/Death, Religion after Mormonism, Health Sexuality, Parenting, Improving Physical Health, Identity, Health Marriage/Relationships, Secular Spirituality, Word of Wisdom 2.0, and Women Finding Their Own Voice after Mormonism.\n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n WE ARE 100% DONOR FUNDED!

      "description": "Christine Carol Robinson Burton is the niece of the late Mormon prophet Gordon B. Hinckley, and the daughter of Oliver Preston Robinson and Christine Hinckley Robinson.\u00A0 Christine\u0027s father, Preston or \u0022Pres\u0022 was a prominent professor of advertising a the University of Utah, general manager of the Deseret News Publishing Company and editor of the Deseret News, and a personal mentor to the late Mormon prophet Thomas S. Monson.\u00A0 Preston was mentioned seven different times in the LDS Church-approved biography of Thomas S. Monson.\n In Christine\u0027s heartbreaking and inspiring story, she relates several tragic Mormon-related stories, including:\n  Experiencing psychological, physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her parents. Feeling deep confusion trying to reconcile her parents\u0027 abuse with her own self-worth, given that her parents/family were publicly lauded on multiple occasions by several Mormon prophets as being exemplary.\u00A0 This included her father being called as mission president in England, and both of her parents receiving their Second Anointing after the abuse. Her attempts to tell both Gordon B. Hinckley and Thomas S. Monson (as sitting prophets/apostles) about the abuse she experienced at the hands of her parents - wherein she was told by both that she needed to \u0022put it behind her.\u0022 The death by suicide of her gay son. Her loss of Mormon faith. Her commitment to helping others heal and grow after Mormonism.  We hope you find value in this heartbreaking and inspiring episode.\n Show Notes:\n  O.

With audio recordings of phone calls, meetings, and the Disciplinary Council itself, we will show the constant misrepresentations, deflections, and gaslighting perpetrated by the Bishop and the Stake President to protect the good name of the church. A modern case of lying for the Lord. After moving out of his home-Stake, not attending church for 4 years, and 6 months after posting on Facebook about getting married to the love of his life, Brennen was handed a letter at his door. He was utterly stunned and confused as he read the document signed by his childhood bishop who was summoning him to a Disciplinary Council on the basis of his same-sex marriage. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 We are 100% donor funded!

      "description": "Teal Swan is a highly controversial New Age guru with millions of online followers.\u00A0 Teal specifically markets her services to vulnerable, often suicidal individuals, and advances highly controversial and/or damaging beliefs and techniques including:\n  Encouraging graphic suicidal ideation. Nurturing false memories and false accusations of ritual abuse by family members through thoroughly debunked recovered memory techniques. Waterboarding as a trauma treatment. Downplaying the severity of death by suicide by likening it to \u201Chitting the reset button\u201D into a future reincarnated life.  Teal\u2019s practices are covered more thoroughly in the recently released Hulu series entitled \u201CThe Deep End.\u201D Several deaths by suicide have been attributed to Teal\u2019s practices.\n In today\u2019s episode we interview Diana Hansen Ribera, who was one of Teal\u2019s closest childhood and adolescent friends.\u00A0 In her interview, Diana provides thorough detail to challenge Teal\u2019s false claims of being a victim of satanic ritual abuse and sex trafficking as a child, and explains how Teal developed her coercion skills and harmful techniques with Diana \u2014 that Teal would eventually employ on a broader scale.\n Warning: This interview contains graphic and disturbing content.\u00A0 Viewer and listener discretion is advised.\n Show Notes:\n  Zelph on the Shelf YT channel  Zelph on the Shelf MS episode  The Deep End Hulu Series  MS Satanic Ritual Abuse episode Jared Dobson MS episode  The Gateway podcast episode on Teal BBC Episode on Teal Teal\u2019s interview by Idaho journalist Girl, Interrupted movie  You\u2019re Wrong About podcast Human trafficking episode  Remembering Satan Book Diana\u0027s Email: DianaTellsHerTruth@gmail.com  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n We are 100% donor funded!

      "description": "Join Margi and John for our next episode of Thrive Stories tomorrow, Tuesday May 24th, at noon (MST). Marc Oslund will be joining us in the studio! Marc spent most of his young adult life and the entirety of his time in the Mormon church trying to fit in. After converting to Mormonism, Marc\u2019s tendency to be hard on himself grew into scrupulosity--a form of religious OCD that made his self-worth plummet. Marc began to believe that he was never good enough--a belief that took a steep toll on his mental health. After years of suffering, Marc acquired skills that aligned with principles of innate worth, shame resilience, mindfulness, self-compassion that allowed him to overcome his scrupulosity. This episode conveys Marc\u2019s experience ending the hustle to find worth and the lessons learned in the process of coming home to himself.\n Disclaimer: although Marc is a mental health professional and therapeutic principles are conveyed in this episode, this not meant to be considered mental health treatment or professional advice.\n Thrive Stories is a new podcast series where Margi (alongside John or Jenn) will be interviewing a member of the community twice per month. The interviews will be shorter (1-2 hours), story-based, but will be focused on a particular aspect of healing and growth AFTER a Mormon faith crisis (thus the THRIVE name). They will happen on Tuesdays at noon (MST). Some examples of areas of thriving include: Family Relationships, Healthy Boundaries, Finding Community, Finding Meaning/Purpose, Dealing with Grief/Death, Religion after Mormonism, Health Sexuality, Parenting, Improving Physical Health, Identity, Health Marriage/Relationships, Secular Spirituality, Word of Wisdom 2.0, and Women Finding Their Own Voice after Mormonism.

      "description": "Join Margi and John for our next episode of Thrive Stories this coming Tuesday at noon (MST). Come listen and participate in the conversation as we talk to Holly Ashton Wallin. Holly will talk about the role of passion in her life, beginning as a young girl where she was a dreamer, a lover and a fighter. She will take us through how she lost herself along the way--and with that, her passion. Holly eventually came to experience the loss of her marriage, her faith, her career path, and her health. Witness how Holly rebuilt her identity and her life after loss by connecting back to that fire within. What does it mean to live \u201Ca life on fire?\u201D Join us to find out!\n Thrive Stories is a new podcast series where Margi (alongside John or Jenn) will be interviewing a member of the community twice per month. The interviews will be shorter (1-2 hours), story-based, but will be focused on a particular aspect of healing and growth AFTER a Mormon faith crisis (thus the THRIVE name). They will happen on Tuesdays at noon (MST). Some examples of areas of thriving include: Family Relationships, Healthy Boundaries, Finding Community, Finding Meaning/Purpose, Dealing with Grief/Death, Religion after Mormonism, Health Sexuality, Parenting, Improving Physical Health, Identity, Health Marriage/Relationships, Secular Spirituality, Word of Wisdom 2.0, and Women Finding Their Own Voice after Mormonism.\n If you would like to nominate someone you know who would be a great candidate for a THRIVE interview, please nominate them (or yourself) here.\n Show Notes:\n  John Gottman - Marriage book- The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work Getting the Love You Want: A Guide for Couples: Third Edition Esther Perel - The State of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity Brene Brown - Braving the Wilderness A New Earth - Eckhart Tolle Falling upward by Richard Rohr Mormon Stories Thrive interview with Dave  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n We are 100% donor funded!

      "description": "Since the founding of Mormonism in 1830 there has been a core belief in the imminent 2nd coming of Jesus Christ (thus the \u0022Latter-day Saints\u0022 portion of the Mormon church\u0027s official name). Within modern Mormonism over the past few decades there has been an increasing trend towards \u0022end times\u0022 preparedness - wherein ultra-orthodox Mormons begin preparing for the 2nd coming of Jesus by selling their 401k\u0027s and retirement plans, moving to rural areas, attending \u0022Prepper\u0022 conferences like \u0022Preparing a People,\u0022 building fortresses, stockpiling food/weapons/ammunition/tents/trailers, denying traditional health care to children, etc., and preparing (i.e., \u0022prepping\u0022) for the arrival of Jesus. This movement has been at best benign (for a few), but for many has led to extreme behaviors, divided families, financial ruin, a host of emerging \u0022prophets\u0022 (e.g., charlatans) who prey on this mentality (e.g., Julie Rowe), and in some cases murder (e.g., Chad Daybell and Lori Vallow story).\n Emma was raised in a Mormon Prepper household. In Part 3 of our 3-part series with Emma, she discusses \u0022coming out\u0022 as lesbian while as BYU student, and how her emerging LGBTQ identity, along with family rejection and problems with her family\u0027s \u0022Prepper\u0022 beliefs, led her to lose faith in the Mormon church, and to become alienated from her orthodox Mormon family.\n Show Notes:\n  \u0022LGBTQ students at BYU light up the \u0027Y\u0027 in rainbow colors,\u0022 by Courtney Tanner, Salt Lake Tribune, March 5, 2021 \u0022A Bishop\u0027s Family Questions Mormonism,\u0022 Kelly and Kayla Mikesell on Mormon Stories Cultish podcast \u0022Coming Out as a Non-Believer to Family Members,\u0022 Gift of the Mormon Faith Crisis Encircle: Utah Resources for LGBTQ\u002B Youth \u0022Elder Jeffrey R.

Come listen and participate in the conversation as we talk to Jake Bellenfant. Find out how Jake has processed the damaging experiences of his youth and young adulthood growing up gay in the church and how he has reclaimed his own mental health. In addition, listen to how Jake has navigated grief and loss in witnessing both the death of his mother and the loss of his community. Jake is now a mental health advocate, studying at the #1 ranked Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner program at Vanderbilt University. He aspires to improve the mental health of populations across the lifespan and in marginalized groups that are struggling with mental illness-- particularly those who have suffered the mental health effects of undue influence, high demand belief systems, abusive family dynamics, and religious trauma.\n Thrive Stories is a new podcast series where Margi (alongside John and Carah) will be interviewing a member of the community twice per month. The interviews will be shorter (1-2 hours), story-based, but will be focused on a particular aspect of healing and growth AFTER a Mormon faith crisis (thus the THRIVE name). They will happen on Tuesdays at noon (MST). Some examples of areas of thriving include: Family Relationships, Healthy Boundaries, Finding Community, Finding Meaning/Purpose, Dealing with Grief/Death, Religion after Mormonism, Health Sexuality, Parenting, Improving Physical Health, Identity, Health Marriage/Relationships, Secular Spirituality, Word of Wisdom 2.0, and Women Finding Their Own Voice after Mormonism.\n If you would like to nominate someone you know who would be a great candidate for a THRIVE interview, please nominate them (or yourself) HERE.\n Show Notes:\n  THRIVE story application form link Prop 8 Podcast (icarly) Jennette McCurdy Empty Inside Podcast  Kolby Sorensen MS Episode Combating Cult Mind Control Steven Hassan website Mind Over Mood Utah Crisis Line Mindfulness Meditation Steven Hassan - Influence Continuum Podcast Recovering Agency Documentaries on cult control and mental control:  Bad Vegan - Netflix Wild Wild Country - Netflix The Matrix - HBO Max, Peacock TV \u0026 Redbox Pleasantville - Prime Video, Vudu Movie \u0026 TV Store, Redbox., Apple TV Tangled - Disney \u002B Holy Hell - Amazon Prime The Invention of Lying - Prime Video, Vudu Movie \u0026 TV Store, VUDU, Apple TV or Redbox Smallfoot - Prime Video, VUDU, Vudu Movie \u0026 TV Store or Redbox The Vow - Hulu    \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n We are 100% donor funded!

We dive in head-on in this episode hearing about how marriage for these two young Mormons was not what they expected. But with an interesting reframe to spirituality from an LDS therapist, Lizzy and Spencer\u2019s autonomous spirituality began to emerge like never before. After having enough of spiritual gatekeeping and finding a way to make marriage finally work from them, Spencer describes almost being kicked out of BYU and the situation he was put in by a bishop telling him he had one week to read the Book of Mormon or lose his ecclesiastical endorsement. There are too many topics to list that we cover in this epic final episode with Lizzy and Spencer, but among them are: How and why some Mormons decide to supplement LDS church teachings with New Age spirituality, how wearing garments and Mormon body standards affect women, how empathizing with friends in the LGBTQ community can wake a person up to the realities and harms of Mormon doctrine, and so many other great insights and analogies that help describe why a couple would love Mormonism and choose to leave it!\n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n We are 100% donor funded!

      "description": "Recently John Dehlin had lunch with a mid-level Mormon church leader along the Wasatch front who was eager to share insider information regarding the statistical and programmatic health of the Mormon church since the COVID-19 epidemic. \u00A0 Topics that were covered include: - The pervasiveness of \u0022faith crisis\u0022 issues within Mormon stakes and wards.\n  The rise of conservative/fundamentalist/\u0022Prepper\u0022/\u0022Trumpers\u0022/anti-vaxxers/Q-Anoners as a source of disaffection from the Mormon church. Attempts to increase the involvement of women. How post-COVID Mormon apathy has led to a decline in church activity. The rise of \u0022PIMO\u0022 Mormons (Physically in, mentally out). The decline of the Mormon youth programs, with a dramatic decline in young men church participation and mission service.  The leader was willing to share activity statistics within his stake to demonstrate the post-COVID decline.\n Finally, the source was willing to share information regarding three significant changes at Mormon church headquarters:\n  The dramatic rise in temple building since Russel M. Nelson became the Mormon prophet, and the effect this is having on the temple department. A new Mormon temple prep course that will soon be released. Significant upcoming changes regarding 1 on 1 youth interviews.

Our Mormon Stories inbox had an influx of incensed Latter-day Saints across all spectrums of belief last night as Brad Wilcox gave a fireside talk that we\u2019re calling \u201CThe Alpine Utah Mormon Youth Rescue\u201D. Just like the LDS church\u2019s response to the wave of apostasy in 2012 affecting Swedish members, Brad Wilcox, professor of ancient scripture at BYU and second counselor in the Young Men general presidency spoke to the youth February 6th, 2022 in a talk about how leaving the Mormon church means \u201Cyou lose everything that matters\u201D. Join John, Gerardo, and Carah as we play clips and react to Brad explaining his reasons to the youth of the church that those who leave the faith are taking the hardest possible route in life. Other quotes include:\u00A0\n \u0022Maybe instead of asking \u0027why did the blacks have to wait until 1978\u2019, maybe what we should be asking is \u0027why did the whites and other races have to wait until 1829?\u2019\u0022\n \u201CWe are the only Christians in the world led by Christ\u201D\n \u0022When you walk away from this church you lose everything that matters in your life.\u201D\n \n\n Show Notes:\n View our playlist with the full talk on our Understanding Mormonism channel.\u00A0 Individual sections are included below.\u00A0 To download the raw video file click here.\n Grant Palmer\u2019s books\n \u00A0\n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n We are 100% donor funded!

      "description": "Mormon Stories Listeners/Viewers,\n We are SUPER excited to announce a new project on Mormon Stories Podcast, based on your feedback. Some background: we asked you (the community) for feedback regarding Margi Dehlin\u0027s participation on Mormon Stories, and the feedback we received was that you would value having Margi actually occasionally interview people for Mormon Stories Podcast (with John and Carah supporting of course) - but to still draw on Margi\u0027s wisdom/expertise as a coach.\n So here\u0027s the new project: For the next few months, Margi will be interviewing a member of the community twice per month. The interviews will be shorter (1-2 hours), still story-based, but will be focused on a particular aspect of healing and growth AFTER a Mormon faith crisis (thus the THRIVE name). Some examples of categories include: Family Relationships, Healthy Boundaries, Finding Community, Finding Meaning/Purpose, Dealing with Grief/Death, Religion after Mormonism, Health Sexuality, Parenting, Improving Physical Health, Identity, Health Marriage/Relationships, Secular Spirituality, Word of Wisdom 2.0, and Women Finding Their Own Voice after Mormonism.\n We have set up a form for you to nominate someone who you think would be amazing for Mormon Stories Podcast, or to nominate yourself. If you or someone you know would be a great candidate for a THRIVE interview, please nominate them (or yourself) here.\u00A0 The form gives you the option to upload a video of you or your nominee telling a story.\n Margi will be sifting through these interviews and will reach out to you if you are chosen. Please spread the word! And thank you for the support!!!! Also, feel free to email Margi Dehlin with any questions: margidehlin@gmail.com\n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n We are 100% donor funded!

Mark is a clinical and counseling psychologist by profession who has spent part of his career working in LDS Family Services and was first inspired on his mission as a trainer to become a psychologist when working with difficult companions. Zelle discusses with us what it was like as a missionary during Covid, coming home early, coming out to her family, and coming into her own authentic self. A few of the themes we cover in this episode are around how growing up in the US Midwest and South shapes Mormon experiences, focusing on what\u2019s inside instead of outside appearances, and coming to terms with Mormon truth claims as a family.

      "description": "Join John Dehlin and Radio Free Mormon as we speak with Dan Vogel about his new book, \u201C Book of Abraham Apologetics: A Review and Critique\u201D published by Signature Books.\n Said to have been dictated by Joseph Smith as a translation of an ancient Egyptian scroll purchased in Kirtland, Ohio, in 1835, the Book of Abraham may be Mormonism\u2019s most controversial scripture. Decades of impassioned discussion began when about a dozen fragments of Smith\u2019s Egyptian papyri, including a facsimile from the Book of Abraham, were found in the New York Metropolitan Museum in 1966. The discovery solved a mystery about the origin of the Egyptian characters that appear in the various manuscript copies of the Book of Abraham from 1835, reproduced from one of the fragments. Some LDS scholars devised arguments to explain what seemed to be clear evidence of Smith\u2019s inability to translate Egyptian. In this book, Dan Vogel not only highlights the problems with these apologetic arguments but explains the underlying source documents in revealing detail and clarity.\n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n We are 100% donor funded!

Growing up with enormous health challenges, Nate recognized feelings of same-sex attraction early on in their childhood.\n We discuss Nate\u2019s staunch commitment to the Mormon faith, anorexia while serving a mission, and Nate\u2019s decision to confide in a bishop about their feelings for men, leading Nate to a house and a therapist that would change the course of their life.\n Please practice self-care as you listen to this episode as we highlight the unfortunate reality that the practice of conversion therapy and torture to change the sexual orientation of gay Mormons continues still today.\n **Trigger warning on this episode***\n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n We are 100% donor funded!

We discuss the similarities between NXIVM leader Keith Raniere and Joseph Smith, including secret societies existing within the larger group, and the similar tactics used to control so many people.\n\nSarah and Nippy share which vulnerabilities led them to become involved in NXIVM and once they were in, what tactics were used to get them to ignore red flags and their own instincts, even as far as Sarah allowing herself to be \u201Cbranded\u201D with Keith Raniere\u2019s initials on her skin. How does one \u201Cwake up\u201D after being willing to go so far?\n Sarah and Nippy share their paths to regaining control of their own minds and bodies to face the hard truth about what they used to believe\u2013and how they turn that devastation into a united determination to expose Keith for what he really is to the world. We hope you\u2019ll resonate with Sarah and Nippy\u2019s fascinating and gripping story!\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

      "description": "What happens when two closeted lesbian Mormon women marry men, have children, then cross paths and fall in love? In this very special Mormon Stories 2 part episode, we are honored to share one of the most important interviews in the history of the podcast. This is the story of Lena Schwen and Sal Osborne. In part 1, Sal describes dating in high school, feeling as though part of her died as she married a man in the LDS temple, and struggling with her ex-husband and band mate as they toured in the group \u201CLove You Long Time\u201D. Lena, a teenage convert from a divorced Catholtic Italian home, takes us through the heartbreaking events that led to her conversion into the LDS church.

In 1844 he claimed to have been appointed to be the successor of Joseph Smith as leader of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite),[a] a faction of the Latter Day Saint movement. Strang testified that he had possession of a letter from Smith naming him as his successor, and furthermore reported that he had been ordained to the prophetic office by an angel. His organization is claimed by his followers to be the sole legitimate continuation of the Church of Christ founded by Joseph Smith fourteen years before.

      "description": "As Chad Daybell and Lori Vallow face indictments and/or allegations for multiple murders (e.g., Chad\u0027s wife Tammy, Lori\u0027s husband Charles, Lori\u0027s brother Alex, Lori\u0027s children JJ and Tylee) - many believing LDS church members (i.e. \u0022Mormons\u0022) have taken issue with the suggestion that Mormon beliefs played any role in these murders.\n Today we begin Part 1 in a series exploring the Mormon influences on Chad Daybell and Lori Vallow.\u00A0 Our guests for today are Lauren and John Matthias - co-hosts of the Hidden True Crime podcast.\u00A0 I am also super happy to be joined today by my dear, brilliant friend Mindy Caldwell, who has followed the Daybell/Vallow case very closely over the past few years.\n Please join us with your questions and comments.\n Hidden: A True Crime Podcast explores the hidden motives behind unimaginable crimes, while examining our deepest fears along the way. Join us on a journey into the darkest recesses of the human mind and the unconscious motivations that drive human behaviors, both good and bad, in order to understand the world and ourselves. Pull up a chair at our dinner table as the husband and wife team of Dr. John Matthias, a forensic psychologist, and Lauren Matthias, a journalist, delve into the psychological facets of unthinkable crimes.

      "description": "Parallel to the LDS Church\u2019s shifting position regarding homosexuality, there have been new crops of faithful gay public figures who are held up by the church as role models on how to be a faithful gay member of the church. As the LDS Church has softened its stances and opened the window for \u201Crighteous celibacy,\u201D gay public figures in mixed-orientation marriages have lost popularity and a more nuanced breed of celibate role models has emerged E.g. Charlie Bird and Ben Schilatty.\n In this episode we discuss how these public figures enable the perpetuation of harmful church rhetoric and spiritual trauma towards the LGBTQ community, and explore some possible solutions that could help ignite positive change in the church.\n Show notes:\n  Mormon Stories\u0027 interview with Gerardo Sumano Mormon Stories\u0027 interview with Kyle Ashworth Tyler\u0027s review of \u201CWithout the Mask\u201D \u201CWithout the Mask: Coming Out and into God\u2019s Light\u201D by Charlie Bird \u0022Coming Out Mormon: An Examination of Religious Orientation, Spiritual Trauma, and PTSD Among Mormon and Ex-Mormon LGBTQQA Adults\u0022 by Brian William Simmons \u0022Navigating Sexual and Religious Identity Conflict: A Mormon Perspective\u0022 by John Dehlin \u201CBeliever\u201D - HBO documentary \u0022Psychosocial Correlates of Religious Approaches to Same-Sex Attraction: A Mormon Perspective\u0022 by John Dehlin \u0022Sexual Orientation Change Efforts, Identity Conflict, and Psychosocial Health Amongst Same-Sex Attracted Mormons\u0022 By John Dehlin \u201CTabernacles of Clay: Sexuality and Gender in Modern Mormonism\u201D by Taylor G.

      "description": "Are Mormon missionaries who lead tours at historic church sites like those across upstate New York told to teach false information about the church\u2019s founding? Mormon Stories producer and co-host Carah Burrell takes the reins for her second episode as lead interviewer of our guest Camille Jones as we talk with her about serving in Palmyra, New York at the LDS church\u2019s visitor center.\n In part one of our two-part interview with Camille, we discuss the narrative the church wants to be forwarded about the church\u2019s founding versus what Camille wishes she would have known while volunteering as a full-time missionary. We cover topics from the golden plates, to the Hill Cumorah, and more. Camille also discusses the confusing and uncomfortable advances older Mormon men have made on her throughout her teen years.\n This eye-opening experience highlighted the power imbalance between Mormon men and women, a theme that carries on into part 2 where Camille discusses being employed by the church.\n Show notes:\n  Ghost of Eternal Polygamy by Carol Lynn Pearson What Progressive Mormons Want with Julienna Viegas-Haws  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n We are 100% donor funded!

      "description": "In April of 2019 Brigham Young University valedictorian Matt Easton came out as a faithful gay Mormon during his valedictorian address, which was pre-approved by the LDS Church. Matt\u0027s speech received very positive national media attention, including an appearance on the Ellen Show. Matt is currently attending U.C. Berkeley as a Political Science Ph.D. student.\n Last week, Mormon apostle Jeffrey R. Holland publicly \u0022called out\u0022 Matt Easton, accusing him of \u0022commandeering\u0022 the 2019 graduation ceremony. His exact words were:\n \u0022If a student commandeers a graduation podium intended to represent everyone getting diplomas in order to announce his personal sexual orientation, what might another speaker feel free to announce the next year until eventually anything goes? What might commencement come to mean \u2014 or not mean \u2014 if we push individual license over institutional dignity for very long? Do we simply end up with more divisiveness in our culture than we already have? And we already have too much everywhere.\u0022\n Please join us on August 29, 2021 at 1:30pm Utah time as Matt Easton shares with us his Mormon story, and responds to Elder Holland\u0027s irresponsible attacks.\n Show Notes:\n  Matt Easton\u0027s Valedictorian address.

      "description": "As most Mormons are just now beginning to learn, Joseph Smith left multiple and varied First Vision accounts that changed dramatically over time. Joseph Smith\u0027s 1st handwritten First Vision account was produced in 1832, and was intentionally hidden from LDS Church members for over a century and a half - primarily because of the many problems it presented to orthodox belief. The \u0022official\u0022 First Vision account that the LDS Church ended up adopting is the 1838 version, which varies in several significant ways from the previous versions - primarily reflecting Joseph Smith\u0027s evolving theological beliefs.\n Join us today as John Larsen analyzes Joseph Smith\u0027s FIRST (1832) handwritten First Vision account, and explores the many difficulties this version presents to modern Mormon faith.\n Show notes:\n  Joseph Smith Papers MormonThink IRR.org Mormon Infographics Letter for my Wife Mormon Stories Really good comparison chart Wilford Wood museum  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n We are 100% donor funded!

      "description": "Over the past few days the Intensive Care Units in Utah hospitals and around the U.S. began to overflow with COVID patients. Reports began to emerge that as high as 99% of the ICU patients and deceased were not vaccinated from COVID. In addition, the LDS Church First Presidency released a new announcement a few days ago urging members to be vaccinated. This announcement has caused many vaccine-hesitant LDS church members to question their faith in the LDS church, and/or in LDS Church president Russell M. Nelson. The announcement also has spurned several interesting conspiracy theories. There has also been a variety of responses from local LDS bishops, stake presidents, and members - from supportive to unsupportive.\n On August 17th between 9am and 10am mountain time please join us as we assemble a panel of physicians and experts to discuss the status of the COVID vaccine in the U.S., in Utah, and in the LDS Church. The conversation will avoid politics, will be science-based, and we will take questions from the viewing audience.\n Please join us, and please spread the word.\n ---------------\n We are 100% donor funded!
