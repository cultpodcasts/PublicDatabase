      "description": "In this episode, Steven Pierce and Matt Mundy talk with the project\u0027s creators, screenwriters and director Luke Meyer and Keith Newton about their very personal docu-series, The Fourth Wall.\n\nFor any filmmaker, telling the story and history of a cult with an ever-evolving facade, lead by a mercurial leader can not only take years, but can be difficult to pin down. And when said leader is your own father, it can be beyond daunting...becoming more and more personal as the layers are peeled back.\n\nPremiering at Tribeca Film Festival 2023, The Fourth Wall is \u0022an intimate documentary series in which the son of cult leaders investigates the transgressive group in which he was raised. This is the story of the Sullivanians, New York\u2019s secretive \u0027psychotherapy cult,\u0027 which was hidden in plain sight on Manhattan\u0027s Upper West Side in the 1970s and \u201980s.\u0022 \n- Tribecafilm.com (https://tribecafilm.com/films/fourth-wall-2023) \n\n\nTo stay in the loop about more releases and updates about this film, \nalso check out: \n seethink.com (https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/seethink.com__;!!N96JrnIq8IfO5w!jh0o2yvv1B0JKGpo_k5bq-gCaKAhs1KT1TJRQ1qlFEOGCTYsnDF6ZFezjGdK6jLJjqtFpeYxVy91FQ$) \n as well as SeeThink\u2019s Facebook (https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.facebook.com/SeeThink__;!!N96JrnIq8IfO5w!jh0o2yvv1B0JKGpo_k5bq-gCaKAhs1KT1TJRQ1qlFEOGCTYsnDF6ZFezjGdK6jLJjqtFpeaICXHzuA$)  or Instagram (https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.instagram.com/seethinkfilms/__;!!N96JrnIq8IfO5w!jh0o2yvv1B0JKGpo_k5bq-gCaKAhs1KT1TJRQ1qlFEOGCTYsnDF6ZFezjGdK6jLJjqtFpeYxG8m29w$) \u00A0\n \n\nIFG  (https://www.thefp.tv/ifgpodcast) | How Movies Get Made",
