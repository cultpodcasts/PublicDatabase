      "description": "How Eiye and Black Axe Ravaged UNIBEN: Shocking Cult Clashes of 1997 \u0026 2014.\nIn this educational and documentary-style video, we take an in-depth look at the intense and violent confrontations between the Eiye and Black Axe confraternities at the University of Benin (UNIBEN) in 1997 and 2014. These shocking cult clashes left a trail of violence, betrayal, and loss of life, with devastating consequences for both the university community and the surrounding area.\n\nThe video explores the events that escalated these deadly rivalries, the tragic killings of key figures like George, and the ripple effects that spread beyond the university to the streets of Benin. With real insights and analysis, this documentary highlights the consequences of cultism, the destructive power of power struggles, and the toll it took on young lives.\n\nThis video is aimed at raising awareness and educating viewers on the dangers of cultism and violence in academic institutions. It does not encourage cultism or violent behavior but serves as a sobering reminder of the impact such rivalries can have on individuals and communities.\n\n\n#Eiye #BlackAxe #Benin #UNIBEN #Buccaneers #CultClashes #NigeriaDocumentary #EducationalDocumentary",
