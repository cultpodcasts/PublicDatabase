      "description": "As the Aum Shinrikyo movements gains national, then global, attention, the founder Shoko Asahara begins to move his followers in a darker direction. Convinced that the world can only truly be saved through mass casualty events, Asahara first predicts massive disasters -- and then orders his followers to create these events themselves. In chapter two of this strange two-part series, Ben and Matt learn how Aum committed multiple acts of terror, murder, extortion and fraud leading up to their infamous sarin attacks on the Tokyo subway... and what happened to the cult in the aftermath.\nThey don\u0027t want you to read our book.: https://static.macmillan.com/static/fib/stuff-you-should-read/\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",

But how can we get tell the truth from the fiction, and separate the fact from the rumor? Since 2008, Stuff They Don\u0027t Want You To Know has delved into the murky world of everything from cults to lost cosmonauts and allegations of the paranormal, applying critical thinking to the world\u0027s most prevalent conspiracy theories and, more often than not, discovering the disturbing grains of truth hidden in the heart of paranoia. Join Ben, Matt and Noel as they embark on their continuing quest to fit the puzzle pieces together, to connect the dots and follow the breadcrumbs into the truth behind the curtain, from the furthest reaches of the universe to the innermost depths of the human mind.

He has lived in Nashville, Quetzaltenango and, currently, Atlanta. He spent much of his youth traveling, conducting bizarre experiments, watching the Twilight Zone and hunting reports of paranormal activity. He is the recipient of numerous awards for writing and onstage performance. The legends surrounding his family\u0027s past instilled within him a fascination with the fringes of what\u0027s known to be true -- an obsession, of sorts, with the blank spaces on the edges of the map -- and, most importantly, a certainty the world is both understandable and worth understanding. He coined the term \u201Cconspiracy realism\u201D and believes a good idea can change the world.\n\nMatt Frederick spent his earliest years almost exclusively outside, but this time was cut short by Nintendo\u2019s dark designs. Thankfully Matt retained his desire to \u2018hit things with sticks\u2019 - a skill that would lead him to play drums in the Super Bowl XXXIV Halftime Show. In 2002 Matt portrayed an aging, one-armed man named Candy in \u201COf Mice and Men\u201D at the International Thespian Conference in Lincoln, Nebraska (where he hugged his future wife for the first time). In his college years, while working as a servant of sorts at a prestigious private club in Atlanta, Matt became highly aware of the sharp divisions in our society.\n\nNoel Brown is a podcaster, musician, and filmmaker living in Atlanta, Georgia. Born to two opera singers in Wurzburg Germany, Brown spent his early childhood traveling abroad with his parents, making his home in the dressing rooms of great opera houses the world over. As he wandered through these clandestine corners of high society, Brown developed an unshakable sense that something hidden was operating beneath the surface of it all. Something sinister and unseen pulling the strings. Brown took his first dive into the world of conspiracy realism with a documentary on the Georgia Guidestones, a mysterious granite monument bearing a list of commandments for establishing a new world order. The film went on to win the award for best documentary short at the Atlanta Film Festival. Now, as a member of the Stuff They Don\u0027t Want You to Know hive-mind, Brown has made a full-time job of chasing the truth around unseen forces that shape our world.\n\n#stdwytk #stufftheydontwantyoutoknow #conspiracy #podcast",
