      "description": "Colin Ebsworth is a Perth-based stand up who literally grew up in the Unification Church, often called the Moonies, and he\u2019s turned that wild white-suit childhood into a multiple smash-hit, sold-out comedy shows. In this episode he pulls back the curtain on the psychology of comedy, sharing incredible insights into why we laugh, how belief shapes every punchline and what happens when your brain kicks into full ADHD turbo mode. It\u2019s packed with incredible stories from his days in the cult and beyond, and his life is as fascinating as he is hilarious. You\u2019ll never look at comedy or cults the same way again.
