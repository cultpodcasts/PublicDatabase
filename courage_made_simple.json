      "description": "In this second of their two conversations, Margareta Kull and Jackie Johnson (Executive Director of ICSA) focus on what leaders can learn from high-control systems and cults. Drawing on Jackie\u2019s work with organisations, government and cult recovery, they explore how fear, pressure and manipulation can take hold in workplaces. They discuss early warning signs, the cost of ignoring discomfort, and how curiosity, self-reflection and listening are essential to creating healthy environments. Courage, they argue, often begins with pausing, seeing reality clearly, and deciding what to do when you sense something is off.\n\n\n\nWant to get in touch with Jackie? Contact us here (https://courageous-leader.com/pages/contact-us)  and we\u2019ll connect you. Jackie has changed her email since these episodes were recorded, but she\u2019s still with ICSA (https://internationalculticstudies.org/)  in the USA.\n\n\n\nTo learn more about our Courageous Leader\u2122 Process Programme, click here (https://courageous-leader.com/pages/selfstudy) .
