After reading the book \u0022The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying\u0022 I felt compelled to engage with the study groups offered at the end of the book. After years of going to Rigpa study groups and yearly retreats more and more information about the questionable behaviors of the books author, Sogyal Rinpoche, kept coming out. This seemingly innocent study group, which was inspired by the genuine interest in the Buddhas teachings, had turned into a prototypical cult, lock stock with, sexual and psychological abuse, harems, beatings and free labor. This 3 part video series is talking about my coming to terms with being in a buddhist cult, especially when the initial motivation for studying the buddhist teachings was to decrease my ego identification.
