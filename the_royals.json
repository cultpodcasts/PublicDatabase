      "description": "He will now be known simply as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. The man formerly known as Prince Andrew is being stripped of his titles and removed from his mansion, Royal Lodge, on the Windsor estate. Last month The Times obtained a copy of the leasehold agreement for Royal Lodge which showed that while the prince paid \u00A31 million for the lease plus at least \u00A37.5 million for refurbishments completed in 2005, he has paid \u201Cone peppercorn (if demanded)\u201D in rent per year, since 2003. Andrew\u0027s links with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein brought increasing public and political demands for action. It is a seismic moment in royal history \u2013 but is it enough? Roya is joined on the podcast by Aubrey Allegretti, the paper\u0027s chief political correspondent and George Greenwood, investigations reporter for The Times.
