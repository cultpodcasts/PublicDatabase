      "description": "In this first installment of our two-part deep dive, we unravel the origins of one of the most infamous hate groups in modern American history: the Westboro Baptist Church. We\u2019ll explore Fred Phelps\u2019s twisted evolution from civil rights lawyer to brimstone-obsessed patriarch of a cult built on cruelty, and the roots of the Church\u2019s anti-gay crusade.\n\nWe\u2019ll also fact-check one of the internet\u2019s most persistent myths: Did Ricki Lake really throw Fred Phelps off her show in 1993? We\u2019ve got the receipts.\n\nExpect uncomfortable truths, survivor insights, and a whole lot of righteous anger. This isn\u2019t a church. It\u2019s a cult. And we\u2019re not pulling any punches.\n\nTOPICS COVERED:\n* Fred Phelps\u2019s early years \u0026 family indoctrination\n* The launch of the WBC hate campaign\n* That notorious Ricki Lake episode (and what really happened)\n* How memory distorts history\u2014and why truth matters\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/ACMQpod\n\n\uD83C\uDF99\uFE0F New to streaming or looking to level up?
