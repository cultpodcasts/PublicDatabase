For this bonus episode, we\u0027re bringing back our old friend and former Season 3 co-host  Ashlen, who\u0027s been hard at work helping people recover from controlling groups through her LLC People Leave Cults, and has become a source of education on the topic in the media. In addition to appearing on the latest Hulu docuseries \u0022How I Escaped My Cult,\u0022 Ashlen is now an executive producer on the film \u0022Beyond the Fence,\u0022 which is now in development.\n Our other guest is the writer, director and producer of this film, Lindsey Paulette, who is going to tell us more about the project and the story, which can be purchased as a\u00A0book. \u0022Beyond the Fence\u0022 is about about four sisters growing up in and escaping an extreme, controlling group in  Appalachia. It explores themes such as family relationships, cult dynamics and patriarchal abuse. Ashlen said she\u0027d like to eventually use the film as a medium for psychoeducation.\n *Music by Lee Dunn, opening/closing song by The Chaw\n *Editing by Dhyana Levey\n \u00A0\n  \n \n For more information or to watch the concept trailer go to: beyondthefencemovie.com/\n To purchase the book go to: amazon.com/dp/B0DCG2FTD2",

Blavatsky, from the age of 11 to almost 17. She pursued legal action against him in 1997, and he was eventually  arrested in 2019 and  extradited to Canada to be charged with rape and assault of a minor. \r\n\r\n Her case was plagued with delays and procedural mishaps from the get go, and her abuser went free in 2023 on a technicality. Now Brenda is due back in court this month to face the Canadian police constable accused of neglecting her case. \r\n\r\n But she\u0027s already lived a lifetime of gaslighting and victim blaming that shut down her ability to report crimes and even pursue mental health treatment. It was enough to keep her silent for years. \r\n\r\n Now she wants to tell her story. \r\n\r\n Join us to discuss the breakdown of family, legal and medical systems that perpetuated Brenda\u0027s abuse since the 1970s. \r\n\r\n ***This is an intense episode with disturbing content describing child sexual assault and torture.

It was a bit like being royalty.\n But then she rejected the whole thing.\n No one of her family status had done that before. Everyone was shocked.\n It was even more surprising when the big, whole divided family agreed to go therapy together.\n Join us to discuss Lynn\u2019s struggles with perfectionism and the discoveries she made that changed the course of her life. She\u2019s written a memoir, has a blog, and a YouTube channel discussing her own experience as a \u201Cheretic,\u201D and addresses family estrangement after leaving a high-control group.\n Spoiler alert: It is possible to reconcile (but not always)\n For more information, go to\u00A0lynsmithgregory.com",

The small, albeit pushy congregation his life centered around in the town of Oregon, IL seemed almost ideal as a small child. But then the immortal leader died. She didn\u0027t come back to life like she was supposed to. And the new leader liked restrictions. There were so many restrictions. Jesse found himself trapped in a cycle of punishment, abuse and humiliation that made his teen years a prison -- both literally and figuratively. Although he eventually got away, there are certain things (like felonies on his permanent record) that he\u0027ll never be able to shake.

      "description": "Most people have heard of Christian Science and passed by the reading rooms, but how much do you know about it? Hilary grew up as a radical reliant Christian Scientist, which meant her family avoided medical intervention in favor of prayer to try to cure ailments. She lived to talk about it, but others weren\u0027t so lucky. As an adult, Hilary became an atheist and started the Leaving Christian Science Podcast on YouTube . Join us to talk about the history of this group, which is primarily made up of families who have stayed connected to it since its early days. We\u0027ll also discuss the medical neglect of children and how much pressure church members have experienced in the past to avoid doctors. While this appears to be changing, elderly members still tied to the belief system continue to suffer as they age and fall ill. ***This episode contains descriptions of medical neglect and death.

By that time, the group was renamed Elan Vital and Susan was grappling with a disturbing incident experienced by her and another young girl. And they weren\u0027t the only ones who had problems with a certain mahatma. Susan tried to tell the guru. She tried so hard. But there was no accountability. When the internet became a thing, she put her story online. Not a whole lot happened. But other people started putting up their stories about the group, too. One of them was Don, a former high-ranking official of Elan Vital (the group has since changed its name many times). He also has a few things to say on this episode. Join us for Susan\u0027s story (and some of Don\u0027s). ***This episode contains descriptions of child sexual abuse. Listen with care.

Join us for a discussion with these two writers about the second generation of 3HO. The children of those who joined the organization felt like they were screaming into a void about the abuses they had suffered, especially when they were sent off to boarding schools in India. The complaints reached a crescendo in 2020, and 3HO offered a reparations program to its former second generation members who reported neglect and psychological, physical, and sexual abuse. The program just concluded and Stacie and Philip wrote about it recently for Baaz News in an article titled 3HO\u0027s Boarding Schools Were A Living Hell https://www.baaznews.org/p/3hos-boarding-schools-abuse-yogi-bhajan They\u0027ve covered this group for a while and have much to say about its practices, businesses, treatment of children, and actual efforts to make changes.

She left with only a couple of dollars in her pocket and no idea if that was a lot of money or not. Education was a lifeline but it\u0027s also pretty expensive.

She\u0027s also the co-founder and managing editor of Red Hen Press , author of seven books of poetry, and a teacher at Chapman University.

She grew up in a little-known Christian fundamentalist group referred to as the Geftakys Assembly and, although her family left when she was young, she was impacted greatly by leadership\u0027s harsh rules regarding women and children. So greatly was Grace impacted that she dove into a years-long history/research project and created her own podcast about it called \u0022 In God\u0027s Name: An Unseen Cult .\u0022 New episodes are being released now. Join us as we talk about Grace\u0027s upbringing in the group, how her family left, and why she went back recently to interview former members of the Geftakys Assembly and produce her own show. ***This episode contains descriptions of child abuse Music by Leanne Dunn, opening/closing song by The Chaw Editing by Dhyana Levey",

      "description": "Tamara grew up in a Sufi polygamist organization in the US and England. Her father joined the group when she was 5 and she soon found herself torn between a somewhat \u0022normal\u0022 life with her mother and a bizarre, hard-working communal lifestyle with her dad. Deemed a \u0022special child\u0022 by her father\u0027s group, she was sent to live with the leader, who put her to work caring for young children and cooking and cleaning in his mansion alongside his multiple wives. At age 12, Tamara got married -- a spotty relationship that lasted until she was 20. But when her husband wanted to follow the polygamist practices of the group, she left. On the Season 3 Finale of Generation Cult, Tamara chats with Dhyana and Ashlen about her life and the important role education played in her recovery from abuse. We\u0027ll discuss the culture of polygamist groups and what it was like to get married as a tween.

      "description": "Rhonda\u0027s parents joined the Holy Order of MANS (standing for Mysterian, Agape, Nous and Sophia in Greek, or mystery, love, mind and wisdom in English) when she was a year old. The San Francisco-based group held classes and meetings studying a mix of religions, initially leaning heavily on New Age concepts and Christianity. Children were not allowed to live with parents, so she was raised on a farm with other kids as her parents moved through the ranks of the organization. The Holy Order changed and dropped its New Age associations after the Jonestown tragedy in 1978, when a similar group called the People\u0027s Temple very publicly met its end in a massacre. Rhonda\u0027s parents left shortly after that but continued to practice the concepts they had learned regarding vibrations, colors, light and music. Rhonda\u0027s life was structured by her parents\u0027 beliefs, especially her father\u0027s disgust for particular forms of music and aspects of mainstream society that he deemed \u0022evil.\u0022 Eventually convinced that she was evil as well, Rhonda dealt with her parents\u0027 judgement, lingering trauma from being raised on the farm and current inability to fit in with \u0022normal\u0022 people through substance abuse and other unhealthy practices. But in her 20s, she began to seek help and returned to school. In this one-on-one chat with Rhonda and Dhyana, we discuss a brief history of the Holy Order of MANS, Rhonda\u0027s conflict with her parents and their decision to send her away when she was young, her struggles to fit in and the journey she went on to heal.",

Her parents were convinced that the world was going to end in 2012 and taught the children about survival, encouraged them to stay away from \u0022outsiders,\u0022 kept them minimally homeschooled, and controlled their day-to-day lives. Emily began a tough acclimation to the rest of the world after 2012 came and went, and she was allowed to attend school. When the pandemic began, her parents doubled down on their end times belief and fell deeper into conspiracy theories, particularly regarding the COVID vaccine. While Emily has since moved out of their home, she worries about her siblings who remain. Emily didn\u0027t think she could call herself someone who grew up in a cult but Dhyana and Ashlen disagree and explain why. Join us as we hear her story and discuss family cults, coercion in less recognized settings, and the timely prevalence of conspiracy theories.",

Since you\u0027ll be hearing her voice throughout the new season, we wanted you to get to know her better, so she\u0027s also our guest for this episode. Ashlen grew up in the conservative Church of Christ while living in the midst of Utah\u0027s Mormon culture. Mormons were constantly trying to convert her, while she was trying to convert them. When the strict rules handed down by her church began to cause her panic attacks, she left. Ashlen then went on to help women leave polygamist groups, organize events for the International Cultic Studies Association, contribute to CultNews101 and, most recently, started her own LLC called People Leave Cults.

She left as a young adult when the mental anguish she experienced within the organization threatened to take her life. But that departure sent her on a roller coaster of family detachments that she still rides to this very day.\u00A0 Although relieved to flee the bible-based religion, she continued to believe its teachings and was convinced she was going to die in Armageddon. So, she experimented with everything she had been taught not to do: She smoked cigarettes, tried a few drugs and worked on a pot farm. And she had a lot of sex. Eventually, she began to work in the sex industry as an escort. Find out what happened to Meghan and how she became the person she is today.\u00A0 Thank you so much for listening to Generation Cult.\u00A0 *This episode contains discussions of self-harm and sexuality and is not for younger listeners.

While Gina does talk again about her unattended childhood in the movement, which led to a relationship with a much older man and, subsequently, children, we also discuss other issues with TM overall. Like, why did people get so upset that we brought up Transcendental Meditation at all on the show? Join us as we offer a better-sounding episode touching on Gina\u0027s life in a TM community through age 30, leaving with three kids and a reluctant husband, education in both medicine and cultic groups, as well as her own thoughts on communication about the TM movement. *Image courtesy of Gina Catena",

Join us as we discuss Moon\u0027s children, the church, concerns about its use of guns and Teddy\u0027s recent gun-control activism related to a splinter group called the Sanctuary Church. *Image from comic: Growing Up \u201CMoonie\u201D by Teddy Hose The Nib, posted March 7th, 2019 https://thenib.com/moon-child",
