      "description": "We had a brilliant chat with Danny Rensch, the co-founder of\u00A0chess.com, which went from being a successful start-up to a billion\u00A0dollar company during the pandemic, thanks largely to people being stuck at home. As a kid, Danny was a prodigy, a national champion in the US, who ultimately became disillusioned with the sport.\u00A0But his story is far more complicated than that, given he grew up in a cult called the Church of Immortal Consciousness.",
