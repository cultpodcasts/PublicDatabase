      "title": "The murder of Joy Morgan | Newsbeat Documentaries",
      "description": "A student joins a church accused of \u0022racism\u0022 and \u0022hate\u0022 - and there she meets a killer. Her family say she was seduced by a \u0022cult\u0022 which failed to protect her. Joy Morgan had left home after upsetting her family by calling her sisters \u0022white devils\u0022. A civil rights organisation in the USA, the Southern Poverty Law Center, has defined the church as a \u0022hate group\u0022 and it\u0027s been called a black nationalist group. Israel United in Christ (IUIC) is part of a wider \u0022Black Hebrew Israelite\u0022 movement. The church believes black, Hispanic and Native American people are the descendants of the biblical 12 tribes of Israel. All other ethnic groups will eventually become their \u0022servants\u0022. But IUIC denies it\u0027s a hate group or racist, it doesnt recognise the Southern Poverty Law Center as being reputable and says it teaches all followers to obey the laws of the land. A message that didn\u0027t get through to one member, Shohfah-El Israel - the man who murdered Joy Morgan. Why he killed her remains a mystery, as does where he\u0027s hidden Joy\u0027s body.Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/FHXbqA\n\nMuch more at http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/bbcnewsbeat\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bbcnewsbeat\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/bbcnewsbeat",
