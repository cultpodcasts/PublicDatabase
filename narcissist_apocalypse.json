      "description": "In this episode of Narcissist Apocalypse, Brandon talks with Ruthie about being raised by abusive parents, which led her to joining a cult. Born into a family with malignant and covert narcissists, Ruthie was a scapegoat child, excelling academically but isolated and abused. After being cut off financially, Ruthie was groomed by her cousin to join a cult, initially finding structure and community. However, things changed quickly, as Ruthie was isolated into a commune that used gaslighting, emotional abuse, and physical abuse to keep her in line. It\u0027s a story of scapegoats, physical abuse, sexual abuse, sexual assault, cults, grooming, gaslighting, being good enough, acceptance, financial abuse, crazy making, PTSD, flying monkeys, smear campaigns, love bombing, isolation, self blame, and breaking free. *** CONTENT WARNING - This episode discusses physical abuse, sexual abuse, and sexual assault. *** If you want to be a guest on our survivor story podcast, please click here or send us an email at narcissistapocalypse@gmail.com To help out our podcast, please fill out our listener survey, click here.
