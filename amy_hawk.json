      "description": "\u0022Keep people before ideas.\u0022 - Tia Levings is the bestselling author of \u0022A Well-Trained Wife; My Escape from Christian Patriarchy.\u0022 You might know her from the hit docuseries on Amazon--Shiny Happy People---or the We Can Do Hard Things podcast. In this interview, we discuss the \u0022Biblical\u0022 teachings that conditioned Tia for an abusive marriage, and how those same teachings have conditioned white evangelicals in America for an abusive president. We also talk about how she finally escaped her marriage, and Doug Wilson\u0027s fundamentalist cult. \n\nTia\u0027s book: https://a.co/d/15qsbiz\nTia\u0027s Substack: What the Fundamentalist?! https://tialevings.substack.com/\nTia\u0027s Instagram: @Tialevingswriter\nTia\u0027s Website: www.tialevings.com\n\nAmy\u0027s book: https://a.co/d/cdPgYbA\nRelated video: https://youtu.be/OrNZQBsxCoQ?si=qV0SedR7oHsP_lDM\n\n#trumpism #christiannationalism #religiousnationalism #politics #religion #exvangelical #deconstruction #cults #shinyhappypeople #teenmania #dougwilson",
