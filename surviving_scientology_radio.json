      "description": "This podcast is about the often arbitrary ways in which the Church of Scientology works in real life as opposed to its PR. For example, after spending $50,000, or more, to reach the State of Clear, the new Clear is given a secret letter from L. Ron Hubbard telling them that they are in danger and get onto the OT levels as fast as possible or else! But how can this be if a Clear no longer has his or her Reactive Mind? A Clear is supposed to be at \u0022Cause Over Life\u0022 and able to handle anything. However, they are told they in some kind of danger and won\u0027t discover why until they do OT III Jeffrey Augustine asks Aaron why it can take up to 20 years to move from Clear to OT in Scientology. This is a great question. Aaron explains why this happens to former Sea Org members who are treated like pariahs and lepers. Aaron discusses how David Miscavige used the Golden Age of Tech I and II in an ideological manner to purge older Scientologists who were loyal to Hubbard and not Miscavige. Aaron also offers fascinating insights into young 2nd generation Scientologists who attested that they were past life clears as early as 12 years of age. Aaron\u0027s insights into this and the consequences it caused inside of Scientology are extremely fascinating.",

Guy White next describes how Suzette Hubbard fled the Sea Org and took their infant son with her. The Church of Scientology tried to convince Guy to divorce Suzette and remain in the Sea Org. Guy wanted his son to be with him. However, the Church feared that any custody battle could become a public legal matter and involve Mary Sue Hubbard as Suzette was living with her mother. Guy soon left the Sea Org and he and Suzette worked to reestablish their lives outside of the Sea Org. Guy disabuses the notion that L. Ron and Mary Sue\u0027s children had plenty of money due to their father\u0027s wealth. Indeed, L. Ron Hubbard left very little to his children by Mary Sue. Guy reveals the exact amount. Guy talks about his going to work for the Scientologist-owned Dohring Company as his first job after he left the Sea Org.",

The powerful and effective work of attorney Graham Berry in exposing and getting justice for the elderly victims of Scientology credit card and bank loan frauds. Graham stood out as a true hero in 2019.\n \n 2. Rizza Islam et. al. to stand trial in 2020 for ripping off $3.8 million in a Medicare fraud based on running high school students through the Scientology-Narconon Purification Rundown. Jeffrey comments on his observations of the preliminary criminal trial at which the Islam family defendants used a bizarre sovereign citizen argument.\n \n 3. Mike Rinder explains why he sees an inevitable divorce between the Nation of Islam and the Church of Scientology occurring very soon. Alfreddie Johnson, Tony Muhammad, and Louis Farrakhan are discussed.\n \n 4. Mike and Jeff discuss Scientologists and crime: The Spina Brothers $80 million Medicare fraud for which the brothers will be sentenced in February 2020; the $1.8 billion Ponzi scheme known as GPB Capital Holdings that is owned and operated by Scientologist David Gentile.\n \n 5. Jeffrey asks why the Church of Scientology is defending alleged serial rapist Danny Masterson even as Sea Org member Taryn Teutsch cynically used the #MeToo movement and the rape survivors in Denim Day in an attempt to get her father Mike Rinder fired from Scientology and the Aftermath. 6. Jeffrey mentions that Curacao, the homeport of the Freewinds, is an island engaged in sex trafficking of women from Venezuela and other countries. Curacao is home to the largest open air brothel in the world, the notorious Campo Alegre. Scientology has never once protested sex trafficking or the other human rights abuses on Curacao despite the Church\u0027s claimed commitment the UN Human Rights charter. See Jeffrey\u0027s story on this at his blog: https://scientologymoneyproject.com/2...\n  \n 7. Mike offers an update on Scientology and the Aftermath. 8. Mike makes a prediction about what the Church of Scientology faces in 2020.",

As part of her platform, Shastina opposes the widespread psychiatric drugging of children. Upon learning of her position on psychiatric medications, Scientology sent in an operative from its notorious front group Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR). The CCHR agent met Shastina at a political meeting and gave her a CCHR package of materials.\n \n The agent never told CCHR was a part of the Church of Scientology. Rather, the CCHR agent played upon Shastina\u0027s opposition to drugging children and got her to support CCHR on her podcast. In the podcast, Shastina and Jeffrey also discuss Scientologist Joy Villa and her foray into politics. Of note is Joy Villa\u0027s insistence that she is a Christian and a Scientologist when, in fact, Scientology does not allow its members to engage in other practices and considers all other religions to be implants.\n \n Article on Shastina on the Scientology Money Project: https://scientologymoneyproject.com/2018/04/14/scientology-meddling-into-shastina-sandmans-us-congressional-campaign/",

Her younger sister and brother were also dumped at the Cadet Org when their father joined Scientology\u0027s Sea Org. The Cadet Org was at Stonesland, a hellish old building in England where the children of Sea Org were warehoused. Malnourished in filthy conditions, the children had to steal food, had no toilet paper or soap, and lived in abject poverty. This deprivation was created purposely by the wealthy Church of Scientology and its leader L. Ron Hubbard who at T-Bone steak on his private ship while children starved, had no medical or dental care, and wore rags. Valeska survived starvation, sexual molestation, and mental and physical cruelty inside of Scientology. She left the Sea Org, left Scientology, and is now a wife and a mother of beautiful children. Valeska\u0027s courage and perseverance are an inspiration and show the strength and resilience of the human spirit.",
