      "description": "Raj Boggala requested this video.\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-experience-being-pyramid-scheme-amway-darren-mudd-ggf8c/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amway#:~:text=Amway%20has%20been%20investigated%20in,illegal%20business%20practices%20in%20India.\n\nAmway-alleged pyramid scheme practices.\n#Telugu video: Amway is a Cult \u0026 FRAUD SCHEME,SCAM!\n           Amway-alleged pyramid scheme practices.\nAbout Channel:\nI am writing here, everything about my life, journey from India to America. \n\n\u201CKumar Exclusive, has been painstakingly talking about the H1-B violations, and how \u2018desi\u2019 consulting companies have been abusing the American immigration laws for decades. I hope enough people are watching this channel and waking up to the fact that most Indians\u2019 lives in America are far from rosy, and how desperation and greed can lead them into a rabbit hole \u0027the murky world of Indian Incs, Vendors, Prime Vendors, and their various \u2018layers\u2019\u0027, which offers no respite or hope. It\u2019s all the more heartening to know that an Indian is talking about ethics, morality, and doing the right thing, because \u2014 and there\u2019s no other way to put it \u2014 Indians aren\u2019t the most moral lot. People can of course point towards the social and economic realities as the reasons for our dishonesty, but here\u2019s the thing: What\u2019s wrong is wrong. Which is why it\u2019s so heartening to see an Indian not mince words and talk about this underground industry, which has taken an economic and mental toll on tens of thousands of Indians, particularly young graduates, who can do better in life than fake resumes, stage interviews, dupe employers. \u201C\n\nKE YouTube channel, in particular, was a great source of help for many investigative journalists to investigate further or write books on H1-B topics. This is how KE is helpful to many Indians victims in the USA/India and several Dream America aspirants across the globe. -KE.\n\n\nSubscribe to My channel at  https://www.youtube.com/@KumarPandruvada \nCheck out My website: https://kumarexclusive.com/my-life-story/\nConnect with me on my social media handles:\nFacebook:  https://www.facebook.com/KumarexclusiveFB\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/KumarExclusive\nemail: kumar@kumarexclusive.com \n\nKumar does not represent by anyone.\nif anyone ask money for VISA - any visas.
