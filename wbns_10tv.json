      "description": "The slaying of a South Korean woman during an initiation process for a group that called itself Soldiers of Christ has shocked the large Korean American community in metro Atlanta. \n\nCommunity leaders say Korean Americans need to be more vigilant to protect against religious cults and the possible exploitation of new arrivals from South Korea. \n\nPolice discovered 33-year-old Sehee Cho\u0027s emaciated body in September in the trunk of a car left outside a Korean spa. The spa is located in an area of metro Atlanta dubbed \u201CThe Seoul of the South\u201D for its abundance of Korean businesses. \n\nProsecutors have lodged murder charges against three brothers, their mom, and three others.",
