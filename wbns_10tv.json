      "description": "The billionaire behind the retail empire that once blanketed shopping malls with names such as Victoria\u2019s Secret and Abercrombie \u0026 Fitch told members of Congress on Wednesday that he was \u201Cduped by a world-class con man\u201D \u2014 close financial adviser Jeffrey Epstein. Les Wexner also denied knowing about the late sex offender\u2019s crimes or participating in Epstein\u2019s abuse of girls and young women.\r\n\r\n\u201CI was naive, foolish, and gullible to put any trust in Jeffrey Epstein. He was a con man. And while I was conned, I have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide,\u201D the 88-year-old retired founder of L Brands said in a statement to the House Oversight and Reform Committee released before his interview.\r\n\r\nFULL STORY: https://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/les-wexner-deposed-house-committee-jeffrey-epstein-investigation/530-8a3ab5d1-3452-4855-b427-a4c4ec58e82a\r\n\r\nThe panel\u0027s Democrats had subpoenaed him after the latest Justice Department release of Epstein-related documents revealed new details about Wexner\u2019s relationship with the well-connected financier. Ranking member Rep. James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, said that Wexner \u201Canswered every question asked of him\u201D during the 6-hour proceeding and that a video and transcript would be released soon.\r\n\r\nWexner described himself to the lawmakers as a philanthropist, community builder and grandfather who always strove \u201Cto live my life in an ethical manner in line with my moral compass,\u201D according to the statement. He said he was eager \u201Cto set the record straight\u201D about his ties with Epstein. Their relation ended bitterly in 2007, after the Wexners discovered he\u0027d been stealing from them.\r\n\r\nAs one of Epstein\u2019s most prominent former friends, Wexner has spent years answering for their decades-long association and he sought to use the proceeding to dispel what he called \u201Coutrageous untrue statements and hurtful rumor, innuendo, and speculation\u201D that have shadowed him.\r\n\r\nRep. Robert Garcia, a California Democrat who sat in on Wednesday\u0027s interview, expressed skepticism in comments to reporters gathered near the proceeding.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere is no single person that was more involved in providing Jeffrey Epstein with the financial support to commit his crimes than Les Wexner,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\nIn response to allegations by the prominent late Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre, who claimed in court documents that Wexner was among men Epstein trafficked her to, Wexner testified to utter devotion to his wife of 33 years, Abigail. He said he\u0027d never once been unfaithful \u201Cin any way, shape, or form. Never. Any suggestion to the contrary is absolutely and entirely false.\u201D\r\n\r\nWexner\u0027s name appears more than 1,000 times in the Epstein files, which does not imply guilt and Wexner has never been charged with any crimes. His spokesperson said the number of mentions is not unexpected given their long-running ties.",
