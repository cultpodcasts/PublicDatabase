      "description": "Breaking free from a controlled world is one thing. Rebuilding a life without education, resources, or a safety net is something far more extraordinary.\n\nIn this episode, Michelle Coyle meets with Ken Okazaki who shares how growing up in a cult shaped every belief he had and why questioning those beliefs became the first act of freedom. Leaving the group meant stepping into adulthood with zero preparation. His first break came from learning media inside his father\u2019s seminar company, which opened the door to events, storytelling, and high\u2011stakes production at a scale he never imagined.\n\nKen also reveals the devastating event failure that nearly ruined him\u2014and the decision to pay back every customer over two years instead of walking away. That commitment became the foundation of his reputation and the launchpad for the global content agency he runs today.\n\nReady to rethink what\u2019s possible?
