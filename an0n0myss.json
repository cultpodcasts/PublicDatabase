      "description": "May, 1982. In the wake of landmark IRS and FBI investigations into the \u0022Church\u0022 of Scientology\u0027s criminal activities, the city of Clearwater, Florida\u0027s City Council held hearings delving into the CoS plot to infiltrate and overrun the Clearwater area. The CoS had set up their Flag operations under \u0022Operation Normandy\u0022 in the Fort Harrison Hotel in 1975 and since, Clearwater has become a mecca for over 8,000 of Scientology\u0027s cultish goons and lavish home to celebrity space cadet, Lisa Marie Presley.\r\n\r\nOver the week of those hearings, the local public station televised the proceedings and the denizens of Clearwater were glued to their sets in horror as evidence of CoS crimes and misconduct came to light, which subsequently rallied the residents in a demonstration of protest against the \u0022church\u0022\u0027s overtaking of the city, filling a nearby stadium.\r\n\r\nNo State or Federal agencies came to the aid of Clearwater during those hearings, and subsequently, the people of that quiet city unwittingly surrendered Clearwater to the Cult of Scientology.\r\n\r\nThis video distills nearly three hours of sworn testimony given that week by Scott Mayer, former high ranking executive of the Cult and Captain of L, Ron Hitler\u0027s entire West Coast Fleet. Though there was an entire week of testimony given by various witnesses, (including writer Paulette Cooper, victim of the notorious CoS \u0022Operation Freakout\u0022) Mr. Mayer\u0027s testimony is arguably the most damaging and all encompassing public insight into the insidious operations of the suppressive, scandalous and criminal institution known as the \u0022Church\u0022 of Scientology.",
