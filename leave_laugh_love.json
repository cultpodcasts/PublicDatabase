      "description": "Charlotte was once the pro-life movement\u0027s poster child-- a young survivor of sexual assault who wanted to carry her baby to term. As a child, her story was exploited by the movement to further the push for extreme anti-abortion policy. As she grew and evolved, her opinions on policy became more complex, and eventually led her to quietly step back from the movement. When she found herself considering abortion as an adult, former friends from the movement filed a fraudulent affidavit in an attempt to prevent her from attending her appointment. Charlotte\u0027s story is one I wish she didn\u0027t have to tell, but a deeply important one nonetheless. She speaks to the exploitation of minors and vulnerable communities within the pro-life movement, and the extreme lengths they will go to if you attempt to leave.

You can find Nicole @transfiguredcatholic on YouTube and Instagram. Subscribe to our Patreon and give us a follow @leavelaughlovepod on Instagram and TikTok to stay up to date! Show Notes Dignitas Infinita , the declaration on human dignity by the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith. What Vatican II ALMOST Taught About Sex Changes , Catholic Answers, November 17, 2021. Nicole references a draft of a document that didn\u2019t make the final cut of promulgated documents from the Second Vatican Council. I can\u2019t find a ton about it online, but you can check out Fr. Hugh Barbour, O. Praem., talking about it for 37 minutes on Catholic Answers (or read the transcript like I did). Coccinelle was an iconic French celebrity actress who underwent sex reassignment surgery in 1958, widely believed to be the first celebrity to do so. Coccinelle went on to marry a cis man in the Catholic Church, a fact which Nicole thinks sparked the discussions surrounding sex reassignment at Vatican II (see above). I\u2019m obsessed with her. Click here for a bio of Coccinelle . In 1997, Cardinal Raymond Burke approved the founding of the Francsican Servants of Jesus by trans woman Julie Green in La Crosse, Wisconsin. This is so shocking today because of Cardinal Burke\u2019s current and outspoken anti-LGBT views . In 1975, one couple sought an annulment that rocked the Church and suggests that the Church\u2019s positions on how to determine sex and gender are not so black and white as the conservatives want us to believe. Read about it here: High Court\u2019s 1975 Decision Points to Alternative Vatican Path on Gender Identity Issues , New Ways Ministry, June 17, 2019. Some Gender-Affirming Care May Be Permitted, Says Vatican Cardinal , New Ways Ministry, March 14, 2025. This article references new comments from Cardinal Victor Manuel Fern\u00E1ndez regarding the permissibility of sex reassignment surgeries. Cardinal Fern\u00E1ndez is the prefect of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith and originally penned Dignitas Infinita. Read the unexpected and fascinating story of St. Marina the Monk here (yes this links to Wikipedia, but trust me, this narrative is way more readable than other sources ). Read along with the Office of Readings for the feast of Sts. Basil the Great and Gregory Nazianzen here . Here\u2019s just a snippet: \u201CIn this way we began to feel affection for each other. When, in the course of time, we acknowledged our friendship and recognized that our ambition was a life of true wisdom, we became everything to each other: we shared the same lodging, the same table, the same desires, the same goal. Our love for each other grew daily warmer and deeper.\u201D",
