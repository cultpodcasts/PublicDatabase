      "description": "Chris Shelton spent 27 years working for the Church, as Class V Org staff at first, before becoming a Sea Organization member. He spent many years at continental management, and later executed many missions and projects for Ideal Orgs. Chris also worked at Bridge Publications and the Advanced Org of Los Angeles. Shelton also spent time in the Sea Organization\u0027s brutal Rehabilitation Project Force.\n\nAfter seeing firsthand that Scientology\u0027s programs and actions were all about making money and not spiritual freedom, Shelton decided to leave the Sea Org a year ago. He was harassed and intimidated into keeping quiet, and quickly found out the full truth about the organization to which he had devoted his life. He publicly spoke out against it and as a result, lost his fianc\u00E9, many long-time friends, and was also declared a \u0022Suppressive Person\u0022. Despite these losses, Chris continues to speak out against the Scientology\u0027s abuses.\n\nRecorded at Flag Down 2014 - Exposing the fraud and abuse of the Scientology cult",

To say that Jamie has things to say about his great grandfather would be an understatement.

      "description": "\u0022Walking down a street in Stuttgart I never imagined I\u0027d lose the next 22 years of my life\u0022 says John.\n\nWhile in the Sea Organisation, John worked 16-hours days for between $8 and $24 dollars a week. When he left the organisation in 2006 at the age of 42, he described himself as feeling \u0022hopelessly suicidal\u0022 - a \u0022ghost\u0022 with no money, no qualifications or transferrable skills, no state entitlements and no way of relating to \u0022wogs\u0022 (non-Scientologists).\n\nJohn has written a book called \u0022The Complex\u0022, in which he describes his two decades within the organisation.\n\nFor the first time ever, a former high-ranking member of the Church of Scientology is lifting the lid on life inside the worlds fastest growing cult. The Complex reveals the true story behind the religion that has ensnared a who\u0027s who list of celebrities such as Tom Cruise and John Travolta, and convinced thousands of ordinary people to join up.\n\nDuignan describes how two years ago he staged a dramatic escape from the elite paramilitary group at the core of the Church, the Sea Organisation, and how he narrowly evaded pursuit by Scientologists from the Office of Special Affairs. He looks back on the 22 years he served in the Church s secret army and describes the hours of sleep deprivation, brain-washing and intense auditing or religious counselling he endured, as he was moulded into a soldier of Scientology. He talks about the money-making-machine at the heart of the Church, the Scientology goal to Clear the Planet and Get Ethics In , the training programmes, the Rehabilitation Project Force and the punishments meted out to anyone who transgresses, including children. We follow his journey through the Church and the painful investigation that leads to his eventual realisation that there is something very wrong at Scientology s core.\n\nThe beliefs of the Church of Scientology might sound like something from a science fiction book but The Complex reveals that the Church\u0027s growing power base is a shocking reality.\n\nhttp://www.ebay.com/usr/spedrofcuk\n\nRecorded at Flag Down 2014 - Exposing the fraud and abuse of the Scientology cult",
