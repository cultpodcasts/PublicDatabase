      "description": "Bhakti Marga, the controversial organisation founded by self-proclaimed guru Paramahamsa Vishwananda \u2014 an Indian spiritual figure facing serious allegations \u2014 is the subject of this video. \n\nAll claims presented are rooted in publicly available information, and this content complies completely under fair use and factual reporting. The thumbnail is an artistic interpretation and free of copyrighted material.\n\nThis is not my video. Note from the original uploader:\n\n\u201CThis video is an introduction to the dangers of the group that calls itself Bhakti Marga, which has moved into West Elmira, New York USA. Seamus tells of his experience as a close witness to the group, and how he came to the unfortunate conclusion that he needs to go public for the sake of informing and protecting the local community, in particular young people, especially males. Seamus has been shunned by the group and the followers in bhakti marga are not allowed to talk to him, because he has information that runs contrary to their teachings, such as \u0022Our guru Vishwananda is God, perfect and infallible\u0022, and, \u0022our swamis are examples of perfect morality and goodness.\u0022 The information I offer runs counter to these beliefs in a way that is perceived as dangerous to their business model.\n\nBhakti Marga has significant plans for explansion in Elmira, which will have far-reaching consequences for us.\n\nTo be clear, this is not a call to a torches-and-pitchforks style witchhunt, rather it is informational so as to act as informed consent for the public who may be interested in (or must associate with professionally) Bhakti Marga. The issues highlighted in this video are not front and center for newcomers to the group, and given the nature of the teachings, their charismatic and predatory leader (Vishwananda), a dose of knowledge from the people who have left the commuity or viewed it close at hand can support discernment. \n\nWhen challenged about the nature of their guru Vishwananda, their response is simply that all critics of Vishwananda and Bhakti Marga are liars, psychos and/or jealous. \n\nMay everyone benefit, and may everyone be protected from harm, including (and especially) the followers of this corrupt leader and his business Bhakti Marga. I attempt to alert Elmirans and other concerned people of the reputation of the neo-Hindu religious organization that has moved into our beloved Elmira. Much of what is discussed in this video is second-hand, but my own experiences with the organization, combined with the sheer amount of negative testimory about bhakti marga, lead to me to believe this is an organization that requires a caveat emptor and a warning. Please take it in the spirit in which it was conceived, as information, with which we are forewarned. Blessings on Elmira and all people.\u201D",

      "description": "Before joining the Hare Krishna cult, please independently research the history of their founder \u0022Prabhupada\u0022. There are countless examples of blatant bigotry, sexism, homophobia, racism, etc. This is information not provided to members when they are thinking of joining but it is only right for \u0022devotees\u0022 to know the truth about their founder whom they worship as \u0022good as god\u0022.\n\nquotes from Hare Krishna cult founder AC Bhaktivedanta Swami: \n\n\u201CIn this regard, the word vikhyatam is very significant. A man is always famous for his aggression toward a beautiful woman, and such aggression is sometimes considered r\u03B1pe. Although rape is not legally allowed, it is a fact that a woman likes a man who is very expert at r\u03B1pe.\u201D\n\n\u201CGenerally, when a woman is attacked by a man\u2013whether her husband or some other man\u2013she enjoys the attack, being too lusty.\u201D\n\n\u0022When a husbandless woman is attacked by an aggressive man, she takes his action to be mercy.\u201D\n\n\u0022Prabhupada: \u201CYes, that is law always. R\u03B1pe means without consent, sex. Otherwise there is no r\u03B1pe. There was a r\u03B1pe case in Calcutta, and the lawyer was very intelligent. He some way or other made the woman admit, \u2018Yes, I felt happiness.\u2019 So he was released. \u2018Here is consent.\u2019 And that\u2019s a fact. Because after all, sex, r\u03B1pe or no r\u03B1pe, they will feel some pleasure. So the lawyer by hook and crook made the woman agree, \u2018Yes, I felt some pleasure.\u2019 \u2018Now, there is consent.\u2019 So he was released. After all, it is an itching sensation. So either by force or by willingly, if there is itching, everyone feels relieved itching it. That\u2019s a psychology. It is not that the woman do not like r\u03B1pe. They like sometimes. They willingly. That is the psychology. Outwardly they show some displeasure, but inwardly they do not. This is the psychology.\u201D (Morning Walk \u2014 May 11, 1975, Perth)",

      "description": "All credit to the original uploader 3HO Cult Info. For more information go to: \n\nhttps://3hocultinfo.wordpress.com/\n\n\nOne of Yogi Bhajan\u2019s original \u0027secretaries\u0027 published a tell-all book and it brought forth a tumult of accusations from other women who were sexually abused by the group leader. The whole 3HO house of cards is crumbling and the, now deceased, leader has been revealed as having been a sexual serial predator, a conman and crook. \nYogi Bhajan himself has been dead since 2004, but the truth about him is finally coming out. In early 2020, his first secretary, a woman he gave the spiritual name Premka, released a tell-all book, 30 years after she left the group. It wasn\u2019t her first effort to reveal the truth about the yogi. She had sued him back in the late 80\u2019s but lacked the resources to fight his legal delays. She ended up settling out of court. Because there was no Internet at the time, many in the 3 H O community didn\u2019t hear about it, or if they did, were told to deny the story and quickly forgot what had actually happened.\nIn early 2020, the book, \u0022Premka-White Bird in a Golden Cage\u0022 by Pamela Saharah Dyson, found an audience. Because of social media the news about the yogi\u0027s sexual predation could not be contained by 3 H O. The reaction to the book grew particularly strong in a Facebook group called \u201CBeyond the Cage\u201D. The Facebook group drew people out and the stories started to flow. So much so that the people in 3 H O couldn\u2019t ignore the stories any more.\nFor more information, check out these articles: \n* LA Magazine - Yogi Bhajan Turned an L.A.

      "title": "Secrets of The Eckankar Cult Exposed...",
      "description": "According to Eck teachings, they believe they have ancient roots. Unfortunately much knowledge was lost to history until Paul Twitchell (Paulji) \u0022rediscovered it.\u0022 He founded Eckankar in 1965. Eckankar followers believe that he studied under two Eck Masters: Sudar Singh in Paris and India, and a elderly monk Rebazar Tarzs in Tibet. They believe that he received the title of the 971st Eck Master from Tarzs in 1965, thus becoming the latest in a series of Masters which began before recorded history. Some of the past Masters are known historical figures; most have been solitary practitioners or have taught small groups. Paul Twitchell apparently gained additional knowledge from Kirpal Singh, an Eastern Guru, founder of the Ruhani Satsang movement.\n\nAfter Paul Twitchell\u0027s death in 1971, Darwin Gross, the 972nd Eck Master became the Mahanta of Eckankar. (A Mahanta is the spiritual leader of Eckankar, a \u0022living manifestation of God\u0022). Subsequently, Sri Harold Klemp (1942-) became the 973rd Eck Master in 1981; he now heads the movement as its Mahanta.\n\nEckankar does not attempt to evangelize the world by aggressively converting individuals to their religion. They do not actively proselytize. However, they do advertise their presence and distribute literature to interested persons.\n\nMembers generally sing or chant a mantra for 20 to 30 minutes each day. HU (pronounced \u0022hue\u0022) is a common mantra; it is an ancient name for God, and is considered a love song to God.\n\nVarious spiritual exercises are promoted by the organization: chanting, contemplation, meditation, singing, trance work and visualization techniques are used to achieve soul travel. Travel during dreams is an area of growing importance in the movement. Dreams are regarded as an important teaching tool; a \u0022look into the heavenly worlds\u0022. Members are urged to keep a dream journal to facilitate study.\n\nWorship Services consist of a readings, singing \u0022HU\u0022, silent contemplation and an open discussion. It \u0022may also include music, group singing and talks\u0022.\n\nInitiations mark an individual\u0027s spiritual progress within Eckankar. At the Second Initiation, one makes a personal commitment. At the fifth initiation, one becomes a Mahdis (High Initiate) and a member of the ECK clergy.\n\nMembers who have reached the Second Initiation are urged to conduct a partial or full fast each Friday.\n\nEckankar considers abortion, divorce, sexual orientation, and a decision to terminate life to be personal matters. They discourage the use of tobacco, alcohol and other drugs. Many followers are active in a community service.\n\nCult Beliefs:\n\nThey believe that Sugmad is a sacred name of God; God is perceived as neither male nor female.\n \nThey believe an ECK Current connects every person with the Heart of Sugmad. It flows from the Creator to the lower levels of existence and then returns to God. It is often called the holy spirit. ECK manifests itself in two forms:\n\nan \u0022Inner Sound\u0022, the \u0022Voice of god calling us home\u0022. The Sound may be present as a sound of nature or as music.\n\nan \u0022Inner Light which is a beacon to light our way\u0022. During spiritual exercises, the light sometimes materializes as \u0022brightness or colors on your inner visual screen\u0022.\n \nEckankar believes in the duality of the soul and body. The soul is the inner, most sacred part of an individual. It is eternal, without beginning or end. It lives only in the present. One\u0027s soul can exist and travel separately from the body and even from the mind.\n \n\nA person is capable of exploring other planes of existence, through Soul Travel. Unlike \u0022Astral Projection\u0022 which is taught by other spiritual traditions, Soul Travel is not limited to the Astral Plane; it allows you to go further and explore any of the god worlds.\n \n\nEckankar has a concept of Karma which is somewhat similar to that found in Hinduism. Through attachment to the five passions (anger, greed, lust, undue attachment to the physical world and vanity) one\u0027s bad karma accumulates. This requires a person to be reincarnated at death, in order have an opportunity to work off the debt of karma in their next life. The goal of Eckists is to pay off all of this accumulated debt and achieve Self-Realization in their present life. Once this state is reached, at death one need not return and spend another lifetime on earth. One is freed from the endless cycles of reincarnation.\n\n\nEckankar is regarded by its followers as the best (but not the only) path to God-realization. Christianity is recognized as an alternate path that can aid a follower to achieve a degree of enlightenment. Christians, and others, may join Eckankar without renouncing their existing religion.",

      "description": "Theology Unleashed is a slimy attempt at preaching to an audience of atheists and as he calls \u0022the odd person in the audience\u0022 that will join his Hindu denomination (\u0022Hare Krishna\u0022/\u0022Krishna consciousness\u0022) \n\nThough he claims to be moderating debates, his real intention is to show his religion in a positive light thus hiding any comments made by myself or other channels pointing to the absurdity in these beliefs. \n \nThe following comment was left on this video that Arjuna has now hidden:\n\nThe Hare Krishna cult considers its \u201Cdisciplic succession\u201D of utmost importance. Followers are taught that the term indicates a true, unbroken chain of spiritual teachers, each a direct disciple of his predecessor. Without being a direct disciple of a teacher in such a succession, they claim, one cannot ever hope to please god and return to their version of heaven.\n\nThe founder makes it very clear in his writings that being connected to an authorized succession is required for a spiritual organization to be authentic and spiritually potent, and he claims that the Hare Krishna movement belongs to such a succession.\n\nSo what is an authorized succession, then?\n\nWell, for the Hare Krishna cult it mainly means that the succession must connect to one of four main successions mentioned in \u201Cthe Puranas\u201D or \u201CVedic scriptures.\u201D Based on those references they believe that spiritual knowledge received outside of these successions is useless. The founder traces his succession to its Puranic roots through a line of teachers that links up with a medieval tradition, which in turn claims descent from one of these four main successions. As support for this lineage, the founder and his followers refer to a song written by the founder\u2019s guru, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati.[3]\n\nSo they\u2019re authorized, right? Then what\u2019s the problem?\n\nIn a tiny nutshell, the problem is threefold: 1) references to the four Puranic successions are questionable and those successions consist of mythological persons only, 2) the medieval succession has questionable roots, and 3) the later succession is largely made up.\n\nThe Hare Krishna cult is quick to counter opposition to its lineage with the claim that it is based on the propagation of teachings (siksha), rather than the formal links between its teachers through spiritual initiation (diksha). But the endless discussions about siksha and diksha make no difference,[4] as the core teachings of the Puranic, medieval, and current successions vary significantly in theory and practice anyway.\nIn India, localized genealogical, familial, historical, and circumstantial evidence from the pre-British era \u2014 all the way into the renaissance era and beyond \u2014 is primarily based on oral traditions and hagiographies. There is very, very little reliable information on actual dates and events, so claims of any spiritual lineage quickly become difficult or impossible to verify.\nLet\u2019s start at the root, then. The existence and acceptance of the Puranic uber-successions is based primarily on a single reference ascribed to the Padma Purana:\n\u201CMantras that are without a disciplic succession do not bear fruit. Therefore the founders of four disciplic successions appeared in the age of Kali. Thus the four world purifying Vaishnavas like Sri (Lakshmi), Brahma, Rudra (Shiva) and Sanaka will appear in the age of Kali, out of Purushottama (Jagannatha Puri) in the land of Utkala (Orissa). Lakshmi accepted Ramanuja, Brahma (the four-faced) accepted Madhvacharya, Rudra accepted Vishnusvami and the four (Kumaras) accepted Nimbaditya.\u201D\n\nThere is currently no existing version of the Padma Purana in which this verse can be found. The reference as it appears most commonly in the Hare Krishna cult actually comes from the Prameya-ratnavali (Chapter 1, verses 5 and 6) by Baladeva Vidyabhusana (who, in the early 1700s, was already desperately trying to establish the authenticity of the Renaissance-era succession[5]). Also, verse 6, the part of the alleged Padma Purana quotation that lists Ramanuja, Madhvacarya, Visnuswami and Nimbaditya, is not found in other instances of references to the Padma Purana, which makes a compelling case that it is an even later addition. Another reference detailing the four lineages and their seminal teachers is attributed to the Garga Samhita, Canto 10, chapter 61, verses 23 to 26. Few translations of this work are available and almost nothing is known about its origin.\n\nThe bottom line is that we simply do not know enough about the origins of the source texts, their manuscripts, their existing editions, evolution, dating, and historical context to say with certainty that they originate the verses as quoted. While this would be problematic in an academic context, or really for anyone concerned with verifiable facts, members of the Hare Krishna cult have a tendency to blindly accept and propagate anything that seems to support their ideologies.\n\nLearn more about what they believe: http://harekrishnathing.com/",

A man is always famous for his aggression toward a beautiful woman, and such aggression is sometimes considered r\u03B1pe. Although rape is not legally allowed, it is a fact that a woman likes a man who is very expert at r\u03B1pe.\u201D\n\n\u201CGenerally, when a woman is attacked by a man\u2013whether her husband or some other man\u2013she enjoys the attack, being too lusty.\u201D\n\n\u0022When a husbandless woman is attacked by an aggressive man, she takes his action to be mercy.\u201D\n\n\u0022Prabhupada: \u201CYes, that is law always. R\u03B1pe means without consent, sex. Otherwise there is no r\u03B1pe. There was a r\u03B1pe case in Calcutta, and the lawyer was very intelligent. He some way or other made the woman admit, \u2018Yes, I felt happiness.\u2019 So he was released. \u2018Here is consent.\u2019 And that\u2019s a fact. Because after all, sex, r\u03B1pe or no r\u03B1pe, they will feel some pleasure. So the lawyer by hook and crook made the woman agree, \u2018Yes, I felt some pleasure.\u2019 \u2018Now, there is consent.\u2019 So he was released. After all, it is an itching sensation. So either by force or by willingly, if there is itching, everyone feels relieved itching it. That\u2019s a psychology. It is not that the woman do not like r\u03B1pe. They like sometimes. They willingly. That is the psychology. Outwardly they show some displeasure, but inwardly they do not. This is the psychology.\u201D (Morning Walk \u2014 May 11, 1975, Perth)",
