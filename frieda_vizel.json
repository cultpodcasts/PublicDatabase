      "description": "There\u0027s a whole emerging world of Hasidic theater, acted by men, and including a cast and stories of men only. This has been a tiny element of the Hasidic world for years - it definitely wasn\u0027t a viable career for anyone until recently. In recent years, the Hasidic theater scene has exploded. So much talent is coming to the fore. It was so much my pleasure to talk to Ari (Arye) Abromowitz, who is a veteran of this scene, who has been there from the beginning of this \u0022revolution\u0022 and has been in many ways its face as he acted in many productions. I learned so much about this arts scene from Ari and this was just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nLink to Ari and Friends: https://mostlymusic.com/products/ari-friends-season-1-episode-1-video\n\nEdited by Lee Korak / https://leekorak.site/",

These are my strongly felt views.\n\nThis video is hardly my most well thought out commentary on the Netflix show Unorthodox.

      "description": "In my work documenting the Hasidic community, I\u0027ve gone to great lengths to bring out of the shadows the story of women in this world and their voices. It has been incredibly difficult, as much of the female sphere is modesty and behind a curtain. Still, I\u0027ve felt it\u0027s important to share this world with you all, as I feel that otherwise, the female experience is invisible, as if erased, out of sight and out of mind. So it\u0027s a great honor for me that the first Hasidic \u0022star\u0022 that I interviewed is a woman. I\u0027ve approached several men, but they were apprehensive. I hope to speak to them one day, but for now, this is my discussion with the lovely Raizy Fried from Inspired Living.\n\nPlease check out Raizy\u0027s website at raizyfried.com",

      "description": "Closed religious communities are the subject of great, lurid fascination. I know this very well because I come from the Hasidic community. People love to hear the stories of the unusual customs and darker sides. For instance, Youtube is full of channels that tell ex-Hasidic, ex-Mormon, ex-Amish and ex-Cult stories and these videos draw hundreds of thousands of views.\u00A0\n\nGuinevere Turner grew up in a cult. In the Lyman Family cult. Is it a cult? Is it a commune? It\u0027s all up for discussion!\n\nWhat\u0027s unique about her is that she doesn\u0027t give the audience the lurid story they want. She also has written about how cults are talked about in the larger society. Her essay in the New Yorker, \u0027My Childhood in a Cult\u0027, influenced my own writing, \u0027Is the Hasidic Community A Cult?\u0027 She also published a book about her life, \u0027When the World Didn\u0027t End.\u0027 \n\nIn this episode, Guinevere joins me to discuss our experiences as women with life stories that draw so much fascination. We talk about why we think the world wants our stories, and why we might not want to give them up. We discuss the Lyman family cult and other groups that are perhaps communes, perhaps cults. A discussion that touches the tip of the iceberg!\n\nLinks are here: \nGuinevere\u0027s memoir: https://www.amazon.com/When-World-Didnt-End-Memoir/dp/0593237595\nEssay in the New Yorker: https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/05/06/my-childhood-in-a-cult\nGuinevere on instagram: https://www.instagram.com/guinevereturner/\nMy essay titled \u0027Is the Hasidic Community a Cult?\u0027: https://friedavizel.com/2020/01/29/is-the-hasidic-community-a-cult/",
