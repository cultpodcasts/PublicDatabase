      "title": "She refused to shave her head and become Satmar | 90 year old Nelly\u0027s story",
      "description": "In today\u2019s video, I\u2019m honored to share with you the remarkable story of Nelly Grussgott. This footage was originally filmed on August 12, 2020\u2014long before I had a YouTube channel. It was part of a project by filmmaker Pearl Gluck, conducted for a documentary she was making with scholar Naomi Seidman about the Bais Yaakov girls\u0027 school movement. Naomi invited me to assist with the interview, and I was there in the room when it was recorded. To get updates on the Documentary, see Palinka Pictures:\nhttps://palinkapictures.com/\n\nFrom the moment I met Nelly, I was completely taken by her. Her life story is one of immense pain and breathtaking resilience\u2014a testimony to survival, transformation, and spirit. Just days after the interview, Nelly made Aliya\u2014she moved to Israel\u2014at the age of 90. We stayed in touch, and I even interviewed her again via Zoom for this channel. But this original interview, which has always felt so precious to me, was never publicly shared until now. With the blessing of Pearl and Naomi, I\u2019ve edited it down and am releasing it here to preserve her memory and her voice for posterity.\n\nAs of today, Nelly Grussgott is 95 years old\u2014bless her soul, may she live to 120.\n\nBorn in Berlin, Germany, in 1930, Nelly witnessed Kristallnacht as a young child. Her early childhood was comfortable\u2014charmed, even\u2014growing up as an only child in a pampered, middle-class Orthodox Jewish home. Her parents were not German-born: her mother, from Czechoslovakia, moved to Berlin at 24 and became successful in the rags/textile business. Her father was Hungarian, and both were deeply religious. Due to the hostility towards Orthodox Jews in Berlin, they adapted to a modern Orthodox lifestyle.\n\nIn 1937, Nelly\u2019s father went to the United States to secure affidavits to bring his family to safety. He succeeded\u2014but history intervened cruelly. While her father was still away, Nelly and her mother were forced out of their home and into an overcrowded apartment with five other Jewish families. One night, Nazi soldiers raided the apartment and took the men at gunpoint. Days later, ashes were returned to their wives in the mail.\n\nIn a desperate move, Nelly\u2019s father returned to Europe in 1938\u2014traveling to Belgium to reunite the family. It proved to be a devastating mistake. Nelly and her mother, Czechoslovakian citizens, were able to emigrate to the U.S. at the very last moment, getting papers as I understand it in late 1939 but actually coming \u0022in the last hour\u0022 in Frebruary 1940. But because her father was Hungarian, and the Hungarian quota was closed, he remained trapped in Europe. His letters continued for several years, growing more despondent until, in 1942, they stopped entirely.\n\nIn 1995, the Red Cross confirmed the fate the family had long feared: Nelly\u2019s father was deported to Majdanek, then to Sobibor in March 1943, where he was murdered, along with many relatives.\n\nNelly\u2019s mother eventually remarried in America, joining with a Satmar Hasid who had also survived great loss. She thrived in Williamsburg, Brooklyn\u2014especially enjoying her later years on Lee Avenue, surrounded by familiar faces and warm greetings. Nelly herself chose a different path, remaining Orthodox but not Hasidic, and went on to raise a mainstream Orthodox family.\n\nI\u2019m deeply grateful to finally bring this interview to light. May Nelly\u2019s story reach far and wide\u2014and may we never forget.",

      "description": "There\u0027s a whole emerging world of Hasidic theater, acted by men, and including a cast and stories of men only. This has been a tiny element of the Hasidic world for years - it definitely wasn\u0027t a viable career for anyone until recently. In recent years, the Hasidic theater scene has exploded. So much talent is coming to the fore. It was so much my pleasure to talk to Ari (Arye) Abromowitz, who is a veteran of this scene, who has been there from the beginning of this \u0022revolution\u0022 and has been in many ways its face as he acted in many productions. I learned so much about this arts scene from Ari and this was just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nLink to Ari and Friends: https://mostlymusic.com/products/ari-friends-season-1-episode-1-video\n\nEdited by Lee Korak / https://leekorak.site/",

      "description": "In my work documenting the Hasidic community, I\u0027ve gone to great lengths to bring out of the shadows the story of women in this world and their voices. It has been incredibly difficult, as much of the female sphere is modesty and behind a curtain. Still, I\u0027ve felt it\u0027s important to share this world with you all, as I feel that otherwise, the female experience is invisible, as if erased, out of sight and out of mind. So it\u0027s a great honor for me that the first Hasidic \u0022star\u0022 that I interviewed is a woman. I\u0027ve approached several men, but they were apprehensive. I hope to speak to them one day, but for now, this is my discussion with the lovely Raizy Fried from Inspired Living.\n\nPlease check out Raizy\u0027s website at raizyfried.com",

      "description": "Closed religious communities are the subject of great, lurid fascination. I know this very well because I come from the Hasidic community. People love to hear the stories of the unusual customs and darker sides. For instance, Youtube is full of channels that tell ex-Hasidic, ex-Mormon, ex-Amish and ex-Cult stories and these videos draw hundreds of thousands of views.\u00A0\n\nGuinevere Turner grew up in a cult. In the Lyman Family cult. Is it a cult? Is it a commune? It\u0027s all up for discussion!\n\nWhat\u0027s unique about her is that she doesn\u0027t give the audience the lurid story they want. She also has written about how cults are talked about in the larger society. Her essay in the New Yorker, \u0027My Childhood in a Cult\u0027, influenced my own writing, \u0027Is the Hasidic Community A Cult?\u0027 She also published a book about her life, \u0027When the World Didn\u0027t End.\u0027 \n\nIn this episode, Guinevere joins me to discuss our experiences as women with life stories that draw so much fascination. We talk about why we think the world wants our stories, and why we might not want to give them up. We discuss the Lyman family cult and other groups that are perhaps communes, perhaps cults.
