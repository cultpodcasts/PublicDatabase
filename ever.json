      "description": "In this video \n\nDaniel Perez, also known as Lou Castro, founded the notorious cult Angel\u0027s Landing in the early 2000s, claiming angelic powers and preying on vulnerable followers. His reign of manipulation and abuse ended in 2010 with his arrest on charges including fraud, m***der, and r*pe. Sentenced to life in prison, Perez, now 65, remains incarcerated, serving time at the Lansing Correctional Facility in Kansas \n\n#angelslanding #loucastro #danielperez #cult #emilyhutson #sara #patriciahughes #brianhughes #documentary #crimedocumentary #educationalvideo #education #thecaseofangelslandingcult #facts #knowledge #amazingfacts #factsinhindi #shockingfacts #information #knowledge  #sharinginfo #facttechz \n\n\nDisclaimer \n\nThis video have been made for education purpose only.
