      "description": "DOJ releases thousands of new documents from Epstein investigation\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has released more than 10,000 additional photos, videos, and documents tied to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, following increased pressure from lawmakers to make the records public. The files include new details about efforts to identify potential co-conspirators. At least one email references President Donald Trump, leading the DOJ to publicly downplay some claims in the documents, calling them false and unfounded. \r\n\r\n#EpsteinFiles\r\n#DepartmentOfJustice\r\n#JeffreyEpstein\r\n#FederalInvestigation\r\n#GhislaineMaxwell",
