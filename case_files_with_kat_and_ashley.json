      "description": "TW: This episode contains discussions of childhood sexual abuse, suicide, and suicidal ideation. These are deeply sensitive topics that may be distressing for some listeners. Please take care of yourself as you listen. If you or someone you know is struggling, help is available. You can call or text the Suicide \u0026 Crisis Lifeline at 988 anytime, 24/7. Teal Swan is a self-proclaimed spiritual healer, author, and YouTube influencer with a devoted following\u2014and a deeply controversial reputation. In this episode, Kat gets fired up as she explores the enigmatic figure behind The Deep End docuseries, the explosive Gateway podcast, and a mountain of public debate. We unpack her origin story, her controversial teachings on suicide and trauma, and the allegations of cult-like behavior swirling around her inner circle. Is Teal Swan a misunderstood healer... or something much darker? Grab a drink and join us!
