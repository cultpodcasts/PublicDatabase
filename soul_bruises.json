We dig into how a therapist wrapped control in spiritual language, turned doubt into \u0027distortion,\u0027 \u0026 built a closed system where obedience looked like healing \u0026 disagreement looked like moral failure. Using the Jodi Hildebrandt documentary as a case study, we trace the slow creep from guidance to coercion \u0026 outline the subtle tells\u2014language shifts, isolation, \u0026 financial pressure\u2014that signal spiritual abuse long before the headlines. We walk through the backstory of Connexions, the promise of moral clarity, \u0026 the way binaries like truth versus distortion hollow out a person\u0027s inner compass. You\u0027ll hear how clients were nudged to distrust their own signals, cut off outside support, \u0026 accept \u0027loving correction\u0027 as proof the process worked. Along the way, we connect these patterns to tactics common in high-control religious spaces: information control, shunning, \u0026 leader-centric authority dressed up as care. The goal isn\u0027t to sensationalize; it\u0027s to name the playbook so you can recognize it early\u2014whether it shows up in therapy, church, parenting advice, or coaching. We also offer practical tools to test any authority: Who can ask questions here? What happens when someone disagrees? Are fees \u0026 expectations transparent? Does this space invite dialogue \u0026 referrals, or does it monopolize trust? Healthy authority connects rather than isolates, welcomes feedback, \u0026 never asks you to abandon yourself to belong. If your body says something is off, that signal matters. Your worth isn\u0027t measured by compliance, \u0026 choosing truth over loyalty is not a failure\u2014it\u0027s healing. Listen, reflect, \u0026 share this conversation with someone who needs language for what they\u0027ve felt but couldn\u0027t name. \u0027Be Human, Be Kind, Be Both.\u0027",

When your voice, appearance, \u0026 very humanity are treated as problems to be fixed rather than gifts to be celebrated? Pastor \u0026 Chaplain, Kristy Hodson takes us deep into her journey through high-control religion, revealing the subtle yet devastating ways spiritual abuse can damage our connection to both community \u0026 the divine. With remarkable honesty, she shares how attempting to create positive change from within left her \u0027bitter, resentful, \u0026 tired\u0027 as she faced resistance for simply refusing to make herself smaller. The conversation explores the unique challenges faced by women in patriarchal religious systems, where something as simple as correcting someone who addresses a room of pastors as \u0027gentlemen\u0027 can lead to being labeled a \u0027militant feminist.\u0027 Kristy explains how the box of conformity becomes a cage, trapping both those who perpetrate spiritual abuse \u0026 those who experience it. Most powerfully, Kristy offers a profound reframing of how we talk about spiritual abuse: \u0027My spirituality was abused by what you did. My soul was harmed \u0026 damaged.\u0027 This shift centers the impact rather than debating whether actions qualify as abuse, making space for true healing to begin. For anyone who has felt their authentic spiritual self diminished by religious control, this episode offers both validation \u0026 hope. Kristy\u0027s journey toward healing includes learning to trust herself again, finding supportive community, \u0026 remembering who she was \u0027before trauma gave me a detour.\u0027 Her message resonates with unmistakable clarity: You are not alone, your voice matters, \u0026 true faith gives you a voice, not a muzzle. Join us for this essential conversation about breaking free from spiritual control \u0026 rediscovering an authentic connection to faith that honors your whole being. Wherever you are on your spiritual journey, this episode invites you to remember that you belong \u0026 that your spirituality is worth defending. \u0027Be Human, Be Kind, Be Both.\u0027",

In this raw \u0026 revealing conversation, Pastor Kristy Hodson shares her journey through a high-control religious environment where authenticity was often sacrificed on the altar of conformity. Drawing from Bren\u00E9 Brown\u0027s powerful distinction\u2014\u0027Fitting in is about becoming who you need to be to be accepted. Belonging doesn\u0027t require us to change who we are; it requires us to be who we are\u0027 Kristy explores how religious systems can demand we amputate essential parts of ourselves to belong. Using the Brothers Grimm version of Cinderella as a striking metaphor, she describes how the stepsisters literally cut off toes to fit into the glass slipper, paralleling how believers are sometimes asked to cut away authentic pieces of themselves to fit religious expectations. The seemingly trivial battles over jewelry, coffee drinking, \u0026 social media posts mask deeper control mechanisms that stifle critical thinking \u0026 personal expression. Kristy\u0027s powerful question\u2014\u0027How much about myself do you want me to lie about?\u0027\u2014challenges us to consider the spiritual cost of conformity. Through her story, we witness the exhausting cycle of trying to change a system from within, only to discover that true freedom comes not from rebellion but from creating your own existence from scratch. This conversation isn\u0027t about abandoning faith but finding authentic expression within it. Whether you\u0027ve experienced spiritual abuse, felt like an outsider in religious spaces, or simply question whether you can be fully yourself while maintaining your faith, this episode offers healing perspectives on belonging without conforming.

      "description": "Send us a text What happens when your loyalty to God becomes twisted into a weapon against your own soul? In this deeply insightful exploration of distorted loyalty, we unravel how spiritual abuse manipulates our noblest virtues into chains of obligation and fear. Distorted loyalty isn\u0027t just about misplacing your allegiance\u2014it\u0027s about how that loyalty functions internally, creating an agonizing inner turmoil that makes you stay in harmful religious environments despite recognizing the damage being done. This episode carefully distinguishes between healthy devotion and the twisted version that leaves you feeling trapped, silenced, and spiritually hostage. Through powerful real-life scenarios, we examine six harmful narratives where distorted loyalty manifests: refusing to address abuse to \u0022avoid division,\u0022 judging other Christians who don\u0027t conform to denominational expectations, equating leaving a church with betraying God, treating questioning as rebellion, reframing silence about wrongdoing as spiritual maturity, and merging personal identity so completely with group identity that departure feels like self-annihilation. Most dangerously, fear-based obedience replaces authentic faith, leading people to stay in abusive systems not from love but from terror of rejection, punishment, or eternal consequences. This distortion fuels what some call \u0022Spiritual Stockholm Syndrome,\u0022 where victims emotionally attach to and defend the very religious systems harming them. For anyone caught in these webs of twisted obligation, this episode offers profound validation and hope. You\u0027re not crazy for recognizing harm. You\u0027re not betraying God by protecting yourself. In fact, walking away from what damages your soul might be the first authentic step toward Him in a very long time. Because true loyalty should never demand the sacrifice of your conscience, dignity, or voice. Have you experienced distorted loyalty in your spiritual journey? How did you recognize it, and what helped you break free? Share your story and join our community working toward healthier, more honest expressions of faith. \u0022Be Human, Be Kind, Be Both.\u0022",

Explore this hidden realm with me, Christie Hodson, as we uncover the manipulation tactic known as DARVO\u2014Deny, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender. Originally identified by psychologist Jennifer Freyd, DARVO is a cunning strategy often used by abusers to twist the truth and avoid accountability. We\u2019ll dissect how spiritual leaders and institutions wield this tactic to paint themselves as victims, thereby complicating the journey to justice for the true sufferers. Understanding the role of bystanders in abuse scenarios is crucial. Often bound by betrayal blindness, they may inadvertently support abusers through inaction. Through infamous cases like Larry Nassar and Bill Hybels, we\u0027ll reveal how abusers manipulate perceptions and how bystanders can break free from these psychological barriers. I challenge every listener to confront their biases and recognize the moral weight of standing up for those who are most vulnerable. Our journey doesn\u0027t stop with identifying the problem; it seeks to transform our spiritual spaces into sanctuaries of support and honesty. We\u2019ll examine the allegations against Bill Hybels and the misuse of DARVO that followed, illustrating the necessity for transparency and accountability. By comparing these situations to how Grace Community Church handled similar accusations, we find a roadmap for creating healthier spiritual environments. Join me on Soul Bruises as we push for a future where awareness, kindness, and humanity reshape our communities. \u0022Be Human, Be Kind, Be Both.\u0022",

In this episode of Soul Bruises, we tackle the harrowing reality of spiritual abuse within religious settings, dissecting how authority and distorted loyalty can morph into instruments of harm. Learn how to differentiate between genuine spiritual authority and the misuse of power that leads to exploitation and suffering, and understand why speaking up is crucial for mental and spiritual well-being. Journey with us as we examine historical and modern figures like William Wilberforce, Pope Gregory the Great, Thomas Merton, Henry J. M. Nouwen \u0026 Jill \u0026 Jinger from the Duggar family, whose lives highlight the dual-edged nature of spiritual authority. By delving into their insights, we uncover the qualities of healthy leadership\u2014humility, accountability, respect for autonomy, and community-building. Through personal stories and testimonies, we shed light on the dark corners of spiritual abuse, offering a pathway to reclaiming faith and trust. In our critical analysis of Bill Gothard\u0027s controversial teachings and the dynamics within his organization, we expose the dangers of absolute obedience and hierarchical control. Hear firsthand accounts from individuals like Jill Duggar Dillard and Jinger Duggar Vuolo, who bravely share their experiences of entrapment and the struggle for autonomy. We close with a hopeful vision for church communities, advocating for empathy and compassion, and highlighting real-world examples of churches making a positive impact.

Today on the Soul Bruises podcast, we return from our hiatus to confront the unsettling reality of spiritual abuse head-on. We explore why it\u0027s critical to listen to the voices of those who\u0027ve endured this trauma, how the term \u0022abuse\u0022 carries a weight that \u0022church hurt\u0022 does not, and why skipping to the positives without addressing the harm is not an option. Victims deserve our attention, our belief, and our action. We delve into the importance of acknowledging these issues to mend broken institutions and facilitate collective healing. In our discussion on healing, we emphasize the need for proper church governance and law enforcement\u0027s role when criminal activities are involved. We explore the development of safety policies and the crucial contributions of organizations like GRACE and Ministry Safe in providing resources and training. We stress the importance of validating victims\u0027 experiences, recognizing religious trauma, and ensuring thorough investigations.

I, Christie, pull back the curtain on the darker side of faith communities, spotlighting the fine line between spiritual guidance and coercive control. With an eye on those who twist faith for their own benefit, Soul Bruises attempts to peel back the layers to reveal behaviors and tactics that harm and control, rather than heal and guide. With insights from author Amanda Montell, we delve into the power of language in high-control groups, showing how words can build walls around minds. Charismatic leaders, such as Jim Jones, used their oratory prowess to bind their followers in an alternate reality. I want this episode to equip you to recognize these patterns and resist their pull. This episode challenges the notion that only certain types of people are susceptible to cultish influence; it\u0027s not about intellect, but situation. Hear how thought-terminating clich\u00E9s serve as red flags, and learn to navigate speech that\u0027s designed to end questioning. Ending on a note of empowerment, we navigate the treacherous waters of spiritual communities led by narcissistic individuals. The misuse of scripture and faith through intimidation and fear is laid bare, urging us to foster environments that welcome questions and personal growth. The touchstone for a healthy faith community, as we will explore, is the ability to engage openly with religious teachings and to prioritize individual discernment. Discover how to recognize spiritual abuse and the importance of reclaiming personal spiritual agency in a space that should champion exploration and diversity of thought. \u0022Be Human, Be Kind, Be Both.\u0022",

This episode pulls back the curtain on the often-invisible abuse of power, where control and authority can distort faith\u0027s nurturing environment. With the wisdom of Diane Langberg guiding us, we dissect the spiritual abuse triad \u2013 power, control, and authority \u2013 and investigate how these forces can either build or destroy. We draw parallels with historical figures like Lincoln, Pittacus and Fred Rogers, exploring the measure of character necessary to handle power justly and the crucial responsibility that comes with wielding it. The allure of charismatic leadership is a double-edged sword, one that can both inspire and devastate. We scrutinize the delicate balance of power in religious settings, particularly within patriarchal structures and traditional barriers against female ordination. The examination goes deeper as we uncover the intricate dance between vulnerability and power and the implications of this dynamic on the character of spiritual leaders. Through the tragic cautionary tale of Jim Jones, we illustrate our collective susceptibility to charming authority and underscore the necessity of discernment in spiritual guidance. As we wrap up this introspective journey, we turn the mirror on ourselves, asking how we individually engage with the power we possess. We reflect on the behaviors and tactics that emerge from wielding influence, stressing the importance of coupling power with compassion and humanity. This episode is not just a listening experience; it\u0027s an invitation to engage with us, to share your thoughts and continue the conversation.

This Soul Bruises episode peels back the layers of deceit woven into the fabric of spiritual communities, using the enigmatic life of John Harvey Kellogg as a case study. As you listen, discover the subtle yet devastating ways that seemingly trustworthy figures mask their true intentions, and how these tactics shape the perilous dynamics of spiritual abuse. This episode brings attention to how crucial it is to differentiate between the outward appearances and the hidden truths, empowering you to stand against manipulation and preserve the sanctity of your spiritual haven.

      "description": "Send us a text Have you ever felt the heavy burden of spiritual abuse within a faith community? Our journey into the shadows of spiritual manipulation begins here, where I hope to guide you through the often-misunderstood realm of spiritual abuse. We\u0027re not just scratching the surface; we\u0027re exposing the deep-rooted patterns of control that have caused generational hurt across all faith traditions. With the expertise of thought leaders like Jeff VanVonderen and James Rochford, we dissect the misuse of religious authority and differentiate between the healable missteps and the intentional harm that demands strong preventive action. Peering into the aftermath of spiritual abuse, we navigate the psychological maze with guidance from experts like Ron Enroth, Dr. Lisa Oakley, Justin Humphreys, and many more as we come to understand the profound impact of abuse on the soul. This episode isn\u0027t meant to merely inform; it\u0027s a call to arms for those within the Christian community and beyond to create a culture of prevention and healing. Soul Bruises confronts the controversies head-on, debating the adequacy of the term \u0027spiritual abuse\u0027 and the necessity of using precise language to give appropriate weight to these agonizing experiences. Our resolve is to empower and equip our listeners with the knowledge needed to shield our communities from spiritual predators. Organizations like GRACE are at the forefront, and Soul Bruises shares their mission to initiate a vital cultural shift within the church. Under the leadership of Pete Singer, GRACE\u0027s dedication to protecting the vulnerable highlights that change isn\u0027t just possible; it\u0027s imperative. By tuning in, you\u0027re taking the first step toward standing with the wounded and becoming an advocate for change. \u0022Be Human, Be Kind, Be Both.\u0022",

      "description": "Send us a text As we start on this journey, I\u0027d like to echo the words of Elie Weisel: \u0022Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.\u0022 With this episode, we\u0027re raising our voices against an oppressor that often goes unnoticed - spiritual abuse. Through personal experiences, insights from experts, and stories of those who\u0027ve survived, we\u0027ll navigate this often misunderstood, but deeply consequential issue. Specifically, we\u0027ll examine how the Christian community, the very sanctuary that should foster love and acceptance, can inadvertently become a breeding ground for such abuse. In the second half, we bring a ray of hope to those who\u0027ve been victimized, shedding light on the healing process. The existence of spiritual abuse, much like a bone bruise, might be discernible to only the one who experiences the pain. However, acknowledging the pain is the first step towards healing. Drawing parallels to medical wound debriefment, we\u0027ll understand the importance of exposing the injury. We\u0027ll disentangle the fear of harming reputations or the church\u0027s image, emphasizing that the highest service we can offer to God\u0027s kingdom is to ensure it\u0027s a safe space for all. Let\u0027s journey together in this episode as we work towards glorifying God, strengthening the church, and promoting healing for victims of spiritual abuse. \u0022Be Human, Be Kind, Be Both.\u0022",
