      "description": "Step inside Woodmont, a French Gothic Revival ch\u00E2teau built in the 1890s for industrialist Alan Wood Jr., and later transformed into the headquarters of Father Divine and the International Peace Mission. This episode of This House traces the unlikely convergence of Gilded Age opulence and a utopian religious movement: from Father Divine\u2019s early preaching and the 1931 Sayville raid, to Harlem\u2019s free \u201CHoly Communion\u201D banquets, the 1953 move to Woodmont, and the estate\u2019s preservation today.\n\nJoin our Membership program:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkKRXhkY6fcLVT8MLc3FH3Q/join\n\nPublic Domain Photos from: Library of Congress,\nCC BY 2.0 Photos from: Flickr User: Montgomery County Planning Commission\nCC BY-SA 4.0 Photos from: Wikipedia User: Haasmaster\nAssets from: Envato Elements\nMusic from Epidemic Sound",
