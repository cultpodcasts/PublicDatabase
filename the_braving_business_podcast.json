      "description": "In this unforgettable episode of Braving Business, we meet Crystal Ball, whose life is a testament to resilience, reinvention, and the power of embracing freedom. Raised in poverty and repression within the infamous \u201CShiny Happy People\u201D cult, Crystal\u2019s childhood was defined by control and fear. But breaking free was only the beginning.\n\nCrystal shares her journey through profound loss, including surviving Hurricane Michael, losing both grandparents, and helping her husband recover from a stroke\u2014all in one harrowing year.
