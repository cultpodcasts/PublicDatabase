      "description": "This week on Just Sayin\u2019, Justin welcomes Jane Borden, author of Cults Like Us and I Totally Meant to Do That, for a deep dive into the wild world of modern devotion. We\u0027re exploring the fine line between fandom and full-blown cult behavior and asking which celebs would make good cult leaders and whether some already are. Plus, an elephant raids a convenience store for snacks, a graduation backflip ends in a face-kick, TSA reminds us that Costco cards aren\u2019t valid IDs, and the moms fighting for the right to brunch with their hyper-realistic baby dolls.
