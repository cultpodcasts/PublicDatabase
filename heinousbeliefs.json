      "description": "The House of Prayer: Anna Young\u2019s Cult of Control\n\n Season 1 Finale\n\n\n\n\uD83D\uDCCD Episode Summary:\n\n This ain\u0027t your grandma\u2019s Bible study. In our Season One finale, we take you deep inside one of the most twisted so-called religious institutions to ever hide behind scripture: The House of Prayer for All People. At the center of it? Anna Elizabeth Young a woman who styled herself as a prophetess named \u201CMother Anna\u201D but acted more like a prison warden in God\u2019s name.\n\n\n\nIn Gainesville, Florida during the 1980s and \u201890s, Anna created what she called a \u201Cspiritual healing ministry.\u201D But what really happened behind those locked doors was nothing short of psychological warfare. She starved children, beat them, locked them in closets, burned their skin in bleach baths, and denied medical treatment all while quoting the Bible. And for years, she got away with it.\n\n\n\nIn this episode, we walk through the depths of her control, the lives lost under her reign, the survivors who never stopped speaking out, and the long-overdue justice that finally came decades later. With testimonies pulled from court records, media interviews, police reports, and direct survivor accounts, this is one of the most disturbing and important stories we\u2019ve told all season.\n\n\n\n\u26D3\uFE0F Crimes Covered:\n\n \u2022 Religious cult abuse\n\n \u2022 Child starvation and neglect\n\n \u2022 Physical torture\n\n \u2022 Spiritual and psychological manipulation\n\n \u2022 Murder of a minor\n\n \u2022 Coercive isolation and mind control\n\n \u2022 Denial of medical care as religious punishment\n\n \u2022 Abuse of power under a religious veil\n\n\n\n\u26A0\uFE0F Content Warning:\n\n This episode contains detailed discussions of child abuse, trauma, spiritual exploitation, and murder.

You deserved protection, love, and joy not pain. We say your names.\n\n\n\n\uD83D\uDCE3 Season Finale Announcement:\n\n This is the final episode of Season One of Heinous Beliefs. Thank y\u2019all so much for riding with me all the way through this journey. It\u2019s been raw, heavy, emotional and absolutely necessary.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ll be back with Season Two on January 20, 2026, with brand-new stories, deeper research, and even more fearless storytelling about crimes driven by dangerous belief systems.\n\n\n\n\uD83D\uDCA5 But don\u2019t trip we\u2019re not going silent.
