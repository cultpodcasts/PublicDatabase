      "description": "Joseph Kony did not start as the image the world now knows. He was born around 1961 in a small village called Odek, in what is now northern Uganda. As a boy he grew up in a community shaped by religion. He served as an altar boy and learned from local churches. He did not finish school. \n\nAs he grew older, the politics of Uganda changed around him. The country had recently gone through violent struggles and many young men in the region were drawn into armed groups. Kony left his village and became part of movements that resisted the government. \n\nOver time he built his own following and claimed to be a spiritual leader. \nKony presented himself as a prophet. \nHe merged traditional beliefs, his own interpretation of Christianity, and a harsh military style to build the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army, often called the LRA. \nHe ordered his followers to obey him without question! \n\nStay tuned for the full details. \n\nSubscribe!\n\nContact Us: kmn.contents@gmail.com\n\nReferences: \n\nU.S. Department of the Treasury, United Nations\n\nReuters \n\nEncyclopedia Britannica\n\nGlobal Security\n\nInternational Criminal Court\n\nInternational Criminal Court\n\nWikipedia\n\nathena.westpoint.edu\n\nInternational Criminal Court\n\n\n\n\n#zackdfilm #raywilliamjohnson #documentary #finance #africanews",
