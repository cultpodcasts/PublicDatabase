      "description": "Hey everyone, welcome to my channel!  I\u0027m excited to embark on this journey of getting to know you all.\n\nIn this video, I\u0027m cracking open the door to my past and sharing some stories about my upbringing. Let\u0027s just say, it wasn\u0027t your average childhood experience. There were definitely some unique rules and a perspective on the world that wasn\u0027t exactly mainstream.\n\nLeaving that world behind was a big adjustment, but guess what? Stepping outside, I realized there might be a whole different kind of \u0022cult\u0022 out here in the everyday world!\n\nIntrigued? In this video, I\u0027ll share some stories about my unconventional background and how it shaped my view of the world.  Let me know in the comments what you think, and what other things you\u0027d like to see in future videos!\n\nDon\u0027t forget to subscribe for more videos and like this one if you found it interesting!\n\n#UnveilingMe #UnconventionalUpbringing #CultLife #Perspective\n#GetToKnowMe\n\nIG: @susancagleofficial\nFB: @susancagleofficial\nTwitter: @susanjustice\nwebsite: susancagle.com\nTikTok: @susancagle",
