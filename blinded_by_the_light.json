How is sex multi-dimensional? Fundamentalist religion represses sexuality to an unhealthy extent. We look at how breaking free of sexual dogma can release shame surrounding healthy sexuality, and how embracing our full sexual selves can be life changing. Good sexual relationships can provide a platform to learn more about needs, express vulnerability, grow deeper with our partners, and access parts of ourselves that are otherwise shamed, subdued, or dormant.",

She and I both grew up in Church Universal and Triumphant (CUT), the largest fringe religion to ever establish a presence in Montana. In the late 1980\u0027s their leader Elizabeth Prophet warned of possible nuclear war and the members entered bomb shelters in 1990 for two days to prepare for a nuclear holocaust. She was nine years old when her family went underground to prepare for the end of the world. Episode topics include: - Her experience when the members entered the bomb shelters with CUT - How does a person find their identity after leaving a cult or religion - What coping mechanisms do people have surrounding religious dogma - How do people heal from PTSD experienced in childhood surrounding spirituality? - How cognitive dissonance allows people to stay in harmful religions - How Toxic Positivity plays into the belief system - Her article in the Elephant Journal: Narcissism: Unraveling the Link between Trump, Trauma \u0026 Cult Mentality - The adoration for Trump inside the CUT membership - Why people bond to Trump as a leader Read more of Justice\u2019s deep writing at: https://www.elephantjournal.com/profile/justice-bartlett/ Or connect with her at: illuminationwithjustice.com",
