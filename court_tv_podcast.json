      "description": "PODCAST- Vinnie Politan investigates the bizarre world of Chad Daybell and Lori Vallow Daybell, commonly referred to as \u201CThe Doomsday Couple.\u201D Both faced charges in the deaths of Lori\u2019s two children, 7-year-old JJ Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan, and Chad\u2019s first wife, Tammy Daybell. Last year, Lori was convicted on conspiracy and first-degree murder charges and is serving the first of three consecutive life sentences without parole. Chad is on trial now, where prosecutors say Chad and Lori used their spiritual beliefs to cover a carefully calculated plan fueled by money, sex and power to kill those who stood in the way. Meanwhile, Chad\u2019s attorney says no evidence connects Chad to the children\u2019s murders despite their remains being discovered in his backyard. In this special podcast episode, Vinnie Politan will look back at some of the most memorable moments in his investigation into The Doomsday Couple. Lori Vallow\u2019s other brother, Adam Cox, and her uncle, Rex Conner, join Vinnie to give an inside look at Lori\u2019s complex family dynamic, the murders and Chad Daybell\u2019s trial. In the second half of this episode, Vinnie and his guests discuss the timeline of Lori and Chad\u2019s relationship and Chad\u2019s children who have stood by their father\u2019s side throughout the investigation.
