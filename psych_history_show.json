      "title": "Decoding Charles Manson",
      "description": "Since his initial arrest, the American media has been eager to dismiss Charles Manson\u0027s more arcane and non-linear musings as symptoms of mental illness, or cheap philosophizing.  But if we understand Manson for what he was, a sort of outlaw beat poet, then we can often find important disclosures hidden in his words underneath layers of metaphor and abstraction.  And when examined closely, what initially seems like gibberish can often tell us more about Manson and his crimes than the journalists interviewing him seem to realize.\n\n\nOutro title card | StefWithAnF from Pexels - https://www.pexels.com/video/swirls-and-patterns-in-colored-liquid-3864182/\n\n#mansonfamily #charlesmanson #themansonfamily #manson",

      "description": "What if I told you that the most dangerous left-wing militia group in American history was actually created by a CIA operative, fresh off of running the Phoenix Program in Vietnam?  The Symbionese Liberation Army popped up out of nowhere in 1973, with a vague ideology supposedly forged inside a prison that hosted MK Search experiments, and immediately tried to rope other Bay Area radical groups into their politically confused, violent schemes.  Was it all just entrapment targeting the radical left?  A COINTELPRO op?  Mind control gone wrong?  And if the SLA\u0027s \u0022leader\u0022 wasn\u0027t the one in control, then who was?\n\nOutro title card | StefWithAnF from Pexels | https://www.pexels.com/video/swirls-and-patterns-in-colored-liquid-3864182/\n\n#symbionese #sla #symbioneseliberationarmy #cia  #fbi #cointelpro #cult  #hippie #hippies #blackpanthers #bgf #blackliberationarmy #karenga #ronkarenga #USorg #1970s #mansonfamily #sabotage #pattyhearst",
