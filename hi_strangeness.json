      "description": "Holy smokes, Emily Louise is my guest this week! Emily is the creator of the must see Youtube Channel WEIRD READS WITH EMILY LOUISE. She is scary talented and is putting out some of the best work on the griftier (I just made up a word) side of UFOs, New Age, Cults and whole host of shady characters in these weird topics. We get into her work for HBO\u0027s Love Has Won docu-series, her research into the Montauk Project, disclosure activism and whole lot more. Folks, run, don\u0027t walk to her Youtube Channel. It\u0027s truly a treasure trove of highly entertaining, and informative material on subjects we love on this show. Please enjoy!Love, Steve Links for Emily Louise:https://www.youtube.com/@WeirdReadswithEmilyLouisepatreon.com/weirdreadsemilylouiseko-fi.com/weirdreadsemilylouisetwitter.com/Weirdreadsemilyinstagram.com/Weirdreadsemilylouise",
