      "description": "BIO\n\nIsabella Young (B.Ed., M.Ed. pre.) felt most at home in Nature from childhood. Fueled by her experiences of the healing properties of the natural world, she became a pioneer in development of therapeutic Outdoor Adventure programs in Victoria, Australia until personal tragedy struck. Widowed, pregnant, and with her young son, Isabella began a healing journey that spans three decades. She has crisscrossed three continents under three different names, undertaking pilgrimages, retreats, shamanic journeys, and vision quests. She lived in tents, tipis, and ashrams, including eight years in a messianic cult as the wife of the \u2018guru,\u2019 who groomed then murdered her son. His murder broke her free from cult programming, and she escaped to Hawaii. Through her relentless devotion to healing and seeking truth and freedom, Isabella is now thriving and writing books to share wisdom from her experiences, the Aina, and other teachers that supports optimal health, sovereignty, anarchy, and the freedom and future of Humanity.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/stores/Isabella-Young/author/B09Q7MB9MS?ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1\u0026qid=1753576207\u0026sr=8-1\u0026isDramIntegrated=true\u0026shoppingPortalEnabled=true",
