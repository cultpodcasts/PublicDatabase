This doctrine is why Native Americans had \u0022guardianships\u0022 as adults and prohibits tribes from \u0022owning\u0022 their land. It creates a perpetual view of Indigenous persons as less than, and not fully equal. As recent as 2005 the SCOTUS has upheld this doctrine in cases about Native Rights, because it is \u0022precedent\u0022. Two dozen Protestant Churches have renounced this doctrine. The first in 2013 (UCC). The ELCA in 2016. The Roman Catholic Church renounced it March 30, 2023. The legacy of this racist doctrine continues to impact people of color across the globe.

      "description": "In this episode Ray describes his experience of being homeschooled and the jarring transition from that system into community college and adult life. While homeschooling in and of itself may not be traumatizing, the lack of knowledge of resources, the reinforcement of harmful thought processes, the pressure to be a perfect Christian and the overwhelming sense of change that comes in finding a job can contribute to trauma responses in some individuals.
