      "description": "Jerald and Sandra Tanner were raised in the LDS faith, both with a strong Mormon family history. Jerald is the great-great-grandson of John Tanner, well known for his sizable financial contributions to Joseph Smith and the LDS church in 1835 when the church was deeply in debt. Sandra Tanner is a great-great-granddaughter of Brigham Young, the second president of the Mormon Church.  As teenagers, before they met, Jerald and Sandra were challenged by different people and events to examine the origins of Mormonism. Soon after their introduction, they jointly began researching Mormonism and became engaged. Both accepted Christ during these early years of study and have left the Mormon church. They are both active members of a local Christian church in Salt Lake City.  This episode explores Sandra and Jerald\u2019s early years before forming Utah Lighthouse Ministries.",

      "description": "In this podcast, Heather Olson Beal interviews three essayists who contributed to the book Mormon Women Have Their Say: Essays from the Claremont Oral History Collection: Caroline Kline (who also co-edited the book with Dr. Claudia Bushman), Anna Rolapp, and Elizabeth Mott.  In this podcast, we discuss the Claremont Women\u2019s Oral History Project in general and then discuss four essays in greater depth:  Caroline\u2019s essay on Mormon women\u2019s conceptions of the self, Anna\u2019s essay on Mormon women and California\u2019s Proposition 8, Elizabeth\u2019s essay on Mormon single women, and Caroline\u2019s essay on Mormon women\u2019s attitudes towards and feelings about patriarchy.  The Claremont Women\u2019s Oral History Project has collected hundreds of interviews with Mormon women of various ages, experiences, and levels of activity. These interviews record the experiences of these women in their homes and family life, their church life, and their work life, in their roles as homemakers, students, missionaries, career women, single women, converts, and disaffected members. Their stories feed into and illuminate the broader narrative of LDS history and belief, filling in a large gap in Mormon history that has often neglected the lived experiences of women. This project preserves and perpetuates their voices and memories, allowing them to say share what has too often been left unspoken. The silent majority speaks in these records. This volume is the first to explore the riches of the collection in print. A group of young scholars and others have used the interviews to better understand what Mormonism means to these women and what women mean for Mormonism. They explore those interviews through the lenses of history, doctrine, mythology, feminist theory, personal experience, and current events to help us understand what these women have to say about their own faith and lives.  Other essays address important topics, such as fertility, motherhood, adversity, womanliness, callings, revelation, missions, agency, the Relief Society,  and Heavenly Mother.",

      "description": "Ryan McIlvain was born in Utah and raised in Massachusetts. His fiction and nonfiction have appeared in many journals, including The Paris Review.  A graduate of the Rutgers MFA Program and a recipient of the Stegner Fellowship at Stanford, he currently lives with his wife in Los Angeles.  As part of Mormon Stories Book Club, today Heather Olson Beal and I discuss Ryan\u2019s book \u0022Elders,\u0022 which is the story of two young Mormon missionaries in Brazil and their tense, peculiar friendship.  Elder McLeod - outspoken, surly, a brash American - is nearing the end of his mission. For nearly two years he has spent his days studying the Bible and the Book of Mormon, knocking on doors, teaching missionary lessons \u0022experimenting on the word.\u0022 His new partner is Elder Passos, a devout, ambitious Brazilian who found salvation and solace in the church after his mother\u2019s early death. The two men are at first suspicious of each other, and their work together is frustrating, fruitless. That changes when a beautiful woman and her husband offer the missionaries a chance to be heard, to put all of their practice to good use, to test the mettle of their faith. But before they can bring the couple to baptism, they must confront their own long-held beliefs and doubts, and the simmering tensions at the heart of their friendship.  A novel of unsparing honesty and beauty, Elders announces Ryan McIlvain as a writer of enormous talent.",

      "description": "In Part 4, John Hamer tells the remarkable story of the RLDS Church\u2019s transformation from a inward-looking sect with a negative, exclusive identity to a progressive denomination with a positive, inclusive identity. Although both the RLDS Church and the LDS Church were faced with the same basic challenges in the societal transformation in North America after World War 2, the churches had completely opposite responses. In the wake of the challenges posed by professional scholarship of the \u0022New Mormon History,\u0022 RLDS leaders chose to \u0022embrace truth and do what is right, let the consequence follow,\u0022 rather than to retrench, deny, and retreat into territory that is intellectually indefensible. The path has not been an easy one, but it has led Community of Christ to become a church whose values include \u0022unity in diversity,\u0022 \u0022the worth of all persons,\u0022 and the principle that \u0022all are called.\u0022 Today, women serve at every level of church leadership, up to the First Presidency. Community of Christ has had apostles from Latin America, Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Pacific Islands, in addition to North America. LGBT members have full priesthood participation in North America and Australia, and in states and countries where it is legal, priesthood members may perform same-sex marriages as a sacrament in Community of Christ.",

      "description": "In Part 3, John Hamer talks about how Latter Day Saints living in the Midwest who continued to oppose polygamy were able to regroup and come together as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  These members included Joseph Smith Jr.\u2019s immediate family.  Joseph and Emma\u2019s eldest surviving son, Joseph Smith III, led the RLDS Church as prophet for 54 years.  Described by his biographer as a \u0022pragmatic prophet,\u0022 Joseph III was able to successfully weld diverse old Saints who had been Strangites, Cutlerites, Wightites, Whitermites, Rigdonites, Thompsonites, Brighamites, Morrisites, and more, into a Restoration tradition church that took the Kirtland era as its model.  The fact that Joseph III grew up in the ruins of Nauvoo and had learned to live with his neighbors influenced the Reorganization\u2019s strong peace tradition.",

John conceptually divides successor churches into three categories: (1) Those who sought to \u0022purify\u0022 the church and go back to an earlier form of Mormonism, (2) those who sought to \u0022preserve\u0022 the church as it existed in 1844, and (3) those who wanted to continue to \u0022innovate\u0022 by having a new prophet ever revealing new doctrine and practices on the model of the founder. John describes how polygamy continued to be the main point of contention and how the organizations of most of Brigham Young\u2019s rivals had faltered by 1860.",

John talks about the rapid evolution in Mormonism from its origins to 1844, its inherent tensions, and the direct causes of the schism that emerged after Brigham Young\u2019s showdown with Sidney Ridgon for church leadership in Nauvoo.",

While serving as bishop Simon began studying Native American DNA which he expected to have Middle Eastern origins, given the primary Book of Mormon narrative and longstanding church teachings to this effect.  Discovering instead that Native American DNA was almost 100% of Asiatic origin, this seriously challenged Simon\u2019s belief that the Lamanites are the ancestors of the American Indians, and that the Book of Mormon is a historical document.

A non-Mormon, Dr. Mould nonetheless became very familiar with the Mormon experience in his field work. He immersed himself in a Mormon community, attending church meetings, family home evenings, and even father/son campouts. His perspectives on how Mormons experience, share, and interpret personal revelation is fascinating for anyone interested in Mormon studies or folklore studies in general.",

But to overplay his academic bona fides is possibly a mistake, because, as this interview with longtime friend and Mormon Stories contributor Dan Wotherspoon reveals, Jim is the opposite of the stuffy scholar stereotype. In this two-part interview, his incredibly quick and inquisitive mind is on full display, but it\u2019s his good humor and ability to use observations from everyday life, great literature, and important films to elucidate powerful philosophical and religious questions that will surely captivate listeners. Among other discussions, through Jim\u0027s lenses Mormonism\u2019s fully engaged God\u2014as Sterling McMurrin described: a God with his\u0022own problems\u0022\u2014comes alive and becomes a highly compelling alternative to traditional Christian views that borrow so heavily from Greek ideas about the nature of perfection.

She divides her time between doing psychotherapy and coordinating the Stress Management and Biofeedback Services. Her interest in and experience with treating childhood sexual abuse began during her masters program in 1985 working as a volunteer counselor with AMACs (Adults Molested as Children). She received her Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology from BYU in 1997 and wrote her dissertation on adult men who had been sexually abused as children. Barbara began working in the BYU Counseling Center in 1996 and for many years was the sexual assault liaison between the center and the University Police, county law enforcement, and other agencies. Students who had been sexually assaulted were referred directly to her for immediate help and ongoing therapy. Dr. Morrell has served two LDS missions, one to Taiwan at the normal missionary age, and 10 years later she took a leave of absence from her work as a high school counselor for a second mission to Geneva Switzerland. She loves teaching in the Church and loved working for two years as a temple worker in the Provo temple.",

      "description": "Eugene England (1933\u20132001) was one of the founders and great leaders in Mormon Studies and independent Mormon discussions. He and four others founded Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, for which he served as its first editor. He was instrumental in the creation of the Association for Mormon Letters, and he is considered the champion of the \u201Cpersonal essay\u201D as a powerful form for Mormon expression. England was a peace activist, whose reflections on having been present in the Vatican during the 1981 assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II (one of the bullets nicked his hand and left a small burn on his temple as it whizzed past) led him to found \u201CFood for Poland,\u201D a large-scale effort involving students from many college campuses to provide support for the Solidarity movement when it struggling under Polish government crack downs. He was an innovative and highly influential teacher. He revamped \u201Cstudy abroad\u201D programs at both BYU and Utah Valley State College, leading to unparalleled learning experiences for students who traveled with his groups to London. He supported and was an active voice for academic freedom at BYU, championed the rise of Mormon Studies at UVSC, and was an articulate voice and active supporter for nearly every good cause in independent Mormon circles for nearly four decades. More than any of these or many other accomplishments we didn\u2019t name, however, Eugene England was a person of faith and incredible spiritual depth who, along with Leonard Arrington and Lowell Bennion, stands as an example of a committed, faithful life of intellectual and spiritual integrity, maturity, and grace even as he was often misunderstood and under-appreciated.

      "description": "Eugene England (1933\u20132001) was one of the founders and great leaders in Mormon Studies and independent Mormon discussions. He and four others founded Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, for which he served as its first editor. He was instrumental in the creation of the Association for Mormon Letters, and he is considered the champion of the \u201Cpersonal essay\u201D as a powerful form for Mormon expression. England was a peace activist, whose reflections on having been present in the Vatican during the 1981 assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II (one of the bullets nicked his hand and left a small burn on his temple as it whizzed past) led him to found \u201CFood for Poland,\u201D a large-scale effort involving students from many college campuses to provide support for the Solidarity movement when it struggling under Polish government crack downs. He was an innovative and highly influential teacher. He revamped \u201Cstudy abroad\u201D programs at both BYU and Utah Valley State College, leading to unparalleled learning experiences for students who traveled with his groups to London. He supported and was an active voice for academic freedom at BYU, championed the rise of Mormon Studies at UVSC, and was an articulate voice and active supporter for nearly every good cause in independent Mormon circles for nearly four decades. More than any of these or many other accomplishments we didn\u2019t name, however, Eugene England was a person of faith and incredible spiritual depth who, along with Leonard Arrington and Lowell Bennion, stands as an example of a committed, faithful life of intellectual and spiritual integrity, maturity, and grace even as he was often misunderstood and under-appreciated.

      "description": "Based on the success of our recent Mormon Stories Conference in New York City, we have decided to organize several local, Facebook-based communities of support for what we like to call uncorrelated (or intellectual/feminist/gay/politically liberal/inactive/post/ex) Mormons.  We have already created 32 groups, and hope to establish a support group for every major city/region in the world.  The idea behind each group will be to: 1) foster local, face-to-face communities of support for non-traditional Mormons, and 2) help to encourage healthy/constructive living amongst those for whom the traditional LDS Church experience is not adequate.  Note: this is NOT meant to replace the LDS church experience.  Instead, it is meant to augment the church experience (for those who still attend), or to provide community support for those who no longer feel comfortable attending church.  Some ideas we are hoping to foster include:  Monthly local meet-ups Book clubs/study groups Weekly play groups for children Annual youth conferences for teens College groups for Mormon university students (BYU/UVU and USU already created!) A dating service Service projects Annual conferences/retreats Etc. If you are interested in any of this, please check out our existing groups for a group near you.  If you would like to start your own local support group, please email us at: mormonstories@gmail.com",

      "description": "In this 2-part discussion, KC Kern (BookofMormonOnline.Net) speaks with Dr. Grant Hardy and his wife Heather Hardy.  Grant Hardy is Professor of History and Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina at Asheville. He has a B.A. in Ancient Greek from Brigham Young University and  Ph.D. in Chinese Language and Literature from Yale. He has authored Worlds of Bronze and Bamboo: Sima Qian\u2019s Conquest of History; The Establishment of the Han Empire and Imperial China; and Understanding the Book of Mormon: A Reader\u2019s Guide, as well as the Introduction for Royal Skousen\u2019s recent Yale edition of the Book of Mormon. He has also edited The Book of Mormon: A Reader\u2019s Edition; Enduring Ties: Poems of Family Relationships; and the Oxford History of Historical Writing. Vol. 1. His 36-lecture DVD/CD course for The Teaching Company entitled \u201CGreat Minds of the Eastern Intellectual Tradition\u201D will be released this summer.   Heather Hardy has a BS and an MBA from Brigham Young University (she says the latter seemed like a good idea when Grant was studying Greek; someone was going to have to support the family someday). She worked in university finances at Yale and then as the scholarship coordinator at BYU for a couple of years. She has published articles in Dialogue and the Journal of Book of Mormon Studies, but is mostly a full-time reader masquerading as a stay-at-home mother. Grant and Heather have been married for 28 years and have been talking to each other non-stop the whole time.  This interview is broken in two parts: Part 1:  Introductions, early personal, academic, and scholarly experiences, and approaching the Book of Mormon as world scripture and literature. Part 2:  Understanding the Book of Mormon: A Reader\u2019s Guide, thoughts on narrative structures, phraseology, historicity, evidences, anachronisms, Book of Mormon usage in the LDS Church, and on balancing faith and reason.",

      "description": "In this episode, John Dehlin interviews one of his former professors and mentors, Dr. William Bradshaw, on a wide variety of topics. Dr. Bradshaw has just recently retired from a rich and fulfilling career as a microbiology professor at BYU in which he influenced thousands of students to continually be open to the best thinking of the sciences while still nurturing a robust, mature faith and spiritual life. Many report Dr. Bradshaw\u2019s classes and their various interactions with him as pivotal to their finding a way to value the wisdom generated in both their heads and their hearts.  In this far-ranging discussion, Dr. Bradshaw takes us through the arc of his life, including his mission, experiences at Harvard, the circumstances of his career choice, and the surprise call he and his wife Marge received to serve as very young mission presidents in Hong Kong, during which service they had to wrestle with opening and closing missionary work in Vietnam. Dr. Bradshaw relates stories from his career at BYU, talks about science and religion issues, and reveals the way he faces challenges to his faith from Mormon history and scriptural studies.  Many Mormon Stories podcast listeners will already be familiar with one aspect of Dr. Bradshaw\u2019s life from Episode 191, which featured a recording of the most recent lecture he gave at BYU on the biological origins of homosexuality--a lecture he has arranged and given every year for the past several years. Dr. Bradshaw first became prompted to study the research on this subject when his son Brett came out about his homosexuality. Since that time, the Bradshaws have been active members in various LDS groups for families working to support their GLBT children. They are currently serving as the presidents of LDS Family Fellowship. Brett and his partner are married and living in California, where they are raising an adopted daughter.",

      "description": "In this episode, John Dehlin interviews one of his former professors and mentors, Dr. William Bradshaw, on a wide variety of topics. Dr. Bradshaw has just recently retired from a rich and fulfilling career as a microbiology professor at BYU in which he influenced thousands of students to continually be open to the best thinking of the sciences while still nurturing a robust, mature faith and spiritual life. Many report Dr. Bradshaw\u2019s classes and their various interactions with him as pivotal to their finding a way to value the wisdom generated in both their heads and their hearts.  In this far-ranging discussion, Dr. Bradshaw takes us through the arc of his life, including his mission, experiences at Harvard, the circumstances of his career choice, and the surprise call he and his wife Marge received to serve as very young mission presidents in Hong Kong, during which service they had to wrestle with opening and closing missionary work in Vietnam. Dr. Bradshaw relates stories from his career at BYU, talks about science and religion issues, and reveals the way he faces challenges to his faith from Mormon history and scriptural studies.  Many Mormon Stories podcast listeners will already be familiar with one aspect of Dr. Bradshaw\u2019s life from Episode 191, which featured a recording of the most recent lecture he gave at BYU on the biological origins of homosexuality--a lecture he has arranged and given every year for the past several years. Dr. Bradshaw first became prompted to study the research on this subject when his son Brett came out about his homosexuality. Since that time, the Bradshaws have been active members in various LDS groups for families working to support their GLBT children. They are currently serving as the presidents of LDS Family Fellowship. Brett and his partner are married and living in California, where they are raising an adopted daughter.",

      "description": "Dan Wotherspoon interviews Allen D. Roberts and Curt Bench about the lasting legacy of Mormon forger, con man, and murderer Mark Hofmann.  Exactly twenty-five years ago, on the morning of 15 October 1985, Salt Lake City was rattled\u2014both literally and psychologically\u2014by the explosion of two bombs which each killed a person. The next day brought a third explosion, nearly killing Mark Hofmann, a well-known dealer in Mormon documents. Because of clues at that scene, investigators soon realized that perhaps Hofmann was not so much a third victim but the person actually responsible for all three bombs. In the course of the investigation, the tale of Mark Hofmann as a master forger and con artist began to unfold.  In this podcast, we examine the long and complex legacy of these murders and forgeries, as well as their continued reverberations even today. Although it is still unclear if Hofmann\u2019s intent was to bring down Mormonism through creating documents that challenged traditional presentations of early Church origins, he definitely was a serious student of Mormon history and knew where various controversies lay\u2014which he then exploited through the forged letters and documents he produced. This case has also presented challenges to some Latter-day Saints because of Hofmann\u2019s various meetings with Mormon general authorities who failed to detect that he was deceiving them, as well as because of the Church\u2019s practice of sometimes obtaining controversial documents and then suppressing them.  Joining Mormon Stories host Dan Wotherspoon to tell the story of these tragic murders and complex issues are two terrific guests: Allen Roberts, who co-authored with Linda Sillitoe the book Salamander: The Story of the Mormon Forgery Murders, which is widely regarded as the most thorough account of the Hofmann saga, and Curt Bench, who at the time of the bombings managed the Fine and Rare Books department of Deseret Book\u2019s flagship store in downtown Salt Lake City in which he dealt regularly with Mark Hofmann and even considered him a friend. Linda, Allen, and Curt all ended up playing important roles in helping investigators ultimately make their case against Hofmann and untangle the threads that had led him to murder.",

      "description": "Richard Dutcher burst into Mormon cultural consciousness ten years ago with the release of his independent film hit, God\u2019s Army. During the ensuing decade, he has remained an intriguing figure to many Latter-day Saints, not only because of the high quality of the films he has continued to make, but also because of his public distancing himself from Mormon cinema, a film genre launched primarily because of his successes, as well as his more private (yet also public) distancing himself from the LDS Church and its teachings.        In this five-part interview conducted by Mormon Stories correspondent Dan Wotherspoon, Richard Dutcher speaks with remarkable candor about his upbringing and marriage, his career as a filmmaker, including extensive comments about each of his completed films (as well as ones, such as his planned film on Joseph Smith, that have not yet been made), the rise and decline of Mormon cinema, and his own faith journey.        This interview is available in both audio and high-quality video formats. The video version includes scenes from Dutcher\u2019s films that play over the interview audio.",

Throughout the interview and via Richard\u0027s own personal story, we explore 3 ways in which the LDS Church creates unnecessary enemies: 1) By not being honest about its own history (e.g. teaching accurate history), 2) By breaking up families (when one no longer believes), and 3) By  harming the loved ones of those who have left the church.        To conclude (part 4), Richard discusses the benefits of religious belief in general and the LDS church specifically, along with the mission of the ExMormon foundation, and bears a final testimony regarding the joy/happiness he has experienced since leaving the church.         NOTE: The purpose of this interview is NOT to encourage people to stay or leave the LDS church.  It is simply to: 1) Seek to understand and to validate the path of those who have felt compelled to leave the church, and    2) Explore ways in which the church can seek to no longer create unnecessary enemies.",

      "description": "Janet Bennion is an associate professor of anthropology, specializing in alternative sexuality in nontraditional religious movements in the Intermountain West, specifically among Mormon fundamentalist polygynists. She has a Ph.D. in Anthropology from University of Utah and a Masters in Social Organization from Portland State University.        Her doctoral expertise lies in cross-cultural perspectives of sexuality, gender and society, and women of the fundamentalist world.         Her scientific publications include two major ethnographic works and two comparative analyses of Mormon polygynous women, as well as many peer-review journal articles. Women of Principle: Female Networking in Contemporary Mormon Polygyny (Oxford University Press 1998) offers an in-depth study of gender roles and sexual norms in the Apostolic United Brethren sect in the Bitterroot Mountains of Montana, cataloging women\u0027s conversion stories. This ethnography shows that while abuses do exist, some women achieve ironic ascendance and satisfaction in fundamentalism. Desert Patriarchy (University of Arizona Press 2004) presents her theory explaining the role of the desert environment (Chihuahua, Mexico) in the development and maintenance of a patriarchal gender ideology. Her model identifies several factors -- male supremacy, female network, non-secular education, imbalanced sex ratios, alternative sexuality, and circumscription -- which work to facilitate the longevity of desert patriarchal communities.",

      "description": "In early 1994 the distinguished career of Richard D. Poll, historian, professor, writer, husband and friend, came full circle. His Liahona/Iron-rod dichotomy, borrowed from the Book of Mormon, had entered the lexicon of Mormon thought almost 30 years earlier in his landmark essay\u0022What the Church Means to People Like Me\u0022 (Dialogue 2:4, Winter 1967). His\u0022Pillars of My Faith\u0022 sermon in Sunstone called for committed LDS worshipers and writers to join a mighty Christian chorus\u0022in which almost all the singers hear the dissonant sounds of the alternate voices as polyphonic enrichment of the message of the gospel music.\u0022 For people like him,\u0022neither dogmatic fundamentalism nor dogmatic humanism provides convincing answers to life\u0027s most basic questions.\u0022 He defined history as\u0022human strivings to discover divine realities.\u0022 Like Paul, Richard Poll lived his life as part of the leaven that\u0022leaveneth the whole lump\u0022 (Galatians 5:9), offering his Liahona questioning in the spirit of\u0022charity, humility, persistence.\u0022 In a time when men and women are being called sinners for a word (or many words); when the terms\u0022alternate\u0022 and\u0022dissident\u0022 are being redefined as sinister; when some seek apostasy, while others have apostasy thrust upon them, Richard Poll\u0027s calm, reasoned, compassionate voice rings with a clarity that will live on in our hearts and minds.",

It began the decade clearly rooted in the sectarian world view. But by the end of the decade, many of the church\u0027s leaders and a reasonable number of its members had adopted liberal views, down-playing traditional unique Latter Day Saint doctrines.

The pamphlet is entitled God Loveth His Children, and, among other things, says that the Church does not know what causes same-sex attractions but does not believe sexual abuse and sexual experimentation in childhood are responsible. It declares that same-sex attractions are not considered sinful but affirms that acting on those attractions is incompatible with God\u2019s plan for families in the afterlife. It urges same-sex attracted LDS members to remain active in the church and asks other members to treat them with love and respect.

There is hope \u2014 and perhaps more writing, meaningful projects and steely determination are key ingredients.If you happen enjoy/appreciate Claudia\u2019s interviews, please do email me so I can pass the word along.  I\u2019m quite sure Dr. Bushman will appreciate hearing from you.",

      "description": "Today it is time to hear from one of the foremost voices on Women\u0027s Issues within Mormonism: Dr. Claudia Bushman. Dr. Bushman is a historian by training, and has taught at Columbia University for many years. She is the author of several books and articles, including:\u0022Mormon Sisters: Women of Early Utah\u0022 and\u0022Mormon Domestic Life in the 1870s: Pandemonium or Acadia\u0022. Perhaps most significantly, Dr. Bushman is one of the founders of Exponent II, a Boston-based magazine and now blog focused on feminism and women\u0027s issues within Mormonism. In this interview with Dr. Bushman, we learn what she means when she describes herself as a Mormon Feminist. She also recounts her involvement in the formation of Exponent II, as well as in the broader area of women\u0027s issues in the LDS church. To conclude, Dr. Bushman discusses her views on the critical role of women in the church today -- and how we, as a church, might work to better accommodate, and better utilize women in the 21st century.",

McKay presented a dramatic contrast to his predecessors: an athletic, movie-star-handsome, clean-shaven figure who often wore a white double-breasted suit; contrasted to the dark-suited, bearded polygamists (or, in the case of George Albert Smith, son of a polygamist) who preceded him as Church President ever since Joseph Smith. In an age prior to professional image-makers, he instinctively grasped the importance of appearance, and coupled it to the substance of a professional educator to become an icon of Mormonism whose persona did much to change the negative image of the Church in much of the world.",

Today we claim 12\u002B million in the Church, but truth be told, less than 1/2 of them actually consider themselves Mormon....and thus the reason why activity rates are so closely guarded.",
