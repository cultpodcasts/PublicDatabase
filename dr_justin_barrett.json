While the presentation is playful, the implications are serious: these tactics show up not just in fringe religious movements, but also in influencer culture, politics, fandoms, and more. Learn what to watch out for\u2014and why psychological literacy matters more than ever in the digital age.\n\nFollow Justin Barrett:\n\nWebsite: https://blueprint1543.org/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-barrett-45a5b6173/\n\nTimestamps\n00:00 \u2013 \uD83C\uDFAD Mystery and Manipulation\n00:38 \u2013 \uD83D\uDCD8 Source Material \u0026 Motivation\n01:44 \u2013 \u26A0\uFE0F Cults: Definitions and Cautions\n03:21 \u2013 \uD83D\uDCCA Not All Influence Is Cultish\n03:50 \u2013 \uD83E\uDDE0 #1: Create Your Own Reality\n05:54 \u2013 \uD83E\uDD84 #2: Promise a Phantom Goal\n07:34 \u2013 \uD83D\uDD75\uFE0F #3: Be Vague and Mysterious\n08:10 \u2013 \uD83D\uDD17 #4: Be the Only Link to the Prize\n08:45 \u2013 \uD83E\uDDB8 #5: Create a Mythology\n09:48 \u2013 \uD83E\uDE9C #6: Use Incremental Commitment\n10:56 \u2013 \uD83D\uDCE2 #7: Encourage Converts to Convert Others\n11:49 \u2013 \uD83D\uDCA4 #8: Disrupt Clear Thinking\n13:16 \u2013 \uD83E\uDD10 #9: Teach Self-Censorship\n13:51 \u2013 \uD83C\uDFB6 #10: Manipulate Emotions\n14:25 \u2013 \uD83D\uDCA1 #11: Piggyback on Familiar Themes\n16:04 \u2013 \uD83D\uDCC8 #12: Always Be Growing\n16:38 \u2013 \uD83E\uDD14 Wrap-Up: Influence Isn\u2019t Always Evil\n17:08 \u2013 \uD83D\uDED1 Final Word: Don\u2019t Try This at Home",
