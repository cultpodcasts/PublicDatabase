      "description": "We\u0027re back to season 5, folks, and i\u0027m tagging in some help. I\u0027ll be honest, I was planning on taking a break from collaborations for a bit, but then this episode was a struggle for me right away. The Brown teenagers (or a few of them) go to meet with and help Holding out Help, the organization that helps former polygamists and cult members escape and establish their new lives. Well, we all know a lot more about these things than we did when this first aired. So Melanie and Cory of Notes to Self 444 (themselves former members of the Browns\u0027 sect the AUB) were kind enough to come on and help me understand what\u0027s all going on beneath the surface here. To me it\u0027s the most enlightening podcast i\u0027ve ever done, thanks to them, so I hope you enjoy. Notes to Self on Youtube. Notes to Self on TikTok. Notes to Self on Instagram.
