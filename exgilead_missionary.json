      "description": "This is the first of a new series of videos that takes a critical look at the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses doctrines related to chronology. The series will look at 1914, 1919, 1932, 1938, 1944, and prophetic periods such as the 1260, 1290, and 1335 day periods in Daniel.\r\n\r\nThis first video introduces the concept of 1919 and demonstrates what Gilead taught about it, using the Watchtower Library CD-ROM. Follow along with your copy, and test out what the Society teaches for yourself.",
