      "description": "As I\u0027m working out guests for the podcast and getting the schedules to line up, I\u0027ve also been reflecting on this idea of healing through truth-telling. I want more of that healing. I\u0027m greedy. I want to be free. I yearn for freedom from the tendrils and chains of what those cultists did to me - WHILE at the same time, I\u0027m grateful for the hardship that led me to become a deeply happy and blessed person. So I reflect on all that in this episode. Stay with me! And if you\u0027re enjoying this, please review or rate and share.",

      "description": "Back in January of 2020, before all the crazy, I was contacted by Bob Smietana, who was then the Editor-in-Chief of Religion News Service, a rather impressive and wonderful news outlet that reports on the religious angle of all the newsworthy stuff going down. Bob had found this podcast and was interested in discussing my childhood and experiences and we ended up doing an interview some weeks later. He also talked to my dad and sister. The article ultimately came out on October 14 and you can find it here: https://religionnews.com/2020/10/14/process-church-final-judgment-best-friends-animal-rescue-foundation-faith-jared-garett-latter-day-saint-cult-scientology-satanist-pet-rescue/ I shared it around and had some fascinating reactions. First off, it sounds like my dad and a few other former members aren\u0027t happy with how \u0027Satanist\u0027 the cult sounds. Additionally, there\u0027s at least one factual error. More importantly, one of the guys I grew up with got Facebook-angry and I wound up doing an informal poll of others that I grew up with regarding how we grew up. Turns out we have very different takes on our experience. I\u0027ll address all of these things in this episode, as well as share my own thoughts as I read my own words and experience as filtered through a very good journalist\u0027s brain and writing. As ever, please consider supporting this podcast in any of several ways: clicking on the support link, reviewing, telling your friends, and sharing with your family at your holiday gatherings! And on your snapchat. And Tik Tok. And all the things.",

I considered writing them all down, but didn\u0027t want to go to the effort. So I recorded an episode. This one is me being a little less guarded than usual. Not out of vindictiveness, but truth has to be spoken. Not \u0027my truth\u0027 either - just actual truth. And keep talking about this thing. Studies show that podcasts gain new listeners primarily and almost solely through word of mouth. Studies also show that cake is a great breakfast.

      "description": "Remember that episode I did on what the cult actually believed? Well, my knowledge was far more incomplete than it is now. I received a bunch of material from the director of a documentary about the Process. His name is Neil Edwards and the documentary is called Sympathy for the Devil: The True Story of the Process Church of the Final Judgment. He sent me some interesting stuff in the same package as a DVD copy of the documentary that I ordered. If you\u0027re interested, Google that title and you\u0027ll see it. Anyway, I had to do an episode on all the stuff. What they believed. The popular pseudo occult science they preached which was extremely hip at the time and... Gah. Just listen to me ramble and read if you\u0027re interested. I get a bit.. warm and probably hypocritical. Oh well, what\u0027re you gonna do? It was a cult, and that\u0027s no good. In the episode, I promise to give you a link to where you can see the images I talk about. I put them on my Facebook page: Jared Nathan Garrett . Please remember to review and support the podcast!",

Also, I talked a lot about how important books were to me, but I don\u0027t think I emphasized the power and importance of music in my formative years. It provided unfettered exhilaration and pretend and I will always be thankful to it. I recently rediscovered an artist and album and it took me to a place I was delighted to revisit. Anyway, I\u0027m finding parts of myself even today - things that have been and will be a part of me forever. And I\u0027m coming to terms with that. So tune in and hear me rave and tell more stories. Thanks for listening. As always, I\u0027d love it if you would tell friends about this crazy podcast. And review and rate it! Maybe tell three friends, and if those three friends told three friends, and so on and so on - well, that\u0027s what an MLM is, my friends.",

And I learned and was changed fundamentally. This episode shares some of the more impactful stories from my mission and you will be able to see how this experience provided everything I had wanted my whole life. Sincerity, genuine faith, and things that in my old cynical mind I considered cheesy and dumb. Now I believe they\u0027re those cheesy things- those sincere things, are the treasure of this world and life. That is entirely because of my mission. Enjoy.",

That said, we\u0027re winding up this big arc and the podcast is going to come to an end soon - with some epilogues here and there over the next few months or so. This episode is where I share anecdotes and situations and funny and even important experiences in my immediately post-cult life. In fact, I share the story of my very first actual girlfriend. And frankly, I\u0027ll never not be grateful to the people of Kanab, Utah, for being warm, welcoming, and just exactly weird enough for me as I fought to find my feet.

I made my choices all the way along and those choices helped me get out of the negative, abusive situation and start healing.

Something like this world is an illusion, so everything we do is an attempt to break the illusion. Or our existence is a simulation. Or animals are the actual gods. Or something else. But the Foundation Faith of God didn\u0027t really, in my experience, have a single uniting doctrine. I explore more about this, why it was the case, and more about the evolution of the cult/commune from Scientology offshoot to, ultimately, the very productive and wonderful Best Friends Animal Society.

But that wasn\u0027t my end form, friends. That was me in embryo, and this story is the story of me breaking free. At least a little. So join me at high school dances full of bangs and perms.

And talking about being essentially erased over and over again by the people who \u0027raised\u0027 me was necessary- because voices will be heard. I will be heard. There appears to be a little anger left in the basement, which I\u0027d like to excise, so this episode was even therapeutic. Please understand, my intent is not to tear down or deliver a scathing indictment or even to write an expos\u00E9 of the organization the cult has become. I admire their work. But I can admire their work and want it to continue and still speak the truth. We were there. They had us, abandoned us, used us to do hard labor, and neglected and even abused many of us. All that mixed in with plenty of good times. Truth needs to be spoken. I have committed to not live a life of fear. So I spoke the truth- with no animosity for anyone.",

      "description": "So glad you\u0027re back for more! Here I talk about what many of us cult kids talked a lot about: parents. We were raised as if parents were not needed, although that experience varied due to prestige of one\u0027s actual parents. Many of us were lied to about at least one parent. Why? Good question. A few anecdotes and some speculation await you in this episode. Please consider sharing and reviewing. These two things make all the difference for small podcast like mine.",
