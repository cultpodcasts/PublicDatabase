Led by Jim Baker (No, not THAT Jim Baker), a man with a sordid violent past, we delve into journey that led to them to be a cult. Starting off as a sort of hippie commune that evolved out of a vegan restaurant, it didn\u0027t take long for it to become a full blown cult, with Baker declaring himself Father Yod, and later Yahowa, and having a concubine of young girls as his wives. Some folks who regularly went to the restaurant that inspired The Source Family include John Lennon, Julie Christie, and Marlon Brando.\u0022",
