      "description": "Nolubabalo Mcinga has just shaken South African politics to its core with explosive claims about the Africa Mayibuye Movement. In a fiery address, she called it \u201Csomething worse than a cult\u201D \u2014 a one-man operation run entirely by Floyd Nyiko Shivambu. Mcinga alleges that the promises that drew her into the movement \u2014 a salary, VIP protection, and influence \u2014 all came directly from Shivambu, not the organisation. Her remarks raise serious questions about leadership, transparency, and the recurring culture of political personality worship in South Africa.\n\nThis revelation strikes at the heart of Shivambu\u2019s political credibility, given his past criticism of Julius Malema and the EFF for being too centralised. Now, Mcinga paints him as the very type of leader he once condemned \u2014 a man building a personal empire under the guise of revolution. As the Africa Mayibuye Movement tries to position itself as a new force, this controversy could spell its end before it even begins.\n\nWhat do you think \u2014 is Mcinga exposing the truth, or is this political revenge disguised as honesty? Could Floyd Shivambu survive such a damaging accusation, or is his new political brand already collapsing? Join the conversation below and share your thoughts.
