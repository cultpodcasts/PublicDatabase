      "description": "Among the myriad New Age to Jesus Testimony videos on YouTube, a strange commonality presents itself. Steven Bancarz, an ex new ager who turned to Christianity, offering compelling advice on what to do with occult objects and how to cleanse your home of occult spirits. In this video we ask the question \u0027Is This Man Radicalising True Believers?\u0027\n\nAlso, yes, I am aware that he\u0027s not the only one telling people to do this, but there are enough unique features to this situation that it warranted special attention and it provided a worthwhile lens through which to look at certain pertinent things within our society.\n\n\uD83D\uDD14 Subscribe for more videos on cults and skepticism: https://www.youtube.com/user/AndeyTheFellowes?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u2764\uFE0F Become a patron: https://www.patreon.com/AndeyFellowes\n\n\uD83D\uDD25 Grab your channel merch here: https://teespring.com/stores/andey-fellowes\n\n-*-*-*-\n\n\uD83D\uDD14 Subscribe to Germ on Mentally Diseased: https://www.youtube.com/c/MentallyDiseased?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\uD83D\uDD25 Watch Germ\u0027s videos on Demons in the Jehovah\u0027s Witness cult: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqxX5exI8Ls \n\n-*-*-*-\n\n\u2714\uFE0F Join Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/2419994311556861/\n\n\u2714\uFE0F Join Discord Server: https://discordapp.com/invite/fKMhqzV\n\n\uD83D\uDD25 Follow me -\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/andeythefellow\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/andeyfellowes\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/andeyfellowesblog\n\n\u2714\uFE0F Watch Next:\n\nAbout My Former Cult (Teal Swan Cult/Teal Tribe): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVPWy3pctDske_mQ5T5clckZjAZy5X0lQ\n\nReacting to my Old Videos - from when I was a New Ager: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVPWy3pctDslyQukC84qF3kIZQh5ejBYM\n\nNew Age Nonsense \u0026 Other Cults: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVPWy3pctDsnWSU-NGWh8ezfR8AvugFto\n\nExploring How Cults Work: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVPWy3pctDsnX-kcq8EgqzJKr3pmvnVSf \n\n-*-*-*-*-\n\n\uD83D\uDCA1 Resources on Cults: https://bitemodelanalysis.wordpress.com/resources/\n\n-*-*-*-\n\nSources:\n\nTab\u2019s Testimony: https://youtu.be/xrQ3inAwSbw \n\nPaige\u2019s Testimony Part 1:https://youtu.be/Kft4plo9JSw \n\nPaige\u2019s Testimony Part 2: https://youtu.be/k1TKQ34yqSw \n\nFox5NY Clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpJjf2ZIsjo \n\nDoreen Virtue Interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgUDwzlF_KU \nSpirit Science and Metaphysics becomes Reasons for Jesus: https://reasonsforjesus.com/the-death-of-spirit-science-metaphysics/\n \nSteven\u2019s New Age to Jesus testimony: https://youtu.be/cMu5F2icsT8 \n\nProof The New Age Movement Is Satanic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtkGgtExLcY \n\nOccult Objects In Your House Give Demons Legal Ground: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC6TVczb8Uc \n\nRadicalisation and Recruiting: https://www.fpri.org/article/2017/09/isis-recruiting-not-just-ideological/\n\nMoral Shock: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_shock\n\nJasper M.

So, for me, coming across people fervently asserting that there is a god just didn\u0027t happen that often. As a result, I grew up without any real faith. And, until I got into a cult, that\u0027s pretty much how it was for me - with a few exceptions. \n\nNOTE: I forgot to talk about the time I tried to read the bible. I got bored really quickly. I was about 13/14 and I came away with the conviction that, as far as books go, the bible is badly written. It\u0027s an irreverent position that i occasionally wheel out to wind theists up even today.\n\n-*-*-*-*-*-\n\nBecome a patron: https://www.patreon.com/AndeyFellowes\n\nFollow me -\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/andeythefellow\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/andeyfellowes\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/andeyfellowesblog\n\nJoin Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/2419994311556861/\n\nJoin Discord Server: https://discordapp.com/invite/fKMhqzV\n\n-*-*-*-*-*-",
