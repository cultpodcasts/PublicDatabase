Chad and Lori Daybell appear to have been convinced that the end of times was approaching and that dark spirits were taking over the souls of various people in their lives. They purportedly believed that the dark spirits were turning people into zombies and that they needed to \u0022eliminate,\u0022 or kill those people to save their souls. His trial is slated to last ten weeks. In her separate trial, Lori Vallow Daybell has been convicted and sentenced to life in prison without parole in the deaths of her two children and for conspiring to murder her husband\u0027s previous wife (Tammy)\n\n***All content in this video is intended for purposes of news reporting and commentary only.***\n\n\u25BA Watch the full video on Law \u0026 Crime website: https://www.youtube.com/@UCz8K1occVvDTYDfFo7N5EZw\n\n\u25BA Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFQss8CTxsMtXbhuWWF8PA/join\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKatherine Lizardo, Esq. is a regular Legal Analyst for Law \u0026 Crime Network every Friday.
