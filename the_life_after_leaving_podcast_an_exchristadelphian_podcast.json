      "description": "Today we\u2019re chatting with Brian! Brian is our first guest to come on the podcast from the Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith (COGAF). While they technically have a different name than Christadelphians, the groups were founded by former associates at about the same time. Members of COGAF hold the same beliefs as Christadelphians, fellowship with them, and even attend Christadelphian activities, camps, and bible schools! In today\u2019s episode, we hear about Brian\u2019s former ecclesia using pancakes to convince people to attend services, about that time he was brought to Jamaica for a school project to learn about the life of Christadelphian missionaries as a teenager, and about the \u201Cwave theory\u201D of doubt and faith that eventually washed him ashore to solid ground without faith in God. We also chat about surprise ambushes by Christadelphians who create confrontations about faith and church attendance in the most unexpected times and places. Please join us for another episode of fellowship among those who have left the fold! If you have any questions that you would like addressed in the upcoming episode on religious trauma, please email \u2060lifeafterleavingpodcast@gmail.com\u2060 Listener discretion advised.

      "description": "Today we\u2019re flipping the script and Heather is chatting with Zinnia! Zinnia shares her story of growing up as an undiagnosed neurodivergent child and being bullied during her childhood inside and outside of the ecclesia. The first half of this episode is a bit heavy as Zinnia discusses how her environment contributed to severe depression and how growing up in a high control environment among other factors may have groomed her for domestic violence in her relationships. However, things took a turn for the better when Zinnia chose to leave the group, shut down their harassment, reported perpetrators to the police. She also reclaimed her life and her voice by changing her name, moving out on her own, creating a new environment where she could thrive in secular friendships and relationships, and connecting with other ex-Christadelphians in the Facebook community. She also shares her story of living in a haunted apartment, explains why she is skeptical of Christadelphians claiming that they\u2019ll report the criminal activity of other Christadelphians, and about the circumstances that led her to create this podcast. This episode was also released alongside Episode 13 on Spiritualism due to some overlapping themes and topics. We hope you enjoy this podcast double feature! See you in 2025! Also, thank you to Heather for editing this episode!

      "description": "Today we\u2019re chatting about ghosts! More specifically, about how the Christadelphians have historically tried to disprove the existence of ghosts and the beliefs of Spiritualists to their followers! It\u2019s time for science class with John Thomas as he explains the (now considered pseudoscience) \u0022science\u0022 of odology, explains how Jesus Christ (electric medium) used hypnosis on his disciples, speculates on whether followers will be able to be invisible and teleport when they\u2019re resurrected (sorry, you can only hold eyeballs), and how God\u2019s Holy Spirit is actually\u2026 electricity. We discover the story of a Christadelphian with psychic abilities and end the episode with the most legendary ghost story to ever be told in Christadelphia! It\u2019s going to get spoooooooky! This episode was also released alongside Episode 14, Fellowship with Zinnia, due to some overlapping themes and topics. We hope you enjoy this podcast double feature! See you in 2025!

In this episode, Paul shares his story of joining the Christadelphians with his parents as a young convert, to stirring up trouble in the capital city as a young man handing out pamphlets on the Holy Spirit, to eventually not only leaving the Christadelphians, but eventually becoming an atheist studying theology! Paul also shares his controversial experience giving his one and only public lecture as a Christadelphian, his time as part of a group of Christadelphians nicknamed \u201Cthe four horsemen of the apocalypse\u201D, and about his thesis project on the roots of Christianity which he started after going back to school *again*. There\u2019s no box big enough to fit Paul into as he\u2019s explored careers, countries, and theology throughout his lifetime. I hope you enjoy this episode and hearing about the twists and turns of his fascinating life!

Luke shares his experience growing up in a small, insular ecclesia disconnected from the wider community of Christadelphians and singing the same hymns every week. In this episode, we\u2019ll hear about his process of trying to fit into the wider Christadelphian world after growing up in isolation, about his first experience attending an ecclesia that drank Christ\u2019s blood from a shared cup (ew), and on the pressure to leave his new ecclesia and to end his relationship with a non-Christadelphian. We also speculate on his prospects of an American speaking tour, argue for Australia to have its own major winter holiday, and wonder if Christadelphian music will ever be a topic for a pub trivia night at last!?

Mako and Zinnia discuss the experiences shared by some ex-Christadelphians about beards and compare it to the historical views of Christadelphians during the time of Doctor John Thomas and Robert Roberts.

Mike shares his story of growing up in the Brotherhood with many surprises including sourcing bootleg copies of the Simpsons for the Christadelphian youth group, finding a wife at the Christadelphian nursing home, and about his path to eventually becoming \u201Cunequally yoked\u201D before leaving the group. Mike also shares his experience of unintentionally framing the Editor of the Christadelphian magazine for vandalism (whoops) and answers whether or not he saw any unattached beard hair in the Christadelphian Magazine Archives. And of course, he asks the hard hitting questions such as \u201D...have you got a hat?\u201D. Please join us for yet another fun episode of fellowship among the heathens!

In this episode, we\u2019ll be taking a critical look at whether this famous Christadelphian leader was actually just a follower. I\u2019ll be sharing with you \u201Crespectable heathens\u201D stories about Robert Roberts\u2019 childhood, his quirks, and the chance he missed to leave behind the drama of the Christadelphians forever. I hope you\u2019re as surprised as I was to learn the bizarre ways that he honored John Thomas throughout his lifetime, and even in death. I\u2019ll also share a Christadelphian exhortation drinking game, a request for the whereabouts of a lost object, and a story about a legendary exhortation at the Moorestown ecclesia. Please also stay tuned to the end for another \u201Cad\u201D from one of our \u201Csponsors\u201D.
