      "description": "Today we\u2019re chatting with Chloe! In this episode, Chloe shares her experience being raised to be homeschooled by Christadelphians and sent to a Canadian Christadelphian Heritage College before being discouraged from pursuing higher education and having to learn how to navigate the \u201Coutside world\u201D once she hit adulthood. We also discuss mental health issues she experienced while she was a Christadelphian, how the Arranging Brothers refused to accept her resignation, and her method of using note taking to lure in a godly man. Chloe also shares her childhood ghost stories, discusses the anxious thoughts she had about the \u201CKingdom of God\u201D, and opens up about the peer pressure around her baptism. We also ask, why would we ever want to be like the angels? Why is it so hard to develop close relationships as a Christadelphian? And how can we get the best roast dinner recipes now that we\u2019ve left?\u00A0\n\u00A0\nPlease join us for another episode of fellowship among the Heathens!\n\u00A0\n*Please note that we had a technical difficulty about 58 minutes in which interrupted the conversation, whoops!\n\u00A0\nListener discretion advised.\u00A0\n\u00A0\nResources and References:\n\u00A0\nGay the Pray Away by Natalie Naudus\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/209563856-gay-the-pray-away\n\u00A0\nCultish: The Language of Fanaticism by Amanda Montell\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55338982-cultish\n\u00A0\nThought Terminating Cliches:\u00A0\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought-terminating_clich%C3%A9\n\u00A0\nhttps://psychology.org.au/about-us/news-and-media/aps-in-the-media/2024/explaining-thought-terminating-cliches-and-why-we\n\u00A0\nCult Signs- Keeping Members Busy and Exhausted:\n\u201C#11 Time Domination- Members are kept constantly busy to prevent independent thinking\u201D\nhttps://blog.earkick.com/25-signs-youre-in-a-cult-how-cult-leaders-keep-you-hooked/\n\u00A0\n\u201CIf you experience pressure to take part in any (or all) services, rites or rituals, and feel it would be socially costly not to take part (i.e. you might be excluded from other things, disapproved of or left out of friendship groups), you should be concerned.\u201D\nhttps://secularliturgies.wordpress.com/2020/02/24/the-25-signs-youre-in-a-high-control-group-or-cult-by-anastasia-somerville-wong/\n\u00A0\nNeville Goddard\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neville_Goddard\n\u00A0\nHarry Potter and Apparating:\nhttps://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Apparition\n\u00A0\nHistory episode mentioning \u2018being like the angels\u2019: Episode 13: Hypnosis, Telepathy and Ghosts\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/6s3SJuLRYSk1QNWK8vY7fm?si=4d187dddb9f147e3\n\u00A0\nEx-Christadelphian website:\nhttps://www.ex-christadelphians.com/p/ex-christadelphians-support.html\n\u00A0\nEar Biscuits Podcast: Rhett\u2019s Spiritual Deconstruction (2020):\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/7hVSkiyffPFDL5IDud26kw?si=JDtFjlrYTuafnm6fyuNOhw\n\u00A0\nEar Biscuits Playlist on Spiritual Deconstruction:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLxmqs8vQskUbE_KnXQhA2gXmEg5dVMp3",

In this episode, Sylvia tells us about growing up in a family that read (and debated) the Bible together every day as \u2018a little hippie kid\u2019. She discusses her \u2018radical\u2019 experience as a Christadelphian starting in the 1960\u2019s and \u201870\u2019s in Canada where she helped found a new ecclesia, create a new bible school, and push for women to teach. She also turned heads in her meeting when her parents approved her underage marriage to an unbaptized First Nations \u201Coutsider\u201D. Zinnia and Sylvia also discuss how her ideas were plagiarized for exhortations, the beliefs of First Nations people, and how David is definitely the sexiest Bible character! We also speculate about what we would want to see at an Ex-Christadelphian event.

      "description": "In today\u2019s episode, Zinnia does a deep dive on the history of Christadelphian \u201Cprophecies\u201D and apocalyptic predictions! She starts with the origins of the \u201Cprophetic arithmetic\u201D methods by a rather infamous American in the 1840\u2019s, follows the early prophecies by John Thomas and Robert Roberts, and leads into conversations around prophecies, high control groups, and cognitive dissonance in the modern era. We also chat about aliens, people on Instagram talking about the modern feelings of doom, and some incriminating definitions around their prophetic beliefs that make the Christadelphians look more than just a little bit culty.

In this episode I\u2019m joined by Rob, a Professor of Statistics \u0026 Statistical Forecasting, and Steve, a Professor of Biblical Studies to explore the prophecies they learned (and even taught!) from their time as Christadelphians. Now as ex-Christadelphians, we discuss what they\u2019ve learned about history, statistics, and biblical literature to explore non-Christadelphian perspectives on some common prophecies related to the Bible and Christadelphian culture. We explore prophecies that were supported by a selective view of history, unfulfilled prophecies, and even prophecies that were wrong in the Bible! In this episode we also learn about Rob\u2019s attempt to have his fortune told in India, Steve\u2019s thoughts on satire in the Bible, and learn about the relationship between the Bible and Tarot Cards!

      "description": "Today we\u2019re chatting with Brian about religious trauma! After hearing so many guests discuss traumatizing events that they experienced within the Christadelphian community, we decided to bring in a licensed religious trauma therapist to explore what religious trauma is and what we can do about it. We started with discussing some key definitions and concepts to understand, exploring what modalities Brian uses with clients, and talking about some things to consider when trying to find a therapist to work with, including knowing the difference between searching for a therapist with a specialty in \u201Cspirituality\u201D compared to \u201Creligious trauma\u201D. We also ask some thought provoking questions such as, is pressuring minors to be baptized truly consensual? Why doesn\u2019t the group have an exit plan for members and why is that important to have? And is holding Christadelphian beliefs a cure for mental health struggles? Let\u2019s talk about it! Please enjoy another week of fellowship among the heathens!

In this episode, Kelli shares her experience preparing for what she thought would be the hardest test in her life (the baptismal exam!), learning that playing hymns on guitars would qualify as \u201Cstumbling blocks\u201D for some sisters in Christ, and sharing her experience as a woman who was able to have more of a role when growing up associated with the COGAF group. She also shares some funny stories of sleeping in a pool floaty at a Bible weekend, an unexpected insect encounter during a church service, and shares the joke that ended her involvement in her church newsletter! Zinnia and Kelli also reminisce on long denim skirts, reading Harry Potter as religious children (scandalous!), and on how gross the term \u201Cseed\u201D is! (Bleh!)

      "description": "Today we\u2019re chatting with Vanessa! Vanessa shares her experience of growing up feeling supported as a neurodivergent child in the Christadelphian community with her family. Over time though, she had a feminist awakening and found that her views on women\u0027s roles within the ecclesia didn\u2019t quite fit. Eventually she began studying psychology and realized that she was in a high control religion! After pressure to bring her children in for instruction and hearing explicitly that they wanted to brainwash the children, she decided she wanted better for her family and left the group. Since leaving, Vanessa\u2019s found a sense of purpose that she hadn\u2019t experienced as a Christadelphian and she has finally embraced her authentic self.

Steve shares the important lessons his father taught him about character and standing up for your beliefs (even if that includes refusing to hide the Christmas tree), the punitive response of his former ecclesia when he asked questions about Revelation and ultimately joined another ecclesia, and his ultimate realization that some members of the Christadelphians \u201Cwere prepared to lie in defense of The Truth\u201D.

While they technically have a different name than Christadelphians, the groups were founded by former associates at about the same time. Members of COGAF hold the same beliefs as Christadelphians, fellowship with them, and even attend Christadelphian activities, camps, and bible schools! In today\u2019s episode, we hear about Brian\u2019s former ecclesia using pancakes to convince people to attend services, about that time he was brought to Jamaica for a school project to learn about the life of Christadelphian missionaries as a teenager, and about the \u201Cwave theory\u201D of doubt and faith that eventually washed him ashore to solid ground without faith in God. We also chat about surprise ambushes by Christadelphians who create confrontations about faith and church attendance in the most unexpected times and places.

      "description": "Today we\u2019re flipping the script and Heather is chatting with Zinnia! Zinnia shares her story of growing up as an undiagnosed neurodivergent child and being bullied during her childhood inside and outside of the ecclesia. The first half of this episode is a bit heavy as Zinnia discusses how her environment contributed to severe depression and how growing up in a high control environment among other factors may have groomed her for domestic violence in her relationships. However, things took a turn for the better when Zinnia chose to leave the group, shut down their harassment, reported perpetrators to the police. She also reclaimed her life and her voice by changing her name, moving out on her own, creating a new environment where she could thrive in secular friendships and relationships, and connecting with other ex-Christadelphians in the Facebook community. She also shares her story of living in a haunted apartment, explains why she is skeptical of Christadelphians claiming that they\u2019ll report the criminal activity of other Christadelphians, and about the circumstances that led her to create this podcast. This episode was also released alongside Episode 13 on Spiritualism due to some overlapping themes and topics. We hope you enjoy this podcast double feature! See you in 2025! Also, thank you to Heather for editing this episode!

More specifically, about how the Christadelphians have historically tried to disprove the existence of ghosts and the beliefs of Spiritualists to their followers! It\u2019s time for science class with John Thomas as he explains the (now considered pseudoscience) \u0022science\u0022 of odology, explains how Jesus Christ (electric medium) used hypnosis on his disciples, speculates on whether followers will be able to be invisible and teleport when they\u2019re resurrected (sorry, you can only hold eyeballs), and how God\u2019s Holy Spirit is actually\u2026 electricity. We discover the story of a Christadelphian with psychic abilities and end the episode with the most legendary ghost story to ever be told in Christadelphia! It\u2019s going to get spoooooooky!

Paul also shares his controversial experience giving his one and only public lecture as a Christadelphian, his time as part of a group of Christadelphians nicknamed \u201Cthe four horsemen of the apocalypse\u201D, and about his thesis project on the roots of Christianity which he started after going back to school *again*. There\u2019s no box big enough to fit Paul into as he\u2019s explored careers, countries, and theology throughout his lifetime.

In this episode, we\u2019ll hear about his process of trying to fit into the wider Christadelphian world after growing up in isolation, about his first experience attending an ecclesia that drank Christ\u2019s blood from a shared cup (ew), and on the pressure to leave his new ecclesia and to end his relationship with a non-Christadelphian. We also speculate on his prospects of an American speaking tour, argue for Australia to have its own major winter holiday, and wonder if Christadelphian music will ever be a topic for a pub trivia night at last!?

Mike also shares his experience of unintentionally framing the Editor of the Christadelphian magazine for vandalism (whoops) and answers whether or not he saw any unattached beard hair in the Christadelphian Magazine Archives. And of course, he asks the hard hitting questions such as \u201D...have you got a hat?\u201D. Please join us for yet another fun episode of fellowship among the heathens!

In this episode, we\u2019ll be taking a critical look at whether this famous Christadelphian leader was actually just a follower. I\u2019ll be sharing with you \u201Crespectable heathens\u201D stories about Robert Roberts\u2019 childhood, his quirks, and the chance he missed to leave behind the drama of the Christadelphians forever. I hope you\u2019re as surprised as I was to learn the bizarre ways that he honored John Thomas throughout his lifetime, and even in death. I\u2019ll also share a Christadelphian exhortation drinking game, a request for the whereabouts of a lost object, and a story about a legendary exhortation at the Moorestown ecclesia.

Why did tights have such a chokehold on Christadelphian women for so long? The world may never know but we can laugh about it anyway!

      "description": "Today we\u0027re diving into the origin of the Christadelphians and taking a look at their founder/rediscover-er Doctor John Thomas! Let\u0027s count how many times he got baptized and see what lengths he went to in order to get away from the priest-ridden society of England. This story is probably a little different than the Christadelphian origin story you thought you knew...

However, we would sound a note of caution. During the years since Brother Mansfield penned the above words, many works have been offered to us by an ever-increasing number of writers. Experience has shown us that many of these works are of doubtful value; others, paraded as Christadelphian literature, will prove quite dangerous to the unwary.
