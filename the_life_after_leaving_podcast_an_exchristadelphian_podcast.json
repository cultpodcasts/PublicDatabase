      "description": "Today we\u2019re chatting with Steve about one of his favorite topics, Biblical Studies! In this episode, we learn about the Bible from a former Christadelphian brother who left behind Christadelphian dogma for an open-minded scholarly approach to the Bible. In this episode, Dr. Steve reframes and explores many topics that we thought we knew about to see how context, translation, and history play a part in truly understanding the Bible. We learn that the Dead Sea Scrolls do *not* prove that the Bible hasn\u2019t changed (like some of us were told), that the Bible underwent editing, redaction, and other changes throughout history (rather than being the perfect, unchangeable word of God), and that numerous passages in the Bible actually quote texts that are not found in the KJV Bible we read at all (and we never noticed?!) Steve\u2019s expertise also brings about interesting discussion about the evolution of the doctrine of resurrection, the idea of atonement, whether God forbids homosexuality in Leviticus, and whether \u201CPaul\u201D actually wrote that women should be silent in the ecclesia. We also had fun exploring \u201Csex, drugs, and rock n\u2019 roll\u201D in the Bible, reading \u201CSolomon\u2019s top ten pick-up lines\u201D, and listening to Steve\u2019s memory of a satirical prayer given at a Christadelphian ecclesia. Be warned, you\u2019ll need to leave your Strongs Concordance at home for this episode, otherwise you\u2019ll fail this class! Listener discretion advised.

      "description": "In today\u2019s episode, Zinnia and Pete discuss six more historical examples of criminality among the Christadelphians that were not covered in our first true crime episode- from investigations into meat pies and hate speech, to missing charitable funds, and even murder! Let\u2019s get into the spirit of spooky season as we discuss childhood medical neglect and speculate on why religious communities are so skeptical of modern medicine and vaccines, the passivity of believers who follow a \u201CJesus take the wheel\u201D approach to their life, and about how the \u201Cpunishment\u201D for embezzlement looks a lot like a reward, or even condoning theft of charitable funds! We also look at how criminal investigations were handled during the early days of Christadelphia under Robert Roberts compared to the present day (hint: there were no secret meetings or letters). And we also have a few laughs as we learn about the Christadelphian view on sex toys, contrast modern medicine with biblical medicine, and discover (while recording!) that the thisisyourbible.com website was apparently hacked years ago and no one noticed!\u00A0\n\n\u00A0\n\nAlso, please don\u2019t send me your opinions on vaccines.

In this episode, we hear from a former brother about the difficulties of growing up in a family perpetually changing ecclesias, of struggling to build friendships within the Christadelphian community, and of trying to meet the complicated standards for public prayers and bible readings. Peter shares how he had felt so mentally immobilized by fear that he had never questioned any of the doctrines until he met a Christadelphian who did, setting Peter on a path of asking questions, fact checking Christadelphian teachings, and eventually realizing that some Christadelphians share incorrect information (sometimes knowingly!) Peter also speaks up against the harmful views he was taught about \u201Cmarital rights\u201D, the intense schedule of attendance that was expected of Christadelphians every week in England, and of his struggles to create his own identity, beliefs, and community as an ex-Christadelphian adult.\u00A0\n\nListener discretion advised.\n\n\u00A0\n\nResources and References:\n\n\u00A0\n\nWiki mentioning Central Name Change based on location\u00A0\n\n\u201CBirmingham Temperance Hall ecclesia (so known after the location of their rented rooms)...

      "description": "Today we\u2019re chatting with (another) Vanessa! In this episode, we interview our first ex-Christadelphian raised in the \u201COld Paths\u201D sub-group of the Christadelphian sect. Vanessa shares some stories from their community such as their caravan tent version of Bible School, the strict rules baptized members were required to agree to such as never going to the movies, and about how her family refused to fellowship with \u201CCentral\u201D Christadelphians while visiting. However, Vanessa was always excited to learn and even startled her Sunday School teacher with the surprising facts she shared from reading Malcolm X. Despite her then-husband\u2019s disapproval as a young woman, she continued to read and study outside of traditional domestic fields, eventually getting her PhD (and divorcing her Christadelphian husband). We also chat about wine so watered down that even thieves returned it, people pleasing and abusive relationships after being raised in high control religion, and the therapeutic creative project she undertook after leaving. Also, this episode is dedicated to our new podcast patron saint Keanu Reeves.\u00A0\n\nPlease join us for another episode of fellowship among the Heathens!\n\nListener discretion advised.\u00A0\n\n\u00A0\n\nResources and References:\n\n\u00A0\n\nSpeed (1994 Film):\n\nhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111257/\n\n\u00A0\n\nKeanu Reeves:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keanu_Reeves\n\n\u00A0\n\nGoodreads- Cult Memoirs:\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/cult-memoirs\n\n\u00A0\n\nVanessa\u2019s first book \u2018Holy Bible:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Holy-Bible-Vanessa-Russell-ebook/dp/B085DLDJWF/ref=sr_1_1?crid=12PM33O8KXBTM\u0026dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.P2UQqnx3tzVC00lQZU8J1A.UwnyG3mR0ZIKtTEP206TUR3FytgSL6LAFRXG5D6N6jg\u0026dib_tag=se\u0026keywords=vanessa\u002Brussell\u002Bholy\u002Bbible\u0026qid=1746401165\u0026s=books\u0026sprefix=vanessa\u002Brussell\u002Bholy\u002Bbible%2Cstripbooks%2C87\u0026sr=1-1\n\n\u00A0\n\nVanessa\u0027s second book \u2018The World is Not Big Enough\u2019\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/World-Is-Not-Big-Enough/dp/1743796838\n\n\u00A0\n\nNetflix: American Murder: Gabby Petito (2025)\n\nhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt35590630/\n\n\u00A0\n\nNetflix: American Murder: Laci Peterson (2024)\nhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt33079160/\n\n\u00A0\n\nGary Schaefer (1951-2023), Christadelphian Serial Killer:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Schaefer\n\n\u00A0\n\nEMDR Therapy (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing):\u00A0\n\nhttps://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/treatments/eye-movement-reprocessing",

In this episode, Mako shares his experience traveling the world as a (white, male) Christadelphian before spending the years following his baptism serving in Jamaica as a missionary. After marrying his (Jamaican) wife and settling in America, his eyes were opened to racism \u0026 sexism among the Christadelphians when it became directed towards his family and as Christadelphians grappled with the Black Lives Matter movement. Mako also shares the story of how his small ecclesia split, how white Christadelphians online refused to even acknowledge racism in the Christadelphian community, and how he struggled to get distance from the Christadelphian community when they held the memorial service in his house every week! We also learn about his epic baptism, that time a Sunday School teacher crushed his dreams, and about his enduring love for the beach and ocean. Towards the end of the episode we also get philosophical as we speculate about ghosts, the Kingdom of God, and on the impact on society if everyone simply decided to \u201Clet God fix it\u201D.\nPlease join us for another episode of fellowship among the heathens!\n\u00A0\nListener discretion advised.\n\u00A0\nWhite Savior Complex:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_savior\nhttps://www.health.com/mind-body/health-diversity-inclusion/white-savior-complex\n\u00A0\nMicroaggressions:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression\nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/06/08/872371063/microaggressions-are-a-big-deal-how-to-talk-them-out-and-when-to-walk-away\n\u00A0\nBlack Lives Matter Movement:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter\nhttps://library.law.howard.edu/civilrightshistory/BLM\nhttps://blacklivesmatter.com/\n\u00A0\nPascal\u2019s wager\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager#The_wager\n\u00A0\nBarbie Movie (2023)\nhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt1517268/\n\u00A0\nMako\u2019s exhortation on Love:\u00A0\nAvailable on our Facebook Page (too long for the show notes!)",

We also discuss mental health issues she experienced while she was a Christadelphian, how the Arranging Brothers refused to accept her resignation, and her method of using note taking to lure in a godly man. Chloe also shares her childhood ghost stories, discusses the anxious thoughts she had about the \u201CKingdom of God\u201D, and opens up about the peer pressure around her baptism. We also ask, why would we ever want to be like the angels? Why is it so hard to develop close relationships as a Christadelphian?

She also turned heads in her meeting when her parents approved her underage marriage to an unbaptized First Nations \u201Coutsider\u201D. Zinnia and Sylvia also discuss how her ideas were plagiarized for exhortations, the beliefs of First Nations people, and how David is definitely the sexiest Bible character!

She starts with the origins of the \u201Cprophetic arithmetic\u201D methods by a rather infamous American in the 1840\u2019s, follows the early prophecies by John Thomas and Robert Roberts, and leads into conversations around prophecies, high control groups, and cognitive dissonance in the modern era. We also chat about aliens, people on Instagram talking about the modern feelings of doom, and some incriminating definitions around their prophetic beliefs that make the Christadelphians look more than just a little bit culty.

In this episode I\u2019m joined by Rob, a Professor of Statistics \u0026 Statistical Forecasting, and Steve, a Professor of Biblical Studies to explore the prophecies they learned (and even taught!) from their time as Christadelphians. Now as ex-Christadelphians, we discuss what they\u2019ve learned about history, statistics, and biblical literature to explore non-Christadelphian perspectives on some common prophecies related to the Bible and Christadelphian culture. We explore prophecies that were supported by a selective view of history, unfulfilled prophecies, and even prophecies that were wrong in the Bible! In this episode we also learn about Rob\u2019s attempt to have his fortune told in India, Steve\u2019s thoughts on satire in the Bible, and learn about the relationship between the Bible and Tarot Cards!

      "description": "Today we\u2019re chatting with Brian about religious trauma! After hearing so many guests discuss traumatizing events that they experienced within the Christadelphian community, we decided to bring in a licensed religious trauma therapist to explore what religious trauma is and what we can do about it. We started with discussing some key definitions and concepts to understand, exploring what modalities Brian uses with clients, and talking about some things to consider when trying to find a therapist to work with, including knowing the difference between searching for a therapist with a specialty in \u201Cspirituality\u201D compared to \u201Creligious trauma\u201D. We also ask some thought provoking questions such as, is pressuring minors to be baptized truly consensual? Why doesn\u2019t the group have an exit plan for members and why is that important to have? And is holding Christadelphian beliefs a cure for mental health struggles? Let\u2019s talk about it! Please enjoy another week of fellowship among the heathens!

She also shares some funny stories of sleeping in a pool floaty at a Bible weekend, an unexpected insect encounter during a church service, and shares the joke that ended her involvement in her church newsletter! Zinnia and Kelli also reminisce on long denim skirts, reading Harry Potter as religious children (scandalous!), and on how gross the term \u201Cseed\u201D is! (Bleh!)

Over time though, she had a feminist awakening and found that her views on women\u0027s roles within the ecclesia didn\u2019t quite fit. Eventually she began studying psychology and realized that she was in a high control religion! After pressure to bring her children in for instruction and hearing explicitly that they wanted to brainwash the children, she decided she wanted better for her family and left the group. Since leaving, Vanessa\u2019s found a sense of purpose that she hadn\u2019t experienced as a Christadelphian and she has finally embraced her authentic self.

While they technically have a different name than Christadelphians, the groups were founded by former associates at about the same time. Members of COGAF hold the same beliefs as Christadelphians, fellowship with them, and even attend Christadelphian activities, camps, and bible schools! In today\u2019s episode, we hear about Brian\u2019s former ecclesia using pancakes to convince people to attend services, about that time he was brought to Jamaica for a school project to learn about the life of Christadelphian missionaries as a teenager, and about the \u201Cwave theory\u201D of doubt and faith that eventually washed him ashore to solid ground without faith in God. We also chat about surprise ambushes by Christadelphians who create confrontations about faith and church attendance in the most unexpected times and places.

      "description": "Today we\u2019re flipping the script and Heather is chatting with Zinnia! Zinnia shares her story of growing up as an undiagnosed neurodivergent child and being bullied during her childhood inside and outside of the ecclesia. The first half of this episode is a bit heavy as Zinnia discusses how her environment contributed to severe depression and how growing up in a high control environment among other factors may have groomed her for domestic violence in her relationships. However, things took a turn for the better when Zinnia chose to leave the group, shut down their harassment, reported perpetrators to the police. She also reclaimed her life and her voice by changing her name, moving out on her own, creating a new environment where she could thrive in secular friendships and relationships, and connecting with other ex-Christadelphians in the Facebook community. She also shares her story of living in a haunted apartment, explains why she is skeptical of Christadelphians claiming that they\u2019ll report the criminal activity of other Christadelphians, and about the circumstances that led her to create this podcast.

      "description": "Today we\u2019re chatting about ghosts! More specifically, about how the Christadelphians have historically tried to disprove the existence of ghosts and the beliefs of Spiritualists to their followers! It\u2019s time for science class with John Thomas as he explains the (now considered pseudoscience) \u0022science\u0022 of odology, explains how Jesus Christ (electric medium) used hypnosis on his disciples, speculates on whether followers will be able to be invisible and teleport when they\u2019re resurrected (sorry, you can only hold eyeballs), and how God\u2019s Holy Spirit is actually\u2026 electricity. We discover the story of a Christadelphian with psychic abilities and end the episode with the most legendary ghost story to ever be told in Christadelphia! It\u2019s going to get spoooooooky!

In this episode, Paul shares his story of joining the Christadelphians with his parents as a young convert, to stirring up trouble in the capital city as a young man handing out pamphlets on the Holy Spirit, to eventually not only leaving the Christadelphians, but eventually becoming an atheist studying theology! Paul also shares his controversial experience giving his one and only public lecture as a Christadelphian, his time as part of a group of Christadelphians nicknamed \u201Cthe four horsemen of the apocalypse\u201D, and about his thesis project on the roots of Christianity which he started after going back to school *again*. There\u2019s no box big enough to fit Paul into as he\u2019s explored careers, countries, and theology throughout his lifetime. I hope you enjoy this episode and hearing about the twists and turns of his fascinating life!

Luke shares his experience growing up in a small, insular ecclesia disconnected from the wider community of Christadelphians and singing the same hymns every week. In this episode, we\u2019ll hear about his process of trying to fit into the wider Christadelphian world after growing up in isolation, about his first experience attending an ecclesia that drank Christ\u2019s blood from a shared cup (ew), and on the pressure to leave his new ecclesia and to end his relationship with a non-Christadelphian. We also speculate on his prospects of an American speaking tour, argue for Australia to have its own major winter holiday, and wonder if Christadelphian music will ever be a topic for a pub trivia night at last!? And remember\u2026 watch out because the \u201CChristadelphian Police\u201D can be anywhere! Please join us for yet another fun episode of fellowship among the heathens!

Mako and Zinnia discuss the experiences shared by some ex-Christadelphians about beards and compare it to the historical views of Christadelphians during the time of Doctor John Thomas and Robert Roberts. We also joke about drag names, the British slang for penis, and moustaches on firemen! Please join us for a chat about this hairy topic!

In this episode, we\u2019ll be taking a critical look at whether this famous Christadelphian leader was actually just a follower. I\u2019ll be sharing with you \u201Crespectable heathens\u201D stories about Robert Roberts\u2019 childhood, his quirks, and the chance he missed to leave behind the drama of the Christadelphians forever. I hope you\u2019re as surprised as I was to learn the bizarre ways that he honored John Thomas throughout his lifetime, and even in death.
