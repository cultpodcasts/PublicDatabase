      "description": "A lot of people find their meaning and vocation through a place like the Vatican but that being said there are some things that the Popes and Vatican City has done that are little less than morally good to say the least. So in today\u2019s video I want to explore some of the darker side of the Catholic Church and cover some of the darker sides of their history. There is surprisingly a lot of darkness buried in their long history, a lot more than I was expecting but I\u2019m going to focus on two areas I personally find the most abhorrent. The church\u0027s agreement with the Nazi \u0026 Facist goverment - Hitler and Mussolini and their approach towards the Holocaust. As well as child abuses and the concurring cover ups of said crimes over the years.\n\nThe catholic church has done both good and bad in this world.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nPlease like, share \u0026 subscribe.\n\n#catholicchurch #vthevatican #popefrancis",

      "description": "Possibly one of the biggest cult stories in America, Heavens gate convinced its members using a mix of Christian millenarianism new age and ufology with classic brainwashing and manipulation leading to the mass suicide of it\u2019s members in 1997. \n\nMarshall H Applewhite, the founder believed Jesus was an extraterrestrial who came to Earth to teach humanity how to transcend their physical bodies. He saw himself as the reincarnation of Jesus, returning to complete the work of spiritual evolution and help believers ascend to the Next Level.\n\nThroughout the 70\u0027s he recruited 100\u0027s of people with help from his friend Bonnie. He and Bonnie concluded they were the two endgame witnesses mentioned in Revelation 11. \n\nUnlike other cults there isn\u2019t much documented physical or sexual abuse among its members but of course there was mental manipulation and control that can be classified as emotional and mental abuse which prevented members to use critical thinking and be easily controlled. \n\nIn March 1997, police entered a mansion in Rancho Sante Fe in San Diego California, discovering the 39 victims of mass suicide, 21 women and 18 men. They were all found lying peaceably in matching dark clothes and Nike sneakers and had no noticeable signs of blood or trauma.\n\nIt\u2019s a stark reminder to all of us weaponised religion with charismatic leaders and the power of belief can easily influence others.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nPlease like, share and subscribe.\n\n#heavensgate #cult #religion",

      "description": "In 1968 preacher David Brandt Berg founded a group called Teens for Christ which at first consisted of young runaways and hippies who were so called born again hippies. Over time the church would become the children of god  (now known as the Family International at its peak had 150,000 members around the world.) At the height of its popularity it had members such as River and Joaquin Phoenix, Rose McGowan and Jeremy Spencer who was a founding member of Fleetwood Mac that left the band in 1971 to join the cult. \n\nBerg promotes love and sex with children as young as 5 years of age and committed multiple abuses against his members especially the children.\n\nIn 1976 as an attempt to entice more members, he would use sex to show Gods love and mercy. As a result over 223,989 people were fished and over 10,000 babies were born through cult woman from 1971 to 2001 according to records from the cult and also hilariously enough caused a spread of herpes throughout the cult.  \n\nWoman of the cult were forced to do this whether they wanted to or not.  It was so engrained in their doctrine to do so to spread gods love.\n\nIt was a vile a disgusting cult.\n\nThanks for watching.\n\nPlease like, share and subscribe.\n\n#cult #childrenofgod #religion",

It allowed these pastors into the home of their faithful followers allowing them to reach audiences at unprecedented numbers. \n\nThere are many examples of corrupt pastors who used this medium to extract as much money as possible from their followers.

I would find it hard to believe that their are many people who have not heard of a religion that has one of the biggest celebrities in the world connected to it - Tom Cruise.\n\nScientology is infamous for harassing ex members and pretty much anyone who openly critiques them.  They use psychological warfare to control their members, gaslighting them and manipulating every aspect of their lives. They have vast tax free wealth, in which they use to buy property all over the world.

      "description": "QAnon is a far-right conspiracy theory that originated on internet message boards in October 2017. It centres around an anonymous individual known as \u0022Q\u0022 who claims to have insider knowledge of a secret global conspiracy involving high-ranking officials and politicians, which they refer to as the \u0022deep state\u0022 or \u0022cabal\u0022. QAnon followers believe that this conspiracy is working to undermine and overthrow the U.S. government, and that Donald Trump is secretly working to expose and defeat it.\n\nThe conspiracy theory is based on a series of cryptic messages posted by \u0022Q\u0022 on internet message boards, which followers interpret as clues to unraveling the supposed conspiracy. QAnon has been linked to several real-world incidents, including the storming of the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, and has been classified by the FBI as a domestic terrorist threat.\nIt\u0027s important to note that QAnon is not based on any credible evidence or facts, and has been widely debunked by experts and fact-checkers. It promotes dangerous and false information, and can lead to real-world harm.\n\nThanks for watching.\n\nPlease like, share and subscribe!\n#conspiracy #trump #documentary #critique",
