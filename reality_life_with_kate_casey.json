      "description": "Kate discusses the Netflix documentary Evil Influencer: The Jodi Hildebrandt Story, a chilling true-crime examination of Utah therapist Jodi Hildebrandt and her role in a devastating child abuse case involving popular parenting YouTuber Ruby Franke. Directed by Skye Borgman, the film explores how Hildebrandt, a licensed therapist and life coach, built power and credibility through her program ConneXions, ultimately manipulating Franke and others by weaponizing therapeutic language and moral authority. \nThe documentary escalates as it reveals the \u201Cinhumane and merciless disciplinary regime\u201D enforced under Hildebrandt\u2019s influence, normalizing cruelty in the name of accountability and faith. The story reaches its horrifying conclusion in August 2023, when Franke\u2019s emaciated 12-year-old son escaped through a window of Hildebrandt\u2019s home and sought help from a neighbor, triggering the arrest of both women and exposing the dangers of unchecked influence, therapy culture misuse, and social media-driven credibility. \n\n\nReality Life with Kate Casey \nWhat to Watch List: https://katecasey.substack.com (https://katecasey.substack.com/) \nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/katecasey (http://www.patreon.com/katecasey) \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/katecasey (https://twitter.com/katecasey) \nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/katecaseyca (http://www.instagram.com/katecaseyca) \nTik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@itskatecasey?lang=en (https://www.tiktok.com/@itskatecasey?lang=en) \nFacebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/113157919338245 (https://www.facebook.com/groups/113157919338245) \nAmazon List: https://www.amazon.com/shop/katecasey (https://www.amazon.com/shop/katecasey) \nLike it to Know It: https://www.shopltk.com/explore/katecasey (https://www.shopltk.com/explore/katecasey)\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy (https://art19.com/privacy) and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info (https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info).\n\nEpisode link: https://play.headliner.app/episode/30915539?utm_source=youtube",

In 1998, she and Keith Raniere co-founded ESP, which Raniere later expanded into the broader umbrella organization NXIVM. He presented NXIVM as an elite self-improvement and leadership training company, but it ultimately became a vehicle for manipulation, coercive control, and the secretive subgroup DOS that led to his federal conviction. Nancy was sentenced in 2021 to 42 months in federal prison for racketeering-related charges connected to her role in the organization. \n\nIn this first part, she discusses how she met Raniere, the creation and rapid growth of ESP, and what was really happening behind the scenes as the organization evolved. \n\n\nReality Life with Kate Casey \nWhat to Watch List: https://katecasey.substack.com (https://katecasey.substack.com/) \nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/katecasey (http://www.patreon.com/katecasey) \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/katecasey (https://twitter.com/katecasey) \nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/katecaseyca (http://www.instagram.com/katecaseyca) \nTik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@itskatecasey?lang=en (https://www.tiktok.com/@itskatecasey?lang=en) \nFacebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/113157919338245 (https://www.facebook.com/groups/113157919338245) \nAmazon List: https://www.amazon.com/shop/katecasey (https://www.amazon.com/shop/katecasey) \nLike it to Know It: https://www.shopltk.com/explore/katecasey (https://www.shopltk.com/explore/katecasey)\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy (https://art19.com/privacy) and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info (https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info).\n\nEpisode link: https://play.headliner.app/episode/30153021?utm_source=youtube",

The series explores the extraordinary and unsettling journey of Allison Mack, the former Smallville actress who became a high-ranking member of NXIVM, the organization exposed as a dangerous cult, and later a convicted felon. For this new season, Nathalie gains exclusive access to Allison following her release from prison, tracing her path from television stardom to NXIVM\u2019s inner circle \u2014 and examining her attempts to rebuild her life in the aftermath. Through revealing conversations with those who knew Allison before, during, and after NXIVM, Nathalie dives deep into the gray zones of influence, accountability, and redemption. Kate and Nathalie discuss how this story reframes public perception of Allison Mack, what drew so many to NXIVM\u2019s promises of empowerment, and what Uncovered reveals about manipulation, forgiveness, and the complexities of starting over.
