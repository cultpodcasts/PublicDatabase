And their apocalyptic teachings would influence Charles Manson\u0027s vision of Helter Skelter.

He and a few of his wives would run their scam for decades. They convinced members to live on their compound, pay to be in continual therapy, and pay to put on propaganda plays at their Fourth Wall Theater. Members also paid to be sexually used by cult leadership, leadership that decided who they had sex with, who they could have kids with, who would raise those kids, and so much more. Cult! Cult!

Or is it an organization, with its focus on modern day prophecy, \u00A0where cult leaders can easily recruit followers? \u00A0In 2012, IHOPKC member Bethany Deaton was found dead, and investigators looking into her suicide (originally thought to be a murder case), uncovered a small offshoot cult within IHOPKC lead by Tyler Deaton, a charismatic young man and IHOPKC adherent who felt, like Mike Bickle, that he was also a modern prophet. He also felt that God had, like with Bickle, tasked him with helping raise an army of spiritual warriors to do battle with Satan\u0027s minions in an imminent, apocalyptic showdown between good and evil.

We\u0027ll examine the history of the church\u0027s views on sexuality. Why did they choose celibacy for priests? Does it have any scriptural basis? How does not allowing priests to have a sexual life (or at least forcing them to do so in secrecy) affect their psychological development/health? Mostly, we look into how long sex scandals within the church have been happening, how pervasive they are, and if they\u0027re going away anytime soon.\u00A0Bad Magic Productions Monthly Patreon Donation: \u00A0In honor of the passing of Jeff Burton from the Rizzuto Show aka the Rizz Show on 105.7 FM in St Louis, we are donating (amount tbd) to Jeff\u0027s charity of choice - Kids Rock Cancer.

      "description": "Sometimes the truth is stranger than fiction. Such a good example of that with this week\u0027s episode. In 2018, I watched a fascinating docuseries on Netflix called Wild, Wild Country about a controversial guru building a utopian city in the Oregon desert. I thought about doing an episode about the Rajneeshees then, but I didn\u0027t want to be overly influenced by that one show. I\u0027m glad I waited. More dirt on the cult has come to light in the years since, and we look into it today. Did Bhagwan Rajneesh really offer enlightenment to his followers? Did he really ever even care about enlightenment? Or was it all about getting rich and sex? Or was it about enlightenment AND getting rich AND sex? Bhagwan\u0027s messages often seem empowering and enlightened at quick glance, but looking deeper, there was always a lot of darkness inside the supposed utopia he was trying to build.

He thought he could read messages from god by studying his spit. Despite all this, \u00A0instead of getting proper treatment, he was encouraged to not take his antipsychotic medication. He was told his ills could be prayed away. He was told he was cured by a quack chiropractor who thought he could ease Ed\u0027s troubled \u00A0mind by pulling on his toes and making him drink blackstrap molasses. Seriously.

      "description": "Did you know that Jesus was half-alien? And so was Buddha? And Muhammed, Joseph Smith, Moses, Abraham, and many other proclaimed \u00A0prophets throughout history. There are 40 in total, and a failed French pop musician and wannabe race car driver, Claude Vorilhon, claims to be the final and most important one. He\u0027s \u0022Ra\u00EBl,\u0022 which he says means \u0022messenger of the Elohim.\u0022 And who are the Elohim, in Claude\u0027s mind? A race of highly evolved aliens who created humanity 25,000 years ago. And they\u0027re coming back soon to either obliterate us, or raise our consciousness substantially and teach us how to use incredibly advanced technology, such as a machine that can clone anyone in a super cool sci-fi way that allows you to live forever. \u00A0Claude and his Ra\u00EBlians have a lot of interesting beliefs! And they\u0027re very, VERY into sexual freedom. Ra\u00EBlianism seems to be more about sex than it is about aliens. And it is also part of a very interesting modern branch of theology known as UFO religion.

      "description": "A lot to unpack today! Who are the Amish? Why do they dress and live like it\u0027s still the 17th century? How are they related to Mennonites? What interpretation of Christianity led to them to the lifestyle they live today? Are they happy? Are they a cult? Today we\u0027ll explore the Anabaptist, Protestant Reformation \u00A0origins of the Amish and how they differ from Mennonites. We\u0027ll look at their practices of Rumspringa and shunning. We\u0027ll examine why the refuse to drive cars or use computers. We\u0027ll also dig into some examples of their communities not handling sexual abuse in an even remotely appropriate way. Are they really just a harmless, simple, live-off-the-land group of Christians? Or is there something sinister about many of their core beliefs?

Maybe you\u0027ve noticed their \u0022Kingdom Halls.\u0022 Maybe they\u0027ve knocked on your door. But - do you really know anything about them? Before this week, I didn\u0027t. Now that I do, I will NEVER look at them the same way again. The Jehovah\u0027s may not live on a compound, but, in my opinion they are a dangerous doomsday cult. Their continual focus on impending Armageddon has hurt so, so many lives. And so has their \u0022Two Witness Rule.\u0022 The Governing Body of the Witnesses pressure congregations to not go to the police with criminal accusations, including rape and sexual abuse. Instead, Witnesses are told to take accusations to congregational elders who record the accusations confidentially. And elders are told that if two or more people didn\u0027t witness the crime occur, then it essentially didn\u0027t happen. These policies have led to the creation of what\u0027s believed to be the largest database of pedophiles ever - pedophiles the organization has provided a safe haven. Known predators have even been paired with future victims to go preach the \u0022truth\u0022 door-to-door. The truth is, the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses are an incredible unlikable organization. I lay out their history, their beliefs, and their most shameful policies on another Cult! Cult! Cult! edition of Timesuck.

      "description": "A very recent Christian militant cult, the Aggressive Christianity Mission Training Corps was founded in the late 1970s by married couple Lila and Jim Green. Lila would later change her name to Deborah, after the biblical prophetess of the God of the Israelites and the only female judge mentioned in the Bible. And she ruled her cult with an iron fist. And then, after decades of keeping her cult members continually worried about the devil and engaging in strange rituals like giving birth to spirit babies to become soldiers in god\u0027s army, Jim, Deb, and their son-in-law Peter Green were finally arrested on various charges of abuse, including sexual abuse of children. Today we explore the rise and fall of this sad, hateful little organization, and examine the popular fundamentalist, evangelical christianity it was born out of, on another cult! cult! cult! edition of Timesuck. We\u0027re donating $15,000 this month to The Wildland Firefighter Foundation. Since 1999, the Foundation has also provided emergency support services to the families of firefighters, seriously injured or killed in the line of duty.

And only a good disco/r\u0026b vocalist if you compare him to other cult leaders who also have dabbled in music. But somehow this two-bit con man strung together around two hundred pamphlets full of his very confusing and constantly changing theology, or \u0022factology\u0022 as he\u0027d call it. The only message that remained the same as Dwight shifted his teachings from being based in Islam to Christianity to American Indian mythology to extraterrestrial, conspiratorial, Heaven\u0027s Gate-ish teachings, to Egyptian lore - was a consistent focus on black supremacy. And the only action of Dwight\u0027s that remained constant over the course of two plus decades of running his cult, was the sexual abuse of his followers. Dwight York, now incarcerated in Colorado\u0027s ADX Florence \u0022supermax\u0022 prison, was a sexual predator who preyed on victims as young as four. He somehow convinced a few hundred followers to build a massive Egyptian-themed cult compound for him in Georgia, the third compound he\u0027d build after the first in Brooklyn and the second in upstate New York. Today\u0027s tale is a wild one. Cult! Cult! Cult!

      "description": "Cult! Cult! Cult! We\u0027re back to sucking on a cult - a small and relatively unknown one which is surprising considering how crazy this story is. For well over a decade, conman Daniel Perez convinced a small band of followers into thinking he was possessed by three mostly evil angels, or maybe was an angel, and that he had the keys to heaven, or maybe reincarnation? And that he could make it rain, or maybe bring animals back from the dead? He was way better at talking followers into dying so he could get their life insurance money than he was at keeping his nonsensical claims straight. For years, he and his small band of followers lived on a compound called Angel\u0027s Landing just outside of Wichita, Kansas, messing around with ATVs, driving fast cars, playing with model airplanes, and getting drunk at weekend parties while everyone conveniently ignored the fact that he was doing stuff like sharing his bed with an eleven-year-old. This ridiculous pervert has been in prison for years now where he will thankfully die. Find out how he got there on this week\u0027s super strange tale.

      "description": "Founded in 1974 by a man named Joe Ricci, the Elan School was supposed to be someplace where you could send your troubled teen so they could be rehabilitated and put back on the right track. But in reality, it was a cruel and chaotic nightmare where students were constantly being pressured to confess to things they\u2019d done \u201Cwrong,\u201D called \u201Cguilts,\u201D which often were things as silly and not-wrong as having a crush on someone or smiling too much. At Elan, student was pitted against student in insane psychological mind-games and also pitted against each other physically. And most all of this was perfectly legal. It was considered healthy rehab! And the Elan School wouldn\u2019t close until 2011. Today we use the Elan School as an excuse to explore the rise of the troubled teen industry in the US and how it all sprung out of a cult called Synanon. We also explore how the notion of childhood and parenting has been constantly changing for centuries in an attempt to rationalize why anyone would send their kid to the living Hell of a place like Synanon.

      "description": "Cult! Cult! Cult! The NXIVM Sex Cult! Founded by Keith Raniere in 1998 - at its height, NXIVM counted thousands of members, including celebrities, heirs and heiresses who all paid thousands, and sometimes MILLIONS of dollars to attend a never-ending series of classes at various NVIXM training centers. Lying at the intersection of a multi-level marketing scheme, a self-help group, and occasionally a summer camp, NXIVM was FOR SURE a cult. People started publicly worrying about how dangerous this cult might be all the way back in 2003. But it wouldn\u2019t be until 2017, when the New York Times published an article about how some of its members were being literally BRANDED like cattle as a part of an initiation into a secret sex cult within NXIVM, that the group\u2019s true and terrible practices would be brought into the light and exposed. Today, we\u2019ll meet some people - seemingly ordinary people - that so desperately wanted someone to lead them to enlightenment that they allowed themselves to be slowly manipulated into paying to participate in weirder and weirder \u201Cexercises\u201D until they finally agreed to be sex slaves. How did Keith pull this off? How did he manage to keep NXIVM going for almost twenty years? How do NXIVM and other multi-level marketing schemes keep manipulating people into taking their money? What psychological processes lead to people getting into and then staying in an MLM, or cult, or both? Find out today on a very different kind of episode.  We donated $7200 to Girls in the Know.

      "description": "The Immanuel David Cult! Not much has been written about Immanuel David compared to more notable cult leaders like Jim Jones or David Koresh - but he was just as delusional and, in his own way, just as destructive. Immanuel David was born in the late 1930s to seemingly normal parents - he had what was likely a great childhood - and then, not long after converting to Mormonism, he decided that he was the REAL prophet that should lead his new religion. After the LDS church excommunicated him, Immanuel David created his own church\u2026 and went off to live on a communal compound where a group of people, including his wife Rachel and their seven children, would worship him -  not as God\u0027s prophet anymore -  but as God in the flesh.  In true cult leader fashion, he gave his followers biblical names and tricked them into giving him money while they all waited for the US government and the LDS faith to collapse, and for Immanuel to rise up out of the ashes and lead a new church. And then David\u0027s rein as cult leader came to end in 1978 in a very dramatic and horrifying way.  This week we\u2019ll also examine into some of the fringier aspects of Mormonism\u2019s theological history, as some of these elements lead to the construction of David\u0027s cult. And we\u0027ll give a brief overview of a few other FLDS cults, on today\u0027s messianic edition of Timesuck.ProCon Election Comparison: https://2020election.procon.org/view.source-summary-chart.phpDonated $7000 to the SBP.

      "description": "Susan Alamo was a cult leader and televangelist who founded the Alamo Christian Foundation with her husband, Tony, in Hollywood, in the late 1960s. Then they quickly built a compound just north of LA for their growing number of followers. And then they built a HUGE compound in Arkansas a few years later. Susan thought that God spoke to her, and when she died, Tony claimed that Susan spoke to him on behalf of God. And if God did talk to these two, he sure told them to do a lot of horrible stuff. The Alamo Christian Foundation was at the heart of a number of lawsuits and government actions, and Tony was jailed numerous times on a variety of charges, including income tax evasion, the theft of his late wife\u2019s body, and taking underage girls across state lines for sex. Tony started off as a con artist and ended up as a polygamist and pedophile who abused his followers for decades. The Alamos made a lot of money off of these abused followers. Tens of millions of dollars. And Tony also bedazzled a lot of jean jackets. You read that right.

The promising beginning, insane planning, and tragic pre-life-in-prison final acts of Taylor Helzer are hard to wrap one\u0027s mind around. Taylor grew up as a devout Mormon, a no-drug, no-sex, no-profanity, law-abiding-citizen until shortly after returning home from his two-year Mormon mission at the age of 21. Then he got married, quickly grew dissatisfied with married life, then started coming up with a preposterously delusional plan to take over the Mormon church using Brazilian orphan-assassins and money he\u0027d made with a weird escort business.

Its leader, Hulon Mitchell, jr., aka Yahweh ben Yahweh, estimated the sect\u0027s holdings at $100 million. And what did this cult believe? That white people are \u0022devils\u0022 and that black Americans and Africans are the true Jews who should own Israel and that white Jews are the spawn of Satan. And what did this cult do? They killed a bunch of people and their leader molested and manipulated an untold number of followers in the craziest of ways. One of the wildest tales we\u0027ve told so far!

The cult was also based in a lifestyle of sex, drugs, and rock n\u0027roll. And also vegetarianism. Bust mostly sex and rock n\u0027roll. Roughly 150 counter-culture flower children lived together, first in LA, and then in Hawaii, giving themself super cult-y, crystally names like Moonbeam the Aquarian. And then Father Yod lost his faith and the whole cult went down in a tragic hang-gliding accident. It\u0027s a strange story and I enjoyed telling it today, on Timesuck!

The baby has had a wooden dagger run through its heart in an obvious ritual killing. Forty-eight other cult members would take their lives that evening. And then another sixteen in 1995. And then five more in 1997. Why? Why did so many cult members take their own lives? What did these people believe in? Madness. They believed in so much madness. And I\u0027ll break that madness down and tell the story of the formation and destruction of this strange cult today on Timesuck.

      "description": "The Children of God cult aka The Family aka The Family International is still around today which is very disturbing considering their twisted origins and disgusting, sexually exploitive doctrinal past. Founded by David \u0022Huge Perv\u0022 Berg in 1968 in Huntington Beach, California, they now operate to an unknown degree internationally, basing their existence in a highly sexualized interpretation of Biblical teachings, interpreting God\u0027s love as being expressed best through sex. Berg initially took a second wife saying it was God\u0027s will, as cult leaders so often do. He then began showing his followers \u0022God\u0027s love\u0022 first through secret orgies with high-ranking members, then through the demand to share cult member\u0027s wives, who were suddenly forbidden to deny male members \u0022God\u0027s love\u0022. David then commanded female members to spread God\u0027s love and do missionary work, which centered around \u0022Flirty Fishing\u0022, i.e., having sex with random dudes to encourage them to join the cult. From there, women members, were pushed into \u0022Hooking for Jesus\u0022 - outright prostitution. And from there, members were encouraged to show their children \u0022God\u0027s love\u0022 as outright pedophilia was sanctioned and encouraged, even when it was incestuous. All based on creative Biblical interpretation of course! This people are insane. And you learn all about them in today\u0027s fascinating and mind-boggling edition of Timesuck!

He shocked Victorian and post-Victorian England and the Western World at-large with his \u0022Satanic\u0022 ways. He was permanently banned from both Italy and France before his death. He believed in magic, real magic, and tried to conjure mythical spirits into our world. He performed bizarre \u0022sex magick\u0022 rituals that shocked polite society. He developed the spiritual philosophy of Thelema, built on his guiding principle of \u0022Do What Thou Wilt\u0022. Who was this dark, strange man and how was he able to leave the mark he did on Western Culture? All is revealed! The Great Beast exposed today, on Timesuck.
