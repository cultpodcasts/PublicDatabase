      "description": "Today I explored one of the strangest pieces of Florida history - the Koreshan Unity Settlement, now preserved as Koreshan State Park. This wasn\u0027t just your average utopian commune... these folks believed we live inside the Earth. Yep, hollow Earth theory, celibacy, and a self-proclaimed messiah named Cyrus Teed - it\u0027s wild.\n\nJoin me as I walk through the preserved buildings, talk about the group\u0027s beliefs, and dig into how this cult-like group ended up right here in Estero, Florida. The vibes are equal parts peaceful and eerie, and the history is fascinating.\n\n\uD83C\uDF34 Subscribe for more offbeat Florida adventures, weird history, and budget-friendly travel ideas!\n\n\uD83D\uDD25 Don\u0027t forget to LIKE, COMMENT, and SUBSCRIBE for more epic travel content! \uD83D\uDD25\n\n\uD83C\uDFAC Watch my other videos :\n\uD83D\uDCFA 1.
