      "description": "#npd #narcissist #narcissisticfamilycult #bipolar #mentalillness \n\nHey everybody. My name is Nathan Segal and I want to welcome you to my channel. So chances are you\u0027re looking at the title and you\u0027re thinking how in the world did he come up with that well. It\u0027s both simple and complex, but essentially. \n\nWhen I was 19 years old, I was in a religious cult. Was under this group. They called themselves a born again Christians and they were a part of a church called First Assembly Pentecostal in Calgary. \n\nYears later I was chatting with a friend of mine, a guy by the name of Mike Kropveld, and Mike runs the Citizens Information Center in Montreal and it\u0027s all about helping people who are involved with call groups or want to get out of them? \n\nI was sitting with Mike day and we were talking and he said, I know why you were so susceptible to winding up in a cult. I\u0027m sitting there going. Yeah, really. He said. You grew up in a cult. Your family, your parents were cult leaders. \n\nIt was one of those pie in the face moments that I I have to tell you because I instantly recognized that he was right. And. Explained so much and it also tied into another thing that happened after my mother died. \n\nYou know, I\u0027ve been a part of a group where we were talking about post traumatic stress disorder and for a year, people were yapping about narcissism. Every time they did it were. No, no, I I I don\u0027t want to hear it. Leave me alone. And then my mother died. And then a guy I know by the name of Mark Santos, he sent me a video to a guy by the name of Ross Rosenberg, and he was about covert narcissism.\n\nNow, for decades before that, my family, I was trying to figure out what went wrong, why my family was so weird, why there was so much. What I could see is mental illness. I thought it was bipolar. That\u0027s what seemed to be the diagnosis, but I didn\u0027t know any. I was sitting there one day. I got this video. I watched it and afterwards I just thought oh shit!, because I instantly recognized my mother as a covert narcissist. My father as a narcissist and my brother and all of a sudden everything fell into place and I understood. \n\nAnd that\u0027s where so much of this came from. So anyway, what you\u0027re going to see on this side are snippets of my story. Highlights different things that I learned over the years. \n\nIf you have any questions, reach out to. I\u0027ll do my best to answer them for you, and if you need coaching, I know of a couple of great coaches I can refer you to and I\u0027ve got some great resource material as well. So anyway, thanks for watching and I\u0027ll look forward to any questions you might have. Bye for now.",
