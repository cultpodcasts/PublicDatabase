The Jehova\u0027s Witnesses are changing their messaging from spreading the good news of the coming of the lord to the bad news that it\u0027s too late and your doomed. And we dig deep into the white whale of cults-the Zionist Movement- in a frank discussion of the surprising origins and motivations of the state of Israel and the sinister role christian fundamentalism is playing in the deeply tragic assault of Gaza.

      "description": "Welcome to Cults Anon, the new podcast about cults! We approach the topic of cults and similar high-control groups through the lens of recovery: like a support group for people who no longer want to be in a cult. If you are in a high-control group and are looking for the support and advice on how to leave, or if you want to learn more about cults in order to avoid them in the future, then this is the podcast for you! Join us every Monday for a new episode exposing the toxic traits and strategies of cult leaders, learning the history of various cult organizations, and practicing the techniques of personal autonomy and self realization that foster true individual sovereignty.   In this introductory episode we tackle the basic question: What is a cult? We explain the BITE model developed by behavioral analyst and cult survivor Steven Hassan and the slightly altered BITES model that we will utilize in this podcast going forward as well identifying other common features that make up a cult.
