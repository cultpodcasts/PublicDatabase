      "description": "\u0022The Family\u0022 Cult of Australia\nThe Family cult of Australia, was a new-age religious sect, lead by guru Anne Hamilton-Byrne, on the outskirts of Melbourne,  who taught her followers that she was the re-incarnation of Jesus Christ and that they needed to start a new \u0022master race\u0022 for an impending armageddon.\nBy doing this she convinced her disciples they needed to \u0022adopt\u0022 as many children by whatever means necessary. Sometimes literally stealing new-borns from public hospitals.\n\nLinks/sources:\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/20/growing-up-with-the-family-inside-anne-hamilton-byrnes-sinister-cult\nhttps://www.9news.com.au/national/crime-news-anne-hamilton-byrne-the-family-cult-detective-melbourne-children/b2ee1808-4193-4bb5-bb4e-3881d85a66ab\nhttps://www.fresherslive.com/latest/articles/the-family-cult-where-are-they-now-1555138508\nhttps://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/from-the-archives-1987-police-raid-on-secretive-sect-the-family-20190614-p51xtp.html\nhttps://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/inside-horrifying-family-cult-stole-16542712\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/343363185_Anne_Hamilton-Byrne_and_the_Family\nhttps://www.rescuethefamily.com/blog-posts/reflections-on-the-death-of-anne-hamilton-byrne-on-thursday-13-june-2019\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Family_(Australian_New_Age_group)\nhttps://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=778147\n\nstock footage from:\nhttps://www.storyblocks.com/\nroyalty-free music and sfx from:\nhttps://www.epidemicsound.com/music/featured/\n\nThe Family, Australian true crime, true crime, religious sect, Anne Hamilton-Byrne, The Clearing, cult documentary, australian cult, Kai Lama Loge, Uptop, Sarah Hamilton-Byrne, victoria, Melbourne, shadow matter, Lex De Man, 1980\u0027s Australia, Victoria Police,",
