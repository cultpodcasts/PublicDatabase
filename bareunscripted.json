SCJ\n\nShincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony (SCJ), commonly known as Shincheonji Church of Jesus or simply Shincheonji New Heaven and New Earth, is a new religious movement established in South Korea by Lee Man-hee. It is considered a pseudo-religion or cult by mainstream churches.\n\nShincheonji\u0027s teachings and beliefs claim that their founder Lee is the pastor promised in the New Testament and that the Book of Revelation is written in secret metaphors (parables) which only Lee is capable of deciphering.  This is what Jesus warned about in Matthew 7:15 and Matthew 24:24 about false prophets coming in sheep\u2019s clothing but are ravenous wolves, and those in this movement believe they speak on behalf of Christ as a witness!\n\nShincheonji pretends to be Christian and yet denies the Trinity and the Deity of Christ, claiming that it was a man-made concept invented by the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD, while demoting Jesus to be a \u0022Promised Pastor\u0022 or basically a prophet.  They believe that their leader, Lee Man-hee, is the \u0022Advocate\u0022 mentioned in John 14:16, and that salvation can only be found through his Testimony and organization.  \n\nThe apostle Paul warned about those who preach a different/another gospel in Galatians 1:6-9 which the Shincheonji Church of Jesus is teaching leading many people astray into a false religious Cult.\n\nThis group is currently infiltrating churches throughout the world, using deceptive wolf in sheep\u0027s clothing tactics to propagate.
