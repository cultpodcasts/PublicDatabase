      "description": "I did not see the red flags. \n\nHello listeners! In need of advice? Well, you came to the right place! Dear Pod is a comedy podcast that revisits the bygone era of newspaper advice columns and looks at them through contemporary eyes and dry humor. Join your hosts Patrick and Erin as they time travel back to when print wasn\u0027t dead. People took pen to paper seeking advice from women with high cheekbones and no bedside manner. And if you\u0027re searching for wisdom, your hosts will channel Ann Landers and Dear Abby and offer their help to you! But instead of sending a self addressed, stamped envelope to a PO Box, you only need to email your questions to dearpodofficial@gmail.com. Your problem may get featured on the air! Thanks for checking out our fancy website, bub! Take a seat on our plastic covered furniture and stay a while! No shoes on the carpet!\n\n#dearpod #podcast #comedy #comedypodcast",
