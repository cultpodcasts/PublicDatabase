      "description": "On this episode of Mormonish Podcast, Rebecca and Landon are joined by the wonderful Simon Southerton to discuss updates to DNA research that further confirms what we already know about The Book of Mormon and Israelite DNA.\n\nThe Book of Mormon posits that some or all Native Americans are descended from Israelites who migrated to the Americas. However, DNA studies of modern Native Americans show no significant genetic links to Middle Eastern populations, leading to debates about the Book of Mormon\u0027s historical accuracy. \n\nThe Book of Mormon describes migrations of Israelites to the Americas, including groups like the Jaredites, Nephites, and Lamanites, who were said to be the \u0022principal ancestors\u0022 of the Native Americans and now said to be \u0022among\u0022 the ancestors of the Native Americans as DNA continues to challenge this narrative.\n\nAdvances in DNA studies continue to show that most Native American populations have strong genetic links to East Asian populations, with no evidence of Middle Eastern ancestry.\n\nThank you so much for watching Mormonish Podcast!\n\n***How to DONATE to Mormonish Podcast:   \n \nIf you would like to help financially support our podcast, you can DONATE to support Mormonish Podcast here:    \n\nMormonish Podcast is a 501(c) (3) \n\nhttps://donorbox.org/mormonish-podcast     \n\n****WE HAVE MERCH! **** \n  \nIf you\u2019d like to purchase Mormonish Merch, you can visit our Merch store here:        \n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/mormonishmerch     \n\nWe appreciate our Mormonish viewers and listeners so much!   \nDon\u0027t forget to LIKE and SUBSCRIBE to Mormonish Podcast!     \n\nContact Mormonish Podcast: mormonishpodcast@gmail.com   \n\n#mormonish #lds #mormon #exmormon #postmormon #religion #news, #ldschurch #comeuntochrist #churchofjesuschrist #churchofjesuschristoflatterdaysaints #byu #byui #josephsmith #comefollowme #polygamy #bookofmormon #becauseofhim #hearhim #ldstemple\n\nFAIR USE DISCLAIMER All Media in this video (including the thumbnail) is used for the purpose of review and critique.

      "description": "On this episode of Mormonish Podcast, Rebecca and Landon are joined by former LDS missionary, Tanner Talbot as we take a deep dive into the Arizona Tucson Mission circa 2016. Tanner was the 54th missionary to be sent home by the mission president, who had been serving for only 21 months at the time. This alarmingly high rate of missionary turnover reveals a darker underside to what was occurring. Tanner discusses how missionaries already struggling with mental health broke under the pressure of the strict programs being implemented turning the mission into anarchy. Attempted murder, self-harm, sexual predators to minors, sexual assault, theft, destruction of property, assault and battery, and more were happening by missionaries in the Arizona Tucson Mission. Most instances seemed like they were left unpunished and were quietly swept away.

      "description": "On this episode of Mormonish Podcast, Rebecca and Landon are \njoined by Unoriginal Jim to discuss the important story of The Hill \nCumorah and the complete lack of any kind of evidence at that location.\n\nMormonism came forth in an environment where the origin and\nidentity of indigenous populations was highly questioned. There\nwere several books published between the 16th century and the\n1830s that promoted the idea that Native Americans were either\nseafaring Jews or members of the lost 12 tribes. At the same\ntime many of the same publications promoted the\nMoundbuilders myth.\n\nThe Book of Mormon did not attempt to provide scientific or\narchaeological evidence. Joseph Smith presented the Book of\nMormon as the proof of Native American history and blended\nboth theories\n\nThe Hill Cumorah narrative draws from these contemporary\ntheories and presents them as a historical fact.\n\nIt is central to the text and to Smith\u0027s entire message and the\nidentity of the church. And it is a falsifiable claim.\n\nThank you so much for watching Mormonish Podcast!\n\n***How to DONATE to Mormonish Podcast:   \n \nIf you would like to help financially support our podcast, you can DONATE to support Mormonish Podcast here:    \n\nMormonish Podcast is a 501(c) (3) \n\nhttps://donorbox.org/mormonish-podcast     \n\n****WE HAVE MERCH! **** \n  \nIf you\u2019d like to purchase Mormonish Merch, you can visit our Merch store here:        \n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/mormonishmerch     \n\nWe appreciate our Mormonish viewers and listeners so much!   \nDon\u0027t forget to LIKE and SUBSCRIBE to Mormonish Podcast!     \n\nContact Mormonish Podcast: mormonishpodcast@gmail.com   \n\n#mormonish #lds #mormon #exmormon #postmormon #religion #news, #ldschurch #comeuntochrist #churchofjesuschrist #churchofjesuschristoflatterdaysaints #byu #byui #josephsmith #comefollowme #polygamy #bookofmormon #becauseofhim #hearhim #ldstemple\n\nFAIR USE DISCLAIMER All Media in this video (including the thumbnail) is used for the purpose of review and critique.

      "description": "On this episode of Mormonish Podcast, Rebecca and Landon are joined by the wonderful Doug Vincent to discuss a much overlooked powerful influence on Joseph Smith and the origins of Mormonism itself, the Erie Canal.\nDuring Joseph Smith\u0027s formative years, the Smith family lived in Palmyra New York. In describing Joseph\u0027s youth, there is little mention of the influence living so close to such a wonder of modern engineering, the Erie Canal, had on him. \nThe Erie Canal was the internet of its day. It was a super highway of goods, services, news, people, ideas, religion, ancient curiosities, and more. Joseph\u0027s family sold cakes and root beer in a stand along the canal and would have had direct contact with all of this. The canal had three stops in Palmyra so its influence permeated the entire town of Palmyra.\nThe Erie Canal is not only responsible for the phenomenon known as The Burned Over District, where multiple religions and movements began, but it shaped the foundational ideas of Mormonism itself and \u0022educated\u0022 Joseph in a ways that are often overlooked in the narrative of an \u0022uneducated farm boy.\u0022",

We had special knowledge.\n\nBut where did this special knowledge come from? And why don\u0027t we hear this date mentioned at all anymore?\n\nCharley shows us the origins of the April 6th claim and how it became gospel truth only to slowly slip out of use in recent decades.

Randy Bell is the owner of the world\u0027s largest collection of Houdini artifacts and uses these amazing items to take us on a journey through the history of magic tricks and magical stunts. As we learn more about how magic actually works, we come to understand that magicians follow a set pattern to trick their audiences. Radio Free Mormon demonstrates a phenomenal magic trick that left us speechless to illustrate this point. Ethical magic is used by magicians to deceive an audience that wants to be deceived. This is entertainment. Mormonism uses tricks too, often on an unsuspecting audience that believes the deception with lasting, lifetime consequences. Join us for this phenomenal presentation from Dr. Randy Bell and RFM as we delve into magic, manipulation, and Mormonism.\n\n (This episode was originally aired on December 23, 2023.

      "description": "On this episode of Mormonish Podcast, Rebecca and Landon are joined by Nemo the Mormon to discuss a hot button issue in the McKinney Texas Temple scenario, the United Methodist Church Bell Tower ordinance. \nThis issue is very easy to misunderstand so we take everyone carefully through the Fairview Town Council and Fairview Planning \u0026 Zoning Board meeting minutes step by step. Our hope to clarify the confusion and help everyone understand what actually happened with the United Methodist bell tower over the last 18 years. \nThe LDS church seems to want to use this as precedence that would allow them to build a 173 ft tall steeple. In the simplest terms, while the town council back in the day did comment that they didn\u0027t have a problem with the belltower, they then would have followed the process to send the plan back to Planning \u0026 Zoning to work on issues related to codes like the height and decibel of the bells.\nNothing was approved, nothing was signed with final signatures for height and decibel and the tower was never built. Eleven years later the Methodist church built a much smaller tower. \n(This episode originally aired last year but the \u0022bell tower defense\u0022 continues to be used over and over by faithful Mormons. It\u0027s important to understand the truth.)\nThank you so much for watching Mormonish Podcast!\n***How to DONATE to Mormonish Podcast:    \nIf you would like to help financially support our podcast, you can DONATE to support Mormonish Podcast here:    \nMormonish Podcast is a 501(c) (3) \nhttps://donorbox.org/mormonish-podcast     \n****WE HAVE MERCH! ****   \nIf you\u2019d like to purchase Mormonish Merch, you can visit our Merch store here:        \nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/mormonishmerch     \nWe appreciate our Mormonish viewers and listeners so much!   \nDon\u0027t forget to LIKE and SUBSCRIBE to Mormonish Podcast!     \nContact Mormonish Podcast: mormonishpodcast@gmail.com   \n#mormonish #lds #mormon #exmormon #postmormon #religion #news, #ldschurch #comeuntochrist #churchofjesuschrist #churchofjesuschristoflatterdaysaints #byu #byui #josephsmith #comefollowme #polygamy #bookofmormon #becauseofhim #hearhim #ldstemple\nFAIR USE DISCLAIMER All Media in this video (including the thumbnail) is used for the purpose of review and critique.

      "description": "(Mormonish has had many people reach out and ask about this episode since I mentioned it on The Mormon Newscast. Because of renewed interest, we\u0027re reposting it a year and a half later.)\nA favorite Mormonish returning guest, Rob Lauer, told us about his experiences as a theater major at BYU in the early 1980s. \nThe late 1970s and 1980s were a difficult time for LGBT students who were attending BYU. They were hunted down and entrapped and forced to live a hidden life or be removed from school. \nRob described an off campus house, affectionately called, \u0022The Beaver Cleaver\u0022 house, where several LGBT theater majors lived together and dealt with the difficult environment that existed at BYU during that time. The bright spot in this whole era was their connection with each other and the life long friendships they formed. \nWe asked Rob if he thought his former roommates might ever consider coming on our podcast to share their experiences. Rob told us he was in contact with these wonderful men, but they had never spoken publicly about that era at BYU. But he would ask them. \nUnbelievably, the roommates felt ready to tell their stories and we are so honored to have them on Mormonish Podcast as they reconnect with each other, reminisce, work through some difficult trauma, and share their wonderful humor and positive outlook today even as they look back on the pain they experienced. \nYou will be forever changed by this episode, I know we were.\n***How to DONATE to Mormonish Podcast:    \nIf you would like to help financially support our podcast, you can DONATE to support Mormonish Podcast here:    \nMormonish Podcast is a 501(c) (3) \nhttps://donorbox.org/mormonish-podcast     \n\n****WE HAVE MERCH! **** \n  \nIf you\u2019d like to purchase Mormonish Merch, you can visit our Merch store here:        \n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/mormonishmerch     \n\nWe appreciate our Mormonish viewers and listeners so much!   \nDon\u0027t forget to LIKE and SUBSCRIBE to Mormonish Podcast!     \n\nContact Mormonish Podcast: mormonishpodcast@gmail.com   \n\n#mormonish #lds #mormon #exmormon #postmormon #religion #news, #ldschurch #comeuntochrist #churchofjesuschrist #churchofjesuschristoflatterdaysaints #byu #byui #josephsmith #comefollowme #polygamy #bookofmormon #becauseofhim #hearhim #ldstemple\n\nFAIR USE DISCLAIMER All Media in this video (including the thumbnail) is used for the purpose of review and critique.

      "description": "With renewed interest in The Nauvoo Expositor affidavits as a \u201Csilver bullet\u201D for proving Joseph Smith practiced polygamy, Mormonish is releasing its episode with RFM debuting his groundbreaking evidence about the polygamy affidavits contained in the Expositor.  No one breaks down the evidence quite like RFM and by the end of the episode you\u2019ll understand why the terms \u201Csmoking gun\u201D and \u201Csilver bullet\u201D are accurately applied in this case.\n\nDid Joseph Smith record D\u0026C 132, the revelation on plural marriage? A growing number of members of the church and splinter groups believe that Joseph Smith did not practice polygamy, but rather, this practice was instituted by Brigham Young. They also believe that any written record of Joseph\u0027s polygamy, including D\u0026C 132 was created by someone other than Joseph  to make it appear that Joseph Smith practiced polygamy. \n\nRFM\u0027s comparison between their description of D\u0026C 132, as stated in the affidavits, and D\u0026C 132 itself makes it clear that this document must have existed during Joseph Smith\u0027s lifetime.

      "description": "On this episode of Mormonish Podcast, Rebecca and Landon are joined by the founder of QuitMormon, Mark Naugle, for an extremely informative discussion on one of the most important tools in post Mormondom! QuitMormon is a website that helps facilitate removing your records from the LDS church and effectively ending your membership. The fact that this kind of procedure, including the use of notary, is required to leave a religious organization is problematic in itself. Mark takes us through his background of leaving the church as a teenager and then making it his mission to help others do the same for almost a decade. Mark shares his vision for QuitMormon that involves even more help and support to the post Mormon community. He also discusses their new fundraising efforts and hopes for the future. If you\u0027ve even wondered who was behind QuitMormon and where it came from, you won\u0027t want to miss this episode. Thank you to my friend Cara for suggesting this great idea for a podcast!

Ron explains this emerging concept of multiple mortalities and plural probations that the prophet only shared with his inner circle. \n\nHad he lived, these Kabbalistic teachings might have ended up as mainstream LDS doctrine. Who knows.

Many books and videos have been produced on this topic and Mormonish wanted to understand exactly what that connection was. Join us for an informative and revelatory look at the Pilgrims and their destiny.

      "description": "We have gotten so many questions recently about the LDS Giving Machine, especially from never Mormons, we decided to repost our episode from last year!\nOn this episode of Mormonish podcast, Rebecca and Landon are joined by accounting professor, Dr. Spencer Anderson as we explore the truth behind the LDS Giving Machine\u2019s that are popping up in cities all over the United States! On the surface Giving Machines seem to be a fun and festive way to donate to people in need. However, questions have arisen over the use of these machines to generate publicity for the church itself. Is the LDS Church simply a middle man taking credit for someone else\u2019s generosity? Rebecca and Landon talk with an Executive Director of a nonprofit who received donations from the Giving Machine program. They also take a field trip to the mall to try out the Giving Machine themselves. What we learned might surprise you, so make sure to tune in.\nLink to Professor Spencer\u0027s episode on ethics.\nhttps://youtu.be/J85u7ujIEb8?si=CggRc0ynsxb2AwuB\n***How to DONATE to Mormonish Podcast:\n If you would like to help financially support our podcast, you can DONATE to support Mormonish Podcast here:\nDONATE THROUGH DONORBOX\nhttps://donorbox.org/mormonish-podcast\nMormonish Podcast is a 501(c) (3) \nhttps://donorbox.org/mormonish-podcast\n ****WE HAVE MERCH! ****\n If you\u2019d like to purchase Mormonish Merch, you can visit our Merch store here: \nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/mormonishmerch \nWe appreciate our Mormonish viewers and listeners so much! \nDon\u0027t forget to LIKE and SUBSCRIBE to Mormonish Podcast. \nYou can contact Mormonish Podcast at: mormonishpodcast@gmail.com\nFAIR USE DISCLAIMER All Media in this video (including the thumbnail) is used for the purpose of review and critique.

Each time the story changes and the details seem to get more and more dramatic. Our aviation expert takes a look at what documentation we have for this flight, and more importantly, what documentation is missing.

Members of the LDS church were excited and speculated as to where it would be located. The temple site was announced and the renderings of the new temple made available in April of 2020. It was to be built in the small town of Erda, UT with only 3,000 residents and a completely rural environment. But that wasn\u0027t all... It was soon announced that there would be a 167-acre pedestrian-oriented community right next to the temple. With 446 units ranging from single-family homes on half acre lots to townhouses and 54 senior housing units. Residents of Erda were excited for a temple, but not the accompanying housing development. Could they have one without the other?

Roberts and his run for an 1895 congressional seat. This chapter in church history needs more daylight shone on it. At odds with the brethren over the church\u2019s interference with the election, B.H. Roberts was suspended from ecclesiastical office and eventually forced to sign The Political Manifesto of 1895 or face excommunication. For those who doubt the relationship between church and state in the early church, this is just one of many examples of the LDS faith\u0027s influence and control over politics in Utah and beyond. Mormonish Podcast cohosts Rebecca and Landon are joined again by church history buff, Master Peace (Ron Yorgason), as we delve deeper into the ongoing conflict between church and state as Utah struggled to gain statehood.

      "description": "On this episode of Mormonish Podcast, Rebecca and Landon discuss the most traumatic event of our guest, Dave Frei\u0027s life and the lasting effects. \nDave was a young LDS missionary in early 2004 when he was brutally attacked, robbed, and held at gunpoint in a remote area of Brazil.\nThinking he could just move past the even and continue with his mission, Dave was suddenly sidelined by crippling PTSD which he wouldn\u0027t recognize until much later.\nThe larger conversation is the safety of missionaries in general and aftercare when a traumatic event happens. This was a fascinating discussion and a very important dialogue.\n***How to DONATE to Mormonish Podcast:\n If you would like to help financially support our podcast, you can DONATE to support Mormonish Podcast here:\nMormonish Podcast is a 501(c) (3) https://donorbox.org/mormonish-podcast\n ****WE HAVE MERCH! ****\n If you\u2019d like to purchase Mormonish Merch, you can visit our Merch store here: https://www.etsy.com/shop/mormonishmerch \nWe appreciate our Mormonish viewers and listeners so much! \nDon\u0027t forget to LIKE and SUBSCRIBE to Mormonish Podcast. \nYou can contact Mormonish Podcast at: mormonishpodcast@gmail.com\nFAIR USE DISCLAIMER All Media in this video (including the thumbnail) is used for the purpose of review and critique.

The LDS church uses this law to intimidate towns by insinuating that their zoning ordinances and laws are superseded by RLUIPA and the church can sue towns if they can\u0027t build the temple they want, even when it exceeds established zoning codes.\nBut is this really the case? Our discussion in this episode digs into what RLUIPA actually says and what it allows. It\u0027s a complex issue but Kolby is able to shed some real light on the law and its uses.

      "description": "On this episode of Mormonish Podcast, Landon and Rebecca watch the Fairview Texas Town Council Meeting and provide insightful commentary. The Town Council meeting was held on June 4th, 2024 in Fairview Texas. On the meeting agenda is the LDS church\u0027s request to build a 63 ft building with a 171 ft spire in a residential neighborhood. Emotions run high as residents of Fairview and LDS members who live in Fairview both petition the Town Council to understand their points of view. Landon and Rebecca were on a livestream episode of Mormon Stories where we streamed part of the meeting. We had many people reach out and tell us they would like to see the rest of the meeting and the beginning of the meeting. This is that meeting in its entirety with commentary from Mormonish who has been following the events in Fairview and four other towns where LDS temples are being built. There is so much to be learned from this meeting. ***How to DONATE to Mormonish Podcast: If you would like to help financially support our podcast, you can DONATE to support Mormonish Podcast here: Mormonish Podcast is a 501(c) (3) https://donorbox.org/mormonish-podcast ****WE HAVE MERCH! **** If you\u2019d like to purchase Mormonish Merch, you can visit our Merch store here: https://www.etsy.com/shop/mormonishmerch We appreciate our Mormonish viewers and listeners so much!

He specifically explores the (mis)appropriation of haka by a group of Latter-day Saint missionaries in Wangarratta, Australia, who wrote and performed an English-language haka that can be viewed as violent and offensive to those who understand the true significance of the haka. We also discuss the LDS church and white patriarchal salvation, framed by the use of the haka by white LDS missionaries. This is very interesting topic and we\u0027re very glad that Dr. Simon was able to join us for an episode of Mormonish. ***How to DONATE to Mormonish Podcast: If you would like to help financially support our podcast, you can DONATE to support Mormonish Podcast here: https://www.mormonishpodcast.org/support Also at: PayPal: https://paypal.me/BiblioTechMedia?cou...

Using clues and markers from the replacement text for the missing 116 pages, Ganesh provides some really intriguing information regarding the actual timeline of Book of Mormon composition and the formation of the early Church of Christ, later known as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The clues to the actual origin of the LDS church that are held within the replacement text, paint a very different picture of the early organization of the church.

We were so honored to find four married LDS LGBTQ couples who wanted to share their stories.\u00A0\nWhen you hear these stories together, it\u0027s clear that local leadership struggles with no clear direction from the top or any formal policy. What you are left with is a roulette situation and the lives of LGBTQ are negatively impacted.\u00A0\nAs we watch these four stories, we are struck by the desire of these couples to remain in the church and in their LDS community. Each story is different, with varying levels of participation allowed, which makes it all the more poinant.\u00A0\u00A0\nGet ready to be really impacted by our wonderful guests tonight!\u00A0\n***How to DONATE to Mormonish Podcast:\u00A0\nIf you would like to help financially support our podcast, you can DONATE to support Mormonish Podcast here:\n\u00A0\nhttps://www.mormonishpodcast.org/support\n\u00A0\nAlso at: PayPal:\u00A0https://paypal.me/BiblioTechMedia?cou...\nVenmo: @BiblioTechMedia\n\u00A0\n****WE HAVE MERCH! **** If you\u2019d like to purchase Mormonish Merch, you can visit our Merch store here:\u00A0https://www.etsy.com/shop/mormonishmerch\u00A0\nWe appreciate our Mormonish viewers and listeners so much!\u00A0\nDon\u0027t forget to LIKE and SUBSCRIBE to Mormonish Podcast!\u00A0\nContact Mormonish Podcast:\u00A0mormonishpodcast@gmail.com",

The sealing keys are a foundational element of the LDS church\u0027s core doctrine. It\u0027s interesting to explore the origins of this story.

The comments indicated that they were disappointed in the statement and refused to be gaslit. Mormonish discusses this almost unprecedented reaction and also shares stories we have gathered from social media from LDS women who have experienced the power structure and the lack of power for women within the LDS church.

And its also often said that the existence of this allegory in the Book of Mormon proves that the book has ancient roots (no pun intended.) \nGanesh and the Mormonish team dive into the text as we deconstruct the allegory\u2019s words and phrases themselves to unravel the mystery.\nLinks to Book of Mormon Central\u0027s Documentary Series: A Marvelous Work:\nThe Greatness of the Evidence | A Marvelous Work | Episode 1\nhttps://youtu.be/6030mVPhoaw?si=O1H90x28jjhQ-7Xg\nHebrew Evidence for The Book of Mormon | A Marvelous Work | Episode 2\nhttps://youtu.be/hXtUbMg0BXg?si=oN2ztlwT3S3LLxO9\nLinks to Ganesh\u0027s Podcasts and Tik Tok Videos:\nCome Follow Me\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWvn1t6rr0knDAjAVks5lYxKLC_vjtJ2k\u0026si=9rbpHAH_udeJscue\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@ganeshcherian/video/7318885582548045057\n***How to DONATE to Mormonish Podcast: \nIf you would like to help financially support our podcast, you can DONATE to support Mormonish Podcast here: \nhttps://www.mormonishpodcast.org/support \nAlso at: PayPal: https://paypal.me/BiblioTechMedia?cou...\nVenmo: @BiblioTechMedia \n****WE HAVE MERCH! **** If you\u2019d like to purchase Mormonish Merch, you can visit our Merch store here: https://www.etsy.com/shop/mormonishmerch \nWe appreciate our Mormonish viewers and listeners so much! \nDon\u0027t forget to LIKE and SUBSCRIBE to Mormonish Podcast! \nContact Mormonish Podcast: mormonishpodcast@gmail.com",

Both cities have active citizens\u0027 groups who are going through proper legal channels to try to change the proposed temple sites to locations more in line with zoning regulations and the look and feel of the town. It\u0027s very interesting to look at these two situations as a whole. The church is using very similar strategies in each city to make sure their planned temples are built as intended. A lot can be learned from awareness of both situations.

Aaron Sherinian was announced as the new church spokeman on January 9th, 2024 and stated on LinkedIn that he would start his new role immediately. Rebecca and Landon search social media to discover evidence that he has started acting in his new capacity, if any exists. Controvery erupted following the annoucement after it was discovered Aaron posted pictures of himself at a Pride Parade and made pother posts about being an ally to the LGBTQ community. Progressive Mormons thought this choice of church spokesman pointed to more inclucivity and a positive step forward. More conservative Mormons questioned whether this choice was appropriate. Silence on the part of Aaron only leads to more questions.

      "description": "On Part II of this extremely informative episode of Mormonish Podcast, Rebecca and Landon sit down with our knowledgeable friend, Andrew Schnobrich, to do a deep, yet accessible dive into The Book of Abraham. Andrew has created a slide show and presentation that helps all of us more clearly understand the overwhelming problems with the BOA translation and Joseph Smith\u0027s claim to have translated it from Reformed Egyptian. Andrew\u0027s comprehensive slide presentation takes us through this translation process step by step, to help us understand the multiple problems and discrepancies that exist in what is supposed to be a prophetic translation of a record written by Moses\u0027 own hand. Once you understand the real meaning of the characters and the drawings, it becomes obvious Joseph Smith did not translate this papyri correctly by any stretch of the imagination. This creates a big problem for the Pearl of Great Price and the LDS church itself. This is Part II of a two part series on The Book of Abraham.

This situation has brought up many different avenues of discussion, including the liability of individual members as they fulfill their callings. This is something most members don\u0027t think about, but there are many scenarios where one might find themselves in a difficult situation. Kolby weighs in on the legal ramifications of clergy penitent privilege and calling the LDS church legal hot line in cases of abuse. He also tells us more about individual member liability, We learned so much from Kolby and we know you will too.

We\u0027re excited to engage in this peer review process and learn a number of new things in the process.This analysis of neophyte scripture substantiates Dr. Lundwall\u2019s argument that the historical text itself is the most anachronistic element of the Book of Mormon.Dr. Murphy explores the important perspective that time and place matter. He shares important information on neophyte scriptures that existed at the time and place of the Book of Mormon\u0027s 1830 publication in Palmyra, NY.We also discuss the idea that because Joseph Smith did not disclose his interactions with living Iroquois neophytes and instead represented his sources as dead Nephites, the Book of Mormon functions as a destructive tool of European settler colonialism. Dr. Murphy\u0027s analysis of neophyte scripture substantiates Dr. Lundwall\u2019s argument that the historical text itself is the most anachronistic element of the Book of Mormon and introduces even more compelling evidence of how the Book of Mormon was actually created.

We explore the broader picture of a church that appears to say one thing from the pulpit and then by their actions, indicate another point of view. This is causing a lot of confusion among more conservative and orthodox members of the church and the more progressive members. We agree that everyone is completely justified in their confusion. When you are operating in a theocracy that you look to for instructons on how to live your life and even what opinions and beliefs you should hold, confusing or mixed messages from the top is not acceptable.

I can\u0027t. So I need to step down,\u0022 we felt there was a larger conversation to be had here. Utilizing the Natasha\u0027s expertise, we delve into the harm of invasive sexual questions between a bishop and the youth, as well as adults. We discuss the complete lack of training a bishop receives that makes him totally unqualified to be counseling anyone on these sensitive and complex issues. We also learn about Joel\u0027s time as a bishop and the moral dilemmas he faced before he ultimately asked to be released from his calling. His insights from this perspective are something we don\u0027t hear often enough. This was a really important conversation as each panelist shared details of their own personal experiences and more ***How to DONATE to Mormonish Podcast: If you would like to financially support our podcast, you can DONATE to support Mormonish Podcast here: https://www.mormonishpodcast.org/support Also at: PayPal: https://paypal.me/BiblioTechMedia Venmo: @BiblioTechMedia We appreciate our Mormonish viewers and listeners so much!

In the final episode of our series with Dr. John Lundwall, Lundwall responds to questions and comments as he discusses the differences between oral and literate cultures and what a \u0022tight\u0022 and \u0022loose\u0022 translation means for the Book of Mormon. Further, Lundwall shows that the standard of Proof for the Book of Mormon was established by the Mormon prophets themselves and resides in its historicity. If the Book of Mormon is not historical then the Mormon Church is not true. The Book of Mormon\u0027s historicity is testable, however, the Church repeatedly moves arguments of historicity to the untestable. As long as they do this, they will always have an argument to make, and listeners to the podcast will have to decide for themselves on which arguments to follow. ***How to DONATE to Mormonish Podcast: If you would like to financially support our podcast, you can DONATE to support Mormonish Podcast here: https://www.mormonishpodcast.org/support Also at: PayPal: https://paypal.me/BiblioTechMedia Venmo: @BiblioTechMedia We appreciate our Mormonish viewers and listeners so much!

Randy Bell is the owner of the world\u0027s largest collection of Houdini artifacts and uses these amazing items to take us on a journey through the history of magic tricks and magical stunts. As we learn more about how magic actually works, we come to understand that magicians follow a set pattern to trick their audiences. Radio Free Mormon demonstrates a phenomenal magic trick that left us speechless to illustrate this point. Ethical magic is used by magicians to deceive an audience that wants to be deceived. This is entertainment. Mormonism uses tricks too, often on an unsuspecting audience that believes the deception with lasting, lifetime consequences. Join us for this phenomenal presentation from Dr. Randy Bell and RFM as we delve into magic, manipulation, and Mormonism. ***How to DONATE to Mormonish Podcast: If you would like to financially support our podcast, you can DONATE to support Mormonish Podcast here: https://www.mormonishpodcast.org/support Also at: PayPal: https://paypal.me/BiblioTechMedia Venmo: @BiblioTechMedia We appreciate our Mormonish viewers and listeners so much!

      "description": "On this episode of Mormonish Podcast, Rebecca and Landon discuss their experience going to see the movie, \u0022The Oath,\u0022 which opened in theaters nationwide on Friday, December 8th. According to Rotten Tomatoes the movie is described as follows. \u0022400 A.D., in a forgotten time of Ancient America, a lone Hebraic fugitive must preserve the history of his fallen nation while being hunted by a ruthless tyrant but rescuing the King\u0027s abused mistress could awaken a warrior\u0027s past. The movie is directed, produced, and starred in by Darin Scott who has been a part of many LDS themed movies. This movie has been over a decade in the making and has a unique story of its own. Seeing the Book of Mormon portrayed on the big screen is always interesting, but this movie is something different. Please let us know what your thought on \u0022The Oath\u0022 are? Did you see it? Will you see it? How so you feel about the LDS founding scripture being portrayed on the big screen? ***How to DONATE to Mormonish Podcast: If you would like to financially support our podcast, you can DONATE to support Mormonish Podcast here: https://www.mormonishpodcast.org/support Also at: PayPal: https://paypal.me/BiblioTechMedia Venmo: @BiblioTechMedia We appreciate our Mormonish viewers and listeners so much!

On the surface Giving Machines seem to be a fun and festive way to donate to people in need. However, questions have arisen over the use of these machines to generate publicity for the church itself. Is the LDS Church simply a middle man taking credit for someone else\u2019s generosity? Rebecca and Landon talk with an Executive Director of a nonprofit who received donations from the Giving Machine program. They also take a field trip to the mall to try out the Giving Machine themselves. What we learned might surprise you, so make sure to tune in.

Social media is buzzing with the news that a decade old tradition of having women in leadership sit on the stand during LDS sacrament meeting in the Bay Area, came to an end abruptly with a cease and desist order from the church. Margaret shares her invaluable perspective on the ongoing struggle for equality that women in the church face, and the historical patterns she has observed.

We discuss the concept that spirituality is a human need and is connected to the myths that join us together. Once we truly are able to connect to ourselves we can not only find purpose and meaning in life, we can also face difficulties along the way. Britt shares her own faith journey and the valuable lessons she learned along the way. We also discuss the state of religion in general, especially in terms of generational differences between Gen X, Millennials, and Gen Z. This was a wonderfully enlightening conversation and also very timely as Britt shares positive strategies to navigate sometimes difficult family or interpersonal dynamics that arise during the holidays.

      "description": "Mormonish is so excited to have reached our 100th episode! And this is probably one of the most unique, wonderful, and emotional episodes of Mormonish Podcast we have ever taped. A few months ago Landon and Rebecca interviewed the wonderful playwright Rob Lauer, who told us about his experiences as a theater major at BYU in the early 1980s. The late 1970s and 1980s were a difficult time for LGBT students who were attending BYU. They were hunted down and entrapped and forced to live a hidden life or be removed from school. During that episode, Rob described an off campus house, affectionately called, \u0022The Beaver Cleaver\u0022 house, where several LGBT theater majors lived together and dealt with the difficult environment that existed at BYU during that time. The bright spot in this whole era was their connection with each other and the life long friendships they formed. We asked Rob if he thought his former roommates might ever consider coming on our podcast to share their experiences. Rob told us he was in contact with these wonderful men, but they had never spoken publicly about that era at BYU. But he would ask them. Unbelievably, the roommates felt ready to tell their stories and we are so honored to have them on Mormonish Podcast as they reconnect with each other, reminisce, work through some difficult trauma, and share their wonderful humor and positive outlook today even as they look back on the pain they experienced.

We also discuss the Prop 8 era when wealthier LDS members were called upon to give money to a third party political entity to influence a vote, and both Randy and Sophronia share their personal stories.

This topic is more relevant than ever as we seem to see a growing faction of Mormonism embracing white Christian nationalism. In the mid-twentieth century, Ezra Taft Benson was a deeply controversial figure who served not only as Secretary of Agriculture under Dwight Eisenhower but also as a member the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\u2019 Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.His ongoing battle to preach against communism and warn memebers that the United States was on the road to moral decay, put him at odds with many both politically and within the church. The prophet and other members of the Quorum attempted to discipline Benson for allowing his political views to influence his religious leadership, but he continued to advocate for the John Birch Society and other radical causes, while promoting Christian nationalism. Benson\u0027s legacy lives on today and even seems to be gaining momentum, as illustrated by the recent OUR and Tim Ballard information that has come to light.

And that was by design. In this revelatory episode we discuss how each of the First Vision accounts differ, why no one seemed to know anything about any account until years later, how the church wants to spin the narrative that conflicting accounts actually make the experience more true, and more. As we read through the essay and dissect each part, a larger picture of a coverup begins to emerge. The hero\u0027s of the situation are Jerald and Sandra Tanner whose unwavering scholarship forced church leaders to eventually admit that more than one account of the First Vision existed and had been kept from the public. Some of this information can hardly be believed as we explore each twist and turn in this must-see episode.

      "description": "On this episode of Mormonish Podcast, Rebecca and Landon are joined by the wonderful Kolby Reddish as we dive in to the importance of epistemology as a method to determine truthfulness. There is a growing concept in the LDS church that the more something appears to not be true, that only proves it\u0027s truth more strongly. And of course, faith strengthens this idea. Kolby shares his thoughts and experiences with epistemology and explains how this tool to determine truth is invaluable. Epistemology is defined as \u0022the theory of knowledge, especially with regard to its methods, validity, and scope. Epistemology is the investigation of what distinguishes justified belief from opinion and it can teach us how to avoid believing things, even true things, for bad reasons. The longest standing definition of knowledge dates back clear to ancient Greek philosophy as \u0022justified true belief.\u0022 That means believing something that is consistent with reality for good reasons. As Sasha Sagan says, \u0022It\u0027s dangerous to believe things just because you want them to be true.\u0022 And this is where we need to consider what our epistemic standards are: at what point are we justified in believing something? What is the most common standard in Mormonism for believing truth claims? We know you\u0027ll find this episode as fascinating as we did!

      "description": "On this breaking news episode of Mormonish Podcast, Rebecca and Landon explore two news articles about Elder M. Russell Ballard\u0027s relationship to Tim Ballard, that were released in local and national media and then suddenly taken down. In an effort to determine why the article would have been pulled so quickly, we fact check the article itself and other related statements from the Church. We also delve into the question of whether the media in Utah and perhaps even nationally to some degree, is controlled by the LDS church. How far is their reach and how does this affect the average citizen\u0027s right to information. Mormonish explores all sides of this issue in this explosive episode.

      "description": "On this episode of Mormonish Podcast, Rebecca and Landon sit down with Autumn (not her real name) as she tells us a disturbing story of spiritual grooming and manipulation in her marriage to a faithful Mormon. As a convert to the church and a young wife, Autumn experienced the kind of grooming we have heard about recently in the Tim Ballard lawsuit. When you give up your power to a person in authority over you and an institution, you can lose all sense of self and often reason. Autumn\u2019s story is very disturbing and many will probably find it very triggering. But it\u2019s an important story to tell in order to shine a spotlight on this type of grooming behavior that happens everyday. And often goes in noticed unless you experience it yourself. We really appreciate Autumn\u2019s vulnerability and openness as she discusses this very difficult topic. She\u2019s a wonderful person!

      "description": "On this episode of Mormonish Podcast, we sit down with the wonderful Randy Bell, the Master of Disaster, to talk about the recent Faith Matters: Restore conference held in Utah. Restore was an opportunity for faithful Latter Day Saints to spend a weekend restoring their faith with music, talks, community and more. It was attended by over 3500 people and had the look and feel of an Evangelical gathering according to those who were there to observe. Randy, Rebecca, and Landon discuss the significance of this type of conference that portrays a different type of Mormonism you won\u0027t find in the pews on Sunday. We talk about what this type of gathering might mean for the church as a whole and it\u0027s future going forward. This was a very interesting conversation that also touched on the \u0022Christianization\u0022 of Mormonism, something that seems to be unfolding very rapidly. Randy has great insights and perspectives that we were really fascinated to explore with him on this important episode.

      "description": "On a special Halloween episode of Mormonish Podcast, Rebecca and Landon delve into the world of Near Death Experiences, also known as NDEs. Near Death Experiences have taken center stage recently as we have learned more about the many people who claim to have had NDEs and those who have been influenced by them. Julie Row, Thom Harrison and the book, \u0022Visions of Glory,\u0022 Chad Daybell, the new Angel Studio movie, \u0022Near Death,\u0022 and more, are drawing a great deal of attention and we felt it was important to learn more. In the last few decades, the phenomenon of NDEs has been studied with increasing interest. We now know more than ever about the physiology of the brain and it\u0027s capabilities. When death is near, the brain has mechanisms in place that can influence all the senses, resulting in some incredible experiences. Mormonish Podcast shares our research as we look for the truth behind Near Death Experiences. Is it God? Is it your own brain? Is it something in between? You be the judge.

The donation was to be used to build a Family History Center in the museum. We recently learned that the Family History Center was never built and we put our sleuthing skills to the test as we try to find out more about the donation, it\u0027s purpose, why the Family History Center was not build, and what eventually happened to the $2M donation. We got many answers but also ended up with more questions. But it was a very interesting journey.

On Sunday, October 22nd, the Bangkok Thailand LDS temple is being dedicated and there is a long an complicated relationship with the LDS church and Thailand that few know about. Our guest on this episode has spent decades in Thailand, first as a missionary and then working and raising a family in the LDS church. His unique perspective sheds light on the tumultuous past and culture clash between an American church and Buddhist tradition. The LDS missionary incident of 1972 gained international attention and forever changed missionary work in Thailand. The LDS church learned valuable lessons in respecting culture and training outgoing missionaries to understand and work within the framework of other cultures worldwide. This is an event that we certainly knew nothing about and were absolutely fascinated to hear the story from our guest, who will remain anonymous for personal reasons. We appreciate him bringing this story to Mormonish Podcast so we can gain a greater understanding of the LDS church\u0027s history in Thailand.

Laura received her doctorate degree from Duke University and works in the public sector in Indiana, and is an affiliate researcher at Virginia Tech. Laura began looking into OUR because of the strong evangelical support for the organization, eventually researching and writing a series of very thought provoking articles. She eventually struck an unlikely friendship with Lynn Packer, who has been studying and reporting on OUR for years, and was able to share information back and forth with him in this interesting and productive collaboration. Speaking with Mormonish, Laura shares her unique perspective on recent events involving OUR and Tim Ballard from a point of view most of us haven\u0027t heard before. She also brings several important issues to light regarding international rescue operations that need to considered more fully. The big picture of OUR\u0027s international recue missions is something very complex. We learned quite a lot in our conversation with Laura and we\u0027re really excited to share this important episode with our Mormonish viewers and listeners. This will be part one of two.

On this episode of Mormonish Podcast, Rebecca and Landon explore the growing observation that Tim Ballard is a reincarnation of Joseph Smith himself. Many people can\u0027t help notice that several of the grooming and manipulation tactics that the female victims are alleging have a familiar ring to them. From using scripture to convince women to do things they wouldn\u0027t normally do, to claiming authorization from a higher power, to encouraging secrecy, there are seemingly many similarities and parallels.

Ben grew up on a Mormon polygamist compound and started operating his family\u2019s business, a bakery, at age 14. Ben gets serious as we discuss this darker aspect of growing up and provides some important and emotional insights. When Ben finally left polygamy he spent a decade building a successful online education company. Eventually he felt the call to pursue his dream to be a stand-up comic and has been performing his unique brand of comedy, drawing upon his experiences growing up, ever since. Fresh King Benjamin has a comedy set coming up this weekend, Friday and Saturday, October 13-14 at Wiseguys Comedy Club in SLC, UT. This is a hilarious, ADULT show, that Rebecca and Landon have attended before and had a wonderful time. We really enjoyed getting to know Ben better in this episode and there are some really great lessons to learn from our discussion.

Laura received her doctorate degree from Duke University and currently serves as the campus minister for Ferrum College in Virginia. Laura began looking into OUR because of the strong evangelical support for the organization, eventually researching and writing a series of very thought provoking articles. She eventually struck an unlikely friendship with Lynn Packer, who has been studying and reporting on OUR for years, and was able to share information back and forth with him in this interesting and productive collaboration. Speaking with Mormonish, Laura shares her unique perspective on recent events involving OUR and Tim Ballard from a point of view most of us haven\u0027t heard before. She also brings several important issues to light regarding international rescue operations that need to considered more fully. The big picture of OUR\u0027s international recue missions is something very complex. We learned quite a lot in our conversation with Laura and we\u0027re really excited to share this important episode with our Mormonish viewers and listeners. This will be part one of two.

Each person had to sign an NDA to even be in the room. The plan was outlined on a whiteboard, also known as a dry erase board, and revealed many surprising details that caused several participants in the room to part ways with Tiim Ballard at that point. Not only did it present a strategy to funnel funds from multiple non profits into Tim Ballard\u0027s for profit businesses, but it also outlined a plan to use the pubicity of the OUR rescue missions to convents as many people as possible to the LDS church.

James discusses how facilitators are chosen and rarely have any kind of experience or training. He tells us more about how the 12 Step Programs work and how people who are referred to these programs often slip deeper into shame and guilt. James has a very interesting story himself and it was fascinating to delve deeper into the world of LDS therapy programs in general. In light of the recent Jodi Hildebrandt revelations on abuses within the LDS therapy system, this topic is not only timely but very important and we thank James for being willing to share his story.

Lundwall recounts the testimony of Charles Anthon and compares the writing from the gold plates to magical seals from the Western esoteric tradition; textual density problems are soon resolved when one considers the magic worldview and how Joseph Smith imagined ancient writing systems. Dr. Lundwall ends the episode by comparing the Caractors Document with every known writing system and examines the iconographic features of the symbols to determine that the script has to be logo-syllabic, but then shows problematic issues with the symbols, especially in the proper names that are being represented by them.

      "description": "Have you read D. Michael Quinn\u0027s \u0022Early Mormonism and the Magic World View?\u0022 On this episode of Mormonish, Landon and Rebecca present a discussion of Quinn\u0027s ground breaking book on early Mormonism and folk magic. This was a revolutionary concept when the first edition of the book was published in 1987. Very few members knew anything about the prevalence of folk magic and the occult in the early days of the church and it\u0027s importance in the Smith household itself. This book is a must read to truly understand the origins of the church. If you haven\u0027t read the book and don\u0027t think you want to tackle it, this presentation and discussion offers a great synopsis of the important information in the book. This episode was taped as a spooky Halloween edition of The Good Book Club in October 2022, so don\u0027t be surprised by anything you see!

      "description": "On this episode of Mormonish, we sit down with our two new friends from a concerned citizen\u0027s group in Heber, UT, to find out more about their goal, to have the new LDS temple relocated to a more appropriate site. As you watch the episode, you certainly won\u0027t miss the parallels to the situation with the Cody, WY Temple. As background info, a new temple for Heber Valley, UT was announced at General Conference in October 2021. The site was revealed on September 19th, 2022 and a ground breaking ceremony with President Russell M. Nelson was held on October 8th, just a few weeks later. The temple will be 88,000 square feet with an elevation of 5,712.72 feet, by far the largest building anywhere in the area. Three times taller than the existing tabernacle in Heber, for comparison. While many of us were lamenting the effect a large temple would have on the dark skies in this untouched area, most assumed that after the groundbreaking the temple had begun construction. This is not the case and a very active and organized group of citizens in the Heber Valley area are working hard to find a better solution and have the temple relocated to a more suitable area. As Mormonish learned from a site visit with the citizen\u0027s group, there are big concerns about the present site including dark skies, water table issues, height issues, location in the flight path to a local airport, and more. We learned a lot from our visit to the Heber Valley proposed temple site and we know you will too. If you\u0027d like to learn more or help financially, here is their contact info.

If you watched the documentary like we did, the similarities were impossible to ignore. On this episode of Mormonish Podcast, Rebecca and Landon have a fascinating discussion with Lindsey Williams and Chad Harris, both survivors of the IBLP religious organization started by Bill Gothard. We highly recommend that you watch the documentary, \u0022Shiny, Happy People\u0022 on Amazon Prime to understand the full scope of this high demand, high control religious movement and what survivors went through. Both Lindsey and Chad appeared in the documentary to tell their story of survival and eventually thriving. Their humor and positive outlook is very inspiring and they are both just wonderful people. It was our pleasure to get to know them better on the episode and we plan to collaborate more in the future.

In recent years, this narrative has been turned on it\u0027s head. The church essay claims that these new details have always been available to members and we must have misunderstood the information we were given in the past.

As Dr. Simon Southerton tells us, one of the most closely guarded secrets of the Mormon church is the numbers of people sitting in Mormon chapels each week. Church leaders know what the attendance figures are, but the leaders don\u0027t like sharing bad news. The truth is that attendance is lower than everyone expects and is declining rapidly in most western countries. While the church won\u0027t share the numbers, our cellphones may hold the key to getting a more accurate picture of what the real attendance numbers are. Dr. Southerton dives into the use of cellphone technology and the information it can give us in this absolutely fascinating episode.

      "description": "In episode three of this series, Dr. John Knight Lundwall discusses his third thesis, \u201CThe text of the Book of Mormon cannot be derived from the description of the gold plates.\u201D Dr. Lundwall re-examines the claim that an ancient, one-thousand-year history was written on a stack of gold plates in an unknown language by looking at the gold plates themselves (as described by witnesses and others). While other critical analysis has been done on this subject, Lundwall reviews the debate and adds some insights of his own. Specifically, Dr. Lundwall reviews the most common artifacts used by apologists to show writing on metal plates in an ancient Near Eastern or American context, and then shows that every example they use are ritual texts belonging to a different thought-world that this series has highlighted. Instead of supporting the claims of the LDS Church, these examples continue to deconstruct the claims for historicity of the Book of Mormon text. Finally, Dr. Lundwall discusses the physical properties and measurements of the plates and contrasts that with an analysis of textual density of both ancient examples and modern re-creations. He ends this analysis with a discussion of the Book of Ether in the Book of Mormon text, which gives us a description of plates, content, and Joseph Smith\u2019s assumptions about textual density using ancient languages. Lundwall finishes this podcast with a discussion of several key assumptions Joseph Smith had when constructing the history and text of the Book of Mormon. These assumptions are embedded in the worldview of both the Book of Mormon and Mormonism, and are deeply problematic for claims to historicity and authenticity for the supposed sacred text. -- Donate -- We appreciate our Mormonish viewers and listeners so much!

      "description": "On another collaborative episode in The Gospel Topics Essays Series with The Backyard Professor, Rebecca and Landon dive into the Gospel Topics Essay, \u0022DNA and Book of Mormon Studies\u0022 with special guest, anthropologist Dr. Thomas Murphy. Mormons of a certain age all grew up knowing that the Book of Mormon was a record of the Nephites and Lamanites who were the \u0022principle\u0022 ancestors of the Native Americans today. In the last few decades, new DNA evidence has disputed this claim and caused the LDS church to make changes to this centuries old narrative. We are now told that the people of the Book of Mormon were \u0022among\u0022 the ancestors of Native Americans today. This very informative episode delves into DNA studies of indigenous populations, migration patterns, the church\u0027s ever changing narrative, and more. It was amazing to have this discussion with two scholars as knowledgeable as The Backyard Professor and Dr. Thomas Murphy.

      "description": "In Part 2 of Mormonish Podcast\u0027s ongoing series, Dr. John K. Lundwall expounds on his research discussed in Part 1, New Groundbreaking Research Dismantles Book of Mormon Authenticity: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u0026#61;xu6VV9Nfq3E Dr. Lundwall further probes the problems with Book of Mormon authenticity based on oral, secondary oral, and literary cultures in the pre\u2013Columbian Americas. He also responds to comments and questions regarding the first installment of this series. As we dive deeper into these concepts, Dr. Lundwall discusses how monotheism developed through multiple threads of history. While writing-systems form a cultural and intellectual framework of thought in which new religious ideas may grow, social and political contexts also play an equal role in the development of monotheism. We also learn more about religious practices based on ritual and sacred place and the transition between temple theology versus individual, internalized worship, which was the common world view in the 19th century but did not exist in the Book of Mormon era. The evolution of ritual and cosmological religion rooted in agriculture to a textualized religion rooted in laws, doctrines, and sermons, for example, the Torah, didn\u0027t actually occur until centuries after the Nephites left Jerusalem. One of the more surprising discussion points Dr. Lundwall brings up involves the actual worship practices that existed in the pre Columbian Americas. Yes, we\u0027re going to talk about human sacrifice and headhunting. This episode is scholarly in nature, but we encourage everyone to take a good look at this research and data. It\u0027s fascinating. Dr. Lundwall will address the further points of his thesis, a) one cannot obtain the text of the Book of Mormon from the description of the gold plates, b) the characters copied by the scribes and witnesses purportedly from the gold plates are fabricated and can be falsified, and c) the standard of proof for the Book of Mormon resides only in a tight translation, in upcoming episodes.

Sam shares his story as he fought to implement changes to stop in appropriate bishop interviews with youth church wide over the last decade.

On this episode of Mormonish Podcast, we dive into ethics and morality with our special guest, Widow\u2019s Mite spokesperson, Professor Spencer Anderson. Spencer has recently appeared in the last of a three part Mormon Stories series on church finance and will soon appear on Mormonism Live to drop another financial bombshell from the Widow\u2019s Mite. There are many ethical and moral questions they arise in these discussions about church finance and Rebecca and Landon take it to a broader level with Professor Spencer to discuss the whole spectrum of morality in society and individual ethics. We delve into this question by basing our discussion on one of Professor Spencer\u2018s favorite books, \u201CHow to Be Perfect: The Correct Answer to Every Moral Question\u201D by Michael Schur, creator of \u201CThe Good Place.\u201D We just loved all the insights Professor Spencer shared!

His extensive scholarly work proves that it\u0027s impossible for a book with the literary complexity of the Book of Mormon to have even existed anywhere in the Americas during the Book of Mormon era. We consider this research to be incontrovertible evidence that the Book of Mormon is not a historical record. This episode is scholarly in nature and Dr. Lundwall does an amazing job of giving us a graduate-level course in just a few hours. Once you understand the concepts of oral versus literary societies, the conclusions will be obvious and the evidence clear. This is absolutely groundbreaking, and we believe is a completely new way to examine the historicity of the Book of Mormon. We appreciate our Mormonish viewers and listeners so much!

      "description": "Did Joseph Smith record D\u0026C 132, the revelation on plural marriage? A growing number of members of the church and splinter groups believe that Joseph Smith did not practice polygamy, but rather, this practice was instituted by Brigham Young. They also believe that any written record of Joseph\u0027s polygamy, including D\u0026C 132 was created years later by Brigham Young to make it appear that Joseph Smith practiced polygamy. Radio Free Mormon joins Mormonish on this explosive episode to provide incontrovertible evidence that D\u0026C 132 was recorded in Joseph Smith\u0027s life time, and was seen and reviewed by several different people who printed affidavits in the Nauvoo Expositor. This comparison between their description of D\u0026C 132, as stated in the affidavits, and D\u0026C 132 itself makes it perfectly clear that this document must have existed during Joseph Smith\u0027s lifetime.

Most of us grew up in the church with the narrative that we would someday become gods and create our own worlds. This was not something we misunderstood, but something that was taught in sunday school lessons, seminary, sacrament meeting talks, firesides, and more. In the past decades and especially recently, this idea has been discarded and sent down the memory hole as if it never existed. In this episode we delve into statements by past and current prophets that help us understand the motivations behind removing this pivitoal concept from the gospel. We also look at what this means to current members and what their concept of an afterlife looks like now. We know you\u0027ll find this episode as fascinating as we did, this change is gigantic! We also want to note that BYP had some technical issues in this episode but they even out as we get going, so bear with us, you\u0027ll be glad you did!

We discuss the sacred, not secret nature of Mother in Heaven, where we first hear mention of her, and what her role is. The idea of Mother in Heaven is gaining popularity and leaving both members and post Mormons wanting to know more. What is not said in the essay may be more important than what is said, which is very little. We found it fascinating to dive into this nebulous and little explored topic and we\u0027re sure you will too. We appreciate our Mormonish viewers and listeners so much!

      "description": "On this episode of Mormonish Podcast, Rebecca and Landon have a wonderful conversation with former law professor and play-wright Debora Threedy. Prior to becoming a law professor at the Univesity of Utah, Debora graduated and worked in theater. During her time in Utah, Debora delved into the hisotry of the region and stories from the past. The events at the Mountain Meadows Massacure on September 11, 1857 made a great impact on her. When she moved to the Mountain Meadows area of Utah she became even more immersed in the history and learned more about Juanita Brooks, a faithful member of the LDS church who was determined to tell the story of that dark chapter in LDS church history. Debora eventually wrote a play delving into the memories of the event itself, the generational impact it continues to have on families, and Juanita Brook\u0027s struggle to tell the true story. This wonderful play titled, \u0022Mountain Meadows\u0022 was performed in Salt Lake at the beginning of 2023 to sold out audiences. We are very pleased to announce that there is another opportunity to see this absolutely wonderful production again. On Saturday, July 15th at 7:00 pm MT, the Entrata Institute in Torry, Utah will be presenting a readers theater with the original actors from the SLC production. You can reserve free tickets by going to www.entradainstitute.org. Most of our viewer won\u0027t be able to attend this event but we are even more excited to announce that the production will be live streamed on Facebook on Saturday, July 15th at 7:00 pm MT so everyone can access it. Find the Entrada Institute on Facebook and you\u0027ll be able to join the event. I can\u0027t recomment this play more! We appreciate our Mormonish viewers and listeners so much!

The cost of the dinner is $250 a plate and it\u0027s sponsored by Scripture Central (formerly Book of Mormon Central.) Many people questioned the implication of the invitation and took to social media to discuss it. Is this a fundraiser that an apostle is speaking at? Mormonish cohosts Rebecca and Landon dive into the question as they research past Scripture Central fundraising events, changes in the online invitation during their investigation, the mission of Scripture Central and their use of donations, the relationship between Scripture Central and the LDS church, and more.

On this fascinating episode of Mormonish, cohosts Rebecca and Landon sit down with former bishop and stake presidency member, Ian Wilks and faithful apologist, Jim Bennett, to discuss their unlikely collaboration and new podcast \u201CInside Out.\u201D Ian grew up in a coal mining town in Wales and his story of living on the streets and finding the church is just incredible, as is his eventual journey out of the faith. You really have to hear the story to believe it! Jim was raised in the church and is a practicing member today, including singing in the Tabernacle Choir. Jim and Ian met on their mission to Scotland and formed a strong bond that continues today. Their new podcast looks at the church from the point of view of someone on the \u201Cinside\u201D and someone on the \u201Coutside.\u201D They both care deeply about the important issues facing members and post Mormons today, and are committed to finding common ground across difference divides.

All of us are familiar with the epic revelation, but many don\u0027t realize there were decades of behind the scenes politics, infighting and lobbying by the Q15 at play before the Priesthood Ban was finally lifted. Many of the Q15 were vehemently opposed to the \u201Crevelation,\u201D while others saw that it was the only way forward for the church and the behind the scenes story shines a light on the church, the politics, and the men themselves.

The presentation, titled, \u0022Teaching and Communicating the Doctrine of the Family to the Rising Generation\u0022 was given by presenter, Carol Rice, and included a story about a trans young adult who received a patriarchal blessing which changed this individual\u0027s identity to be more in line with an \u0022eternal self.\u0022 We had some pretty strong feelings about this story and thought a discussion was definitely warranted. We\u0027d love to know what our viewers and listeners thought of the story, we truly value your perspectives and insights.

      "description": "On a special financial update episode of Mormonish Podcast, Rebecca and Landon are joined by Canadian tithing whistleblower, Nigel Kennett. In his profession as an accountant, Nigel stumbled upon the fact that the LDS church was sending $100,000,000 or more to BYU-Provo, BYU-Idaho, and BYU-Hawaii annually. After asking local leaders for clarification, he eventually took the information to a Canadian news program, The 5th Estate, which broadcasted an episode on LDS tithing in Canada. Nigel tell us about his life as a faithful member up until his discovery, which put him on a path that changed his life and shone a spotlight on LDS church finances for the world to see. We absolutey loved our conversation with Nigel and we know you will too. He\u0027s a wonderful, caring, ethical human being who had to speak out when he recognized something that while legal, is not ethical or moral.

      "description": "Should the IRS investigate the LDS Church\u0027s wealth? On this episode of Mormonish, cohosts Rebecca and Landon dissect the recent statement made by Ensign Peak whistleblower, David Nielsen\u0027s lawyer, Michael Sullivan, in response to the 60 Minutes Episode. This statement clearly outlines the position both whistleblower David Nielsen and his lawyer take regarding the claims the church made on 60 Minutes and the puts forward the reasons the IRS needs to proceed with an investigation. We also reference a recent Salt Lake Tribune article on the same topic, \u0022Pressure builds to investigate LDS Church wealth\u0022 by Tony Semerad, which discusses the lawyer\u0027s belief that the government needs to do it\u0027s duty and launch an investigation. We found that the lawyer\u0027s statement clarified several things many of us had questions about and brought to light other aspects of the controversy. Let us know what you think, does the IRS need to follow through on an investigation of the LDS Church and its wealth?

At odds with the brethren over the church\u2019s interference with the election, he was suspended from ecclesiastical office and eventually forced to sign The Political Manifesto of 1895 or face excommunication. Mormonish Podcast cohosts Rebecca and Landon are joined again by church history buff, Master Peace (Ron Yorgason), as we delve deeper into the ongoing conflict between church and state as Utah struggled to gain statehood.

On this episode of Mormonish, Rebecca and Landon discuss the recent 60 Minutes segment featuring former Ensign Peak employee and whistleblower, David Neilsen\u0027s first ever on camer interview. We take a deep dive into the church\u0027s response to the accusation of misuse of funds, and dissect statements made by Bishop W. Chrisopher Wallen, who represented the LDS church in the segment. We also take an indepth look at response articles, podcasts, and the church\u0027s own statement following the interview. We especially pay attention to an article that came out on an apologist wevsite before the 60 Minutes interview even aired. Both Rebecca and Landon weigh in on the positive and negative take aways from the interview and talk about what a more positive future would look like in terms of church transparency and use of funds for charitable giving. We tried to keep our frustration to a minimum on air, but admit it was difficult.

Once he returned from his mission, he became a world traveler and adventurer which led to probably the most pivital experience of his life, being kidnapped and held against his will in Colombia in the late 1990s.

We first met Dr. Ray when our post Mormon virtual reading group, The Good Book Club, read Dr. Ray\u2019s mind blowing book \u201CSex and God: How Religion Distorts Sexuality\u201D and had him talk to the group. We are so excited to invite him back again, this time on Mormonish Podcast, to tell us more about high demand and high control religion and its negative effect on healthy developing sexuality. Dr. Ray discusses how natural sexual development can be warped in a highly religious environment, and then offers healing strategies going forward. This is an episode you won\u2019t want to miss!

      "description": "In this episode, Mormonish Podcast cohosts Rebecca and Landon visit with Nathan Smith of \u0022Mind Makes This World Podcast.\u0022 Nathan is an absolutely wonderful and unique individual! As a teenager he was actually an apologist for Fair Mormon and helped provide answers to many people who were struggling with their faith. During that time he went through his own faith transition, yet still decided to serve an LDS mission. While on his mission, he had many life-changing experiences that resulted in PTSD and some pretty serious trauma. Finding his way back from that led Nathan to explore eastern spiritual practices and the healing art of meditation. Nathan eventually started his ownn podcast, \u0022Mind Makes This World Podcast\u0022 where he explores all of these practices and concepts. Join us as we learn more about Nathan\u0027s remarkable journey of healing and self discovery! Nathan\u0027s Podcast: https://www.youtube.com/@mindmakesthisworld/videos",

The book explores innovative treatments from neuro-feedback and meditation to sports, drama and yoga that offer new paths to recovery by activating the brain\u0027s natural healing powers.
