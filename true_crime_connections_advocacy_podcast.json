      "description": "What if the person you trusted as a spiritual guide turned out to be the reason you lost yourself? In this gripping episode, Andrew-Ryan Profaci shares his harrowing experience inside the \u0027Love Has Won\u0027 cult, where he lived as \u0027Father God\u0027 under the control of Amy Carlson, known as \u0027Mother God.\u0027 \n\nFrom overcoming addiction and surviving stage four cancer to being manipulated and ultimately realizing the harsh truth, Andrew\u0027s story is a powerful testament to the struggle of reclaiming one\u0027s identity and finding real faith. This isn\u0027t just about escaping a cult; it\u0027s about discovering your true self and overcoming manipulation. Don\u0027t miss Andrew\u0027s emotional and unfiltered tale of survival and self-discovery.\n\nHow to Connect:\nhttps://thewaronlove.com/\n\nPhoto credit: YouTube\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTrue Crime Connections | Advocacy Podcast\nA survivor-led platform where stories of abuse, trauma, and resilience are shared openly.
