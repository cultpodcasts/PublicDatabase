I\u0027ve always gotten along with Bill Clinton. I\u0027ve been nice to him.  He\u0027s been nice to me.  We\u0027ve always gotten along.   I respect him.  I hate to see photos come out of him,\u201D Trump said.\n \nThe president added \u201CA lot of people are very angry that pictures are being released of other people that really had nothing to do with Epstein, but they\u0027re in a picture with him because he was at a party. And you ruin the reputation of somebody, so a lot of people are very angry that this continues.\u201D\n \nTrump said the Democrats are using the Epstein files as a way to deflect from all the success of the Republican Party and that he thought all the documents had already been released.\n\nFor more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca\n\nSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDc\nLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQ\nFollow Global News on X HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt\nFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB\n#GlobalNews",
