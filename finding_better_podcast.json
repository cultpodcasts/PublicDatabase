      "description": "\uD83C\uDF99\uFE0F From a controlling childhood in a religious cult, to two combat tours in Iraq, to calling the shots as a live TV director \u2014 Logan\u2019s story is one of survival, radical responsibility, and reinvention.

The ways PTSD and hypervigilance followed him home, and how those effects show up in daily life.\n4. The turning point: the thought that saved him and led to sobriety and radical action.\n5. How Logan cold-called his way into TV directing \u2014 and why pursuing a dream is part of healing.\n6. What \u201Cradical responsibility\u201D really means and practical steps listeners can use to take control.\n7.
