      "description": "Last September I made a podcast called \u0022why I left my spiritual community.\u0022 After I shared it, the leader told me that I would be hearing from her lawyer if I did not take the podcast down. Now I have realized that I was in what I believe to be a spiritual cult. I also have realized, after receiving a cease \u0026 desist letter because of my recent Instagram posts, that I never did anything wrong by making my initial podcast. So in this episode, I tell you what\u0027s happening now with my journey, and I also put that episode I made last fall, back up so you can listen to the whole thing.
