      "title": "The Secretive Cult That Spread Through Small-Town Australia",
      "description": "In 1982, Ken Dyers and Jan Hamilton founded a group called Kenja Communication. On the surface, it looked like a self-help program built on \u201Cenergy release\u201D and \u201Cpersonal communication.\u201D But behind the closed doors of community halls in places like Wagga Wagga and Albury, many say it was something far darker.\n\nWas Kenja simply an eccentric training program misunderstood by the media, or was it truly a destructive cult hiding in plain sight? Families say they watched loved ones change forever. Supporters insist it was unfairly targeted.\n\nJoin me as we uncover one of Australia\u2019s strangest small-town stories \u2014 a tale of secrecy, control, and the vulnerability of communities searching for meaning.",
