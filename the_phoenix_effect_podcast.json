Ryan shares his journey from the initial allure and enticement of the cult, to the traumatic realization of its oppressive and isolating control tactics. The episode explores his transformation from a manipulated teenager subjected to spiritual abuse and isolation, to a self-aware adult dedicated to healing through storytelling and podcasting. Along the way, Ryan reflects on the importance of truth-telling, active listening, and reclaiming one\u0027s identity and faith in the aftermath of such experiences. Tune in for an in-depth discussion on the impact of religious trauma and the power of resilience and human spirit.\n\n00:00 Introduction to the Phoenix Effect Podcast\n00:33 Meet Ryan: A Journey of Healing\n01:04 The Truth That Heals: Ryan\u0027s Story\n01:49 Life in the Cult: Manipulation and Control\n05:50 Breaking Free: The Path to Healing\n12:17 The Allure of the Cult: Vulnerability and Faith\n17:08 The Moment of Doubt: Realizing the Truth\n20:32 Family Ties: The Struggle to Leave\n21:45 Manipulation and Guilt\n23:34 Isolation and Control\n25:42 Confronting Abuse\n28:26 Escape and New Challenges\n30:48 Finding Belonging\n34:19 Podcasting for Healing\n38:27 Conclusion and Final Thoughts\n\n#religoustrauma #spiritualabuse #cult #truththatheals #healing #podcast #narrativestory #truth #cult\n\nTo learn more about elle visit:\nhttps://courageousstepscounseling.com\n\nTo lean more about kristin visit:\nhttps://www.kristinboscaljon.com",
