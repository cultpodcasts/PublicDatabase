      "description": "T Matthew Brown was raised in a secular, supportive household that valued intellect. He was out as gay from when he was 12. So how did he end up in a Sufi cult, with his named change, and married to a woman. It\u0027s not a wild story. Its indoctrination and inculturation by degrees. But its such an interesting story. Tee is bringing his performance art piece to Melbourne from the 30th of September to the 5th Octover, 5:30pm every night at Spielhaus in Melbourne.

      "description": "Today\u0027s episode is a special one. When my friend and co-runner of the Victorian Cult Survivors Network told me she had finally found the courage to tell her story in its full and raw form, I shot my hand up to host it here with the Unchurchables. Renee lost her daughter to the Kidney Cult (also known as the Jesus Christians). Somewhere, her daughter still exists. She is still loved and missed, but mother and daughter are on opposite sides of the ocean, and of an idealogical divide brokered by a cruel cult leader - one who Renee successfully sued for defamation and won. Todays episode is a heartbreaking tale with all of the trigger warnings. But I hope it serves as a reminder that the damage of cults isn\u0027t limlited to the one on the inside. Estranged parents and family of those radicalised into coercive cults are part of that damage too, and their stories matter greatly. Go kindly as you listen. Thank you Renee for finding your voice, and fighting for reform. One day, I hope to celebrate with you as your daughter finds her way back to you.

      "description": "This episode comes with a content warning: we are discussing heavy themes including coerced marriage and modern slavery. Please look after yourself as you read. This is an important episode. Art Sherwood, host of the DisAllusioned podcast, joins me to talk about how she applied for a job as a massage therapist and got radicalised into a philosophy cult that later coerced her into marrying the cult leader. He was blind, riddled with physical health issues, and 37 years her senior. Ari did not fit any of the \u0027normal\u0027 risk factors for joining a cult. She was just looking for a job. Her parents did everything right to keep contact with her. Still, this happened. As the Victorian Government undertakes an inquiry into cults and fringe groups, stories like this matter. Not all cults are religious. Not all cult recruits fit the same profile. Listen well. THIS is the harm we have to stop",

Academic Jon Sawyer joins me as we talk about some juicy, heavy hitting topics - conspiratorial demonology, weaponisation of testimony culture, self-invisible LGBT Christians, sexual orientation and gender identity change efforts, load language inside Evangelicalism, white supremacy and indoctrination techniques used in Christian Nationalism. I mean...that about covers whats wrong in the world, doesn\u0027t it? You really should look at the rest of Jon\u0027s work at https://www.jonsawyer.org/ and of course his contribution to Dr Lucas Wilsons, book \u0022Shame Sex Attraction.\u0022 (Find it here https://amzn.asia/d/5Et3wfT ) Its a vital time in history to be informed, especially if you are in a Westernised nation where the backlash against progress, and the decrying of \u0022Wokeism\u0022 (ie. Empathy and respect for others) threatens a Christian Nationalist uprising masked as resurging religiopolitial conservatism. This episode, Blake Chastains episode (and book), and Lukes episode (and book) need to be top of your to-listen lists. And I\u0027m not often demanding like that.",

I guess it was too close to home. But its time. We need to move from representation to meaningful change, and that means understanding on a deep and nuanced level that sexual orientation and gender identity change efforts aren\u0027t always what you think they are.

In it, I chat to Blake Chastain, who launched the Exvangelical Podcast back in 2016 as he talks about his new book \u0022Exvangelical and Beyond: How American Christianity Went Radical and the Movement That\u0027s Fighting Back.\u0022 We have long known that, where America goes religiously and politically, the western world tends to follow. In line with this, strains of Christian Nationalism, even white Christian nationalism, and other forms of fringe and extreme right-wing politics has spiked both here and overseas. Its one to pay attention to. Make sure you give it a listen.

      "description": "In this months episode, the lovely, courageous, intelligent Ronna Detrick joins me to talk about her newly-released book \u0022Rewriting Eve.\u0022 It started from a simple place: in seminary, when the guys translated a passage of scripture, it came out vastly different to how the women\u0027s translations came out. The subjects and verbs were correct. But the nuance, the subtext, the angle - all vastly different. And so Ronna set about rewriting Eve (and other Biblical women). The result is powerful insight into what happens when we let women tell their own stories. I\u0027ll admit this one hit heavy for me. After all, I am a woman who is only just learning to write her own story. I suspect many Exvangelical women may feel the same. We\u0027ve been called crazy, headstrong, unstable, divisive, emotional, Jezebelic and all sorts. But maybe that was patriarchy writing our stories for us. Find out more about Ronna on Insta, FB or here https://ronnadetrick.com And enjoy the episode",

I\u0027m not sure why I\u0027m surprised, when evangelicalism itself is a very whitewashed sort of reality. This episode talks about how totalitarianism, conspiracy theories and cults are built on a very similar, very toxic sort of foundation.

It\u0027s a strange muscle to have to learn to flex when you\u0027ve been told that emotions like anger, assertiveness or blunt honesty are not feminine or acceptable. Guess what! They are both! In this chat, we talk about boundaries, rage humour, feminism, and life in general - and I confess I laughed entirely too much in this episode because I was perhaps a bit excited to be back, and perhaps a bit nervous to be in the interviewers chair after so long out of it! This conversation is as much about finding your resolve and your supportive community as it is finding your voice and your right to exist in the unique space you want to, rather than the role you were cast in but never wanted.

To this end, this episode has been positively medicinal for me, as Reverend Doctor Beverley Dale takes us inside the Bible and shows us that the Bible has been shown to us in a way that sanitises it, but pleasure, sexuality and sensuality are there in black (and red) and white. Certainly not contraband like so many of us have been taught.",

But can I point something out? Deconstruction is hard work. And it\u0027s not even like you get to choose whether or not to deconstruct. It seems to choose you! So finding the humour in the journey is vital to maintaining your place on the happy wagon while you also deal with grief, existential questions and all the overthinking that comes with deconstructing faith or making your way towards something like a new lens through which to view life, the universe and other things. A friend of mine once told me that \u0022the humour is part of the healing.\u0022 And I\u0027m 100% there with her on that. When I found Angry Church Kid on the gram, I loved her humour. Now that I\u0027ve interviewed her, I love her fearlessness, her irreverence and her understanding of what it is to deconstruct out of church but not land quite at atheism.

      "description": "In Sunday school, kids learn about the golden calf - the moment the Hebrews banded behind Moses\u0027 brother Aaron and made a god of their own to worship while their leader was up on the mountain. It was the perhaps the first time in recorded history, but certainly not the last time that we would make a god in our own image. Today, in Evangelical churches across the world, we cherry pick and reinterpret scripture to make Jesus fit our needs. These incarnations, according to Marc-Henri Sandoz Paradella, are the Toxic Jesus\u0027s we need to remove from our lives if we are going to move from \u0022holy shit\u0022 to spiritual healing. I loved this interview and the humble wisdom of the man who wrote the book. Enjoy!",

It\u0027s important for a number of reasons. 2020 saw many things revealed; political upheaval, church abuse scandals, continued scandals in Hollywood as a result of the Me Too movement, the pandemic which saw many of us face escalations in our personal lives or our mental health. In line with this, it is not only unhelpful but it should be unacceptable for churches to sweep such things under the rug with thought-terminating cliches like \u0022just forgive\u0022 or \u0022have faith in God and don\u0027t be bitter.\u0022 We need to be trauma informed. And we need people like Jess who can walk us through how to do better. Enjoy this session!",

Their\u0027s is a relationship that started as high school sweethearts, and travelled through churchianity, deconstruction, and one partner coming out as transgender.

A proud woman of colour, daughter of immigrants, clinical psychologist and general badass, she is the pioneer behind the \u0022Race Positive\u0022 program which aims to bring a strengths-based approach to a topic often loaded with deficit language. In life post BLM, its important to keep talking about systemic racism until we can dismantle it! But the reason I found her was another topic altogether, when a listener asked me how I handle my PTSD. It wasn\u0027t something I\u0027ve talked about much, but perhaps I should. Because normalising trauma responses and their treatment matters. And so do you! Thanks for tuning in.",

      "description": "A chat with Kevin Garcia is always insightful, fun, challenging (in a good way) and a bit mind-bending. This session is no different. The original intent was to have Kevin stop by and talk about their new book \u0022Bad Theology Kills\u0022 - and perhaps there is no better time in history to have this book-baby out there in the world. But in true Kevin style, we couldn\u0027t help but extend the conversion far beyond that - deconstruction, spellcraft, sex, sexuality, civil rights revolutions and the power of red lipstick. Curious? Give it a listen.",
