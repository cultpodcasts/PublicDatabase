We couldn\u0027t resist diving back into The Deep End for another episode of Serving Cult. This time, we\u0027re continuing to unravel the chaotic universe of Teal Swan\u2014spiritual guru aka raging narcissist. Teal is furious about her haters and thinks they\u2019re the ones stopping her from making more money and not her awful bedside manner. With ambitions to build the biggest company ever, she\u0027s got a crazy-eyed determination that\u0027s equally terrifying and somewhat impressive. From manipulating retreat attendees to hiring a tennis coach, Teal uses her sociopathic tendencies with Patrick Bateman-like precision to reel in followers.

In my response, I break down some journaling techniques to help you get started and even share a special one I haven\u2019t shared before. Listen in to find out! And in part 2, We find out that Taylor has joined a cult\u2026well she\u2019s the leader, and Trent and I are thinking about joining?? No, we are working on getting her out, I promise!

      "description": "In this episode I give an update about how I\u2019m doing as I experience post-event collapse syndrome due to moving house and state. I explain the coping mechanism I use in times where I have limited emotional and physical capacity, and have to let some responsibilities slide. I tease out a comforting concept, that while people might care about our dropped responsibilities, no one will remember the incident within a year. I also make a case for Imperfection Practice, which is showing up and doing things with the capacity available, rather than waiting for when one can achieve perfectly. I then answer a listener question about how to make big life decisions in general when stuck in paralysis because of it. I explain that indecision is still decision and its often the inner saboteur\u2019s doing. I walk the listener through the exercise of creating environments that lead to conducive behaviours and decisions. \u00A0 You can email in your written question, or send in a recorded MP3 voicenote to be inserted into the podcast via hello@advancedbitches.com.

      "description": "In today\u2019s episode I answer two listener questions. The first one is about how to engage with bigoted family. My short answer is that\u2026you don\u2019t! I explain that engaging is a losing game, because they remain unconvinced and you remain frustrated. I share that in moments like these I like to reach into my toolbox of strategies and coping mechanisms, and offer some to them. I explain that if you have to be in the same space as a bigot, use scripts which are predetermined answers to questions and situations you will find uncomfortable as may help you feel prepared and safe. I also recommend \u201CC Jade Run\u201D, an acronym that outlines what co-dependents should avoid doing: Convincing people, Justifying themselves, Arguing, Defending and Explaining. Finally, I encourage the listener to leave spaces that make them uneasy; either physically by leaving a room, or mentally checking out by going on their phone. The second question is from a listener who asks why they can\u2019t get better. I discuss this in detail, assuring them that the work isn\u2019t staying on the path but about getting back on it when we veer off. I elaborate on what this looks like through a personal anecdote about how my therapist guided me through this same feeling \u00A0 You can email in your written question, or send in a recorded MP3 voicenote to be inserted into the podcast via hello@advancedbitches.com.

      "description": "Today\u2019s episode is all about your trauma related questions! The first listener asks how much of our trauma do we share with our children once they become adults? I tackle this question in two parts, firstly how to approach discussing trauma with children when they\u2019re young, and then with our children once they\u2019re adults. I discuss how I approached telling my children I would be checking into to rehab, and how I navigated not wanting to lie while also not burdening them with details they wouldn\u2019t be able to process. I encourage the listener to talk to their kids about their trauma how they\u2019d talk to their kids about any difficult subject: with clarity and awareness of which details are unnecessarily scary. The second listener question is about how to deal with the voice that tells them they will fail after every ounce of success they achieve. I contextualize this fear of \u201Cthe other shoe dropping\u201D as very normal for folks who have CPTSD. Many of us don\u2019t want to feel hope because we\u2019ve had it crushed before, and so it is a natural defence mechanism. I detail the science behind why we think this way, and reference a study linked below. I offer some reassurance to help them reframe this feeling, to feel this feeling and to push past it anyway. \u00A0 You can email in your written question, or send in a recorded MP3 voicenote to be inserted into the podcast via hello@advancedbitches.com \u00A0 LINKS \u00A0 The Advanced Bitchifesto - https://www.advancedbitches.com/the-bitchifesto Advanced Bitches Bingo - https://www.advancedbitches.com/bingo-instructions Homeostasis, Stress, Trauma, and Adaptation A Neurodevelopmental View of Childhood Trauma by Bruce D.

      "description": "Today\u2019s episode is packed with your listener questions! From co-dependency, to comparison and divorce. In Part 1 I answer a listener question about what to do about a man she\u2019s dating who is \u2018hot and cold\u2019, and generally inconsistent. I explain that first and foremost, in order to heal from co-dependency we must develop a keen eye for identifying relationship dynamics. I explain that the one he is exhibiting is the \u201Cbait and switch\u201D and that she ultimately needs to create a standard for behaviour she tolerates and then move towards what she appreciates and away from what is distressing. I also recommend she revisit the Ladder of Trust. In Part 2 I describe a tool previously touched upon, called The Comparison Tool. I add more detail to it, describing how I avoid the natural but brutal act of comparison. I explain that inheriting people\u2019s well fortune also means inheriting their woes, and that ultimately, it is safer to deal with the devil you know \u2013 ie. your own circumstances. In Part 3 a listener writes in to express her devastation that after her husband divorced her, he and his family seem happier than ever. I caution that social media is far from an accurate depiction of how\u00A0 people are truly doing; pictures are a curated snapshot of what people want you to see. I also advise that dysfunctional dynamics follow people, so if her husband was not doing his self-development work with her, he won\u2019t have suddenly become more enlightened with someone else. \u00A0 You can submit your question by text or mp3 voicenote to be played on the podcast via hello@advancedbitches.com \u00A0 LINKS \u00A0 The Advanced Bitchifesto - https://www.advancedbitches.com/the-bitchifesto Advanced Bitches Bingo - https://www.advancedbitches.com/bingo-instructions \u00A0 Keep up with me: https://www.instagram.com/advancedbitches/ https://www.advancedbitches.com/membership https://www.tiktok.com/@advancedbitches https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCND6RMWO-erRUYMXVOAynWQ \u00A0 My books: \u00A0 The Irreverent Grief Guide:\u00A0 How to F*cking Survive Months 1-3 https://amzn.to/3sZYalY The Irreverent Trust Guide:\u00A0 How to Trust Again after Past Trauma F*cked You Up \u00A0https://amzn.to/3JJbIKA \u00A0 Produced by Wowow",

      "description": "In Part 1 I answer a listener question about whether she can do my self-development programme while remaining in communication with a friend she has co-dependent and sometimes abusive dynamics with. She loves her friend dearly and is also afraid of being alone and without said friends\u2019 love. I firstly establish that she is in control of her healing, and gets to decide who stays and who goes; there are no mandatory requirements. I warn her that it is easy to fall into old patterns with people we formed bonds with when we were young, and that this is something to be mindful of. In light of this, I give her two tools she can use to ensure she honours her self development while maintaining her friendship. \u00A0The first tool is for self-reflection, to help her understand what her friendship might reflect about herself, and to allow her to release judgement of herself and her friend. The second tool is about how to get off the cycle of abuse, which is also on my YouTube channel linked below. I assure her that as she keeps working on herself and her boundaries, the friendship will either withstand the changes or naturally fall away, both which she will be equipped to deal with because of the inner work she is doing.

      "description": "In Part 1 I answer a listener question about how to deal with someone in their running club who makes derogatory remarks about their body that inadvertently trigger the listener. I explain that we need to separate the question into its two parts: concern for the person making the remarks, and addressing how the listener is triggered by them. I firstly encourage the listener to consider whether adults need ever tell other adults how to feel and act. I explain that correcting adults in this way may highlight an underlying assumption that our behaviours and beliefs are superior to theirs. I suggest that the listener can lift up the person with compliments and assurance, or even use the nonviolent communication method to clearly illustrate the impact of the person\u2019s remarks. For more on this communication method, check out Episode , for more on that check out Episode 13. I advise the listener to prepare for the person\u2019s reaction, which could be that she resents them for this feedback. I then advise the listener on the second part of her question, which is how to deal with what triggers us. I advise setting a boundary or simply physically distancing from this person during their running club.

I summarize that shitty things happen to all of us, but come in different flavours, and your flavour is unfortunately this hurricane. I explain that the best you can do is to have grace with yourself, understand that of course your executive function will drop, and to give yourself time and space to process, grieve and feel whatever comes up.

During the first half I explain how beneficial I find it to observe cults. I discuss how cults can be a mirror for our interpersonal relationships, and how empathizing with their victims helps us examine our own trauma responses. I also detail how engaging in cult material can help us be more aware and alert of cultish dynamics in the mundane and everyday. In Part 2, the first listener asks if their post-breakup expectations were unrealistic, and the second listener asks how to stay friends with people not doing inner work. In both scenarios I detail the ladder of trust as an appropriate tool to create intimacy and mutual investment. \u00A0 To submit a question, you can email it or send a voice recording of your question to be played on the podcast to hello@advancedbitches.com \u00A0 LINKS \u00A0 The Advanced Bitchifesto - https://www.advancedbitches.com/the-bitchifesto Advanced Bitches Bingo - https://www.advancedbitches.com/bingo-instructions Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving by Pete Walker https://amzn.to/3RLCkxm \u00A0 Keep up with me: https://www.instagram.com/advancedbitches/ https://www.advancedbitches.com/membership https://www.tiktok.com/@advancedbitches https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCND6RMWO-erRUYMXVOAynWQ \u00A0 My books: \u00A0 The Irreverent Grief Guide:\u00A0 How to F*cking Survive Months 1-3 https://amzn.to/3sZYalY The Irreverent Trust Guide:\u00A0 How to Trust Again after Past Trauma F*cked You Up \u00A0https://amzn.to/3JJbIKA \u00A0 Produced by Wowow",

      "description": "In part 1 answer a listener question about how to approach confronting a Fight Mode person about their upsetting behavior. I first detail why assessing other people\u0027s trauma responses in times of crisis is not conducive in achieving the desired outcome of mutual understanding, respect and boundaries. Diagnosing people can have the unintended effect of creating hierarchies and power dynamics in our heads that don\u2019t aid conflict resolution. I then recommend the highly effective tool of Nonviolent Communication coined by Marshall Rosenberg. This framework advocates for a formulaic approach to confrontation that distinguishes fact from emotion in order to facilitate resolution.

I explain that this is typical Fawn and Freeze Behaviour and contextualize what this behaviour looks like in different scenarios. I offer her comfort and practical tools to ensure better outcomes. I illustrate the power of bringing \u2018advocates\u2019 with her to services she knows she struggles vocalizing her needs. I recommend bookending experiences with check ins with an accountability partner so that she doesn\u2019t end up agreeing to prices or services she didn\u2019t want. And finally I discuss the importance of allowing people to experience the consequences of their actions instead of subsuming them herself. I encourage her to be free of self-judgement, and rather to observe and accept the resulting consequences of her Fawn and Freeze Behaviours, in a way that allows her to learn from them. I explain that the length of her self-advocacy will shorten and that\u2019s how she can measure her progress.

      "description": "In Part 1, I tackle a listener question about how to stop comparing herself to other women. I contextualize where this behaviour stems from. Her parents projected their own insecurities onto her by using comparison to other children as a tool to affirm and uplift her. This had the opposite effect, creating a belief that her achievements only exist in competition and contrast with others\u2019, and that to be \u2018up\u2019 someone must be down. Moreover, this behaviour robs her of the opportunity to feel happy for herself and others, independent of jealousy. I detail an incredibly sobering tool I developed years ago that helps contextualize what one is envious of by humanizing the person in comparison.

In Part 2 I answer a listener question about how to safely engage with her ailing, emotionally manipulative mother. The listener is torn between caring for her mother in her time of need, while maintaining her own boundaries, work and general life interests that her mother sees as a direct threat to the love and care she\u2019s receiving. I explain how \u2018fawn\u2019 responders might react to this overwhelming situation, and then detail how to foster a healthier. Firstly, I outline that she must not let her parent assume the role of a child because this forces the listener it0 chase after her mother emotionally. I detail how to mentally establish an \u2018adult-to-adult\u2019 approach and dynamic. From there I go over how to slowly and safely introduce boundaries in a way that still implies love and care for her mother, and that honours the listener\u2019s needs too. I end by encouraging her to have patience and compassion for herself as dealing with such complicated family dynamics as a \u2018fawner\u2019 is incredibly triggering.

In Part 2 I answer a listener question about intuition vs. trauma responses.

I discuss the importance of defence mechanisms and how they\u2019re rooted in experience and your body\u2019s attempt at self-preservation. I then detail the active choice to override your initial defence mechanism response with an intentional tool to ensure your discernment is coming from an objective and carefully considered place.

I then use my journey with chronic dieting and eating disorders to illustrate this. In Part 2 I answer a listener\u2019s question about how to handle a friend who repeatedly crosses their boundaries and who doesn\u2019t make an effort. I use Gottman\u2019s relational theory of \u201Cbid\u2019s for connection\u201D, my theory of \u201Cladder of trust\u201D, and Rosenberg\u2019s theory of nonviolent communication to contextualize their experience and provide possible solutions.

      "description": "In Part 1 I talk about the difference between telling people your boundaries versus living them. I discuss how boundaries are about protecting and honouring ourselves and our standards rather than controlling the behaviour of others. I hone in on the concept of consequences and acknowledge how difficult they are to act out because it places the consequence of a crossed boundary on us and not on the other person. In Part 2 I answer a listener question about how to mourn the death of a relationship they have fantasized about and exaggerated in their mind. I contextualize fantasy as a coping mechanism and not shameful and assure them that fantasy is just as painful as reality. I discuss shame and abandonment issues. In Part 3 I invite a dear friend Taylor Wallis on the show to discuss our obsession with cults, through the lens of the show Keep Sweet, Pray and Obey. \u00A0 To submit a question, you can email it or send a voice recording of your question to be played on the podcast to hello@advancedbitches.com \u00A0 LINKS \u00A0 Taylor Wallis - https://www.instagram.com/taylorwallis/ The Advanced Bitchifesto - https://www.advancedbitches.com/the-bitchifesto Advanced Bitches Bingo - https://www.advancedbitches.com/bingo-instructions \u00A0 Keep up with me: https://www.instagram.com/advancedbitches/ https://www.advancedbitches.com/membership https://www.tiktok.com/@advancedbitches https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCND6RMWO-erRUYMXVOAynWQ \u00A0 My books: \u00A0 The Irreverent Grief Guide:\u00A0\u00A0How to F*cking Survive Months\u00A01-3 https://amzn.to/3sZYalY The Irreverent Trust Guide:\u00A0\u00A0How to Trust Again after Past Trauma F*cked You Up \u00A0https://amzn.to/3JJbIKA \u00A0 Produced by Wowow",

On the flipside, I discuss how ego has sabotaged my efforts, and describe ego as a defensive mechanism in response to stress. In Part 2, I answer a listener question about whether it\u2019s possible for imposter syndrome to show up in romantic relationships. I discuss how imposter syndrome is often just trauma dressed up, and how interrogating negative self-talk and learning about attachment theory could ease their overwhelm. And in Part 3, Trent and I take a deep dive into all things Obi Wan. \u00A0 To submit a question, you can email it or send a voice recording of your question to be played on the podcast to hello@advancedbitches.com \u00A0 LINKS \u00A0 The Advanced Bitchifesto - https://www.advancedbitches.com/the-bitchifesto Advanced Bitches Bingo - https://www.advancedbitches.com/bingo-instructions \u00A0 Keep up with me: https://www.instagram.com/advancedbitches/ https://www.advancedbitches.com/membership https://www.tiktok.com/@advancedbitches https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCND6RMWO-erRUYMXVOAynWQ \u00A0 My books: The Irreverent Grief Guide:\u00A0\u00A0How to F*cking Survive Months\u00A01-3 https://amzn.to/3sZYalY The Irreverent Trust Guide:\u00A0\u00A0How to Trust Again after Past Trauma F*cked You Up \u00A0https://amzn.to/3JJbIKA Produced by Wowow Podcasts",

I discuss ethics that protect patients and therapists from romantic entanglements and leave her with actionable tools to process said feelings within the session itself.

I also discuss how to embrace parts of your personality created from your trauma response and how to identify and leverage the benefits that may be hidden within it.

It took years and years to unlearn self-sabotage, rewrite negative self-talk, forgive myself and others and develop the tools to understand and manage my trauma. Through therapy, and becoming a therapist and life coach myself, I leveled up my mind, body and soul - and have realized my true nature as a confident, self-assured, free woman. Or for short, an Advanced Bitch. And I want this for you, too! Every week I\u2019ll deliver no-nonsense episodes that break down and simplify the dirty work that is transforming your life, one mindset shift at a time. And to let you know, even though I\u2019m a licensed therapist, this podcast is not therapy. If you want to further your healing, please seek out relevant practitioners and join my membership for in-depth, personalized classes.",
