      "description": "This mid-season bonus episode of Nacho Fitness Coach features Kathy Barron, Founder and Editor-in-Chief of Women Who Podcast Magazine and host of the Women Who Sarcast podcast, joining us to talk about one of our favorite uncomfortable topics: fitness cults. We get into how certain fitness programs, brands, and \u201Ccommunities\u201D start out motivational and somehow end up requiring unwavering loyalty, strict rules, and a suspicious lack of questions. Totally normal stuff. We talk about hype culture, influencer authority, and how fitness can quietly shift from something you do into something you\u2019re expected to believe. As always, there are side tangents, sarcasm, and a healthy amount of unserious commentary\u2014but the point still lands: fitness should support your life, not become your personality. And if your workout plan feels more like a belief system than a tool\u2026well. You\u2019re not wrong to think that\u2019s kinda weird.
