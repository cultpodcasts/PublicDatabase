      "description": "Host Noelle Boc has a fascinating conversation with author J.W. Ocker about his book that delves into how smart, normal people can end up enmeshed in extreme cults. He works to answer that question in his book with examples of the most infamous and dangerous cults in history. These include:\n\nBranch Davidians: Led by David Koresh, this cult was waiting out the apocalypse in 1993 when the FBI infamously raided their compound in Waco, Texas.\nNarcosatanists: This cult of drug traffickers in 1980s Mexico was led by Adolfo de Jes\u00FAs Constanzo, who believed he had magic powers and committed human sacrifice.\nBrotherhood of the Seven Rays: The earliest known UFO cult, the infiltration and study of the Brotherhood by psychologists inspired the term \u201Ccognitive dissonance.\u201D\nHo No Hana Sanpogyo: The founder, Hogen Fukunaga, claimed to be able to tell someone\u2019s fortune by examining their feet.\nBreatherianism: Breatherians believe that humans can live on air alone. Their founder, Wiley Brooks, claimed to have gone without food for nineteen years.\nNXIVM: This twenty-first century cult attracted several members of Hollywood and engaged in sex trafficking, forced labor, and racketeering under the guise of personal development seminars.",
