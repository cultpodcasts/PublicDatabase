      "description": "The FLDS broke away from mainstream Mormonism in order to continue the practice of polygamy. They established the community of Short Creek along the Utah/Arizona border to follow their beliefs in isolation. In 2011, their prophet Warren Jeffs was sentenced to life in prison (plus 20 years) for sexual abuse of two of his child brides, ages 12 and 15.\n\nVICE travels to Short Creek to meet with some of the young women who escaped from the cult, who have recently to returned to the town to try to rebuild a new life there.\n\nClick here to SUBSCRIBE to VICE Asia: https://bit.ly/2LhqAR9\n\nConnect with VICE Asia: \nCheck out our full video catalog: https://bit.ly/2P3Y0pv\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com/en_asia\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://fb.com/viceasia/videos/\nLike VICE Asia on Facebook: http://fb.com/viceasia\nFollow VICE Asia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/viceasia\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/viceasia/",
