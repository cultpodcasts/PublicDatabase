      "description": "Look I know this is a guitar channel  but I do play piano too.\nYou will have seen Stephen Ridley pop up in ads before videos here on YouTube. \nHe tells you that you can learn piano really quickly and easily and it\u0027s free. \nExcept you can\u0027t and it isn\u0027t.\nAnd as we all know after the Ken Tamplin thing, I\u0027m not a huge fan of liars. \nSo today we\u0027ll take a look at Stephen Ridley and his over priced piano course and I\u0027ll explain why I have an issue with this.\nI\u0027ll also tell you how you can actually learn piano for a fraction of the cost  of his course. \nI also left you a little video right at the ned as an extra bonus. \nThanks for watching and don\u0027t forget to like and subscribe. \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa446t4UFVUvoIkot03eMHA/join\n\n#stephenridley #piano #learnpiano",
