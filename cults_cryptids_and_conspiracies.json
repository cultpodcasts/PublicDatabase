      "description": "This week we continue our tale of the Source Family as they move into the Mother House. A cult with humble vegetarian and chakra aligning beginnings turns ino something more vile. Listen in to the tale of James Baker, also known as Father Yod, as he manipulated those around him and hurt so many women. Stay safe and don\u0027t trust someone asking you to be his thirteenth wife.

      "description": "This week we finish our sad and grief stricken tale of the Remnant Fellowship. We go over more interpersonal failings within the church and its members and how in this case Religion is just a smokescreen to control those around you. As with all cults these tactics are dangerous so stay alert out there friends. Stay safe and enjoy some holiday cheer.

      "description": "This week we start a two parter about The Weigh Down Diet and the Remnant Fellowship. For Gwen Shamblin things looked real bad and without guidnace she chartered down a dark and abusive path. Remember your health is not tied to your weight no matter what some cultists may tell you. And your weight certainly has nothing to do with god. Be safe out there and look forward to part two next week.
