      "description": "Newly released Justice Department records are drawing attention to a little-known figure in the Jeffrey Epstein saga: Karyna Shuliak, a woman whose name appears inside a secret trust signed just two days before his death. According to court documents, Epstein made one of his last calls from jail to Shuliak \u2014 and named her as a major beneficiary of a trust that referenced his fortune. As millions of pages tied to Jeffrey Epstein continue to be released by the U.S. Department of Justice, questions are growing about who Shuliak is and what role she played in Epstein\u2019s final plans.

Mia described multiple disturbing incidents, including being drugged and raped, fearing for Cassie\u2019s life during violent episodes, and being manipulated into silence under the threat of professional ruin. Her powerful testimony mirrored Cassie\u2019s, as both women described a pattern of abuse by Combs, who denies all allegations.
