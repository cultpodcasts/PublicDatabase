      "description": "As the prosecution\u2019s star witness wrapped up her testimony against disgraced music mogul Sean \u201CDiddy\u201D Combs, a central question has been raised: why did Casandra Ventura continue dating Combs when she alleges he was abusing her?

Law\u0026Crime\u2019s Jesse Weber analyzes the complex psychological implications with forensic psychiatrist Dr. Daniel Bober.\n\nIf you received Depo-Provera birth control shots and were later diagnosed with a brain or spinal tumor called meningioma, you may be eligible for a lawsuit.
