Key testimony includes a former hotel security officer who claims Combs paid $100,000 to suppress assault footage, and several former employees and associates who described payouts tied to NDAs after alleged assaults. While Combs has pleaded not guilty to all charges, the courtroom has heard explosive allegations of abuse, intimidation, and hush money spanning years.
