      "description": "Stacey and Dori turn their attention to Teal Swan, a spiritual influencer whose teachings on healing and suicide have made her both magnetic and deeply controversial. Drawing from the docuseries The Deep End, the hosts unpack how Swan shapes her image, the unsettling dynamics within her inner circle, and why so many vulnerable people are drawn into her orbit. With Dr. John weighing in, the conversation digs into the psychology of manipulation, the ethics of self-proclaimed healers, and what this story reveals about belief, control, and the human need for answers.

      "description": "In this powerful and disturbing episode, Stacey, Dori, and Dr. John take a deep dive into Shiny Happy People, the chilling docuseries exposing the Duggar family and their ties to the Institute in Basic Life Principles (IBLP), a fundamentalist Christian organization led by the controversial Bill Gothard. What lies beneath the surface of big smiles and modesty? Abuse, control, and a dangerous culture of silence. The hosts dissect the teachings and tactics of IBLP, including blanket training, purity culture, and the cult-like authoritarian system that robbed countless women and children of agency and safety. With raw honesty and expert insight, they explore how this toxic ideology went mainstream\u2014fueled by TLC\u2019s reality TV empire\u2014and how survivors are now bravely breaking their silence.",
