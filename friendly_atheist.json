      "description": "Sarah McCammon is a National Political Correspondent for NPR and cohost of The NPR Politics Podcast. Her new book is called \u0022The Exvangelicals: Loving, Living, and Leaving the White Evangelical Church.\u0022\r\n\r\nAffiliate link here: https://bit.ly/43N0y1W\r\n\r\nGrowing up in a deeply evangelical family in the Midwest in the \u201880s and \u201890s, Sarah McCammon was strictly taught to fear God, obey him, and not question the faith. Persistently worried that her gay grandfather would go to hell unless she could reach him, or that her Muslim friend would need to be converted, and that she, too, would go to hell if she did not believe fervently enough, McCammon was a rule-follower and\u2014most of the time\u2014a true believer. But through it all, she was increasingly plagued by fears and deep questions as the belief system she\u0027d been carefully taught clashed with her expanding understanding of the outside world.\r\n\r\nAfter spending her early adult life striving to make sense of an unraveling worldview, by her 30s, she found herself face-to-face with it once again as she covered the Trump campaign for NPR, where she witnessed first-hand the power and influence that evangelical Christian beliefs held on the political right.\r\n\r\nSarah also came to discover that she was not alone: she is among a rising generation of the children of evangelicalism who are growing up and fleeing the fold, who are thinking for themselves and deconstructing what feel like the \u201Calternative facts\u201D of their childhood.\r\n\r\nRigorously reported and deeply personal, The Exvangelicals is the story of the people who make up this generational tipping point, including Sarah herself. Part memoir, part investigative journalism, this is the first definitive book that names and describes the post-evangelical movement: identifying its origins, telling the stories of its members, and examining its vast cultural, social, and political impact.",

That sounds like quite the obstacle for a documentarian, so Theroux does the next best thing: He hires actors to recreate well-documented scenes in Scientology\u0027s history. All the while, the actual Church seems to be keeping tabs on him. Theroux has worked with Michael Moore, and his projects have often focused on interesting subcultures -- everything from the KKK to Westboro Baptist Church. I spoke with him about Scientology\u0027s version of \u0022turn the other cheek,\u0022 the harassment that one key defector of the Church still has to put up with, and what one thing could hurt the Church the most.
