      "description": "This week, we unpack a truly divine scam where self-proclaimed holy rollers stand accused of running a $50M forced labor ring, complete with luxury cars and coerced \u0022donations.\u0022 It\u2019s another classic tale of religious leaders enriching themselves while their flock endures psychological abuse, starvation, and threats of eternal damnation\u2014because nothing says \u0022love thy neighbor\u0022 like a Bentley and a BITE model. We dissect how easily faith can be twisted into a tool for control, exposing the thin veil between spiritual guidance and outright cult behavior. This segment peels back the layers of hypocrisy, reminding us that sometimes, the holiest places harbor the most unholy acts. When religion becomes a weapon for exploitation, who needs actual devils?
