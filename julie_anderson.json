      "title": "INTERVIEW with Bridget Read, author of LITTLE BOSSES EVERYWHERE #antimlm",
      "description": "Join me live on YouTube tomorrow, April 29 at 7pm ET for an interview with Bridget Read, whose new book Little Bosses Everywhere is blasting open the topic of multi-level marketing to the world.\n\nBridget Read is a features writer at New York magazine, reporting on housing inequality and the real estate industry for Curbed. Previously, she wrote for The Cut and was a culture writer at Vogue. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nI was given a digital copy of the book to read and I\u0027m proud to recommend it to victims, to survivors, to friends and family members who have loved ones in MLM, and to anyone who is interested in the topic. There were many times as I was reading it, I\u0027d set my phone down and exclaim, \u0022she gets it!\u0022\n\nBridget breaks down the history of multi-level marketing in a way that is easy to grasp and understand. And most importantly, sought to understand victims, bypassing the typical journalistic narrative of ridiculing victims. The usual talking points of smug judgment and \u0022I would never be sucked into an MLM\u0022 moral superiority are refreshingly absent here. She understands, she explains things so well. I am so excited about this book!\n\nI was also surprised at just how connected MLM is to Amway\u0027s predecessors and how MLMs calculate retail sales...yikes.\n\nLittle Bosses Everywhere will be available to purchase in May 6. I can\u0027t wait to get a hard copy!\n\nPhoto credit in thumbnail: Photo \u00A9 Crown 2025\n\nBridget\u0027s website:  http://www.littlebossesbook.com/\n\nBridget\u0027s Instagram:  @little_bosses_book",

      "description": "Thanks to everyone who has been so supportive of my efforts in raising awareness of the reality of multilevel marketing scams.  \n\nThe suggestion of me accepting money and then donating it to a charity might work for someone else, but for me, it\u0027s another layer of complication that I just don\u0027t want to deal with.  Having to take screenshots and report on a monthly basis where I\u0027m donating money isn\u0027t why I started speaking out against MLMs.\n\nFor me, when money is introduced into content creation, it changes everything. I\u0027m not above being subtly manipulated and a way I can control that is by creating content how I\u0027ve been creating it. I don\u0027t want to start a patreon, I don\u0027t want to create memberships, even me talking about this makes me tired.\n\nI\u0027m going to be taking a break from making videos here. I\u0027ve got one more scheduled for tomorrow and then I\u0027ll be taking time off.\n\nI forgot to mention another reason why I don\u0027t monetize my content and that\u0027s to get through to people still in an MLM cult used to saying, \u0022well you\u0027re just doing it for the money.\u0022 It\u0027s one more way they must face the contradiction of what they\u0027ve been told and what they encounter in the real world.\n\nIf I resume making content here on YouTube it will be me accepting that advertisers will be profiting off my volunteer efforts. It\u0027s too much like MLM for me. And my creativity is squashed just thinking about this.\n\nThe easiest decisions are the ones made for us, and this might be the time I make more content on other platforms where I know ads won\u0027t be placed and people can watch uninterrupted. We\u0027ll see. \n\nThanks again for all of your support, I know this most likely won\u0027t make sense to most people, but as in all my content, my goal is to reach one person. \n\nSee ya out there somewhere. \u2764\uFE0F",

      "description": "Thank you to the antimlm movement on social media for being so supportive of me as I exited MLM and began speaking out.  It is thanks to the antimlm movement at large that many of us are even able to speak out, thank you to everyone who has helped pave the way, without your work, speaking out would be even more difficult.\n\nThank you to the continuing efforts of the antimlm movement across social media for doing the work that academics and regulators refuse to acknowledge - I can now say with certainty that the way forward lies with MLM survivors and their courage in continuing to come forward, speaking out (if they choose), writing their State Attorney Generals, boycotting MLMs.  It\u0027s up to us to spread awareness and education.  The pressure and intimidation to not speak the truth, is real.  I have seen it labeled as extremist and even implied that criticizing the FTC is \u0022anti - antimlm.\u0022  \n\nI, like so many MLM survivors, have been belittled, infantilized, dismissed, insulted, mocked, laughed at by people you would think would want to help survivors:\n\n1. \u0022Research\u0022 that claims that MLM isn\u0027t a problem in the European Union, when a simple Google search shows both Amway and Monat are present in the EU.  \n\n2. The FTC role-playing as an MLM participant attempting to recruit someone (expecting a courtesy laugh), as MLM survivors sat there and looked on.\n\n3.  An \u0022academic\u0022 presentation showing sexualized social media posts from MLM participants as cheap shock value that most academics/regulators in the room laughed at reinforcing the shame and isolation that many ex-MLM participants feel.  \n\n4. Any mention that MLM is fraud was met with a strange mantra from academics and regulators: \u0022People expect change overnight.\u0022  I have no idea who these academics are talking about or talking to, because they certainly aren\u0027t speaking with MLM survivors. \n\n5.  Absolutely no direction, clear guidance on who to contact, what reports to file, how best to word reports.  Why wasn\u0027t there a segment dedicated to this?\n\nFellow advocate, Dave Vaughan has himself put together this document with emails and websites that we can contact and send reports to:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aZbSCRCAo-s1-9ZZitDUftarepFRrnSsXyM167dW_x8/edit?usp=drivesdk\n\nThank you to fellow cult survivors for supporting me in making this speech which as you know I came very close not to delivering, because of what went on.  Thank you very much to Roberta Blevins, Dave Vaughan, Brandie Hadfield, Marco Moukhaiber, Meredith Adams, Erin Bies, Robert FitzPatrick and David Brear.\n\nTo all MLM survivors:  you are not alone.  The corruption runs deep, the gaslighting is on full force, keep speaking out!\n\nTo everyone  who supports the antimlm movement: Each comment, each video view, each conversation you have with a friend/family member raising awareness about these cultic frauds is making a difference.\n\nAnd my presentation and thoughts above are dedicated to all MLM survivors.  \n\nThank you to Brandie Hadfield for videoing this. \n#antimlm",

Cults use language to control members, and MLM is no different.  In order to accurately describe what MLM is it\u0027s important to examine what it is not.  \n\nIn this interview, Robert very clearly explains what MLM is and what it is not and why it\u0027s so important to use accurate language in speaking about these cultic rackets.  \n\nRobert\u0027s website Pyramid Scheme Alert: https://www.pyramidschemealert.org/",
