His childhood was anything but nostalgic as he was force-fed the five Islamic books as doctrine. During university in Jordan, a friend\u2019s admission of atheism ignited something in Fadi, leading him to quietly leave the faith at 21, all under the shadow of apostasy laws. Losing his mother in 2012 became a turning point; Fadi stopped apologizing for who he was and gave up trying to please everyone. Years later, he met his British partner in Qatar, and together they\u2019ve made their way to the UK where they live together with their dogs now, a life he once only dreamed of.\n\nIf you want to connect with Fadi, see his Instagram profile here: https://www.instagram.com/fadizion\n\nJoin Yasmine Mohammed as she delves into the intersection of religion, feminism, and freedom in her latest episode.\n\n\uD83D\uDCA5Support Yasmine\u2019s mission and help amplify the voices of the forgotten feminists\uD83D\uDCA5\n\nFollow Yasmine on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/yasmohammedxx/ \n\nABOUT Yasmine Mohammed\nDiscover Yasmine\u2019s powerful story\u2014grab her book Unveiled: https://www.amazon.com/Unveiled-Weste... \uD83D\uDCDA\n\nSupport her organization, Free Hearts Free Minds, dedicated to helping those suffering under Islamic extremism\u2014donate here: https://freeheartsfreeminds.com \u2764\uFE0F\n\nJOIN Yasmine Mohammed\nTune in to her podcast featuring conversations with unsung heroes from around the world.

Her Saba was rescued by the first Youth Aliyah group along with other children from Lebanon in 1943. He had to leave behind his mother as she was blind and unable to make the trip safely. He served in the Haganah, fighting both in the War of Independence and the 6 day war. He later served as a policeman who guarded the home of the first Israeli Prime Minister Ben Gurion. \nThese stories, that are sadly not uncommon, but are lesser known within the community, sparked Yasmine\u2019s passion for Jewish storytelling and Jewish pride.\n\nFollow Yasmine on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mizrashki.jewess/\n\n\uD835\uDDD4\uD835\uDDD5\uD835\uDDE2\uD835\uDDE8\uD835\uDDE7 \uD835\uDDEC\uD835\uDDEE\uD835\uDE00\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDF6\uD835\uDDFB\uD835\uDDF2 \uD835\uDDE0\uD835\uDDFC\uD835\uDDF5\uD835\uDDEE\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDF2\uD835\uDDF1 \nIf you would like to find out more about Yasmine\u0027s story, click here:  https://www.amazon.com/Unveiled-Western-Liberals-Empower-Radical/dp/B084HBTTMM/\n\nIf you would like to support Yasmine\u0027s organization, click here: https://freeheartsfreeminds.com\n\n\uD835\uDDDD\uD835\uDDE2\uD835\uDDDC\uD835\uDDE1 \uD835\uDDEC\uD835\uDDEE\uD835\uDE00\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDF6\uD835\uDDFB\uD835\uDDF2 \uD835\uDDE0\uD835\uDDFC\uD835\uDDF5\uD835\uDDEE\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDF2\uD835\uDDF1\nGo to www.https://www.yasminemohammed.com/podcast to join Yasmine Mohammed in conversation with inspirational people from all over the world.

Gad was born in Beirut, Lebanon to a Jewish family with roots in Syria. As a child, the antisemitism his family encountered is one of the reasons why they fled from Lebanon to Canada. And now in Canada, he has to hear professors telling students to \u201Cgo back to Poland\u201D in reference to Auschwitz and the Holocaust where millions of Jewish people were murdered. Gad and I spoke about antisemitism in the Arab world and how disorienting it is for us to see it so naked in the west today, with students in Columbia University in NY asking for Hamas to make them proud and burn Tel Aviv to the ground. As one of the few voices who was warning about where this capitulation to extremism could lead, we will find out how Gad feels now that he is being \u2018vindicated\u2019 and how he thinks we can move beyond this crisis.\n\n\uD835\uDDD4\uD835\uDDD5\uD835\uDDE2\uD835\uDDE8\uD835\uDDE7 \uD835\uDDEC\uD835\uDDEE\uD835\uDE00\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDF6\uD835\uDDFB\uD835\uDDF2 \uD835\uDDE0\uD835\uDDFC\uD835\uDDF5\uD835\uDDEE\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDF2\uD835\uDDF1 \nIf you would like to find out more about Yasmine\u0027s story, click here:  https://www.amazon.com/Unveiled-Western-Liberals-Empower-Radical/dp/B084HBTTMM/\n\nIf you would like to support Yasmine\u0027s organization, click here: https://freeheartsfreeminds.com\n\n\uD835\uDDDD\uD835\uDDE2\uD835\uDDDC\uD835\uDDE1 \uD835\uDDEC\uD835\uDDEE\uD835\uDE00\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDF6\uD835\uDDFB\uD835\uDDF2 \uD835\uDDE0\uD835\uDDFC\uD835\uDDF5\uD835\uDDEE\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDF2\uD835\uDDF1\nGo to www.https://www.yasminemohammed.com/podcast to join Yasmine Mohammed in conversation with inspirational people from all over the world.

Growing up in the USA in the state of Tennessee, she struggled with the multitude of restrictions placed on her, especially since she was female.\n\nThe inner conflict she experienced led to decades of depression and self-loathing. A series of events beginning with the market crash of 2008 led her to deep inner work including personal development, meditation, and intuitive development practices. Eventually, her inner guidance system became so strong that she was able to drop the chains of her prescribed religion and live authentically.\n\nAlthough a multi-business owner, Iffath is focused on sharing her story to help others. She hopes to shine a light in the dark for anyone who yearns to live in alignment with their true selves.\n\nIffath lives outside of Atlanta, GA with her real estate developer husband and three amazing children.

She was subjected to the Male Guardianship Law, which stripped her of every right that she was born with as an American Citizen.\n\nShe works diligently to highlight the current situation on the ground in Saudi Arabia not just because she has three younger Saudi sisters and many Saudi friends but because she personally suffered many injustices until finally finding freedom in the United States at the age of thirty.\n\nShe has spoken internationally and locally, raising awareness about the Male Guardianship Law, Sports-Washing, Arbitrary Arrests, Torture, Victim Shaming, Forced Disappearances, Honor Killings, Sham Trials, Executions, and other Human Rights Violations happening on a day-to-day basis in Saudi Arabia.\n\nShe interned for the United Nations Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS) in Riyadh, and was the head of HR for the MENA Region for The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Dubai. She worked as the Executive Assistant to the group Publisher at D Magazine in Dallas, TX and is currently a successful CEO.

On September 15, 2022, he was fired by the Alberta government due to the demands of the National Council of Canadian Muslims.\n\nHe was accused of \u2018Islamophobia\u2019 by the NDP citing a 13 year old academic book review that Collin wrote for a book written by Middle East Historian Efraim Karsh. They claimed the book review was \u201Cracist, Islamophobic and hateful\u201D. Under pressure from those wielding this semantic weapon \u2018Islamophobia\u2019, the weak conservative provincial government fired him after only a few months in his new position.\n\nJoin us to speak with Collin to learn the details of how this baseless and obviously politically motivated character assassination has entirely disrupted his life and his livelihood.\n\n\uD835\uDDD4\uD835\uDDD5\uD835\uDDE2\uD835\uDDE8\uD835\uDDE7 \uD835\uDDEC\uD835\uDDEE\uD835\uDE00\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDF6\uD835\uDDFB\uD835\uDDF2 \uD835\uDDE0\uD835\uDDFC\uD835\uDDF5\uD835\uDDEE\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDF2\uD835\uDDF1 \nIf you would like to find out more about Yasmine\u0027s story, click here:  https://www.amazon.com/Unveiled-Western-Liberals-Empower-Radical/dp/B084HBTTMM/\n\nIf you would like to support Yasmine\u0027s org, click here: https://freeheartsfreeminds.com\n\n\uD835\uDDDD\uD835\uDDE2\uD835\uDDDC\uD835\uDDE1 \uD835\uDDEC\uD835\uDDEE\uD835\uDE00\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDF6\uD835\uDDFB\uD835\uDDF2 \uD835\uDDE0\uD835\uDDFC\uD835\uDDF5\uD835\uDDEE\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDF2\uD835\uDDF1\nGo to www. https://www.yasminemohammed.com/podcast to join Yasmine Mohammed in conversation with inspirational people from all over the world.

      "description": "Sara was born in a (mostly) secular family in an extremely religious country. She left Iran when realized she would never see her 30th birthday if she stayed any longer. Since last September, and the start of the revolution in Iran, she has started talking to her therapist more about her experiences in Iran, which led her therapist to diagnose Sara with PTSD, severe anxiety, minor depression and panic disorder, realizing how severely she was affected and how she barely survived the Islamic Regime. Sara has two cats that she loves dearly and \u0022a husband who is just as Islamophobic as I am\u0022. Join me and Sara as we talk about her traumatic experiences with Islam and how it has affected her as well as how the #WomanLifeFreedom revolution has helped her to realize that she\u0027s not as lonely as she used to believe.\n\n\uD835\uDDD4\uD835\uDDD5\uD835\uDDE2\uD835\uDDE8\uD835\uDDE7 \uD835\uDDEC\uD835\uDDEE\uD835\uDE00\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDF6\uD835\uDDFB\uD835\uDDF2 \uD835\uDDE0\uD835\uDDFC\uD835\uDDF5\uD835\uDDEE\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDF2\uD835\uDDF1 \nIf you would like to find out more about Yasmine\u0027s story, click here:  https://www.amazon.com/Unveiled-Western-Liberals-Empower-Radical/dp/B084HBTTMM/\n\nIf you would like to support Yasmine\u0027s org, click here: https://freeheartsfreeminds.com\n\n\uD835\uDDDD\uD835\uDDE2\uD835\uDDDC\uD835\uDDE1 \uD835\uDDEC\uD835\uDDEE\uD835\uDE00\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDF6\uD835\uDDFB\uD835\uDDF2 \uD835\uDDE0\uD835\uDDFC\uD835\uDDF5\uD835\uDDEE\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDF2\uD835\uDDF1\nGo to www. https://www.yasminemohammed.com/forgottenfeminists to join Yasmine Mohammed in conversation with inspirational people from all over the world.

The religion has a very small following of 6 million worldwide and comprises little more than .5% of the population in India. She had questions about Jainism from a very young age. She was different from others - she noticed that early on: where others accepted the beliefs and status quo, she wanted to know why. Her curious mind always had questions and wanted answers that made sense to her. Today she is a rational egoist and does not believe in or follow any religion.

      "description": "\uD83C\uDF1FLina grew up a minority Christian in Cairo, Egypt. Frustrated with the sexist society around her, she moved to Canada in her 20s. Here she discovered that, in the name of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, people in the West fail to realize that within every cultural community, there are some unique minds and souls that think differently, and they deserve an equal opportunity to be heard and to express their views. In order to try and correct this egregious wrong, she published a book called \u0022Liberation \u2013 Secrets of the Soul,\u201D it is a collection of short stories, revealing existential moments in the lives of ordinary women, from a variety of cultural backgrounds, as they journey to self-fulfillment. \n\nOrder Lina\u0027s book here: https://www.amazon.com/Liberation-Secrets-Soul-Short-Stories/dp/1989048595\n\nFollow Lina on Instagram: lina.girgis\n\u2014\n\u201CForgotten Feminists, with host Yasmine Mohammed, is an opportunity for you to join in on the conversations with inspirational women from the Muslim majority world who have fought and who have overcome.

      "description": "\uD83C\uDF1FIn some ways Anya and I are total opposites and in other ways, we lived parallel lives. While I was tyrannized by a far right ideology, her experience was that of tyranny from the far left. Anya is from the Soviet Union. As everybody else there, she was heavily brainwashed into the communist ideology. While she didn\u0027t have to wear a hijab, there was plenty she was forced to do, think, and say - whether she liked it or not. She is of Jewish descent and, due to systemic antisemitism, her options in life were limited. She had to wonder, which university is accepting Jews? Which jobs are open to Jews? etc. It took her years of reading books that were prohibited, having discussions with trusted friends and thinking, thinking, thinking to clean-up her mind and open it up to free critical thinking. \n\n\u2014\n\u201CForgotten Feminists, with host Yasmine Mohammed, is an opportunity for you to join in on the conversations with inspirational women from the Muslim majority world who have fought and who have overcome.

      "description": "\uD83C\uDF1FSamira is half Arab, half Danish, however growing up the cultural and religious values of her father were way stronger thank her Danish side. When she became a teenager, the conflict between her two cultures caused a lot of turmoil and confusion for many years. She eventually felt the only way to free herself from the dichotomy was to leave Islam. But the break was a painful one. Her family disowned her for her choice to liberate herself and she missed her dad and her siblings. After a tragic loss of my first husband (an American non Muslim), she went back to her family with her 4 year old daughter. She was so devastated from the loss of her love that she decided to convert back to Islam and marry her cousin. Her second marriage was a disaster. Life under such strict rules was hell. After two years she left with both her kids, took off her hijab, and never looked back. But living under suppressed rules for so long had left an impact. At first after leaving Islam she was in no man\u0027s land. She felt ashamed for showing my hair and wearing normal clothes. There are so many long, difficult, and lonely phases to leaving Islam. So much rebuilding that needs to happen- especially for women. Samira and I will talk about all those challenges and offer advice for other women starting on their journey to freedom.\n\n\u2728\uD835\uDDD4\uD835\uDDD5\uD835\uDDE2\uD835\uDDE8\uD835\uDDE7 \uD835\uDDEC\uD835\uDDEE\uD835\uDE00\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDF6\uD835\uDDFB\uD835\uDDF2 \uD835\uDDE0\uD835\uDDFC\uD835\uDDF5\uD835\uDDEE\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDF2\uD835\uDDF1\u2728 \nIf you would like to find out more about Yasmine\u0027s story, click here:  https://www.amazon.com/Unveiled-Western-Liberals-Empower-Radical/dp/B084HBTTMM/\n\nIf you would like to support Yasmine\u0027s org, click here: https://freeheartsfreeminds.com\n\n\uD83C\uDF41\uD835\uDDDD\uD835\uDDE2\uD835\uDDDC\uD835\uDDE1 \uD835\uDDEC\uD835\uDDEE\uD835\uDE00\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDF6\uD835\uDDFB\uD835\uDDF2 \uD835\uDDE0\uD835\uDDFC\uD835\uDDF5\uD835\uDDEE\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDFA\uD835\uDDF2\uD835\uDDF1\uD83C\uDF41\nGo to www. https://www.yasminemohammed.com/forgottenfeminists to join Yasmine Mohammed in conversation with inspirational people from all over the world.

She is the founder of Arab Women\u2019s Voice and she co-founded the Yemeni American Coalition for Change to support grassroots movements in the Middle East during the Arab Spring. Rabyaah was also chosen as a national Bernie surrogate in the 2020 Presidential race. Rabyaah began to question the extremists in her community and the Islamists in US government around the Arab Spring. Her criticisms caused so much backlash, but it didn\u0027t stop her. She is committed to continuing to speak out for the good of her community- as she wants to see Muslims progress and prosper.
