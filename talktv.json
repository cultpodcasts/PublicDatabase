At three years old, Serena was given to the Supreme Leader David Berg as a child bride by her mother. \n\nIt was in his household that she alleges facing constant mental, physical and sexual abuse and being forced to appear in child pornography videos. \n\nThe group, which was founded in 1968 by Berg, began as a new religious movement focused on spreading the Christian message. \n\nBut, as the decades progressed and the group evolved, it began to attract the attention of the international media with regards to its practices involving children. \n\nAnd even after she escaped to the US aged 18 in 2001, it took her years to come to terms with the bottled up trauma from her childhood. \n\nBut in 2017, she began her training to become a Trauma Recovery Specialist, becoming the person she wished she had had when she was looking for help. \n\nThis is her story. \n\nClick here for more from TalkTV https://talk.tv\n\nIf you need any help visit: https://talk.tv/helplines\n\n#cult #cults #survival #survivor",
