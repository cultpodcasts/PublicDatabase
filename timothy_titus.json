      "description": "If you like the video, then please support the channel by hitting the like button as it will really help with spreading awareness of spiritual abuse within church cults. \n\nThis video reports on cult behaviour where a woman is shunned by her own family just because she no longer wants to attend \u0027The Gospel\u0027 church also known as The \u0027Gospel\u0027 cult.. \n\nIt is important to note that The Gospel cult has around 80 members including men, women, children and infants. And is completely independent with no other branches. \n\nFurthermore, the autocratic pastor\u0027s wife has done a runner and alleges that her husband has been abusive to her on many occasions.\n\nThis autocratic pastor claims to be a \u0027spiritual covering\u0027 over his church and the members of the church truly believe they must be under his covering to receive salvation! \uD83D\uDE2E Yet, the pastor cannot even cover his own wife. \n\nWake up guys and stop believing in this \u0027spiritual covering\u0027 rubbish. The spiritual covering non-sense is a false teaching designed to exploit you and control you. \n\n*1 Timothy 3:4-5 An overseer must manage his own household well and keep his children under control, with complete dignity. 5For if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how can he care for the church of God?*",
