      "description": "What do Neil Gaiman, Scientology, and NDAs have in common? More than you\u0027d think\u2014and none of it is good.\nJoin hosts Shannon Perez-Darby and Tashmica Torok as they break down the allegations, the power imbalances, and the larger cultural problem with how we talk (or don\u2019t talk) about consent. Listen in as they unpack why we need better ways to talk about sexual violence\u2014because the binary of \u0022totally consensual\u0022 or \u0022definitely rape\u0022 just doesn\u2019t cut it.\nThey also get into:\nWhy we struggle to ask for what we want in relationships.The difference between \u0022sexy hitting\u0022 and just... hitting.Consent practices we can learn from BDSM.Neil Gaiman\u2019s deep ties to Scientology (because of course).The weirdness of trying to buy your way out of accountability.\nIf you\u0027ve ever side-eyed a dude who says he\u0027s a feminist but also just happens to have a long history of dating barely legal women, or if you\u0027ve ever wondered what happens when you mix cult-like obedience structures with unchecked power... well, this one\u0027s for you.\nThis Week\u2019s Pop Culture Homework\nThis episode of The Popaganda Podcast is inspired by the podcast Master: The Allegations Against Neil Gaiman.\u00A0\nSubscribe and listen everywhere you get your podcasts.

To which Shannon and Tashmica say, \u201CWhat now?\u201D The Popaganda Podcast kicks off season 2 with a conversation about \u201CTom Cruise on Tom Cruise, Scientologist\u201D. An American actor, producer, and celebrity Scientologist, Tom Cruise is the lead in major blockbuster films like Top Gun and the spy series Mission: Impossible. As latchkey kids, we will never forget him jumping on Oprah\u2019s couch over his love for Katie Holmes. Long since divorced under questionable circumstances, Cruise has given millions to a religious organization despite repeated accusations of abuse and he\u2019s never been canceled. How does he do it? *insert Kate Bornstein \u0026#43; Leah Remini sideeye* Tune in as cohosts Shannon Perez-Darby and Tashmica Torok discuss how cults, communes, and even nonprofit organizations can use power and control dynamics to hurt people. Could a healthy practice of accountability change everything? Let\u0027s talk about it! Come for the pop culture. Stay for the abolition. For more information, visit www.popagandapod.com.
