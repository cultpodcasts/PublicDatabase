      "description": "In this vulnerable episode of Poison Honey podcast, I speak with Christina about her extraordinary journey from growing up in radical religious groups to finding her authentic self. Christina shares her experience of joining a Bible college community that gradually transformed into a cult-like environment, complete with public humiliation rituals and shunning of members who questioned leadership.\nChristina details her powerful story of slowly reconnecting with her body, intuition, and true self after years of disconnection. We explore how physical practices like hula became gateways to healing, the process of deconstructing faith, and how the question \u0022What if I believe in unicorns?\u0022 became a powerful metaphor for challenging imposed belief systems. This conversation touches on spiritual deconstruction, finding freedom from religious trauma, and the importance of creating your own path.\n#ReligiousTrauma #CultSurvivor #SpiritualDeconstruction #PoisonHoney #AuthenticityJourney\n\nGuest: Christina Carlson\nhttps://christinamcarlson.com/\n\nHost: Maanarak of Grey\nhttps://www.maanarak.art",
