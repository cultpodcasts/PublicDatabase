The show dives deep into the lives and misdeeds of history\u2019s most notorious criminals, as well as some of the wildest crimes you\u2019ve never heard of. Fraud, theft, murder, and worse \u2014 whatever the case, whoever the criminal \u2014 you don\u2019t know the whole story\u2026 until now. Past seasons have covered: A series of bombings that shook Salt Lake City, with rare Mormon documents at the center of the mystery. The woman who built the modern adoption industry by stealing babies and selling them to desperate parents. A serial killer duo who claimed responsibility for as many as 600 murders across the country. The shocking assassinations of civil rights leaders Medgar Evers and Harvey Milk. The newest season investigates NXIVM \u2014 the modern-day cult disguised as a self-help seminar business. In 2017, NXIVM suddenly hit front pages nationwide. One day, no one had heard of it. The next, it was being exposed as a cult \u2014 with stories of a secret society, psychological manipulation, imprisonment, and sexual abuse. At its center was founder Keith Raniere \u2014 a self-styled genius his followers called \u201CVanguard.\u201D For decades, he used his charisma and manipulation to quietly build an empire. But behind the mask of self-improvement was something much darker: Raniere\u2019s obsession with control over the women in his inner circle. When some began to resist, he tightened his grip, resorting to blackmail and coercion to keep them trapped \u2014 until his victims finally spoke out. This is the story of NXIVM.

Through riveting excerpts from the leader\u0027s written messages to the church and his family, the episode vividly illustrates the depths of conditioning and control exerted over the congregation.\u0022Cloaks of Humility\u0022 sheds light on the manipulative tactics used to disguise control as selfless devotion, providing a compelling and eye-opening account of life within Crusade Church.",

This time, we delve into a particularly harrowing chapter of his life, one that left a lasting scar on his psyche.At the tender age of 15, Mattie experienced a period of isolation, forced to spend \u0022Forty Days \u0026 Forty Nights\u0022 away from his family, church, and friends. This extreme and psychologically damaging ordeal was orchestrated within the confines of the religious cult led by their father, shrouding Mattie\u0027s adolescence in darkness and despair.Joining Mattie in this deeply personal and revealing episode are his sisters, Jen and Ashleigh, the former providing crucial insights into the emotional and psychological torment they all endured during this time \u0026 the latter only learning of this ordeal recently.This episode continues to unravel the layers of dysfunction within their family and the oppressive grip of their father\u0027s religious cult. The narrative illustrates the profound impact of this forty-day ordeal on Mattie, who, at such a vulnerable age, grappled with an unfathomable degree of pain, fear, and uncertainty.Let\u2019s get social!: https://linktr.ee/cultnextdoorpodcast We\u2019d love to hear from you.
