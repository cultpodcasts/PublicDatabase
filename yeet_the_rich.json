      "description": "We are back for More Lularoe! Last ep we talked about how this small MLM turned into a massive problem and almost definitely a pyramid scheme. Mostly women and often stay at home moms were turning to Lularoe to make some extra money but instead were going into debt just to break even. The only people truely benefiting were Founders Mark and Deanne Stidhan and those lucky few that got in early and were getting massive bonuses for recruiting. The quality of the clothing was getting worse and the quality of the design was plummeting. But they went from 5,000 retailers to 80,000 in less than three years. So the scam outgrew their ability to control it and, the cracks are starting to show. This week we are going to fully get into them!We will talk about the logistical failings, the companies use of cult tactics to control and manipulate their retailers, and then the MANY MANY lawsuits! Enjoy!

      "description": "This week we are talking about LuLaRoe and it is a fun one! LuLaRoe is a clothing company known for their \u201CButtery Soft Leggings\u201D and bold patterns. With Promises of full time pay for part time work, The Lularoe life appealed to many people in America struggling to make ends meet. Especially women and often stay at home moms who may have just left their job to begin their family. Established in 2013 it reached its height in 2016-2017 with nearly $2 billion in sales and 80000 independent \u201CFashion Consultants\u201D selling lularoe clothing. Consultants would spend tens of thousands of dollars buying leggings and dresses in bulk and do their best to make their \u201Cinvestment back\u201D. Luckily for these struggling retailers there was a second way to make money at Lularoe: Recruitment. The more people you recruited the more money you would get. As the company got bigger and bigger it began to look less and less like a Legging company and more and more like a Pyramid. Less like a way for struggling families to make some extra cash and more like a predatory machine funneling money up to the very top of the food chain. Enjoy!
