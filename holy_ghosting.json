      "description": "From my first comic, the chick track, chit-trak, christ-trick?!?  The christian hell-comic given to children on halloween to scare them into submission to finding my way as an adult into fully embracing the comic world I\u0027d say I\u0027ve come a long way baby. The conversation with Andrea Gilroy is a gentle reminder that resistance is existence and living a good life is valuable too. \nIn an era where voices are silenced, and stories are censored, embracing and supporting spaces that offer uncensored narratives is more crucial than ever.\n\n* Artistic Resistance: Andrea shares her insights on how comics have historically challenged societal norms and offered a platform for collective power and identity expression. With her expertise in comics history, she delves into how these narratives confront binaries and foster world-building.\n\n* Comics and Community: Explore the role of local comic shops like Books with Pictures in creating safe communities and resisting censorship, especially in times when book banning is prevalent.\n\n* Saga\u2019s Universe: We scratch the surface of the epic story of \u0022Saga,\u0022 a comic series that epitomizes the struggle for identity and belonging in a vast universe, mirroring our own challenges in society.",

In this episode, our Holy Ghosting triumvirate share the ways their paths wound from compulsory heteronormativity toward full awareness of their unique sexualities. \n\nIn this episode topics include feeling like imposters, finding acceptance and love in the LGBTQIA2S\u002B\u002B\u002B community, and navigating the aftermath of a lifetime of mandatory sexual repression. \n\nContent Warning: welp. These broads definitely talk a lot about LGBTQIA2s\u002B history including discussion of internalized homophobia, general homophobia as disseminated by the evangelical right wing from the 80\u2019s until\u2026um, right now, and honestly, the hosts are wont to talk about sexual trauma kind of a lot.

      "description": "Season 1 | Episode 2\n\nWhat does one do with the conundrum of abortion? When Lindsay, Meg, and Sarai were growing up, the Evangelical Christian stance on abortion was never, ever, no way, no how. The church made specious (and racist, xenophobic, peri-holocaust denying or at best minimizing) arguments meant to tug at the heartstrings of nice, Christian, white ladies. Present-day: billboards litter the interstates of America, showing bright-eyed (almost exclusively white) babies with ominous words like \u201Cabortion stops a beating heart\u201D emblazoned across their tidily diapered butts; pro-choice and pro-life people don\u2019t even speak the same language much less know how to fight in the same battle; and the powers that be have successfully edged Roe v Wade toward the dustbin of history. \n\nEnter some deconstructing, young former Evangelicals (one of whom shamefully admitted she voted for George W. Bush\u2026TWICE) and they start to ask questions about this once untouchable medical procedure. Your 40-ish mom friends talk through the taboo tornado of purity culture (patriarchy), Nice Christian White Ladies (white supremacy), and hit action movies from bygone decades, oh and abortion...all while we realize it was never really about the babies\u2026and Evangelicals didn\u2019t give any toots about abortion until, like, a year or two before our hosts were all born. How would we have known when we were standing on the streets in our respective hometowns begging people to just realize that life begins at conception (but where does conception begin? Oh\u2026I think we\u2019re in an inception now)\u2026anyway\u2026give it a listen! And join the conversation with us at HolyGhosting.com\n\nIf you or someone you know needs abortion healthcare call the NAF Hotline at 1-800-772-9100 for help and to learn about safe options for ending a pregnancy.\n\nTikTok @holyghosting\nInstagram \u0026 Twitter @holyghostingpod",

      "description": "In this episode, we dive into the not-so-wonderful world of Youth With a Mission, aka YWAM. We chat with our pal (and Lindsay\u2019s sister), D.L. Mayfield about the history and horrors of the cult-like organization that began with one white guy\u0027s vision of young people sweeping the globe for Jesus. (Totally not creepy, right?) Fast forward a few decades and YWAM is one of the largest missions organizations on the planet, with 1100 locations in 180\u0026#43; countries and over 18,000 (unpaid!) staff. It should come as no surprise to our listeners that YWAM is super problematic.. We get into all the cultiest aspects of this organization - from their Discipleship Training School to the forced trauma bonding that they call \u201CPlumbline\u201D. YWAM\u2019s entire model is recruiting young people - before their prefrontal cortexes are fully formed - and they make it VERY hard to leave. If you do manage to escape the cult of YWAM, chances are you\u2019ll be left with zero real-life skills with a side of religious trauma. We\u2019ll be back in a few weeks with a part 2 where we hear from friends and listeners about their about their firsthand encounters with YWAM.

      "description": "In our latest episode we jump into the turbulent waters of gendered messages and purity culture with a critical eye on the Christian advice book, \u0027For Young Women Only\u0027\u2014or as we like to call it, \u201CHow to NOT Cause a Guy to Stumble.\u201D Published in the early 2000s, this book perpetuates harmful beliefs about gender, sexuality, and the role of women in the church, echoing through youth groups and beyond. We dissect the enforced performance of masculinity, the unjust objectification of women\u0027s bodies, and the dangerous overlap of rape and purity cultures that unjustly places blame on women. Our discussion goes deeper, challenging the control exerted over thoughts and visuals, the male gaze, and the relentless standards set by modesty teachings and visual temptations, all underscored by eyebrow-raising survey results from teenage boys. This episode is an unflinching conversation about the impacts of sexual assault and harassment, underscoring the urgent need for autonomy, consent education, and a seismic shift in attitudes toward women\u0027s bodies and choices. Get ready, Ghosties, to break free from the shackles of high-control religion. It\u0027s time to unravel the mess, advocate for bodily autonomy, and maybe, just maybe, start healing.

      "description": "What happens when a homeschooled horse girl feels \u201Cgod put Africa on her heart?\u201D Well. It could be a lot of things. In fact, your own fave Ghostie Hostie, Lindsay, was exactly this kind of girlie. And yet! Just as two paths diverge in a yellow wood, so do our choices take us to different places. Lindsay, for one, went on a medical mission to Uganda, wore scrubs, and - shockingly - didn\u2019t perform a single medical intervention that would require training, certification, or licensure. For Renee Bach, the white missionary who is the subject of Savior Complex an HBO Original Documentary Series, she chose a path (hopefully) less taken and went full speed ahead providing services that were way beyond her training and competency - with dire results. Join your thrilling throuple, Lindsay, Meg, and Sarai, as they discuss the second half of the Max docuseries, Savior Complex. Listen to Part One of our Recap Here They get down and dirty into the accusations surrounding Renee as No White Saviors picks up momentum online, talk a whole load of shit about Renee\u2019s doting mother, Laurie Bach, and wrestle with the centering of white voices and behaviors that are rife within this story (including ours!) While it\u2019s useful, at times, to wrap our minds around something by defaulting to narratives with good guys and bad guys (or\u2026good homeschool horse girls vs bad ones?), real life is much more complicated than all that. What we end up with is a very gray story with a lot of problematic white women centering themselves in it. Which you can hear more of while your ghostie hosts do a little of that too, hopefully in a helpful way.

Well, today your favorite Apostolic Apostates, Lindsay, Meg, and Sarai join forces with Meredith Holley of Eris Resolution to dig into the basics of Empowered Communication. Learn how to find your voice, how high control religion taught us disempowered communication strategies, and get ready for some juicy gossip about how Meredith\u0027s first betrothal (at the age of 7) worked out. Meredith is the cohost of The Empowered Communication Podcast, which focuses primarily on workplace communication. Meredith was also a civil rights litigator, expert shit talker, and - Oh! Also?

Short answer: Howsoever you fucking want; but more specifically, it\u0027s something you get to work out with fear and trembling, just like you probably did with your own salvation. Join your fave apostates as they discuss what this strange post-pandemic peri-apocalyptic year has wrought - at least at a micro-level. \u0026#x1f50d; Lindsay\u0027s Leap: From the tangled threads of faith, Lindsay\u0027s been unraveling a spirituality that\u0027s as authentic as her favorite pair of jeans. Spoiler: It\u0027s a perfect fit. \u0026#x1f308; Sarai\u0027s Shift: Breaking free from a long-term relationship, Sarai embraced her full, fabulous queerness. It\u0027s a story of transformation, glitter, and growing into her own. \u0026#x1f4ab; Meg\u0027s Metamorphosis: God, the universe, and everything in between - Meg\u0027s been reshaping her beliefs and sexuality into a mosaic that\u0027s uniquely hers. Be it laughter or lamentation, your hosts unwrap the lessons learned, hopes for the future, and the reality that sometimes...it\u0027s just gonna be dark for a while, even while you\u0027re living into your fullest, biggest self. Dare to jump into the fray and reflect on the places you\u0027ve been this year - and where you hope to walk in the coming journey around the sun. If you\u0027re anything like the Unholy Trinity (Lindsay, Meg, and Sarai), you might have occasion to peel back layers on healing generational trauma, tap into your own power, and maybe even learning how and when to ask for help. Join with all Ghosties everywhere to co-create an inclusive community, dreaming up vibrant futures, and setting those oh-so-important boundaries. Let\u0027s celebrate the journey of being wonderfully, messily human together. #SelfDiscovery #FaithJourney #QueerPride #GenerationalHealing #HolyGhostingPodcast Support Here Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/holy-ghosting/exclusive-content Advertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brands Privacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

They also take a perplexing look at why Christians are such brilliant capitalists whilst claiming they follow a broke carpenter who, apparently, \u0022never asked for a raise\u0022 (listen if you want to be extra grossed out by what this actually means). Bottom line: we get into what we thought and bought as young Christian babes. Hear how Lindsay worked in not one, but TWO Christian bookstores. Learn how Sarai does real time podcast research to confirm her suspicions that the White Jesus Gets Us (erm, \u0022He Gets Us\u0022) ad campaign has something to do with politics (shockingly, it does!)...and enjoy as Meg reveals her strange and wonderful journey from coveter of \u0022the hottest Bibles\u0022 to Christian Bookstore-eschewing crone.

Get ready to think again: it\u0027s ok to want sex (contrary to popular DC Talk lyrics). \n\nJoin your triumphant trio as they talk with Dr. Laura Anderson about the literal pain and trauma that purity culture leaves in its wake. Did you, for instance, know that sex is supposed to feel good????? And that feeling good includes not having pain? \n\nAnd what about that interesting \u0022you\u0027re not married yet so shut that sexual anything down ASAP\u0022 to \u0022you\u0027re married now, you gotta let that P into your V full force, or you\u0027re bad\u0022 transition? That\u0027s fun! No? It\u0027s terrible? OK, you\u0027re not wrong. \n\nLong story short here? Purity culture is a disaster for all the people it has harmed, continues to harm today, and will continue to harm well into the future - unless....hear me out...unless, we refuse to let sexual repression ruin our experience of being human. Join us and learn how a few chaste women entered their permanent slut era, or at least have found some nice ways to reach orgasm.

It\u0027s an episode about feminism and motherhood and all of the fun messages we were taught about being a Good Christian Girl\u2122!\n\nIn this episode we get into all the nitty gritty of what it means to identify as a woman in The United States of Evangelical America. \n\nHere are just a few of the things we cover:\n\n-The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA)\n-Concerned Women for America and the work of Phyllis Schlafly (spoiler: she\u0027s not in favor of equal rights for women! Not great!)\n-The (very few) positive female role models that exist in the Bible (and what was so wrong with Vashti anyway? And Jezebel got a bad rap!)\n-SPAGHETTI STRAPS AND THE PROBLEM OF SHOWING TOO MUCH SEXY SHOULDER\n-The mixed messages about what it meant to be a woman in Evangelical Christianity\n-Passing the Bechdel Test in your own damn IG bio\n-How Mothers are treated like garbage in this country. Paid maternity leave and free healthcare for all, plz.\n-The church\u2019s insistence on giving women carnations on Mother\u2019s Day. WHY?\n-How it\u2019s none of your business if people are going to have a baby or not! (Lookin\u2019 at you, Vanessa Lachey)\n-You can be anything and do anyone! You can change your name or your gender! You don\u2019t have to take your husband\u2019s name!\n-Motherhood is not the highest and only calling for women. It is a choice and we support your choice to be or not to be a mother. Period.\n-Motherhood is a gift and also a pain in the ass. Happy Mother\u2019s Day, call your senators, and support the Equal Rights Amendment.

We do! And bonus: Fina of the Mindful Minds podcast cares about this too, so buckle up as she joins the Unfaithful Few, Lindsay, Meg, and Sarai, on today\u2019s episode. \n\n\nLearn about how uncannily (and horrifically) THE SAME it is to grow up in the Evangelical church as a human being, especially one who is not a cis man, as it was 20 years ago when these middle aged mom friends got all tangled up in purity culture. Fina, a relatively recent college grad, tells your aghast hosts about her life in the church as a volunteer and as a survivor of sexual assault. Not only is this lack of evolution unacceptable, but it is also time for these institutions and the people who participate in them to take accountability for the lives they have failed to care about and support. It\u2019s not pretty, and it\u2019s not cool, but it\u2019s true and happening - so let\u2019s talk about it and uncover ways we might make different choices for ourselves now, as we heal from the experience of exploitation and repression the church foisted upon us. And more importantly, let\u2019s start looking at ways religious institutions must catch up with the rest of society in some key ways.",

If you or someone you know is struggling with thoughts about taking their own lives, please dial the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988. Hey, Ghosties! What a day. As you know by now, Holy Ghosting is celebrating Pride this month with weekly episodes about different aspects of LGBTQ\u0026#43; and Evangelicalism. This week, we are talking about Coming Out - and bonus: you\u0027ll get to hear directly from four listeners about how their entanglements with the church have worked out after they came out. Some folks are still (non-Evangelical) Christians, and others are no longer religious. All of them have something important to share about the challenges of being alienated from one\u0027s own sense of self, sexuality, and gender - and what it is like when you still make space for yourself to be all of who you are. We all want to thank the listeners who took the time and effort to send us their stories. We also want to thank Joy Weber, our spritely right-hand enbie who read one of the stories submitted anonymously by a 41 yr old listener who is still healing her own soul after her very difficult coming out story. Y\u0027all. Be you. Be strong. Be safe. Be bold. You are not alone - and the more we all peel our layers of oppression away from ourselves, we make it safe for others to do the same. Rock and roll!

Hearing \u201CI\u2019m a girl\u201D from a kiddo you assumed was a boy can elicit a lot of reactions. Today we talk to two moms who heard their kids when their children told them who they really are and have chosen to raise them to affirm their respective genders. Their reactions were to believe and nurture their unique and beautiful children. That\u2019s what is happening in families across the world - and in America, a whooooole chunk of the country is actively trying to erase these kids (and their adult counterparts!) with anti-trans legislation. We can\u2019t stand by while old white men chat in state halls about who gets to pee where when our kids\u2019 very lives are on the line. Join the unholy trinity, Lindsay, Meg, and Sarai as they learn from two parents who have joyously embraced their kids\u2019 identities, and raise them to affirm and support who their kids know they are.

Our first episode of this 4-Part Mini Series is a conversation with Kevin Garcia, author (of many things and most recently), \u201CWhat Makes You Bloom: Cultivating a Practice for Connecting with Your Divine Self.\u201D Kevin is a mystic who has discovered a path back to himself and his spirituality after a lifetime of Evangelical gay-shaming\u2026nay, gay-annihilating\u2026 doctrine and practice. Luckily, the Vengeful Evangelical God\u2122\uFE0F doesn\u2019t have a monopoly on spirituality. Kevin, like your fab three faves (Lindsay, Meg, and Sarai), has been able to carve a beautiful spiritual life out for himself - and he helps others do the same with his work today.

Oh! And you can find episodes on both podcasts, a true crossover series! We\u0027re calling the series Too Many Cults, inspired by the video Too Many Cooks , which you should go watch! In this episode, we talk about how Bill Gothard\u2019s teachings of the Institute of Basic Life Principles (IBLP) are incredibly similar to mainstream evangelicalism and the Focus on the Family we all grew up with. Bill Gothard and Dr. Dobson were incredibly similar and created very similar dysfunctional family cultures (the latter just had fewer kids).

Get ready to think again: it\u0027s ok to want sex (contrary to popular DC Talk lyrics). Join your triumphant trio as they talk with Dr. Laura Anderson about the literal pain and trauma that purity culture leaves in its wake. Did you, for instance, know that sex is supposed to feel good????? And that feeling good includes not having pain? And what about that interesting \u0022you\u0027re not married yet so shut that sexual anything down ASAP\u0022 to \u0022you\u0027re married now, you gotta let that P into your V full force, or you\u0027re bad\u0022 transition? That\u0027s fun! No? It\u0027s terrible? OK, you\u0027re not wrong. Long story short here? Purity culture is a disaster for all the people it has harmed, continues to harm today, and will continue to harm well into the future - unless....hear me out...unless, we refuse to let sexual repression ruin our experience of being human. Join us and learn how a few chaste women entered their permanent slut era, or at least have found some nice ways to reach orgasm. And that\u0027s worth some investment of your time and energy.

It\u0027s an episode about feminism and motherhood and all of the fun messages we were taught about being a Good Christian Girl\u2122! In this episode we get into all the nitty gritty of what it means to identify as a woman in The United States of Evangelical America. Here are just a few of the things we cover: -The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) -Concerned Women for America and the work of Phyllis Schlafly (spoiler: she\u0027s not in favor of equal rights for women! Not great!) -The (very few) positive female role models that exist in the Bible (and what was so wrong with Vashti anyway? And Jezebel got a bad rap!) -SPAGHETTI STRAPS AND THE PROBLEM OF SHOWING TOO MUCH SEXY SHOULDER -The mixed messages about what it meant to be a woman in Evangelical Christianity -Passing the Bechdel Test in your own damn IG bio -How Mothers are treated like garbage in this country. Paid maternity leave and free healthcare for all, plz. -The church\u2019s insistence on giving women carnations on Mother\u2019s Day. WHY? -How it\u2019s none of your business if people are going to have a baby or not! (Lookin\u2019 at you, Vanessa Lachey) -You can be anything and do anyone! You can change your name or your gender! You don\u2019t have to take your husband\u2019s name! -Motherhood is not the highest and only calling for women. It is a choice and we support your choice to be or not to be a mother. Period. -Motherhood is a gift and also a pain in the ass. Happy Mother\u2019s Day, call your senators, and support the Equal Rights Amendment. The end.

Sha\u2019s mom had the kind of testimony Evangelicals went batshit crazy for back then (and still now!)\n\nSha\u2019s story about growing up black in a white Evangelical world reveals some of the deeper beliefs and White Supremacist/Christian Nationalist leanings that have been with the American Evangelical church from\u2026probably the beginning, let\u2019s be real. Join Lindsay, Meg, and Sarai as they listen and discover a long-suppressed reality - when people are not able to be themselves, where belonging is conditional to how one looks, acts, talks, and moves through the world - including the color of their skin (sorry, D.C. Talk - being colorblind isn\u2019t a thing and it\u2019s actually racist, heads up!)\u2026.well, it doesn\u2019t do anybody any good to continue to allow that system to flourish and persist. Let\u2019s confront some of the uglier sides of who we were as Evangelical white kids (say Lindsay, Meg, and Sarai) and learn from people who had a much more alienating and disempowering experience than we did. Which\u2026if you\u2019ve listened to even 10 minutes of a single episode of Holy Ghosting, you realize is saying A LOT.",

      "description": "Growing up in American Christianity in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s meant we were smack dab in the height of Dobson Domination. That is, Dr. James Dobson and his Focus on the Family ubiquity in the realm of parenting and child rearing advice, children\u2019s entertainment (and, behind the scenes, lobbying and more exciting political dealings)\u2026 If your parents \u201Cdared to discipline\u201D their \u201Cstrong-willed children\u201D the Dobson way, you probably got a good amount of spanking, control, and fear in your childhood. Parents were told that breaking the spirit of a child would ensure they would become good little Christians and (just as or more importantly) good little Republicans. Amazingly, many of us didn\u2019t end up that way - and the Boomers who listened to Focus on the Family\u2019s terrible advice haven\u2019t learned how to apologize for their behavior. And some of them are just left to wonder why their children have betrayed them. So\u2026what now??? How do we learn to parent our children differently? How do we raise kids who become emotionally mature and intelligent? Join the conversation and hear how a handful of your fave middle-aged mom friends have been trying their hand at it so far.

Dr. Amy Ferrell \u0022I hope for everyone\u0027s sake that if there is any kind of awakening that it is to the truths of this world. Especially the truth of our complicity in harm, like racism, patriarchy, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, Christian exceptionalism (\u0022We\u0027re the good and right ones\u0022), saviorism, martyrdom, emotional repression, binaries, paradigms of control using manipulation, coercion, intimidation, and punishment, and I could go on. Hoping we all can wake up and see through the illusions of the world and of us.\u0022 Revival is never said in the New Testament, but 2 Chronicles 7:14 is used to justify \u0022healing the land\u0022 of America from things Christians don\u0027t like.

There\u2019s only one thing that will end a marriage in God\u2019s eyes\u2026ADULTERY. But even then, sometimes it\u2019s best to forgive (the man) and stay married! We\u2019re all big fans of personal choice over here, even if you signed a legal (gasp!) document one time when you were 20 (oh, was that just Meg?!) you don\u2019t HAVE to stay in a relationship you don\u2019t like (you don\u2019t even have to say your reason).

Having boobs, terrible! Even thinking about or knowing anybody who drank any kind of alcohol?? NO! And especially\u2026DRUGS. Then again, in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, drugs were bad for everyone, because Nancy Reagan said so. This season is all about Taboos! In this episode, we delve into the realm of substances and how we\u2019ve learned where, when, and how substances harm or help us. \u201CBefore we can ask an addict to say no to drugs we have to give them something to say yes to.\u201D Gabor Mat\u00E9, MD In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts This Naked Mind by Annie Grace Support this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/holy-ghosting/exclusive-content Advertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brands Privacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",

HBO Max\u0027s docu-series \u0022Savior Complex\u0022 is a three part mini documentary series and in this episode we unravel the disturbing ascent of Renee Bach. At just 19, Bach, with no medical training, felt \u0022a heart for Africa\u0022 and believed she was called by God. What began as a feeding program alarmingly transformed into an unlicensed medical clinic, with Renee performing medical procedures on malnourished children, leading to catastrophic outcomes.\n\uD83D\uDEA8 Viewer Discretion Advised: This episode is not for the faint of heart. Prepare for a discussion that spans ill and malnourished children, infant and child mortality, the glaring issue of white supremacy, and the deeply problematic Laurie Bach (Renee\u2019s mom, homeschool teacher and head of the Serving His Children board of directors).\n\uD83D\uDD0D Why Watch?:\nCritical Analysis: We provide a critical review of the first and part of the second episode of \u0022Savior Complex,\u0022 sparing you the horror and giving you the essentials.\nHard Conversations: This story is a crucial conversation starter about white saviorism, unqualified missions in Africa, and the dire consequences of unchecked privilege.\nUpcoming Review: Stay tuned for Part 2 of our review, where we continue to dissect this complex story and its implications.\n\uD83D\uDCAC Join the Conversation: After watching, we invite you to share your thoughts, reactions, and insights in the comments below.

      "description": "In this very special episode of Holy Ghosting, we got to chat with everyone\u2019s favorite rogue CCM songwriter, Derek Webb of Caedmon\u2019s Call! If you were an evangelical Christian in the 90\u2019s/2000\u2019s, you know who we\u2019re talkin about. Caedmon\u2019s Call was THE band of youth groups and Bible colleges. And as it turns out, Derek is quite literally from a Long Line of Leavers (SEE WHAT WE DID THERE?!) and after a long and successful career in the Christian music industry, he decided to leave Christianity entirely. He\u2019s made a lot of music about his faith journey, and has been refreshingly open and honest along the way. p.s. Derek is on tour currently, debuting songs from his soon-to-be released album, The Jesus Hypothesis. Tickets and info at derekwebb.com That said, we were super excited to sit down and chat with Derek about alllllllllll the things. We talked about his CCM days, his \u201Cfall from grace\u201D, deconversion, solo career, and all that fun stuff! (We also heard a little from his adorable pup, Etta.) We got into all the nitty gritty of evangelical Christianity and were floored by his kind and graceful way of speaking about the messiness of faith and doubt and everything in between. And we talked about David Bazan (because if you\u2019re talkin about deconstruction, it always comes back to Bazan). Just trust us when we say we had the best conversation with Derek and he made us feel a part of something bigger and it made us feel thankful for YOU (our Ghosties!) and this rad community we\u2019re building. Now stop reading and go listen to the interview!

      "description": "As Evangelical children in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, we had plenty of Big Terrible Things to fear. Satanic Panic was in full swing, stranger danger lurked in every darkened doorway, and America\u2019s Most Wanted sailed into our living rooms on the reg. One of the most fearful things, of course, was the rise of Environmentalism. (BUT WHY?!) Seriously, though, does anybody know why Evangelicals - people who believe God literally created the world and everything it and who believe the earth is a gift from God above - also hate environmentalism? Deny climate change? Fight for industry over the health of the earth? (All God\u2019s creatures great and small, unless you\u2019re the Spotted Owl, then fuck you!) The cognitive dissonance is astounding. So, if you, like this unanimous trio of co-hosts, were not allowed to watch Fern Gully, lest your fertile young mind absorb the poison of the message to protect the earth, listen in as we get into the nitty gritty of Christians and the Environmental Agenda. If, on the other hand, you\u2019re reading this description and thinking it makes literally no sense - you\u2019re not wrong. Join the club and still listen, because if nothing else, this will entertain you for a little while. This season, Holy Ghosting is focusing on the philosophies, activities, existences, and concepts that were taboo in our Evangelical experience. Anything and everything from fat bodies, naked bodies, LGBTQIA\u0026#43; bodies and humans\u2026we\u2019re gonna opine and weep and laugh our way through it all. If you\u2019re into that sort of thing, you might want to become one of our besties and become a Holy Ghostie at Patreon.com/holyghosting Don\u2019t forget to subscribe so you don\u2019t miss a single episode this season! What\u2019s more fun than Taboo? Guesstures? NO. Taboo is the best group game, end of discussion.

And if that weren\u2019t enough sharing for one day, we decided to share our Testimonies and catch each other up on our walks, because that\u2019s what fellowship is, we supposed. So if you\u2019ve ever wondered how we went from Good Girls to whatever we are now, this is the episode for you. Each of us had similar beginnings, but we each had a Very Specific Journey through and out of Evangelical Christianity. Pull some threads with us as we share pieces of our deconstruction and reconstruction stories. Ever wondered how many sidebars Sarai could stick in one episode, find out now! Who among us majored in Bible? What the heck happened with these perfectly suitable evangelical Good Girls? Listen, enjoy, and then go ahead and work out your own Salvation, fear and trembling optional.

For evangelical kids, the gifts kept giving all year long, because ours were\u2026spiritual. Join Lindsay, Meg, and Sarai as they troll through their past and reanimate their spiritual ghosts, we mean gifts. Remember words normals never use (exhortation, anyone??), join us as we talk through the controversy surrounding tongues (with and without interpretation, nerds), and rediscover one key gift all three of us share: Discernment. (We will wait for your collective gasp!) Ever wonder what spiritual gifts were all about? Even if you don\u2019t believe the stuff you were raised with, what can we do with this information? Turns out Discernment is a pretty rad signifier of having intuition and listening to it. And, the gift of Administration leads a kid to just absolutely love paperwork and be the boss-betch of the world. And of course, Hospitality makes all potlucks possible - and science says nobody can survive without being forced to eat room temperature green bean casserole at least once. Plus! Bonus: Stay tuned next week for a special release (Our Spiritual Gift to you, dear Ghostie), as we release behind the scenes content of the three of us middle aged mom friends reconstructing our top five spiritual gifts, and deconstructing the leftover shreds of pain and shame and doubt and turning them to wailing laughter and hopefully, something useful we can all still take from our experience.

Don\u2019t worry, the entire episode isn\u2019t about premarital sexual things\u2026but most of it is. So, content warning for those of you who want to be the ones to tell your teens that self-pleasure is good and to worry more about giving consent and getting consent than crossing an imaginary purity boundary imposed by people that were obsessed with our virginity. But that isn\u2019t the only thing these Good Christian Girls\u00AE, Lindsay, Meg, and Sarai, rebelled against. This week we\u2019re gossiping about our younger selves and revealing the secrets we thought would stay in our journals until we died, or until we burned them in a cleansing ritual (you guess if it\u2019ll be the holy kind or the witchy kind). We want to hear your stories of rebellion, too. How did you rebuke the church elders or reply to a bat-shit-crazy interpretation of scripture or call out the youth pastor? Send us your stories and we\u2019ll share them with our community. We\u2019re louder together and they can\u2019t shut us ALL up. Oh. And for the faithful reader and listener...there\u0027s a bonus ending if your loyalty and patience are never-ending. Hint: If you\u0027re a Marvel fan, you know to wait.

If you \u201Csearch engine\u201D * the term \u201CWhat should I NEVER talk about?\u201D you\u2019ll get a lot of lists. Most of those lists include sex, death, money, and especially religion and politics. Unfortunately, for those consumed with propriety, this podcast pretty much covers all of them at one point or another. In this episode, join your favorite throuple, Lindsay, Meg, and Sarai, to learn about how their Evangelical upbringing informed (or misinformed, more accurately) the shape of their political lives and choices. From being raised on a steady diet of Rush Limbaugh to using Christian Voter Guides -- codename: \u201Chow to be a Republican no matter how far it leads you from your supposed \u2018biblical worldview\u2019 -- to how the three of them have unraveled themselves from the entanglement of the church and the right-wing in America. Important sidebars and rabbit** trails this episode include: health care is a human right, Oregon-specific political rants, and the strange affection Lindsay and Sarai both harbor toward the fearfully departed Limbaugh, PLUS a surprise worship song that is sure to tug at your heartstrings. It was written and performed by Kermit The Frog, originally. Want to chat about fun (read: terrible) things like Christian Nationalism (aka White Supremacy and Colonialist Idealism) and wonderful things (read: actually wonderful) like voting by mail?

This episode contains a few campfire horror stories about strange events and spooky shit that happened in our youths. Content warning includes: demon possession, youth pastors grooming\u2026well, youth, animal death (in a DEEPLY disturbing way), and, if you love Sarai\u2019s conspiracy theories, there\u2019s a real humdinger in this episode. For the bravest among us who can wade these dark and murky waters, carry on. As Good Christian Girls\u00AE, Lindsay, Meg, and Sarai grew up in the shadow of the Satanic Panic, which made Halloween a ghastly time for Evangelicals. To create a safe haven from the ghosts and witches and satan worshippers (can we stop for a moment and appreciate that this was a THING we all learned??? That satan worshippers are marauding about your suburbs and sacrificing stray cats??)\u2026ahem, the safe haven, that is, was one that was nestled inside the holy walls of a church. Harvest Parties! (Or Harvest Festivals! If you were extra). Wind your way through the emerging Halloween appreciation your 40-Something Mom Friends are experiencing in their own special ways. And then?? Then! Get on the sosh meeds and tell us your favorite Evangelical childhood antics - anybody dress up like Larry the Cucumber? We need to know, and we need to see the photographic evidence, PLEASE!

When we met Dr. Melissa Bird and heard about her work as a Christian witch, we had to know more.

If you were an evangelical in your coming of age period at the turn of the millennium, you or several of your close God-fearing friends took a mission trip (or dozens). Mission trips were like\u2026I guess a wandering train of [Jesus] Freaks setting up shop in one nation or another. Instead of fortune tellers, strongmen, and bearded ladies, mission trips brought a gimmicky way to \u201Cspread the gospel\u201D. Anyhoo, these trips were SO emo. We all got on board a bus or a plane or some kid\u2019s mom\u2019s minivan and entered the mission field. Once there, we\u2019d build (and/or rebuild - allegedly) a playground or a church or an orphanage, or dress up like mimes, or stand on actual soapboxes on street corners - all to shout about the wonderful plan Jesus has for your life. Then, Mission Accomplished, we would leave enriched with culture, travel, and the uncanny feeling that perhaps this trip was for us all along. We\u2019d reflect, shocked, that maybe we learned more from the people we came to help than we ever had to teach them. White saviors start early. Lindsay, Meg, and Sarai talk about their experiences going to exotic places (including Oklahoma!!), spreading the gospel like a linen duvet cover (shout out to our 40-ish mom friends!). Cringe your way through the past and remember that oh, so fresh feeling of saving souls and taking names.

      "description": "Chances are if you were assigned the tender feminine gender at your evangelical birth, well, ya probably have a lot of baggage and issues that stem from questionable portrayals of women in the Bible. Among the vagina-laden humans celebrated in the canon, we have everyone from a literal teenager, whose virginity inspired millennia of penis-havers to idolize purity, to the wily, vengeful Judge Deborah, who straight up murdered a Philistine with a wicked tent peg through the temple. Pretty badass, tbh. But greatest among these female role models, as few and scattered they were amid the many, many Jezebel-style characters (by the way, \u201Ceaten by dogs\u201D is my preferred way to describe a death)\u2026there stood alone a perfect prototype of the ideal wife. The Proverbs 31 Woman. This strong, gluten-free woman (she eats not the bread of idleness), stays awake all damn night working on her embroideries and preserves, dresses her children in scarlet, herself in purple and linens, and gets busy making food, importing and exporting goods, feeding the poor, feeding her lovin\u2019 man/king, and fully celebrated by all excellence at everything. She surpasses all other women with her tireless, industrious, wise work ethic. But when does she get to take a damn nap? Join your new favorite heretics as they discuss what The Proverbs 31 Woman meant to them, why 3/3rds of them *still* have a hard time letting their lamp go out by night, and where and how we might like to grow in perhaps less hurried and productive ways. Welcome to radical uselessness. And yeah, you can wear all the scarlet and purple and strength and dignity you can handle - no shame in that. Just know that it\u2019s good to take a beat sometimes and even better to remember this P 31 woman (as I\u2019ve seen her referred to on her most devoted fan websites) - she was never a real person at all. What if we could become our own heroes instead of living up to an impossible idea? What if we got to enjoy the fruit of our labor too? Let\u2019s try it. After we take a wee nap.

      "description": "In the harrowing days of puberty, evangelical young women and girls were foisted into a shame spiral that kept them tame and readily codependent for\u2026maybe their entire lives. Their every move governed by the grave understanding that it was their job to \u201Cnot cause your brother to stumble,\u201D they walked about with hunched shoulders, tucked their butts, and generally shut their every desire or bodily sensation DOWN, and fast. They were especially horrified by their own breasticles, as they seemed to cause their \u201Cbrothers\u201D to stumble despite their best efforts to wear Modest Is Hottest fashion (read: not fashion). Join Lindsay, Meg, and Sarai - three cisgendered ladies whose boobs have haunted them their entire post-pubescent lives - as they uncover the real meaning behind the context of that stupid \u201Cbrothers stumbling\u201D BS, and reckon with the aftermath of blaming oneself for literally everybody else\u2019s problems and working their lifelong butts off to appease and make others feel more comfortable in their presence. If you\u2019re a former church kid who grew up when Modest really was Hottest, whether cis, trans, queer, or straight, you\u2019ll recognize these damaging ideas. Hopefully, as these three boob-havers discuss their experiences with the oppression and abuse grooming inherent in Purity Culture, you might be able to unwind a little bit of your own bosom-or non-bosom related woes. Good news, though: knowing is half the battle, and\u2026half is pretty good progress, tbh.

      "description": "What does one do with the conundrum of abortion? When Lindsay, Meg, and Sarai were growing up, the Evangelical Christian stance on abortion was never, ever, no way, no how. The church made specious (and racist, xenophobic, peri-holocaust denying or at best minimizing) arguments meant to tug at the heartstrings of nice, Christian, white ladies. Present-day: billboards litter the interstates of America, showing bright-eyed (almost exclusively white) babies with ominous words like \u201Cabortion stops a beating heart\u201D emblazoned across their tidily diapered butts; pro-choice and pro-life people don\u2019t even speak the same language much less know how to fight in the same battle; and the powers that be have successfully edged Roe v Wade toward the dustbin of history. Enter some deconstructing, young former Evangelicals (one of whom shamefully admitted she voted for George W. Bush\u2026TWICE) and they start to ask questions about this once untouchable medical procedure. Your 40-ish mom friends talk through the taboo tornado of purity culture (patriarchy), Nice Christian White Ladies (white supremacy), and hit action movies from bygone decades, oh and abortion...all while we realize it was never really about the babies\u2026and Evangelicals didn\u2019t give any toots about abortion until, like, a year or two before our hosts were all born. How would we have known when we were standing on the streets in our respective hometowns begging people to just realize that life begins at conception (but where does conception begin? Oh\u2026I think we\u2019re in an inception now)\u2026anyway\u2026give it a listen! And join the conversation with us at HolyGhosting.com TikTok@holyghosting Instagram \u0026 Twitter @holyghostingpod If you or someone you know needs abortion healthcare call the NAF Hotline at 1-800-772-9100 for help and to learn about safe options for ending a pregnancy.

      "description": "Here we are, June of 2022. Welcome summer, and farewell Mental Health Awareness Month (May!). But if we go back in time, just a little bit, to remember the good old days of the freewheeling 1980\u2019s - when Evangelical churches and politicians were in the golden age of knitting together the interests of church and state (so cute!)\u2026people were too busy to talk about mental health (at least not at church)\u2026even though Mental Health Awareness Month started WAY BACK in 1949 - oh, we\u2019ve had Mental Health issues all along as humans? No Way! In this inaugural episode of Holy Ghosting, you\u2019ll meet Lindsay, Meg, and Sarai - a bunch of former church girls who came of age in 80s and 90s American Evangelicalism. With a veritable host of mental health diagnoses between them, you\u2019ll learn more than you ever thought you\u2019d want to know about their own journeys through mental health by way of the church, and you might find echoes of your own experience if you were once a church kid too. We cover everything from the laying on of hands, the shame of mental health issues, using the Bible as therapy (instead of therapy because that wasn\u2019t a thing we ever considered doing), and everything from visual hallucinations to the revolutionary idea that maybe, just maybe, telling other people the truth about our own mental wellbeing can help everybody be a little safer and a little better. If you or someone you know needs mental health support: text BRAVE to the Crisis Text Line at 741741 A trained crisis counselor will receive it and respond within minutes. Then, the crisis counselor will help you de-escalate your situation and connect you to help locally.
