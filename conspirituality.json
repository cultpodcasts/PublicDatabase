      "description": "Tech billionaire Peter Thiel is no cuck philanthropist. The co-founder of Palantir is leading his company at the bleeding edge of mass surveillance, facial recognition, predictive policing, and AI-assisted warfare. He also fancies himself a political player, responsible for funding his protege, JD Vance, to a heartbeat away from the presidency. Considering this CV, the announcement that Thiel would give a series of four lectures on the AntiChrist was puzzling.\u00A0\n\nWhy would a tech-bro with a notoriously awkward and inarticulate speaking style hold forth on religious prophecy? Or would this be a coming out party, where he would finally confirm his alliance with Satan?

Nathan shares the roots of his concept of yallidarity\u2014solidarity rooted in labor, joy, food, music, and taking care of one another.\n\nThey discuss the myths and realities of Appalachia, the erasure of labor history, and the dangers of \u201Cbootstrap\u201D individualism. Nathan tells about his upbringing in fringe charismatic churches, the connections between charismatic Christianity and Trump-style politics, and how faith traditions can nurture resilience\u2014or be co-opted by empire.\n\nThey dig into Nathan\u2019s viral \u201CHillbilly Hymn\u201D: why the cops disappear when Jesus returns, why kinship always beats bootstraps, and how to imagine an abolitionist future that doesn\u0027t erase culture but reorients it toward joy, justice, and care.All theme music by the amazing www.kalliemarie.com.\n\nShow Notes\n\nEverything Nathan Evans Fox\n\nGaza Sumud flotilla: How Israel breaks international maritime law | Israel-Palestine conflict News | Al Jazeera\n\nGaza-bound flotilla rejects Israeli claims of Hamas funding | Euronews\n\nContact Restored with Global Sumud Flotilla after Israeli Interference - Palestine Chronicle\n\nThe Sabbath Year and the Year of Jubilee\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "In this first installment of Antifascist Christianity: Black Jesus, Matthew revisits Dietrich Bonhoeffer\u2019s journey from the theological classrooms of Berlin to the Black churches of Harlem \u2014 where he encountered a Jesus entirely unlike the imperial figure of his upbringing. Bonhoeffer arrived in New York a servant of white European Christendom, and left transformed by the radical, suffering, and liberatory presence of Black Jesus.\n\nMatthew connects Bonhoeffer\u2019s awakening to today\u2019s spectacle of white nationalism in worship \u2014 from the triumphalist religion on display at Charlie Kirk\u2019s memorial to the enduring cultural power of \u201Cwhite Jesus\u201D as theology for empire. Drawing on Reggie Williams\u2019s Bonhoeffer\u2019s Black Jesus, Cedric Robinson\u2019s Black Marxism, and Jeanelle Hope and Bill Mullen\u2019s The Black Antifascist Tradition, the episode traces how colonialism created a Christ built to bless domination, and how the Black church reclaimed him through solidarity, suffering, and resistance.\n\nThe contrast between the fortress hymn A Mighty Fortress Is Our God and the spiritual Were You There becomes the turning point in Bonhoeffer\u2019s faith \u2014 from triumph to trembling, from power to empathy.\n\nPart 2, out Monday on Patreon, explores how liberal Christianity tried to stand between these poles, and why it failed.\n\nShow Notes\n\nHope, Jeanelle K., and Bill V.

      "description": "Matthew begins a two-part exploration of Simone Weil\u2014French philosopher, mystic, and antifascist activist\u2014through the lens of autism, embodiment, and political courage. Following the earlier Antifascist Christianity Woodshed series on Dietrich Bonhoeffer, this installment positions Weil as a kind of spiritual auntie to Greta Thunberg, whose uncompromising honesty, rooted in autistic perception, continues to disrupt fascist, capitalist, and liberal narrative.\n\nMatthew traces Weil\u2019s journey from childhood acts of solidarity, like giving up sugar during WW1, to her immersion in factory labor, revolutionary syndicalism, and frontline service in the Spanish Civil War. Weil\u2019s refusal of privilege and their lifelong impulse to take on suffering emerge as core features of both her philosophy and her autistic experience. They also stood up to Leon Trotsky, calling out Soviet authoritarianism long before its collapse.\n\nWeil can be understood not only through the posthumous notebooks and essays that editors and institutions reshaped into seventeen volumes, but through the lived reality of their embodied resistance. Their ideas remain striking: the notion of attention as the rarest form of generosity; the insistence that obligations come before rights; the practice of \u201Cdecreation\u201D as a release of ego in the service of love; and the \u201Cneed for roots\u201D as an antifascist alternative to blood-and-soil nationalism.\n\nPart 2 of this series drops Monday on Patreon, where Matthew goes deeper into Weil\u2019s autistic traits, their spiritual life, and how their philosophy continues to confront liberalism and fascism alike.\n\nSupport us on Patreon to access Part 2 and the full Antifascist Woodshed series.\n\nShow NotesColes, Robert.

Religion is merely an inflaming of a fundamentalist minority based on political injustices.\n\nWhat about the Soviet Union? The history of political Islam and massive Muslim caliphates that ruled for nearly 1,300 years? The intractable sectarian conflicts and the multiple internal ideologies vying for control over the Middle East?\n\nThere may be no easy answers, but perhaps engaging with these different perspectives can allow us to name some of the many factors that got us to 9/11 and the seemingly unsolvable dilemmas of our world today.\n\nShow Notes\n\nPopular Mechanics on 911 conspiracies\n\nNoam Chomsky on 911 conspiracies\n\nPilger on Project for A New American Century\n\nNYT 2023 Piece on the Reasons for Iraq War\n\nSaddam\u2019s Ruthless Purge\n\nCNN on Kabul attitudes after US Invasion\n\nPolling of Iraqis\n\nMahmood Mamdani Good Muslim, Bad Muslim Interview\n\nHuman Rights Watch on Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan\n\nTaimur Rahman\u2019s Red Star History of Political Islam Lectures\nLearn more about your ad choices.

But how did comedy become so unfunny, so politically toxic?\u00A0\n\nFrom his hideout in a remote mountain cabin, anonymous video collage artist and essayist The Elephant Graveyard has finally cracked the code. According to him, Joe Rogan has created a doomsday death cult that feeds the dad-shaped hole in the hearts of its followers. In this allegory, his Comedy Mothership theater in Austin is like the alien spacecraft zooming in from behind the Hale Bop comet to take the Heaven\u0027s Gate group suicide victims home, freed from their earth-suits.\u00A0\n\nAnd it turns out tech oligarchs Peter Thiel and Elon Musk are really behind it all.\n\nShow Notes\n\nVile Grifters Are Taking Over Establishment Media\n\nHow Comedy Was Destroyed by an Anti-Reality Doomsday Cult\nLearn more about your ad choices.

The alleged shooter is still at large, but his social media footprint shows anti-vaccine, COVID-contrarian, and even QAnon-aligned beliefs, as well as a long history of violent threats against police. Julian talks to journalists Ariel Bogle and Cam Wilson, co-authors of an excellent new book, Conspiracy Nation: Exposing The Dangerous World of Australian Conspiracy Theories. As with everywhere else in the world, the pandemic poured gasoline on what would become a familiar set of incendiary false beliefs\u2014but the sociopolitical and historical context down under has its own unique details. The conversation spans claims of government false-flag operations, real legacies of institutional abuse, and Australia\u2019s most famous conspiracy export and celebrity chef, Pete Evans.

He came to the US believing in the white Jesus of European empire, but left enthralled by the Black Jesus of the oppressed. Back in Germany, he played 78s of spirituals and gospel tunes for the students of his illegal seminaries as he and other members of the Confessing Church issued some of the earliest formal rebukes to the Reich. And then he joined a plot to assassinate Hitler.

      "description": "Well, I seem to always be inspired by the person who is considered marginal. Firstly, their spirit of survival, their resilience, their lack of self-pity, the ability usually to laugh in the face of having nothing and to create a kind of sense of flamboyance and life at any cost, despite having you know no resources of any kind that are visible. That\u0027s what inspires me and I think in making portraits of the so-called outsiders, I\u0027m also then allowed to question what is that society that deems us an outsider?\n\n\u2014 Mira Nair on BBC \u201CMasterpiece\u201D, 11/29/04\n\nWhen official America speaks of good and bad Muslims, we must not think that they are speaking of the attitude of Muslims to Islam.

      "description": "On the horizon: a new liberal-center manosphere, yearning to reach out to the young men poached by Trumpism, but offering what, exactly?\u00A0\n\nProfessor Scott Galloway and Anthony Scaramucci are earnest and charming in their way, and they have Trump\u2019s number. But with their new project, Lost Boys podcast, they\u2019re stuck in a paradox. They know enough to admit that the capitalist logic that made them both multi-millionaires is fickle, cruel, and misogynist. They know it\u2019s beating up everyone, including young men. But they can\u2019t imagine any other way of organizing society. So what do they offer? Nostalgia for the 1980s, self-help tips.\n\nIn this two-part series, Matthew looks at why the Lost Boys project is deceptively attractive. Liberal, libertarian, or even reactionary parenting can affect an earnest emotional bond through overtones of spiritual honesty. But all the empathy is impotent when it defaults into an apologetics for the very systems that make us suffer.\u00A0\n\nPart One looks at the overall liberal manosphere politics of Lost Boys, including the evidentiary claims put forward by their premier guest Richard Reeves, who Galloway calls his \u201CYoda\u201D on the subject of how men are doing these days.\n\nPart Two (drops Monday on Patreon) goes into a granular reading of Episode 7 of Lost Boys, where the guest is Deirdre Scaramucci, Anthony\u2019s partner. Together, the trio discloses a ton about their ambivalent GenX childhoods and their current parenting experience, including how they rationalize losing emotional control.\n\nShow Notes\n\nLost Boys - Podcast\u00A0\n\nAnthony Scaramucci Called Me to Unload About White House Leakers, Reince Priebus, and Steve Bannon | The New Yorker\u00A0\n\nPolitics for men - by Richard V Reeves\n\nRichard Reeves? : r/AskFeminists\n\nRight Diagnosis, Wrong Prescription: Richard Reeves\u0027 Of Boys and Men | Institute for Family Studies\n\nCollapse Feminism by Alice Cappelle | Penguin Random House Canada\u00A0\n\nCommunism | David Graeber\nLearn more about your ad choices.

We\u2019ve spent years covering the hard and soft eugenics that inform so many physical and spiritual practices, and how the notion of an ideal self persists and, as we get into today, grown in the online world.\u00A0\n\nJust as shaming and skewed body perceptions proliferate in the comments sections and fitfluencer podcast world, so have opportunities for meaningful conversations. One such venue is the wildly popular debate and discussion shows hosted by Jubilee Media. They\u2019ve somehow managed to tow the line between heartfelt sharing and outright clickbait, for better and worse. \n\nWe look at a few recent episodes that deal directly with body image issues, from being jacked and bro\u2019d up to the challenges of obesity and eating disorders, and discuss how Jubilee is walking such a precarious tightrope.\n\nShow Notes\n\nAnorexia vs Obese | Middle Ground\n\nIs Being Fat A Choice?

Which of course makes him the target of conspiracy-mongers and right-wing propagandists, as well establishment Democrats and supporters of Israel. \n\nAs masked ICE thugs, cynical SCOTUS enablers, movie-villain oligarchs, and MAGA cult ghouls steadily dismantle democracy we\u0027ll discuss the Mamdani Effect.

Roger Hinkins claimed to be inhabited by another consciousness that he called \u201CJohn the Beloved\u201D and the \u201CMystical Traveller,\u201D which taught the secrets of out-of-body experiences. As he copied those teachings from elsewhere, his lies eventually caught up with him. But he told his loyal followers that critics and defectors were infected with an infectious demonic energy called \u201CThe Red Monk.\u201D For this self-contained installment of his popular Roots of Conspirituality series, Julian tells the fascinating story the Movement for Spiritual Inner Awareness, and how its leader fooled devotees into thinking he was clairvoyant.

While some people remained surprisingly relevant, most were confined to, at best, appearing at VFWs and regional summer festivals in parking lots or, tragically, gripped by an addiction and dreams of a better time that they couldn\u2019t make last.\u00A0\n\nTwo years ago this month our book, Conspirituality, was published. We called one section Rogue\u2019s Gallery to highlight a range of figures we\u2019ve covered on the podcast. One of those chapters was dedicated to a man named Robert F Kennedy, Jr\u2014don\u2019t say we didn\u2019t warn you. How about the other nine?\n\nIn our own version of \u201CWhere Are They Now,\u201D we\u2019re going to turn back the clock and revisit those other nine chapters. We\u2019ll do it over three episodes in the coming weeks. This week, we begin with famed women\u2019s health expert turned harp-playing conspiracy peddler, Christiane Northrup; self-proclaimed philosopher king, Charles Eisenstein; and former model turned middling new age filmmaker turned anti-vax documentarian Mikki Willis.\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "You may have grown up with the term \u201Cnonviolence\u201D shining like a pole star over every discussion of how we accomplish socio-political change. But what does it really mean? And who defines violence for that matter\u2014beyond the police, the courts, and others in power?\n\nToday, the theory of non-violence has grown beyond its Gandhian, spiritual aspiration roots, while retaining an irrational faith and offering a distorted view of resistance history. It is now a think-tank-approved, purportedly evidence-based method that guarantees movement success.\u00A0\n\nThat reasoning comes from the pioneering scholarship of the pacifist Gene Sharp in the 1960s, and his inheritors in strategic nonviolence discourse, Erica Chenoweth and Maria Stephan. They argue that Gandhi\u2019s sacred ideal of satyagraha also happens to be the only successful pathway to lasting change\u2014and they have the data to prove it.\u00A0\n\nBut do they? Nope. Matthew\u2019s guest today persuasively shows that the movements we think of as \u201Cnonviolent\u201D never really are. Why don\u2019t we know this? Through a tangle of academic malpractice, spiritual bypassing, liberal wish fulfillment, and erasing anticolonial voices. Oh, and Gene Sharp also got a lot of funding from the Department of Defense.\n\nBenjamin S. Case is a retired professional Muaythai fighter, an organizer, educator, and writer. He is a researcher at the Center for Work and Democracy and a fellow at the Resistance Studies Initiative.\u00A0\n\nShow Notes\n\nStreet Rebellion: Resistance Beyond Violence and Nonviolence | Case\n\nWhy Civil Resistance Works | Columbia University Press\u00A0\n\nWhy Not Riot?

No longer would food be dyed and oils be made of seeds. Everyone would get free gym memberships. America\u2019s chronic disease epidemic would end overnight, as he\u2019s repeatedly claimed.\u00A0\n\nThen Mr Kennedy goes to Washington only to declare that antisemitism is a public health crisis? And to say that the MMR vaccine is the most effective way to prevent measles? How could he say such a thing when, as Mikki Willis recently claimed, this \u201Cversion\u201D of measles is a bioweapon designed to infect the Mennonite population?\u00A0\n\nThis week we look way too deeply into Candace Owens\u2019s recent episodes about the blackmailing of RFK Jr, a story that quickly spread its tentacles into the microphones of a number of contrarian right-wing podcasters. We\u2019ll give you the lowdown on the story and how, like a children\u2019s game of telephone, it repeatedly got distorted and reframed with every mind it touched. \n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

For seven years, she traveled to \u201Cboxes\u201D around the world while committing herself to her local Brooklyn box. What she uncovered was a rabid fan base that deeply values community and a business model that offers a refreshing response to unfettered capitalism\u2014as well as the misogyny, racism, and militarized Christian themes that inform this beloved and despised fitness regimen.

They argue that Democrat-run cities and states have suffered self-inflicted wounds that are causing a mass exodus to red states, where life is simply more affordable. To stop the bleeding, Dems need to take action on a bold new vision that cuts through red tape to improve people\u2019s lives and address the crises in housing, climate, healthcare and politics. \nBut many on the left are suspicious.

Should it be shown in Parliament? Schools? Does it tell us much about the kids it is worried about? Does it offload responsibility for misogyny and violence onto ambient internet chaos, when there are so many other causes closer to home?

      "description": "First of Matthew\u0027s two-part examination of why the hell questions of force, non-violent resistance with and without force, unarmed violence and property damage, and armed violence are so incredibly hard to talk about in a culture thick with spiritual and political bypassing. Are we capable of understanding the difference between morality and strategy?\nPart 1 focuses on philosophy and psychology while Part 2 focuses on definitions and tactics. Together, both parts will push back on conspiracism about the identities, motives, and methods\u00A0 of antifascists. Both will present slices of the rich discourse on violence and non-violence from antifascist history, including clarifying definitions of key terms. Both will open a space to think carefully about what intensities of self and community defense are both useful and tolerable in the fight against fascism.\u00A0\nPart 2 gets into the very thick weeds of how the \u201Cstrategic nonviolence\u201D research of Gene Sharp, Erica Chenoweth and Maria Stephan is framed as empirical, but may be way more about idealizing Gandhi than about facts on the ground.

Perry calls this \u201Cre-paganization,\u201D delivering an eloquent longing for a lost golden age of female subservience as Weiss nods along and smiles. It\u2019s all very heterodox. Or is it? No mention of the impacts of Project 2025, the dangerous ascendancy of Christian Nationalism, or the deadly crisis of women\u2019s health in full swing.

      "description": "\u201CYou don\u2019t get rich writing science fiction. If you want to get rich, start a religion.\u201D With those words, prolific sci-fi pulp fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard prophesied the course of his life\u2019s work. The 1950s saw the emergence of UFO- and alien channeling-based spiritual groups, as postmodern religious syncretism transformed supposedly ancient angels and demons into benevolent and/or terrifying aliens. No iteration of this fantasy has been more financially fruitful, culturally impactful, controversial, or bizarre than Hubbard\u2019s brainchild: Scientology. In the latest episode of Roots of Conspirituality, Julian digs into the fascinating backstory of this prolific author, revered as prophetic by thousands, pursued as a fraud by the IRS for decades, described as a cult leader by church escapees, and called an abusive madman by his ex-wives. Allegedly\u2026 The religion is a complex blend of self-help psychology, elaborate pseudoscience, high-demand paranoia, and alien mythology that, at its height, commanded 100,000 members\u2014and is still valued at roughly $2 billion.

Remember that horseshit, or things like it? Did you guffaw because he was obviously absurd? Did you try to reason with his stans online? Did you see him as a crank influencer, or a dangerous political figure? Did you hope his ideas would be beaten down in the marketplace of ideas?

      "description": "One of the top podcasts in the world\u2014even beating out Rogan for a few hours\u2014is popularizing a well-meaning intervention for non-speaking autistic people. Unfortunately, that intervention happens to be a proven failure, and may set autistic and disability rights discourse back by decades. Filmmaker Ky Dickson\u2019s The Telepathy Tapes podcast delves into the world of Facilitated Communication, in which non-speaking people are believed to miraculously gain access to complex written language after lives of silence. According to Dickson, non-speaking people can also gather in transdimensional spaces and channel spiritual knowledge. But there\u2019s a problem. Every controlled test shows that the messages produced through letterboards and iPads are coming from the facilitators\u2014not the non-speaking persons. In this episode, Matthew interviews experts in pseudoscience and autism, including Janyce Boynton, a former (now dissident) practitioner of Facilitated Communication who explains how seductive and promising it was to practice, but how it ultimately steals agency and dignity from the autistic client. And... this is also a story about parents dealing with crushing levels of unpaid and invisible labour. They are already doing miraculous work.

      "description": "In January, 2023, Bloomberg published an article about how tech entrepreneur turned longevity stan, Bryan Johnson, spends $2 million a year in an attempt to live forever\u2014or at least until age 200, as the goalposts shift. Then a Netflix documentary, Don\u2019t Die: The Man Who Wants to Live Forever, dropped on January 1, taking a deep dive into Johnson\u2019s quest and complex personal life. A strange thing happened along the way: Johnson felt much more personable and relatable than ever before to many viewers. Given the Bloomberg journalist is one of the producers, is this the latest propaganda piece by a supplements-pushing huckster, or is Johnson tapping into something much older and deeper about the human condition?

Reisman argues that McMahon\u2019s invention of \u201Cneokayfabe,\u201D in which storylines and real life are purposefully and artfully confused, blurs the distinction between fact and fiction. It makes consumers, followers, and voters complicit in creating a spectacle of cruelty. It\u2019s the kind of argument that once seen, can\u2019t be unseen. It helps explain the contradictory and performative politics of Trump\u2014and how, under his leadership, the administrative state may not be destroyed by fascism directly, but by a theatre of cynicism and catharsis that will allow the latent fascism of the American Empire to explode.

He quickly found an audience in the tech world, which gave him access to a wide range of celebrities and businesspeople from various domains. By 2024, the podcast became one of the top 5 in the world, netting Bartlett and his team a reported $25M this year alone. Yet as Bartlett\u2019s star rose, his guest list began becoming more and more suspect. Pertinent to our beat, contrarian wellness influencers and philosophers appeared, spreading Covid conspiracies and health misinformation. In his role as curious everyman, Bartlett rarely challenged their narratives, sometimes playing along with their conspiratorial hot takes to an audience in the millions. We look at a few conspiritualist crossovers this week, and discuss what it really takes to become a top 5 podcaster\u2014and the information and integrity that\u2019s sacrificed along the way.

      "description": "Since the election, Democratic voter disbelief and despair has alternated between grief and rage. We watched some erstwhile vociferous critics of Trump in the legacy media, like Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, kiss the ring and bend the knee, while others adopted a contorted posture of seeming legitimization, like NPR hosting Leonard Leo for a nice long sit-down interview. Meanwhile, the big egos of MAGA 2.0 seem to rise like Soviet propaganda banners over the American landscape. Trump has named his cabinet picks at lightning speed. His list includes a pro-wrestling executive, a Hare Krishna cult member, a tech billionaire, an anti-vax conspiracy peddler, a FOX News host with far-right tattoos, an alt-med snake oil salesman, two sex offenders, a COVID-contrarian doctor\u2014and, contrary to his claiming to know nothing about it during the election, prominent Project 2025 authors. What most high profile nominations all have in common is being completely unqualified for the job. Maybe that\u2019s the point. We look at the cabinet picks that intersect with our beat, as pseudoscience conspiracism now completes its journey from the social fringes to deciding White House policies\u2014and all the consequences that entails.

Operating outside of the mainstream church, Opus Dei rose to prominence under Spain\u0027s authoritarian dictator, Francisco Franco.

But we\u0027ve lost all that to the corrupting influence of big money, political correctness, and woke censorship. Blame the radical left. Not to worry: the online charisma of heterodox new media figures like Bari Weiss and her plucky, centrist, truth-telling little start-up, The Free Press, has come to Make Journalism Great Again. Yet their supposed heterodoxy is neither neutral nor journalistically rigorous. It\u0027s pure culture war contrarian sensationalism that wastes little ink critiquing the rise of right-wing authoritarianism.

So, while we gather our feelings and thoughts, Matthew hosts novelist Sheila Heti for a discussion of her encounter with A Course in Miracles, and what she discovered when she investigated its origin story for Harper\u2019s Magazine. Was Helen Schucman, the book\u2019s \u201Cscribe\u201D, mentally ill? Was she unduly influenced by her boss at Columbia Medical School, William Thetford, who once worked for the CIA\u2019s MKUltra programme, and with whom she was clearly in love, even though he was gay? Were they dropping acid on assignment from Langley? Why was the initial dictation of the book so radically altered by its first editors? Why did Helen Schucman curse A Course in Miracles so soon after publication? Why did she keep writing trite poems to Jesus before dying in bitterness? Heti was the ideal gumshoe for this project, because as a novelist all-too-familiar with internal voices and the feeling of \u201Cchanneling,\u201D she was able to feel her way into Helen\u2019s life.

      "description": "On Oct 4, Jay Bhattacharya, a professor of medicine, economics, and health research policy at Stanford, held a symposium at his university. Titled \u201CPandemic Policy: Planning the Future, Assessing the Past,\u201D it was marketed as an open-minded series of panel discussions involving a range of experts to debate and discuss the efficacy of Covid mitigation techniques.\nIn reality, it was a collection of mostly anti-vax and definitely anti-lockdown contrarians that tried in vain to bait people like Dr Peter Hotez to attend in order to give the event an air of legitimacy. Held on the anniversary of the \u201CCovid is bad for business\u201D doctrine, The Great Barrington Declaration, the day presented an opportunity to air supposed \u201Ccensorship\u201D grievances and demands that the public should have a say in the science of future pandemics.\nThe rub: most everyone involved is invested in the economics of public health, not the science, though those lines were freely and falsely blurred throughout the day. Considering Stanford\u2019s new president, economist Jonathan Levin, gave the opening remarks, the Covid contrarians took one more step into the mainstream with their business-first, science-whatever attitudes.\nShow Notes\nPro-COVID UK Charity With Anti-Vax Ties Behind Controversial Stanford Health Policy Conference\nTexas Lt.

Because the world we cover is strewn with the wreckage of charismatic patriarchs who bleed their followers dry in the closed-loop system of cultic dynamics.\u00A0\nWhen leaders like Trump get to the end of the line, all that\u2019s left is pure affect. They have exhausted themselves in the efforts of self-aggrandizement. They have nothing left to say because they\u2019ve said it a 1000 times. They\u2019re all out of stories. They might even be bored of their own bullshit. Underslept or dysregulated by chaotic schedules, they may not be sure where they are. They\u2019re beset by enemies, ill and in cognitive decline, but can\u2019t admit it. And when they start to feel overwhelmed by their followers\u0027 pathetic\u2014in their view\u2014neediness, they will reach for any help they can get in maintaining their emotional dominance.\u00A0\nWhat October 14 showed us is that in these moments, Trump\u2019s go-to resource is canned music, and, without his own iPad at the ready, a DJ handler who can spin the tracks and support his reverie of relief and control.\u00A0\nShow Notes\nTrump holds town hall in Pennsylvania suburbs with focus on economy\u00A0\nHow Media Outlets Covered Trump\u2019s Musical Town Hall\nDonald Trump is DJing weekly at Mar-a-Lago, plays Broadway songs and Celine Dion from his iPad, report says\nDJ T: How Trump controls the music at Mar-a-Lago\u00A0\u00A0\nTwitter thread\u00A0\n152: Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s Krishna Consciousness (w/Nitai Joseph)\nPLAYING FOR OSHO 1989 Introduction \u2013 Chinmaya Dunster\u00A0\nPatted Down by India\u2019s Hugging Saint\u00A0\nThe Soft Nationalism of Amma, India\u2019s Hugging Saint\n37: Guru Jagat Cultjacks Kundalini Yoga (w/Philip Deslippe \u0026 Stacie Stukin)\nLetter to Sogyal Rinpoche from current and ex-Rigpa members details abuse allegations\u00A0\nTrump\u0027s bizarre music session reignites questions about his mental acuity\u00A0\nBrief: Trump\u2019s Impending Ego Implosion (w/ Daniel Shaw) \nTraumatic Narcissism: Relational Systems of Subjugation\nSex abuse allegations surround L.A.

The soil has been poisoned, everyone is fat and sick, the entire medical industry is corrupted by Big Pharma, and Big Food is enacting a genocide on the American people via metabolic dysfunction.

While this event is already infected with tons of conspirituality, one late addition caught our attention: Human Garage. This fascia-release-cures-everything organization had to flee California for Canada due to legal troubles, yet their star continues to rise as they embark on their \u201CTransforming Trauma\u201D world tour. And nothing says \u201Chealing\u201D more than spreading pseudoscientific wellness jargon and hawking turmeric supplements at a Trump event.\nShow Notes\nApostolic Journey to Singapore: Interreligious Meeting with Young People in the Catholic Junior College (13 September 2024) | Francis\u00A0\nLord by Thy Holy Cross\u00A0\nPope: War in Gaza is too much!

The always aspiring poet-philosopher was hired as a messaging advisor to Bobby, after all. We\u2019ve spotted little fragments of Eisenstein\u2019s exceptionally long essays sneaking their way into Bobby\u2019s speeches. There was some influence, for sure, even after Charles went on multiple Costa Rican sabbaticals right in the middle of campaign season and apparently cut his consulting rate down from $21k per month, perhaps out of the goodness of the heart he knows is possible. And yet, for weeks after Bobby jumped the shark, Charles remained silent.\nUntil now, that is. With the publication of his recent 6,711-word essay, \u201CShades of Many Colors,\u201D Eisenstein finally breaks his silence and lands firmly on the side of\u2026well, we\u2019re not quite sure. But one thing that\u2019s emerged is Charles\u2019s penchant for not crediting the source of some of his galaxy-brained ideas.

He does it all with an affable, friendly, just-asking-questions, I\u2019m-not-as-smart-as-my-guests attitude that may disguise what he\u2019s doing\u2014like interviewing a Holocaust-denier Nazi apologist, or framing modern-day dictatorships as admirable, or promoting the anti-semitic Great Replacement Theory, or globe-trotting to flatteringly interviewing brutal enemies of democracy like Viktor Orban or Vladimir Putin.\nIn the wake of recent controversy about WWII revisionism on Carlson\u2019s show, Julian breaks down the accelerationist contours of Tucker\u2019s far-right influence and agenda.

      "description": "Dems are laughing about Donny Dentures or #TrumpisDone, but the reality inside his head, and Mar a Lago, will be very grim, and there will be a lot of collateral damage.\nMental health titans like Robert Lifton have reached the consensus that Trump has been mentally ill for a long time. They\u2019ve diagnosed him with \u201Cnarcissistic personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, paranoid personality disorder, delusional disorder, malignant narcissist,\u201D and so on.\nSuch patients meet predictable ends when the wheels fall off. In the cult world (where Lifton has been so influential), there are bangs (Jim Jones) and there are whimpers (Keith Raniere). What might it look like for Trump?\nNo one is more qualified to discuss the possibilities with Matthew than Daniel Shaw, LCSW, a psychotherapist trained in psychoanalysis as well as in trauma-informed psychotherapies. He is in private practice in New York City and in Nyack, New York; and Faculty and Supervisor at The National Institute for the Psychotherapies in New York. He is the author of Traumatic Narcissism: Relational Systems of Subjugation, published by Routledge in 2014, and nominated for the prestigious Gradiva Award. His book Traumatic Narcissism and Recovery: Leaving the Prison of Shame and Fear was published in 2021.

Another survey of university students found that 44% report using the internet to learn about sadness, anxiety, or confusion. Regardless of what mental health experts advise, people of all age groups are turning to the internet and social media for help.\nWhat are the potential risks and rewards of using these platforms to try to communicate credible mental health science? And what happens when you\u2019re endlessly trolled for being a \u201CBig Pharma shill,\u201D even when you don\u2019t have prescriptive powers and only offer talk therapy in your clinical practice?\nClinical psychologist Jonathan Stea joins us to discuss these difficult questions. His new book, Mind the Science: Saving Your Mental Health from the Wellness Industry, is a field guide that responds to some of the intense challenges earnest seekers face when trying to navigate waters filled with supplements-slinging sharks who believe they can diagnose mental health conditions with zero training.\nShow Notes\nAI-generated video of Trump on ayahuasca\u00A0\nMind the Science: Saving Your Mental Health from the Wellness Industry\nLearn more about your ad choices.

That\u2019s right: last week, the former president shared photos of fans rocking \u201CSwifties for Trump\u201D t-shirts on Truth Social. Trump seemed pleased, replying to his online following of 24 billion people: \u201CI accept.\u201D\nYet something seemed off. Just like photos of Trump surrounded by seven-fingered Black Americans smiling on city stoops, these Swiftie endorsement photos were AI generated. As it turns out, AI is playing a more insidious and dangerous role in this year\u2019s election\u2014and in the conspiracy theory industry\u2014than ever. The line between fact and fiction has long been blurred, but we\u2019re entering a new reality where distinguishing between those two might prove impossible.\nThis week, we look at the stakes of the first AI-generated election in America\u2014and wonder how much worse it can get, even in three short months.\nShow Notes\nTrump Promotes A.I.

      "description": "Eight years ago, they called us cucks, libtards, and globalists. We were corrupted by cultural Marxism, teaching our kids to hate themselves. Four years ago they gloated over drinking liberal tears. They called us sheeple, groomers, vampires, pedos. We made up a pandemic so that we could brew up a kill shot, and force it on everyone after making ourselves soy-boy sick. We were exposing our kids to trans strippers in the library and showing them how to use buttplugs in kindergarten. When our children were sufficiently deranged and submissive, we drained them of adrenochrome and mutilated their privates.\nJD Vance\u2019s ONE JOB was to turn this bullying into policy, and encode it in the pages of Project 2025. Peter Thiel sent him forth to blend every shitpost into a radioactive slurry to power a cybertruck convoy carrying the titans of New Right capitalism into Washington.\u00A0\nHe tried. He really did.\u00A0\nBut then came the stories about him. That he f****d a couch. He wrote about it in his book, someone said. Someone else said he was getting off on dolphin porn. The lies spread, with glee and schadenfreude. And he folded. Like a foldaway.\u00A0\nSuddenly, all the green drained out of million shriveling Pepes and made the world verdant with hope. And from the middle of a cornfield football grid, Tim Walz manifests with his Big Dad grin and said, \u0022Let\u2019s roll up our sleeves and beat these creepy weirdos.\u201D\nToday we\u2019ll talk about fighting conspiracy theories that started as jokes with jokes that defuse conspiracy theories.

      "description": "You\u2019re an eight year-old girl. The purity culture of your evangelical church, ruled by men but policed by women, has you worried that the spaghetti straps on your summer top might be sinful. You learn from the women around you how to defer, serve, please, keep your voice girl-like forever, and use it to both signal obedience but also piously request relief from sexual aggression. You\u2019re a seven year-old boy. The holy laws of gender in your church dictate that when you\u2019re the only male present at Bible study, you must lead the room full of women in reading and prayer. You must perform manliness in your boy\u2019s body, assuming an anxious leadership role you did not earn. If you don\u2019t puff yourself up, you\u2019re a sissy\u2014one of the girls alongside you learning the tones of the Fundie Baby Voice. These are parts of the stories of Julia Postema and Jeremiah Gibson, the co-hosts of the podcast Sexvangelicals: The Sex Education the Church Didn\u0027t Want You to Have. They are Boston-based licensed psychotherapists and certified sex therapists. They specialize in helping couples with negative religious backgrounds discover sexuality that works for their partnership. Julian and I sat down with them to learn about how their clients recover from purity culture, and sometimes in the process run smack into its mirror world: the tantric workshop land of divine masculine and feminine stereotypes plus fascinations with semen retention.

Vance has made a dramatic U-turn from calling Trump a \u0022reprehensible idiot\u0022 and \u0022America\u0027s Hitler\u0022 in 2016. But who is this 39 year old, really\u2014who after less than two years of on-the-job experience, is now almost a heartbeat away from leading the free world?\nWell, not unlike other right-wing populists in Europe and at home, Vance has an idiosyncratic political affinity for JRR Tolkien. We might even call him America\u2019s conspiracy hobbit at this point, fresh from the Appalachian Shire but inexorably drawn by the burning crypto rings of Silicon Valley to eventually land at the feet of Sauron to meet his fate.\u00A0\nBut to answer this question and examine where JD Vance fits into the conspirituality landscape, we\u2019ll be breaking down a speech recently released by ProPublica. It\u2019s from an intimate invitation-only conservative event hosted in 2021 by a group called the Teneo Network. Behind closed doors, Vance encouraged his audience to get away from that weird feeling in their chests when listening to the unique truths of conspiracy theorists. Like, Alex Jones sees the world more clearly than MSNBC\u0027s Rachel Maddow. The right also apparently needs more oligarchs. Oh, and the literal Devil is at work in the world around us.\nShow Notes\nJ.D.

In a lot of ways, that question is beside the point. It\u2019s not the \u201870s anymore.

Since he announced his theory in 2015 (and published it on Twitter in 2017), he\u2019s been repeatedly criticized. In this latest round, that criticism is coming from Eric Weinstein, who appeared on physicist Brian Keating\u2019s podcast to discuss Howard\u2019s math.

      "description": "In 2020, former NY Times journalist Isabel Wilkerson published Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents. The book tells a compelling story: that the root of our social divisions is the invented hierarchical structure of castes, not, as we often assume in America, race. Race, she writes, is only another manifestation of caste. While it\u2019s certainly an important topic here in America, Wilkerson shows, by investigating the longstanding caste system in India, the social divisions in Nazi Germany, and America\u2019s founding and expansion through chattel slavery, that caste is a universal phenomenon.

Derek and Julian talk to Movement Logic hosts, Laurel Beversdorf and Sarah Court, who navigate the curvilinear path of creating irreverent yet high quality science-based movement content that sets teachers and students free from dogma and fear-mongering. Our two podcasts intersect by looking into fallen gurus, pseudoscience health claims, dodgy alignment dogmas, and cults of personality susceptible to the dangers of conspiracism. And this week we\u2019re diving into a recent Movement Logic episode on back pain specialist, Stuart McGill. Yet, as this conversation shows, all hope is not lost, and all physical culture is not a pipeline into body fascism, or worse\u2014multi-level marketing. There are still intelligent and grounded educators who share the love of movement, infused with the logic and humility of science.

Both leaders invested the images and remains of the unborn with passionate but imaginary desires that obscured from them how much harm they were causing. One of them exited that highway, but the other is still burning it up. Includes the story of Kermit Gosnell, and how his Philadelphia abortion abattoir exemplified a political and moral disaster worthy of Naomi Klein. An obvious, organized crime, something that everyone could see but some tried to paper over, aided and abetted by the dominant order and progressive hypocrisy. Something that becomes the focal point of reasonable rage, but then leads to twisted conclusions. Content warning: abortion details. Full Show Notes available on Patreon.

He argued that beliefs, far from being central to or definitive of religion, are actually antithetical to religious community. A religion\u2019s historical longevity, he argued, depends on its ability to absorb and neutralize beliefs\u2014epistemological dead ends built on willful ignorance. \u201CThe challenge to religion,\u201D Carse says, \u201Cis not its opponents from without, but its believers from within, and the real enemy of religion is belief itself.\u201D What does this mean for a project like Conspirituality and other projects of disillusionment carried out in the shadow of New Atheism and other modern skeptical movements?

      "description": "A Deep Cut from our Patreon archive (July 2023) What do we mean when we say that we believe something? When the QAnon Shaman got dressed on the morning of January 6, he put on his red, white, and blue face paint, his postmodern quasi-Native American horned fur hat, and grabbed the spear to which he had attached an American flag. In performance mode, this cosplay persona had already garnered him a taste of the attention that would soon increase exponentially as he became the most recognizable figure of the Capitol Riot. In today\u2019s Bonus, Julian argues that his costume, as well as his ritual actions on that day were also an expression of a political worldview, run through with deeply held spiritual beliefs about the world and his role in it. The history of political religion, propagandistic conspiracies, and progressive spiritual convictions may show that\u2014far from being trivial\u2014belief is at the heart of the American, and perhaps the human, story.

      "description": "\u201CCult expert\u201D Steve Hassan has been publicly concerned with the complex sociology of trans youth since 2020. We track that interest back to his communications with gender critical activists in 2017, who reached out to him because they believed that his cult theory could shed light on what they believed were nefarious aspects of the trans awareness movement. In the spirit of helpfulness, but without any chops in the subject, he stepped up to the plate and started swinging. Regardless of how earnest or paranoid his concern is, his access to this landscape has been bought with his intellectual legacy, and been filtered through networks that question trans identity altogether. His most inflammatory (but also silly) claim is that many young people are being hypnotized by online pornography and influenced by social media groups to the extent they inexorably choose medical transition. We investigate and analyze this unfortunate skid into the culture war mud. Hassan has stated at length his opposition to the \u201Ccancel culture\u201D he believes is directed at Rowling and himself. This episode is not that. It\u2019s a sober evaluation of legacy, disciplinary overreach, and what better public intellectual engagement would look like.

      "description": "Matthew is joined by historian Neil J. Young, co-host of the excellent Past Present Podcast, to talk about his new book: Coming Out Republican: a History of the Gay Right. Young\u2019s riveting storytelling shows how, beginning in the aftermath of WWII, many American gay men\u2014born into socially conservative and religious families from which they had struggled to individuate\u2014hitched the wagon of their political hopes to a Republican party they believed would champion their privacy and individual civil rights. Ground zero for their fiercely libertarian clubs and action committees was San Francisco, where a culture of rugged entrepreneurship fostered the slogan \u201CKeep the government out of our bedrooms, and out of our wallets.\u201D It was an individualist politics that looked to Civil Rights and women\u2019s rights movements for inspiration, but not allyship. In time that same GOP would lead a culture war against everything queer\u2014paradoxically led by closeted gay politicians who, with deeply conflicted motives, legislated against their fellows. But even as the tide turned, many gay Republicans kept their shoulders to the unforgiving wheel of respectability politics. Young illuminates the flashes of bravery and self-reliance in these men\u2019s stories, but also shows what happens when a marginalized group seeks acceptance and political power\u2014instead of liberation\u2014within a culture built on exclusion.

But they\u2019re also paradoxically defending a troubled American legacy against a librarian culture attempting to course-correct towards greater inclusion. To discuss this problem, Matthew talks to Heath Umbreit, a reference librarian who works at a public library in the northeastern U.S. Mis- and disinformation has been a professional and personal interest of theirs for several years; Heath\u0027s study of the phenomenon focuses on a critical examination of popular narratives about disinformation, the concept of epistemic supremacy, and the ways in which information and disinformation intersect with systemic power differentials in American society.

After a little stage-setting on the heterodox mediasphere, we open with a snapshot of conspirituality Valhalla as we listen in on Joe Rogan and Chris Rufo talking about unhoused people as though they are children who haven\u2019t been given good boundaries. Then we\u2019ll look at four instances in which the spectacle brokers meet reality. What happens when Chaya Raichik gets bodied by Taylor Lorenz? What happens when the Moms for Liberty have to explain themselves on 60 minutes? What happens when Destiny rejects Jordan Peterson\u2019s bullshit? And what happens when the mack daddy of it all, Alex Jones, gets confronted by Sandy Hook parents, face to face? Does reality break through?

The slogan, \u201CWoman, Life, Freedom,\u201D which first emerged in the fight for Kurdish equality, was used by thousands of brave, defiant women in Iran (along with male supporters), who called for an end to oppression, discrimination, tyranny, and dictatorship. Eighteen months later, the Iranian government has increased video surveillance and morality police patrols, imposed even harsher penalties for female disobedience, and leaned even further into brutal torture methods and daily executions. Meanwhile, Ali Khamenei\u2019s administration floods the population with propaganda and conspiracy theories.

Not so, we argue in this brief. Deception in one mirrors deception in the other, and there is no private life for the influencer who wants to influence your private life. Beyond shilling for Athletic Greens and saying that sunscreen winds up in your brain, Huberman opines on relationships, sex, and addiction issues as if he is an expert\u2014instead of (an alleged) hot mess. Pseudoscience and pseudotherapy are parallel harms\u2014both using manipulative jargon to convince consumers or women respectively that the influencer is well-researched and using best practices to be of service.

He blockaded abortion clinics, screamed at women in crisis, used fetal remains as political props, and helped wage a covert war of moneyed influence over federal officials to end abortion access. Now, in a return to his deeper religious commitments, he is repenting his past. In an interview with Matthew, he discusses his blissful conversion experience as a teenager rooted in what he believed was a radical social justice movement. And he describes what he now sees: an anti-abortion movement helping to galvanize the Christian Nationalism poised to wreak havoc on American politics, and what we can do to push back against its aggression.

A stream of what looks like blood shoots out from between his fingers. After a few more finger wiggles, he appears to pull several bloody cocktail shrimp out of an invisible incision. The patient is healed. Of something. Welcome to \u201Cpsychic surgery.\u201D Documentarian of the uncanny, Brad Abrahams, takes our correspondent seat this week to explain how Shirley MacLaine, Burt Lancaster, Andy Kaufman, Charlie Mingus, and tens of thousands of Americans got drawn into the morbid healing craze that kicked off in the 1970s, and which may have seen its last hurrah with the imprisonment of Brazil\u2019s John of God. Centuries of colonization in Brazil and the Philippines, Brad explains, made conventional medical care basically unavailable for anyone poor or outside of major cities. This left a void for traditional and alternative healing to fill as the only real options, as well as provide a connection to a cultural identity that had been systematically repressed. And of course, charlatans rode the wave. Brad brings his characteristic curiosity, empathy, and cultural competence, holding the door open for us to imagine why this abject form of medical and spiritual fraud speaks so deeply to so many.

      "description": "In the early days of the pandemic, most of the cultural focus was on the necessity of quarantine measures and the distinction between mild and severe COVID infections. Yet by May 2020, some were experiencing the phenomenon of long COVID. Now understood as a post-acute infection syndrome, patients suffering from it have endured mockery, stigmatization, and accusations of lying. Nonetheless, support and patient advocacy groups have led the way, first in demanding medical and social recognition, and now in consulting with receptive researchers on diagnosis and treatment. We\u2019re joined by science journalist Tara Haelle, whose work has appeared in Scientific American, NY Times, Washington Post, and more. She\u2019s also the Infectious Disease Core Topic Leader at the Association of Health Journalists. Her work covering the pandemic, vaccines, and the Long COVID connection, which combines reporting on the latest science as well as writing from patients and patient advocates, has been indispensable in understanding this spectrum of diseases.

Vinay Prasad cuts a different type of figure on the conspiracy-influencer stage. He fits right in with his pal, the charismatic guru-esque Dr. Zubin Damania, and might just pop up in your YouTube feed alongside Andrew Huberman and Peter Attia. Prasad demands unrealistic randomized controlled trial data for everything on his podcast, including protecting ICU patients from Covid via visiting restrictions. Who\u2019s volunteering for that control group?! Julian sits down with returning guest, Dr. Jonathan Howard, the author of We Want Them Infected. They talk about Prasad (among others) who play a sensationalist science-distortion role in the digital economy and their connections to libertarian think tanks like AIER (architects of the Great Barrington Declaration) and Brownstone Institute\u2014who\u2019s founder, Jeffrey Tucker, wants to repeal laws around child labor and underage smoking.

When Naomi Wolf isn\u2019t explaining to Steve Bannon where women\u2019s liberation went wrong, she\u2019s worried that vaccinated women are poisoning non-vaccinated women just by walking past them. The train of messianic women wellness influencers rumbles on and on.

And how does their propaganda\u2014rolled out in blockbuster trauma porn events like Sound of Freedom\u2014stigmatize and endanger adult sex workers, especially those who are already marginalized? Esme Providence Brown returns as our correspondent to run it down. Brown retired from professional sex work in 2021 after twenty-year career in Manhattan. She first joined us on Episode 169 to talk about the strange overlaps between sex work and the neo-tantra yoga movement. In this richly-researched report and discussion with Matthew, she examines the history of and present-day ramifications of anti-trafficking movements\u2014projects that often scapegoat women who are secretly desired but publicly hated. \u201CEverybody wants to save the children,\u201D Brown says, \u201Cbut very few people want to step into the tangled web of what this actually means or the history of how \u2018salvation\u2019 movements - hobbled by grandiosity, white knighthood, and patriarchal ignorance\u2014have incurred collateral damage while failing in their ultimate mission of liberation.\u201D\u00A0 Show notes for this one are extensive, and won\u2019t fit into most pod apps.

Project 2025 rests on four pillars devoted to the implementation of the unitary executive theory\u2014basically, all levers of the American government bowing down to the executive branch. If this sounds like a roadmap to authoritarianism, that\u2019s because it is. With 54 conservative and religious organizations signing on and over 450 contributors, as well as untold millions in dark money, Heritage is leading the charge with this anti-abortion, anti-LBGTQ\u002B, anti-DEI, anti-civil liberties game plan. To date, they\u2019ve interviewed thousands of prospective candidates for the next administration, with the goal of hiring tens of thousands of subservient bureaucrats ready to implement this Christian Nationalistic plan.

This week, Julian and Matthew discuss Gadzhi\u0027s seemingly plagiarized rhetoric that invites preteen boys from Boston to Belarus to drop out of school.

Julian discusses Gadzhi\u0027s deceptive social-media-based marketing in the context of election-disrupting technologies.

RKF Jr., who has campaigned as the peace candidate who will draw down the US military empire, has recently called Israel America\u2019s \u201Caircraft carrier\u201D in the Middle East. When challenged to call for a ceasefire as the casualties rise in Gaza, the self-proclaimed protector of children said, \u201Cnobody likes children dying,\u201D but then compared Israel\u2019s efforts against Hamas to Alliance efforts against the Nazis. On Gaza and Israel, RFK Jr is sounding unlike the end-the-forever wars, bring-our-troops-home candidate that many of his followers in the alternative health, anti-vax, and New Age spiritual communities thought they were supporting. Now he\u2019s paying the price. Lifelong pacifist Dennis Kucinich quit the Kennedy24 campaign nine days after Israel began its retaliation for the Hamas attacks. RFK Jr.\u2019s Director of Messaging, Charles Eisenstein, is speaking out against his boss\u2019s one-sided stance. And alternative health and anti-vax mogul Sayer Ji has withdrawn his endorsement in a newsletter sent out to 300K subscribers. Matthew reports on the developments and poses the questions: What is it about Gaza that suddenly makes the mainstream media reports credible to conspiritualists\u2014as opposed to the news from Ukraine, or about COVID?

His life and career path is symbiotic with the platform, mirroring, monetizing, and accelerating every self-help and get-rich trend that blows through through the algorithms.\u00A0 At some point during COVID, he caught the conspiracy theory bug, and turned his channel into a red pill factory, pumping out such volumes of aggressively paranoid content that YouTube money bros started comparing him to Andrew Tate.\u00A0 Now, Gadzhi is reaching more aggressively into the brains of pre-teen boys around the world with a morbid fantasy about the origins of public education, and how it dooms them all into woke slavery. But it\u2019s not just a conspiracy theory. It\u2019s a highly-structured marketing campaign pitching his online sales coaching scheme as a substitute for high school.

Alt-right rabble-rouser and pseudo-intellectual, Steve Bannon, was part of the team that salvaged Trump\u2019s floundering 2016 campaign. Like Roger Stone and Mike Flynn, he was in the war room at the Willard Hotel around January 6, 2020\u2014having told his podcast audience that \u201Call hell is going to break loose.\u201D What happened between those dates is quite a tale. With Trump\u2019s 2024 candidacy looming, Steve Bannon remains poised to bring his nasty visions to life. *Correction: During this bonus, Julian mistakenly says Trump called it \u201CThe Movement.\u201D He meant to say that Bannon did.

The elder Grenon, Mark, had founded the Genesis II Church of Health \u0026 Healing alongside of MMS\u0027s founder, Jim Humble, who left the church in 2017.\nHow did the Grenons profit from industrial-strength bleach for 13 years before finally being convicted?

It\u2019s also a Dante-esque spiral down through our endless circles of historical and cultural hell. Klein\u2019s core subject is the \u201CMirror World\u201D we now battle in: a place where our digital avatars occlude our bodies, where morbid fantasies blot out fact-checked histories, where the fool\u2019s gold of influencers outshines the daily work of researchers. It\u2019s a place where antimaskers steal the \u201CI can\u2019t breathe\u201D cry of George Floyd, and antivax influencers pretend they are being led to the gas chambers. It\u2019s a place where selfish demagogues appropriate and mimic the poetry of social justice, but only for a select few. It\u2019s where MAGA movement architect Steve Bannon LARPs as a therapist for the common man.  Doppelganger has landed like a Rosetta Stone for divining the incoherent politics of the figures we\u2019ve covered all these years\u2014and the cultural and moral vacuums they fill.

It\u0027s also an effective way to shut down criticism of whatever you\u0027re selling.

Esme asked if we would like to discuss the strange and taboo overlaps between yoga, wellness, neo-tantra, and sex work. I wrote back immediately to say yes.\u00A0 Esme has worked as a professional dominatrix and kink provider for the past twenty years. In 2012, she began teaching yoga and investigating the intersection of sex work and spirituality through her practice and writing. She lives and works in NYC, and is now doing academic work in textiles. Matthew spoke to her while she was on a research trip to Indonesia.\u00A0 We think you\u2019ll all learn a ton from this conversation about transparent vs. non-transparent labour practices, performative intimacy, the gendered inequalities of wellness work, and how Neo-Tantrics who use handguns in their foreplay made their presence known at the January 6th insurrection.

      "description": "Deep Cut pulls from our bonus episode archive to unearth previous ideas that remain relevant today. News from Alabama: after a 23-year ban on yoga in schools, generated by a Republican moral panic, Governor Kay Ivey signs a bill that lets kids do yoga again, but with some restrictions: \u0022All instruction in yoga shall be limited exclusively to poses, exercises, and stretching techniques. All poses shall be limited exclusively to sitting, standing, reclining, twisting, and balancing. All poses, exercises, and stretching techniques shall have exclusively English descriptive names. Chanting, mantras, mudras, use of mandalas, induction of hypnotic states, guided imagery, and namaste greetings shall be expressly prohibited.\u0022 Those who promote yoga as universal goodwill welcome this Indian art form being made more accessible for children in a State with terrible educational markers. Hindu nationalists, on the other hand, might be outraged at a secularized version of yoga, stripped not only of references to Hinduism but of signs of any type of Indian spirituality.\u00A0And a lot of white yoga progressives will look at this policy\u2014mostly from the urban North\u2014 and worry about authenticity and appropriation. How will the children feel? In considering who wins and loses with this new development, Matthew reviews recent U.S. yoga-war history: battles between the Hindu American Foundation and Yoga Journal, the rise of Christian non-yoga-yoga \u0022Praise Moves\u0022, and Encinitas Union School District got sued for allegedly violating the Establishment Clause by contracting devotees of Pattabhi Jois to teach the kids yoga. It\u0027s not a stretch to see an overlap between this theme and the medical-moral panic over vaccines. In both cases, the focus is on the imagined corruption of children, whether by poison, politics, or inner quiet.

It took him years of scholarship to see how this political ideology had been baked into the religious indoctrination.

Why is he polling at 20%, with his favorability in double digits against Biden?\u00A0 It\u2019s not just that his endless rhetoric appeals to libertarians on the right and paranoiacs on the left. It\u2019s that he casts a charismatic spell that echoes, exacerbates, and amplifies some of the deepest conflicts in the American psyche\u2014between tradition and rebellion, nostalgia and grievance, idealism and paranoia. Bobby, you see, is never quite who he seems to be. In one moment he\u2019s the prodigal prince of Camelot, seen through a sepia lens.

His regular two- to four-hour episodes feature a dizzying assault of information on topics like physical and mental fitness, psychedelics, hair loss, brain optimization, and a host of other topics, sometimes with expert guests, while at other times he goes solo. And many of these episodes are super informative and inspirational.\u00A0 And yet, at times it seems like Huberman is sacrificing quality for quantity. This week, we look at three instances in which Andrew Huberman appears to be speaking outside of his lane, or perhaps overhyping supplements for his own benefit, and we want to know what else is being sacrificed along the way.

Last week, Julian addressed the aching questions asked by those in love with the positive gifts of contemplative practice, but who now see the cognitive fallacies and naive psychology at play in many spiritual communities. This week, Matthew sets pseudoscience and spiritual bypassing into the social context of cultic relationships, reviewing some of the tortured dynamics we monitored during COVID, laying out a few cult-resistant hygiene rules, some pointers on avoiding stigmatization, and asking tough questions about where the whole cult discourse thing is going in this parasocial era.

Yet when one reporter\u2014Vanity Fair\u2019s Dan Adler\u2014had the audacity to report on one now-deceased confidante of William, the self-proclaimed medium went on the defense, releasing a four-part podcast series and posting on social media in a frenzy about how there\u2019s a plot to \u201Ctake down Medical Medium.\u201D Yes, William speaks of himself often in the third person, and wears his lack of any medical training whatsoever as a badge of honor. Today, we look at some of the most outrageous claims that he\u2019s made and discuss the rhetorical techniques that have made him an alt-health celebrity. We\u2019re also joined by Dan Adler to discuss his in-depth reporting on the man who claims angels give him medical advice decades ahead of modern science\u2014and somehow gets away with it.

      "description": "What \u0022really\u0022 happened during the pandemic? Conspiracists have decided to take a victory lap. They were right, you see? The vaccines failed, and besides, they were super dangerous. COVID obviously came out of a lab. Masks were useless, and the lock-downs were completely unnecessary forms of totalitarian oppression. The authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, who were censored on social media, were right all along. Not so fast. Our guest today is Dr. Jonathan Howard, who not only did grueling service at Bellevue Hospital in NYC (as the first wave raged, and corpses were stacked in meat trucks) but has put in the time to create a comprehensive document of how contrarian doctors shaped cultural perceptions during the pandemic. He takes the title of his new book, We Want Them Infected, from a quote found in a series of emails from July 2020. Trump-appointed science-advisor to the HHS, Paul Alexander, urged officials there and at the FDA, and the CDC, to pursue a herd immunity strategy for COVID-19. \u0022There is no other way,\u0022 he wrote. \u0022We need to establish herd, and it only comes about when we allow non-high-risk groups to expose themselves to the virus. PERIOD. Infants, kids, teens, young people, middle-aged with no conditions have zero to little risk. So we use them to develop herd. We want them infected.\u0022 Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "Marianne Williamson? Inexperienced? Not at all. In fact, she does have a ton of experience\u2026 in New Age, on-stage pseudotherapy, where she solves the problems of the troubled with memorized lines from A Course in Miracles. She\u2019s been doing these sessions at workshops and retreats for decades, and the schtick is always the same: if only the person would change their minds about their problem, the world would be healed.\u00A0 While this may fly on the workshop circuit, if you listen carefully you\u2019ll hear that she gives the same answer on the stump. It comes through most clearly when she\u2019s pressed on questions of strategy. She will instantly pivot to talking about the spirit and the soul. The effect is a disarming oscillation between the political and the personal. Are we talking about defeating fascists? No, no, that\u2019s too worldly! We\u2019re talking about opening our hearts. And if that feels good during a politically tense exchange, it\u2019s because she changed the subject. To see how this sleight-of-hand works, Matthew examines two classic Williamson encounters to show that the answers she gives on the stump aren\u2019t much different from the answers she gives on her New Age retreats.\u00A0 Show Notes That Time Byron Katie Gaslit a Follower about Trump | by Matthew Remski\u00A0 I\u0027m Afraid of Trump\u2014The Work of Byron Katie Being Rejected for Your Spiritual Beliefs | Q\u0026A With Marianne Williamson\u00A0 Mindfulness can make you selfish: A pioneering new study examines the social effects of mindfulness\u00A0 Marianne Williamson with TYT\u0027s John Iadarola \u0026 Francesca Fiorentini Learn more about your ad choices.

That if I could be seen, I would be loved, and if loved, I would be real. \u201CIf there is an anxiety at the core of the influencers we study, it might be related to this. This week I had the opportunity to meditate on it, to remember how charisma formed around and within me, first through an arts education, and then as a yoga and wellness entrepreneur. It\u2019s made me wonder whether and how I\u2019ve been that much different than Zach Bush, or Mikki Willis, or Katie Griggs.

      "description": "Conspiritualists are not wrong that Jeffery Epstein\u2019s downline has so far evaded justice. Or that the highest levels of the Catholic Church aided and abetted child sexual abuse for generations. They are not wrong about the existence of child sexual abuse materials circulating online, and that children are coerced, abducted, and sometimes killed in order to make them.\u00A0 But their narratives are contorted by panic, mythology, stereotypes, paranoid and grandiose assumptions, and the antisemitic conspiracy theorizing of QAnon, which spread like wildfire through yoga and wellness social media during the pandemic and has now normalized as the \u201Cgroomer\u201D meme. They say that child sexual abuse is a planned, nefarious, top-down attack on innocents. They say that its purpose is to turn the world away from God, to starve humanity of hope. Matthew sits down with H\u00E5kon H\u00F8ydal, an investigative journalist in Norway who has spent years researching and exposing the most abject behaviors on the dark web. His work reveals a very different landscape. It\u2019s a banal world, close to home, hiding in plain sight, presided over by young men who are making reckless choices after having decided that their pathological and criminally harmful impulses will never be understood, much less treated.\u00A0 Show Notes Hunting Warhead | CBC News\u00A0 VG exposed the largest child sexual abuse forum.

      "description": "Matthew sits down with Sam Binkley, Professor of Sociology at Emerson College in Boston to discuss his 2007 book Getting Loose: Lifestyle Consumption in the 1970s. We cited this very helpful work as we dug into the sociology of conspirituality for our own upcoming book. Here\u2019s a thumbnail of Binkley\u2019s argument: The 1970s ushered in a period of \u201Cgetting loose\u201D in relation to the body, work expectations, family relations, and political allegiances. This happened as the great moral and political questions of the 1960s deflated without resolution, even as they enshrined looser social mores around sex and finding meaningful work. The cultural yearning for structural change found its home in the project of the self, facilitated by an accelerated consumerism that expanded the conflation of agency with consumption. Getting Loose characterizes this inward turn as a retreat from the terrors of revolutionary freedom.

And Cinderella Castle will be remodeled into a Potemkin Capitol where Mikki Willis will choreograph and film daily insurrections. The groundwork is being laid now, as we explore the institutionalization of QAnon. Moms for Liberty, egged on by Mike Flynn, is taking over school boards throughout the Sunshine State. Chris Rufo is now a college trustee, and Bret Weinstein is holding court in state medical committees. All while our conspirituality influencers, from Sears to Northrup to Avocado Wolfe, cheer on the dissolution of every social contract, every veneer of democracy.\u00A0 The propaganda and sadism is so despairing that Derek might need religion, and Matthew might lose himself in retro fantasies of Disneyworld.

The Valentine\u0027s Day weekend crystals and angel cards fest of disjointed spirituality meets dodgy science just celebrated its 21st year as the premiere gathering point for awakened seekers choosing to come out of sovereign superposition and manifest in space-time reality.  But, as visiting Vice News correspondent Anna Merlan tells us, it turns out the organizers have grappled for years with how to reconcile the tensions between obvious charlatans and those who really, truly can talk to the dead, psychics who can diagnose your dog\u0027s mystery ailments, and those making artificial claims about all-natural elixirs, prophets of light and love, and QAnon promoting anti-vax conspiritualists.  This year\u0027s solution? Tuck the most radicalized New Age hate-preachers away in the Rabbit Hole Room, and charge top-dollar for the red-pilled faithful to swoon at their feet.

      "description": "Today, Hulu releases a 3-episode doc series called \u201CStolen Youth,\u201D directed by Zach Heinzerling.  The pole star for this low-dopamine, low-cortisol, non-true-crime, survivor-centred documentary is Daniel Levin\u2019s painful and radiant memoir, Slonim Woods 9. In 2010, Levin was drawn into an extended-family domestic abuse group led by Larry Ray, the father of one of his friends at Sarah Lawrence College. It took him years to leave, years to begin to recover, and years to become the de facto subject coordinator for this film.  Matthew talks with Zach and Daniel about what it takes to really listen to survivors of group abuse, and how the arts of memoir and documentary can be doorways to reconnection and integration.  In an interview debrief, Julian and Matthew discuss why reviewing Stolen Youth is such a relief in the current Wild West cultsploitation landscape.  Well-told stories in this zone\u2014and we need more of them\u2014educate, de-sensationalize, and de-stigmatize.

      "description": "Perhaps you\u2019ve seen the Rumi quote repeated on social media memes: \u201CThe wound is the place where the Light enters you.\u201D The wounded healer is a popular archetype in wellness spaces, and indeed, sometimes experience teaches wisdom, enabling the victim to overcome their trauma and help others. But in conspiritualist spaces, the wounded healer can also begin a monetization stream where everything becomes evidence of trauma, only to be healed through this book, or that course, or a brand-new brand of meditation that\u2019s only the marketing scheme of an old form. Speaking of brands, we look at the wounded healer through the lens of Russell Brand, among others. This leads to Derek\u2019s interview with YouTuber and podcaster, Chris Boutte, aka The Rewired Soul, who happens to be in recovery and watched firsthand as Russell went from helpful figure to shadowy archetype. Can an addiction to drugs be healed, only to lead to an addiction to clicks and likes?

We\u0027re specifically referring to political tensions over the holiday dinner table. You know, the vegan sister insisting on a land acknowledgment before the QAnon uncle says grace, while the anti-vax aunt rants at her to take off her mask. Can somebody pass the apple pie?  Our guest today is journalist, author, and political analyst, Anand Giridharadas. Julian spoke with him about his new book, The Persuaders, in which he profiles people on the ground working to change minds, bridge divisions and fight for democracy. The Persuaders offers inspiration to those who refuse to accept that a rigid polarization in which no one ever changes their mind, is the new normal.

      "description": "Matthew and Julian sit down for the first of a two-part examination of the 1988 bestseller at the heart of the recovered memory movement\u2014which played a central role in validating Satanic Panic testimonials. This is episode 9 of the Swan Song Series 9.The basic premise of The Courage to Heal, by creative writing instructors Ellen Bass and Laura Davis,\u00A0 is that memories of childhood abuse, especially child sexual abuse, can be recovered and articulated by survivors who are given the proper space, tools, and validation. The book explores how this be facilitated within the context of journaling, writing poetry, and writing memoir, and what the therapeutic benefits of full confessional articulation can be.While countless people affirm that this book was a lifeline during a time in which recovery resources for child abuse survivors were rare,\u00A0 there are substantial problems with the book\u0027s method, claims about memory, dodgy sources, and endorsement of outright Satanic Panic propaganda.

Girl, Interrupted is a freewheeling adaptation of a 1993 memoir by Susanna Kaysen about the 18 months she spent undergoing treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder in a Massachusetts psychiatric facility in the late 1960s. This episode 8 of the Swan Song Series.This study is provoked by a memory recounted by Swan\u0027s childhood friend, Diana Hansen Ribera, that Swan identified with the character of Lisa Rowe in the film. Angelina Jolie won an Oscar for her searing performance of Rowe, a sociopath. In this second episode, we explore several characters that Swan may have (and may yet) identify with, discuss the awkwardness of portraying mental health narratives on the big screen, and what it would really take for such an intense film to be digestible for typical teenagers. Matthew ends with a meditation on immersive/claustrophobic media\u2014which Swan goes on to master\u2014compared with the relief of developing a meta-view capable of inhabiting many stories, as opposed to imitating one.Show NotesSENECA THE YOUNGER, HERCULES FURENS - Theoi Classical Texts LibraryHercules (Seneca)Girl, Interrupted \u2014 Susanna Kaysen1607: Growing up with Teal Swan - Diana Hansen RiberaMad, Bad, and Sad: Women and the Mind Doctors by Lisa AppignanesiBrittany Murphy: Inside Her Sudden Death at 32 That Still Confounds Hollywood -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

That trend has only intensified in recent months, with grifters like Peter McCullough and Mikki Willis getting in on the supplement game. In part three of his trilogy on supplements, Derek talks with dietician Kevin Klatt about what supplements are actually good for\u2014as well as how this unregulated industry is monetizing fears around future viruses. They also discuss the wild west of nootropics, supposed brain-enhancing substances that don\u2019t scare you about pandemics, but instead make you believe that with just a little more optimization you\u2019ll be the most perfect you possible\u2026until another product drop, that is. To discuss the world of lack that other influencers capitalize on, we\u2019ll discuss the annual A Fest, a TED-style wellness gathering for millionaires that banks on you never actually feeling content in your life, but instead chasing a promise of unachievable eternal betterment.

Worse still, we\u0027re supposedly defending \u0022groomers\u0022 and \u0022child mutilation.\u0022  Meanwhile literal swastika flag-waving Nazis, as well as Proud Boys, Patriot Front, and other armed militia-types are increasingly showing up outside LGBTQ venues across the country. Terrorists deliberately sabotaged a North Carolina power grid, in an act many believe was designed to stop a drag show.\u00A0Forty thousand people were without power for four days in early December as a result.  At the epicenter of this latest toxic culture war shock-wave is The Daily Wire. Funded by idiosyncratic religious fundamentalists who believe abortion and homosexuality are not only sins, but should be crimes\u2014their roster of edgy, slickly produced personalities, like Ben Shapiro, Matt Walsh, Candace Owens, and now, Jordan Peterson, all go hard on the ugliest characterizations, both of LGBTQ people, and of the teachers and doctors who\u00A0care for them. Julian shows how they have picked up on James Lindsay\u0027s outrageous conspiracy claim of a \u0022handshake agreement\u0022 between communists and pedophiles, and how the \u0022grass roots\u0022 moral panic org. with super PAC funding, Moms for Liberty, is hijacking school boards in Red states and Blue.  -- -- -- Support us on Patreon  Pre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada  Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | Julian  Original music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

Of course, that\u2019s if you live in America, since every other country on the planet cleanses four times a year. Seriously.

      "description": "The homestretch of our study of Michelle Remembers zeroes in on the literal symbols\u2014and symbols gone literal\u2014of the Satanic Panic. (This is episode 6 of\u00A0 the Swan Song Series.)Archetypes, gore, anxieties about sex and babies and filth: Lawrence Pazder mined it all, using modes of abstraction and dehumanization as old as religion itself to weave a story he claimed was all about Michelle\u2014but was really an exercise of his own fetishes.Michelle Smith could have received proper care for her understandable stresses. She could have offered up her feelings and sensations and images from dreams for discussion and contemplation, and an actual therapist would have held that material safely for her to explore. But in Pazder, Smith found someone who wasn\u2019t interested in common human complexity. He was interested in cosmic warfare, and the role he could LARP within it.But Pazder was so blind to his craven narcissism that he couldn\u2019t help but tell on himself. In the final passage we analyze, Pazder records Smith demanding to end therapy. \u201CIf I could tear out my tongue,\u201D she says, \u201CI would never have to speak again.\u201D But in the very next paragraph, the man who is forcing her to \u201Cremember\u201D symbolically tears out her tongue, rejecting her plea to end the sessions, interpreting her demand as though it were coming from Satan himself.She imagines herself getting in a car and driving and driving, anywhere. Away from this psychiatrist who wanted to be an exorcist, away from his story, perhaps to find her own.

      "description": "An ancient text at the root of the culture that gave birth to the yoga tradition says that if an outcaste person\u2014a Dalit\u2014dares to learn the holy language of Sanskrit, they must be tortured. Molten lead must be poured into their ears. Their tongue must be cut out. In the Ramayana, a Shudra (caste oppressed) who dared to practice yoga was murdered so that the sickly child of a priestly family might regain his health. In the Mahabharata, an Adivasi (South Asian Indigenous) boy is commanded to cut off his own thumb for the sin of being self-taught and skilled above his station. The pious are told that these obscene retributions maintain the divine order.Indian wisdom traditions have globalized to the extent that its evangelists have laundered the spiritualization of caste-based violence, and hidden its history from erstwhile progressives. Many of those evangelists have either been caste privileged, or caste apologists. The yoga they constructed for export has become a form of soft power, serving Hindu nationalist objectives.\u00A0 \u00A0The Trauma of Caste: A Dalit Feminist Meditation on Survivorship, Healing, and Abolition by Thenmozhi Soundararajan puts this history under a microscope. It pulls back the curtain on the carceral impacts of terms like dharma and karma, and concepts like purity, pollution, and reincarnation. In terms of our work here at Conspirituality, Soundararajan\u0027s text cuts through the romantic Orientalism used by influencers, cult leaders, and nationalists to exploit emotional vulnerabilities. It also points to\u2014and updates\u2014a vision of spiritual practice first articulated by the Dalit leader B. R. Ambedkar, rooted in the ancient Buddhist call to compassion and equality.

The book explores how this be facilitated within the context of journaling, writing poetry, and writing memoir, and what the therapeutic benefits of full confessional articulation can be.While countless people affirm that this book was a lifeline during a time in which recovery resources for child abuse survivors were rare,\u00A0 there are substantial problems with the book\u0027s method, claims about memory, dodgy sources, and endorsement of outright Satanic Panic propaganda.

We then explore the front matter: how Pazder introduces his project (and himself), and the ambivalent endorsement of Remi de Roo, Archbishop of Victoria. In Pazder\u0027s many clerical alliances, a crucial theme is established: the rapprochement between psychiatry and the priesthood, in which the former submits to the latter to restore the reality of the supernatural.We also look at the pre-emptively defensive\u00A0 intro penned by the publisher, Thomas B. Congdon Jr. He claimed to have verified the substance of the book through interviews, and thought that Pazder and Smith were very earnest and forthcoming people when he hosted them for editorial meetings.

Joining the panel are Peter Staudenmaier, professor of modern Germany history at Marquette, and Rebecca Carter-Chand, historian at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.

Humbled by a recent quantum download, we realize that we have for too long been relying on our critical faculties. For too long we have insisted that words mean things. Our poisoned irony has calcified our throat chakras and burned your ears to the point you may never trust a spiritual influencer again. Today we release our addiction to meaning, our fetish for precision in words. We begin to trust the inner babbler of heart-language. We hearken to the oracles, the speakers in tongues, the oompa loompa doompety doos, the glossalalics who trimper the ainions with seedgly refurns. Our hope is that with their help, we can begin to scrize the colong of wolfile stenoses.But we cannot enter this new world of activated communication alone.

We spend a lot of time eviscerating bog-standard hypocrisy in the economy of spirituality. Listeners resonate with this, but the project is also depressing, and in the parasocial contract they form with us, finding out that we still believe in something, or that something still provides relief\u2014this becomes important.

      "description": "What is the state\u00A0 of the documentary film in the age of manipulative online propaganda? In the hands and eyes of a documentarian like Amy Berg we find a journalistic commitment to the truth combined with the artistry of compelling and intimate story-telling.\u00A0 Along the way, her projects are guided by an obsession with\u00A0 justice. In two cases\u2014that of the West Memphis Three, and more recently the murder trial of Adnen Syed\u2014 her film-making played a role in changing the real-world narrative; leading to the release of those wrongfully convicted via cultural bias, moral panic, and conspiracy theories. In other instances Amy\u0027s work has embodied investigative journalism to show how real conspiracies hide the awful abuse of innocents, while protecting the powerful. We ask her how she measures her instincts against the evidence, how she gains the trust of people who have been ignored for decades, how she managed to log days of interview time with an abusive ex-priest, and how she keeps her mental health intact amidst all the uncertainty. In This Week in Conspirituality, Matthew covers an example of the co-optation of trauma-informed jargon by women in the land of the Three Percenters.

Girl, Interrupted is a freewheeling adaptation of a 1993 memoir by Susanna Kaysen about the 18 months she spent undergoing treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder in a Massachusetts psychiatric facility in the late 1960s.This study is provoked by a memory recounted by Swan\u0027s childhood friend, Diana Hansen Ribera, that Swan identified with the character of Lisa Rowe in the film. Angelina Jolie won an Oscar for her searing performance of Rowe, a sociopath. In this second episode, we explore several characters that Swan may have (and may yet) identify with, discuss the awkwardness of portraying mental health narratives on the big screen, and what it would really take for such an intense film to be digestible for typical teenagers. Matthew ends with a meditation on immersive/claustrophobic media\u2014which Swan goes on to master\u2014compared with the relief of developing a meta-view capable of inhabiting many stories, as opposed to imitating one.Show NotesSENECA THE YOUNGER, HERCULES FURENS - Theoi Classical Texts Library Hercules (Seneca)Girl, Interrupted \u2014 Susanna Kaysen1607: Growing up with Teal Swan - Diana Hansen RiberaMad, Bad, and Sad: Women and the Mind Doctors by Lisa AppignanesiBrittany Murphy: Inside Her Sudden Death at 32 That Still Confounds Hollywood -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

Julian talks with him about the Hobbit-fetish of new Italian PM and heir to Mussolini, Giorgia Meloni, as well as the American right\u2019s obsession with the Templar Knights, and the troubling midterm election trend of open White Christian Nationalism.

      "description": "There\u0027s no Teal Swan without the Satanic Panic. And there\u0027s no Satanic Panic without the 1980 publication of Michelle Remembers, by Lawrence Pazder and Michelle Smith.In this first of three segments on this melted book, Matthew and Julian cover its historical, cultural, and mass media context. We start with a review of a 1985 20/20 episode called \u201CThe Devil Worshippers\u201D for a taste of how mainstream outlets hosted cranks like Pazder, giving him a hall pass on evidence, and overlooking how his Catholic fetishes and paranoias played a huge role in the fictions he spun. The post Vatican 2 context is crucial, especially as we bear witness to the current political triumphs of Trad-Cath propaganda and politics in our post-Roe, QAnon -fried world. For help, we look to an excellent essay by social historian Bernard Doherty about the genre and elements of the Catholic Horror Film, which begins with Rosemary\u0027s Baby in 1968. This reactionary genre attempted to respond to modernizing\u2014or postmodernizing, as Jordan Peterson might say\u2014changes in Church doctrine. Bottom line? The Satanic Panic largely begins in and is sustained by Catholic-flavoured conspirituality anxiety about secularization, sex, babies, and abortion.

He weighs evidence from this field, which looks at the real societal and political causes of wealth disparity, against the metaphysical bullshit that proponents of the \u201Cmindset creates wealth\u201D uber-text, A Course in Miracles, try to sell you.Show NotesWhy we shouldn\u2019t push a positive mindset on those in povertyThe Causal Effects of Place on Health and Longevity -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "Some of the most valuable material that come to us from Paula Marino\u0027s Open Shadow film of 2017 is an extended interview with Swan\u0027s parent\u0027s, the Bosworths. They speak about Swan\u0027s sensory sensitivity as a young child, and how that morphed into a staunchly independent but sometimes isolated social life. They describe Swan\u0027s secret runic writing, their belief in her capacities as a medical intuitive, and discuss the gaps in psychiatric care that failed them all when her mental health needed help. This episode examines this interview, and then cross-checks some aspects against the account of Swan\u0027s childhood friend, Diana Hansen Ribera.Here we have the unique insight into parents speaking vulnerably and transparently about their baffling child\u2014which means we can really lean into the primal material that pre-exists the charged questions about whether Teal Swan is\u00A0 running a cult or encouraging suicide. What we find, between the accounts of the Bosworths and Ribera, is a collection of commonplace phenomena: high sensitivity, parents learning as they go, the intrusion of internet pornography, and a likely abusive figure who was too close to the family.In this episode, Matthew and Julian discuss the mystery of familial memory, idealizing vs. pathologizing children, the appeals of fantasy as a mode of relief, whether the Satanic Panic was a collective cry for help to resolve commonplace domestic and community abuse, and the possibility that cult formation is a social form of post traumatic play.

What if we told you that cannabis will catapult your chakras into higher consciousness\u2014all it costs is a $5,000 retreat entry fee, not including airfare and hotel? In the $4.4 trillion wellness industry, is any cost really too expensive to achieve true self-care\u2014even if it never really seems like you arrive anywhere at all?Rina Raphael was getting burnt out as a millennial digital news producer at NBC News. And so she did what anyone would do: she moved to Los Angeles in search of that self-care. Yet she could never shake her journalistic chops, and so she ended up writing about the wellness industry for the NY Times, the LA Times, Fast Company, and other publications. Her skeptical eye and earnest curiosity lead her to write her brand new book, The Gospel of Wellness: Gyms, Gurus, Goop, and the False Promise of Self-Care. And she\u2019s here this week to talk to us this week about her adventures in modern spirituality\u2014its teachings as well as its traps.

      "description": "On May 31st, 2014, Morgan Geyser stabbed her onetime best friend Bella Leutner nineteen times, while her new best friend, Anissa Weier, looked on. All three girls were twelve years old.\u00A0 Geyser was living with schizophrenia, and Weier had introduced her to the crowd-sourced internet phantasm known as Slenderman, who first appeared on Something Awful, the message board at the root of chan culture. Together, Geyser and Weier came to believe that Slenderman was demanding a sacrifice in exchange for his protection. Their crime,\u00A0 at once na\u00EFve and brutal,\u00A0 sparked a moral panic. Author Kathleen Hale joins Matthew to discuss her reporting on this story in her riveting and compassionate new book, Slenderman: Online Obsession, Mental Illness, and the Violent Crime of Two Midwestern Girls.Slenderman is brimming with tenderness for these girls, who are all creative, confused, scared, and ultimately bound to each other through social contagion and mental illness. Hale\u0027s writing is accessible but elliptical as it uncovers jagged details, but never easy answers, about a world that predicts our own.\u00A0 On this podcast we spend a lot of time on the virtual demons that animate conspirituality and QAnon, driving some devotees to violence. Hale\u0027s work is good medicine for those who know that internet chaos and mental precarity will remain locked in feedback loops for the foreseeable future. Her meticulous investigation\u2014enriched by hours spent interviewing Morgan Geyser\u2014shows that the road to understanding is always paved with empathy.

Is Goop\u2019s $295 incense holder a sign of feminine empowerment or merely another Gwneth Paltrow grift? Will that $32 spin class that features an endless litany of positive affirmations make you more likely to slip $5 to the homeless person camped outside of the studio\u2014or does it increase your happiness or contentment levels at all, once the endorphins wear off?These are just some of the questions posed by CTZNWELL founder, Kerri Kelly, in her new book, American Detox: The Myth of Wellness and How We Can Truly Heal. Beginning with her own transformational moment after 9/11, Kerri has long asked difficult questions of both herself and the industry she\u2019s spent decades immersed in. In fact, while Derek and Julian were co-founding the Conspirituality pre-cursor, YogaBrains, over a decade ago, Kerri was an integral member of yoga-activist organization, Off the Mat, Into the World.

      "description": "The homestretch of our study of Michelle Remembers zeroes in on the literal symbols\u2014and symbols gone literal\u2014of the Satanic Panic. Archetypes, gore, anxieties about sex and babies and filth: Lawrence Pazder mined it all, using modes of abstraction and dehumanization as old as religion itself to weave a story he claimed was all about Michelle\u2014but was really an exercise of his own fetishes.Michelle Smith could have received proper care for her understandable stresses. She could have offered up her feelings and sensations and images from dreams for discussion and contemplation, and an actual therapist would have held that material safely for her to explore. But in Pazder, Smith found someone who wasn\u2019t interested in common human complexity. He was interested in cosmic warfare, and the role he could LARP within it.But Pazder was so blind to his craven narcissism that he couldn\u2019t help but tell on himself. In the final passage we analyze, Pazder records Smith demanding to end therapy. \u201CIf I could tear out my tongue,\u201D she says, \u201CI would never have to speak again.\u201D But in the very next paragraph, the man who is forcing her to \u201Cremember\u201D symbolically tears out her tongue, rejecting her plea to end the sessions, interpreting her demand as though it were coming from Satan himself.She imagines herself getting in a car and driving and driving, anywhere. Away from this psychiatrist who wanted to be an exorcist, away from his story, perhaps to find her own.

      "description": "Fitness is the beating heart of America. No, wait, that\u2019s opportunistic capitalism. But opportunistic capitalism, as it turns out, is the beating heart of fitness. Yet fitness has a soul too\u2014in fact, mysticism, capitalism, and fitness have been dancing together for a very long time, while politics calls the tune, as historian and assistant professor at The New School, Natalia Petrzela, is here to tell us about today. We should also note that Natalia is our only four-time guest.She\u2019s also the author of an incredible new book, to be published this December by the University of Chicago Press, titled Fit Nation: The Gains and Pains of America\u2019s Exercise Obsession. The book spans over a hundred years, chronicling shifting cultural attitudes, gendered expectations, political inflections, and jackpot innovations in how Americans have celebrated, reviled, bought, sold, and been turned-on or enlightened by rituals of exercise.Like us, Natalia loves physical culture, but contradictions abound in the collisions between embodiment, politics, and commerce. If, as the marketing has told us over the years, recreational running is better for the mind than psychotherapy, moonlit naked hottubing at Esalen can save the world, women can simultaneously embrace dance studio fitness as a path of feminist liberation and a way to titilate the male gaze, and yoga can promise freedom from ever needing drugs or surgery, is it any wonder that a country so obsessed with exercise is so notoriously unhealthy?Show NotesFit Nation: The Gains and Pains of America\u2019s Exercise ObsessionFrom Performance to Participation: The Origins of the Fit NationWorking On The Work of Working Out: A history of fitness in America -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "In this episode of the Swan Song Series, Matthew interviews Paola Marino about why she found Teal Swan a fascinating subject to film for 2018\u2019s \u201COpen Shadow.\u201D They discuss aesthetics, the mystery of personality, why Swan\u2019s parents agreed to sit down with her. Matthew also surprised her with the newly-revealed translations of Swan\u2019s coded journal pages.Prefacing the interview is a discussion between Julian and Matthew about art, artifice, the risks of doing and not doing hard journalism on the subjects we cover. They discuss James Joyce\u2019s proverb about noble art, in which he describes \u201Caesthetic arrest\u201D as the middle way between propaganda and pornography.Marino\u2019s work attempts to find that path, while Jon Kasbe\u2019s The Deep End falters to both sides. On one hand Kasbe\u2019s film titillates viewers with high drama. On the other hand it tells viewers what they should think. And in both cases it creates a story where the truth would suffice.The feelings excited by improper art are kinetic, desire or loathing. Desire urges us to possess, to go to something; loathing urges us to abandon, to go from something. These are kinetic emotions. The arts which excite them, pornographical or didactic, are therefore improper arts. The esthetic emotion (I use the general term) is therefore static. The mind is arrested and raised above desire and loathing. \u2014James Joyce, Portrait of the Artist as a Young ManShow Notes Open Shadow\u2014Paola MarinoGizmodo Launches \u0027The Gateway,\u0027 an Investigative Podcast About a Controversial Internet Spiritual Guru -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

We then explore the front matter: how Pazder introduces his project (and himself), and the ambivalent endorsement of Remi de Roo, Archbishop of Victoria. In Pazder\u0027s many clerical alliances, a crucial theme is established: the rapprochement between psychiatry and the priesthood, in which the former submits to the latter to restore the reality of the supernatural. We also look at the pre-emptively defensive\u00A0 intro penned by the publisher, Thomas B. Congdon Jr. He claimed to have verified the substance of the book through interviews, and thought that Pazder and Smith were very earnest and forthcoming people when he hosted them for editorial meetings.

Well, not exactly, but that doesn\u2019t mean the varying sets of practices have not made an impact in China and abroad.This week, historian Tamara Venit-Shelton joins the podcast to talk to Derek about the history of Chinese Medicine in America. The author of Herbs and Roots: A History of Chinese Doctors in the American Medical Marketplace, they discuss the xenophobia and racism that Chinese encountered in the 19th century West, how early Chinese doctors used the exoticism of their system to their advantage when advertising to disaffected Americans who were suspicious of the dominant health care system, the moment that these varying practices became unified by Chairman Mao in the middle of the 20th century, and how the acupuncture needles we use today are not actually Chinese in origin\u2014we can thank the Japanese for the world\u2019s recent widespread adoption of that practice.

And there\u0027s no Satanic Panic without the 1980 publication of Michelle Remembers, by Lawrence Pazder and Michelle Smith.In this first of three segments on this melted book, Matthew and Julian cover its historical, cultural, and mass media context. We start with a review of a 1985 20/20 episode called \u201CThe Devil Worshippers\u201D for a taste of how mainstream outlets hosted cranks like Pazder, giving him a hall pass on evidence, and overlooking how his Catholic fetishes and paranoias played a huge role in the fictions he spun. The post Vatican 2 context is crucial, especially as we bear witness to the current political triumphs of Trad-Cath propaganda and politics in our post-Roe, QAnon -fried world. For help, we look to an excellent essay by social historian Bernard Doherty about the genre and elements of the Catholic Horror Film, which begins with Rosemary\u0027s Baby in 1968. This reactionary genre attempted to respond to modernizing\u2014or postmodernizing, as Jordan Peterson might say\u2014changes in Church doctrine.Bottom line? The Satanic Panic largely begins in and is sustained by Catholic-flavoured conspirituality anxiety about secularization, sex, babies, and abortion.Show NotesMichael Hobbes and Sarah Marshall cover Michelle Remembers with great skill. \u002220/20\u0022 the Devil Worshippers - May 16, 1985West of Memphis movie review \u0026 film summary (2012) | Roger EbertMel Gibson: The man without a pope - Where Peter IsThe Smoke of Satan on the Silver Screen: The Catholic Horror Film, Vatican II, and the Revival of Demonology | Journal for the Academic Study of Religion -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

When ordinary solutions and institutions are not trusted, we may reach for talismanic help; crystals, herbal remedies, ritual prayer and magical thinking, or we might consult the charismatic oracle who channels prophecies from the Great Beyond\u2014right on your iPhone. But what about weaponry? Even though guns exert devastating real-world impact, our guest argues that they also carry an important\u00A0 symbolic power. While most may never use it, the knowledge that cold hard steel is nearby is one attempt at managing an anxiety that is all-too human. In fact, coping strategies both magical and militaristic are woven into the American political psyche\u2014and as the pandemic has demonstrated, flare up dramatically during social crises; even at times becoming strange bedfellows. Philosophy and religion professor Alan Levinovitz calls this \u0022empowerment epistemology\u0022 and describes it as a connective tissue between the seemingly distant domains of gun culture and the wellness sphere. In both cases, this longing for empowerment in the face of helplessness motivates us to cleave to what we believe protects us, regardless of evidence to the contrary\u2014or the tragic consequences in our middle schools and medical ICUs.

      "description": "Some of the most valuable material that comes to us from Paula Marino\u0027s Open Shadow film of 2017 is an extended interview with Swan\u0027s parent\u0027s, the Bosworths. They speak about Swan\u0027s sensory sensitivity as a young child, and how that morphed into a staunchly independent but sometimes isolated social life. They describe Swan\u0027s secret runic writing, their belief in her capacities as a medical intuitive, and discuss the gaps in psychiatric care that failed them all when her mental health needed help. This episode examines this interview, and then cross-checks some aspects against the account of Swan\u0027s childhood friend, Diana Hansen Ribera.Here we have the unique insight into parents speaking vulnerably and transparently about their baffling child\u2014which means we can really lean into the primal material that pre-exists the charged questions about whether Teal Swan is\u00A0 running a cult or encouraging suicide. What we find, between the accounts of the Bosworths and Ribera, is a collection of commonplace phenomena: high sensitivity, parents learning as they go, the intrusion of internet pornography, and a likely abusive figure who was too close to the family. In this episode, Matthew and Julian discuss the mystery of familial memory,\u00A0 idealizing vs. pathologizing children, the appeals of fantasy as a mode of relief, whether the Satanic Panic was a collective cry for help to resolve commonplace domestic and community abuse, and the possibility that cult formation is a social form of post traumatic play.

Sam has written for the NY Times and the Washington Post, where he recently published an expose on Christiane Northrup. Derek asks him about this story in particular, as well as his process of reporting on religion, the differences between spirituality and religion, and the coming post-pandemic spirituality surge\u2014and how conspiritualists are already monetizing it.Show NotesChristiane Northrup, once a New Age health guru, now spreads covid disinformationLife After Proclaiming a Trump Re-election As Divinely OrdainedGodspeak Calvary Church Defies Quarantine, Attendance Soars -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "In this episode of the Swan Song Series, Matthew interviews Paola Marino about why she found Teal Swan a fascinating subject to film for 2018\u2019s \u201COpen Shadow.\u201D They discuss aesthetics, the mystery of personality, why Swan\u2019s parents agreed to sit down with her. Matthew also surprised her with the newly-revealed translations of Swan\u2019s coded journal pages.Prefacing the interview is a discussion between Julian and Matthew about art, artifice, the risks of doing and not doing hard journalism on the subjects we cover. They discuss James Joyce\u2019s proverb about\u00A0 noble art, in which he describes \u201Caesthetic arrest\u201D as the middle way between propaganda and pornography. Marino\u2019s work attempts to find that path, while Jon Kasbe\u2019s The Deep End falters to both sides. On one hand Kasbe\u2019s film titillates viewers with high drama. On the other hand it tells viewers what they should think. And in both cases it creates a story where the truth would suffice. The feelings excited by improper art are kinetic, desire or loathing. Desire urges us to possess, to go to something; loathing urges us to abandon, to go from something. These are kinetic emotions. The arts which excite them, pornographical or didactic, are therefore improper arts. The esthetic emotion (I use the general term) is therefore static. The mind is arrested and raised above desire and loathing. \u2014 James Joyce, Portrait of the Artist as a Young ManShow NotesOpen Shadow\u2014Paola MarinoGizmodo Launches \u0027The Gateway,\u0027 an Investigative Podcast About a Controversial Internet Spiritual Guru -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "Our guest today, Jennings Brown, is a bright light in an increasingly chaotic cult-content economy. His 2018 podcast on Teal Swan, The Gateway, produced with Gizmodo, sets a high-watermark standard for research, fairness, and sensitivity. A lot has happened since that pod dropped: #MeToo, MAGA, QAnon, COVID, and now a post-reality Supreme Court in which Justice Thomas publishes a concurrence in which he states that COVID vaccines use the tissues of aborted fetuses. All of which is to say: we don\u2019t know how intensely the insanity of the era will escalate, but we do know that clear, ethical reporting on difficult issues is a very thin lifeline back to sanity, communication, and trying to do something.If you listened to episode 109 (if you haven\u2019t we encourage you to stop here and go there), you\u2019ll hear our criticisms of The Deep End docuseries about Teal Swan. You\u2019ll hear us interview the director, Jon Kasbe. We lean on him, maybe too gently, on the numerous integrity issues with his film. Bottom line: with deceptive edits and a vacuum of expert commentary and research, we feel that this project is a real setback for everyone trying to understand cultic dynamics in the online age. And as we\u2019ll report at the top of the show, before our interview with Brown, the story of this embedment is only getting messier.Our interview with Jennings steers clear of the muck, because what we really wanted to hear was all about his process, his editorial decisions, and the help he got from his producers. We were also very lucky to have him drop some previously unreported data into the mix. Spoiler alert: it\u2019s about the types of things that Swan used to write in her secret runic alien language.Show NotesJennings Brown \u2014 About page with tip line contact infoEpisode 109: Who\u0027s Afraid of Teal Swan? w/ Jon KasbeJon Kasbe wishing Teal Swan happy birthdayBits Sola rapping Teal Swan happy birthdayGizmodo Launches \u0027The Gateway,\u0027 an Investigative Podcast About a Controversial Internet Spiritual GuruOpen Shadow \u2014 Paola MarinoPaola Marino on The Deep End (clip)Jennings Brown \u2014 Revelations -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

This is the bread and butter of Swan\u0027s technique, with the result being that many of her close followers come to tell stories\u00A0 about their childhoods that echo hers. Swan\u0027s own story of childhood abuse crystallized after she goes through treatment with a leading Satanic Panic therapist, Barbara Snow. Those are stories on the page. But today, to kick off the Swan Song Series, Julian shares\u00A0 the moment-by-moment mechanics of how this disastrous parody of therapy turned his own life inside out, and alienated him from his family for a decade.Content warning for listeners: we\u2019ll be talking about stories of child sexual abuse.Show NotesThe Gateway Michelle Remembers, covered by Sarah Marshall and Michael Hobbes Forrest Yoga students ask A.

      "description": "If the world has become too much to bear\u2014and the bots know it from your search history\u2014 you will likely find Teal Swan. She will appear, an angel of the algorithms, part icon and part anime avenger. Against a backdrop of flowing water or turning constellations, she will gaze into your despair. She will speak in a drone at once hypnotic and relieving, giving words to feelings you thought were taboo. At 3am, this might feel like mystical luck, but it\u2019s no accident. Swan is open about recruiting suicidal seekers to her content, and she has the tech chops to do it.Now, with Jon Kasbe\u2019s series, \u201CThe Deep End\u201D airing on Hulu, Swan has entered some A-list limelight. But what do we really learn from this docutainment event, radiating out from an embedment in Swan\u2019s inner circle? According to Kasbe\u2019s own words, we don\u2019t learn the \u201CCapital T Truth\u201D of Swan\u2019s day-to-day, but rather the immersive feeling of what it is like to be under her spell. Or do we? Swan accuses Kasbe of casting his own spell, with deceptive editing that scrambles timelines and conflates interactions, and even different people. And it appears she might not be wrong. We talk to Kasbe in this episode about his vision and blindspots, and the ironic risk of creating a film of Satanic-Panic level false memories about an influencer who says she specializes in retrieving past trauma. This episode will pilot a series of Patreon bonus episodes in which we\u2019ll study the Teal Swan spectacle in detail, and how important it is to not only report on it well, but to be fair to an influencer like Swan and her dedicated followers, lest they lose even more trust in the real\u00A0 world.CORRECTION: Matthew referred to Jennings Brown\u0027s role on The Deep End production incorrectly during the episode.

Hundreds of videos in a series called \u201CThe Great Awakening.\u201D Christiane Northrup, the matriarch of New Age women\u2019s wellness, warns her followers about fake viruses, and tells them to avoid sex with their vaccinated partners. She stumps alongside QAnon celebrities, shovels campaign contributions to Trump, and dotes over sovereign citizen sheriffs. To ease your symptoms of ascension, she offers bath recipes of alfalfa greens and Dr. Bronner\u2019s soap. You can have a good soak and listen to her golden harp. But in this nowhere world, where oh where is Christiane Northrup? Who is she? Is she flesh and blood, or a social media hologram generated by a Louise Hay AI? Is that mansion she broadcasts from a sound stage, or is there real soil and manure and flowers there? Our guests today know Northrup as super-real, because they live in her home state of Maine. Alyce Ornella, Andy O\u2019Brien, and Mooncat have known her as a doctor, an MLM diva, antivax rabble rouser, and QAnon tour promoter. Now, they tell us, another Northrup may be crystallizing on Maine\u2019s rocky shore, floating past the lighthouses and over the cranberry bogs on a cloud of essential oils. She\u2019s been seen haunting the blueberry patches, wearing a chunky necklace of lobster claws.

This week, Matthew draws on his Catholic upbringing and experience as church organist (for close to 1,000 funerals) to help unpack this experience.\u00A0In hindsight, it turns out that the rote blandness of organized religion may serve communities more honestly than the monetized performative charisma of New Age ritual. The conversation touches on the mythological and social dimensions of religion, as well as both Julian and Matthew\u2019s experience of corporal punishment at school, meted out by the same authority figures who donned ceremonial robes for church. -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

He\u2019s come out and said so, in a bold but vague response to criticism of his content from our podcast. Matthew takes him at his word, and puts on his cult research hat to give some pointers on how Aubrey can avoid abusing his power. Key bits of advice include: rejecting high intensity recruitment techniques, not depicting the world outside Fit For Service as \u201Cupside down\u201D or insane, and not platforming alleged child molesters like Marc Gafni.While this open letter is addressed to Aubrey, his Fit For Service clients might also find it useful as they decide whether to keep spending up to 20K USD per year participating in the program. Also, if Aubrey feels that this episode contains information that will help current and future participants assess whether he is really making good on his promise to provide \u201Cradical self-sovereignty,\u201D we at Conspirituality Podcast would happily give permission for this episode to be included with Fit For Service materials, pro bono.This letter is also open in a broader sense, because it contains solid tips for all earnest charismatic influencers who want to improve their ethics game.

Their mom brought it into the house and their daily rhythms bit by bit.As kids in the early 1980s, they would fall asleep to visualizations by the self-help guru Wayne Dyer, on audiocassette. Or mom would read passages from Autobiography of a Yogi, by Paramahansa Yogananda, after tucking them into bed. Cortney remembers an eerie photograph of the yogi\u2019s corpse in a glass coffin in the mortuary. The lore was that he just wouldn\u2019t decay. \u201CMom had a real fascination with beating death,\u201D she told us.\u00A0When the girls were still in elementary school, mom took them to an \u201Cattunement\u201D, which must have made them the youngest Reiki Masters in Green Bay, Wisconsin\u2014if not the whole midwest. \u201CShe was on a search,\u201D Shana told us.\u00A0And at some point the local massage training, the flyers in the health food stores, and the mail-order books weren\u2019t enough. Mom started going to events, a long way from home\u2014all the way out in Washington State. One time she came home with a VHS tape and played it for the girls. It showed a woman named J.Z. Knight transform into someone she called \u201CRamtha,\u201D who she said was 35,000 years old, and carried the wisdom of the ages. She also brought audiocassettes of Ramtha, which they played in the car.\u00A0This was their introduction to \u201Cchanneling.\u201D They were young teens, and didn\u2019t know what to think. Was it magic? Was it funny? Ramtha sounded like the Great Gazoo, after all. When mom wasn\u2019t home they\u2019d show the VHS tape to their friends and giggle. But they also felt strange about it. Embarrassed.\u00A0\u201CI remember yelling at my mom, \u2018Why can\u0027t you be normal?\u2019\u201D Shana said. What they understand now is how much she desperately needed to find something that was meaningful.\u00A0\u201CShe was really struggling in the Catholic religion,\u201D Shana said, \u201CAnd her marriage,\u201D Cortney added. \u201CAnd midlife. It was the perfect storm.\u201D\u00A0Matthew sits down with Cortney and Shana as they share their story publicly for the first time.\u00A0 -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

Still fully convinced she was going to heal herself by sheer force of wishful thinking.\u201D We reached out, and Gavin agreed to an interview.Fey was 47 years old when she died under the coconut palms and stars of Ubud, with Gavin at her side. She\u2019d spent six years feverishly trying to keep ahead of breast cancer with alternative medicine and New Age spirituality. She received several turns of evidence-based care that had served her body well. But she would always return to the energy work, herbs, and meditations that spoke to her soul. Gavin was there with her all the way. He found himself stretched thin between advocating for treatments that worked, and honoring her need for magic. We\u0027re really grateful that he has shared this story with us.Show Notes Here\u0027s the full recording of Fey reciting \u0022Karuna Breath.\u0022 -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "In this conversation, Beatrice Adler-Bolton\u2014disability justice advocate and co-host of Death Panel Podcast\u2014says something twice:\u0022Under capitalism, you\u2019re only entitled to the survival you can buy.\u0022 Her forthcoming co-authored book is called, provocatively, Health Communism. Part of its argument is that we have to imagine a society in which everyone is entitled to the survival we can share.How disquieting it is that the natural instinct we have as individuals to ask:\u00A0 \u0022What is this going to cost me?\u0022 is microcosmic to neoliberal obsessions\u2014austerity, productivity, and dreams of a better future purchased with moral sacrifices in the present. It\u2019s microcosmic to the brutal decisions our societies are now making about who is worthy of protection and who isn\u0027t, and which political constituencies we can\u0027t afford to piss off by appealing to the small amount of generosity and humility it takes to wear a mask. We\u0027re living in a culture of What is it going to cost me? And that\u0027s not really a culture at all.If we don\u0027t do better, then how exactly are the conspiritualists wrong? Not about the details, but about the existential condition. They imagine a Cabal at the top of everything, making nefarious decisions, and this is easy to dismiss. Less easy to dismiss is the feeling they articulate, that many of us share: that unseen and impersonal forces are working against the spirit of human generosity. They know that sometimes we all feel ourselves participating in that process, which means we have to do something\u2014perhaps as radical as waking up. Not to the magic of turmeric, or the realization that we\u2019re starseeds. Something far more radical than that, and much more mundane: that we can organize ourselves in more fair and loving ways.Beatrice Adler-Bolton is a blind/low vision and chronically ill artist, writer, and disability justice advocate. Beatrice studies radical patient groups and the capitalist political economy of health as an independent researcher and is earning a master\u0027s in Disability Studies at CUNY. She is the co-host of the Death Panel podcast with Artie Vierkant and Phil Rocco.Note from Beatrice: If you\u0027d like to give your listeners a little more info on Disability Justice (DJ), I would recommend this link from Sins Invalid, which is a short and foundational DJ text and a really quick primer on what it is written by Patty Berne and Sins Invalid: tinyurl.com/DJ10Principles. -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "In July 2020, just as we were finding our sea legs with this podcast, Imran Ahmed joined to discuss the state of disinformation occurring around the world. As the founder of the UK\u2019s Center for Countering Digital Hate, he had just produced a report that found anti-vax organizations were reaching 58 million people on social media\u2014and this was well before the COVID vaccines were developed. The total amount of money spent by anti-vax groups and advertisers targeting their followers on Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube turned out to be roughly $1 billion.Imran\u2019s group kept reporting and we kept covering them. You probably remember the Center thanks to its Disinformation Dozen report, which profoundly impacted awareness of just how much anti-vax leaders were monetizing their supplements, seminars, and other supposed COVID \u201Cinterventions.\u201D The report even reached the White House where Joe Biden called out the Disinformation Dozen during a press conference.\u00A0What\u2019s changed in the nearly two years since we had Imran on? Well, a lot\u2014and in some ways, not much at all. Julian interviews Imran this time around after having met up in person at the Defeat the Mandates rally in downtown Los Angeles. Imran discusses what\u2019s changed, what hasn\u2019t, and how the bottom line remains the same: namely, the conspiritualist\u2019s bottom line. They also talk about the nature of free speech in an internet filled with disinformation.\u00A0Before hearing from Imran, Derek and Julian briefly discuss the state of disinformation and free speech online, which Derek frames in terms of urban planning and the concept of legibility.\u00A0 -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "Listeners: there\u2019s a revolution going on. Legions of Twitter counselors and Instagram therapists has risen up to offer unsolicited sermons on cults, cult leaders, and cult recovery. With COVID closing down the studios, every third yoga teacher has become an expert in trauma. They\u2019re starting Facebook groups. They\u2019re selling courses. They\u2019re doing their Family Systems work out in the open, displaying heroic levels of vulnerability. We\u2019re just waiting for the first QAnon recovery MLM to launch on Kickstarter.\u00A0 We know it\u2019s coming. There will be oils, and breathing exercises, and some very long emotional check-ins on Zoom.Meanwhile, Netflix is distinguishing itself from GaiaTV, the Netflix of cults, with an explosion of cult documentaries. There\u2019s a gold rush on. Scouts for all of the streaming companies are lined up outside of the ashrams, vetting survivors to see who has the chops to carry a series. We seem to love them, but sometimes not as much as the sociopaths themselves. The cult doc is the new true crime chill.Beneath the feeding frenzy, there\u2019s real work to be done. The QAnon Casualities subreddit has 235K followers as of today. We get dozens of emails and DMs from people who have had their lives upended by conspirituality and cults. We have hints and whispers to offer them, but no answers. Yes, we live in a capitalist hellscape in which emotional turmoil of the people is commodified and sold back to them in the form of workshops and bingeable series. But we are also able to host Rachel Bernstein, cult recovery therapist, to get some clarity on the basic phenomena that dominate our commons today.Program note: We\u2019re going to try to stretch this out to 90 minutes so that we can each say we got a 45-minute free consult on why TF we\u2019re doing this job. -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

Who is he? How do you take the measure of a Quantum Man? We\u2019ll shine our browsers into the slit experiment and observe a particle here, a wave there. The particles of video clips, the waves of affiliate links. We\u2019ll run our signature experiment: Schrodinger\u2019s Influencer, to find out just how many parallel Joe Dispenzas are populating the multiple universes he is trying to crack back to alignment with his chiropractic panache. There\u2019s the Joe of the Ramtha School of Enlightenment, Joe who starred in \u201CWhat The Bleep Do We Know?\u201D There\u2019s faith healer Joe, and Joe who now headlines, alongside David Icke, for the Netflix of conspirituality, Gaia TV.Joking aside: in episode 89, we heard from Mary, whose husband almost gave up on chemotherapy for aggressive pancreatic cancer under the influence of Placebo Joe. And today we\u2019ll watch him pretend to be able to cure infertility, and romance Aubrey Marcus. We\u2019ll also puzzle over his strangely undramatic origin story. We\u2019ll suss out the normalizing impact Joe has on a whole raft of bullshit.

As with Rogan, who he recently said he loved being compared to, Brand is amassing an increasingly large following\u2014trust us, he\u2019ll remind you of that number at the top of every episode\u2014thanks to his high-energy solo rants about the conspiracy of, well, seemingly everything. But what\u2019s Russell really saying? We\u2019ve listened to hours of his podcasts and watched further hours of videos and, to be honest, we can\u2019t really tell. Pseudo-spiritual musings mesh with benign revolutionary politicizing with a healthy dose of his live performance schedule and reminders to smash the subscribe button thrown in. Russell is exceptionally good at evoking emotions and firing listeners up with his high-energy, seemingly stream-of-consciousness diatribes, yet when you break down the sentences, you find that he\u2019s pretty content-free.

Initially floated in the 19th century, terrain theory was never\u00A0 proven in real-world experiments, and so fell dormant\u2014until now. As with many terrible 19th-century science metaphysics, conspiritualists are feeling nostalgic. And do we have a group to introduce you to this week.To help us debunk this funk, Dr Dan Wilson returns to the pod to offer his keen ear in breaking down the bullsh*t being shoveled by Tom Cowan and Andrew Kaufman during The Event 2021. First, Derek offers a brief history of the battle between germ theory and terrain theory\u2014one that produced a clear winner in Louis Pasteur, which, as conspiritualists now spin it, is just further evidence of the Deep State conspiracy holding us all back.

      "description": "The mystical politics of Aleksandr Dugin, the mercurial philosopher and geopolitical strategist hovering behind Vladimir Putin, is front and center this week.\u00A0 Last week, we covered the phenomenon of Western conspiritualists folding the Russian invasion of Ukraine into their fact-free claims about what\u0027s really going on. It turns out that once you\u0027re all-in on the cabal, the Great Reset, mole children, and vaccine genocide, whatever happens in the world means you were right all along. Conspiritualists are claiming that, just like Donald Trump, Putin is really a light worker fighting to save the children and destroy Anthony Fauci\u0027s secret bioweapons labs in Ukraine while heralding the true Great Awakening. But an entirely different prophecy, one promising a Soviet spiritual rebirth, appears to be inspiring Vladimir Putin\u0027s actions\u2014as well as Russia\u0027s disruptive interference in American politics. Julian unpacks the perennialist religious movement, Traditionalism, and how it speaks to fascist political actors around the world, including Steve Bannon. This is especially relevant in light of tragic events in Europe, a stark reminder of those of us who remember the Cold War. This time, Dugin and Putin dream of a new Russian Empire.Show NotesAleksandr Dugin Ukraine Invasion Press ConferenceMoscow Patriarch Stokes Religious Tensions with Ukraine RemarksDugin, Putin \u0026 The 2016 ElectionThe Rise of Traditionalism by Benjamin TeitelbaumSteve Bannon\u2019s Ideological SoulmateDugin Fired from University Post for Inciting GenocideThe London Dinner that Brought Europe\u2019s Far-Right TogetherBannon Cites Julius EvolaInside The Strange Origins of Bannon\u2019s Nationalist FantasiaDugin\u2019s Foundations of Geopolitics ReviewedDugin\u2019s Eurasianism \u0026 The Am -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "A few weeks ago, you couldn\u2019t turn to a social media platform without seeing that Joe Rogan was trending. The diversity of topics boggled the mind: COVID disinformation; misogyny, pseudoscience; transphobia; and, of course, racism, thanks to the infamous N-word mixtape. Then a parallel argument came through: fair pay for musicians on Spotify. Given that Rogan was given $100 million for his podcasting contract\u2014a number we\u2019d later find out was closer to $200 million\u2014the economic discussion brought another dimension into the conversation. But given all of the topics being discussed, which dimension should we have focused on?That thought led Derek to write a series of tweets on the topic, followed by a more in-depth Substack article contemplating the three main issues of concern: scientific misinformation, racism, and fair pay. The tweets led to a lot of pushback, which we\u2019ll be looking at through the lens of conversation and debate, as well as a 2021 Pew Research poll on American political typologies. It also led to today\u2019s guests\u2014infectious disease epidemiologist and science communicator, Jessica Malaty Rivera, and civic product leader and community activist, Daniel Latorre\u2014offering their own views on the topics, first on social media, then here on the podcast. But first, we\u2019ll discuss the implications of intersectionality and progressive politics in a world in which social media can distort as much as it amplifies. Matthew will dish on how much he loathes everything Joe Rogan stands for, and why\u2014but also wonders about how pragmatic his seething hatred is, or could be.Just a note before we begin. Between our last episode\u2014in which Julian caught up with Sara Aniano and dappergander on current events in the QAnon world\u2014and today, Russia has invaded Ukraine, and all of the news is terrible and terrifying. Since the first rockets hit, we\u2019ve been monitoring how conspirituality influencers are responding, and we\u2019ll bring you that data next week, as it continues to show the adaptability of the movement and the willingness of its influencers to say literally anything to remain at the center of the attention and outrage economy.Show NotesJoe Rogan: We are in Kali YugaJoe Rogan shares Sadhguru: \u201CIt is fashionable to suffer\u201DMatthew Sheffield on Right-Left \u201Cbalance\u201D on Rogan.McInnes appearance on Rogan \u201Cinstrumental\u201D to Proud Boys\u2019 growth: Rolling StoneBeyond Red vs. Blue: The Political TypologyRace \u0026 Class at Spotify -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "When Stephanie Sibbio, owner of Glowing Mama Fitness in Toronto, livestreamed herself harassing workers in her local health food store over COVID policy, the world was introduced to a now-familiar archetype: the petulant anti-masker who cares as little about science as she does about others. Sibbio has since developed this role with gusto, becoming a minor celebrity in the Canadian antivax movement. Recently, she threw her support behind the Occupation of Ottawa.But everyone comes from somewhere: a family, a network, a circle. Beneath a persona hardened by the social media spectacle, there\u2019s a person to be known, remembered, and perhaps welcomed back. Today Matthew sits down with four friends who have known and loved Stephanie since junior high school. They share stories of the bonds they nurtured growing up, and how quickly and violently antivax ideology and social media smashed their circle. An honest and transparent discussion about the emotional and social costs of conspirituality. Show NotesGlowing Mama Anti-Masker.

It shows a little boy, clearly stressed, sitting in the cab of an expensive black pickup truck with the window open, holding his ears against the incredible noise of the air horns as his mother takes a triumphant pan-shot video of a convoy rally.  The clip encapsulates the surreal chaos of a deceptive, astroturfed, funded-from-outside, social-media-driven catastrophe that is right in line with the worst of the conspirituality world. A torrent of misinformation, co-opted trauma, and \u201Cfreedom-fighters\u201D LARPing, in which children are weaponized by super-pilled parents, in which we can witness the cycles of social neglect and psychic violence turning in real time.  We open today with a review of the Occupation of Ottawa and what we know so far, and a discussion of how our conspirituality friends are co-opting and distorting events in ways that are not only craven, but will increase the chances that this event will end in violence. Finally, Matthew interviews Elizabeth Simons of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network on the deep background, the big picture, and the horizon.

      "description": "Mary joins Matthew for an extended interview about the last year of her husband\u2019s life. Louis died of pancreatic cancer almost exactly a year ago, at the age of 45. Mary\u2014who has asked that her last name be kept off the record for privacy concerns\u2014loved him and cared for him throughout that journey. It was hard, not only for the reasons we all share, but because Louis spent his last months under the influence of quantum chiropractor Joe Dispenza. At one crucial point, he was on the verge of stopping his chemotherapy treatment, believing that a Dispenza meditation technique might be more effective. Mary is an Applied Psychologist with a science background and an evidence-based mindset. She didn\u2019t share Louis\u2019s beliefs or ideals, and at points was terrified that his death would be hastened by conspirituality. But of course, she loved and served him nonetheless. And it seems he had a good death, perhaps blessed by beliefs that made Mary wonder if they might provide relief for her as well. If we\u2019ve learned one thing over the course of this project, it\u2019s that we\u2019ll be living and dying together for a long time at the crossroads of data and imagination, science and spirituality, evidence and the unknown. We\u2019re grateful that Mary has shared this love story of how she navigated it all.

While it\u2019s debatable how much good chiropractic adjustments are doing for your body\u2014there\u2019s some evidence that it alleviates lower back pain, alongside a litany of unsubstantiated claims\u2014what\u2019s not debatable is the number of anti-vax, pseudoscience-prone chiropractors clogging the conspirituality pipeline these days.This isn\u2019t a \u201Cchiropractor takedown\u201D episode, as both Derek and Julian have benefited from treatments in the past.

Yet there\u2019s a strong conspiritualist lean among a number of chiropractors and we want to know why. To that end, Derek offers a history of the practice, which is, perhaps unsurprisingly, rooted in an anti-vax, anti-medicine strain of 19th-century vitalism. Julian discusses some of his experiences while Matthew questions consent and harm in the industry.

      "description": "Inspired by a recent discussion on psychoanalysis and politics with Pat Blanchfield on Know Your Enemy, this brief meditation focuses on two aspects of the conspirituality landscape that have lurked in the unconscious of the pod:  People do not make sense. There are conflicting impulses and voices within us all. One objective of our project is akin to the goal psychoanalysis: to get those parts talking.\u00A0  Calling people hypocrites for not making sense is a terrible way of getting them to make sense. What we call hypocrisy, they have used for coherence and survival. The blowback isn\u0027t stubbornness, but a confession of needs.  Matthew looks at how the contradictions of Kelly Brogan and JP Sears make sense. Brogan rails against \u0022mommy medicine\u0022 while installing herself as \u0022mommy shaman.\u0022 Sears tells us \u0022Don\u0027t outsource your truth,\u0022 while he absorbs data from Bitchute and Rogan. Brogan\u0027s followers are attracted by the simultaneous rejection and reconstitution of authority. JP Sears is a hollow husk of a man, telling his followers to look inside. But when you meet a contradiction or a defence that is harmful, you can\u2019t just argue it away. You have to work towards a better answer to the condition the defence is trying to ease.Show NotesFreud and Politics (w/ Pat Blanchfield) -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

But what of this court? Matthew\u2019s scene by scene analysis of some prime Marcus marketing porn will give us some clues. The video in question is for Marcus\u2019s life-coaching programme, which is called \u201CFit for Service.\u201D The visuals centre around what looks like a haka ritual dance, through which customers release their inner warriors, nurture their affiliate links and jazz up their socials. On point for the influencer age, the ritual plays out in a narcissistic hall of mirrors, choreographed for performance by programme participants in order to promote the programme they are performing in. Naturally, Matthew will be using the analytical frameworks of spectacle and simulation from Guy Debord and Jean Baudrillard to make sense of it. He\u2019ll also apply Renato Rosaldo\u2019s concept of \u201Cimperialist nostalgia\u201D to explore the ugly conflicts in Marcus\u2019s indigenous cosplay.Show NotesFit for Service homepagefit.for.service:\u00A0 A Dandelion In A Field Is Un-killableA poet\u2019s plea to save our planet | IN-Q | TED Institute \u0022Revolution\u0022: The FORGOTTEN Voices of The Pandemic Will Have You In TearsThe 5 Desires: Marcus on FFS promises Aubrey Marcus - Fit For Service Mastermind - Review \u2013 Max HugThe Wellness Pornographers.

      "description": "Up to this point, we\u2019ve understood Charles Eisenstein as the poet-philosopher of conspirituality, lending his Burning Man ritual workshop chops to the antivax faux-freedom movement. Out of deference to his apparent sensitivity and respectable writing skills, we\u2019ve given him the benefit of the doubt\u2014we even invited him on this show for two episodes to see whether we could find common ground. We didn\u2019t.In our last Bonus episode, Julian tracked how Eisenstein has accelerated and intensified his rhetoric. Today, we\u2019ll see how he\u2019s fortifying his money networks, and starting to say the quiet parts out loud. He\u2019s no longer \u201Cjust\u201D dog-whistling violence and QAnon. We\u2019re reviewing a recent video he\u2019s co-produced with Onnit multimillionaire and Austin bro-poet Aubrey Marcus. It\u2019s an anime rendition of the ending of his 2013 bestseller, The More Beautiful World Our Hearts Know is Possible. In the book, Eisenstein presents \u201CThe Gathering of the Tribe\u201D as a kind of personal mythology. As he levels up to the big leagues, this story about belonging to a group of blessed alien shamans sent to wake up humanity carries clear real-world literalness\u2014and a culty vibe. If the high-end video doesn\u2019t convince you, a tape from a hipster New Year\u2019s Eve party in Ithaca NY might do the trick. As he holds guru-court for All the Big Questions, Eisenstein tells an Iraq vet that he has special gifts to deploy against the (fictional) building of COVID concentration camps in Rhode Island. Then he says he hopes the \u201Cpedophile elite\u201D will just stop. Sound familiar?Eisenstein\u2019s content is poetic and vague. Its implications are plausibly deniable. It pours out through an endless stream of radiant and inscrutable essay drops. He has mastered the cryptic prompt that either speaks to your soul, to your appetite for disrupting public health, or to your recent tactical training regimen. Who can really tell? His skill is to stand beside and above it all. He can avoid being pinned down. It\u2019s almost as if he\u2019s not really there, but only reflecting the zeitgeist of our broken moment. It\u2019s time to just name him for what he is: New Age Q.Show NotesA Gathering of the Tribe | POWERFUL Short Film by Charles Eisenstein w/ Jon Hopkins \u0026 Aubrey MarcusA Gathering of the Tribe | Reality Sandwich (original, 2009)A Gathering of the Tribe (full version Charles\u2019s site)Interview with Charles Eisenstein | Inner World Press | Shift in Consciousness Ezine In the Miracle (Eisenstein essay, 2009)Charles Eisenstein at Resonance NYE The Man Behind th -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

Yoga International\u2014one of the largest yoga media companies in the world\u2014had been acquired by Gaia\u2014one of the largest pseudoscience, pseudointellectual, conspiracy theory platforms in the world. While the CEO of Yoga International immediately assured nervous content providers that the platform will remain editorially independent, only time will tell. What we do know is that countless print articles written by earnest yogis and thousands of hours of classes created by earnest yoga instructors will now share space with David Icke, an antisemitic conspiracy theorist who believes lizard people have coopted world governments\u2014and that\u2019s only the start. The acquisition predicts even more brain-melting in yogaland, exposing even more vulnerable and credulous seekers to a dumpster fire of meaning dressed up in a simulation of spirituality.

      "description": "In 1969, Swami Vishnudevananda pioneered what has become a life transition ritual for the GenX and Millennial precariat: the Yoga Teacher Training (YTT) Programme. He was a cult leader rapist who thought yoga would help the world understand messages sent by UFOs. Not exactly confidence-inspiring.Not every YTT programme is bad\u2014today\u0027s bonus host Matthew has worked in some good ones for over a decade. But on the whole, we\u0027re talking about an industry that has graduated up to 500K ppl over 50 years through a pseudo-educational process that has greased the epistemological pipeline towards conspirituality.YTTs are unregulated by any academic or professional consensus. They are driven by the anxious charisma of urban yoga studio entrepreneurs who need to sell big-ticket products to counter the rising overheads of the gentrification they\u0027re helping to drive. Their curricula offers a pastiche of uncited resources. They pad contact hours with sermons and meditation sessions.\u00A0The typical YTT training manual is an unironic postmodern meat-grinder in which Iron Age philosophy and high school anatomy are blended with quotes from Carl Jung and Rumi. As an example, Matthew looks at a Jivamukti Yoga School manual from a 2007 training hosted at Omega Institute.Again: not all YTTs are bad, or lead to QAnon. But the ritual and charismatic pedagogy that most offer has a lot in common with the sacrament of redpilling\u2014albeit more socially acceptable and aspirational.\u00A0Conspirituality went viral in 2020. It\u0027s time to ask whether the YTT industry compromised a culture\u0027s immunity to it. Show NotesHello, YogAnon!

      "description": "While Americans were transforming esoteric strains of yoga into a commodifiable industry in 1980, a young naval officer named Steve Bannon was picking up theosophical texts in metaphysical bookstores and practicing Zen meditation in secret while stationed in Hong Kong. He was wary of his countrymates liberal explorations of Eastern philosophies, aware of the nationalistic roots upon which these \u201Cmystical\u201D systems were founded. Then he stumbled into Traditionalism, a perennial philosophy that consumed all world religions, as popularized by the likes of French metaphysicist Ren\u00E9 Gu\u00E9non and Italian antisemitic conspiracy theorist Julius Evola.This week we welcome Benjamin Teitelbaum, an Assistant Professor of Ethnomusicology and International Affairs at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and author of the book, War for Eternity: The Return of Traditionalism and the Rise of the Populist Right. Teitelbaum gained access to leading right-wing figures around the world, including Steve Bannon. He\u2019s got their number and brings receipts.

      "description": "We\u0027ve talked a lot on this podcast about the selfie sermon: the kind of iPhone video native to Instagram influencers. Easily weaponized by conspiritualists, this sermon is equal parts intimate confessional, prophecy download, and motivational coaching, directly transmitted from your favorite self-anointed maverick expert. Social media seems perfectly designed for such hypnotic performances and spiritual darshans. But in the brick-and-mortar world, yoga teachers have long blurred the line between acting and teaching, space holding and theater, and ritual ceremony and fitness. If all the world\u0027s a stage, as Shakespeare had it, the wooden planks of the yoga studio\u2014and the digital platforms built in ether\u2014demand that teachers embrace a role, adopt a script, and sell a story to their audience. What we want to know is: where does the performance end and yoga begin, or perhaps more to the point, is there even a difference?Our guest host today is Jill Miller, who many listeners will know from her hugely influential body of work in yoga and movement as founder of Tune-Up Fitness. She\u0027s also a former actor, which played an important role in her transition to full-time yoga instructor. We\u0027re going to start today with an excerpt from her 2017 TED-style talk that she gave in Toronto titled, \u201CLights, Camera, Yoga.\u0022 -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "To prepare this curative episode, we listened carefully to alternative health consumers for many hours, taking an exhaustive history of life challenges on physical, mental, and emotional planes. We scanned the symptoms against our compendium of disease states and prescribed the precise substances that would mirror them.Then, we took minuscule audio samples from our podcasting apothecary \u2014 skepticism, melancholy, and empathy. We mixed these, diluted them a thousand times, to the point at which they became completely inaudible. Then we shook them up and down while chanting the spell of this bespoke remedy: Conspiritualitis investigarium.Please don\u2019t try to turn up your volume on this episode. You can\u2019t actually hear it, and that\u2019s what makes it so powerful. But seriously folks. Welcome to our long-awaited homeopathy show \u2014 and not a week too soon. NFL\u2019s leading quarterback Aaron Rodgers has just admitted to endangering the entire league by opting to be \u201Cimmunized\u201D via homeopathy rather than complying with the league\u2019s vaccination requirements. (He\u2019s also a lying liar.) There are reports of homeopaths selling COVID19 remedies \u2014 through both small ops in the U.S., and federally-approved dispensers in India, where Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu Nationalists mingled sugar pills with astrology to help disguise their negligent pandemic response. Derek takes us on a tour through the strange history of this medicine that isn\u2019t there, and interviews Jonathan Jarry of the McGill Office for Science and Society on why it haunts us. Julian contextualizes homeopathy against the broader \u201CComplementary and Alternative Medicine\u201D landscape. And Matthew wonders about the uses of magic.

      "description": "There is no avoiding the fact that conspirituality plays out against a backdrop of racially-charged politics and the echoes of colonialism. And from the beginning of this podcast project we\u2019ve tackled things like the origins of yoga and wellness being tangled up with European fascist movements and racist eugenics. We\u2019re speaking from and into a culture that is predominantly white, and has the disposable income to afford boutique health ideologies. We know it\u2019s naturally allergic to the project of public health. We know that it ignores the social determinants of health \u2014 because if it didn\u2019t, it couldn\u2019t sell its green-smoothie-based hero\u2019s journeys.But reporting on race and conspirituality is only going to get harder. In this episode, Matthew reviews a new volume of essays that might help. A Field Guide to White Supremacy, edited by Drs. Kathleen Belew and Ramon Gutierrez, brings together a pile of resources for journalists and policy-makers who want to engage thoughtfully with issues of equality. And he interviews Dr. Belew on best practices, The Great Replacement conspiracy theory, and why there are no \u201Clone wolves.\u201DIn a debrief discussion, Derek and Julian join in to puzzle out the complexities of reporting on Robert F. Kennedy Jr. platforming Black anti-vax activists, how the sources of vax-hesitancy shown by Aaron Rogers and Kyrie Irving might be coming from different places, and how to think empathetically about vaccine hesitancy in Black liberation movements.

But, as Matthew explores in this bonus episode: what are the contours of social comfort and habitus \u2014 supported by faith and ritual \u2014 that haunt any layperson\u0027s relationship to science? When the pressure is on, be it acute or existential, do we really display \u0022critical thinking\u0022 \u2014 or are we really skilled at post-hoc rationalizing choices that embody the social status we wish to identify with?What are the psychosocial scents that waft from institutional actors vs. influencers, and what does it say about history and personal experience that one or the other is inviting, or terrifying?Finally: both Steve Hassan and Lee McIntyre have proposed that careful 1:1 conversations can re-establish interpersonal trust with the indoctrinated. But when we\u0027re talking about making vulnerable populations less susceptible to pseudoscience and conspiracy theories, is this really sufficient? Or must we consider broader forms of social atonement, like reparations?

This story catapults you into Lee Mcintyre\u2019s new book, How to Talk to a Science Denier. As anti-vaccine and anti-quarantine protests flare up around the world, and the pandemic drags us all through financial and emotional destruction, discussing science communication has become more necessary than ever. Mcintyre\u0027s 2018 book, Post-Truth, examined the manipulative world of \u201Calternative facts.\u201D As a sort of addendum, his latest charts a boots-on-the-ground course to understanding and engaging with false beliefs. Julian\u0027s interview with Lee is the main focus of today\u0027s episode.

Toxic mimicries of therapy, mentorship, political awareness, and community.In this investigative report, Matthew digs into the background of a recent article posted to Medium called \u201COpen Letter to Elena Brower.\u201D He interviews the author, Tatum Fjerstad, who Brower mentored from 2014 to 2016, and Liz Fullen, who worked as Brower\u2019s unpaid yoga class assistant for approximately three years. He\u2019ll also play excerpts from a legally-recorded Zoom call in which Brower gives non-consensual \u201Ccoaching\u201D to a stranger. Friend of the pod Dr. Natalia Petrzela joins the story to recount her personal brush with the Handel Coaching Method. Brower is a Handel \u201Cexpert coach\u201D, and has merged the Method with her yoga training to produce peak cognitive-dissonant messaging: You\u2019re fabulous, but you\u0027re fucked. You\u2019re already perfect and you know what\u2019s right for you, but you have a lot of work to do, and I can show you how to do it.Other themes include \u201Cperformative therapy abuse\u201D, the perils of unlicensed therapy, and how the power pyramids that hide in plain sight may be more vulnerable than we know, especially when we begin to talk about them clearly.Show NotesOpen Letter to Elena Brower.

      "description": "With a new variant of QAnon circulating through white evangelical churches, protests against masks and vaccines are becoming more aggressive around the world. In Germany, a gas station attendant who asked a customer to mask-up was shot dead this week, and a Maryland man allegedly killed his pharmacist brother and sister in law, believing that they were poisoning people with vaccines. Demonstrations have turned violent in Australia; in New York, a mobile-free Covid-test site was up-ended. In LA, Beverly Hills protest organizer Shiva Bagheri was caught on video punching a breast cancer patient outside a clinic and harassing parents and kids as they walked into an elementary school, yelling that vaccines are a form of child-rape. For this week\u2019s Bonus, Julian looks at these developments through the lens of research on radicalization and fascist political movements. While Westboro Baptist Church tip-toes right up to the edge of violence with their hateful fundamentalist activism, the anti-abortion movement has included terrorism in the form of bombing, kidnapping, and murder. But it\u2019s not all bad news. This episode ends with data from a recent study on what supports de-radicalization, as well as a hopeful personal account of how compassionate online interactions led one woman to exit a hate group she was born into, and advocate now for tolerance.

Eat according to your chronotype. Cacao resonates with the frequency of the sun, but never, ever add sugar to it. Sugar is toxic. Juice cleanses lead you to your highest self. If you\u2019re exhausted already, so are we. This week, Derek anchors our look at how the wellness world disguises eating disorders as purity tests and pathways to \u201Cclean\u201D eating. He opens up about his 15-year-battle with orthorexia, an eating disorder he believes to be rampant in yoga and wellness, as well as the broader fitness world, where men hide their own eating disorders with protein shakes and ketogenic fasting. Matthew adds kitchen notes from the spiritual cult front lines. Julian talks with Chelsea Roff, founder of Eat Breathe Thrive, about her own struggles with food before discussing her decade of experience working with eating disorder victims in Yogaland. Derek then chats with Dr. Jason Nagata about the challenges of treating boys and men in clinical settings, and what to do about a phenomenon so many suffer from yet so few are able to find a language for.Show NotesThis Is What It\u2019s Like For Men With Eating DisordersEating Disorders in Teens Have \u2018Exploded\u2019 in the PandemicEating Disorders Surged Among Adolescents in PandemicMen obsessed with building muscle mass have higher mental health risksUncovering and Destigmatizing Male Body Dysmorphia in Popular CultureDoctors alerted to dangerous dry scooping workout trendProspective health associations of drive for muscularity in young adult malesWhat Is Orthorexia?Body dysmorphic disorderFilm Theory 101 \u2013 Laura Mulvey: The Male Gaze Theory -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "Whatever one\u2019s conception of \u201CGod\u201D is, \u201CJohn of God\u201D should now be a nauseating name. For decades, Jo\u00E3o Teixeira de Faria pretended to heal an endless stream of pilgrims to his center in rural central Brazil through the Spiritist practice of \u201Cpsychic surgery.\u201D In reality, the miracle healing claims worked to cover up an obvious truth. Jo\u00E3o was sexually assaulting and raping women, in public and in private, likely every day of his \u201Cworking\u201D life. As he did so, he amassed a vast fortune in affiliate businesses, farming operations, real estate, referral rackets, and sales of crystals and fake remedies.In this episode we won\u2019t retell this history, now poignantly captured by a new Brazilian-made documentary on Netflix. Instead, we\u2019ll look at how lazy and motivated journalism shook hands with the entrepreneurial New Age to validate and accelerate the absurd claims of a monster. In addition to original reporting on how Jo\u00E3o made his mark in the U.S., Matthew is joined by former New Age publicist Lisa Braun Dubbels and Brazilian journalist Mirna Wabi Sabi to discuss the globalization of magic and abuse.

The book is his homage to the resources that help him meditate on weaning ourselves from the dissociations of Twitter and doing the hard work of transforming climate grief into climate integrity.In our feature interview this week, Matthew sits down with Daniel to discuss the real conspiracy of climate denialism, and how conspiracy theories provide relief to those who cannot contemplate our condition.We start the show with Derek\u2019s contemplation of Amitav Ghosh\u2019s \u201CThe Great Derangement\u201D and Julian\u2019s notes on climate denialism dwarfing the disinformation we typically interrogate in the wellness world.Show NotesWarmth by Daniel SherrellSherrell and Dorothy Fortenberry on Know Your EnemyWhy Grief can be Strength in a Warming World | Daniel Sherrell |Learning How to Die in the Anthropocene \u2013 ScrantonLaudato si\u2019 (24 May 2015) | FrancisTucker Carlson on Military Vaccine MandateDr. Wilson (Debunk the Funk) on Mike YeadonBig Oil\u2019s War on ScienceUCSA Climate Skeptic Disinformation ListThe Climate Disinformation PlaybookDesmog DatabaseSteven Koonin, the \u201CObama Scientist\u201DDaniel Sherrell\u2019s Reading ListDucks, Newburyport \u2014 EllmanThe Summer Book \u2013 Jannson -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "This week, California Governor Gavin Newsom rode sane pandemic messaging to victory against the Republican-led recall election by a huge margin. Unsurprisingly, voting patterns perfectly matched the state COVID heat map, with fans of the recall suffering the worst outbreaks. Meanwhile, a strict lockdown in Australia, which is experiencing a Delta outbreak, led to American libertarians and right-wing commentators screaming fascism! We talk to Decoding the Gurus co-host (and real-life Australian) Matthew Browne about the situation on the ground. Later in the episode, Julian interviews another Aussie, Dr. Izzy Smith, about her online anti-conspiracy theory activism and science advocacy.In the Ticker, Derek looks at JP Sears\u2019s new cryptocurrency grift, which appears to be inspired by fellow Austinite Mikki Willis\u2014who also announced a supplement grift this week.

      "description": "Paul Chek will tell you how much he\u2019s influenced the fitness industry. He\u2019ll tell you that he popularized Swiss Balls, and about his time working with the Jordan-era Chicago Bulls and then the championship Lakers. The kinesiologist and founder of the Chek Institute, which offers numerous training programs under the slogan, \u201CWe teach the science of living well,\u201D claims that he\u2019s always taken a holistic approach to weightlifting and the gym. In fact, the man does not mind telling you how vast his influence is.Embedded in Chek\u2019s holistic approach is a penchant for conspiratorial thinking. He trained JP Sears, traded podcasts with biohacker Ben Greenfield, hung with anus sunshiner Troy Casey, and hosted Mikki Willis twice in the last year on his own podcast, Living 4D with Paul Chek. Today\u2019s co-host, NYC-based fitness expert Antonio Valladares, also trained with Chek, but unlike many of Chek\u2019s acolytes, Antonio has used his time and knowledge debunking conspiracy theories in nutrition and fitness, not adding to the fire. In this week\u2019s closer, Matthew reviews and contextualizes a Facebook post from the charismatic dissectionist Gil Hedley. Hedley\u2019s post leaned into familiar anti-vax territory. But he deleted it \u2014 and, in a positive email exchange, revealed some earnest motivations and empathetic impulses. A good lesson that you never quite know where people are coming from, or where they\u2019re going.Show NotesDeconstructing Paul ChekWho is Paul Chek: Holistic Lifestyle CoachPlandemic Director Mikki Willis Explains His Presence at Capitol Riot \u2014 Matthew RemskiAbout Gil HedleyGil Hedley: Fascia and stretching:\u00A0 The Fuzz Speech -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

What leaves is the vacuous clinging to achievements that are supposedly preventing us from seeing our true nature. What\u2019s granted is a new mindset, a novel way of being, one in which you are at peace with both yourself and the world.Where does the drive for status play into this quest? As journalist Will Storr points out in his new book, The Status Game: On Social Position and How We Use It, you can\u2019t escape our impulse for achieving status.

      "description": "With guests: Philip Deslippe, Jules Hartley, Janja Lalich, and Stacie StukinWe\u2019ve convened an expert panel this week to remember and discuss Katie Griggs, aka GJ. She died in an LA hospital on the evening of August 1st. LA Magazine was the first outlet to confirm the death with the RA MA Institute, which Griggs co-founded in Venice, CA.The cause of death has not been confirmed, but according to a eulogy film put out by the RA MA Institute, Griggs reportedly broke her ankle in Berlin on July 11th, and on the 15th had surgery to repair it in Los Angeles. Subsequently, she developed a pulmonary embolism, which proved fatal.In episodes 36 and 37, Philip and Stacie joined me to discuss Griggs\u2019s adopted culture and religion, Kundalini Yoga, and where she stood in relation to the legacy of KY\u2019s abusive founder, Yogi Bhajan. They are uniquely equipped for that background: Philip is an expert in KY history, and Stacie has published excellent investigative work on the #metoo wave that swept through the community to uncover long-suppressed stories of Bhajan\u2019s abuses.Joining us today to dig even deeper are former Kundalini Yoga student Jules Hartley, and renowned cult expert Janja Lalich. In our earlier episodes, we discussed how Griggs went on the offensive in the midst of the Kundalini abuse scandal, publicly attacking Bhajan\u2019s survivors. We also discussed how she quickly pivoted into conspiracy theories about COVID and BLM when the pandemic hit. We also discussed the culture and cultural impact of Griggs\u2019s RA MA Institute.We continue that discussion in somber tones today.Show NotesPhilip Deslippe\u2019s websiteJules Hartley on IMDBJanja Lalich\u2019s website and 2021 Recommended Reading ListStacie Stukin on TwitterLA Magazine Griggs death noticeInside the Dubious World of RA MA Yoga, and Its Girl Boss Guru to the Stars \u2014 Cassidy George, VICEGuru Jagat Dies.

      "description": "The YogaVaxGate Instagram post turns out to have been a bellwether for the $88B industry packed with science skeptics and spiritual bypassers. When Wolf Terry got trolled for daring to argue in Yoga Journal that getting vaccinated was an act of non-harming, the stormfront was clear. As thousands of yoga studios ponder opening amidst the stop-and-start waves of Delta and beyond, one question dominates staff meetings: \u201CWill we ask our returning clients for proof of vaccination?\u201D  Matthew interviews Sarah Garden and Colin Hall of Bodhi Tree Yoga in Saskatchewan, who made national news when they announced that yes, they would. Bodhi Tree clients will have to show their card; if they can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to be vaccinated, online classes are still available. Simple, right? Not in Yogaland. We\u2019ll be reading from emails describing the backlash \u2014 from the absurd to the abhorrent \u2014 faced by studio owners who are taking the no-brainer Bodhi Tree path.  In the Ticker, Derek looks at Antisemitism in vaccine disinformation campaigns while Julian checks in with Joseph Mercola, who announced he\u2019ll be removing all content from his website this week. In the Jab, Julian lays out the \u201Cbase-rate fallacy\u201D anti-vaxxers are using to falsely claim that vaccinations are not helping to stop COVID-19.

She was hired from her secular training, but gradually found herself drawn into what she calls an \u201Cinherently racist cult.\u201D Her mentors pushed her towards accepting the 19th-century babblings of Rudolf Steiner, who, among other exploits, read the \u201CAkashic Records\u201D to learn why the spirit world disapproved of vaccines.

All poses shall be limited exclusively to sitting, standing, reclining, twisting, and balancing. All poses, exercises, and stretching techniques shall have exclusively English descriptive names. Chanting, mantras, mudras, use of mandalas, induction of hypnotic states, guided imagery, and namaste greetings shall be expressly prohibited.\u201DThose who promote yoga as a universal good will welcome this Indian art form being made more accessible for children in a State with terrible educational markers. Hindu nationalists, on the other hand, may be outraged at a secularized version of yoga, stripped not only of references to Hinduism, but of signs of any type of Indian spirituality. And a lot of white yoga progressives will look at this policy\u2014mostly from the urban North\u2014 and worry about authenticity and appropriation.How will the children feel?In considering who wins and loses with this new development, Matthew reviews recent U.S. yoga-war history: battles between the Hindu American Foundation and Yoga Journal, the rise of Christian non-yoga-yoga \u201CPraise Moves\u201D, and Encinitas Union School District got sued for allegedly violating the Establishment Clause by contracting devotees of Pattabhi Jois to teach the kids yoga.It\u2019s not a stretch to see an overlap between this theme and the medical-moral panic over vaccines.

In today\u2019s overheated discourse, social media posturing can make the culture wars feel like pro wrestling and political conversation like tip-toeing through a hair-trigger minefield. While these two co-hosts share a healthy skepticism for conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, and New Age grift, some of their underlying philosophical and political beliefs hold interesting tensions. On the table this time: postmodernism, science, cultural sensitivity, Enlightenment values, social constructionism, and grand narratives about the arc of moral history. -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

And for fuck sake: when Bill visited Epstein\u2019s Manhattan lair, reports say, he counseled the predator on image rehab while Epstein counseled Bill on his loveless marriage. Are the conspiritualists right, and about what? Matthew will revisit an earlier essay on Gates, and fill in some blind spots.Derek tackles the obscene co-optation of trans activism by anti-vaxxers who now pledge to lie about their status by \u201Cidentifying as vaccinated.\u201D In keeping with our musical theme, Julian reminisces about playing protest rock under an assumed name and the threat of a bomb under the stage during the Apartheid years in South Africa.In our feature interview, world-weary rock star Alex Ebert\u2014frontman for Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros\u2014joins Derek to map out the late 20th-century slide into infinitely co-opted creativity and revolution. They discuss the reasons America could use death rituals, the rise of Trump as the ultimate New Ager, wellness influencers as \u201Cthe clerical class of the right,\u201D and to ask if critical thinking and open-eyed spirituality are the new punk rock\u2014and for how long.Show NotesThe NYT reported in the fall of 2019 that Gates was a frequent guest of Epstein in ManhattanA description from Town and Country of Epstein\u2019s mansionSources at many meetings describe the Gates-Epstein vibeSex Redefined: The Idea of 2 Sexes Is Overly SimplisticThe Gene: An Intimate History | Siddhartha MukherjeeInside the Republican Anti-Transgender MachineGender-affirming surgery linked to better mental health, study finds\u201CIdentify As\u201D Twitter thread -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

Of course, the pandemic is far from over.

Meanwhile, Derek unpacks the repeated fat-shaming being done by conspiritualists when boasting of their awesome immune systems. In this week\u2019s interview, Derek talks with Venezuelan-American singer/songwriter Devendra Banhart about global music, anti-vaxxers, conspiritualist ideology, and paying $24 for a smoothie in Malibu.

His \u201CDisinformation Dozen\u201D white paper made a huge splash, prompting a conference call with Nancy Pelosi\u2019s team ahead of their biannual grilling of Zuckerberg and Dorsey. Ahmed\u2019s paper spotlights the fact that 65% of anti-vax content originates from just 12 social media figures. Conspirituality superstars Sayer Ji, Kelly Brogan, and Christiane Northrup hold positions 8, 9, and 10. Ahmed wants them deplatformed\u2014and he\u2019s making it happen. In response, the Dozen are raising money and having themselves caricatured as superheroes.Who have they been deceiving and emotionally abusing? This week Matthew interviews Heather Simpson and Lydia Greene from Back to the Vax, an anti-disinformation think-tank they founded after fleeing the online cult of anti-vax propaganda. In their first interview together, Simpson and Greene recount how mother-centered anti-vax social media spaces drew them in and exposed them to all manner of anxious conspiracism\u2014and what it cost them to leave. They\u2019ve got a very clear message about how public health communications can meet this entrenched challenge.In the Ticker, Julian tracks the Dozen\u2019s emerging strategy, Derek finally addresses the English elephant in the room, Russell Brand, and Matthew takes an early look at the big reveal of Cullen Hoback\u2019s Q: Into the Storm on HBO.Show NotesWhat \u201CCauses\u201D Covid?

When a research firm spotlights Sayer Ji as a disinformation super-spreader, he calls them a hate group. When Lil Nas X spins a catharsis of gay-goth dreams, he embodies MAGA disgust. It\u2019s an age of misdirection.It\u2019s also an age of transference. Living and breathing people become memes. The impulse to communicate gets devoured by the need to perform. Drives to justice adopt dominant affects.\u00A0 Real conspiracies get overshadowed by myths. We\u2019re keeping ourselves very busy while the world burns,\u0027This week we\u2019re releasing a bonus episode into the wild that speaks to a small wedge of the transference game. Matthew contemplates what it means, in both helpful and unhelpful ways, to be named as or reduced to \u201Ccis white men\u201D, and how important issues can get lost in the dead zone between culture wars and cults.Both conspirituality and social media influence are driven by the hot take, the keyword, the avatar, and the speed of emotional reactivity. And cults are glued together by intense, non-negotiable emotional demands on participants. So far we\u2019ve shown how all of these elements degrade our chances to evaluate evidence and resist being conned by charismatics or cult leaders. Our hope is that we contribute to a slower and open-ended exploration of how to balance the rhetoric of social change with the nuance of interpersonal empathy.In the Ticker, Derek looks at the retraction crisis plaguing scientific research.

In this episode, we\u2019ll review how the first two episodes of Cullen Hoback\u2019s \u201CInto the Storm\u201D lands, and wonder about what happens when conspiracy movements come under big-screen and academic scrutiny.Cullen embedded within the labyrinthine Q-world for almost four years. He globetrotted, gaining incredible access to a network of social avoidants and keyboard warriors. His sympathy is both touching and problematic. Our own embedding in the wellness world \u2014 sixty years between the three of us \u2014 hasn\u2019t been quite so weird or dangerous. But it does raise a similar question: how clearly can we see the conspirituality of the world we\u2019ve worked in for so long? As Cullen tries to draw out the humanity and intentionality of the QAnons, how are we understanding \u2014 or missing \u2014 our own subjects? Then there\u2019s the question of impact. Will America understand itself more clearly after Cullen\u2019s work? And where will the scholarship on conspirituality go after we dump our research on that conference table?In the Ticker this week, we review the new Lululemon mat, report on how Imran Ahmed\u2019s team at the CCDH identified the social media Disinformation Dozen and succeeded in partially deplatforming conspiritualist power-couple Sayer Ji and Kelly Brogan.

      "description": "Back in December, a certified anesthesiologist named Dr. Madhava Setty posted a long critique of our podcast to the New Age website Collective Evolution. While cordial and apparently well-meaning, Setty\u2019s essay failed to quote a single episode. Setty filled in his own blanks with outright misrepresentations, leading with: \u201CMatthew, Derek and Julian\u2026 assume that there are no large conspiracies in play in our world at this time. To state it flatly, to them the idea of a large conspiracy is so preposterous that they cannot even see that they are making an assumption when dismissing the possibility.\u201DThere\u2019s no planet on which any of our episodes have said anything of the kind. In fact, we\u2019ve repeatedly affirmed the opposite: that conspiracy theories and conspiritualists that monetize them exist because real conspiracies traumatize people. Tuskegee happened. MKUltra was real. #savethechildren took hold in part because Jeffery Epstein\u2019s network has not yet been fully understood or prosecuted.Setty is so well-mannered and convincing, however, that New Age influencers who might be feeling a little defensive about how the yoga and wellness world has shown its ass in 2020 have welcomed his dulcet tones with open arms. In one appearance, he guested on J. Brown\u2019s Yoga Talks podcast, and provided a master class on how to lead an anxious and altruistic yoga devotee into conspirituality. We didn\u2019t respond to Setty\u2019s initial essay because there was nothing to respond to: he didn\u2019t offer any data. But now we think it\u2019s worth examining in detail how, in real time \u2014 and before he winds up on Joe Rogan \u2014 he seductively spins together theories about divine consciousness, 9/11, COVID, and how everything is not as it seems.In the Jab, Julian reviews the scare-mongering of the newest seemingly-qualified anti-vax doc, Geert Vanden Bossche.

      "description": "This episode follows up on earlier discussions on the podcast about how we manage privilege. Our exploration of cancel culture \u2014 specifically that part of it that is really a form of horizontal violence \u2014 isn\u2019t motivated by any shift to the right, but by a desire to unpack the rhetoric, jargon, and performative behaviours, that, so often in the reductive rhythm of social media, serve to shut down learning, and polarize progressives that might otherwise work together.Here, Matthew focuses on how a rhetorical device in social justice relates to our project: what it means, in both helpful and unhelpful ways, to be named as or reduced to \u201Ccis white men\u201D.Reduction and essentialism are key aspects of the meme-ification of our politics, and potent weapons in the arsenal of conspirituality. None of the influencers we study on this podcast would have gained their social power without labelling and essentializing their opponents in black-and-white terms, without taking black-and-white positions on things like vaccines, big Pharma, and whether or not a person is \u201Cawake\u201D.Both conspirituality and social media influence are driven by the tag, the hot take, the keyword, the avatar, and the speed of emotional reactivity. And cults are glued together by intense, non-negotiable emotional demands on participants. So far we\u2019ve shown how all of these elements degrade our chances to evaluate evidence and resist being conned by charismatics or cult leaders.

      "description": "Imagine that you\u2019re 25 years old. You grew up Irish, gay, and online. When the Orlando Pulse massacre explodes, you go to YouTube for the news. You watch Milo Yiannopolous and Gavin McInnes fake-kiss in front of the police-taped club and say that the Muslims are coming to kill all gay people. YouTube\u2019s algorithm spins you downward into anti-Islamic content. Before long, you\u2019ve left your marketing job with a mission: to make slick propaganda videos for some of the most despicable alt-right ghouls on the planet. You believe they\u2019ll stand up for you.How did you get here at such a young age? What does it feel like? If you have a change of heart, if you want to fight back against your old life and its consequences, who will believe you? Should they believe you? How will you help them believe you?Today Matthew asks Caolan Robertson these difficult questions. After years of being the PR man for people like Tommy Robinson and Laura Southern, Robertson has shaken it off and started to collaborate with other ex-alt-right members on a deradicalization project called Future Freedom.In the Ticker, Julian reports on the new QAnon variant infecting telegram, Sabmyk.

Shame will make things worse. He told this story about how his elderly neighbor brought him homemade cookies when he finally returned home after years in the cult of Rev. Moon.

His strategy\u2014and he has the data to prove it works\u2014is to block, isolate, and clear the public space for content that is actually helpful. Where Hassan offers an open hand, Ahmed says, \u201CTalk to the hand.\u201DWe\u2019re nine months on from those interviews. Are we living up to either of them?

      "description": "Around 2015, the alt-right movement erupted online to both provoke and monetize MAGA momentum and distort and defame the real-world progress symbolized in Barack Obama and agitated by Black Lives Matter. Young white supremacist poster-boy Richard Spencer and edgy internet crypto-racists like Lauren Southern, Mark Cernovich, and Gavin McInnes led the viral charge, racking up subscribers while lining their pockets on the side. Daniel Lombroso of The Atlantic embedded with their ilk from 2016-18, collecting enough footage to release the award-winning documentary, White Noise. Julian sat down to talk with him about the movement, and about making this film while Jewish.Was any of this a surprise to anti-oppression activists on the ground? Not according to Michelle Cassandra Johnson, author of Skill in Action: Radicalizing Your Yoga Practice to Create a Just World. While the white supremacy Lombroso whistleblows is spectacular and absurd, the white supremacy Johnson and other justice activists feel in their bones has been a centuries-long war of attrition against equality. Matthew sits down with Johnson to discuss how the yoga and wellness worlds in particular are (and are not) responding to the intensification of both calls to justice, as well as the blowback.In the Ticker, we wonder if Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s new long-COVID Goop merch\u2014and her \u201Clonger-term detox\u201D that includes selling Goop-approved $500 blankets and $8,000 necklaces\u2014heralds a dawning era in high-end disability consumerism.Show NotesIt took a year, but Gwyneth Paltrow figured out how to exploit the pandemicGwyneth Paltrow Is Selling VibratorsHealing My Body with a Longer-Term DetoxThe NHS dings Gwyneth\u2019s long COVID curesLauren Southern hides the face of her biracial babyDaniel Lombroso\u2019s White NoiseSouthern Poverty Law on CernovichSouthern Poverty Law on SouthernRichard Spencer, white subsidy suckerMichelle Cassandra Johnson\u2019s websiteMichelle Cassandra Johnson\u2019s  -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

We wanted something untouched by our cities and factories and labs; something that reminded us of a world we never really knew. \u201CNature\u201D was in such short supply that we had to invent it to colonize it anew, in exotic lands and mystical beasts: the deer whose antler gave longevity, the cow whose milk strengthened our family bonds.

Matthew looks at Guru Jagat\u2019s (Katie Griggs\u2019s) pseudo-Tibetan mystical poem dedicated to her ex-con mentor, Harijiwan (Stephen Hartzell), whose current wife, Mandev, is about 30 years his junior and makes RA MA propaganda films. Will RA MA survive lockdown with COVID-busting mantras? Will Yogi Bhajan\u2019s crimes be washed away by the ringing of the RA MA gong?We know by now that cults never let a good crisis go to waste. We\u2019ll also examine how, when there are no global panics for cults to monetize, it\u2019s up to the leader to create one.

      "description": "Episodes 36 \u0026 37 cover how Guru Jagat (Katie Griggs) and her Venice Beach RAMA Institute have pivoted in the COVID era to a new area of focus: anti-lockdown, anti-\u201Cwoke\u201D rhetoric, anti-masking, and anti-vax propaganda. As the center of her own weather system in the wider Kundalini Yoga / 3HO cult, this serves Griggs in a number of ways, from driving engagement to obscuring 2020\u2019s revelations of just how criminal her umbrella organization is.Cults will never let a good crisis go to waste. Back in the summer, Matthew noticed that Michael Roach, who led the cult he was recruited into from 1996-99, also pivoted to COVID content. He does it with a lot more credibility than Griggs does, but in some ways, this makes it even more obnoxious. In this bonus episode, Matthew analyzes his late-summer \u201CLove in the Time of the Virus\u201D content as a retread of what he\u2019s put out there for more than 20 years now.Sinking into Michael\u2019s vibe again after all these years brings up old questions for Matthew around earnestness and delusion, altruism and manipulation. It makes him wonder whether a cult\u2019s dogged fixation on doctrine can sometimes be an artifact of the leader\u2019s arrested development.Show NotesNina Burleigh\u2019s profile in Rolling StoneScott Carney\u2019s investigation of the death of Ian Thorson (originally in Playboy)My own somewhat cranky review of Carney\u2019s work -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "What happens when a charismatic yogalebrity rises to prominence in LA\u2019s fashion and wellness scene, gets exposed as an inheritor of a notorious cult, and then gets sideswiped by a pandemic? Meet Katie Griggs, aka \u201CGuru Jagat,\u201D who, instead of reassessing her channelled \u201Cdownloads\u201D from the charlatan rapist Yogi Bhajan and lending a hand to public health, has chosen to boost her online game with COVID contrarianism and by platforming David Icke.Our guests this week are Philip Deslippe and journalist Stacie Stukin. Philip\u2019s penetrating and bulletproof research into the dodgy history of Kundalini Yoga and its criminal founder Yogi Bhajan shook the modern yoga world in 2012. Stacie\u2019s 2020 LA Magazine feature investigation into Kundalini corruption and abuse gathered decades of buried evidence. Together they paint a lucid, non-sensationalized picture of how a high-demand religious group navigates new opportunities for manipulation.The larger picture is that COVID has been a challenge for the brick-and-mortar assets of cults, which, like every other business, rely on pedestrian traffic and the \u201Cretail space\u201D of ritual conversion. But in other ways, COVID is the best thing that could have happened to cults. Kundalini Yoga was built on promising perfect health, the conversion of fear into love, and a golden age free from atheistic biotech. For people like Griggs\u2014and her ex-con mentor Harijiwan\u2014COVID is an opportunity to hide dirty laundry and market the same empty promises with heightened panic and passion.Show Notes\u201CFrom Maharaj to Mahan Tantric: The Construction of Yogi Bhajan\u2019s Kundalini Yoga\u201D for Sikh Formations by Philip Deslippe (2012)\u201CYogi Bhajan Turned an L.A.

It\u2019s the perfect time to talk about where mystical or deceptive knowledge comes from, how it works, and what happens when it fails. We may never know who Q was, but we can take a close look at a core feature of conspirituality technique: the transmission of secret knowledge. Welcome to our channeling episode.Today we discuss three Q-adjacent channellers: JZ Knight, Lorie Ladd, Elizabeth April, and also Paul Selig. What do they say they\u2019re doing? What does it sound like? And where can we go to figure it out? Derek looks at consciousness studies through the lens of Rodolfo Llinas, Stanislas Dehaene, Michael Gazzaniga, and other renowned researchers. Julian reviews the philosophical arguments of Daniel Dennett and Susan Blackmore. Matthew plays angel\u2019s advocate and interviews Professor Susannah Crockford about her anthropological fieldwork amongst the New Agers and channelers of Sedona. TL;DR: \u201CThere\u2019s never a single answer for anything.\u201DIn the Ticker we look at a tragic anti-vax related father-son murder-suicide in California, anti-vax groups grifting PPP money from the feds, and the Anons, exiled even from Parler, suffering from the collapse of their dream of a Great Awakening.

      "description": "It\u2019s been eight days since the Capitol was ransacked by a mob of MAGA supporters, Proud Boys, ex-military with tactical gear, and Nazis wearing disgustingly anti-Semitic t-shirts. The death count is six (for now), with a second police officer dying by duty-related suicide on Saturday. As more footage streams in\u2014and the FBI says there\u2019s still more to come\u2014it will get uglier.So what have our conspiritualists been up to? We\u2019ll run it down this week. Quick story: not a single one has walked back any of their bullshit in the aftermath of the Capitol siege. Some have doubled down.An unmasked Mikki Willis was involved in the siege as a \u201Cjournalist,\u201D giving an impassioned anti-vax, pro-liberty speech at a sideshow MAGA event in which he called the ransack that he had just taken part in \u201Cbeautiful.\u201D Christiane Northrup cheered on the alt-health berserkers during the end of her water fast. Zach Bush took to Instagram to sermonize, saying, \u201CJust as viruses do not take down healthy humans, revolutions do not take down healthy governance.\u201D Lori Ladd spoke in radiant non-sequiturs.Amber Sears announced she was \u201Cpreparing for civil war\u201D while her husband JP whined about free speech as his Parler account got nuked and Trump got booted off of Twitter. Meanwhile, Kelly Brogan said nothing publicly about the Capitol siege that we could find, but cashed in on the vibes with a bloated essay on \u201Cspiritual warfare.\u201DWe also learned a lot about Jacob Anthony Chansley nee Angeli, the Q-shaman, and his interdimensional conspirituality performance art\u2014as well as his three-day jail fast that was resolved after a sympathetic judge guaranteed a Whole Foods delivery.Derek interviews RP Eddy, CEO of strategy and geopolitical intelligence firm, Ergo.

It\u2019s all very grand, and it doesn\u2019t come from nowhere. Trendy spiritualities of the privileged and disconnected have always focused on the heroic triumph of the individual, which has made them easily co-optable by the right.But what is a real hero? Joseph Campbell contextualized their journey as a ritual of selfless wandering, undertaken on behalf of the community. The concept of the monomyth, which Campbell defined as the Hero\u2019s Journey, has stages, and they have influenced popular culture in profound and, at times, troubling ways.In this episode, we\u2019ll look at how certain influencers confuse heroism for megalomania and forget that heroes and their societies are interdependent. Derek and Julian measure some of the usual suspects against Campbell\u2019s ruler while Matthew asks questions about what makes a theory vulnerable to distortion. In The Jab, Julian looks at the three top questions vaccine-hesitant folks have about the mRNA vaccines currently approved for COVID. In a closing essay, Matthew reflects on a space where the painful splits of conspirituality might be calmed: how the home hospice can bring together public health and private spirituality.Show NotesJake Angeli, \u201CQ-Shaman\u201D, describing his New-Age servicesCNN on Angeli, \u201CBaked Alaska\u201D and BarnettThe Q shaman \u2014 conspirituality runs riot on Capitol HillBarnett and \u201CSave Our Children\u201D event in AR in OctoberJP Sears echoes a justification for ransacking Pelosi\u2019s officeAnti-maskers Storm California Mall, Harass Shoppers and Refuse to LeaveWhy Lisa Guerrero Abruptly Ended Interview With Anti-Mask WearerTommy John Sr. hospitalized for COVIDDr. Tommy John denies his father hospitalized with COVID has COVID(Tommy\u2019s follow-up post shows his son (?) playing a video game in a COVID-denyi -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

Are we getting our bearings yet? Will we see land soon?This episode is centered on Part 2 of Matthew\u2019s discussion with Charles Eisenstein \u2014 a bellwether for the possibility that wellness and spirituality culture can communicate clearly about conspirituality. In the discussion and analysis that follows the interview, we look at who gets to say what and from which platform, what it means to be brave versus what it means to be evidence-based, and whether South Park really did predict the Trump-Biden choice.In the Ticker, we\u2019ll peek into the bizarro world of Guru Jagat, run down what anti-vaxxers believe about ingredients, ogle at Michael Flynn\u2019s QAnon merch shop, and dive into Lori Ladd\u2019s recent video where she rallies the troops after a revelatory nap.

      "description": "This episode dropped for our Patreon supporters on the darkest day of the year. We\u2019re unlocking it as a holiday gift to all of our listeners.In this meditation, Matthew reflects on the roots and implications of \u201Cblazes of light\u201D that punctuate the speech of both spiritualists and conspiritualists, from the spaces of patriarchal religious ritual to the claustrophobia of the manosphere. One key question: How does the manosphere shape conspirituality and its emotional disorders?This is a tour through the trance states that charismatic men love and manipulate\u2014how they carry streams of emotion that can never be transparently shared. Matthew investigates the means by which the podcast format squeezes entranced speech into a man-cave so that the speaker can be endlessly extroverted, but also self-protected, and mostly unaccountable.It is an ethereal and frictionless technology, imposing no limits on the impulse to hold court or to dominate. It allows Alex Jones, Jordan Peterson, Dr. Tommy John, JP Sears, and many others to create limitless self-centered content with almost no feedback. The lack of reality-checking makes their discourse aggressive, but it\u2019s also tragic to watch men believe they are forming relationships while they talk into the void.No solstice bonus wouldn\u2019t be complete without a nod to the light, however.

It\u2019s a respectful but robust conversation about the limits of what laypeople can know about science and journalism, the intersection between conspiracy theory and myth, what the word \u201Cnarrative\u201D really means, and whether activism on the left and conspiracy theories on the right can be equally misguided.

Here\u2019s a taste.Bro Science is junk science spewed by men who believe their charisma is a substitute for training. It brags, mocks, overreaches. It\u2019s self-serving and self-interested. It can carry hints of toxic masculinity: entitlement, unearned confidence, no qualms about taking up space, repressing emotion or hiding it behind humour or grandiosity. It preaches individualism and self-sufficiency from the lonely triumph of Bro.We\u2019ll listen to some top \u201CBro scientists\u201D to see how bro-ness reduces, minimizes, and mocks science. We\u2019ll listen to pearls of bro-dom from JP Sears, Kyle Kingsbury, Aubrey Marcus, Sayer Ji, Toronto\u2019s very own BBQAnon, Adam Skelly, and Zach Bush, doctor to the bros.

We\u2019ll also continue with \u201CThe Jab\u201D, our segment on conspirituality-driven vaccine hesitancy.The big news this week is the resurrection of Jordan Peterson. After surviving a medically-induced coma in a Russian rehab facility, and then COVID on top of that, Peterson has re-emerged, weakened but resolute, as both hero and provocateur. The announcement from Penguin Canada that his new book of another dozen self-help rules prompted Penguin employees to protest their involvement in an emotional town hall.In this episode, we\u2019ll dive into Peterson\u2019s imaginarium. We won\u2019t totally discount his button-down commonsensical advice, but we will explore how it has lent intellectual support to the alt-right. Is he a conspiritualist pioneer as he wars against the Neo-Marxist Cabal and dreams of a Jungian promised land? Matthew will add a view from Peterson\u2019s hometown of Toronto, where the messianic prof has been open about his ambitions in right-wing Ontario politics.

      "description": "Do famous people become famous for staying in their lane? Do some find fame by carving out a lane that never existed before? What is the disruptive promise of charisma in this wellness space, which draws consumers burdened by a double disillusionment? They arrive, disillusioned by conventional medicine and conventional religion. What can the charismatic influencer offer them, and how do they do it?In this last free bonus episode, Matthew explores the charismatic logic of wellness, in which yoga teachers can become famous by playing at being doctors,\u00A0 and doctors can become famous by playing at being priests. Starting with the strange tale of BKS Iyengar (and how he stretched his way into all three roles through sheer will), this journey will lay out how the basic schtick of the 20th-century the wellness personality has primed the ground for our current explosion in conspirituality.Matthew will look at how MDs like Tom Cowan, Kelly Brogan, Christiane Northrup, and Zach Bush all run the \u201CIyengar Arc\u201D in reverse. Where the yoga master was unschooled in medicine, these doctors are unschooled in spirituality. But that doesn\u2019t stop them from pretending to be experts in a weird cocktail that fails both. In their aspirations to spiritual leadership, they each screw the pooch. Cowan ends up shilling for Rudolf Steiner, who knew nothing about viruses, and even less about how not to be a racist. Brogan thinks that Kundalini Yoga is \u201Cthousands of years old\u201D even though it was invented by a sociopath in the 1970s. Northrup seems to think that angel channelers are qualified to tell people how to live. And Zach Bush recounts a mystical experience to a group of retreatants in Italy, in which he became a sardine, and realized he wasn\u2019t afraid to die\u2014partly why he uses Reiki instead of pain medication when he\u2019s on the hospice shift.Ultimately, the \u201Ccharismatic collapse\u201D between doctor and priest distorts medicine and makes spirituality banal. Perhaps if we see this clearly, we\u2019ll look for better leaders.Show NotesIyengar\u2019s Light on Yoga wikiFoucault\u2019s Les Mots et Les Choses wikiBrogan\u2019s Vital Life ProjectAnne Cushman interviews BKS Iyengar for Yoga Journal, 1997 About Siddha Yoga Tom Cowan\u2019s disciplinary rap sheetCowan\u2019s disinfo vidCBC debunks CowanDr. Wilson  -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "Trump\u2019s personal pastor Paula White seizes the podium to speak in tongues and prophesize that angels from Africa will certify her master\u2019s electoral victory. Evangelical Kenneth Copeland laughs maniacally at the devilish proposition that Biden has won. They both yearn to squeeze some drop of ecstasy from the husk of conservative politics. How much of the emotional terrorism rolling through these times is the return of the repressed?  In our weekly reporting, Derek looks at Australian chef Pete Evans and his nostalgia for fascist mysticism, hidden beneath green shakes and doTerra downlines. Julian covers Dr. Northrup\u2019s latest viral science fictions, as well as the bizarre Nazi comparisons trending on conspiritualist pages. Matthew looks at nested repressions returning with a vengeance: QAnon resurrecting the Satanic Panic, Bill Gates as the return of the vampire, and the strange new phenomenon of the Aggro-Spiritual Boss Babe Rage Witch, whose coin seems to be on the rise just as the Mark Walsh Spiritual Pick-Up Artist currency tanks. He also considers distinctions between canceling and punching sideways, picking up from last week\u2019s episode.  Then, in a rich interview with author of The Immortality Key, Brian Muraresku, Derek explores the ancient psychedelia of Christianity, both forgotten and repressed, and hopes for its return, as it would probably make Paula White and Kenneth Copeland chill TF out.

Willis pitched his new documentary and complained about Marxist professors pied-pipering children towards BLM before a new-age preacher sold allotments in a new alt-health ranch community in Texas. Derek covers this ultimate reveal of the conspirituality grift: predict the apocalypse, then sell off-grid cribs on a five-acre manmade lagoon. Fill the swamp, indeed.  Meanwhile, Julian covers the election of Marjorie Taylor Greene and Madison Cawthorn, QAnon arrests in Philly, and the shitstorm of irate comments against YogaGirl as she stands up for decency.  The election over, our critical work continues. How do we keep it on target? How do we make sure that we don\u2019t become so cynical\u2014or so attached to the process of criticism itself\u2014that we can\u2019t find solidarity? And how do we look for solutions while enthralled by social media, as opposed to being invested in society?  Our guests this week are Clementine Morrigan and Jay from Fucking Cancelled. Matthew will be asking them about the work that the digital Left can do to foster solidarity, loyalty, and freedom. It\u2019s an important conversation because we have to assume that some of the redpilled were already being pushed out the door. Why?

      "description": "Mark Walsh, the proprietor of The Embodiment Conference, was recently challenged by cultural somaticist Tada Hozumi in an Open Letter, penned by Hozumi in lieu of accepting the invitation to speak at the Conference. Hozumi proposed that Walsh look more closely at the exclusionary economy of his ambitious project \u2014 specifically, at how it centers white men as the heroes of the somatic techniques that colonialism handed them. The letter, dignified and sincere, offered a concise and workable framing of a fraught issue. Walsh did not respond directly, but on his personal Facebook shitposted about being oppressed by \u201Cc*ntery\u201D of social justice \u201Ctwats.\u201DThose familiar with this aspect of Walsh\u2019s online persona were not surprised. He has openly risen to market dominance in the online somatasphere as a kind of Black Belt culture warrior, a Jordan Peterson in a jock-strap. In this bonus episode, Matthew reviews some of Walsh\u2019s past online hits as a case study of how the wellness world can confuse acting out for freedom, somatic dominance for discipline, and allow charismatic men to weaponize unhealed wounds in the name of authenticity.Show NotesOpen Letter to Mark Walsh and The Embodiment ConferenceThe Embodiment Conference and \u201Csomafascism\u201D: commentary from Ben SpatzMark Walsh to 2020 TEC invited presenter (the audio is from 2019)Statement: We need to divest from Mark Walsh and The Embodiment ConferenceYes, Mr. Walsh, there are Black people in Hungary.

We could sense that our footholds of community, reasonable conversation, and consensus reality were eroding. As veterans of spirituality and wellness spaces, we\u2019ve always known that the reality has never lived up to the hype. But the intensification of conspirituality themes, incubating during lockdown into the peak fever-state of QAnon, has made this period especially demoralizing. What do we need now, on the eve of uncertainty? What will we need going forward?  This week, we take some time to explore thoughts and feelings about this menacing week, and how we\u2019re contemplating and committing to the long haul through our work, relationships, and self-care.

Louise Hay, for one, was fond of quoting it. Matthew proposes that A Course in Miracles is the unacknowledged in-house bible for Hay House.

      "description": "The reality of a second COVID wave started back in the Spring. Now that With over half of American states are experiencing increased cases, the conspiracy theories are surging. At least 32 White House staff and allies, as well as the president and his wife, have tested positive, likely originating in an unmasked close-quartered super-spreader Rose Garden celebration of Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett.  As Trump poses for wheezing conquering hero propaganda following his questionable return from Walter Reed, another type of second wave is being led by brandwashed conspiritualists. Yoga and wellness loyalists are pushing back against criticism of their use of Q hashtags while reveling in mask opposition, anti-vaxxer agendas, and a distorted slacktivist approach to child trafficking that forms the foundation of QAnon. Pastel Q is surging.  This week, Julian investigates the terrifying Line In The Sand online conference, which featured friends of the pod, Mikki Willis, Zach Bush, Christiane Northrup, and many others. Matthew focuses on the chaos of charismatic leadership, weighing Trumpian tactics with the likes of Chogyam Trungpa and Yogi Bhajan. Derek explores the importance of creativity in the time of quarantine, leading into his interview with musician and former cult member, Ben Lee.  The entire crew also discusses Yoga Journal following the lead of the NY Times and Rolling Stone by reporting (and then bearing the backlash) on yoga community leaders taking a stand against QAnon\u2014and getting trolled by Q devotees in the process.

He\u2019s clearly not any one thing. But what is the one thing conspiritualists fantasize him to be? What archetypal role does he play for those who hate him?In this meditation, Matthew zeroes in on the briefly-mentioned biographical datum that Gates was bullied as a boy to unfold his symbolic power as neuroatypical scapegoat. If we listen carefully, he argues, we\u2019ll hear something very high-school-ish, laced with homophobia and latent violence, in the lazy defamations slung at Gates.\u00A0Is it a surprise that Trump graduated from the New York Military Academy in 1964\u2014the same year that a horrific hazing incident cost several administrators their jobs? Is it a surprise, given what we saw in that so-called debate, that Trump\u2019s school had written hazing into their cadet manual? No, it\u2019s not. And when Biden pauses and smiles, and shakes his head, and his gaze falls, is he remembering what it was like to have had a stutter in an all-boys school?\u00A0We spend a lot of time on this podcast unravelling the shoddy thinking at the heart of our conspirituality and political landscapes. These 24 minutes tackles primal cruelty that is up to men to address\u2014if they can remember it, and challenge that sad assumption that it\u2019s simply the way of the world. -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "Thirty-two days out from the election and every hour reveals another layer of intensity. The more widely conspirituality and QAnon spreads, the more normalized mundane political violence becomes.  In this episode, Derek looks at how the virus of conspiracism is now overtly threatening the basic premises of voting, as Emperor Trump projects a fiction about electoral fraud, even as he loses his clothes. Matthew looks at a crucial part of this normalization: how Q himself, whoever he is, is now brandwashing, advising followers to abandon familiar Q-words. How then are resisters like Seane Corn to address this brainworm as it shape-shifts, co-opting the visuals of wellness and even the jargon of social justice? Julian steps back for a broader look, reviewing the pod\u2019s discoveries and themes so far, and visualizing where they might lead.  We interview Mike Rains, one of the brave moderators of the 25K member subreddit QAnonCasualties, who has a lot to say about what the Q-hole feels like when it rips up hearts and homes.

They also explore the amazing world of \u201Cspiritual warfare handbooks,\u201D which have a history in US evangelicalism, are bestsellers in Q-land, and in some ways resemble new-age self-help manuals. They discuss prophecy, speaking in tongues, and the impacts of demonology on marginalized identities.\u00A0Professor O\u2019Donnell specializes in American Religious and Cultural Studies, with a focus on the religious right and systems of dehumanization. They study Islamophobia, antisemitism, transphobia, and religious nationalism.

Julian delves into the muddy culture of yoga and antidepressants\u2014the bad advice, the stigma, the magical thinking.

Derek and Julian interview Matthew about his recent feature investigation on conspirituality power couple, Dr. Kelly Brogan and Sayer Ji. There\u2019s lots of material that didn\u2019t make the final copy, like how Brogan\u2019s conspirituality could endanger the mental health of her online clients, and how her usage of Kundalini Yoga as a supplemental therapy is riddled with false historical and medical claims.

Our second guest, cult researcher and historian Jared Yates Sexton joins us to talk about his new book, American Rule. He discusses the longstanding conspiracies that have influenced America since its very founding as well as the chronic problem of American exceptionalism.

American white supremacists chug gallons of local milk to prove their lactose tolerance and their claim that they alone should occupy the Global North.  Extreme examples aside: it\u2019s clear that key elements of the alt-right and the New Age agree that the Earth is sacred. Bountiful and healing, the Earth preserves everything lost to industrialization, Big Pharma, and globalization. Home is where the soil is. But whose home? Who\u2019s welcome here? Who can afford it? Who\u2019s allowed to own it, and who has to slave-labor on it? For all the supposed concern for ecology, why aren\u2019t we seeing conspiritualists and QAnon devotees marching against carbon emissions, celebrating the carbon drops of lockdown, supporting the migrant workers who pick their arugula, or starting community gardens in their food-desert cities?  This week Matthew reviews the soft-fascist \u201Cblood and soil\u201D themes of conspirituality culture. Derek gives some background and context on the romanticization problem with agriculture. And Julian looks at the quasi-scientific premises and promises that podcast fave Dr. Zach Bush offers in response. We also bring you an interview with farming activist John Roulac, who\u2019s incensed at how conspirituality is ripping up progressive foodie movements. In a recent article, he called out his old friends and associates (like Mikki Willis and Christiane Northrup) for what he calls their \u201Cbody-snatching\u201D beliefs.

From that perspective, a modern industry marketed with Shiva-Shakti figurines is yet another example of capitalist yoga in a privileged society.  Derek opens this week discussing a redpilled-lite video by Danielle LaPorte, while Julian discusses an intensely personal story related to Tantra; he also explores the role of the Aghoris. We break from Tantra talk during Matthew\u2019s interview with Alex Auder, a veteran yoga instructor who uses comedy as a relief mechanism from the QAnon craziness in the yoga world.

Real talk: conspirituality has clearly become both a front and a gateway for the fever-dream of QAnon. As mainstream news outlets wake up to the sordid reality that independent journalists have been tracking for two years, we find neither stream truly conceptualizing answers or methods for recovery and healing. Going forward, we\u2019re going to concentrate not only on critique, but also offering solutions.  Our guest this week is Lorna Liana, publisher of Entheonation.

This week we\u2019re joined by two experts that explain the overt and subtle impacts involved.  Regan Williams, CEO and founder of Seen \u0026 Heard, a nonprofit that provides youth in foster care with professional and personal development via the performing arts, offers a ground zero perspective of trafficked children and teens (and the people that actually care for them) being made even more invisible by conspiratorial clicktivism.  Religious Studies scholar and trauma-sensitive yoga consultant, Dr. Theo Wildcroft, joins us from England to discuss the consequences of trauma histories being hijacked for political and emotional manipulation. She offers insight into the mythic elements of conspirituality-to-Q that cannot be ignored if we want to understand how trauma is both stored and resisted.  On This Week in Conspirituality, Matthew considers the absurdity of David Wolfe accusing the medical community of not doing anything about cancer. Julian investigates anti-Semitic blood libel themes in QAnon and Derek discusses the chronic dangers of seeking utopia.

      "description": "Two of this podcast\u2019s hosts have been involved in destructive cult dynamics. Matthew\u2019s three years with Michael Roach and three years at Endeavor Academy are at the root of his cult research and journalism. Julian\u2019s six years in the inner circle around what he describes as Ana Forrest\u2019s incendiary and manipulative approach to yoga left him with repressed memories. Those experiences also left his family deeply scarred by some of the same Satanic Panic themes prevalent in the QAnon movement. His ongoing work advocating for critical thinking and community health is part of his recovery.  Derek describes himself as being \u201Ccult-adjacent\u201D\u2014not uncommon for a lifelong wellness industry professional. In this episode, he\u2019ll interview Julian and Matthew about their cult experiences, the recovery process, and cultic dynamics in modern yoga, Buddhist, and New Age communities informing the growing field of conspirituality.  They\u2019ll also discuss cultic organizations being ideally positioned to sell \u201CDisaster Spirituality\u201D (props to Naomi Klein) in times of crisis. Cult leaders understand the power of charisma, the attractiveness of transcendental ideology, and what it takes to make vulnerable people feel like every question is answerable with jargon, intrusive eye contact, and deeply deceptive shit. Matthew will ground the discussion with a synopsis of cult research, basic concepts, and useful definitions.

      "description": "A recent report by the UK\u2019s Center for Countering Digital Hate found that anti-vaxx organizations reach 58 million people on social media. The total amount of money spent by anti-vax groups and advertisers targeting their followers on Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube is roughly $1 billion. The majority of the money funding the most prominent anti-vax groups is by just two men: osteopath Joseph Mercola and fund manager Bernard Selz. All of this makes you wonder: Why is so money being used to target anti-vaxxers?  Derek interviews Imran Ahmed, founder of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, about how anti-vax leaders and groups are using social media to target and recruit followers. The stakes are higher than ever, as the vaccine argument has transcended autism and is threatening to endanger public health during the pandemic.  Julian considers the vaccine fears of parents as well as the shadow of the Tuskegee Syphillis Study, and how anti-vax alliances are targeting black communities, which could be a disastrous Trojan Horse for COVID-19, while Matthew serves up his This Week in Conspirituality segment in the epilogue, looking at how the leader of the high-demand group he was indoctrinated into over 20 years ago, led by Michael Roach, is rebooting old content as a COVID-era grift.

      "description": "Percolating alongside racism and classism, one of the most pernicious subtexts of conspirituality propaganda is ableism. Proponents spout accusatory mantras like: \u201CYou have an immune system!,\u201D \u201CYou\u2019d have nothing to worry about if you were vegan!,\u201D and, of course, \u201CLiving in fear is the real cause of disease.\u201D  Not only do these ideas have nothing to do with virology, they also condemn everyone who is immuno-compromised, living in a food desert, or managing trauma to the margins. COVID-19 has exposed the ugliest secret of wellness culture: the glorification of the self over concern about the community.  None of this is news for disability activists. In this episode, Matthew interviews Jivana Heyman, founder of Accessible Yoga and longtime AIDS activist, about walking the anti-conspirituality line between yoga and public health. Heyman also reveals how the past and present intersect in Tony Fauci, a leading figure in AIDS research during Reagan\u2019s tenure who is now being muzzled by Trump.  In This Week in Conspirituality, Julian looks at the fear of death through the lens of Ernest Becker and Joseph Campbell, Derek discusses free speech after Twitter removes 7,000 QAnon accounts, and Matthew tries to empathize with the \u201Cawakened\u201D aspect of conspirituality, i.e., What have they woken up to?

      "description": "OB/GYN Dr. Christiane Northrup has been a giant in women\u2019s healthcare advocacy for decades. She has persuasively argued for lower-intervention childbirth, an end to circumcision, and policies that place family unity at the heart of health care. She\u2019s known and loved for challenging her medical training with faith-based values and an intuition framed as feminine (if not feminist) and \u201Csovereign.\u201D  Northrup draws on astrology, feng shui, chakra theory, and \u201Cvibrational\u201D healing as modes of resistance to what she sees as medical patriarchy. This resistance began seamlessly intersecting with COVID trutherism in April, when she started posting daily Facebook sermons to her half-million followers. The series is called \u201CThe Great Awakening\u201D \u2014 a phrase first used to describe 18th-century American spiritual revival movements, but was recently co-opted by QAnon conspiracists to describe the inevitable triumph of Trump over the Deep State.  Northrup\u2019s sermons, combined with her posts of Plandemic, Tony Robbins interviewing anti-vaxxers, and a podcast with \u201CAndy\u201D Wakefield in which she called COVID a \u201Cflu\u201D and expressed concern about Bill Gates taking over public education, give a rich glimpse into the seduction of conspirituality in the hands of a wellness matriarch.  Most recently, Northrup has strengthened her alignment with QAnon by posting a trailer for a follow-up to a key recruiting video. With up to a dozen QAnon supporters running for office in November, Northrup is positioned to nudge middle-class white wellness women with money into a cult that believes Trump is a messianic figure.  This week\u2019s interview is with Britt Hermes, who earned her doctorate in naturopathic medicine from Bastyr University in 2011. After three years of practice, Hermes left the profession to became its most vocal public critic. We asked her to weigh in on women\u2019s wellness in the pandemic and the appeal of Dr. Northrup.

This isn\u2019t an accident \u2014 but it\u2019s not exactly by design, either. Both figures can seem trapped in filter bubbles of jargon that hypnotizes and cancels critical thinking. In this episode, we talk with pre-eminent cult researcher Steve Hassan about his new book, The Cult of Trump, and explore the overlaps between the cults of personality that destroy political, wellness, and spiritual cultures. We discuss changes in cultic technique in the age of lockdown, and how best to maintain contact with a person transformed by manipulation. The interview with Steven begins at the 37-minute mark.

      "description": "Conspiritualists are compelling for numerous reasons: they\u2019re charismatic; they claim to transcend polarized politics; they claim to speak the unspeakable in a quest for hidden truths. It makes sense that a key rhetorical instrument in their toolbox is poetry.  \u201CThe real virus is fear\u201D is a unifying metaphor for conspiritualists, but there are others. In conspiritual-ese, the immune system is like the Christian soul: eternal, perfect, and solitary. Masks are signs of submission that symbolize the suppression of free speech and even slavery. Public health departments are bureaucracies of death. Vaccines are poisons designed to demand compliance. Vaccinators are Satanic agents compelled to enter the sacred space of the body \u2014 especially the child\u2019s body \u2014 in order to possess it.

But with no publications or experience with epidemiology, why is he being tapped by anti-vax activists to speak on COVID-19.  Perhaps because when he runs up against the limit of his knowledge, he offers spiritual sermons. J.P. Sears does something similar, though from a different direction, without being signal-boosted by anti-vaxxers. Sears\u2019s deeper colors show when he reaches the limits of his satire: he\u2019s a life coach medical libertarian who\u2019s willing to cherry-pick data and mock concerns about the immunocompromised in support of\u2026we\u2019re not quite sure.

      "description": "Barely two weeks into various stages of lockdown around the world, New Age philosopher Charles Eisenstein published a 9,000-word essay on the meaning of the pandemic. He summed up his core theme with deft wordplay at about the 7,000-word mark. After suggesting that the global crisis afforded a kind of transformative opportunity, he writes \u201CNow the question arises: Initiation into what? What is the specific nature and purpose of this initiation? The popular name for the pandemic offers a clue: coronavirus. A corona is a crown. \u2018Novel coronavirus pandemic\u2019 means \u2018a new coronation for all.\u2019 What was so captivating about this essay that Jack Dorsey tweeted it to the 4.5M followers on his platform? What are Eisenstein\u2019s premises, credentials, rhetorical techniques? What are his connections to medical libertarianism, and how does he manage to endorse conspirituality while seeming to deconstruct it?
