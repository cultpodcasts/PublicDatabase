      "description": "Matthew reconsiders past criticisms of Marianne Williamson\u2019s theology and candidacy in light of her principled call for a ceasefire as casualties in Gaza rise.\u00A0 At\u00A0 a moment of global crisis, Williamson is distinguishing herself from the vast majority of her Democratic colleagues\u2014including Bernie Sanders\u2014by calling urgently for a ceasefire as the casualties in Gaza rise. Biden Democrats are struggling to utter the word \u201Cceasefire.\u201D Rashida Tlaib and the Squad are now targeted for primary challenges funded by AIPAC. Will it fall to a New Age pacifist\u2014long derided as \u201Cthe crystal lady\u201D\u2014to challenge the geopolitical status quo? Is Williamson\u0027s proposed \u201CDepartment of Peace\u201D really that naive at this point, now that Mike Johnson, as House Speaker, holds the Evangelical view that war in the Holy Land is a sign of Jesus\u0027s return?

      "description": "Butcherbox promo: Sign up today at butcherbox.com/conspirituality and use code conspirituality to choose your free steak for a year and get $20 off. RKF Jr., who has campaigned as the peace candidate who will draw down the US military empire, has recently called Israel America\u2019s \u201Caircraft carrier\u201D in the Middle East. When challenged to call for a ceasefire as the casualties rise in Gaza, the self-proclaimed protector of children said, \u201Cnobody likes children dying,\u201D but then compared Israel\u2019s efforts against Hamas to Alliance efforts against the Nazis. On Gaza and Israel, RFK Jr is sounding unlike the end-the-forever wars, bring-our-troops-home candidate that many of his followers in the alternative health, anti-vax, and New Age spiritual communities thought they were supporting. Now he\u2019s paying the price. Lifelong pacifist Dennis Kucinich quit the Kennedy24 campaign nine days after Israel began its retaliation for the Hamas attacks. RFK Jr.\u2019s Director of Messaging, Charles Eisenstein, is speaking out against his boss\u2019s one-sided stance. And alternative health and anti-vax mogul Sayer Ji has withdrawn his endorsement in a newsletter sent out to 300K subscribers. Matthew reports on the developments and poses the questions: What is it about Gaza that suddenly makes the mainstream media reports credible to conspiritualists\u2014as opposed to the news from Ukraine, or about COVID? And if RFK Jr. loses the support of the natural health pacifist who first backed him, who is he left to stand with? Show Notes Dennis Kucinich Leaves Robert F.

      "description": "Iman Gadzhi is a rising YouTube superstar. A high school dropout and supposed self-made multimillionaire, the 23 year-old marketing guru started his YouTube channel at age 15 with weightlifting videos. He has since built a following of 3.7 million. His life and career path is symbiotic with the platform, mirroring, monetizing, and accelerating every self-help and get-rich trend that blows through through the algorithms.\u00A0 At some point during COVID, he caught the conspiracy theory bug, and turned his channel into a red pill factory, pumping out such volumes of aggressively paranoid content that YouTube money bros started comparing him to Andrew Tate.\u00A0 Now, Gadzhi is reaching more aggressively into the brains of pre-teen boys around the world with a morbid fantasy about the origins of public education, and how it dooms them all into woke slavery. But it\u2019s not just a conspiracy theory. It\u2019s a highly-structured marketing campaign pitching his online sales coaching scheme as a substitute for high school.

Alt-right rabble-rouser and pseudo-intellectual, Steve Bannon, was part of the team that salvaged Trump\u2019s floundering 2016 campaign.

He can earnestly identify with and fight in court for dispossessed tribes on American soil, while doubling down on morbid power imbalances abroad.

      "description": "Naomi Klein\u2019s Doppelganger: A Trip into the Mirror World is a polymathic work that serves up new political heuristics with the firepower we\u2019ve come to expect from the coiner of \u201Cdisaster capitalism.\u201D A Dante-spiral through our circles of cultural hell, it\u2019s also a memoir of demoralization, self-evaluation, and persistent hope. If this sounds overly ambitious or grandiose\u2014that\u2019s a fair suspicion in this age of galaxy-brained pundits who want to write *that book about everything.* In less humble, less feminist hands, a project like this could feel like a vanity vehicle for an author\u2019s unbearably brilliant mind. But that doesn\u2019t happen here, because Klein\u2019s intersectional discipline\u2014which despite many flights of fancy, she never abandons\u2014serves the values of economic, racial, and climate justice, and she does it by always citing her sources and elevating the voices of the marginalized. Derek, Julian, and Matthew discuss briefly before Klein joins Matthew to discuss her way into and out of this bizarre and demoralizing land.

      "description": "Doppelganger: A Trip into the Mirror World is an exuberant, polymathic effort, in which Klein develops several new political heuristics that pack the punch we\u2019ve come to expect from the originator of \u201Cdisaster capitalism.\u201D Reading it is like getting walloped by a novel political theory virus\u2014 or a potent vaccine for the times. It\u2019s also a Dante-esque spiral down through our endless circles of historical and cultural hell. Klein\u2019s core subject is the \u201CMirror World\u201D we now battle in: a place where our digital avatars occlude our bodies, where morbid fantasies blot out fact-checked histories, where the fool\u2019s gold of influencers outshines the daily work of researchers. It\u2019s a place where antimaskers steal the \u201CI can\u2019t breathe\u201D cry of George Floyd, and antivax influencers pretend they are being led to the gas chambers. It\u2019s a place where selfish demagogues appropriate and mimic the poetry of social justice, but only for a select few. It\u2019s where MAGA movement architect Steve Bannon LARPs as a therapist for the common man.  Doppelganger has landed like a Rosetta Stone for divining the incoherent politics of the figures we\u2019ve covered all these years\u2014and the cultural and moral vacuums they fill. But most surprisingly\u2014and we think our listenership will be grateful for this\u2014this rich memoir of demoralization and self-evaluation also offers a deep undercurrent of persistent hope.\u00A0 \uFEFFSign up today at butcherbox.com/CONSPIRITUALITY and use code CONSPIRITUALITY to get two 100% grass-fed filet mignons and two wild-caught lobster tails for FREE in your first box plus $20 off your first order.

Esme asked if we would like to discuss the strange and taboo overlaps between yoga, wellness, neo-tantra, and sex work. I wrote back immediately to say yes.\u00A0 Esme has worked as a professional dominatrix and kink provider for the past twenty years. In 2012, she began teaching yoga and investigating the intersection of sex work and spirituality through her practice and writing. She lives and works in NYC, and is now doing academic work in textiles. Matthew spoke to her while she was on a research trip to Indonesia.\u00A0 We think you\u2019ll all learn a ton from this conversation about transparent vs. non-transparent labour practices, performative intimacy, the gendered inequalities of wellness work, and how Neo-Tantrics who use handguns in their foreplay made their presence known at the January 6th insurrection.

      "description": "Deep Cut pulls from our bonus episode archive to unearth previous ideas that remain relevant today. News from Alabama: after a 23-year ban on yoga in schools, generated by a Republican moral panic, Governor Kay Ivey signs a bill that lets kids do yoga again, but with some restrictions: \u0022All instruction in yoga shall be limited exclusively to poses, exercises, and stretching techniques. All poses shall be limited exclusively to sitting, standing, reclining, twisting, and balancing. All poses, exercises, and stretching techniques shall have exclusively English descriptive names. Chanting, mantras, mudras, use of mandalas, induction of hypnotic states, guided imagery, and namaste greetings shall be expressly prohibited.\u0022 Those who promote yoga as universal goodwill welcome this Indian art form being made more accessible for children in a State with terrible educational markers. Hindu nationalists, on the other hand, might be outraged at a secularized version of yoga, stripped not only of references to Hinduism but of signs of any type of Indian spirituality.\u00A0And a lot of white yoga progressives will look at this policy\u2014mostly from the urban North\u2014 and worry about authenticity and appropriation. How will the children feel? In considering who wins and loses with this new development, Matthew reviews recent U.S. yoga-war history: battles between the Hindu American Foundation and Yoga Journal, the rise of Christian non-yoga-yoga \u0022Praise Moves\u0022, and Encinitas Union School District got sued for allegedly violating the Establishment Clause by contracting devotees of Pattabhi Jois to teach the kids yoga. It\u0027s not a stretch to see an overlap between this theme and the medical-moral panic over vaccines. In both cases, the focus is on the imagined corruption of children, whether by poison, politics, or inner quiet.

His work has appeared in the New York Times, NBC News, Politico, Rolling Stone, Huffpost, and many other outlets.\u00A0 Bradley got personally drawn into evangelical Christianity as a teenager\u2014and from a secular family\u2014and had the strange experience of burying his part-Japanese heritage in a white coded, Christian Nationalist identity. It took him years of scholarship to see how this political ideology had been baked into the religious indoctrination. Now he\u2019s a religious studies scholar, doing work in the world from that perspective. And his struggles with all of this stuff have brought his empathy and his humility up to the surface in really profound ways.\u00A0 Bradley has a lot of family history in Maui, and on his behalf and for people there who have just survived a catastrophic fire and now must bury their dead and rebuild, we would like to encourage you to consider donating to the Maui Mutual Aid Fund.\u00A0 Show Notes Straight White American Jesus Preparing for War: The Extremist History of White Christian Nationalism--and What Comes Next Go to HelloFresh.com/50conspirituality and use code 50conspirituality for 50% off plus free shipping.

Exploring online fever swamps and tripping over deranged historical facts that make conspiracy theories sound sane.\u201D The digital soldiers of QAnonAnonymous Podcast subjected themselves to the most cursed content the internet has to offer. But the real world they traveled through was just as smelly. They went to live QAnon protests, parades, and conferences. They conducted the first interviews with the QAnon Shaman. They attended ball-slapping workshops to raise their testosterone for the Great Awakening. They caught COVID many, many times, all for the cause. And now, as their reward, they get to see their favorite redpilled celebrity, and Mel Gibson\u0027s favorite Jesus, Jim Caviezel, star in the fake-u-mentary, \u0022Sound of Freedom.\u0022 It\u2019s been a long road to Hollywood for our guests Travis View and Jake Rockatansky, but this is their red-carpet moment where we get to ask them: How did they like working on this show?

And many of these episodes are super informative and inspirational.\u00A0 And yet, at times it seems like Huberman is sacrificing quality for quantity. This week, we look at three instances in which Andrew Huberman appears to be speaking outside of his lane, or perhaps overhyping supplements for his own benefit, and we want to know what else is being sacrificed along the way. McGill Office for Science and Society science communicator, Jonathan Jarry, joins the discussion.

When the QAnon Shaman got dressed on the morning of January 6, he put on his red, white, and blue face paint, his postmodern quasi-Native American horned fur hat, and grabbed the spear to which he had attached an American flag. In performance mode, this cosplay persona had already garnered him a taste of the attention that would soon increase exponentially as he became the most recognizable figure of the Capitol Riot.\u00A0 In today\u2019s Bonus, Julian argues that his costume, as well as his ritual\u00A0 actions on that day were also an expression of a political worldview, run through with deeply held spiritual beliefs about the world and his role in it. The history of political religion, propagandistic conspiracies, and progressive spiritual convictions may show that\u2014far from being trivial\u2014belief is at the heart of the American, and perhaps the human, story.

This week, Matthew sets pseudoscience and spiritual bypassing into the social context of cultic relationships, reviewing some of the tortured dynamics we monitored during COVID, laying out a few cult-resistant hygiene rules, some pointers on avoiding stigmatization, and asking tough questions about where the whole cult discourse thing is going in this parasocial era.

The vaccines failed, and besides, they were super dangerous. COVID obviously came out of a lab. Masks were useless, and the lock-downs were completely unnecessary forms of totalitarian oppression. The authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, who were censored on social media, were right all along. Not so fast. Our guest today is Dr. Jonathan Howard, who not only did grueling service at Bellevue Hospital in NYC (as the first wave raged, and corpses were stacked in meat trucks) but has put in the time to create a comprehensive document of how contrarian doctors shaped cultural perceptions during the pandemic. He takes the title of his new book, We Want Them Infected, from a quote found in a series of emails from July 2020. Trump-appointed science-advisor to the HHS, Paul Alexander, urged officials there and at the FDA, and the CDC, to pursue a herd immunity strategy for COVID-19. \u0022There is no other way,\u0022 he wrote. \u0022We need to establish herd, and it only comes about when we allow non-high-risk groups to expose themselves to the virus. PERIOD. Infants, kids, teens, young people, middle-aged with no conditions have zero to little risk. So we use them to develop herd. We want them infected.\u0022 Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "Marianne Williamson? Inexperienced? Not at all. In fact, she does have a ton of experience\u2026 in New Age, on-stage pseudotherapy, where she solves the problems of the troubled with memorized lines from A Course in Miracles. She\u2019s been doing these sessions at workshops and retreats for decades, and the schtick is always the same: if only the person would change their minds about their problem, the world would be healed.\u00A0 While this may fly on the workshop circuit, if you listen carefully you\u2019ll hear that she gives the same answer on the stump. It comes through most clearly when she\u2019s pressed on questions of strategy. She will instantly pivot to talking about the spirit and the soul. The effect is a disarming oscillation between the political and the personal. Are we talking about defeating fascists? No, no, that\u2019s too worldly! We\u2019re talking about opening our hearts. And if that feels good during a politically tense exchange, it\u2019s because she changed the subject. To see how this sleight-of-hand works, Matthew examines two classic Williamson encounters to show that the answers she gives on the stump aren\u2019t much different from the answers she gives on her New Age retreats.\u00A0 Show Notes That Time Byron Katie Gaslit a Follower about Trump | by Matthew Remski\u00A0 I\u0027m Afraid of Trump\u2014The Work of Byron Katie Being Rejected for Your Spiritual Beliefs | Q\u0026A With Marianne Williamson\u00A0 Mindfulness can make you selfish: A pioneering new study examines the social effects of mindfulness\u00A0 Marianne Williamson with TYT\u0027s John Iadarola \u0026 Francesca Fiorentini Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "Is Marianne Williamson\u2019s promotion of A Course in Miracles any more relevant to her political persona than Biden\u2019s Catholicism? If it demonstrably informs her every instinct and communication (as we expect it would given she sermonizes out of it every day), then yes, it is. If it leads her to suggest that meditation can help contain nuclear waste, divert hurricanes, heal the \u201Cscam\u201D of clinical depression, or \u201Cboost the immune system\u201D against COVID19, then yes, it is.\u00A0 Is it sexist to highlight Williamson\u2019s reported history of interpersonal abusiveness, when male politicians get away with far worse? There is definitely a double standard to resist. But when a candidate builds a political persona on being a love-and-light wayshower, it\u2019s important to evaluate what that actually looks like ground-level. It\u2019s also important to consider whether immature behavior might be a plausible outcome of following the Jesus of A Course in Miracles, who is a huge asshole.\u00A0 Finally: if Williamson is the only candidate out there talking about reparations and M4A, is it reactionary to dismiss her on religious or behavioral grounds? Not if you\u2019re actually interested in a functional progressive politics, free from magical thinking and charismatic bafflement.\u00A0 Show Notes Williamson\u2019s COVID meditation, Facebook Live Read: Pope Francis\u2019 May prayer to Mary for the end of the pandemic | America Magazine Marianne Williamson\u2019s \u2018abusive\u2019 treatment of 2020 campaign staff, revealed - POLITICO\u00A0 Marianne Williamson is a controversial AIDS-crisis figure for gay men.

      "description": "Recording the audiobook at a swanky Toronto studio sends Matthew down a memory hole to wonder about performance, self-awareness, and anxiety, and their relation to charisma. \u201CWhatever charisma I have or project into the world has always been both prompted and tempered by the belief that becoming larger, that reaching out and creating an impression would soothe a confused or immature sense of self. That if I could be seen, I would be loved, and if loved, I would be real. \u201CIf there is an anxiety at the core of the influencers we study, it might be related to this. This week I had the opportunity to meditate on it, to remember how charisma formed around and within me, first through an arts education, and then as a yoga and wellness entrepreneur. It\u2019s made me wonder whether and how I\u2019ve been that much different than Zach Bush, or Mikki Willis, or Katie Griggs.

      "description": "Conspiritualists are not wrong that Jeffery Epstein\u2019s downline has so far evaded justice. Or that the highest levels of the Catholic Church aided and abetted child sexual abuse for generations. They are not wrong about the existence of child sexual abuse materials circulating online, and that children are coerced, abducted, and sometimes killed in order to make them.\u00A0 But their narratives are contorted by panic, mythology, stereotypes, paranoid and grandiose assumptions, and the antisemitic conspiracy theorizing of QAnon, which spread like wildfire through yoga and wellness social media during the pandemic and has now normalized as the \u201Cgroomer\u201D meme. They say that child sexual abuse is a planned, nefarious, top-down attack on innocents. They say that its purpose is to turn the world away from God, to starve humanity of hope. Matthew sits down with H\u00E5kon H\u00F8ydal, an investigative journalist in Norway who has spent years researching and exposing the most abject behaviors on the dark web. His work reveals a very different landscape.

      "description": "Matthew sits down with Sam Binkley, Professor of Sociology at Emerson College in Boston to discuss his 2007 book Getting Loose: Lifestyle Consumption in the 1970s. We cited this very helpful work as we dug into the sociology of conspirituality for our own upcoming book. Here\u2019s a thumbnail of Binkley\u2019s argument: The 1970s ushered in a period of \u201Cgetting loose\u201D in relation to the body, work expectations, family relations, and political allegiances. This happened as the great moral and political questions of the 1960s deflated without resolution, even as they enshrined looser social mores around sex and finding meaningful work. The cultural yearning for structural change found its home in the project of the self, facilitated by an accelerated consumerism that expanded the conflation of agency with consumption. Getting Loose characterizes this inward turn as a retreat from the terrors of revolutionary freedom.

The pole star for this low-dopamine, low-cortisol, non-true-crime, survivor-centred documentary is Daniel Levin\u2019s painful and radiant memoir, Slonim Woods 9. In 2010, Levin was drawn into an extended-family domestic abuse group led by Larry Ray, the father of one of his friends at Sarah Lawrence College. It took him years to leave, years to begin to recover, and years to become the de facto subject coordinator for this film.  Matthew talks with Zach and Daniel about what it takes to really listen to survivors of group abuse, and how the arts of memoir and documentary can be doorways to reconnection and integration.  In an interview debrief, Julian and Matthew discuss why reviewing Stolen Youth is such a relief in the current Wild West cultsploitation landscape.

Actually, I mean, Jan 6 was the most peaceful gathering of a million patriots in history. Wait, hold on: Jan 6 was an antifa operative to act as cover for the fact that the election was, indeed, stolen.\u00A0 Do any of these stories sound familiar? Now imagine hearing them all, and dozens more like them, all in the same day, and you\u2019ll get a glimpse of what Daily Show correspondent and host of the podcast, Fingers the Conspiracy, Jordan Klepper, endures on a regular basis. Today Jordan joins us to talk about the cursed world of conspiracies that he\u2019s witnessed, up close and in person, with the people who spread them, what it was like to be at the Capitol on Jan 6, and the bewildering intersection of comedy and politics.\u00A0 -- -- -- Support us on Patreon  Pre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada  Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | Julian  Original music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "Perhaps you\u2019ve seen the Rumi quote repeated on social media memes: \u201CThe wound is the place where the Light enters you.\u201D The wounded healer is a popular archetype in wellness spaces, and indeed, sometimes experience teaches wisdom, enabling the victim to overcome their trauma and help others. But in conspiritualist spaces, the wounded healer can also begin a monetization stream where everything becomes evidence of trauma, only to be healed through this book, or that course, or a brand-new brand of meditation that\u2019s only the marketing scheme of an old form. Speaking of brands, we look at the wounded healer through the lens of Russell Brand, among others. This leads to Derek\u2019s interview with YouTuber and podcaster, Chris Boutte, aka The Rewired Soul, who happens to be in recovery and watched firsthand as Russell went from helpful figure to shadowy archetype. Can an addiction to drugs be healed, only to lead to an addiction to clicks and likes?

Which means that in addition to any of the colds, flu, and COVID strains circulating, many of our listeners may still be in recovery mode from family time.  We\u0027re specifically referring to political tensions over the holiday dinner table. You know, the vegan sister insisting on a land acknowledgment before the QAnon uncle says grace, while the anti-vax aunt rants at her to take off her mask. Can somebody pass the apple pie?  Our guest today is journalist, author, and political analyst, Anand Giridharadas. Julian spoke with him about his new book, The Persuaders, in which he profiles people on the ground working to change minds, bridge divisions and fight for democracy. The Persuaders offers inspiration to those who refuse to accept that a rigid polarization in which no one ever changes their mind, is the new normal.

This is episode 9 of the Swan Song Series 9.The basic premise of The Courage to Heal, by creative writing instructors Ellen Bass and Laura Davis,\u00A0 is that memories of childhood abuse, especially child sexual abuse, can be recovered and articulated by survivors who are given the proper space, tools, and validation. The book explores how this be facilitated within the context of journaling, writing poetry, and writing memoir, and what the therapeutic benefits of full confessional articulation can be.While countless people affirm that this book was a lifeline during a time in which recovery resources for child abuse survivors were rare,\u00A0 there are substantial problems with the book\u0027s method, claims about memory, dodgy sources, and endorsement of outright Satanic Panic propaganda.

Girl, Interrupted is a freewheeling adaptation of a 1993 memoir by Susanna Kaysen about the 18 months she spent undergoing treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder in a Massachusetts psychiatric facility in the late 1960s. This episode 8 of the Swan Song Series.This study is provoked by a memory recounted by Swan\u0027s childhood friend, Diana Hansen Ribera, that Swan identified with the character of Lisa Rowe in the film. Angelina Jolie won an Oscar for her searing performance of Rowe, a sociopath. In this second episode, we explore several characters that Swan may have (and may yet) identify with, discuss the awkwardness of portraying mental health narratives on the big screen, and what it would really take for such an intense film to be digestible for typical teenagers. Matthew ends with a meditation on immersive/claustrophobic media\u2014which Swan goes on to master\u2014compared with the relief of developing a meta-view capable of inhabiting many stories, as opposed to imitating one.Show NotesSENECA THE YOUNGER, HERCULES FURENS - Theoi Classical Texts LibraryHercules (Seneca)Girl, Interrupted \u2014 Susanna Kaysen1607: Growing up with Teal Swan - Diana Hansen RiberaMad, Bad, and Sad: Women and the Mind Doctors by Lisa AppignanesiBrittany Murphy: Inside Her Sudden Death at 32 That Still Confounds Hollywood -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

That trend has only intensified in recent months, with grifters like Peter McCullough and Mikki Willis getting in on the supplement game. In part three of his trilogy on supplements, Derek talks with dietician Kevin Klatt about what supplements are actually good for\u2014as well as how this unregulated industry is monetizing fears around future viruses. They also discuss the wild west of nootropics, supposed brain-enhancing substances that don\u2019t scare you about pandemics, but instead make you believe that with just a little more optimization you\u2019ll be the most perfect you possible\u2026until another product drop, that is. To discuss the world of lack that other influencers capitalize on, we\u2019ll discuss the annual A Fest, a TED-style wellness gathering for millionaires that banks on you never actually feeling content in your life, but instead chasing a promise of unachievable eternal betterment.

Worse still, we\u0027re supposedly defending \u0022groomers\u0022 and \u0022child mutilation.\u0022  Meanwhile literal swastika flag-waving Nazis, as well as Proud Boys, Patriot Front, and other armed militia-types are increasingly showing up outside LGBTQ venues across the country.

This is episode 7 of the Swan Song Series.This study is provoked by a memory recounted by Swan\u0027s childhood friend, Diana Hansen Ribera, that Swan identified with the character of Lisa Rowe in the film.

      "description": "The homestretch of our study of Michelle Remembers zeroes in on the literal symbols\u2014and symbols gone literal\u2014of the Satanic Panic. (This is episode 6 of\u00A0 the Swan Song Series.)Archetypes, gore, anxieties about sex and babies and filth: Lawrence Pazder mined it all, using modes of abstraction and dehumanization as old as religion itself to weave a story he claimed was all about Michelle\u2014but was really an exercise of his own fetishes.Michelle Smith could have received proper care for her understandable stresses. She could have offered up her feelings and sensations and images from dreams for discussion and contemplation, and an actual therapist would have held that material safely for her to explore. But in Pazder, Smith found someone who wasn\u2019t interested in common human complexity. He was interested in cosmic warfare, and the role he could LARP within it.But Pazder was so blind to his craven narcissism that he couldn\u2019t help but tell on himself. In the final passage we analyze, Pazder records Smith demanding to end therapy. \u201CIf I could tear out my tongue,\u201D she says, \u201CI would never have to speak again.\u201D But in the very next paragraph, the man who is forcing her to \u201Cremember\u201D symbolically tears out her tongue, rejecting her plea to end the sessions, interpreting her demand as though it were coming from Satan himself.She imagines herself getting in a car and driving and driving, anywhere. Away from this psychiatrist who wanted to be an exorcist, away from his story, perhaps to find her own.

      "description": "An ancient text at the root of the culture that gave birth to the yoga tradition says that if an outcaste person\u2014a Dalit\u2014dares to learn the holy language of Sanskrit, they must be tortured. Molten lead must be poured into their ears. Their tongue must be cut out. In the Ramayana, a Shudra (caste oppressed) who dared to practice yoga was murdered so that the sickly child of a priestly family might regain his health. In the Mahabharata, an Adivasi (South Asian Indigenous) boy is commanded to cut off his own thumb for the sin of being self-taught and skilled above his station. The pious are told that these obscene retributions maintain the divine order.Indian wisdom traditions have globalized to the extent that its evangelists have laundered the spiritualization of caste-based violence, and hidden its history from erstwhile progressives. Many of those evangelists have either been caste privileged, or caste apologists. The yoga they constructed for export has become a form of soft power, serving Hindu nationalist objectives.\u00A0 \u00A0The Trauma of Caste: A Dalit Feminist Meditation on Survivorship, Healing, and Abolition by Thenmozhi Soundararajan puts this history under a microscope. It pulls back the curtain on the carceral impacts of terms like dharma and karma, and concepts like purity, pollution, and reincarnation. In terms of our work here at Conspirituality, Soundararajan\u0027s text cuts through the romantic Orientalism used by influencers, cult leaders, and nationalists to exploit emotional vulnerabilities. It also points to\u2014and updates\u2014a vision of spiritual practice first articulated by the Dalit leader B. R. Ambedkar, rooted in the ancient Buddhist call to compassion and equality.

      "description": "Matthew and Julian sit down for the first of a two-part examination of the 1988 bestseller at the heart of the recovered memory movement\u2014which played a central role in validating Satanic Panic testimonials.The basic premise of The Courage to Heal, by creative writing instructors Ellen Bass and Linda Davis,\u00A0 is that memories of childhood abuse, especially child sexual abuse, can be recovered and articulated by survivors who are given the proper space, tools, and validation. The book explores how this be facilitated within the context of journaling, writing poetry, and writing memoir, and what the therapeutic benefits of full confessional articulation can be.While countless people affirm that this book was a lifeline during a time in which recovery resources for child abuse survivors were rare,\u00A0 there are substantial problems with the book\u0027s method, claims about memory, dodgy sources, and endorsement of outright Satanic Panic propaganda.

We then explore the front matter: how Pazder introduces his project (and himself), and the ambivalent endorsement of Remi de Roo, Archbishop of Victoria. In Pazder\u0027s many clerical alliances, a crucial theme is established: the rapprochement between psychiatry and the priesthood, in which the former submits to the latter to restore the reality of the supernatural.We also look at the pre-emptively defensive\u00A0 intro penned by the publisher, Thomas B. Congdon Jr. He claimed to have verified the substance of the book through interviews, and thought that Pazder and Smith were very earnest and forthcoming people when he hosted them for editorial meetings.

Joining the panel are Peter Staudenmaier, professor of modern Germany history at Marquette, and Rebecca Carter-Chand, historian at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.

In the hands and eyes of a documentarian like Amy Berg we find a journalistic commitment to the truth combined with the artistry of compelling and intimate story-telling.\u00A0 Along the way, her projects are guided by an obsession with\u00A0 justice. In two cases\u2014that of the West Memphis Three, and more recently the murder trial of Adnen Syed\u2014 her film-making played a role in changing the real-world narrative; leading to the release of those wrongfully convicted via cultural bias, moral panic, and conspiracy theories. In other instances Amy\u0027s work has embodied investigative journalism to show how real conspiracies hide the awful abuse of innocents, while protecting the powerful. We ask her how she measures her instincts against the evidence, how she gains the trust of people who have been ignored for decades, how she managed to log days of interview time with an abusive ex-priest, and how she keeps her mental health intact amidst all the uncertainty.

Girl, Interrupted is a freewheeling adaptation of a 1993 memoir by Susanna Kaysen about the 18 months she spent undergoing treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder in a Massachusetts psychiatric facility in the late 1960s.This study is provoked by a memory recounted by Swan\u0027s childhood friend, Diana Hansen Ribera, that Swan identified with the character of Lisa Rowe in the film. Angelina Jolie won an Oscar for her searing performance of Rowe, a sociopath. In this second episode, we explore several characters that Swan may have (and may yet) identify with, discuss the awkwardness of portraying mental health narratives on the big screen, and what it would really take for such an intense film to be digestible for typical teenagers. Matthew ends with a meditation on immersive/claustrophobic media\u2014which Swan goes on to master\u2014compared with the relief of developing a meta-view capable of inhabiting many stories, as opposed to imitating one.Show NotesSENECA THE YOUNGER, HERCULES FURENS - Theoi Classical Texts Library Hercules (Seneca)Girl, Interrupted \u2014 Susanna Kaysen1607: Growing up with Teal Swan - Diana Hansen RiberaMad, Bad, and Sad: Women and the Mind Doctors by Lisa AppignanesiBrittany Murphy: Inside Her Sudden Death at 32 That Still Confounds Hollywood -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "There\u0027s no Teal Swan without the Satanic Panic. And there\u0027s no Satanic Panic without the 1980 publication of Michelle Remembers, by Lawrence Pazder and Michelle Smith.In this first of three segments on this melted book, Matthew and Julian cover its historical, cultural, and mass media context. We start with a review of a 1985 20/20 episode called \u201CThe Devil Worshippers\u201D for a taste of how mainstream outlets hosted cranks like Pazder, giving him a hall pass on evidence, and overlooking how his Catholic fetishes and paranoias played a huge role in the fictions he spun. The post Vatican 2 context is crucial, especially as we bear witness to the current political triumphs of Trad-Cath propaganda and politics in our post-Roe, QAnon -fried world. For help, we look to an excellent essay by social historian Bernard Doherty about the genre and elements of the Catholic Horror Film, which begins with Rosemary\u0027s Baby in 1968. This reactionary genre attempted to respond to modernizing\u2014or postmodernizing, as Jordan Peterson might say\u2014changes in Church doctrine. Bottom line? The Satanic Panic largely begins in and is sustained by Catholic-flavoured conspirituality anxiety about secularization, sex, babies, and abortion. CORRECTIONS: My dad informs me that I\u0027ve made some Pope mistakes! Pius X was the last legitimate Pope according to the sedavacantists, and John XXIII, not Paul XXIII, opened the Vatican 2 proceedings. Thx dad.

      "description": "Some of the most valuable material that come to us from Paula Marino\u0027s Open Shadow film of 2017 is an extended interview with Swan\u0027s parent\u0027s, the Bosworths. They speak about Swan\u0027s sensory sensitivity as a young child, and how that morphed into a staunchly independent but sometimes isolated social life. They describe Swan\u0027s secret runic writing, their belief in her capacities as a medical intuitive, and discuss the gaps in psychiatric care that failed them all when her mental health needed help. This episode examines this interview, and then cross-checks some aspects against the account of Swan\u0027s childhood friend, Diana Hansen Ribera.Here we have the unique insight into parents speaking vulnerably and transparently about their baffling child\u2014which means we can really lean into the primal material that pre-exists the charged questions about whether Teal Swan is\u00A0 running a cult or encouraging suicide. What we find, between the accounts of the Bosworths and Ribera, is a collection of commonplace phenomena: high sensitivity, parents learning as they go, the intrusion of internet pornography, and a likely abusive figure who was too close to the family.In this episode, Matthew and Julian discuss the mystery of familial memory, idealizing vs. pathologizing children, the appeals of fantasy as a mode of relief, whether the Satanic Panic was a collective cry for help to resolve commonplace domestic and community abuse, and the possibility that cult formation is a social form of post traumatic play.

Yet she could never shake her journalistic chops, and so she ended up writing about the wellness industry for the NY Times, the LA Times, Fast Company, and other publications. Her skeptical eye and earnest curiosity lead her to write her brand new book, The Gospel of Wellness: Gyms, Gurus, Goop, and the False Promise of Self-Care.

Together, Geyser and Weier came to believe that Slenderman was demanding a sacrifice in exchange for his protection. Their crime,\u00A0 at once na\u00EFve and brutal,\u00A0 sparked a moral panic. Author Kathleen Hale joins Matthew to discuss her reporting on this story in her riveting and compassionate new book, Slenderman: Online Obsession, Mental Illness, and the Violent Crime of Two Midwestern Girls.Slenderman is brimming with tenderness for these girls, who are all creative, confused, scared, and ultimately bound to each other through social contagion and mental illness. Hale\u0027s writing is accessible but elliptical as it uncovers jagged details, but never easy answers, about a world that predicts our own.\u00A0 On this podcast we spend a lot of time on the virtual demons that animate conspirituality and QAnon, driving some devotees to violence. Hale\u0027s work is good medicine for those who know that internet chaos and mental precarity will remain locked in feedback loops for the foreseeable future. Her meticulous investigation\u2014enriched by hours spent interviewing Morgan Geyser\u2014shows that the road to understanding is always paved with empathy.

Beginning with her own transformational moment after 9/11, Kerri has long asked difficult questions of both herself and the industry she\u2019s spent decades immersed in. In fact, while Derek and Julian were co-founding the Conspirituality pre-cursor, YogaBrains, over a decade ago, Kerri was an integral member of yoga-activist organization, Off the Mat, Into the World.

      "description": "The homestretch of our study of Michelle Remembers zeroes in on the literal symbols\u2014and symbols gone literal\u2014of the Satanic Panic. Archetypes, gore, anxieties about sex and babies and filth: Lawrence Pazder mined it all, using modes of abstraction and dehumanization as old as religion itself to weave a story he claimed was all about Michelle\u2014but was really an exercise of his own fetishes.Michelle Smith could have received proper care for her understandable stresses. She could have offered up her feelings and sensations and images from dreams for discussion and contemplation, and an actual therapist would have held that material safely for her to explore. But in Pazder, Smith found someone who wasn\u2019t interested in common human complexity. He was interested in cosmic warfare, and the role he could LARP within it.But Pazder was so blind to his craven narcissism that he couldn\u2019t help but tell on himself. In the final passage we analyze, Pazder records Smith demanding to end therapy. \u201CIf I could tear out my tongue,\u201D she says, \u201CI would never have to speak again.\u201D But in the very next paragraph, the man who is forcing her to \u201Cremember\u201D symbolically tears out her tongue, rejecting her plea to end the sessions, interpreting her demand as though it were coming from Satan himself.She imagines herself getting in a car and driving and driving, anywhere. Away from this psychiatrist who wanted to be an exorcist, away from his story, perhaps to find her own.

      "description": "Fitness is the beating heart of America. No, wait, that\u2019s opportunistic capitalism. But opportunistic capitalism, as it turns out, is the beating heart of fitness. Yet fitness has a soul too\u2014in fact, mysticism, capitalism, and fitness have been dancing together for a very long time, while politics calls the tune, as historian and assistant professor at The New School, Natalia Petrzela, is here to tell us about today. We should also note that Natalia is our only four-time guest.She\u2019s also the author of an incredible new book, to be published this December by the University of Chicago Press, titled Fit Nation: The Gains and Pains of America\u2019s Exercise Obsession. The book spans over a hundred years, chronicling shifting cultural attitudes, gendered expectations, political inflections, and jackpot innovations in how Americans have celebrated, reviled, bought, sold, and been turned-on or enlightened by rituals of exercise.Like us, Natalia loves physical culture, but contradictions abound in the collisions between embodiment, politics, and commerce. If, as the marketing has told us over the years, recreational running is better for the mind than psychotherapy, moonlit naked hottubing at Esalen can save the world, women can simultaneously embrace dance studio fitness as a path of feminist liberation and a way to titilate the male gaze, and yoga can promise freedom from ever needing drugs or surgery, is it any wonder that a country so obsessed with exercise is so notoriously unhealthy?Show NotesFit Nation: The Gains and Pains of America\u2019s Exercise ObsessionFrom Performance to Participation: The Origins of the Fit NationWorking On The Work of Working Out: A history of fitness in America -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "In this episode of the Swan Song Series, Matthew interviews Paola Marino about why she found Teal Swan a fascinating subject to film for 2018\u2019s \u201COpen Shadow.\u201D They discuss aesthetics, the mystery of personality, why Swan\u2019s parents agreed to sit down with her. Matthew also surprised her with the newly-revealed translations of Swan\u2019s coded journal pages.Prefacing the interview is a discussion between Julian and Matthew about art, artifice, the risks of doing and not doing hard journalism on the subjects we cover. They discuss James Joyce\u2019s proverb about noble art, in which he describes \u201Caesthetic arrest\u201D as the middle way between propaganda and pornography.Marino\u2019s work attempts to find that path, while Jon Kasbe\u2019s The Deep End falters to both sides. On one hand Kasbe\u2019s film titillates viewers with high drama. On the other hand it tells viewers what they should think. And in both cases it creates a story where the truth would suffice.The feelings excited by improper art are kinetic, desire or loathing. Desire urges us to possess, to go to something; loathing urges us to abandon, to go from something. These are kinetic emotions. The arts which excite them, pornographical or didactic, are therefore improper arts. The esthetic emotion (I use the general term) is therefore static. The mind is arrested and raised above desire and loathing. \u2014James Joyce, Portrait of the Artist as a Young ManShow Notes Open Shadow\u2014Paola MarinoGizmodo Launches \u0027The Gateway,\u0027 an Investigative Podcast About a Controversial Internet Spiritual Guru -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

In Pazder\u0027s many clerical alliances, a crucial theme is established: the rapprochement between psychiatry and the priesthood, in which the former submits to the latter to restore the reality of the supernatural. We also look at the pre-emptively defensive\u00A0 intro penned by the publisher, Thomas B. Congdon Jr. He claimed to have verified the substance of the book through interviews, and thought that Pazder and Smith were very earnest and forthcoming people when he hosted them for editorial meetings.

And there\u0027s no Satanic Panic without the 1980 publication of Michelle Remembers, by Lawrence Pazder and Michelle Smith.In this first of three segments on this melted book, Matthew and Julian cover its historical, cultural, and mass media context. We start with a review of a 1985 20/20 episode called \u201CThe Devil Worshippers\u201D for a taste of how mainstream outlets hosted cranks like Pazder, giving him a hall pass on evidence, and overlooking how his Catholic fetishes and paranoias played a huge role in the fictions he spun. The post Vatican 2 context is crucial, especially as we bear witness to the current political triumphs of Trad-Cath propaganda and politics in our post-Roe, QAnon -fried world. For help, we look to an excellent essay by social historian Bernard Doherty about the genre and elements of the Catholic Horror Film, which begins with Rosemary\u0027s Baby in 1968. This reactionary genre attempted to respond to modernizing\u2014or postmodernizing, as Jordan Peterson might say\u2014changes in Church doctrine.Bottom line? The Satanic Panic largely begins in and is sustained by Catholic-flavoured conspirituality anxiety about secularization, sex, babies, and abortion.Show NotesMichael Hobbes and Sarah Marshall cover Michelle Remembers with great skill. \u002220/20\u0022 the Devil Worshippers - May 16, 1985West of Memphis movie review \u0026 film summary (2012) | Roger EbertMel Gibson: The man without a pope - Where Peter IsThe Smoke of Satan on the Silver Screen: The Catholic Horror Film, Vatican II, and the Revival of Demonology | Journal for the Academic Study of Religion -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "Life is scary. Natural disasters, violent intruders, and deadly viruses threaten our survival and endanger our loved ones. When ordinary solutions and institutions are not trusted, we may reach for talismanic help; crystals, herbal remedies, ritual prayer and magical thinking, or we might consult the charismatic oracle who channels prophecies from the Great Beyond\u2014right on your iPhone. But what about weaponry? Even though guns exert devastating real-world impact, our guest argues that they also carry an important\u00A0 symbolic power. While most may never use it, the knowledge that cold hard steel is nearby is one attempt at managing an anxiety that is all-too human. In fact, coping strategies both magical and militaristic are woven into the American political psyche\u2014and as the pandemic has demonstrated, flare up dramatically during social crises; even at times becoming strange bedfellows. Philosophy and religion professor Alan Levinovitz calls this \u0022empowerment epistemology\u0022 and describes it as a connective tissue between the seemingly distant domains of gun culture and the wellness sphere. In both cases, this longing for empowerment in the face of helplessness motivates us to cleave to what we believe protects us, regardless of evidence to the contrary\u2014or the tragic consequences in our middle schools and medical ICUs.

      "description": "Some of the most valuable material that comes to us from Paula Marino\u0027s Open Shadow film of 2017 is an extended interview with Swan\u0027s parent\u0027s, the Bosworths. They speak about Swan\u0027s sensory sensitivity as a young child, and how that morphed into a staunchly independent but sometimes isolated social life. They describe Swan\u0027s secret runic writing, their belief in her capacities as a medical intuitive, and discuss the gaps in psychiatric care that failed them all when her mental health needed help. This episode examines this interview, and then cross-checks some aspects against the account of Swan\u0027s childhood friend, Diana Hansen Ribera.Here we have the unique insight into parents speaking vulnerably and transparently about their baffling child\u2014which means we can really lean into the primal material that pre-exists the charged questions about whether Teal Swan is\u00A0 running a cult or encouraging suicide. What we find, between the accounts of the Bosworths and Ribera, is a collection of commonplace phenomena: high sensitivity, parents learning as they go, the intrusion of internet pornography, and a likely abusive figure who was too close to the family. In this episode, Matthew and Julian discuss the mystery of familial memory,\u00A0 idealizing vs. pathologizing children, the appeals of fantasy as a mode of relief, whether the Satanic Panic was a collective cry for help to resolve commonplace domestic and community abuse, and the possibility that cult formation is a social form of post traumatic play.

Derek began his career as a religion journalist, and this week he interviews Sam Kestenbaum, who\u2019s made a career in this field. Sam has written for the NY Times and the Washington Post, where he recently published an expose on Christiane Northrup.

      "description": "In this episode of the Swan Song Series, Matthew interviews Paola Marino about why she found Teal Swan a fascinating subject to film for 2018\u2019s \u201COpen Shadow.\u201D They discuss aesthetics, the mystery of personality, why Swan\u2019s parents agreed to sit down with her. Matthew also surprised her with the newly-revealed translations of Swan\u2019s coded journal pages.Prefacing the interview is a discussion between Julian and Matthew about art, artifice, the risks of doing and not doing hard journalism on the subjects we cover. They discuss James Joyce\u2019s proverb about\u00A0 noble art, in which he describes \u201Caesthetic arrest\u201D as the middle way between propaganda and pornography. Marino\u2019s work attempts to find that path, while Jon Kasbe\u2019s The Deep End falters to both sides. On one hand Kasbe\u2019s film titillates viewers with high drama. On the other hand it tells viewers what they should think. And in both cases it creates a story where the truth would suffice. The feelings excited by improper art are kinetic, desire or loathing. Desire urges us to possess, to go to something; loathing urges us to abandon, to go from something. These are kinetic emotions. The arts which excite them, pornographical or didactic, are therefore improper arts. The esthetic emotion (I use the general term) is therefore static. The mind is arrested and raised above desire and loathing. \u2014 James Joyce, Portrait of the Artist as a Young ManShow NotesOpen Shadow\u2014Paola MarinoGizmodo Launches \u0027The Gateway,\u0027 an Investigative Podcast About a Controversial Internet Spiritual Guru -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "Our guest today, Jennings Brown, is a bright light in an increasingly chaotic cult-content economy. His 2018 podcast on Teal Swan, The Gateway, produced with Gizmodo, sets a high-watermark standard for research, fairness, and sensitivity. A lot has happened since that pod dropped: #MeToo, MAGA, QAnon, COVID, and now a post-reality Supreme Court in which Justice Thomas publishes a concurrence in which he states that COVID vaccines use the tissues of aborted fetuses. All of which is to say: we don\u2019t know how intensely the insanity of the era will escalate, but we do know that clear, ethical reporting on difficult issues is a very thin lifeline back to sanity, communication, and trying to do something.If you listened to episode 109 (if you haven\u2019t we encourage you to stop here and go there), you\u2019ll hear our criticisms of The Deep End docuseries about Teal Swan. You\u2019ll hear us interview the director, Jon Kasbe. We lean on him, maybe too gently, on the numerous integrity issues with his film. Bottom line: with deceptive edits and a vacuum of expert commentary and research, we feel that this project is a real setback for everyone trying to understand cultic dynamics in the online age. And as we\u2019ll report at the top of the show, before our interview with Brown, the story of this embedment is only getting messier.Our interview with Jennings steers clear of the muck, because what we really wanted to hear was all about his process, his editorial decisions, and the help he got from his producers. We were also very lucky to have him drop some previously unreported data into the mix. Spoiler alert: it\u2019s about the types of things that Swan used to write in her secret runic alien language.Show NotesJennings Brown \u2014 About page with tip line contact infoEpisode 109: Who\u0027s Afraid of Teal Swan? w/ Jon KasbeJon Kasbe wishing Teal Swan happy birthdayBits Sola rapping Teal Swan happy birthdayGizmodo Launches \u0027The Gateway,\u0027 an Investigative Podcast About a Controversial Internet Spiritual GuruOpen Shadow \u2014 Paola MarinoPaola Marino on The Deep End (clip)Jennings Brown \u2014 Revelations -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

The unholy American trinity of conservative politics, religious extremism, and gun culture is deep into its liturgical calendar. And it looks like conspiritualist influencers in the yoga and wellness space are setting up their juice bars outside the temple of the gun. Is Christiane Northrup LARPing when she talks about murdering political enemies? What would Mikki Willis wear to tactical boot camp? Amidst the carnage of Uvalde and the Supreme Court, are conspiritualists gearing up to offer logistical or merely symbolic support for political violence? Does it even make a difference? When does the Temple of the Gun become a firing range, and then a staging ground? We\u2019ll cover these questions this week in part one of our look at guns and spirituality. Then in three weeks, Julian will talk to sociologist of religion Alan Levinovitz about how New Age spirituality and US gun culture shake hands through an \u201Cepistemology of individual empowerment,\u201D which, he argues, has emerged amidst a crash in social solidarity.Show NotesNew York Times report on Guns in GOP AdsHow Many Lives Were Saved by The Assault Weapons Ban?Christian Nationalists and the Holy Gun CrusadeRod Of Iron Ministries Buys \u201CSpiritual Retreat\u201D Property in Tennessee -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "If the world has become too much to bear\u2014and the bots know it from your search history\u2014 you will likely find Teal Swan. She will appear, an angel of the algorithms, part icon and part anime avenger. Against a backdrop of flowing water or turning constellations, she will gaze into your despair. She will speak in a drone at once hypnotic and relieving, giving words to feelings you thought were taboo. At 3am, this might feel like mystical luck, but it\u2019s no accident. Swan is open about recruiting suicidal seekers to her content, and she has the tech chops to do it.Now, with Jon Kasbe\u2019s series, \u201CThe Deep End\u201D airing on Hulu, Swan has entered some A-list limelight. But what do we really learn from this docutainment event, radiating out from an embedment in Swan\u2019s inner circle? According to Kasbe\u2019s own words, we don\u2019t learn the \u201CCapital T Truth\u201D of Swan\u2019s day-to-day, but rather the immersive feeling of what it is like to be under her spell. Or do we? Swan accuses Kasbe of casting his own spell, with deceptive editing that scrambles timelines and conflates interactions, and even different people. And it appears she might not be wrong. We talk to Kasbe in this episode about his vision and blindspots, and the ironic risk of creating a film of Satanic-Panic level false memories about an influencer who says she specializes in retrieving past trauma. This episode will pilot a series of Patreon bonus episodes in which we\u2019ll study the Teal Swan spectacle in detail, and how important it is to not only report on it well, but to be fair to an influencer like Swan and her dedicated followers, lest they lose even more trust in the real\u00A0 world.CORRECTION: Matthew referred to Jennings Brown\u0027s role on The Deep End production incorrectly during the episode.

Hundreds of videos in a series called \u201CThe Great Awakening.\u201D Christiane Northrup, the matriarch of New Age women\u2019s wellness, warns her followers about fake viruses, and tells them to avoid sex with their vaccinated partners. She stumps alongside QAnon celebrities, shovels campaign contributions to Trump, and dotes over sovereign citizen sheriffs. To ease your symptoms of ascension, she offers bath recipes of alfalfa greens and Dr. Bronner\u2019s soap. You can have a good soak and listen to her golden harp. But in this nowhere world, where oh where is Christiane Northrup? Who is she? Is she flesh and blood, or a social media hologram generated by a Louise Hay AI? Is that mansion she broadcasts from a sound stage, or is there real soil and manure and flowers there? Our guests today know Northrup as super-real, because they live in her home state of Maine. Alyce Ornella, Andy O\u2019Brien, and Mooncat have known her as a doctor, an MLM diva, antivax rabble rouser, and QAnon tour promoter. Now, they tell us, another Northrup may be crystallizing on Maine\u2019s rocky shore, floating past the lighthouses and over the cranberry bogs on a cloud of essential oils. She\u2019s been seen haunting the blueberry patches, wearing a chunky necklace of lobster claws. As Northrup begins to hold revival meetings in Down East churches, and openly fantasize about murdering political enemies, they wonder if she is assuming her ultimate form\u2014as an IRL cult leader.Show NotesDear Dr. Northrup Dr. No: Christiane NorthrupRepublican barred from inviting guests into State HouseNaomi Wolf: \u201CFive Freedoms\u201D speech, April 2021.Arise USA rally draws crowds inside, outside Crosby Center Arise USA Meets Maine Stands UpInside the Disastrous Conspiracy Roadshow That Likely Killed a COVID-Denying Ex-CIA AgentMaine Republican compared the governor to Nazi Josef MengeleME state rep compares COVID vaccine mandate to NazismNorthrup bo -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

The conversation touches on the mythological and social dimensions of religion, as well as both Julian and Matthew\u2019s experience of corporal punishment at school, meted out by the same authority figures who donned ceremonial robes for church. -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

He\u2019s come out and said so, in a bold but vague response to criticism of his content from our podcast. Matthew takes him at his word, and puts on his cult research hat to give some pointers on how Aubrey can avoid abusing his power. Key bits of advice include: rejecting high intensity recruitment techniques, not depicting the world outside Fit For Service as \u201Cupside down\u201D or insane, and not platforming alleged child molesters like Marc Gafni.While this open letter is addressed to Aubrey, his Fit For Service clients might also find it useful as they decide whether to keep spending up to 20K USD per year participating in the program. Also, if Aubrey feels that this episode contains information that will help current and future participants assess whether he is really making good on his promise to provide \u201Cradical self-sovereignty,\u201D we at Conspirituality Podcast would happily give permission for this episode to be included with Fit For Service materials, pro bono.This letter is also open in a broader sense, because it contains solid tips for all earnest charismatic influencers who want to improve their ethics game.

      "description": "Cortney and Shana can\u2019t remember exactly how they first became aware of the New Age promises and anxieties that would come to dominate every aspect of their lives. Their mom brought it into the house and their daily rhythms bit by bit.As kids in the early 1980s, they would fall asleep to visualizations by the self-help guru Wayne Dyer, on audiocassette. Or mom would read passages from Autobiography of a Yogi, by Paramahansa Yogananda, after tucking them into bed. Cortney remembers an eerie photograph of the yogi\u2019s corpse in a glass coffin in the mortuary. The lore was that he just wouldn\u2019t decay. \u201CMom had a real fascination with beating death,\u201D she told us.\u00A0When the girls were still in elementary school, mom took them to an \u201Cattunement\u201D, which must have made them the youngest Reiki Masters in Green Bay, Wisconsin\u2014if not the whole midwest. \u201CShe was on a search,\u201D Shana told us.\u00A0And at some point the local massage training, the flyers in the health food stores, and the mail-order books weren\u2019t enough. Mom started going to events, a long way from home\u2014all the way out in Washington State. One time she came home with a VHS tape and played it for the girls. It showed a woman named J.Z. Knight transform into someone she called \u201CRamtha,\u201D who she said was 35,000 years old, and carried the wisdom of the ages. She also brought audiocassettes of Ramtha, which they played in the car.\u00A0This was their introduction to \u201Cchanneling.\u201D They were young teens, and didn\u2019t know what to think. Was it magic? Was it funny? Ramtha sounded like the Great Gazoo, after all. When mom wasn\u2019t home they\u2019d show the VHS tape to their friends and giggle. But they also felt strange about it. Embarrassed.\u00A0\u201CI remember yelling at my mom, \u2018Why can\u0027t you be normal?\u2019\u201D Shana said. What they understand now is how much she desperately needed to find something that was meaningful.\u00A0\u201CShe was really struggling in the Catholic religion,\u201D Shana said, \u201CAnd her marriage,\u201D Cortney added. \u201CAnd midlife. It was the perfect storm.\u201D\u00A0Matthew sits down with Cortney and Shana as they share their story publicly for the first time.\u00A0 -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

Still fully convinced she was going to heal herself by sheer force of wishful thinking.\u201D We reached out, and Gavin agreed to an interview.Fey was 47 years old when she died under the coconut palms and stars of Ubud, with Gavin at her side. She\u2019d spent six years feverishly trying to keep ahead of breast cancer with alternative medicine and New Age spirituality. She received several turns of evidence-based care that had served her body well. But she would always return to the energy work, herbs, and meditations that spoke to her soul. Gavin was there with her all the way. He found himself stretched thin between advocating for treatments that worked, and honoring her need for magic.

Part of its argument is that we have to imagine a society in which everyone is entitled to the survival we can share.How disquieting it is that the natural instinct we have as individuals to ask:\u00A0 \u0022What is this going to cost me?\u0022 is microcosmic to neoliberal obsessions\u2014austerity, productivity, and dreams of a better future purchased with moral sacrifices in the present. It\u2019s microcosmic to the brutal decisions our societies are now making about who is worthy of protection and who isn\u0027t, and which political constituencies we can\u0027t afford to piss off by appealing to the small amount of generosity and humility it takes to wear a mask. We\u0027re living in a culture of What is it going to cost me? And that\u0027s not really a culture at all.If we don\u0027t do better, then how exactly are the conspiritualists wrong? Not about the details, but about the existential condition. They imagine a Cabal at the top of everything, making nefarious decisions, and this is easy to dismiss. Less easy to dismiss is the feeling they articulate, that many of us share: that unseen and impersonal forces are working against the spirit of human generosity. They know that sometimes we all feel ourselves participating in that process, which means we have to do something\u2014perhaps as radical as waking up. Not to the magic of turmeric, or the realization that we\u2019re starseeds. Something far more radical than that, and much more mundane: that we can organize ourselves in more fair and loving ways.Beatrice Adler-Bolton is a blind/low vision and chronically ill artist, writer, and disability justice advocate. Beatrice studies radical patient groups and the capitalist political economy of health as an independent researcher and is earning a master\u0027s in Disability Studies at CUNY. She is the co-host of the Death Panel podcast with Artie Vierkant and Phil Rocco.Note from Beatrice: If you\u0027d like to give your listeners a little more info on Disability Justice (DJ), I would recommend this link from Sins Invalid, which is a short and foundational DJ text and a really quick primer on what it is written by Patty Berne and Sins Invalid: tinyurl.com/DJ10Principles. -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "In July 2020, just as we were finding our sea legs with this podcast, Imran Ahmed joined to discuss the state of disinformation occurring around the world. As the founder of the UK\u2019s Center for Countering Digital Hate, he had just produced a report that found anti-vax organizations were reaching 58 million people on social media\u2014and this was well before the COVID vaccines were developed. The total amount of money spent by anti-vax groups and advertisers targeting their followers on Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube turned out to be roughly $1 billion.Imran\u2019s group kept reporting and we kept covering them. You probably remember the Center thanks to its Disinformation Dozen report, which profoundly impacted awareness of just how much anti-vax leaders were monetizing their supplements, seminars, and other supposed COVID \u201Cinterventions.\u201D The report even reached the White House where Joe Biden called out the Disinformation Dozen during a press conference.\u00A0What\u2019s changed in the nearly two years since we had Imran on? Well, a lot\u2014and in some ways, not much at all. Julian interviews Imran this time around after having met up in person at the Defeat the Mandates rally in downtown Los Angeles. Imran discusses what\u2019s changed, what hasn\u2019t, and how the bottom line remains the same: namely, the conspiritualist\u2019s bottom line. They also talk about the nature of free speech in an internet filled with disinformation.\u00A0Before hearing from Imran, Derek and Julian briefly discuss the state of disinformation and free speech online, which Derek frames in terms of urban planning and the concept of legibility.\u00A0 -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

Legions of Twitter counselors and Instagram therapists has risen up to offer unsolicited sermons on cults, cult leaders, and cult recovery. With COVID closing down the studios, every third yoga teacher has become an expert in trauma. They\u2019re starting Facebook groups. They\u2019re selling courses. They\u2019re doing their Family Systems work out in the open, displaying heroic levels of vulnerability. We\u2019re just waiting for the first QAnon recovery MLM to launch on Kickstarter.\u00A0 We know it\u2019s coming. There will be oils, and breathing exercises, and some very long emotional check-ins on Zoom.Meanwhile, Netflix is distinguishing itself from GaiaTV, the Netflix of cults, with an explosion of cult documentaries. There\u2019s a gold rush on. Scouts for all of the streaming companies are lined up outside of the ashrams, vetting survivors to see who has the chops to carry a series. We seem to love them, but sometimes not as much as the sociopaths themselves. The cult doc is the new true crime chill.Beneath the feeding frenzy, there\u2019s real work to be done. The QAnon Casualities subreddit has 235K followers as of today. We get dozens of emails and DMs from people who have had their lives upended by conspirituality and cults.

      "description": "If you get treated by someone who says they\u2019re a doctor, but they\u2019re not, can they still have a placebo effect? That\u2019s the question we\u2019d like to ask Dr. Joe Dispenza, who\u2019s not a doctor, but who plays one on the internet, treating one and all with the placebo of his bafflegab about Quantum healing and TimeSpace.Placebo Joe. Who is he? How do you take the measure of a Quantum Man? We\u2019ll shine our browsers into the slit experiment and observe a particle here, a wave there. The particles of video clips, the waves of affiliate links. We\u2019ll run our signature experiment: Schrodinger\u2019s Influencer, to find out just how many parallel Joe Dispenzas are populating the multiple universes he is trying to crack back to alignment with his chiropractic panache. There\u2019s the Joe of the Ramtha School of Enlightenment, Joe who starred in \u201CWhat The Bleep Do We Know?\u201D There\u2019s faith healer Joe, and Joe who now headlines, alongside David Icke, for the Netflix of conspirituality, Gaia TV.Joking aside: in episode 89, we heard from Mary, whose husband almost gave up on chemotherapy for aggressive pancreatic cancer under the influence of Placebo Joe. And today we\u2019ll watch him pretend to be able to cure infertility, and romance Aubrey Marcus. We\u2019ll also puzzle over his strangely undramatic origin story. We\u2019ll suss out the normalizing impact Joe has on a whole raft of bullshit. We\u2019ll wonder why this boy from a nice working class famiglia in Jersey wanted to be a doctor so badly, he was willing to talk himself into it.

As with Rogan, who he recently said he loved being compared to, Brand is amassing an increasingly large following\u2014trust us, he\u2019ll remind you of that number at the top of every episode\u2014thanks to his high-energy solo rants about the conspiracy of, well, seemingly everything. But what\u2019s Russell really saying? We\u2019ve listened to hours of his podcasts and watched further hours of videos and, to be honest, we can\u2019t really tell. Pseudo-spiritual musings mesh with benign revolutionary politicizing with a healthy dose of his live performance schedule and reminders to smash the subscribe button thrown in. Russell is exceptionally good at evoking emotions and firing listeners up with his high-energy, seemingly stream-of-consciousness diatribes, yet when you break down the sentences, you find that he\u2019s pretty content-free. Well, except when he\u2019s marketing himself, which, at the end of the day, seems to be the only thing Russell is truly interested in.Show NotesHybrid immunity offers increased protection that is longer-lasting against Covid-19 reinfection, studies showRussell Brand: My ResponseRussell Brand: How Did We Miss This?Russell Brand \u0026 Nigel Farage clash over immigration on Question TimeRussell Brand: \u0027I\u0027ve never voted, never will\u0027Johnson \u0026 Johnson Announces Real-World Evidence and Phase 3 Data Confirming Strong and Long-Lasting Protection of Single-Shot COVID-19 Vaccine in the U.S.Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Vaccine Boosting in Persons Already Protected by Natural or Vaccine-Induced ImmunityEffectiveness of the BNT162b2 Vaccine after Recovery from Covid-19Protection against SARS-CoV-2 after Covid-19 Vaccination and Previous InfectionWorld Economic Forum: Digital IdentityWatch Russell Brand Read From A Couple Of My Articles -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

Initially floated in the 19th century, terrain theory was never\u00A0 proven in real-world experiments, and so fell dormant\u2014until now. As with many terrible 19th-century science metaphysics, conspiritualists are feeling nostalgic. And do we have a group to introduce you to this week.To help us debunk this funk, Dr Dan Wilson returns to the pod to offer his keen ear in breaking down the bullsh*t being shoveled by Tom Cowan and Andrew Kaufman during The Event 2021.

It turns out that once you\u0027re all-in on the cabal, the Great Reset, mole children, and vaccine genocide, whatever happens in the world means you were right all along. Conspiritualists are claiming that, just like Donald Trump, Putin is really a light worker fighting to save the children and destroy Anthony Fauci\u0027s secret bioweapons labs in Ukraine while heralding the true Great Awakening. But an entirely different prophecy, one promising a Soviet spiritual rebirth, appears to be inspiring Vladimir Putin\u0027s actions\u2014as well as Russia\u0027s disruptive interference in American politics. Julian unpacks the perennialist religious movement, Traditionalism, and how it speaks to fascist political actors around the world, including Steve Bannon. This is especially relevant in light of tragic events in Europe, a stark reminder of those of us who remember the Cold War. This time, Dugin and Putin dream of a new Russian Empire.Show NotesAleksandr Dugin Ukraine Invasion Press ConferenceMoscow Patriarch Stokes Religious Tensions with Ukraine RemarksDugin, Putin \u0026 The 2016 ElectionThe Rise of Traditionalism by Benjamin TeitelbaumSteve Bannon\u2019s Ideological SoulmateDugin Fired from University Post for Inciting GenocideThe London Dinner that Brought Europe\u2019s Far-Right TogetherBannon Cites Julius EvolaInside The Strange Origins of Bannon\u2019s Nationalist FantasiaDugin\u2019s Foundations of Geopolitics ReviewedDugin\u2019s Eurasianism \u0026 The Am -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "A few weeks ago, you couldn\u2019t turn to a social media platform without seeing that Joe Rogan was trending. The diversity of topics boggled the mind: COVID disinformation; misogyny, pseudoscience; transphobia; and, of course, racism, thanks to the infamous N-word mixtape. Then a parallel argument came through: fair pay for musicians on Spotify. Given that Rogan was given $100 million for his podcasting contract\u2014a number we\u2019d later find out was closer to $200 million\u2014the economic discussion brought another dimension into the conversation. But given all of the topics being discussed, which dimension should we have focused on?That thought led Derek to write a series of tweets on the topic, followed by a more in-depth Substack article contemplating the three main issues of concern: scientific misinformation, racism, and fair pay. The tweets led to a lot of pushback, which we\u2019ll be looking at through the lens of conversation and debate, as well as a 2021 Pew Research poll on American political typologies. It also led to today\u2019s guests\u2014infectious disease epidemiologist and science communicator, Jessica Malaty Rivera, and civic product leader and community activist, Daniel Latorre\u2014offering their own views on the topics, first on social media, then here on the podcast. But first, we\u2019ll discuss the implications of intersectionality and progressive politics in a world in which social media can distort as much as it amplifies. Matthew will dish on how much he loathes everything Joe Rogan stands for, and why\u2014but also wonders about how pragmatic his seething hatred is, or could be.Just a note before we begin. Between our last episode\u2014in which Julian caught up with Sara Aniano and dappergander on current events in the QAnon world\u2014and today, Russia has invaded Ukraine, and all of the news is terrible and terrifying. Since the first rockets hit, we\u2019ve been monitoring how conspirituality influencers are responding, and we\u2019ll bring you that data next week, as it continues to show the adaptability of the movement and the willingness of its influencers to say literally anything to remain at the center of the attention and outrage economy.Show NotesJoe Rogan: We are in Kali YugaJoe Rogan shares Sadhguru: \u201CIt is fashionable to suffer\u201DMatthew Sheffield on Right-Left \u201Cbalance\u201D on Rogan.McInnes appearance on Rogan \u201Cinstrumental\u201D to Proud Boys\u2019 growth: Rolling StoneBeyond Red vs. Blue: The Political TypologyRace \u0026 Class at Spotify -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

Sibbio has since developed this role with gusto, becoming a minor celebrity in the Canadian antivax movement. Recently, she threw her support behind the Occupation of Ottawa.But everyone comes from somewhere: a family, a network, a circle. Beneath a persona hardened by the social media spectacle, there\u2019s a person to be known, remembered, and perhaps welcomed back. Today Matthew sits down with four friends who have known and loved Stephanie since junior high school. They share stories of the bonds they nurtured growing up, and how quickly and violently antivax ideology and social media smashed their circle. An honest and transparent discussion about the emotional and social costs of conspirituality. Show NotesGlowing Mama Anti-Masker.

It shows a little boy, clearly stressed, sitting in the cab of an expensive black pickup truck with the window open, holding his ears against the incredible noise of the air horns as his mother takes a triumphant pan-shot video of a convoy rally.  The clip encapsulates the surreal chaos of a deceptive, astroturfed, funded-from-outside, social-media-driven catastrophe that is right in line with the worst of the conspirituality world. A torrent of misinformation, co-opted trauma, and \u201Cfreedom-fighters\u201D LARPing, in which children are weaponized by super-pilled parents, in which we can witness the cycles of social neglect and psychic violence turning in real time.  We open today with a review of the Occupation of Ottawa and what we know so far, and a discussion of how our conspirituality friends are co-opting and distorting events in ways that are not only craven, but will increase the chances that this event will end in violence.

      "description": "Mary joins Matthew for an extended interview about the last year of her husband\u2019s life. Louis died of pancreatic cancer almost exactly a year ago, at the age of 45. Mary\u2014who has asked that her last name be kept off the record for privacy concerns\u2014loved him and cared for him throughout that journey. It was hard, not only for the reasons we all share, but because Louis spent his last months under the influence of quantum chiropractor Joe Dispenza. At one crucial point, he was on the verge of stopping his chemotherapy treatment, believing that a Dispenza meditation technique might be more effective. Mary is an Applied Psychologist with a science background and an evidence-based mindset. She didn\u2019t share Louis\u2019s beliefs or ideals, and at points was terrified that his death would be hastened by conspirituality. But of course, she loved and served him nonetheless. And it seems he had a good death, perhaps blessed by beliefs that made Mary wonder if they might provide relief for her as well. If we\u2019ve learned one thing over the course of this project, it\u2019s that we\u2019ll be living and dying together for a long time at the crossroads of data and imagination, science and spirituality, evidence and the unknown. We\u2019re grateful that Mary has shared this love story of how she navigated it all.

While it\u2019s debatable how much good chiropractic adjustments are doing for your body\u2014there\u2019s some evidence that it alleviates lower back pain, alongside a litany of unsubstantiated claims\u2014what\u2019s not debatable is the number of anti-vax, pseudoscience-prone chiropractors clogging the conspirituality pipeline these days.This isn\u2019t a \u201Cchiropractor takedown\u201D episode, as both Derek and Julian have benefited from treatments in the past. Indeed, there\u2019s a whole realm of \u201Cmixers\u201D that try to follow best practices and clinical science. Yet there\u2019s a strong conspiritualist lean among a number of chiropractors and we want to know why. To that end, Derek offers a history of the practice, which is, perhaps unsurprisingly, rooted in an anti-vax, anti-medicine strain of 19th-century vitalism. Julian discusses some of his experiences while Matthew questions consent and harm in the industry. The team then breaks down chiropractor Melissa Sell\u2019s discussion of the antisemitic Germanic New Medicine, which she recently championed on the pseudopalooza of online disinformation conferences, The Event 2021.

      "description": "Inspired by a recent discussion on psychoanalysis and politics with Pat Blanchfield on Know Your Enemy, this brief meditation focuses on two aspects of the conspirituality landscape that have lurked in the unconscious of the pod:  People do not make sense. There are conflicting impulses and voices within us all. One objective of our project is akin to the goal psychoanalysis: to get those parts talking.\u00A0  Calling people hypocrites for not making sense is a terrible way of getting them to make sense. What we call hypocrisy, they have used for coherence and survival. The blowback isn\u0027t stubbornness, but a confession of needs.  Matthew looks at how the contradictions of Kelly Brogan and JP Sears make sense. Brogan rails against \u0022mommy medicine\u0022 while installing herself as \u0022mommy shaman.\u0022 Sears tells us \u0022Don\u0027t outsource your truth,\u0022 while he absorbs data from Bitchute and Rogan. Brogan\u0027s followers are attracted by the simultaneous rejection and reconstitution of authority. JP Sears is a hollow husk of a man, telling his followers to look inside. But when you meet a contradiction or a defence that is harmful, you can\u2019t just argue it away. You have to work towards a better answer to the condition the defence is trying to ease.Show NotesFreud and Politics (w/ Pat Blanchfield) -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "When we left our Austin conspirituality heroes in the last episode, Charles Eisenstein, New Age Q, was locking in his position as the philosopher\u2014or jester\u2014in the court of Aubrey Marcus. But what of this court? Matthew\u2019s scene by scene analysis of some prime Marcus marketing porn will give us some clues. The video in question is for Marcus\u2019s life-coaching programme, which is called \u201CFit for Service.\u201D The visuals centre around what looks like a haka ritual dance, through which customers release their inner warriors, nurture their affiliate links and jazz up their socials. On point for the influencer age, the ritual plays out in a narcissistic hall of mirrors, choreographed for performance by programme participants in order to promote the programme they are performing in. Naturally, Matthew will be using the analytical frameworks of spectacle and simulation from Guy Debord and Jean Baudrillard to make sense of it. He\u2019ll also apply Renato Rosaldo\u2019s concept of \u201Cimperialist nostalgia\u201D to explore the ugly conflicts in Marcus\u2019s indigenous cosplay.Show NotesFit for Service homepagefit.for.service:\u00A0 A Dandelion In A Field Is Un-killableA poet\u2019s plea to save our planet | IN-Q | TED Institute \u0022Revolution\u0022: The FORGOTTEN Voices of The Pandemic Will Have You In TearsThe 5 Desires: Marcus on FFS promises Aubrey Marcus - Fit For Service Mastermind - Review \u2013 Max HugThe Wellness Pornographers.

      "description": "Up to this point, we\u2019ve understood Charles Eisenstein as the poet-philosopher of conspirituality, lending his Burning Man ritual workshop chops to the antivax faux-freedom movement. Out of deference to his apparent sensitivity and respectable writing skills, we\u2019ve given him the benefit of the doubt\u2014we even invited him on this show for two episodes to see whether we could find common ground. We didn\u2019t.In our last Bonus episode, Julian tracked how Eisenstein has accelerated and intensified his rhetoric. Today, we\u2019ll see how he\u2019s fortifying his money networks, and starting to say the quiet parts out loud. He\u2019s no longer \u201Cjust\u201D dog-whistling violence and QAnon. We\u2019re reviewing a recent video he\u2019s co-produced with Onnit multimillionaire and Austin bro-poet Aubrey Marcus. It\u2019s an anime rendition of the ending of his 2013 bestseller, The More Beautiful World Our Hearts Know is Possible. In the book, Eisenstein presents \u201CThe Gathering of the Tribe\u201D as a kind of personal mythology. As he levels up to the big leagues, this story about belonging to a group of blessed alien shamans sent to wake up humanity carries clear real-world literalness\u2014and a culty vibe. If the high-end video doesn\u2019t convince you, a tape from a hipster New Year\u2019s Eve party in Ithaca NY might do the trick. As he holds guru-court for All the Big Questions, Eisenstein tells an Iraq vet that he has special gifts to deploy against the (fictional) building of COVID concentration camps in Rhode Island. Then he says he hopes the \u201Cpedophile elite\u201D will just stop. Sound familiar?Eisenstein\u2019s content is poetic and vague. Its implications are plausibly deniable. It pours out through an endless stream of radiant and inscrutable essay drops. He has mastered the cryptic prompt that either speaks to your soul, to your appetite for disrupting public health, or to your recent tactical training regimen. Who can really tell? His skill is to stand beside and above it all. He can avoid being pinned down. It\u2019s almost as if he\u2019s not really there, but only reflecting the zeitgeist of our broken moment. It\u2019s time to just name him for what he is: New Age Q.Show NotesA Gathering of the Tribe | POWERFUL Short Film by Charles Eisenstein w/ Jon Hopkins \u0026 Aubrey MarcusA Gathering of the Tribe | Reality Sandwich (original, 2009)A Gathering of the Tribe (full version Charles\u2019s site)Interview with Charles Eisenstein | Inner World Press | Shift in Consciousness Ezine In the Miracle (Eisenstein essay, 2009)Charles Eisenstein at Resonance NYE The Man Behind th -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

Yoga International\u2014one of the largest yoga media companies in the world\u2014had been acquired by Gaia\u2014one of the largest pseudoscience, pseudointellectual, conspiracy theory platforms in the world. While the CEO of Yoga International immediately assured nervous content providers that the platform will remain editorially independent, only time will tell.

He was a cult leader rapist who thought yoga would help the world understand messages sent by UFOs. Not exactly confidence-inspiring.Not every YTT programme is bad\u2014today\u0027s bonus host Matthew has worked in some good ones for over a decade. But on the whole, we\u0027re talking about an industry that has graduated up to 500K ppl over 50 years through a pseudo-educational process that has greased the epistemological pipeline towards conspirituality.YTTs are unregulated by any academic or professional consensus. They are driven by the anxious charisma of urban yoga studio entrepreneurs who need to sell big-ticket products to counter the rising overheads of the gentrification they\u0027re helping to drive. Their curricula offers a pastiche of uncited resources. They pad contact hours with sermons and meditation sessions.\u00A0The typical YTT training manual is an unironic postmodern meat-grinder in which Iron Age philosophy and high school anatomy are blended with quotes from Carl Jung and Rumi. As an example, Matthew looks at a Jivamukti Yoga School manual from a 2007 training hosted at Omega Institute.Again: not all YTTs are bad, or lead to QAnon. But the ritual and charismatic pedagogy that most offer has a lot in common with the sacrament of redpilling\u2014albeit more socially acceptable and aspirational.\u00A0Conspirituality went viral in 2020. It\u0027s time to ask whether the YTT industry compromised a culture\u0027s immunity to it. Show NotesHello, YogAnon!

In the face of endless and relentless odds and near-constant demoralization, what stories do we turn to, what bonds do we form, and who do they help?Climate journalist emeritus George Monbiot joins Matthew to discuss the never-ending road of empathy and activism, and what happens on that road when otherwise brilliant and sensitive people \u201Close their mirror,\u201D or sense of responsibility to the commons. What happens when they aestheticize grief. What happens when they have enough privilege to fetishize renunciation. Their discussion orbits around the recent conspirituality spiral of a writer who has been\u00A0 a hero to many in the realm of climate literature and consideration. Paul Kingsnorth has recently converted to Romanian Orthodox Christianity... and vaccine skepticism. He\u0027s also wondered aloud whether the virus is not \u0022a delicious little sign from God\u0022 that humanity deserves punishment.

      "description": "While Americans were transforming esoteric strains of yoga into a commodifiable industry in 1980, a young naval officer named Steve Bannon was picking up theosophical texts in metaphysical bookstores and practicing Zen meditation in secret while stationed in Hong Kong. He was wary of his countrymates liberal explorations of Eastern philosophies, aware of the nationalistic roots upon which these \u201Cmystical\u201D systems were founded. Then he stumbled into Traditionalism, a perennial philosophy that consumed all world religions, as popularized by the likes of French metaphysicist Ren\u00E9 Gu\u00E9non and Italian antisemitic conspiracy theorist Julius Evola.This week we welcome Benjamin Teitelbaum, an Assistant Professor of Ethnomusicology and International Affairs at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and author of the book, War for Eternity: The Return of Traditionalism and the Rise of the Populist Right. Teitelbaum gained access to leading right-wing figures around the world, including Steve Bannon. He\u2019s got their number and brings receipts.

On September 17, just 14 short months later, Flynn took the stage, bathed in light at the Lord of Hosts Church in Omaha, Nebraska to lead a political prayer that was a fiery angelic call-to-arms. But, oops! It turns out that this prayer traces back to New Age doomsday cult leader, Elizabeth Clare Prophet. Now the Q-faithful have turned on their hero, accusing him of being in league with the Satanic cabal.

Easily weaponized by conspiritualists, this sermon is equal parts intimate confessional, prophecy download, and motivational coaching, directly transmitted from your favorite self-anointed maverick expert. Social media seems perfectly designed for such hypnotic performances and spiritual darshans. But in the brick-and-mortar world, yoga teachers have long blurred the line between acting and teaching, space holding and theater, and ritual ceremony and fitness. If all the world\u0027s a stage, as Shakespeare had it, the wooden planks of the yoga studio\u2014and the digital platforms built in ether\u2014demand that teachers embrace a role, adopt a script, and sell a story to their audience. What we want to know is: where does the performance end and yoga begin, or perhaps more to the point, is there even a difference?Our guest host today is Jill Miller, who many listeners will know from her hugely influential body of work in yoga and movement as founder of Tune-Up Fitness. She\u0027s also a former actor, which played an important role in her transition to full-time yoga instructor.

      "description": "To prepare this curative episode, we listened carefully to alternative health consumers for many hours, taking an exhaustive history of life challenges on physical, mental, and emotional planes. We scanned the symptoms against our compendium of disease states and prescribed the precise substances that would mirror them.Then, we took minuscule audio samples from our podcasting apothecary \u2014 skepticism, melancholy, and empathy. We mixed these, diluted them a thousand times, to the point at which they became completely inaudible. Then we shook them up and down while chanting the spell of this bespoke remedy: Conspiritualitis investigarium.Please don\u2019t try to turn up your volume on this episode. You can\u2019t actually hear it, and that\u2019s what makes it so powerful. But seriously folks. Welcome to our long-awaited homeopathy show \u2014 and not a week too soon. NFL\u2019s leading quarterback Aaron Rodgers has just admitted to endangering the entire league by opting to be \u201Cimmunized\u201D via homeopathy rather than complying with the league\u2019s vaccination requirements. (He\u2019s also a lying liar.) There are reports of homeopaths selling COVID19 remedies \u2014 through both small ops in the U.S., and federally-approved dispensers in India, where Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu Nationalists mingled sugar pills with astrology to help disguise their negligent pandemic response. Derek takes us on a tour through the strange history of this medicine that isn\u2019t there, and interviews Jonathan Jarry of the McGill Office for Science and Society on why it haunts us. Julian contextualizes homeopathy against the broader \u201CComplementary and Alternative Medicine\u201D landscape. And Matthew wonders about the uses of magic.

      "description": "There is no avoiding the fact that conspirituality plays out against a backdrop of racially-charged politics and the echoes of colonialism. And from the beginning of this podcast project we\u2019ve tackled things like the origins of yoga and wellness being tangled up with European fascist movements and racist eugenics. We\u2019re speaking from and into a culture that is predominantly white, and has the disposable income to afford boutique health ideologies. We know it\u2019s naturally allergic to the project of public health. We know that it ignores the social determinants of health \u2014 because if it didn\u2019t, it couldn\u2019t sell its green-smoothie-based hero\u2019s journeys.But reporting on race and conspirituality is only going to get harder. In this episode, Matthew reviews a new volume of essays that might help. A Field Guide to White Supremacy, edited by Drs. Kathleen Belew and Ramon Gutierrez, brings together a pile of resources for journalists and policy-makers who want to engage thoughtfully with issues of equality. And he interviews Dr. Belew on best practices, The Great Replacement conspiracy theory, and why there are no \u201Clone wolves.\u201DIn a debrief discussion, Derek and Julian join in to puzzle out the complexities of reporting on Robert F. Kennedy Jr. platforming Black anti-vax activists, how the sources of vax-hesitancy shown by Aaron Rogers and Kyrie Irving might be coming from different places, and how to think empathetically about vaccine hesitancy in Black liberation movements.

But, as Matthew explores in this bonus episode: what are the contours of social comfort and habitus \u2014 supported by faith and ritual \u2014 that haunt any layperson\u0027s relationship to science? When the pressure is on, be it acute or existential, do we really display \u0022critical thinking\u0022 \u2014 or are we really skilled at post-hoc rationalizing choices that embody the social status we wish to identify with?What are the psychosocial scents that waft from institutional actors vs. influencers, and what does it say about history and personal experience that one or the other is inviting, or terrifying?Finally: both Steve Hassan and Lee McIntyre have proposed that careful 1:1 conversations can re-establish interpersonal trust with the indoctrinated. But when we\u0027re talking about making vulnerable populations less susceptible to pseudoscience and conspiracy theories, is this really sufficient? Or must we consider broader forms of social atonement, like reparations?

Toxic mimicries of therapy, mentorship, political awareness, and community.In this investigative report, Matthew digs into the background of a recent article posted to Medium called \u201COpen Letter to Elena Brower.\u201D He interviews the author, Tatum Fjerstad, who Brower mentored from 2014 to 2016, and Liz Fullen, who worked as Brower\u2019s unpaid yoga class assistant for approximately three years. He\u2019ll also play excerpts from a legally-recorded Zoom call in which Brower gives non-consensual \u201Ccoaching\u201D to a stranger.

      "description": "With a new variant of QAnon circulating through white evangelical churches, protests against masks and vaccines are becoming more aggressive around the world. In Germany, a gas station attendant who asked a customer to mask-up was shot dead this week, and a Maryland man allegedly killed his pharmacist brother and sister in law, believing that they were poisoning people with vaccines. Demonstrations have turned violent in Australia; in New York, a mobile-free Covid-test site was up-ended. In LA, Beverly Hills protest organizer Shiva Bagheri was caught on video punching a breast cancer patient outside a clinic and harassing parents and kids as they walked into an elementary school, yelling that vaccines are a form of child-rape. For this week\u2019s Bonus, Julian looks at these developments through the lens of research on radicalization and fascist political movements. While Westboro Baptist Church tip-toes right up to the edge of violence with their hateful fundamentalist activism, the anti-abortion movement has included terrorism in the form of bombing, kidnapping, and murder. But it\u2019s not all bad news. This episode ends with data from a recent study on what supports de-radicalization, as well as a hopeful personal account of how compassionate online interactions led one woman to exit a hate group she was born into, and advocate now for tolerance.

Matthew adds kitchen notes from the spiritual cult front lines. Julian talks with Chelsea Roff, founder of Eat Breathe Thrive, about her own struggles with food before discussing her decade of experience working with eating disorder victims in Yogaland.

Don\u2019t people their world with hopeless cases.Questions include:  What is a conspiracy?\u00A0  What\u2019s the difference between a good and bad conspiracy?\u00A0  So what are conspiracy theories?\u00A0  Are all conspiracy theories bad?\u00A0  How can people can believe COVID isn\u2019t real when they can see how many people are getting sick and dying?\u00A0  Why do conspiracy theorists make things worse than they actually are?\u00A0  Why would the government cover up aliens?\u00A0  What is spirituality?\u00A0  What do conspiracy theories have to do with spirituality?\u00A0  So if you grew up believing in Jesus, did you used to believe in conspirituality?   -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "Whatever one\u2019s conception of \u201CGod\u201D is, \u201CJohn of God\u201D should now be a nauseating name. For decades, Jo\u00E3o Teixeira de Faria pretended to heal an endless stream of pilgrims to his center in rural central Brazil through the Spiritist practice of \u201Cpsychic surgery.\u201D In reality, the miracle healing claims worked to cover up an obvious truth. Jo\u00E3o was sexually assaulting and raping women, in public and in private, likely every day of his \u201Cworking\u201D life. As he did so, he amassed a vast fortune in affiliate businesses, farming operations, real estate, referral rackets, and sales of crystals and fake remedies.In this episode we won\u2019t retell this history, now poignantly captured by a new Brazilian-made documentary on Netflix. Instead, we\u2019ll look at how lazy and motivated journalism shook hands with the entrepreneurial New Age to validate and accelerate the absurd claims of a monster. In addition to original reporting on how Jo\u00E3o made his mark in the U.S., Matthew is joined by former New Age publicist Lisa Braun Dubbels and Brazilian journalist Mirna Wabi Sabi to discuss the globalization of magic and abuse. Trigger warnings for this episode: rape, sexual assault, fraud, spiritual abuse.Show NotesBiles, Maroney, Raisman and Nichols opening statements before CongressChico Xavier | ObituaryIs \u2018John of God\u2019 a Healer or a Charlatan?John of God \u2014 SkepdicJames Randi ABC comments debriefThe trouble with Dr. OzJohn of God 2006 Atlanta ProgramAbout Heather CummingsOprah March 13, 2010: \u201CDo You Believe in Miracles?\u201D (webarchive)Leap of Faith: Meet John of God \u2014 Susan Casey (webarchive)Part One: John of God: Oprah\u2019s Favorite Ghost-Channeling Rapist Surgeon \u2013 Behind the BastardsFamous Brazilian spiritual healer accused of sexual abuse | 60 Minutes Australia -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "Daniel Sherrell is the author of an extraordinary memoir and prayer book, Warmth: Coming of Age at the End of Our World, in which he recounts how, as a climate activist born in 1990, he has fought to manage, digest, and even celebrate the desperate tasks of the only age he\u2019s known: the Anthropocene. The book is his homage to the resources that help him meditate on weaning ourselves from the dissociations of Twitter and doing the hard work of transforming climate grief into climate integrity.In our feature interview this week, Matthew sits down with Daniel to discuss the real conspiracy of climate denialism, and how conspiracy theories provide relief to those who cannot contemplate our condition.We start the show with Derek\u2019s contemplation of Amitav Ghosh\u2019s \u201CThe Great Derangement\u201D and Julian\u2019s notes on climate denialism dwarfing the disinformation we typically interrogate in the wellness world.Show NotesWarmth by Daniel SherrellSherrell and Dorothy Fortenberry on Know Your EnemyWhy Grief can be Strength in a Warming World | Daniel Sherrell |Learning How to Die in the Anthropocene \u2013 ScrantonLaudato si\u2019 (24 May 2015) | FrancisTucker Carlson on Military Vaccine MandateDr. Wilson (Debunk the Funk) on Mike YeadonBig Oil\u2019s War on ScienceUCSA Climate Skeptic Disinformation ListThe Climate Disinformation PlaybookDesmog DatabaseSteven Koonin, the \u201CObama Scientist\u201DDaniel Sherrell\u2019s Reading ListDucks, Newburyport \u2014 EllmanThe Summer Book \u2013 Jannson -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

Unsurprisingly, voting patterns perfectly matched the state COVID heat map, with fans of the recall suffering the worst outbreaks. Meanwhile, a strict lockdown in Australia, which is experiencing a Delta outbreak, led to American libertarians and right-wing commentators screaming fascism! We talk to Decoding the Gurus co-host (and real-life Australian) Matthew Browne about the situation on the ground. Later in the episode, Julian interviews another Aussie, Dr. Izzy Smith, about her online anti-conspiracy theory activism and science advocacy.In the Ticker, Derek looks at JP Sears\u2019s new cryptocurrency grift, which appears to be inspired by fellow Austinite Mikki Willis\u2014who also announced a supplement grift this week.

He\u2019ll tell you that he popularized Swiss Balls, and about his time working with the Jordan-era Chicago Bulls and then the championship Lakers. The kinesiologist and founder of the Chek Institute, which offers numerous training programs under the slogan, \u201CWe teach the science of living well,\u201D claims that he\u2019s always taken a holistic approach to weightlifting and the gym. In fact, the man does not mind telling you how vast his influence is.Embedded in Chek\u2019s holistic approach is a penchant for conspiratorial thinking. He trained JP Sears, traded podcasts with biohacker Ben Greenfield, hung with anus sunshiner Troy Casey, and hosted Mikki Willis twice in the last year on his own podcast, Living 4D with Paul Chek. Today\u2019s co-host, NYC-based fitness expert Antonio Valladares, also trained with Chek, but unlike many of Chek\u2019s acolytes, Antonio has used his time and knowledge debunking conspiracy theories in nutrition and fitness, not adding to the fire. In this week\u2019s closer, Matthew reviews and contextualizes a Facebook post from the charismatic dissectionist Gil Hedley. Hedley\u2019s post leaned into familiar anti-vax territory. But he deleted it \u2014 and, in a positive email exchange, revealed some earnest motivations and empathetic impulses. A good lesson that you never quite know where people are coming from, or where they\u2019re going.Show NotesDeconstructing Paul ChekWho is Paul Chek: Holistic Lifestyle CoachPlandemic Director Mikki Willis Explains His Presence at Capitol Riot \u2014 Matthew RemskiAbout Gil HedleyGil Hedley: Fascia and stretching:\u00A0 The Fuzz Speech -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

Because at every turn on this podcast, we are talking about economies built within demographics sewn together by consumerism. It\u2019s a world in which charisma is the currency and emotions are the commodities. When the influencer sells you on their subscription \u201Ccommunity\u201D, they are offering a toxic mimic of friendship \u2014 that\u2019s clear\u2026 Think of how MLMs co-opt the lingo of \u201Ccommunity\u201D, \u201Ctribe\u201D, etc, when what they\u2019re really doing is turning every single social interaction within a given demographic into a sales pitch.Show NotesAbout Lindsey \u0026 Krista: Almost 30SoulCycle changed fitness.

As journalist Will Storr points out in his new book, The Status Game: On Social Position and How We Use It, you can\u2019t escape our impulse for achieving status. You can learn to dampen its hold on you, however. Derek catches up with Will to discuss how status plays a role in anti-vax groups, spiritual communities, and political groups.We start this week with a Ticker by Matthew, who previews a bonus episode on the friendship porn we see on the Almost 30 episode in which the hosts share tears after being snowjobbed by Zach Bush.Show NotesAlmost 30 podcast, Ep.451: Dr. Zach Bush on Fear, The Immune System, \u0026 The Real Meaning of LifeThe Status Game by Will Storr review \u2014 how the fight for status defines our world -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "With guests: Philip Deslippe, Jules Hartley, Janja Lalich, and Stacie StukinWe\u2019ve convened an expert panel this week to remember and discuss Katie Griggs, aka GJ. She died in an LA hospital on the evening of August 1st. LA Magazine was the first outlet to confirm the death with the RA MA Institute, which Griggs co-founded in Venice, CA.The cause of death has not been confirmed, but according to a eulogy film put out by the RA MA Institute, Griggs reportedly broke her ankle in Berlin on July 11th, and on the 15th had surgery to repair it in Los Angeles. Subsequently, she developed a pulmonary embolism, which proved fatal.In episodes 36 and 37, Philip and Stacie joined me to discuss Griggs\u2019s adopted culture and religion, Kundalini Yoga, and where she stood in relation to the legacy of KY\u2019s abusive founder, Yogi Bhajan. They are uniquely equipped for that background: Philip is an expert in KY history, and Stacie has published excellent investigative work on the #metoo wave that swept through the community to uncover long-suppressed stories of Bhajan\u2019s abuses.Joining us today to dig even deeper are former Kundalini Yoga student Jules Hartley, and renowned cult expert Janja Lalich. In our earlier episodes, we discussed how Griggs went on the offensive in the midst of the Kundalini abuse scandal, publicly attacking Bhajan\u2019s survivors. We also discussed how she quickly pivoted into conspiracy theories about COVID and BLM when the pandemic hit. We also discussed the culture and cultural impact of Griggs\u2019s RA MA Institute.We continue that discussion in somber tones today.Show NotesPhilip Deslippe\u2019s websiteJules Hartley on IMDBJanja Lalich\u2019s website and 2021 Recommended Reading ListStacie Stukin on TwitterLA Magazine Griggs death noticeInside the Dubious World of RA MA Yoga, and Its Girl Boss Guru to the Stars \u2014 Cassidy George, VICEGuru Jagat Dies.

When Wolf Terry got trolled for daring to argue in Yoga Journal that getting vaccinated was an act of non-harming, the stormfront was clear. As thousands of yoga studios ponder opening amidst the stop-and-start waves of Delta and beyond, one question dominates staff meetings: \u201CWill we ask our returning clients for proof of vaccination?\u201D  Matthew interviews Sarah Garden and Colin Hall of Bodhi Tree Yoga in Saskatchewan, who made national news when they announced that yes, they would. Bodhi Tree clients will have to show their card; if they can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to be vaccinated, online classes are still available. Simple, right? Not in Yogaland. We\u2019ll be reading from emails describing the backlash \u2014 from the absurd to the abhorrent \u2014 faced by studio owners who are taking the no-brainer Bodhi Tree path.  In the Ticker, Derek looks at Antisemitism in vaccine disinformation campaigns while Julian checks in with Joseph Mercola, who announced he\u2019ll be removing all content from his website this week. In the Jab, Julian lays out the \u201Cbase-rate fallacy\u201D anti-vaxxers are using to falsely claim that vaccinations are not helping to stop COVID-19.

      "description": "It takes patience, empathy, and a steady hand to paint a detailed landscape of the politics and culture that connect anti-feminism to ethnonationalism to the broader obsessions of conspirituality.Dr. Annie Kelly\u2019s scholarship in these spaces reveals a network of \u201Csubversion anxieties\u201D: that patriarchy will be replaced by social justice autocrats, that the privileged will be brought low, that feminism will destroy hetero freedoms and pleasures, that human bodies will become cyborgs, that collectivism will replace capitalism. As our guest host this week, she\u2019ll be our tour guide through the last decade of hot internet garbage, and explain how she\u2019s kept her manners and wits intact enough to gain the trust of QAnon moms on the front lines of the U.K.\u2019s anti-lockdown movement. We\u2019ll also talk about her new brilliant podcast \u201CVaccine: The Human Story,\u201D which takes the history of smallpox and its eradication as an object lesson for the COVID era.On the vaccine tip, our brief Ticker will address how the yoga world showed its anti-vax ass by trolling a Yoga Journal writer who dared to argue that getting vaccinated was a practice of non-violence.Show NotesWolf Terry: Getting the COVID-19 Vaccine Was My Act of AhimsaMatthew Remski: How Yoga Journal Set Off an Anti-Vax BacklashKelly: Opinion | The Housewives of White SupremacyKelly: The alt-right: Reactionary rehabilitation for white masculinityQAA Episode 110: Mothers For QAnon w/ Annie Kelly by QAnon AnonymousKelly: Vaccine, the Human StoryAnti-Vaxxers Could Be Helping Create Deadlier Versions of Covid -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

An exploration of the deeply Freudian aspects of Goldstein\u2019s account: its frenzied death wish expressed in an oral/anal fetish of raw meat and body perfectionism. The larger psychoanalytic question is: why are these displays gratifying to his followers? What does Goldstein allow them to feel, without shame? Part of it giving absolution for reactionary behaviours that feel good: consuming huge quantities of meat, and fantasizing about being surrounded by dozen babies on a homestead. In this part we also meet Goldstein\u2019s mom.  A letter that confesses how warmly I feel towards Goldstein: towards the understandable needs that get hijacked by the politics he\u2019s gotten messed up in.

What should they do when it becomes clear that they are evangelizing while pretending to teach secular humanism? These are the sticky questions raised by Dr. Jennifer Sapio in today\u2019s interview with Matthew. Sapio taught for three years at the Austin Waldorf School. She was hired from her secular training, but gradually found herself drawn into what she calls an \u201Cinherently racist cult.\u201D Her mentors pushed her towards accepting the 19th-century babblings of Rudolf Steiner, who, among other exploits, read the \u201CAkashic Records\u201D to learn why the spirit world disapproved of vaccines.

      "description": "This episode is co-hosted by Dr. C. Thi Nguyen, a philosopher who teaches at the University of Utah. His breakthrough book is about agency in games, in which he shines a light on disquieting aspects of our gamified lives and the question of whether we\u2019re still able to act on our own values. We\u2019ll talk about Dr. Nguyen\u2019s key ideas, all of which are super useful for navigating conspirituality: the gamification of Twitter and other systems of \u201Cvalue capture,\u201D the feeling of knowing something really clearly can foreclose on the desire for nuance, and the pleasures and perils of \u201Cmoral outrage porn.\u201DShow NotesPolarization or Propaganda?

      "description": "News from Alabama: after a 23-year ban on yoga in schools, generated by a Republican moral panic, Governor Kay Ivey signs a bill that lets kids do yoga again, but with some restrictions:\u201CAll instruction in yoga shall be limited exclusively to poses, exercises, and stretching techniques. All poses shall be limited exclusively to sitting, standing, reclining, twisting, and balancing. All poses, exercises, and stretching techniques shall have exclusively English descriptive names. Chanting, mantras, mudras, use of mandalas, induction of hypnotic states, guided imagery, and namaste greetings shall be expressly prohibited.\u201DThose who promote yoga as a universal good will welcome this Indian art form being made more accessible for children in a State with terrible educational markers. Hindu nationalists, on the other hand, may be outraged at a secularized version of yoga, stripped not only of references to Hinduism, but of signs of any type of Indian spirituality. And a lot of white yoga progressives will look at this policy\u2014mostly from the urban North\u2014 and worry about authenticity and appropriation.How will the children feel?In considering who wins and loses with this new development, Matthew reviews recent U.S. yoga-war history: battles between the Hindu American Foundation and Yoga Journal, the rise of Christian non-yoga-yoga \u201CPraise Moves\u201D, and Encinitas Union School District got sued for allegedly violating the Establishment Clause by contracting devotees of Pattabhi Jois to teach the kids yoga.It\u2019s not a stretch to see an overlap between this theme and the medical-moral panic over vaccines.

      "description": "By the 1990s, the sadistic cult leader who claimed to be God on Earth had already fled the United States to avoid a stack of lawsuits and potential criminal charges. Even still, highly influential spiritual intellectual Ken Wilber was calling him the \u201Cgreatest living realizer,\u201D privately saying he was \u201Chappy about how many people had found their way to Adi Da through reading my books.\u201DWilber later modified his model of stages of spiritual development to try to account for supposedly enlightened beings who were awful people. In this week\u2019s Bonus episode, Julian recounts this story of a sociopathic holy man and his brilliantly naive enabler\u2014which culminates in a wickedly illustrative thought experiment! -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

His \u201CDisinformation Dozen\u201D white paper made a huge splash, prompting a conference call with Nancy Pelosi\u2019s team ahead of their biannual grilling of Zuckerberg and Dorsey. Ahmed\u2019s paper spotlights the fact that 65% of anti-vax content originates from just 12 social media figures. Conspirituality superstars Sayer Ji, Kelly Brogan, and Christiane Northrup hold positions 8, 9, and 10. Ahmed wants them deplatformed\u2014and he\u2019s making it happen. In response, the Dozen are raising money and having themselves caricatured as superheroes.Who have they been deceiving and emotionally abusing? This week Matthew interviews Heather Simpson and Lydia Greene from Back to the Vax, an anti-disinformation think-tank they founded after fleeing the online cult of anti-vax propaganda. In their first interview together, Simpson and Greene recount how mother-centered anti-vax social media spaces drew them in and exposed them to all manner of anxious conspiracism\u2014and what it cost them to leave. They\u2019ve got a very clear message about how public health communications can meet this entrenched challenge.In the Ticker, Julian tracks the Dozen\u2019s emerging strategy, Derek finally addresses the English elephant in the room, Russell Brand, and Matthew takes an early look at the big reveal of Cullen Hoback\u2019s Q: Into the Storm on HBO.Show NotesWhat \u201CCauses\u201D Covid?

      "description": "Conspiritualists hide their grifts in mantras. MLMs market themselves as communities, while cults preach freedom. When a research firm spotlights Sayer Ji as a disinformation super-spreader, he calls them a hate group. When Lil Nas X spins a catharsis of gay-goth dreams, he embodies MAGA disgust. It\u2019s an age of misdirection.It\u2019s also an age of transference. Living and breathing people become memes. The impulse to communicate gets devoured by the need to perform. Drives to justice adopt dominant affects.\u00A0 Real conspiracies get overshadowed by myths. We\u2019re keeping ourselves very busy while the world burns,\u0027This week we\u2019re releasing a bonus episode into the wild that speaks to a small wedge of the transference game. Matthew contemplates what it means, in both helpful and unhelpful ways, to be named as or reduced to \u201Ccis white men\u201D, and how important issues can get lost in the dead zone between culture wars and cults.Both conspirituality and social media influence are driven by the hot take, the keyword, the avatar, and the speed of emotional reactivity. And cults are glued together by intense, non-negotiable emotional demands on participants. So far we\u2019ve shown how all of these elements degrade our chances to evaluate evidence and resist being conned by charismatics or cult leaders. Our hope is that we contribute to a slower and open-ended exploration of how to balance the rhetoric of social change with the nuance of interpersonal empathy.In the Ticker, Derek looks at the retraction crisis plaguing scientific research. Julian watches Lil Nas X lap-dance through the MAGA homo-pocalypse.

In this episode, we\u2019ll review how the first two episodes of Cullen Hoback\u2019s \u201CInto the Storm\u201D lands, and wonder about what happens when conspiracy movements come under big-screen and academic scrutiny.Cullen embedded within the labyrinthine Q-world for almost four years. He globetrotted, gaining incredible access to a network of social avoidants and keyboard warriors. His sympathy is both touching and problematic. Our own embedding in the wellness world \u2014 sixty years between the three of us \u2014 hasn\u2019t been quite so weird or dangerous. But it does raise a similar question: how clearly can we see the conspirituality of the world we\u2019ve worked in for so long? As Cullen tries to draw out the humanity and intentionality of the QAnons, how are we understanding \u2014 or missing \u2014 our own subjects? Then there\u2019s the question of impact. Will America understand itself more clearly after Cullen\u2019s work? And where will the scholarship on conspirituality go after we dump our research on that conference table?In the Ticker this week, we review the new Lululemon mat, report on how Imran Ahmed\u2019s team at the CCDH identified the social media Disinformation Dozen and succeeded in partially deplatforming conspiritualist power-couple Sayer Ji and Kelly Brogan.

      "description": "Back in December, a certified anesthesiologist named Dr. Madhava Setty posted a long critique of our podcast to the New Age website Collective Evolution. While cordial and apparently well-meaning, Setty\u2019s essay failed to quote a single episode. Setty filled in his own blanks with outright misrepresentations, leading with: \u201CMatthew, Derek and Julian\u2026 assume that there are no large conspiracies in play in our world at this time. To state it flatly, to them the idea of a large conspiracy is so preposterous that they cannot even see that they are making an assumption when dismissing the possibility.\u201DThere\u2019s no planet on which any of our episodes have said anything of the kind. In fact, we\u2019ve repeatedly affirmed the opposite: that conspiracy theories and conspiritualists that monetize them exist because real conspiracies traumatize people. Tuskegee happened. MKUltra was real. #savethechildren took hold in part because Jeffery Epstein\u2019s network has not yet been fully understood or prosecuted.Setty is so well-mannered and convincing, however, that New Age influencers who might be feeling a little defensive about how the yoga and wellness world has shown its ass in 2020 have welcomed his dulcet tones with open arms. In one appearance, he guested on J. Brown\u2019s Yoga Talks podcast, and provided a master class on how to lead an anxious and altruistic yoga devotee into conspirituality. We didn\u2019t respond to Setty\u2019s initial essay because there was nothing to respond to: he didn\u2019t offer any data. But now we think it\u2019s worth examining in detail how, in real time \u2014 and before he winds up on Joe Rogan \u2014 he seductively spins together theories about divine consciousness, 9/11, COVID, and how everything is not as it seems.In the Jab, Julian reviews the scare-mongering of the newest seemingly-qualified anti-vax doc, Geert Vanden Bossche.

      "description": "This episode follows up on earlier discussions on the podcast about how we manage privilege. Our exploration of cancel culture \u2014 specifically that part of it that is really a form of horizontal violence \u2014 isn\u2019t motivated by any shift to the right, but by a desire to unpack the rhetoric, jargon, and performative behaviours, that, so often in the reductive rhythm of social media, serve to shut down learning, and polarize progressives that might otherwise work together.Here, Matthew focuses on how a rhetorical device in social justice relates to our project: what it means, in both helpful and unhelpful ways, to be named as or reduced to \u201Ccis white men\u201D.Reduction and essentialism are key aspects of the meme-ification of our politics, and potent weapons in the arsenal of conspirituality. None of the influencers we study on this podcast would have gained their social power without labelling and essentializing their opponents in black-and-white terms, without taking black-and-white positions on things like vaccines, big Pharma, and whether or not a person is \u201Cawake\u201D.Both conspirituality and social media influence are driven by the tag, the hot take, the keyword, the avatar, and the speed of emotional reactivity. And cults are glued together by intense, non-negotiable emotional demands on participants. So far we\u2019ve shown how all of these elements degrade our chances to evaluate evidence and resist being conned by charismatics or cult leaders. Our hope is that we contribute to a slower and open-ended exploration of how to balance the rhetoric of crucial social change with the nuance of interpersonal empathy.Show NotesContraPoints on Cancelling Robin diAngelo defining \u201Cwhite fragility\u0022\u201CPeggy McIntosh\u2019s White Privilege Knapsack\u201CThat time I didn\u2019t get shotMinimization as a patriarchal reflexCedric Michael Williams on DiAngelo Daniel Bergner on DiAngelo Tada Hozumi, Selfish ActivistLog the Fuck Off, Jacobin -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

You watch Milo Yiannopolous and Gavin McInnes fake-kiss in front of the police-taped club and say that the Muslims are coming to kill all gay people. YouTube\u2019s algorithm spins you downward into anti-Islamic content. Before long, you\u2019ve left your marketing job with a mission: to make slick propaganda videos for some of the most despicable alt-right ghouls on the planet.

In episode 6, Steve Hassan advised listeners to treat people under the undue influence of QAnon and conspirituality with welcome and respect. Castigation won\u2019t work. Shame will make things worse. He told this story about how his elderly neighbor brought him homemade cookies when he finally returned home after years in the cult of Rev. Moon.

Young white supremacist poster-boy Richard Spencer and edgy internet crypto-racists like Lauren Southern, Mark Cernovich, and Gavin McInnes led the viral charge, racking up subscribers while lining their pockets on the side. Daniel Lombroso of The Atlantic embedded with their ilk from 2016-18, collecting enough footage to release the award-winning documentary, White Noise. Julian sat down to talk with him about the movement, and about making this film while Jewish.Was any of this a surprise to anti-oppression activists on the ground? Not according to Michelle Cassandra Johnson, author of Skill in Action: Radicalizing Your Yoga Practice to Create a Just World. While the white supremacy Lombroso whistleblows is spectacular and absurd, the white supremacy Johnson and other justice activists feel in their bones has been a centuries-long war of attrition against equality.

      "description": "What are we learning about conspiracies, conspiracy theories, and those who hold them? How are we maintaining our optimism that facts are real, that they can be discovered, and shared? How will we continue to communicate with those who are confused? In this episode, we continue our rich conversation on the proximity of conspiracism and spiritual paths and the ways in which we fall into and climb out of fever dreams. In the Jab, Julian looks at concerns about vaccines and pregnancy. In a Ticker segment, Matthew ponders the British Wheel of Yoga\u2019s \u201Cneutral\u201D stance towards the COVID vaccine, and how it unintentionally welcomes conspiratorial thinking. Republic of Lies author Anna Merlan sits down with Derek to discuss the process of embedding with conspiracy consumers and peddlers, and the challenges faced when reporting on them. Discussing the interview, Julian uses the ideas of George Lakoff to think about containment and reframing. Matthew looks at how yoga and wellness influencers can play both sides of the consumer/peddler coin through the paradoxical private spectacle of social media.Show Notes\u2018I Miss My Mom\u2019: Children Of QAnon Believers Are Desperately Trying To Deradicalize Their Own ParentsBritish Wheel of Yoga indulges vaccine \u201Cneutrality\u201DDr. Victoria Male on vaccines and pregnancyAnna Merlan on the Austin Influencer MovementAnna Merlan on PBS\u2019s Open MindYoga podcaster J.

How many of us knew that our fetish for the \u201Cnatural\u201D could lead towards a consumerist cul-de-sac or fascist ideology?In this episode we contemplate the meaning, practice, delusions, and hypocrisies of the \u201Cnatural.\u201D Derek talks to \u201CSea of Shadows\u201D director Richard Ladkani about how the hunt for Traditional Chinese Medicine remedies has devastated the ecology of Baja California. Julian thinks about the disenchantment of the lab coat and how it drives so many to the warm regard of the \u201Cnatural healer.\u201DTo find out more about how some practitioners of complementary medicine are attempting to bridge the evidence and ideological gap with conventional care, Matthew interviews Naturopathic Doctor Juniper Martin and fourth-year student Adriana Berusch Gerardino about their efforts with the Naturopathic Alliance to dispel COVID misinformation and to challenge racism in their profession.Show NotesGina Carano fired by Lucasfilm (and publicist and agent) for antisemitic Q-Trump social activityRFK finally gets deleted by IGTurn Off Your Mind, Relax\u2014and Float Right-Wing?Chairman Mao Invented Traditional Chinese MedicineQAA shines on with Episode 128Dale Beran\u2019s extraordinary book It Came from Something AwfulDecoding the Gurus launches the GurometerShouting out to Katya Weiss-Anderson of Kumbaya ConfessionalChinese gov and state media boost TCM COVID treatments at home and abroadArticle: Acupuncture Doesn\u2019t WorkDr. Lad\u2019s kindly but rather banal Ayurveda advice re: COVID (August) -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

Matthew looks at Guru Jagat\u2019s (Katie Griggs\u2019s) pseudo-Tibetan mystical poem dedicated to her ex-con mentor, Harijiwan (Stephen Hartzell), whose current wife, Mandev, is about 30 years his junior and makes RA MA propaganda films. Will RA MA survive lockdown with COVID-busting mantras? Will Yogi Bhajan\u2019s crimes be washed away by the ringing of the RA MA gong?We know by now that cults never let a good crisis go to waste. We\u2019ll also examine how, when there are no global panics for cults to monetize, it\u2019s up to the leader to create one. With RA MA we see the cycle go intergenerational as it cultjacks Yogi Bhajan\u2019s legacy of fantasy and paranoia.For the Ticker this week, Derek and Julian review Bill Maher\u2019s platforming of Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying as they trot out vax-doubt and the Wuhan lab conspiracy.

      "description": "Episodes 36 \u0026 37 cover how Guru Jagat (Katie Griggs) and her Venice Beach RAMA Institute have pivoted in the COVID era to a new area of focus: anti-lockdown, anti-\u201Cwoke\u201D rhetoric, anti-masking, and anti-vax propaganda. As the center of her own weather system in the wider Kundalini Yoga / 3HO cult, this serves Griggs in a number of ways, from driving engagement to obscuring 2020\u2019s revelations of just how criminal her umbrella organization is.Cults will never let a good crisis go to waste. Back in the summer, Matthew noticed that Michael Roach, who led the cult he was recruited into from 1996-99, also pivoted to COVID content. He does it with a lot more credibility than Griggs does, but in some ways, this makes it even more obnoxious. In this bonus episode, Matthew analyzes his late-summer \u201CLove in the Time of the Virus\u201D content as a retread of what he\u2019s put out there for more than 20 years now.Sinking into Michael\u2019s vibe again after all these years brings up old questions for Matthew around earnestness and delusion, altruism and manipulation. It makes him wonder whether a cult\u2019s dogged fixation on doctrine can sometimes be an artifact of the leader\u2019s arrested development.Show NotesNina Burleigh\u2019s profile in Rolling StoneScott Carney\u2019s investigation of the death of Ian Thorson (originally in Playboy)My own somewhat cranky review of Carney\u2019s work -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "What happens when a charismatic yogalebrity rises to prominence in LA\u2019s fashion and wellness scene, gets exposed as an inheritor of a notorious cult, and then gets sideswiped by a pandemic? Meet Katie Griggs, aka \u201CGuru Jagat,\u201D who, instead of reassessing her channelled \u201Cdownloads\u201D from the charlatan rapist Yogi Bhajan and lending a hand to public health, has chosen to boost her online game with COVID contrarianism and by platforming David Icke.Our guests this week are Philip Deslippe and journalist Stacie Stukin. Philip\u2019s penetrating and bulletproof research into the dodgy history of Kundalini Yoga and its criminal founder Yogi Bhajan shook the modern yoga world in 2012. Stacie\u2019s 2020 LA Magazine feature investigation into Kundalini corruption and abuse gathered decades of buried evidence. Together they paint a lucid, non-sensationalized picture of how a high-demand religious group navigates new opportunities for manipulation.The larger picture is that COVID has been a challenge for the brick-and-mortar assets of cults, which, like every other business, rely on pedestrian traffic and the \u201Cretail space\u201D of ritual conversion. But in other ways, COVID is the best thing that could have happened to cults. Kundalini Yoga was built on promising perfect health, the conversion of fear into love, and a golden age free from atheistic biotech. For people like Griggs\u2014and her ex-con mentor Harijiwan\u2014COVID is an opportunity to hide dirty laundry and market the same empty promises with heightened panic and passion.Show Notes\u201CFrom Maharaj to Mahan Tantric: The Construction of Yogi Bhajan\u2019s Kundalini Yoga\u201D for Sikh Formations by Philip Deslippe (2012)\u201CYogi Bhajan Turned an L.A.

It\u2019s the perfect time to talk about where mystical or deceptive knowledge comes from, how it works, and what happens when it fails. We may never know who Q was, but we can take a close look at a core feature of conspirituality technique: the transmission of secret knowledge.

The death count is six (for now), with a second police officer dying by duty-related suicide on Saturday. As more footage streams in\u2014and the FBI says there\u2019s still more to come\u2014it will get uglier.So what have our conspiritualists been up to? We\u2019ll run it down this week. Quick story: not a single one has walked back any of their bullshit in the aftermath of the Capitol siege. Some have doubled down.An unmasked Mikki Willis was involved in the siege as a \u201Cjournalist,\u201D giving an impassioned anti-vax, pro-liberty speech at a sideshow MAGA event in which he called the ransack that he had just taken part in \u201Cbeautiful.\u201D Christiane Northrup cheered on the alt-health berserkers during the end of her water fast. Zach Bush took to Instagram to sermonize, saying, \u201CJust as viruses do not take down healthy humans, revolutions do not take down healthy governance.\u201D Lori Ladd spoke in radiant non-sequiturs.Amber Sears announced she was \u201Cpreparing for civil war\u201D while her husband JP whined about free speech as his Parler account got nuked and Trump got booted off of Twitter.

      "description": "Christiane Northrup addresses her followers as \u201Cangel warriors.\u201D JP Sears counsels his supplement customers to never \u201Coutsource their own truth.\u201D Mikki Willis says he was once a \u201Chero of the left\u201D, and now tells audiences that he\u2019s willing to die for the truth of his message. It\u2019s all very grand, and it doesn\u2019t come from nowhere. Trendy spiritualities of the privileged and disconnected have always focused on the heroic triumph of the individual, which has made them easily co-optable by the right.But what is a real hero? Joseph Campbell contextualized their journey as a ritual of selfless wandering, undertaken on behalf of the community. The concept of the monomyth, which Campbell defined as the Hero\u2019s Journey, has stages, and they have influenced popular culture in profound and, at times, troubling ways.In this episode, we\u2019ll look at how certain influencers confuse heroism for megalomania and forget that heroes and their societies are interdependent. Derek and Julian measure some of the usual suspects against Campbell\u2019s ruler while Matthew asks questions about what makes a theory vulnerable to distortion. In The Jab, Julian looks at the three top questions vaccine-hesitant folks have about the mRNA vaccines currently approved for COVID. In a closing essay, Matthew reflects on a space where the painful splits of conspirituality might be calmed: how the home hospice can bring together public health and private spirituality.Show NotesJake Angeli, \u201CQ-Shaman\u201D, describing his New-Age servicesCNN on Angeli, \u201CBaked Alaska\u201D and BarnettThe Q shaman \u2014 conspirituality runs riot on Capitol HillBarnett and \u201CSave Our Children\u201D event in AR in OctoberJP Sears echoes a justification for ransacking Pelosi\u2019s officeAnti-maskers Storm California Mall, Harass Shoppers and Refuse to LeaveWhy Lisa Guerrero Abruptly Ended Interview With Anti-Mask WearerTommy John Sr. hospitalized for COVIDDr. Tommy John denies his father hospitalized with COVID has COVID(Tommy\u2019s follow-up post shows his son (?) playing a video game in a COVID-denyi -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

Are we getting our bearings yet? Will we see land soon?This episode is centered on Part 2 of Matthew\u2019s discussion with Charles Eisenstein \u2014 a bellwether for the possibility that wellness and spirituality culture can communicate clearly about conspirituality. In the discussion and analysis that follows the interview, we look at who gets to say what and from which platform, what it means to be brave versus what it means to be evidence-based, and whether South Park really did predict the Trump-Biden choice.In the Ticker, we\u2019ll peek into the bizarro world of Guru Jagat, run down what anti-vaxxers believe about ingredients, ogle at Michael Flynn\u2019s QAnon merch shop, and dive into Lori Ladd\u2019s recent video where she rallies the troops after a revelatory nap.

      "description": "This episode dropped for our Patreon supporters on the darkest day of the year. We\u2019re unlocking it as a holiday gift to all of our listeners.In this meditation, Matthew reflects on the roots and implications of \u201Cblazes of light\u201D that punctuate the speech of both spiritualists and conspiritualists, from the spaces of patriarchal religious ritual to the claustrophobia of the manosphere. One key question: How does the manosphere shape conspirituality and its emotional disorders?This is a tour through the trance states that charismatic men love and manipulate\u2014how they carry streams of emotion that can never be transparently shared. Matthew investigates the means by which the podcast format squeezes entranced speech into a man-cave so that the speaker can be endlessly extroverted, but also self-protected, and mostly unaccountable.It is an ethereal and frictionless technology, imposing no limits on the impulse to hold court or to dominate. It allows Alex Jones, Jordan Peterson, Dr. Tommy John, JP Sears, and many others to create limitless self-centered content with almost no feedback. The lack of reality-checking makes their discourse aggressive, but it\u2019s also tragic to watch men believe they are forming relationships while they talk into the void.No solstice bonus wouldn\u2019t be complete without a nod to the light, however. Matthew climbs back out of this episode with some good man-news about his podcast colleagues, the Mandolorian, and the possibility that his own boys might grow up differently.Show NotesJordan Peterson weeps over individualismInstagram isolation curated by Dr. Tommy JohnJP Sears plays toady to Tim Kennedy\u2019s alpha-fashy rantKennedy implies he\u2019s helping disappear protestors in Portland -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

In a culture dominated by \u201Cexperts\u201D on social media, do charismatics outperform fact-checkers?This episode marks a milestone for our podcast, as Matthew interviews Charles Eisenstein, whose essay \u201CThe Coronation\u201D has cast a long shadow on our ongoing critique of how New Age and spiritual spaces interact with public health. It\u2019s a respectful but robust conversation about the limits of what laypeople can know about science and journalism, the intersection between conspiracy theory and myth, what the word \u201Cnarrative\u201D really means, and whether activism on the left and conspiracy theories on the right can be equally misguided.

Here\u2019s a taste.Bro Science is junk science spewed by men who believe their charisma is a substitute for training. It brags, mocks, overreaches. It\u2019s self-serving and self-interested.

We\u2019ll also continue with \u201CThe Jab\u201D, our segment on conspirituality-driven vaccine hesitancy.The big news this week is the resurrection of Jordan Peterson. After surviving a medically-induced coma in a Russian rehab facility, and then COVID on top of that, Peterson has re-emerged, weakened but resolute, as both hero and provocateur. The announcement from Penguin Canada that his new book of another dozen self-help rules prompted Penguin employees to protest their involvement in an emotional town hall.In this episode, we\u2019ll dive into Peterson\u2019s imaginarium. We won\u2019t totally discount his button-down commonsensical advice, but we will explore how it has lent intellectual support to the alt-right. Is he a conspiritualist pioneer as he wars against the Neo-Marxist Cabal and dreams of a Jungian promised land? Matthew will add a view from Peterson\u2019s hometown of Toronto, where the messianic prof has been open about his ambitions in right-wing Ontario politics.

      "description": "Do famous people become famous for staying in their lane? Do some find fame by carving out a lane that never existed before? What is the disruptive promise of charisma in this wellness space, which draws consumers burdened by a double disillusionment? They arrive, disillusioned by conventional medicine and conventional religion. What can the charismatic influencer offer them, and how do they do it?In this last free bonus episode, Matthew explores the charismatic logic of wellness, in which yoga teachers can become famous by playing at being doctors,\u00A0 and doctors can become famous by playing at being priests. Starting with the strange tale of BKS Iyengar (and how he stretched his way into all three roles through sheer will), this journey will lay out how the basic schtick of the 20th-century the wellness personality has primed the ground for our current explosion in conspirituality.Matthew will look at how MDs like Tom Cowan, Kelly Brogan, Christiane Northrup, and Zach Bush all run the \u201CIyengar Arc\u201D in reverse. Where the yoga master was unschooled in medicine, these doctors are unschooled in spirituality. But that doesn\u2019t stop them from pretending to be experts in a weird cocktail that fails both. In their aspirations to spiritual leadership, they each screw the pooch. Cowan ends up shilling for Rudolf Steiner, who knew nothing about viruses, and even less about how not to be a racist. Brogan thinks that Kundalini Yoga is \u201Cthousands of years old\u201D even though it was invented by a sociopath in the 1970s. Northrup seems to think that angel channelers are qualified to tell people how to live. And Zach Bush recounts a mystical experience to a group of retreatants in Italy, in which he became a sardine, and realized he wasn\u2019t afraid to die\u2014partly why he uses Reiki instead of pain medication when he\u2019s on the hospice shift.Ultimately, the \u201Ccharismatic collapse\u201D between doctor and priest distorts medicine and makes spirituality banal.

      "description": "Diversity has lost some of its strength as a term in our bifurcated world, and yet in nature diversity has always mattered. Our apprehension of using the word points to our further alienation of nature\u2014and ourselves. Derek discusses the power of diversity in three realms he has spent decades studying: international music, fitness, and psychedelics. He also contemplates why diversity matters when considering the growing influence of conspiritualists. -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "Trump\u2019s personal pastor Paula White seizes the podium to speak in tongues and prophesize that angels from Africa will certify her master\u2019s electoral victory. Evangelical Kenneth Copeland laughs maniacally at the devilish proposition that Biden has won. They both yearn to squeeze some drop of ecstasy from the husk of conservative politics. How much of the emotional terrorism rolling through these times is the return of the repressed?  In our weekly reporting, Derek looks at Australian chef Pete Evans and his nostalgia for fascist mysticism, hidden beneath green shakes and doTerra downlines. Julian covers Dr. Northrup\u2019s latest viral science fictions, as well as the bizarre Nazi comparisons trending on conspiritualist pages. Matthew looks at nested repressions returning with a vengeance: QAnon resurrecting the Satanic Panic, Bill Gates as the return of the vampire, and the strange new phenomenon of the Aggro-Spiritual Boss Babe Rage Witch, whose coin seems to be on the rise just as the Mark Walsh Spiritual Pick-Up Artist currency tanks. He also considers distinctions between canceling and punching sideways, picking up from last week\u2019s episode.  Then, in a rich interview with author of The Immortality Key, Brian Muraresku, Derek explores the ancient psychedelia of Christianity, both forgotten and repressed, and hopes for its return, as it would probably make Paula White and Kenneth Copeland chill TF out.

      "description": "On Election night, Mikki Willis, JP Sears, Del Bigtree, and the conspirituality glitterati gathered in Austin for a prayer meeting for Donald Trump. Willis pitched his new documentary and complained about Marxist professors pied-pipering children towards BLM before a new-age preacher sold allotments in a new alt-health ranch community in Texas. Derek covers this ultimate reveal of the conspirituality grift: predict the apocalypse, then sell off-grid cribs on a five-acre manmade lagoon. Fill the swamp, indeed.  Meanwhile, Julian covers the election of Marjorie Taylor Greene and Madison Cawthorn, QAnon arrests in Philly, and the shitstorm of irate comments against YogaGirl as she stands up for decency.  The election over, our critical work continues. How do we keep it on target? How do we make sure that we don\u2019t become so cynical\u2014or so attached to the process of criticism itself\u2014that we can\u2019t find solidarity? And how do we look for solutions while enthralled by social media, as opposed to being invested in society?  Our guests this week are Clementine Morrigan and Jay from Fucking Cancelled. Matthew will be asking them about the work that the digital Left can do to foster solidarity, loyalty, and freedom. It\u2019s an important conversation because we have to assume that some of the redpilled were already being pushed out the door. Why? Because among the woke-ish, it can be easier to fight each other than to punch up and get things done.

      "description": "Mark Walsh, the proprietor of The Embodiment Conference, was recently challenged by cultural somaticist Tada Hozumi in an Open Letter, penned by Hozumi in lieu of accepting the invitation to speak at the Conference. Hozumi proposed that Walsh look more closely at the exclusionary economy of his ambitious project \u2014 specifically, at how it centers white men as the heroes of the somatic techniques that colonialism handed them. The letter, dignified and sincere, offered a concise and workable framing of a fraught issue. Walsh did not respond directly, but on his personal Facebook shitposted about being oppressed by \u201Cc*ntery\u201D of social justice \u201Ctwats.\u201DThose familiar with this aspect of Walsh\u2019s online persona were not surprised. He has openly risen to market dominance in the online somatasphere as a kind of Black Belt culture warrior, a Jordan Peterson in a jock-strap. In this bonus episode, Matthew reviews some of Walsh\u2019s past online hits as a case study of how the wellness world can confuse acting out for freedom, somatic dominance for discipline, and allow charismatic men to weaponize unhealed wounds in the name of authenticity.Show NotesOpen Letter to Mark Walsh and The Embodiment ConferenceThe Embodiment Conference and \u201Csomafascism\u201D: commentary from Ben SpatzMark Walsh to 2020 TEC invited presenter (the audio is from 2019)Statement: We need to divest from Mark Walsh and The Embodiment ConferenceYes, Mr. Walsh, there are Black people in Hungary.

We could sense that our footholds of community, reasonable conversation, and consensus reality were eroding. As veterans of spirituality and wellness spaces, we\u2019ve always known that the reality has never lived up to the hype. But the intensification of conspirituality themes, incubating during lockdown into the peak fever-state of QAnon, has made this period especially demoralizing.

Louise Hay, for one, was fond of quoting it. Matthew proposes that A Course in Miracles is the unacknowledged in-house bible for Hay House.

She\u2019s got a story to tell: the culture of her publisher, Hay House, was so resistant to taking a position on the racist attitudes of some of their leading cash-cow authors that she ditched her contract and her job with the company as a diversity mentor.  We\u2019ll be talking about the money and politics of New Age media, as well as editorial standards, ghostwriting, cult apologetics, and the responsibility of publishers to deplatform authors that are hurtling toward QAnon.

Are conspiritualists really crossing over into militancy? Are the products of wellness so boring, and are the markets so saturated, that messianic influencers have no choice but to up the ante? Stone\u2019s recent interview guest, Christiane Northrup, recently invoked the sacred power of the Sheriff as the highest law in the land for anti-lockdown folks who believe they\u2019re being oppressed.

      "description": "The reality of a second COVID wave started back in the Spring. Now that With over half of American states are experiencing increased cases, the conspiracy theories are surging. At least 32 White House staff and allies, as well as the president and his wife, have tested positive, likely originating in an unmasked close-quartered super-spreader Rose Garden celebration of Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett.  As Trump poses for wheezing conquering hero propaganda following his questionable return from Walter Reed, another type of second wave is being led by brandwashed conspiritualists. Yoga and wellness loyalists are pushing back against criticism of their use of Q hashtags while reveling in mask opposition, anti-vaxxer agendas, and a distorted slacktivist approach to child trafficking that forms the foundation of QAnon. Pastel Q is surging.  This week, Julian investigates the terrifying Line In The Sand online conference, which featured friends of the pod, Mikki Willis, Zach Bush, Christiane Northrup, and many others. Matthew focuses on the chaos of charismatic leadership, weighing Trumpian tactics with the likes of Chogyam Trungpa and Yogi Bhajan. Derek explores the importance of creativity in the time of quarantine, leading into his interview with musician and former cult member, Ben Lee.  The entire crew also discusses Yoga Journal following the lead of the NY Times and Rolling Stone by reporting (and then bearing the backlash) on yoga community leaders taking a stand against QAnon\u2014and getting trolled by Q devotees in the process.

He\u2019s clearly not any one thing. But what is the one thing conspiritualists fantasize him to be? What archetypal role does he play for those who hate him?In this meditation, Matthew zeroes in on the briefly-mentioned biographical datum that Gates was bullied as a boy to unfold his symbolic power as neuroatypical scapegoat. If we listen carefully, he argues, we\u2019ll hear something very high-school-ish, laced with homophobia and latent violence, in the lazy defamations slung at Gates.\u00A0Is it a surprise that Trump graduated from the New York Military Academy in 1964\u2014the same year that a horrific hazing incident cost several administrators their jobs? Is it a surprise, given what we saw in that so-called debate, that Trump\u2019s school had written hazing into their cadet manual? No, it\u2019s not. And when Biden pauses and smiles, and shakes his head, and his gaze falls, is he remembering what it was like to have had a stutter in an all-boys school?\u00A0We spend a lot of time on this podcast unravelling the shoddy thinking at the heart of our conspirituality and political landscapes. These 24 minutes tackles primal cruelty that is up to men to address\u2014if they can remember it, and challenge that sad assumption that it\u2019s simply the way of the world. -- -- --Support us on PatreonPre-order Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat: America | Canada Follow us on Instagram | Twitter: Derek | Matthew | JulianOriginal music by EarthRise SoundSystem Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "Thirty-two days out from the election and every hour reveals another layer of intensity. The more widely conspirituality and QAnon spreads, the more normalized mundane political violence becomes.  In this episode, Derek looks at how the virus of conspiracism is now overtly threatening the basic premises of voting, as Emperor Trump projects a fiction about electoral fraud, even as he loses his clothes. Matthew looks at a crucial part of this normalization: how Q himself, whoever he is, is now brandwashing, advising followers to abandon familiar Q-words. How then are resisters like Seane Corn to address this brainworm as it shape-shifts, co-opting the visuals of wellness and even the jargon of social justice? Julian steps back for a broader look, reviewing the pod\u2019s discoveries and themes so far, and visualizing where they might lead.  We interview Mike Rains, one of the brave moderators of the 25K member subreddit QAnonCasualties, who has a lot to say about what the Q-hole feels like when it rips up hearts and homes.

They also explore the amazing world of \u201Cspiritual warfare handbooks,\u201D which have a history in US evangelicalism, are bestsellers in Q-land, and in some ways resemble new-age self-help manuals.

Julian delves into the muddy culture of yoga and antidepressants\u2014the bad advice, the stigma, the magical thinking. He also reviews the latest Q-adjacent content of Canadian self-help celebrity Danielle LaPorte, and checks in on Kate Northrup\u2019s interview with Zach Bush.  Derek and Julian interview Matthew about his recent feature investigation on conspirituality power couple, Dr. Kelly Brogan and Sayer Ji. There\u2019s lots of material that didn\u2019t make the final copy, like how Brogan\u2019s conspirituality could endanger the mental health of her online clients, and how her usage of Kundalini Yoga as a supplemental therapy is riddled with false historical and medical claims. Also: why didn\u2019t Sayer Ji denounce QAnon when given the chance?

American white supremacists chug gallons of local milk to prove their lactose tolerance and their claim that they alone should occupy the Global North.  Extreme examples aside: it\u2019s clear that key elements of the alt-right and the New Age agree that the Earth is sacred. Bountiful and healing, the Earth preserves everything lost to industrialization, Big Pharma, and globalization. Home is where the soil is. But whose home? Who\u2019s welcome here? Who can afford it? Who\u2019s allowed to own it, and who has to slave-labor on it? For all the supposed concern for ecology, why aren\u2019t we seeing conspiritualists and QAnon devotees marching against carbon emissions, celebrating the carbon drops of lockdown, supporting the migrant workers who pick their arugula, or starting community gardens in their food-desert cities?  This week Matthew reviews the soft-fascist \u201Cblood and soil\u201D themes of conspirituality culture. Derek gives some background and context on the romanticization problem with agriculture. And Julian looks at the quasi-scientific premises and promises that podcast fave Dr. Zach Bush offers in response. We also bring you an interview with farming activist John Roulac, who\u2019s incensed at how conspirituality is ripping up progressive foodie movements. In a recent article, he called out his old friends and associates (like Mikki Willis and Christiane Northrup) for what he calls their \u201Cbody-snatching\u201D beliefs.

      "description": "For decades, Neo-Tantra has focused on sex workshops and orgasmic bliss, overlooking the fact that the Kama Sutra is effectively a patriarchal instruction manual as well as Tantra\u2019s grassroots origins in the lower castes in Indian society, which were responding to lofty metaphysical ideas with practical rituals everyone could partake in. From that perspective, a modern industry marketed with Shiva-Shakti figurines is yet another example of capitalist yoga in a privileged society.  Derek opens this week discussing a redpilled-lite video by Danielle LaPorte, while Julian discusses an intensely personal story related to Tantra; he also explores the role of the Aghoris. We break from Tantra talk during Matthew\u2019s interview with Alex Auder, a veteran yoga instructor who uses comedy as a relief mechanism from the QAnon craziness in the yoga world. Matthew ends this week\u2019s episode with a reflection on his history with Tibetan Buddhist Tantra, and how he sees echoes of its archaic elements showing up, in undigested form, in the QAnon imaginarium.

      "description": "This week we announce and discuss a refinement in our podcast\u2019s direction. Real talk: conspirituality has clearly become both a front and a gateway for the fever-dream of QAnon. As mainstream news outlets wake up to the sordid reality that independent journalists have been tracking for two years, we find neither stream truly conceptualizing answers or methods for recovery and healing. Going forward, we\u2019re going to concentrate not only on critique, but also offering solutions.  Our guest this week is Lorna Liana, publisher of Entheonation. She tells Matthew about the insurgence of conspirituality in the plant medicine and ceremony world. Some neo-shamans, she says, are redpilling plant worshippers during vulnerable states.

      "description": "Last week, we started to explore how the real issue of child trafficking is being weaponized by bad-faith actors. This week we\u2019re joined by two experts that explain the overt and subtle impacts involved.  Regan Williams, CEO and founder of Seen \u0026 Heard, a nonprofit that provides youth in foster care with professional and personal development via the performing arts, offers a ground zero perspective of trafficked children and teens (and the people that actually care for them) being made even more invisible by conspiratorial clicktivism.  Religious Studies scholar and trauma-sensitive yoga consultant, Dr. Theo Wildcroft, joins us from England to discuss the consequences of trauma histories being hijacked for political and emotional manipulation. She offers insight into the mythic elements of conspirituality-to-Q that cannot be ignored if we want to understand how trauma is both stored and resisted.  On This Week in Conspirituality, Matthew considers the absurdity of David Wolfe accusing the medical community of not doing anything about cancer. Julian investigates anti-Semitic blood libel themes in QAnon and Derek discusses the chronic dangers of seeking utopia.

      "description": "Two of this podcast\u2019s hosts have been involved in destructive cult dynamics. Matthew\u2019s three years with Michael Roach and three years at Endeavor Academy are at the root of his cult research and journalism. Julian\u2019s six years in the inner circle around what he describes as Ana Forrest\u2019s incendiary and manipulative approach to yoga left him with repressed memories. Those experiences also left his family deeply scarred by some of the same Satanic Panic themes prevalent in the QAnon movement. His ongoing work advocating for critical thinking and community health is part of his recovery.  Derek describes himself as being \u201Ccult-adjacent\u201D\u2014not uncommon for a lifelong wellness industry professional. In this episode, he\u2019ll interview Julian and Matthew about their cult experiences, the recovery process, and cultic dynamics in modern yoga, Buddhist, and New Age communities informing the growing field of conspirituality.  They\u2019ll also discuss cultic organizations being ideally positioned to sell \u201CDisaster Spirituality\u201D (props to Naomi Klein) in times of crisis. Cult leaders understand the power of charisma, the attractiveness of transcendental ideology, and what it takes to make vulnerable people feel like every question is answerable with jargon, intrusive eye contact, and deeply deceptive shit. Matthew will ground the discussion with a synopsis of cult research, basic concepts, and useful definitions.

      "description": "A recent report by the UK\u2019s Center for Countering Digital Hate found that anti-vaxx organizations reach 58 million people on social media. The total amount of money spent by anti-vax groups and advertisers targeting their followers on Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube is roughly $1 billion. The majority of the money funding the most prominent anti-vax groups is by just two men: osteopath Joseph Mercola and fund manager Bernard Selz. All of this makes you wonder: Why is so money being used to target anti-vaxxers?  Derek interviews Imran Ahmed, founder of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, about how anti-vax leaders and groups are using social media to target and recruit followers. The stakes are higher than ever, as the vaccine argument has transcended autism and is threatening to endanger public health during the pandemic.  Julian considers the vaccine fears of parents as well as the shadow of the Tuskegee Syphillis Study, and how anti-vax alliances are targeting black communities, which could be a disastrous Trojan Horse for COVID-19, while Matthew serves up his This Week in Conspirituality segment in the epilogue, looking at how the leader of the high-demand group he was indoctrinated into over 20 years ago, led by Michael Roach, is rebooting old content as a COVID-era grift.

      "description": "Percolating alongside racism and classism, one of the most pernicious subtexts of conspirituality propaganda is ableism. Proponents spout accusatory mantras like: \u201CYou have an immune system!,\u201D \u201CYou\u2019d have nothing to worry about if you were vegan!,\u201D and, of course, \u201CLiving in fear is the real cause of disease.\u201D  Not only do these ideas have nothing to do with virology, they also condemn everyone who is immuno-compromised, living in a food desert, or managing trauma to the margins. COVID-19 has exposed the ugliest secret of wellness culture: the glorification of the self over concern about the community.  None of this is news for disability activists. In this episode, Matthew interviews Jivana Heyman, founder of Accessible Yoga and longtime AIDS activist, about walking the anti-conspirituality line between yoga and public health. Heyman also reveals how the past and present intersect in Tony Fauci, a leading figure in AIDS research during Reagan\u2019s tenure who is now being muzzled by Trump.  In This Week in Conspirituality, Julian looks at the fear of death through the lens of Ernest Becker and Joseph Campbell, Derek discusses free speech after Twitter removes 7,000 QAnon accounts, and Matthew tries to empathize with the \u201Cawakened\u201D aspect of conspirituality, i.e., What have they woken up to?

      "description": "OB/GYN Dr. Christiane Northrup has been a giant in women\u2019s healthcare advocacy for decades. She has persuasively argued for lower-intervention childbirth, an end to circumcision, and policies that place family unity at the heart of health care. She\u2019s known and loved for challenging her medical training with faith-based values and an intuition framed as feminine (if not feminist) and \u201Csovereign.\u201D  Northrup draws on astrology, feng shui, chakra theory, and \u201Cvibrational\u201D healing as modes of resistance to what she sees as medical patriarchy. This resistance began seamlessly intersecting with COVID trutherism in April, when she started posting daily Facebook sermons to her half-million followers. The series is called \u201CThe Great Awakening\u201D \u2014 a phrase first used to describe 18th-century American spiritual revival movements, but was recently co-opted by QAnon conspiracists to describe the inevitable triumph of Trump over the Deep State.  Northrup\u2019s sermons, combined with her posts of Plandemic, Tony Robbins interviewing anti-vaxxers, and a podcast with \u201CAndy\u201D Wakefield in which she called COVID a \u201Cflu\u201D and expressed concern about Bill Gates taking over public education, give a rich glimpse into the seduction of conspirituality in the hands of a wellness matriarch.  Most recently, Northrup has strengthened her alignment with QAnon by posting a trailer for a follow-up to a key recruiting video. With up to a dozen QAnon supporters running for office in November, Northrup is positioned to nudge middle-class white wellness women with money into a cult that believes Trump is a messianic figure.  This week\u2019s interview is with Britt Hermes, who earned her doctorate in naturopathic medicine from Bastyr University in 2011. After three years of practice, Hermes left the profession to became its most vocal public critic. We asked her to weigh in on women\u2019s wellness in the pandemic and the appeal of Dr. Northrup.

      "description": "It can be as hard to talk with your well-meaning yoga-world friend about their COVID-conspiracy beliefs as it is to talk with a family member about their devotion to Donald Trump. This isn\u2019t an accident \u2014 but it\u2019s not exactly by design, either. Both figures can seem trapped in filter bubbles of jargon that hypnotizes and cancels critical thinking. In this episode, we talk with pre-eminent cult researcher Steve Hassan about his new book, The Cult of Trump, and explore the overlaps between the cults of personality that destroy political, wellness, and spiritual cultures. We discuss changes in cultic technique in the age of lockdown, and how best to maintain contact with a person transformed by manipulation. The interview with Steven begins at the 37-minute mark.

      "description": "Conspiritualists are compelling for numerous reasons: they\u2019re charismatic; they claim to transcend polarized politics; they claim to speak the unspeakable in a quest for hidden truths. It makes sense that a key rhetorical instrument in their toolbox is poetry.  \u201CThe real virus is fear\u201D is a unifying metaphor for conspiritualists, but there are others. In conspiritual-ese, the immune system is like the Christian soul: eternal, perfect, and solitary. Masks are signs of submission that symbolize the suppression of free speech and even slavery. Public health departments are bureaucracies of death. Vaccines are poisons designed to demand compliance. Vaccinators are Satanic agents compelled to enter the sacred space of the body \u2014 especially the child\u2019s body \u2014 in order to possess it.  In this episode, Derek (cancer survivor), Matthew (pulmonary embolism survivor), and Julian (Lyme disease in remission) discuss the function of the beautiful and delusional metaphors of illness and transcendence in conspiritual-ese, applying the discoveries of Susan Sontag and Eula Biss.

      "description": "To the layperson, Dr. Zach Bush\u2019s vision of a resurrected microbiome as being the answer to modern illnesses sounds appealing. His basic argument: we\u2019ve been weeding ourselves to death, externally and internally, depleting the biodiversity of our soils and bodies. He seems to have done typical clinical work (in mostly private settings) in internal medicine, endocrinology, and hospice care. But with no publications or experience with epidemiology, why is he being tapped by anti-vax activists to speak on COVID-19.  Perhaps because when he runs up against the limit of his knowledge, he offers spiritual sermons. J.P. Sears does something similar, though from a different direction, without being signal-boosted by anti-vaxxers. Sears\u2019s deeper colors show when he reaches the limits of his satire: he\u2019s a life coach medical libertarian who\u2019s willing to cherry-pick data and mock concerns about the immunocompromised in support of\u2026we\u2019re not quite sure.

      "description": "Barely two weeks into various stages of lockdown around the world, New Age philosopher Charles Eisenstein published a 9,000-word essay on the meaning of the pandemic. He summed up his core theme with deft wordplay at about the 7,000-word mark. After suggesting that the global crisis afforded a kind of transformative opportunity, he writes \u201CNow the question arises: Initiation into what? What is the specific nature and purpose of this initiation? The popular name for the pandemic offers a clue: coronavirus. A corona is a crown. \u2018Novel coronavirus pandemic\u2019 means \u2018a new coronation for all.\u2019 What was so captivating about this essay that Jack Dorsey tweeted it to the 4.5M followers on his platform?

What are his connections to medical libertarianism, and how does he manage to endorse conspirituality while seeming to deconstruct it?
