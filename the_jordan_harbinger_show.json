      "description": "From Supreme Court infiltration to human trafficking, secretive Catholic cult Opus Dei wields dangerous power. Gareth Gore exposes its operations here! Full show notes and resources can be found here: jordanharbinger.com/1170 What We Discuss with Gareth Gore: Journalist Gareth Gore discovered secretive Catholic cult Opus Dei\u0027s control of Spain\u0027s Banco Popular through archived records after the bank\u0027s 2017 collapse \u2014 revealing decades of financial manipulation. Opus Dei recruits girls as young as 11 from poor communities, promising education but enslaving them as unpaid domestic workers in \u0022hospitality schools\u0022 worldwide. The organization has deeply penetrated US political circles, with connections to Supreme Court justices through Federalist Society leader Leonard Leo \u2014 potentially influencing major rulings. Members endure physical self-harm rituals, live under surveillance, and submit to \u0022chat\u0022 sessions that collect compromising personal information for manipulation. The good news: the vast majority of Opus Dei members are genuinely good people who\u0027d be horrified to learn about the trafficking and manipulation happening in their organization\u0027s name. New Pope Leo isn\u0027t just aware of Opus Dei\u0027s shenanigans \u2014 he began actively working to dismantle its power structure within hours of taking office. And much more...

      "description": "Striving to better yourself is a noble pursuit, and there are plenty of legitimate resources to help you navigate this journey. But how do you protect yourself against the unscrupulous shysters lurking in the shadows looking to exploit you at this vulnerable juncture? Welcome to Skeptical Sunday, a special edition of The Jordan Harbinger Show where Jordan and fact-checker, comedian, and podcast host David C. Smalley break down a topic that you may have never thought about, open things up, and debunk common misconceptions. On This Week\u0027s Skeptical Sunday:  Globally, the self-help industry brings in nearly $60 billion per year. But how much of this is generated by programs that actually help people better themselves? Under the surface, many so-called self-help groups are nothing more than cults that use coercive tactics \u2014 or even abuse \u2014 to keep their \u0022customers\u0022 in line. These groups cultivate dependency among the flock while escalating the price of admission. A healthy dose of skepticism and genuine connection with the outside world will help guard against such exploitation. Therapy, research, and self-guided approaches are better bets for promoting genuine well-being. Connect with Jordan\u00A0on Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube.

What We Discuss with Daniella Mestyanek Young:  How the seemingly wholesome Children of God (later known by variations of \u0022The Family\u0022) religious group centered around love, faith, and Jesus \u2014 and packaged to appeal to impressionable countercultural hippie types of the day \u2014 veered into true cult territory under the direction of its leader, David Berg. How female followers of Children of God were encouraged to use their bodies and sexuality to gain converts and money in a practice known as \u0022flirty flashing.\u0022 How child sexual abuse became a commonplace Children of God practice in an effort to raise \u0022sexually liberated\u0022 children. What this cult and others do to cultivate credibility \u2014 and raise funds \u2014 among its followers and the outside world. The toll that life in a cult takes on those who are lucky enough to exit. And much more...

      "description": "Steven Hassan\u00A0(@CultExpert) has helped thousands of individuals and families recover from undue influence (authoritarian control). With over 40 years of experience, he is sought after as one of the foremost authorities on undue influence and controlling groups and individuals. He is the founder of the Freedom of Mind Resource Center, and a founding collaborator of the #iGotOut movement. What We Discuss with Steven Hassan:  How a disinformation crusade like QAnon takes root and thrives in the politically polarized petri dish of modern America (with a little help from its outside adversaries). Why the trope of non-human elites ritualistically sustaining themselves on the essence of innocent children should seem familiar -- because this blood libel has been most famously used to normalize the persecution of Jews from the Middle Ages to the Holocaust and beyond. How QAnon appeals not only to the predictable dumber-than-a-box-of-rocks demographic, but a surprising number of seemingly otherwise intelligent people who are counterintuitively more susceptible to its influence than most. How Steven\u2019s BITE model applies to QAnon\u0027s manipulation of behavior, information, thought, and emotion among its followers to show it for what it is: a destructive cult with elements of psyops thrown in for good measure. What we can and should do when people we care about have been sucked down the QAnon rabbit hole\u00A0and we want to see them safely tethered back to reality. And much more...

What We Discuss with Steven Hassan:  How to use Steven\u0027s BITE model to tell if you or someone you love is involved in a destructive cult through control of behavior, information, thought, and emotion. The four types of destructive cults most prevalent today: commercial, religious, political, and self-help. How cults have weaponized the Internet and social media to fill their ranks and thrive as never before possible. Why it\u0027s the people who believe themselves immune to (i.e., too smart for) cult indoctrination who are most at risk of being targeted and recruited. How Steven has refined Ted Patrick\u0027s invasive cult deprogramming tactics of the \u002770s into a more effective strategic interactive approach.

If you want us to answer your question, register your feedback, or tell your story on one of our upcoming weekly Feedback Friday episodes, drop us a line at friday@jordanharbinger.com. Now, let\u0027s dive in! On This Week\u0027s Feedback Friday, We Discuss:  How can you prove that your teacher is name-grading essays without cheating on the paper? You\u0027re a veteran looking to transition back to civilian life. Here are some resources that might help (many thanks to your fellow veteran Zach Criswell for this info). When the big change you really need is a job opportunity at another company, is it unfair not to give your current employer a chance to negotiate with you to stay put? You\u0027re worried your significant other might have gotten wrapped up in an expensive self-help cult. What might you say to bring them gently back to Earth without wasting even more time and money? How do you find a lawyer who will actually get the job you need done and won\u0027t break the bank? An important network connection has offered to help you find opportunities as you\u0027re transitioning into a new field, but how can you ensure you\u0027re not biting off more than you can chew while still learning the ropes without wasting anyone\u0027s time? You\u0027re a contractor who has worked for a company that has been bought and sold three times in the past three years. How do you present this on your resume so it doesn\u0027t look like you\u0027ve worked for three companies in that time? You\u0027re in your fifties and looking to open a franchise, though you don\u0027t have direct retail experience. What should you do to minimize risk so you\u0027re not burdened with debt in your retirement years should things go south?
