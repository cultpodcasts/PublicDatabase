      "title": "The Fall of The House of York, with Andrew Lownie",
      "description": "Today, police arrested Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor on suspicion of misconduct in public office. The former Duke of York can be questioned and held without charge for up to 24 hours from the moment he arrived at the police station this morning. Andrew\u0027s new home - Wood Farm on the King\u2019s Sandringham estate - is currently being searched by Thames Valley Police, along with his former residence, Royal Lodge in Windsor. As this story continues to unfold, we\u0027re bringing you a previous edition of Deep Dive, in which Sarah Vine sat down with historian and author Andrew Lownie, whose revelatory book Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York set much of what we\u0027re witnessing today in sharp relief.

      "description": "Following the explosive revelations in the latest release of Epstein files, historian Andrew Lownie joins Sarah Vine to unpack what we know. The conversation covers the evidence that Epstein ran a blackmail operation with Russian intelligence connections, the wider royal family\u0027s knowledge of Andrew Mountbatten Windsor\u0027s activities, institutional cover-ups, and whether King Charles will address the crisis. Lownie argues this scandal surpasses Profumo in scale and represents a grave threat to public trust in British institutions. A Daily Mail Production. Seriously Popular. Hosted on Acast.

Forget Edward and Mrs Simpson, it\u2019ll take more than stepping back from the Royal spotlight to escape the allegations and shadows cast by Epstein and his island. In this latest episode Sarah Vine is joined by Andrew Lownie, historian, and author of the revelatory Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York to try to answer some of the questions surrounding Prince Andrew.
