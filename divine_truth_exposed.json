      "description": "For decades, the Worldwide Church of God \u2014 led by Herbert W. Armstrong \u2014 forbade Christmas, birthdays, and traditional Christian celebrations, claiming they were \u201Cpagan,\u201D \u201Cdemonic,\u201D and spiritually dangerous.\nThis documentary exposes the rise, dominance, and dramatic collapse of one of America\u2019s most authoritarian religious movements, revealing how fear replaced joy, doctrine replaced Scripture, and submission replaced faith.\n\nDiscover how Armstrong built an empire on control, how families were torn apart by strict bans, and how the entire system finally collapsed when truth became impossible to suppress.\n\nIf you care about faith, culture, religious history, or spiritual manipulation, this investigation is essential.",
