      "description": "For the first time in the We Were In a Cult? series, I\u2019m sitting down with a married couple who both experienced the pressures of purity culture, mission work, and the relentless push toward marriage inside the International Churches of Christ. In this episode, they share how dating was never about personal connection\u2014it was about proving your spirituality and being deemed \u0022worthy\u0022 to move forward. We dive into the concept of \u0022weasel dates,\u0022 the expectation to fast-track relationships toward marriage, and the exhaustion that came with constantly trying to meet the church\u2019s demands. From mission team burnout to the cult-like language of being \u0022souled out,\u0022 this conversation is a raw, unfiltered look at what happens when a church controls every aspect of your personal life\u2014including who you love and when. Listen now to hear their powerful story. If you are a member, were a member, or know someone who was a member of the ICOC or the ICC and would like to share your story of your life in and out of the church and help us maybe get closer to answering the question \u0022we were in a cult?\u0022, and maybe find some healing please contact me via email at clemenzwithaz@gmail.com or you can DM via Instagram at the \u0022Clemenz With a \u0022Z\u0022 podcast\u0022 Instagram page.

      "description": "Leaving isn\u2019t always a clean break\u2014sometimes, it takes a few tries. In this deeply personal episode of Clemenz With a Z, I share my journey of walking away from the ICOC... three times. From the pressure-packed Bible studies to the weight of guilt, shame, and trying to fit into a mold that never felt like me, this is the story of what it took to finally say enough. I talk about the fear of leaving, the hope that maybe things would change, and how stepping away felt like wandering into the wilderness\u2014terrifying, but ultimately freeing. Whether you\u2019ve wrestled with leaving a community, questioned your place in something you thought would be home, or just want to hear an honest journey of self-discovery, this episode is for you. Sometimes walking away isn\u2019t quitting\u2014it\u2019s the start of something real. If you are a member, were a member, or know someone who was part of the ICOC or ICC and would like to share your journey in and out of the church, I\u2019d love to hear from you. Together, we can keep exploring that question, \u201CWe were in a cult?\u201D\u2014and maybe, in sharing these stories, we\u2019ll find some healing along the way.

And don\u2019t forget: I\u2019m just a channel\u2014I ain\u2019t the source. When did worship music start to feel more like a concert than a connection? In this episode of Clemenz With a \u0022Z,\u0022 I dig into the weird, wild world of modern worship and Christian music\u2014where flashing lights, fog machines, and booming bass lines often take center stage. I\u2019m not here to tell you what\u2019s right or wrong\u2014I don\u2019t have the answers. I just know something about it makes me uncomfortable, and I wanted to talk about it. From childhood memories of reverent hymns led by my dad to walking into churches that look more like concert arenas, I\u2019m exploring how we got here... and what it supposed to be. Tune in, sit with the questions, and maybe even laugh a little as we unpack the line between heartfelt praise and full-blown production. Thank you for tuning in to this episode of Clemenz With a Z. Your support means the world to me and helps keep these important conversations going. If this episode resonated with you, challenged you, or just made you think differently about worship and Christian music, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts.

It\u2019s hard to say, and for some, it\u2019s hard to hear. But naming it gives me power over it. It makes healing possible. This is just the beginning. In Clemenz With a Z, I will continue unpacking my experiences in the ICOC through a new series of episodes titled This Was Supposed to Be the Place.

For this conversation, I\u2019m sitting down with someone who has had a front-row seat to my entire journey\u2014my wife, Carly. Unlike me, Carly didn\u2019t grow up in a high-control religious group. She never had to question whether leaving a church meant leaving God. But she did witness me navigate that journey. In this episode, we talk about those first couple of years in our relationship\u2014when I was fresh out of the ICOC, still carrying the weight of my past, still sorting through what I believed, and still surrounded by friends who were very much still in the church. Beyond my own story, we also discuss the role that partners play in supporting their loved ones through deconstruction, healing, and rebuilding a life outside of a controlling religious group. Carly\u2019s perspective as someone who wasn\u2019t indoctrinated but walked alongside me as I untangled my beliefs adds a whole new layer to the conversation. What does it look like to be there for someone without fully understanding what they\u2019ve been through? How can partners provide space, validation, and support while also maintaining their own perspectives? What was it like for Carly to watch me process all of this in real time? What did she notice that I couldn\u2019t see for myself? And from her perspective\u2026 was I in a cult? Let\u2019s talk about it. Thank you for tuning in to this episode of Clemenz With a Z.

Drawing from my own baptism experience, which was meant to be transformative but left me feeling exposed and disconnected, I explore how baptisms are often presented as high-production events with promotional t-shirts, branded backdrops, and curated social media moments. Together, we\u2019ll reflect on how these trends may overshadow the intimate, spiritual essence of baptism and discuss ways to bring back the focus on personal faith and transformation.

Today\u2019s episode kicks off a new series I\u2019ve been working on, asking a big question\u2014Are churches cults? In this exploration, I\u2019ll be diving into the similarities between churches like Hillsong and Mars Hill and the ICOC, which has often been labeled a cult. This week, I\u2019m sharing my experience at a local church, where the preacher\u2019s sermon took an unexpected turn. He warned the congregation against listening to the song Landslide by Stevie Nicks, framing it as spiritually dangerous. The way he used this example to manipulate fear in the audience really got to me. I\u0027ll break down his tactics and talk about why discouraging critical thought and open exploration like this can be harmful. Join me as we look at the power dynamics and manipulative strategies some preachers use, and ask the question\u2014is church just an accepted cult?",

Jocelyn shares how she was first invited into the church, the sense of community that initially drew her in, and the moments that led her to question whether she had become involved in something far more controlling than she had initially realized.

We\u2019ll discuss the painful realization that the church\u2019s promise that \u0027anyone could lead\u0027 was a lie\u2014a promise reserved only for those who fit a rigid mold.

Today, we dive deep into a compelling and often heartbreaking topic with our episode titled \u0022We Were In a Cult?\u0022 In this episode, we explore a story that spans five decades with our guest, Kathi, who began her journey in the 14th Street Church\u2014later known as the Crossroads Church of Christ, the genesis of the ICOC. Kathi was baptized at an early age, but as she got older, she felt the pressure to be baptized again\u2014something many members faced as the church\u0027s expectations evolved. In the beginning, Kathi found the church to be an amazing community that she truly loved. It was a place of belonging and spiritual growth. But as time went on, the cracks started to show. Kathi opens up about how the church\u0027s culture of control became stifling, where simply asking questions was viewed as an act of rebellion. She shares the pain of being labeled and ostracized by church leaders, and the heartbreak of seeing her own children turned against her. After leaving the ICOC for 10 years, Kathi returned\u2014this time to the ICC. However, to her dismay, she saw the same issues that plagued the ICOC resurfacing in the ICC as well. In this episode, we delve into the difficult emotions of witnessing the church\u0027s changes over the years and confronting the same problems in a new environment. Join us for an eye-opening conversation about faith, control, and resilience as Kathi shares her powerful and deeply personal story.

In this episode, we\u0027re joined once again by Nadine, who previously shared her experiences both in and out of the ICOC.

Today, she\u2019s back to answer those questions and to provide deeper insight into a significant part of her story. Also, Nadine was named in the infamous Henry Kriete letter, a document that shook the ICOC community to its core. She\u0027ll be sharing her personal perspective on being mentioned in the letter, the impact it had on her life, and how she has navigated the aftermath.

Today, we dive deep into a compelling and often heartbreaking topic with our episode titled \u0022We Were In a Cult?\u0022 Our guest today is Joabis, who stands out as the first member of the International Churches of Christ (ICOC) to join us while still being an active member of the church. Joabis\u0027s journey is truly international\u2014born in Africa, he moved to India where he was introduced to the ICOC and quickly ascended into leadership In our conversation, we delve into some deeply personal and challenging topics. Joabis shares his experience with arranged marriages within the church, including his own at a young age. As he poignantly put it, \u0022I got married for the ministry and left for the ministry.\u0022 We explore the struggles he faced to maintain both his marriage and his leadership position, and ultimately, how he made the difficult decision to step down from leadership in order to save himself and his marriage. What struck me most about Joabis is his unwavering positivity, his capacity for forgiveness, and his hopeful outlook on life and its endless possibilities. His story is a powerful testament to resilience and the human spirit, and I believe you\u0027ll find his perspective both enlightening and inspiring.

Today, we dive deep into a compelling and often heartbreaking topic with our episode titled \u0022We Were In a Cult?\u0022 Our guest this week is a brave former member of the International Churches of Christ (ICOC) Justine who grew up under our church\u0027s stringent control.\nIn this episode, we explore the profound impact of living in an environment where conformity was not just encouraged but enforced. Our guest shares her personal journey, revealing how the church\u0027s oppressive standards dictated her appearance and personality, going so far as to demand she re-dye her pink hair before her baptism to appear \u0022godly.\u0022\nMore than just a spiritual authority, the church acted as a surrogate parent, often overshadowing the influence and guidance of her actual parents. This dynamic further intensified the pressure to conform and exacerbated the struggles she faced as she navigated her identity.\nThis discussion sheds light on the severe consequences of such control, including her struggles with mental health and anorexia. Join us as we uncover the emotional and psychological toll of her life in the ICOC and her courageous path to healing and self-acceptance.\nTune in and be inspired by this powerful story of resilience and the quest for true identity and freedom.\nJustine is actively involved in the lawsuits against the ICOC and the ICC, supporting survivors in writing their plaintiff statements. She has also co-founded a nonprofit with Chele Roland called Free2B, which helps survivors of spiritual abuse find the resources they need to process their experiences in high-control groups. If you are a victim, you can reach out to Justine or Chele through the Free2B website: www.free2b.org.\nIf you are a member, were a member, or know someone who was a member of the ICOC or the ICC and would like to share your story of your life in and out of the church and help us maybe get closer to answering the question \u0022we were in a cult?\u0022, and maybe find some healing please contact me via email at clemenzwithaz@gmail.com or you can DM via Instagram at the \u0022Clemenz With a \u0022Z\u0022 podcast\u0022 Instagram page.\u00A0\nAs always, thank you for your continued support and if you like what you hear please rate and review!\u00A0 If you don\u0027t remember, I\u0027m just a channel, I ain\u0027t the source.\nIf you would like to support the podcast financially please follow this link: https://gofund.me/7ebb0524\nPeace!",

Our conversation centered mostly on what it was like as a \u0022kingdom kid\u0022 in the church and how much our view of reality and life was through the lens of the church and it\u0027s teaching.

If you are a member, were a member, or know someone who was a member of the ICOC or the ICC and would like to share your story of your life in and out of the church and help us maybe get closer to answering the question \u0022we were in a cult?\u0022, and maybe find some healing please contact me via email at clemenzwithaz@gmail.com or you can DM via Instagram at the \u0022Clemenz With a \u0022Z\u0022 podcast\u0022 Instagram page.

I was able to speak with former member of the !COC Steph about her life in the church and leaving the church. She did not stay in the church long after high school so the meat of the talk focused on what is was like being a kid/teen in the church. We touched on dating, purity culture, what it was like moving multiple times in the church, and being in a more affluent area of the church and not being affluent herself. It was a great talk and you all should check it out!
