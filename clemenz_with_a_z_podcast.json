Today\u2019s episode kicks off a new series I\u2019ve been working on, asking a big question\u2014Are churches cults? In this exploration, I\u2019ll be diving into the similarities between churches like Hillsong and Mars Hill and the ICOC, which has often been labeled a cult. This week, I\u2019m sharing my experience at a local church, where the preacher\u2019s sermon took an unexpected turn. He warned the congregation against listening to the song Landslide by Stevie Nicks, framing it as spiritually dangerous. The way he used this example to manipulate fear in the audience really got to me. I\u0027ll break down his tactics and talk about why discouraging critical thought and open exploration like this can be harmful. Join me as we look at the power dynamics and manipulative strategies some preachers use, and ask the question\u2014is church just an accepted cult?",

Today, we again dive deep into a compelling and often heartbreaking topic with our segment titled \u0022We Were In a Cult?\u0022 In this eye-opening episode of Clemenz with a Z, I sit down with former member Joselyn to discuss her experience with the International Churches of Christ (ICOC), a church that we all know has sparked both devotion and controversy. Jocelyn shares how she was first invited into the church, the sense of community that initially drew her in, and the moments that led her to question whether she had become involved in something far more controlling than she had initially realized. Together, we explore the blurred lines between faith, community, and control, offering an honest look at how these dynamics can shape \u2014 and sometimes manipulate \u2014 personal beliefs. Whether you\u2019re familiar with the ICOC or simply curious about the complexities of faith-based organizations, this episode provides valuable insights into Jocelyn\u2019s lived experiences and offers a unique perspective on what it means to be part of a religious group that some might label a cult.

We\u2019ll discuss the painful realization that the church\u2019s promise that \u0027anyone could lead\u0027 was a lie\u2014a promise reserved only for those who fit a rigid mold.

We\u2019ll also explore the cult-like manipulation tactics used within the ICOC, the rigid gender roles imposed on men, and the mental health challenges that arose from trying to conform to unrealistic expectations.

Today, we dive deep into a compelling and often heartbreaking topic with our episode titled \u0022We Were In a Cult?\u0022 In this episode, we explore a story that spans five decades with our guest, Kathi, who began her journey in the 14th Street Church\u2014later known as the Crossroads Church of Christ, the genesis of the ICOC. Kathi was baptized at an early age, but as she got older, she felt the pressure to be baptized again\u2014something many members faced as the church\u0027s expectations evolved. In the beginning, Kathi found the church to be an amazing community that she truly loved. It was a place of belonging and spiritual growth. But as time went on, the cracks started to show. Kathi opens up about how the church\u0027s culture of control became stifling, where simply asking questions was viewed as an act of rebellion. She shares the pain of being labeled and ostracized by church leaders, and the heartbreak of seeing her own children turned against her. After leaving the ICOC for 10 years, Kathi returned\u2014this time to the ICC. However, to her dismay, she saw the same issues that plagued the ICOC resurfacing in the ICC as well. In this episode, we delve into the difficult emotions of witnessing the church\u0027s changes over the years and confronting the same problems in a new environment. Join us for an eye-opening conversation about faith, control, and resilience as Kathi shares her powerful and deeply personal story.

Today, we dive deep into a compelling and often heartbreaking topic with our episode titled \u0022We Were In a Cult?\u0022 Our guest today is Joabis, who stands out as the first member of the International Churches of Christ (ICOC) to join us while still being an active member of the church. Joabis\u0027s journey is truly international\u2014born in Africa, he moved to India where he was introduced to the ICOC and quickly ascended into leadership In our conversation, we delve into some deeply personal and challenging topics. Joabis shares his experience with arranged marriages within the church, including his own at a young age. As he poignantly put it, \u0022I got married for the ministry and left for the ministry.\u0022 We explore the struggles he faced to maintain both his marriage and his leadership position, and ultimately, how he made the difficult decision to step down from leadership in order to save himself and his marriage. What struck me most about Joabis is his unwavering positivity, his capacity for forgiveness, and his hopeful outlook on life and its endless possibilities. His story is a powerful testament to resilience and the human spirit, and I believe you\u0027ll find his perspective both enlightening and inspiring.

Today, we dive deep into a compelling and often heartbreaking topic with our episode titled \u0022We Were In a Cult?\u0022 Our guest this week is a brave former member of the International Churches of Christ (ICOC) Justine who grew up under our church\u0027s stringent control.\nIn this episode, we explore the profound impact of living in an environment where conformity was not just encouraged but enforced. Our guest shares her personal journey, revealing how the church\u0027s oppressive standards dictated her appearance and personality, going so far as to demand she re-dye her pink hair before her baptism to appear \u0022godly.\u0022\nMore than just a spiritual authority, the church acted as a surrogate parent, often overshadowing the influence and guidance of her actual parents. This dynamic further intensified the pressure to conform and exacerbated the struggles she faced as she navigated her identity.\nThis discussion sheds light on the severe consequences of such control, including her struggles with mental health and anorexia. Join us as we uncover the emotional and psychological toll of her life in the ICOC and her courageous path to healing and self-acceptance.\nTune in and be inspired by this powerful story of resilience and the quest for true identity and freedom.\nJustine is actively involved in the lawsuits against the ICOC and the ICC, supporting survivors in writing their plaintiff statements. She has also co-founded a nonprofit with Chele Roland called Free2B, which helps survivors of spiritual abuse find the resources they need to process their experiences in high-control groups. If you are a victim, you can reach out to Justine or Chele through the Free2B website: www.free2b.org.\nIf you are a member, were a member, or know someone who was a member of the ICOC or the ICC and would like to share your story of your life in and out of the church and help us maybe get closer to answering the question \u0022we were in a cult?\u0022, and maybe find some healing please contact me via email at clemenzwithaz@gmail.com or you can DM via Instagram at the \u0022Clemenz With a \u0022Z\u0022 podcast\u0022 Instagram page.\u00A0\nAs always, thank you for your continued support and if you like what you hear please rate and review!\u00A0 If you don\u0027t remember, I\u0027m just a channel, I ain\u0027t the source.\nIf you would like to support the podcast financially please follow this link: https://gofund.me/7ebb0524\nPeace!",

Our conversation centered mostly on what it was like as a \u0022kingdom kid\u0022 in the church and how much our view of reality and life was through the lens of the church and it\u0027s teaching. Some of the big topics were the feeling of guilt after baptism and continually trying to earn it, and how as you grew up in the church you learn little by little that you cannot trust yourself. I know that I can relate to that a lot. I am grateful to have had this conversation and you all should check this out!

That institution also has a damaging power once it is that institution drops them or turns it back on them. If you are a member, were a member, or know someone who was a member of the ICOC or the ICC and would like to share your story of your life in and out of the church and help us maybe get closer to answering the question \u0022we were in a cult?\u0022, and maybe find some healing please contact me via email at clemenzwithaz@gmail.com or you can DM via Instagram at the \u0022Clemenz With a \u0022Z\u0022 podcast\u0022 Instagram page.

We were also able to speak more about the teen ministry, feeling eyes on us all the time, the purity culture in the teens, and the way girls were treated here. The biggest take away for me was that it is important to only have a sandwich at lunch and not a sandwich, chips and a pickle.

We talked about her life in the church and out of the church but more importantly, she shared the abuse she dealt with most of her life by the hands of a member of the church. She currently has a case filed against the church because of it. The conversation was a powerful one and dealt heavily with abuse she endured. I am humbled that she allowed me to share her story and my hope is her story brings healing and justice for all in situations like hers.
