      "description": "Hey everyone - hope you\u0027re all doing well! It\u0027s a research week for me again this week, which means I\u0027m busy preparing the next block of videos I\u0027m about to share with you all. But like I said before, instead of missing an upload I\u0027ve put together a compilation of previous videos so at least I still have something to share with you guys!\n\nAnd don\u2019t worry, these will never replace my normal uploads, you\u2019ll still be getting exactly the same number of new uploads as you normally do throughout the year!! It just means I\u2019ll have something to upload whenever I take a week off for research, so this way a video every week is guaranteed \uD83D\uDE0A\n\nHope you enjoy the rest of your weekend!\n\nOriginal videos included in this episode:\n- Video 1 - Ant Hill Kids - https://youtu.be/3wBXOkcvhDg\n- Video 2 - Anne Hamilton Byrne \u0026 \u2018The Family\u2019 - https://youtu.be/vzvvApT-ofU\n- Video 3 - The Workers Institute Cult - https://youtu.be/c02mHrb66TU\n\n\n**PRODUCTS USED**\nDetails of makeup products can be found in descriptions of original videos above.",
