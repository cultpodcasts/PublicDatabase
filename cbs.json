      "description": "\u201CI represent divine principle, total equality, a society where people own all things in common, where there\u2019s no rich or poor, where there are no races. Wherever there are people struggling for justice and righteousness, there I am.\u201D-Jim Jones, founder, Peoples TempleIn Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple, award-winning filmmakers Stanley Nelson, Marcia Smith, and Noland Walker reveal the true, tragic story behind enigmatic preacher Jim Jones and his promise of a world of economic and racial equality that ultimately led to the largest mass murder-suicide in history. This documentary tells the story of the people who joined Peoples Temple, following Jones from Indiana to California and ultimately to their deaths in Guyana in November 1978. Jonestown was an official selection of numerous 2006 film festivals, including Tribeca, Silverdocs, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.Hailed as \u201Csurreal and heartbreaking\u201D (The Village Voice) and \u201Cchilling\u201D (San Francisco Chronicle), the 90-minute American Experience film features first-hand recollections of former Peoples Temple members, including some who narrowly escaped death in those frantic, final days in the South American jungle; relatives of those who died; and candid interviews with Jones\u2019s son, Jim Jones, Jr. \u201CWe wanted the story to be told in the voices of the people who lived through it,\u201D explains Nelson. \u201COf the five people who survived, there are \u2014 to my knowledge \u2014 three left alive. Two of them are in the film.\u201DJonestown also includes never-before-seen footage shot inside Peoples Temple, providing a rare glimpse of Jones\u2019s passionate preaching and emotional healing services.Nelson was drawn to making this film by a persistent question: What drove thousands of people to join Peoples Temple? \u201CThey saw themselves changing the world, with the church as a tool,\u201D he says, noting that Jones offered prospective members jobs, homes, and a sense of common purpose \u2014 striving to create a just world.\u201CI did allow Jones to think for me because I figured that he had the better plan,\u201D says former Peoples Temple member Hue Fortson, whose wife and infant son were among the more than 900 who died in Guyana after drinking cyanide-laced fruit punch. \u201CI gave my rights up to him. As many others did.\u201DIn an audiotape that was recovered from the disaster site, Jones declares, \u201CWe committed an act of revolutionary suicide protesting the conditions of an inhumane world.\u201DBut was it suicide \u2014 or murder? \u201CIt\u2019s impossible to say exactly what went on that day,\u201D says Nelson. \u201CBut it is very clear that the kids \u2014 something like 250 people who were under eighteen \u2013 were all murdered.\u201D Stanley Clayton, one of the few who escaped alive, clearly states his opinion in the film: \u201CThat man was killin\u2019 us.\u201D",
