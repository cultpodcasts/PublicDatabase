Aimee mixed religion with Hollywood-level showmanship to amass a global following and bring evangelicalism to the forefront. A lone female preacher in a sea of men, she founded America\u0027s first megachurch and became a pioneer televangelist. But what did it take to build a following of that scale? And who helped her get there? The answers will reveal a complicated history about the fight to put faith back in American politics *Starts June 16th, 2025 Hosted on Acast.
