I hope to elevate my channel very soon by editing my videos, adding engaging thumbnails, a better setup (getting out of my car), and more, but I\u0027m just not there yet. I share this to say that I stumbled over my words in a few areas or what I was trying to say didn\u0027t come out exactly like I wanted it to, but overall I\u0027m pleased with the content. (And if I re-recorded, I\u0027d probably messed up in a different area)\n\nPlease understand that I greatly appreciate the views, subscribers, comments, and feedback.

      "title": "Trigger Warning A Sneak Peak from my Play --- (JW) Sisters Living with Religious Trauma/Syndrome",
      "description": "Trigger Warning \nSensitive Content \n\nYes!!!!\n\nI absolutely did write the Worldwide Headquarters of Jehovah\u0027s Witness in Walkhill, NY, in a desperate effort to save my marriage. \n\nSee, like so many of us who are abused by our JW husbands, we don\u0027t really want a divorce. We want them to stop. STOP hurting us! However, many of us can\u0027t get help, and that gives us no choice but to leave and divorce in many situations if we want to live. Then, we are disciplined or, in some cases, disfellowshipped for choosing safety.  \n\nThe WORST part about all of this for me was watching my youngest child lose her faith, so I have had to learn to have a lot of patience and to give her as much autonomy as reasonably possible while she heals from her own religious trauma.\n\nAs far as drama therapy and working with my amazing acting coach, I have so much work to do on this piece. I am so emotional, and you can\u0027t hear everything I\u0027m saying clearly. The hardest part is when I say, \u0022What about my baby girl? She doesn\u0027t believe God answers prayers, and she doesn\u0027t want me to pray with her, and I don\u0027t know what to do. Why NY?\u0022\n\nNow, when I perform this for my Midwest Tour next summer, I\u0027ll have to deliver this from my diaphragm, and to prepare, I am working on diaphragm exercises. \n\nAlso, I am in the chair way too long. My acting coach and I are working on this. Should I stand up at one point and kick the chair back? Do I walk over to the other side and deliver lines? We\u0027ll figure it out! \n\nSo, would you like to see my play? Would you like to be a sponsor for my play? How about joining my group coaching program this December?

      "description": "So, does drama therapy cure trauma?\n\nThis is the question that I am researching as a capstone project for my studies at IWU for my Bachelor of Science in Psychology. To accomplish this, I will be performing my very own one-woman stage play, Let Mia Tell It, based on my 2018 self-published book. Afterward, I will teach a trauma-informed workshop entitled, \u0022What\u0027s Hurting You?\u0022 \n\nThe workshop will use the themes from the play as lessons to teach the audience about adverse childhood experiences, generational curses, emotional abuse, spiritual abuse, domestic violence, and more. \n\nOnce I graduate, I\u0027ll continue on my journey toward becoming an amazing, skilled drama therapist. \n\nCheck out my play and workshop! Audience participation is very much appreciated, and this play is for individuals 18 years and older only! My journey is full of adult content and possible triggering content, so beware. Other than that, I hope to see you! Dates will be released soon! \n\nDoes drama therapy cure trauma? \n\nwww.amazon.com/author/miracassidy\nhttps://youtu.be/q5d2WwSrJgA",

      "description": "https://www.gofundme.com/f/miras-muscular-dystrophy\n\nThis fundraiser was created to help an exceptional, caring, African American disabled female in need. This female is intentionally unnamed.  I want to present her with a monetary gift to help her continue to fight a disease that has left her wheelchair-bound for the majority of her life, muscular dystrophy. \n\nMuscular dystrophy is a degenerative illness that begins in childhood. Life expectancy used to last until the teens but some individuals are now living much longer, like my cousin, the retired educator who this fundraiser is for. \n\nShe has a brilliant mind and has accomplished so much. She is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Incorporated, holds two bachelor\u0027s degrees, and two master\u0027s degrees. She has helped dozens and dozens of students and individuals through the years, including me!\n\nShe gave me hope when I didn\u0027t have any and encouraged me to thrive no matter what tribulations I may face. I love her and her mother very much!\n\nCreating this fundraiser has not been easy and I hope to get your support. Please watch the corresponding YouTube video that explains more, and please give what you can. No amount is too little! If you are unable to give then please share the YouTube video.\n\nWhy have I hidden the name of who this fundraiser is for? Though this wonderful woman is aware of my vision and has given me her blessing. She does not wish to be shown and I completely respect her wishes. Also, I am passionate about this topic and if I say something that another does not agree with then it is completely on me. \n\nFollow Mira Cassidy on social media for more information, videos, and content.\n\nThis fundraiser will run from February 15-March 1.\n\nThank you so much for your support!\n\nMuch Love,\n\nMira Cassidy\n\n\u0022Greeting family and friends. As you all know my mom has been my primary caregiver for my whole 50 years of life, and a superb one if I may say so myself! As we all age things are getting a little more difficult for the both of us. Due to me being courageous, earning a degree and working for 13 years as a special ed teacher, in Indiana I am not eligible for any services. Yeah, yeah, I know it doesn\u0027t make sense to anyone. However, my cousin has dedicated many hours trying to find a way to help us. Currently, she is hosting a fundraiser in our honor to assist us with caregiver expenses which are excessively High and outside of our regular monthly expenses. You all know that we are private and prideful but we don\u0027t want to block her blessing as well as our own. Please View and reshare the attached video. If you are moved to assist, we thank you and love you. If you are not, we thank you and love you.
