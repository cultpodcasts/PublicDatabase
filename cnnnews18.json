      "description": "The mystery surrounding Jeffrey Epstein deepens as the family of Virginia Giuffre\u2014one of Epstein\u2019s most prominent sex-trafficking accusers\u2014demands the immediate release of all Epstein files. Speaking to CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins, Giuffre\u2019s family says that Virginia wanted the truth to come out and that sealed documents continue to protect powerful individuals connected to Epstein\u2019s global network.\n\nGiuffre\u2019s brother makes an emotional appeal, stating that she was \u201Cnot an object,\u201D but someone who was \u201Cstolen\u201D and \u201Cpreyed upon.\u201D While Epstein died in jail in 2019 before facing trial, questions around his associates, flight logs, sealed testimonies, and elite connections remain unanswered.\n\nThe renewed calls for transparency have once again brought attention to Epstein\u2019s past links with influential figures, including former US President Donald Trump and his Mar-a-Lago association. While Trump has denied any wrongdoing and no criminal charges have been proven, the family insists the focus should remain on truth, accountability, and justice for survivors.\n\nAs pressure mounts globally, the key question remains: If there is nothing to hide, why are the Epstein files still sealed?\nWatch this report for the latest updates, context, and global reactions. \n\n#EpsteinFiles #VirginiaGiuffre #JeffreyEpstein #Trump #GlobalNews \nn18oc_world\nn18oc_live \nNews18 Mobile App - https://onelink.to/desc-youtube",
