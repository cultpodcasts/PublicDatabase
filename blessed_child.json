We start off talking about the the labor trafficking program disguised as a \u0022providential course\u0022 or right of passage, known as \u0022special task force\u0022 and what that really means. The story then travels headlong into Moon\u0027s mansion - East Garden in Tarrytown New York, where an 18 year old Karin is thrust into a 3 day matching and marriage.

Teddy Hose grew up in the Tarrytown community just north of the city, near the Moon family in the 80s and 90s, before his family moved to Seattle when he was a teen. Teddy was a 2nd generation leader in Seattle in high school, then went on to do STF and attend the University of Bridgeport for 2 years, before transferring to the School of Visual Arts in NYC. He now creates social media videos for television networks career-wise, and his own art on the side, currently music.

      "description": "This week I was able to revisit with Yoshika Wason, who is an educator and writer, as well as a 2nd generation born and raised ex-member of the Unification Church. We explore a plethora of stories and intersections between our two perspectives of growing up moonie in the city of Bridgeport Connecticut. We discuss the settlement era of the Unification church and what that looked like from a child\u0027s perspective. We also talk about Poetry, Wonhwado, navigating school systems in a corrupt system, escaping the cycle of income inequality, labor trafficking of 1st generation Unification Church members, and so much more. Bridgeport Ct has one of the highest crime rates in the United States and Bridgeport is ranked as 2nd in the US as greatest city with income inequality. Please keep in mind that many Unification Church members are working for trade services, with no actual paystubs, health care, retirement, insurance or social security. (Labor trafficking, financial abuse, debt bondage,) Also keep in mind that during this \u0022Settlement era\u0022 there is immense pressure to support the church and donate/tithe unjustifiable amounts to the church and affiliated organizations. When a survivor tells their story, reach out and let them know they have been heard.

Tune in to this 20\u0026#43; year BHS reunion call, where we talk about many sensitive topics, from labor trafficking, death on stf, child abandonment and institutional kidnapping. We speak frankly about the concept of offering children in the unification church, destructive belief systems tied to purity culture, and recovering from a authoritarian high control group. Please listen with caution! For historical context Sunmyung Moon was nearly 40 years old, when he coerced a 17 year old Annie Choi to have sex with him. ( child sex trafficking/rape) After years of grooming and taking her family money, he impregnated her and then took her child and smuggled the newborn into another family, effectively hiding his affair, infidelity and pedophilia. Sam Park, the illegitimate son of Sunmyung Moon was possibly the first offering child, in 1966, raised by Bohi Pak.
