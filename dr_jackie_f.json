In this video I share from my book \u0022Multiple Personality One Woman\u0027s Journey from Discovery to Recovery\u0022 Part Three, Ritual Abuse, Where do I go from here.\nI share several memories from the cult abuse, starting with the first memory which was triggered by a simple family event. Ritual/ Cult abuse is the most difficult memories to experience. They are bazaar, unbelievable, and designed to be so. They create doubt, fear, and disbelief. \nYou can work through them, don\u0027t give up, there is a light at the end of the tunnel.

      "description": "Dissociative identity disorder (DID) AKA multiple personality disorder (MPD), is a controversial disorder. This is a real disorder, and is curable. The journey is hard especially when dealing with the memories,  but it is worth it. There are false ideas of what DID is or isn\u0027t. My goal is to be a positive voice for this serious disorder. In this session I will share some of the communications that took place while working with and through the reality of living with dissociative identity disorder. \nCommunications within the DID system is very important to integration. Without communications you can not understand what the different personalities need and how to learn about each one.",

Her personal story takes you from the first memory of abuse to discovering of her first alter (altered personality); a young girl of 5 years old. The strangeness of this disorder is one of the reasons some healthcare professionals do not believe the validity of DID. The journey is difficult, but worth the journey for the positive results of integration that comes at the end.\n\n#multiplepersonalitydisorder, #DID, #DissociativeidentityDisorder, #DIDAwarness, #TraumaRecovery, #Multiplicity, #Healingjourney, #youarenotalone, #memories, #integration \n\nBooks\nMultiple Personality, One Woman\u2019s Journey From Discovery to Recovery \nhttps://a.co/d/5XU8F6j \nDaily Journal of a Multiple: Companion to Multiple Personality, \nhttps://a.co/d/eprYAGE",
