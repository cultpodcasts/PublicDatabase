In this fourth installment, she opens up about earlier journal entries that reveal her struggles with disconnect and the search for her true self\u2014long before her DID diagnosis. Through these journals, Dr. Jackie reflects on the process of discovering who she is, shedding light on the complexities of living with DID. The unusual nature of this disorder often leads some healthcare professionals to question its validity. Despite the challenges, Dr. Jackie highlights how the journey, though difficult, ultimately leads to the powerful and healing process of integration.\n\n#multiplepersonalitydisorder, #DID, #DissociativeidentityDisorder, #DIDAwarness, #TraumaRecovery, #Multiplicity, #Healingjourney, #youarenotalone, #memories, #integration \n\nBooks\nMultiple Personality, One Woman\u2019s Journey From Discovery to Recovery \nhttps://a.co/d/5XU8F6j \nDaily Journal of a Multiple: Companion to Multiple Personality, \nhttps://a.co/d/eprYAGE",

The journey is hard especially when dealing with the memories,  but it is worth it. There are false ideas of what DID is or isn\u0027t. My goal is to be a positive voice for this serious disorder. In this session I will share some of the communications that took place while working with and through the reality of living with dissociative identity disorder. \nCommunications within the DID system is very important to integration. Without communications you can not understand what the different personalities need and how to learn about each one.",
