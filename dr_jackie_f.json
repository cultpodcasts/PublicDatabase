      "description": "Cult and ritual abuse is one of the worse memories to experience. In this video I share from my book \u0022Multiple Personality One Woman\u0027s Journey from Discovery to Recovery\u0022 Part Three, Ritual Abuse, Where do I go from here.\nI share several memories from the cult abuse, starting with the first memory which was triggered by a simple family event. Ritual/ Cult abuse is the most difficult memories to experience. They are bazaar, unbelievable, and designed to be so. They create doubt, fear, and disbelief. \nYou can work through them, don\u0027t give up, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Trust yourself and trust the alter\u0027s memories. \n\n#cult/ritual abuse, #memoriesrevived #memory \n#multiplepersonalitydisorder, #DID, #DissociativeidentityDisorder, #DIDAwarness, #TraumaRecovery, #Multiplicity, #Healingjourney, #youarenotalone, #memories, #integration \n\nBooks\nMultiple Personality, One Woman\u2019s Journey From Discovery to Recovery \nhttps://a.co/d/5XU8F6j \nDaily Journal of a Multiple: Companion to Multiple Personality, \nhttps://a.co/d/eprYAGE",
