      "description": "Claire spent the first 36 years of her life in two different strict religious movements. Although both based on Catholicism, the latter group was a bit more sinister. The leader of that group was jailed for pedophilia after abusing his power by molesting teenage girls.\n\nAfter challenging the leaders\u2019 authority through a series of letters, Claire and her family were evicted from the latter group. For the first time in her life Claire was free, albeit with 8 children in tow. She tells us her incredible story of survival and freedom.",
