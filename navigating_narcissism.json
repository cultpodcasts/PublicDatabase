Sarah realizes that Keith Raniere, Nancy Salzman, and NXIVM were abusing many of its female members. For the first time, Sarah sees the horrible truth about the organization, and how Keith was actually sexually abusing women behind closed doors. When Sarah was tricked into joining DOS, more insidious events unfold all around NXIVM, which lead to Sarah taking action to protect herself and the women around her. Listen to how Sarah\u0027s whistleblowing finally started the beginning of the end of NXIVM.

      "description": "Sarah Edmondson was a young actress pursuing a career in film and television, when she hit a low point and was hoping to find a new purpose in life. She ran into renowned filmmaker, Mark Vicente, who spoke to her about NXIVM and eventually brought her into the organization. There she started following Keith Raniere and Nancy Salzman\u0027s mission. They encouraged Sarah to give her all. In part 1 of 2, we learn about how NXIVM\u0027s leadership undermined its followers and groomed them in such a conniving way, that no one knew what was happening to them. Sarah grew close to many members of the organization - which later turned out to be a cult, and even rose up in leadership. Listen to how Sarah\u0027s journey and newfound community helped her find a new meaning in life.

      "description": "As we dive into part 2 of Mark Vicente\u0027s experience in the NXIVM cult, we go even deeper and discuss the root of the problem, Keith Raniere and executive team, who aided and abetted his actions of abuse. Mark talks about victim blaming, and points out that what happened to him could really happen to anyone. Mark breaks down his emotional journey after finding out and then accepting the truth about Raniere\u0027s abuse. With the justice system being flawed, we witness the rare occasion where the abuser receives a deserving sentence.

Taking his first photograph at age four, he quickly discovered his passion for being behind the camera. After attending film and drama school in South Africa, he began working his way up the ranks of the camera department. His first big break came as Director of Photography on the musical SARAFINA, starring Whoopi Goldberg. In 1992, he relocated to Los Angeles to shoot his first studio picture for Disney; FATHERHOOD, starring Patrick Swayze and Halle Berry. Over the next few decades, he went on to shoot an additional 14 feature films and numerous documentaries, music videos and commercials. Mark soon discovered untold stories he needed to express as a director. He was driven by the conviction that tales of greatness, nobility and introspection could be exciting and financially successful. Growing up during the Apartheid era in South Africa and its widespread iniquities, Mark learned early on to question fundamental assumptions and beliefs about human behavior, cosmology, existentialism, and mysticism. While that bold curiosity served him well, the path found him in direct contact with truly malignant pathologic personalities masquerading as forward-thinking philosophical leaders teaching self-improvement while inflicting unthinkable damage to their followers... and to Mark himself. His recent defection from the NXIVM cult was chronicled in the HBO series THE VOW. Mark and a few courageous whistleblowers exposed the criminal activities of this organization, resulting in multiple arrests and indictments. Mark is currently in production on a number of films including one on Narcissism and Narcissistic abuse. #NavigatingNarcissism I want to hear from you, too.\u00A0 Have a toxic topic you want me to explore?
