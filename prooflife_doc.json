      "description": "This video delves into the disturbing case of Tiffany Adams, a grandmother allegedly involved in a murder plot and connected to an anti-government religious group in Oklahoma known as \u0022God\u0027s Misfits.\u0022 We\u0027ll explore the details of the crime, Adams\u0027 alleged role, the custody battle that may have been a motive, and the shocking beliefs of the cult-like group she was reportedly a part of. Join us as we unpack the chilling events that led to a double homicide investigation and the arrests of Adams and her associates.\n\nThe only reason I narrated myself was even though I\u0027m shitty at reading everyone seems to be sick of the A.I crap.\n\n\nInfluenced and inspired by all of the awesome crime channels on Youtube.@EWUCrimeStorytime  @story @mytruecrimenews @CaseFilesTV @CourtTV",
