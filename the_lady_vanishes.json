We also examine the how the police investigation is at odds with Sally Leydon\u2019s belief that her mother was taken \u2013 either by a person, a group or some other foreign influence. From the moment she was reported missing the police determined Marion had simply decided to walk away from her children, her friends, her career and her possessions.
