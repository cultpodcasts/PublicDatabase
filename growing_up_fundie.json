In this sneak peek of Episode 1: Adam Hinkle is a Chicago-based actor and filmmaker. He grew up on the east coast, primarily in the Philadelphia suburbs and attended college in Pittsburgh, PA, but relocated to Chicago in 2007 to pursue theatre and film. Since then, he has appeared Off-Broadway and with various storefront theatre companies in Chicago, with a focus on television and film within the past several years. He made his directing debut with \u0027The Park,\u2019 a dramatic web series chronicling the trials and tribulations of a fictional group of outreach workers urgently trying to prevent gun and gang violence in a Chicago neighborhood. This project took five years to complete and had a successful festival run, garnering several awards in the process. He also made his television debut on \u0027Chicago Fire,\u2019 and his feature film debut in the horror-slasher \u0022Haunt Season\u0027 that was released this past October. https://adam-hinkle.com/ theparkwebseries.com @arhinkle (IG, Threads, TikTok, Twitter, YouTube) @arhinkle.bsky.social (Bluesky) @adamrhinkle (Facebook) https://mickeyosullivan.com/ Support the show",

What did it offer? What were its practices? Who joined and why? What does it tell us about spirituality and culture in America?\n\n\u201CWhat makes a cult different from a religion or a sect, and why the word cult so often produces revulsion or compulsion.

In this episode, Lindsey tells us, in detail, her experience being one of the chosen \u201CGothard Girls,\u201D and how spending time with Bill Gothard one-on-one shaped her young mind, and lead her to the crusade she now leads to spread awareness of his terrible legacy, and destroy the facade of \u201Cgoodness\u201D and \u201Choliness\u201D he managed to create.

Throughout this time, Danny was raised to believe that things like bad math skills, and being bullied at church camp, could only be resolved through prayer. After a tumultuous childhood involving accusations of demonic possession, food being withheld as punishment, and other symptoms of a high-control environment, Danny realized that figuring out who he was outside of religion and control depended on him, and seeking help from outside sources to unravel his past, and pave the way for his future. https://www.meetup.com/pro/recovering-from-religion (This has virtual, and in person support groups.) recoveringfromreligion.org Phone Support: US and Canada - 844-368-2848 (84-I-DOUBT-IT) UK - \u0026#43;20 3856 8791 Australia - \u0026#43;3 4505 2402 South Africa - \u0026#43;27 11 043 5323 The Secular Therapy Project: seculartherapy.org (The gold mine) RFR Resources: RecoveringFromReligion.org/Resources _______________________________________ Find this episode, and others here: Website: www.growingupfundiepodcast.com Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/2EHJGf8kGbSV9SRbqsfYKS Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/growing-up-fundie/id1602008078 Amazon Music: https://music.amazon.com/podcasts/ad6ac91e-c2fb-47d6-8658-df8aed941eac/growing-up-fundie Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/sydneydavisjrjr Buzzsprout Subscriptions: https://www.buzzsprout.com/https://www.buzzsprout.com/1908164/supporters/new1908164/supporters/new Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5QuI5etVfbJoTVAhbRGMkA Discord: https://discord.gg/XQNG4nD5 Our Subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/GrowingUpFundie/ More about the host, Sydney Davis Jr. Jr. sydneydavisjrjr.com Think you might make a great guest, or know someone who would be?

Despite his devout upbringing, and attending church multiple times each week, he began to see the cracks in the lessons being taught by the church, vs the choices they were showing him through their actions. After specific events that caused even his parents to finally leave their congregation, he realized he not only didn\u2019t want to go to church anymore, but he wasn\u2019t even sure he believed in the teachings of the bible.

In fact, he was quite the opposite! However, as a young religious pre-teen, Hunter found himself looking for a place of worship that he felt was more serious, and less of the concerts he felt modern Non Denominational churches had become. In this episode, Hunter shares with us how he went from considering life in a monestary, to being an active and outspoken atheist on platforms all across the internet. _______________________________________________________________ Find this episode, and others here: Website: www.growingupfundiepodcast.com Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/2EHJGf8kGbSV9SRbqsfYKS Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/growing-up-fundie/id1602008078 Amazon Music: https://music.amazon.com/podcasts/ad6ac91e-c2fb-47d6-8658-df8aed941eac/growing-up-fundie Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/sydneydavisjrjr Buzzsprout Subscriptions: https://www.buzzsprout.com/https://www.buzzsprout.com/1908164/supporters/new1908164/supporters/new Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5QuI5etVfbJoTVAhbRGMkA Discord: https://discord.gg/XQNG4nD5 Our Subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/GrowingUpFundie/ More about the host, Sydney Davis Jr. Jr. sydneydavisjrjr.com Think you might make a great guest, or know someone who would be?

In her book \u0022Permission Granted, Take the Bible into Your Own Hands,\u0022 she encourages people of faith to explore the texts on their own, freed from long-held myths and misconceptions; experience the Bible anew; and appreciate this holy book for what it is, not what we think it should be. Dr. Bird has taught in New Jersey, Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina, Oregon and Virginia. Her varied background within: the United Methodist Church, education in a Presbyterian affiliated institution, time spent in several ministerial contexts, six years of graduate work in biblical studies, and more than 20 years of teaching in classrooms of all kinds inform her approach to having quite honest, and sometimes difficult, conversations about what is actually to be found in the scriptures of the Christian Bible.

      "description": "Aaron Yost identifies as a member of the Reformed faith, who often align themselves with Calvinistic beliefs. According to Encyclopedia Brittannica: (The Reform Church) sees the Bible as the only source of truth, and they accept two sacraments\u2014baptism and Communion, or the Lord\u0027s Supper. Along with other Protestants the Reformed churches also believe that people are saved by having faith in God, not because of anything they do. The Reformed churches also believe in predestination. Predestination is the idea that God decided before you were even born whether or not you were going to heaven, or going to hell. In this episode, Aaron shares his thoughts on God, his faith, his predestined future, and what it means to accept the sovereignty of God. Aaron is a member of the Conversation Coalition, a team of four Christians and Four Atheists who have live (and free-to-attend) discussions over important and often polarizing topics related to faith and the Bible.

Through the lens of a person who knows they can\u0027t undo the past, and can only move forward from here, Nathan shares his story on personal growth, and how he\u0027s accepted his past as a learning lesson that he can use to brighten his future. _______________________________________________________________ Find this episode, and others here: Website: www.growingupfundiepodcast.com Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/2EHJGf8kGbSV9SRbqsfYKS Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/growing-up-fundie/id1602008078 Amazon Music: https://music.amazon.com/podcasts/ad6ac91e-c2fb-47d6-8658-df8aed941eac/growing-up-fundie Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/sydneydavisjrjr Buzzsprout Subscriptions: https://www.buzzsprout.com/https://www.buzzsprout.com/1908164/supporters/new1908164/supporters/new Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5QuI5etVfbJoTVAhbRGMkA Discord: https://discord.gg/XQNG4nD5 Our Subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/GrowingUpFundie/ More about the host, Sydney Davis Jr. Jr. sydneydavisjrjr.com Think you might make a great guest, or know someone who would be?

In June of 2023, I interviewed Graham about his past, having been a devoted member of leadership in his Evangelical faith. After spending decades of his life leading worship services, hosting bible studies, and even attending a conservative Presbyterian seminary after college, Graham began to recognize thoughts and feelings within himself that he eventually couldn\u2019t ignore. (Check out his previous interview on Episode 115 ) Now, Graham returns to tell us what has happened in the 6 months since we last spoke with him, and how different his life and personal relationships have changed in the interim.

On Growing Up Fundie, she\u2019s been given her chance! Natalie takes over as host for the evening as she is joined by a panel composed of Scot (from multiple prior episodes) and GUF newcomers Hannah, and Jessie. These three panelists are current and former members of leadership within their churches who volunteered their time and experiences to help us get some of the answers Natalie seeks. As she poses questions, they provide their thoughts and opinions, as well as scripture and other resources that they feel best represents the points they are trying to make.

In Episode 115, Graham takes us on his complicated journey of discovering himself, along with the ramifications that might come hand-in-hand with his discoveries. **NOTE FROM SYDNEY: Graham is also the most patient human being on this planet. We originally recorded his episode in July of 2023. However, I am a butthead and, due to a series of ridiculously-timed circumstances, took forever to get his episode posted. Thank you, Graham, for being so cool about it, and not putting a pox on my household.** Email: graham.buck@gmail.com Instagram: @grahamhbuck Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/grahambuck _______________________________________________________________ Find this episode, and others here: Website: www.growingupfundiepodcast.com Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/2EHJGf8kGbSV9SRbqsfYKS Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/growing-up-fundie/id1602008078 Amazon Music: https://music.amazon.com/podcasts/ad6ac91e-c2fb-47d6-8658-df8aed941eac/growing-up-fundie Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/sydneydavisjrjr Buzzsprout Subscriptions: https://www.buzzsprout.com/1908164/supporters/new Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5QuI5etVfbJoTVAhbRGMkA Discord: https://discord.gg/XQNG4nD5 Our Subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/GrowingUpFundie/ More about the host, Sydney Davis Jr. Jr. sydneydavisjrjr.com Think you might make a great guest, or know someone who would be?

      "description": "On Growing Up Fundie, Ep. 114: Tim Mills of @HarmonicAtheist doesn\u0027t skirt around my tougher questions, and delivers his thoughts in his signature, straightforward manner. Father of four, Tim Mills, placed his faith in Jesus, and church ministry from a young age. As a child, he took pride in memorizing thousands of Bible verses, and listening to the sermons of famous Evangelical pastors on the radio with his parents. After being homeschooled throughout his youth, Tim attended the now-infamous Bob Jones University (in SC) and Lancaster Bible College (in PA) for his undergrad. He also attended New Tribes Mission Institute (currently Ethnos 360), for one year, to prepare for a career in tribal evangelism and church planting. After getting sidelined by severe insomnia, Tim shifted to \u0022secular\u0022 work, including being a customer cabinetmaker, a stock broker, a fraud analyst, and a social media manager, before transitioning this year to being a full-time YouTuber. He began his deconstruction journey in 2016, and had fully deconverted by the Fall of 2019. Through his YouTube channel,\u0022Harmonic Atheist,\u0022 Tim posts content in an effort to help his audience remove themselves from mythology-based worldviews, heal from religious trauma, and empower themselves to share their own personal stories.

That being said, Rodney didn\u0027t always feel that way. In the beginning, he was a young teen trying to find his purpose in this world, whose first introduction to his \u0022purpose\u0022 was through the evangelical church. Join me for episode 113, where Rodney shares his amazing journey from bible college, to a YouTube channel in search of the truth. ______________________________________ Find this episode, and others here: Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/2EHJGf8kGbSV9SRbqsfYKS Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/growing-up-fundie/id1602008078 Amazon Music: https://music.amazon.com/podcasts/ad6ac91e-c2fb-47d6-8658-df8aed941eac/growing-up-fundie Support us on Buzzsprout Subscriptions: https://www.buzzsprout.com/1908164/supporters/new Support us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/sydneydavisjrjr Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5QuI5etVfbJoTVAhbRGMkA Discord: https://discord.gg/XQNG4nD5 Join us on Reddit on r/GrowingUpFundie: https://www.reddit.com/r/GrowingUpFundie/ More about the host, Sydney Davis Jr. Jr. sydneydavisjrjr.com Think you might make a great guest, or know someone who would be?

Drew was raised within the Evangelical Christian church by formerly-Catholic parents who gravitated towards the conservative ideas encouraged by the Southern Baptist Convention, and the churches that associate with it. From a young age, Drew began to question many of the messages he was receiving from the pulpit, as well as the lack of diversity in the congregations he was often involved in. Through a combination of personal curiosity, his love of research, and his introduction to higher education, Drew has now learned to question everything, pursue the truth, and welcome the changes that he anticipates he\u2019ll experience as he learns and grows into the person he was meant to be.

He soon realized through his medical studies that so much of what he was being told in church didn\u2019t line up with what he was learning in school.

When her youngest child was a teenager, he confronted her with a simple fact she couldn\u2019t ignore. In that moment, her life took a drastic turn, and she\u2019s never looked back since. GG has quickly become one of my favorite people to talk to, and having the chance to hear her amazing, powerful, shocking, tragic, and hope-giving story in her own words was a gift.

They also couldn\u2019t stay with our birds until they were confirmed healthy, so they had to live in the office that day. Now they have a flight cage and will NEVER INTERRUPT ANOTHER INTERVIEW AGAIN I SWEAR. (although if you like them they also appear on my interview with Neil the 604 Atheist).
