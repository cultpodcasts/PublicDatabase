Cheers! https://forms.gle/g48Bn8Nzd1P8ymBs5 Watch the visual version of this episode here: https://youtu.be/FrRgKx1vaGg Danny B. was enrolled in Christian school until the 1st grade, after which he became homeschooled all the way through high school. Throughout this time, Danny was raised to believe that things like bad math skills, and being bullied at church camp, could only be resolved through prayer. After a tumultuous childhood involving accusations of demonic possession, food being withheld as punishment, and other symptoms of a high-control environment, Danny realized that figuring out who he was outside of religion and control depended on him, and seeking help from outside sources to unravel his past, and pave the way for his future. https://www.meetup.com/pro/recovering-from-religion (This has virtual, and in person support groups.) recoveringfromreligion.org Phone Support: US and Canada - 844-368-2848 (84-I-DOUBT-IT) UK - \u0026#43;20 3856 8791 Australia - \u0026#43;3 4505 2402 South Africa - \u0026#43;27 11 043 5323 The Secular Therapy Project: seculartherapy.org (The gold mine) RFR Resources: RecoveringFromReligion.org/Resources _______________________________________ Find this episode, and others here: Website: www.growingupfundiepodcast.com Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/2EHJGf8kGbSV9SRbqsfYKS Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/growing-up-fundie/id1602008078 Amazon Music: https://music.amazon.com/podcasts/ad6ac91e-c2fb-47d6-8658-df8aed941eac/growing-up-fundie Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/sydneydavisjrjr Buzzsprout Subscriptions: https://www.buzzsprout.com/https://www.buzzsprout.com/1908164/supporters/new1908164/supporters/new Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5QuI5etVfbJoTVAhbRGMkA Discord: https://discord.gg/XQNG4nD5 Our Subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/GrowingUpFundie/ More about the host, Sydney Davis Jr. Jr. sydneydavisjrjr.com Think you might make a great guest, or know someone who would be?

After years of involving himself in the ministry, Kyle began to recognize that he wasn\u2019t sure he truly agreed with everything he was helping preach, or even believed it himself. Now an \u201Cagnostic who still sometimes struggles with the idea of an afterlife,\u201D Kyle shares his thoughts and feelings on coming to your own conclusions, trusting your gut, and questioning everything you\u2019re told.

Despite his devout upbringing, and attending church multiple times each week, he began to see the cracks in the lessons being taught by the church, vs the choices they were showing him through their actions. After specific events that caused even his parents to finally leave their congregation, he realized he not only didn\u2019t want to go to church anymore, but he wasn\u2019t even sure he believed in the teachings of the bible.

He walked the walk and talked the talk. But forcing his faith didn\u2019t work for him, and he was soon miserable. At 33 years old, he finally called it quits.

In fact, he was quite the opposite! However, as a young religious pre-teen, Hunter found himself looking for a place of worship that he felt was more serious, and less of the concerts he felt modern Non Denominational churches had become. In this episode, Hunter shares with us how he went from considering life in a monestary, to being an active and outspoken atheist on platforms all across the internet. _______________________________________________________________ Find this episode, and others here: Website: www.growingupfundiepodcast.com Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/2EHJGf8kGbSV9SRbqsfYKS Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/growing-up-fundie/id1602008078 Amazon Music: https://music.amazon.com/podcasts/ad6ac91e-c2fb-47d6-8658-df8aed941eac/growing-up-fundie Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/sydneydavisjrjr Buzzsprout Subscriptions: https://www.buzzsprout.com/https://www.buzzsprout.com/1908164/supporters/new1908164/supporters/new Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5QuI5etVfbJoTVAhbRGMkA Discord: https://discord.gg/XQNG4nD5 Our Subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/GrowingUpFundie/ More about the host, Sydney Davis Jr. Jr. sydneydavisjrjr.com Think you might make a great guest, or know someone who would be?

In her book \u0022Permission Granted, Take the Bible into Your Own Hands,\u0022 she encourages people of faith to explore the texts on their own, freed from long-held myths and misconceptions; experience the Bible anew; and appreciate this holy book for what it is, not what we think it should be. Dr. Bird has taught in New Jersey, Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina, Oregon and Virginia. Her varied background within: the United Methodist Church, education in a Presbyterian affiliated institution, time spent in several ministerial contexts, six years of graduate work in biblical studies, and more than 20 years of teaching in classrooms of all kinds inform her approach to having quite honest, and sometimes difficult, conversations about what is actually to be found in the scriptures of the Christian Bible.

      "description": "Aaron Yost identifies as a member of the Reformed faith, who often align themselves with Calvinistic beliefs. According to Encyclopedia Brittannica: (The Reform Church) sees the Bible as the only source of truth, and they accept two sacraments\u2014baptism and Communion, or the Lord\u0027s Supper. Along with other Protestants the Reformed churches also believe that people are saved by having faith in God, not because of anything they do. The Reformed churches also believe in predestination. Predestination is the idea that God decided before you were even born whether or not you were going to heaven, or going to hell. In this episode, Aaron shares his thoughts on God, his faith, his predestined future, and what it means to accept the sovereignty of God. Aaron is a member of the Conversation Coalition, a team of four Christians and Four Atheists who have live (and free-to-attend) discussions over important and often polarizing topics related to faith and the Bible. Find out more about the Conversation Coalition on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and (if you live in Tennessee) in person! https://www.facebook.com/theconversationcoalition Instagram: @conconashville _______________________________________________________________ Find this episode, and others here: Website: www.growingupfundiepodcast.com Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/2EHJGf8kGbSV9SRbqsfYKS Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/growing-up-fundie/id1602008078 Amazon Music: https://music.amazon.com/podcasts/ad6ac91e-c2fb-47d6-8658-df8aed941eac/growing-up-fundie Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/sydneydavisjrjr Buzzsprout Subscriptions: https://www.buzzsprout.com/https://www.buzzsprout.com/1908164/supporters/new1908164/supporters/new Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5QuI5etVfbJoTVAhbRGMkA Discord: https://discord.gg/XQNG4nD5 Our Subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/GrowingUpFundie/ Think you might make a great guest, or know someone who would be?

In their story, Ring tells us about \u201Ccounseling\u201D exorcisms, and the thoughts that lead them to becoming the person they are today.

On Growing Up Fundie, she\u2019s been given her chance! Natalie takes over as host for the evening as she is joined by a panel composed of Scot (from multiple prior episodes) and GUF newcomers Hannah, and Jessie.

As she poses questions, they provide their thoughts and opinions, as well as scripture and other resources that they feel best represents the points they are trying to make.

      "description": "Playwright (and long time friend) Chase Wheaton-Werle spent three years researching just who, exactly, the famed \u0027Three Wise Men\u0027 from the Nativity story were. Why do we not see them again in the Bible? What was their interest in the birth of the infant Jesus? How do we use them as such common Nativity Christmas decorations, without even knowing their names, or their origin stories? Through his deep-dive into the identity of these men, Chase wrote his new stage comedy \u0022Wise Guys,\u0022 debuting at The Factory Theater in Chicago. Check out Chase\u0027s episode on all platforms, and then check out his play via the ticket links below.

With such a wide variety of belief systems being introduced to him as the one \u201Ctrue\u201D religion, Tobin eventually found himself questioning the validity of all of them. Through his journey in self-discovery, his live music career, and his life-changing experiences in secular therapy, Tobin has since dedicated his life to proving to other people that you don\u2019t need a religion to tell you who you are, or what you\u2019re worth. Check out his delightful interview on Episode 116 of Growing Up Fundie, and then give his channel a listen to help us determine what genre of music his is considered.

      "description": "Graham Buck once devoted his career aspirations to being a member of leadership in his Evangelical faith. After spending decades of his life leading worship services, hosting bible studies, and even attending a conservative Presbyterian seminary after college, Graham began to recognize thoughts and feelings within himself that he eventually couldn\u2019t ignore. With a resume, marriage, and professional resume all founded upon his devout faith, he had to face the possibility that his years of devotion to God might not be a path he was meant to continue following. In Episode 115, Graham takes us on his complicated journey of discovering himself, along with the ramifications that might come hand-in-hand with his discoveries. **NOTE FROM SYDNEY: Graham is also the most patient human being on this planet. We originally recorded his episode in July of 2023. However, I am a butthead and, due to a series of ridiculously-timed circumstances, took forever to get his episode posted. Thank you, Graham, for being so cool about it, and not putting a pox on my household.** Email: graham.buck@gmail.com Instagram: @grahamhbuck Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/grahambuck _______________________________________________________________ Find this episode, and others here: Website: www.growingupfundiepodcast.com Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/2EHJGf8kGbSV9SRbqsfYKS Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/growing-up-fundie/id1602008078 Amazon Music: https://music.amazon.com/podcasts/ad6ac91e-c2fb-47d6-8658-df8aed941eac/growing-up-fundie Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/sydneydavisjrjr Buzzsprout Subscriptions: https://www.buzzsprout.com/1908164/supporters/new Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5QuI5etVfbJoTVAhbRGMkA Discord: https://discord.gg/XQNG4nD5 Our Subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/GrowingUpFundie/ More about the host, Sydney Davis Jr. Jr. sydneydavisjrjr.com Think you might make a great guest, or know someone who would be?

      "description": "On Growing Up Fundie, Ep. 114: Tim Mills of @HarmonicAtheist doesn\u0027t skirt around my tougher questions, and delivers his thoughts in his signature, straightforward manner. Father of four, Tim Mills, placed his faith in Jesus, and church ministry from a young age. As a child, he took pride in memorizing thousands of Bible verses, and listening to the sermons of famous Evangelical pastors on the radio with his parents. After being homeschooled throughout his youth, Tim attended the now-infamous Bob Jones University (in SC) and Lancaster Bible College (in PA) for his undergrad. He also attended New Tribes Mission Institute (currently Ethnos 360), for one year, to prepare for a career in tribal evangelism and church planting. After getting sidelined by severe insomnia, Tim shifted to \u0022secular\u0022 work, including being a customer cabinetmaker, a stock broker, a fraud analyst, and a social media manager, before transitioning this year to being a full-time YouTuber. He began his deconstruction journey in 2016, and had fully deconverted by the Fall of 2019. Through his YouTube channel,\u0022Harmonic Atheist,\u0022 Tim posts content in an effort to help his audience remove themselves from mythology-based worldviews, heal from religious trauma, and empower themselves to share their own personal stories.

Drew was raised within the Evangelical Christian church by formerly-Catholic parents who gravitated towards the conservative ideas encouraged by the Southern Baptist Convention, and the churches that associate with it. From a young age, Drew began to question many of the messages he was receiving from the pulpit, as well as the lack of diversity in the congregations he was often involved in. Through a combination of personal curiosity, his love of research, and his introduction to higher education, Drew has now learned to question everything, pursue the truth, and welcome the changes that he anticipates he\u2019ll experience as he learns and grows into the person he was meant to be.

He soon realized through his medical studies that so much of what he was being told in church didn\u2019t line up with what he was learning in school.

What message/information (if any) has God provided? What the heck does God want from me? For the next ten years, she began researching, questioning, and digging, before coming to the conclusion that, \u201Din many cases, the Christian religion not only fails to prioritize personal relationship with God (though some claim to), but they also do not equip believers to find it.\u201D In this episode, Natalie wants to share the tools she realized she needed in order to equip herself with the personal relationship with God that she now experiences every day.

They also couldn\u2019t stay with our birds until they were confirmed healthy, so they had to live in the office that day.
