      "description": "From the RT\u00C9 Prime Time blog, by Rita O\u0027Reilly: \n\nScientology has tried to make it big in Ireland before, but now it\u2019s back with a multi-million euro investment in three new facilities \u2013 one around the corner from Government Buildings in Dublin\u2019s Merrion Square, another in the suburb of Firhouse, and a third, through its affiliated Narconon group, in Ballivor, County Meath.\n\nIt\u2019s an expensive return, but it\u2019s not been a popular one, and indeed, it\u2019s been marked by controversy.\n\nWhat is it about Scientology? After all, it is tiny. Though it claims a membership of millions worldwide, the available evidence suggests tens of thousands. Here in Ireland, in the last census, just 87 people said they were Scientologists. The comparator often used is, \u2018Well, how many people claim to be Jedi knights?\u2019, and in Ireland\u2019s census, there were 2,000.\n\nYet, its tiny membership has not deterred Scientology. It has said its investment has been funded by donors abroad. Its return is a big effort \u2013 aside from the new facilities, its spend is on outreach, with free events, Google and mobile ads, Promoted tweets, mailshots, booklets, and leaflets through your door \u2013 all material printed at its own distribution works in Los Angeles.\n\nWhy Ireland? Well, contrary to reports, we\u2019re nothing special. Since the start of last year, Scientology has opened over a dozen new buildings worldwide.\n\nThey follow a formula it keeps repeating: its leader, David Miscavige and committed members fly in to the openings, which are staged events. Videos of those launches are then shown at annual internal gala events, where donor members are dazzled with special Scientology statistics promoting its claim of rapid expansion. Scientology calls additions like Firhouse, \u2018Ideal Organisations\u2019, and it says that Mr Miscavige \u201Cpersonally supervises the selection of each new Ideal Org\u201D.\n\nThe weekend after its Firhouse centre opened in October 2017, Scientology launched another building in Birmingham, and the weekend after that, in Amsterdam: three weekends in a row \u2013 all staged openings, off-limits to the general public.\n\nThe organisation already has a Brussels office and its European headquarters is in Copenhagen.\n\nJournalist Tony Ortega, editor of the \u2018The Underground Bunker\u2019, has reported on Scientology for over two decades. He points out: \u201CThe new Ideal Org in Dublin is not a new European centre or headquarters, it has nothing to do with Brexit and it has nothing to do with taxes. The Church of Scientology is already tax exempt in the United States, it pays no taxes; it is not looking for new tax shelters.\u201D\n\nBut its office in Merrion Square, opened in 2015, is one of only a few \u2018National Affairs\u2019 offices it has. \u201CThese are moves that reflect what David Miscavige has done in the United States\u201D, Mr Ortega says. \u201CSeveral years ago, Miscavige refurbished a building in Washington DC for a new \u2018national affairs office\u2019. It was a new sort of idea for Scientology \u2013 they then extended that to Ireland. And why Merrion Square? Well, because it means a lot to Scientologists, that location, because L Ron Hubbard himself had worked out of Merrion Square back in the 1950\u2019s.\u201D\n\nIt was at the end of 1955, and Scientology\u2019s creator, L Ron Hubbard was already a controversial figure. He had been refused a visa renewal to the UK, where he had a base, and he had temporarily moved to Ireland to what he called \u201Cthe swankiest address in Dublin\u201D, Merrion Square.\n\nOn 17 April 1956, while he was still based there, the Director of the FBI, J Edgar Hoover, noted that in divorce proceedings, Hubbard\u2019s second wife, Sara Northrup, had described him as \u201Chopelessly insane\u201D. \u201CHis recent letters have been unanswered inasmuch as he is considered obviously a mental case\u201D, Mr Hoover wrote.\n\nAt the time, (20 April 1956) L Ron Hubbard was writing to his followers that his Merrion Square office was a \u201CBritish fallback point in the event of atomic attack\u201D.\n\nHis stay was short lived: he left within months. His organisation, Scientology, however, set up in Ireland from the 1980\u2019s.\n\nMike Garde of Dialogue Ireland has followed its arrival, decline and return since then. He says that though it is small, its impact can be devastating.\n\n\u201CI\u2019ve been dealing with the families of people from Malin Head to Mizen Head in this country who have been affected by this Scientology organisation\u201D, Mike Garde says, \u201Cbreakup of marriages, breakup of families \u2013 of one guy, he became addicted completely to alcohol, they tore him apart\u201D.\n\nIt is that concern and concerns like it that led to tonight\u2019s Prime Time: \u2018Scientology \u2013 The Return\u2019.\n\nhttps://www.rte.ie/eile/2018/1218/1017981-scientology-the-return/",

My colleague, Deputy Peadar T\u00F3ib\u00EDn, who is a local representative, has pointed out that there is no provision in legislation for the regulation or inspection of residential treatment or rehabilitation centres specialising in addiction. Will the Taoiseach tell us whether he shares the concerns that have been raised about this? Is there a way to support local people and allay their concerns?\u0022\n\nTaoiseach Leo Varadkar: \u0022I certainly want to join others in acknowledging the worries and legitimate concerns of people in Ballivor in County Meath at the proposed opening of a Narconon centre there. This is, nonetheless, a free country which guarantees free association to people and citizens, so I am not sure whether the Government can do anything if it has planning permission for the centre. Certainly, if people are there by free will and their own decision and they are not been detained against their will, it is difficult to know what actions the Government can take. I will certainly speak to my public representatives in the area to see whether there is a way forward.\u0022",

      "description": "Residents of Ballivor have sent a clear message to Meath County Council, the HSE and Government that they will not tolerate the Church of Scientology and Narconon locating a drugs rehabilitation centre in their village.\n\nOver 140 people turned out for the protest which was spearheaded by Cllr Noel French and Claire O\u0027Meara of the Ballivor Says No campaign.\n\nThe scene of the protest was the former national school which was sold by the parish some years back.\n\nIn June 2016, the former primary school in Ballivor came on the market with CBRE, with a half-built nursing home development on the site.\n\nThe school building was refurbished and extended to accommodate a modern 15-bedroom nursing home, while on an adjoining 2.26-acre site, some foundations have been laid for a 41-bedroom extension. CBRE was asking \u20AC1 million for the \u2018Raspberry Wood Nursing Home\u2019 site. The agents are understood to have sold it to another agent, acting for a client.\n\nIn August of 2016 it\u0027s understood the Narconon Trust applied to Meath County Council seeking a declaration that the site would be exempt from a change in planning. This was confirmed by the Council.\n\nCllr Noel French said he was heartened by the turnout for the protest. \u0022The people of Ballivor don\u0027t want this here. We have petitions out in shops, we need our TDs, our councillors, our senators, our ministers and our Toiseach to support this campaign.\u0022\n\nDeputy Shane Cassells said the village of Ballivor needed support and investment and not a facility from \u0022such a shady organisation\u0022.\n\n\u0022I\u0027ve raised this issue on the floor of the Dail with the Taoiseach asking him if this is the type of facility he wants to see operating and the Taoiseach came back and said he certainly didn\u0027t want to see any medical facility operate where there were no suitably qualified people and I\u0027ll be holding the Taoiseach to his word on that so that we don\u0027t have a Narconon drugs rehabilitation centre operating in Ballivor\u0022.\n\nClaire O\u0027Meara of Ballivor Says No group said that the village was completely unsuitable for locating such a facility and she said the campaign to see the project stopped would continue.",

      "description": "Martin Padfield was a Scientologist for 28 years, after meeting a member of the group when he was just 19 years old. He joined the elite corps at the heart of Scientology, as his whole life became dominated by the teachings and strictures of the movement. But after he married, he started to question the way he and his new family were treated. He began to doubt the organisation\u0027s integrity, and embarked on a journey that forced him to confront the reality that his whole identity was defined by Scientology.\n\nMartin tells Dominic Lawson how hard it was to extricate himself from what many consider to be a powerful cult, and how tough the journey has been to rediscover an identity lost from the point in his youth when he threw himself into the unusual world of L Ron Hubbard and his disciples.\n\nIn \u0022Why I Changed My Mind\u0022, Dominic Lawson interviews people who have changed their mind on controversial matters.",

      "description": "Scientology ar RT\u00C9 Raidi\u00F3 na Gaeltachta le R\u00F3n\u00E1n Mac Aodha Bhu\u00ED\n\nR: Now, there\u0027s a lot of talk about the Church of Scientology at the moment - there\u0027s a new documentary film made by Louis Theroux about them, there\u0027s a ban on showing the film in Ireland; there\u0027s a new office open in Merrion Square in Dublin, which has drawn a lot of attention and talk; there\u0027s always talk about the big stars - the likes of Tom Cruise, John Travolta and people like that - who are or who were connected to Scientology. We have a man on now who knows a lot about them - Eamonn, welcome to the show.\n\nE: Thank you Ronan, how are you?\n\nR: Great, now, you don\u0027t want me to give out your surname on the show today, so I\u0027ll just call you Eamonn. You\u0027re part of the protests and demonstrations against the Church of Scientology, the Scientologists - why?\n\nE: Yeah, I started going to the protests a few years ago. I heard and I\u0027d been reading on the internet about all of the abuses done by the Church - they intimidate critics of the Church, they separate people from their families, taking money from people - so I started going to the protests and I met people who had been part of the Church previously and they had experience of these abuses, so that\u0027s the reason.\n\nR: Can I ask you, why were you not happy to give your surname or those kind of details on the show today, to RnaG?\n\nE: Yeah, well because the Church has a history of intimidating people who criticise them in the news. I\u0027ve met people who someone from the Church spoke to their employer, saying they were a bad person, that they had done things against the law. And as well as that they often sue people who criticise them, they follow people. They have a long history of doing these things, so I don\u0027t want them to have this information.\n\nR: Tell me about the Church of Scientology and their history, where do they come from - can you give us a bit of background please Eamonn?\n\nE: They started in America in the fifties. L. Ron Hubbard founded the Church. He was a science fiction writer and he came up with a pseudo-psychological system called Dianetics and he started selling this system to people. He then formed sort of a religion out of this called Scientology and more people started coming to it. There are some famous people associated with the Church now, such as Tom Cruise and John Travolta, so they had a larger profile. They have an office in Ireland, they\u0027ve had a Church on Abbey Street for quite a while now. I don\u0027t think there are that many members in Ireland - I think they say they have more than they do. As well as that, they\u0027ve just opened a big new office on Merrion Square.\n\nR: What is there to this religion. What do they believe?\n\nE: The thing is - it\u0027s kind of part of the system. You go in and do these so-called \u0027personality tests\u0027 in the Church and you go in and do this test for free. They go in on the things that are wrong with you, that you\u0027re not happy with and then they sell you courses for the things that they find. The thing is, the beliefs, they don\u0027t tell them to you until you\u0027re at a higher level in the Church. The beliefs that they have are that everyone on Earth came from a different planet millennia ago and that we have souls in the bodies that we have and that there is a galactic overlord called Xenu that wants to put everyone on the wrong path. The belief system is there but they don\u0027t tell it to the public until you\u0027re at this higher level.\n\nR: But maybe we did all come from a different planet thousands of years ago...\n\nE: That\u0027s ok, if they have those beliefs, I don\u0027t have a problem with that. But the system around this, that you have to pay an awful lot of money to have your soul be free and at a higher level in the Church. There is a lot of secretism around it and the system around it isn\u0027t right at all.\n\nR: So a lot of people are part of this system. What kind of strategy do they have? How do they entice people in? You mentioned this test they do on your personality.\n\nE: Exactly, they do a personality test on you and they find out you have a problem with your family, you have a problem with money - oh, we have a course for that. Then, the first course might be free, and then they do what they call \u0027auditing\u0027 - you go into a room, you have to answer strange questions, they repeat things to you, it\u0027s a kind of hypnosis. Then at the end they say they have another course for you. This one might cost more money and if you don\u0027t have the money, you might have to work for them, enticing more people into the Church.\n\nR: So they find out what the problems are in your life and then they try to get a benefit for you from that.\n\nE: Yes, but the methods, they don\u0027t have any scientific basis. They\u0027re thrown together from different things - they say they\u0027re kind of an alternative to psychology - according to them, psychology is evil and only they have the right answers.\n\n[Continues]",

      "description": "Across the country, donors and high-ranking executives say that the aggressive fundraising and construction scheme is used to enrich the central church at the expense of the rank and file, helping to grow the Scientology war chest to over a billion dollars. Two former members, Mike Rinder and Mark Elliott, went so far as to call the project a \u201Creal estate scam.\u201D To some of these defectors, the structures are metaphors for the religion itself: garish on the outside, empty on the inside. The irony is that the very expansion that Scientology lauds as its renaissance is actually a symbol of internal dissent and decline.\n\nAccording to ex-executives, the Ideal Org money play is simple: Find beautiful buildings; get local parishioners to foot the bill; keep them closed; keep fundraising; open them; and finally, have the parishioners pay for renovations, buy supplies, and send money to the central church for the right to practice there. http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexklein/is-scientology-self-destructing",
