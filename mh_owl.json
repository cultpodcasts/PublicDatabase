      "description": "On July 18, 2025, RCMP officers executed a sudden operation at the abandoned school housing Queen Romana Didulo\u2019s so-called \u0022Kingdom of Canada\u0022 in Richmound, Saskatchewan. The raid followed suspicions of unauthorized water use, potential infrastructure damage, and growing concern from municipal authorities. One man, believed to be Ricky Lee Manz, was detained. Community TV was on the scene moments later to document the fallout\u2014including confrontations with irate neighbours.\n\nThis may be the beginning of the end for the cult\u2019s grip on this small prairie village.\n\nWATCH THE FULL STORY UNFOLD.\n\nHashtags:\n#RomanaDidulo #RCMP #Richmound #SovereignCitizens #WaterTheft #CultNews #GonzoJournalism #QueenOfCon #CommunityTV #SaskatchewanNews #FreedomFraud #MedBedMadness\n\nhttp://www.comtv.ca\r\nMedicine Hat\u0027s local web-based broadcaster!",
