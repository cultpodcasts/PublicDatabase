      "description": "In the late 1970s, at a remote desert location near LaQuinta, California, L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, made a significant decision to start his very own movie studio. This venture aimed to create Scientology training films, which were intended to educate and inform members of the church about its teachings and practices. To bring this vision to life, he enlisted his inexperienced Sea Organization staff, who lacked the film production skills typically needed for such an ambitious project. The staff became the target of Hubbard\u0027s wrath and abuse when they didn\u0027t perform to his liking. In this video, Janis Gillham Grady and Stuart Moreau tell  the fascinating story of the beginnings of what later evolved into Golden Era Studios. \n\nPurchase new \u0022Connection\u0022 Merchandise here at this link -\nhttps://our-scientology-stories-p-shop.fourthwall.com/\n\nRemember to Subscribe to our Channel - \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCHOFqZ2gPwwZgnPB6aUJQ\n\nPlease subscribe to Mark\u0027s new Channel - Las Vegas, Travel and More -\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYm2YEKqbO2Kz0Fn4nkUmuw\n\nTo purchase Merch for this channel including KOALA CALM, Joint Formula, Autographed books, shirts, coffee mugs etc,  click the Store button on our page, or go to our website - https://our-scientology-stories-p-shop.fourthwall.com/ \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCHOFqZ2gPwwZgnPB6aUJQ/join\n\nBuy us a Cup of Coffee - Donations are greatly appreciated -\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/messengeroi",

      "description": "In 1987, Scientology issued a policy that Sea Organization members could no longer get pregnant and have children if they wanted to stay in the Sea Organization.  This created a big problem for some people who found out they were pregnant right after the policy was issued.  \n\nDan Locke and his wife faced this situation.   If they had the child, one of them would be kicked out of the Sea Organization and made to work at an outer Scientology Organization away from their spouse.  Not only that, the child would be subjected  to the neglect, abuse and lack of education, while growing up under Sceintology\u0027s care.  They decided to stay.\n\nDan shares his story in detail on this video.   He and his wife at the time, were eventually kicked out and disgarded by Scientology 15 years later, along with their 15 year old son, to start their lives over.\n\nWatch this video for the rest of the details and story.    \n\nRemember to Subscribe to our Channel - \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCHOFqZ2gPwwZgnPB6aUJQ\n\nPlease subscribe to Mark\u0027s new Channel - Las Vegas, Travel and More -\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYm2YEKqbO2Kz0Fn4nkUmuw\n\nTo purchase Merch for this channel including KOALA CALM, Joint Formula, Autographed books, shirts, coffee mugs etc,  click the Store button on our page, or go to our website - https://our-scientology-stories-p-shop.fourthwall.com/ \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCHOFqZ2gPwwZgnPB6aUJQ/join\n\nBuy us a Cup of Coffee - Donations are greatly appreciated -\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/messengeroi",

      "description": "Mark Fisher and Janis Gillham Grady are joined by Sandy Holeman to discuss who was David Mayo and what happened to the Advanced Ability Center that Mayo set up with other former Scientology senior executives and technical personnel to deliver counseling in competition to Scientology in the mid 1980s.\n\nDavid Mayo was the Senior Case Supervisor International for Scientology, after years of training and interning with L. Ron Hubbard.   He was a Class 12 Senior Case Supervisor and was called upon to audit L. Ron Hubbard in the late 1970s when Hubbard was seriously ill and possibly could have died.\n\nHubbard turned against Mayo in the early 1980s, based on false reports by David Miscavige, resulting in Mayo being removed from his position, kicked out of Scientology and declared a Suppressive Person, along with many other senior Scientology executives.\n\nMayo then set up an outside group \u2013 the Advanced Ability Center (AAC) \u2013 with several other former executives and technical personnel (near Santa Barbara, California) to deliver counseling in competition with Scientology at greatly reduced pricing.\n\nThe Advanced Ability Center was then targeted heavily by Scientology and the Religious Technology Center for fair gaming and destruction.  The group was  infiltrated  by spies and the cult took legal actions against the AAC and Mayo himself.  The Advanced Ability Center eventually went out of business.\n\nSandy Holeman and her husband at the time, Roger Barnes, worked at the AAC during part of this time.  Sandy tells the story of what happened.\nWe hope you find this video informative.\n\nRemember to Subscribe to our Page -\n@MarkFisherandJanisGillhamGrady\n\nBuy us a Cup of Coffee - Donations are greatly appreciated -\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/messengeroi\n\nPlease subscribe to Mark\u0027s new Page - Las Vegas, Travel and More -\n@mfisherlv\n\nTo purchase Merch for this channel including KOALA CALM, shirts, coffee mugs etc,  click the Store button on our page, or go to our website - https://our-scientology-stories-p-shop.fourthwall.com/ \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCHOFqZ2gPwwZgnPB6aUJQ/join",

A legendary figure to some people, who was responsible for correcting the highest trained Scientology Counselors (Class 12s) in the world.\n\nAfter leaving the cult in the early 80s, he eventually became one of the first people on the internet in the 90\u0027s, speaking out about Scientology Technology and Policy, quoting from these policies in on-line debates.  Scientology tried to stop all discussion of their confidential policies and materials on the internet.\n\nSo in 1995,  Scientology got a court to order his home raided by Scientology agents (along with Law Enforcement), ransaking his home and taking his computer hard drives, along with other items and materials.\n\nDennis and his attorneys fought for years against Scientology over this attack on free speech and eventually all of us can now speak out freely on the internet about Scientology abuses.\n\nDennis now helps others recover from time in Scientology and other cults.\nIn this video we discuss with him how the technology and policies of Scientology entrap people from the moment they come in for help. \n\nRemember to Subscribe to our Page -\n@MarkFisherandJanisGillhamGrady\n\nPlease subscribe to Mark\u0027s new Page - Las Vegas, Travel and More -\n@mfisherlv\n\nTo purchase Merch for this channel including KOALA CALM, shirts, coffee mugs etc,  click the Store button on our page, or go to our website - https://our-scientology-stories-p-shop.fourthwall.com/ \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCHOFqZ2gPwwZgnPB6aUJQ/join\n\nBuy us a Cup of Coffee - Donations are greatly appreciated -\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/messengeroi",

      "description": "Phil Jones and his wife Willy have been protesting for many years against the Scientology abuse of Disconnection.   Both their son and daughter are still in the Scientology cult and after Phil and Willy left years ago, their children stopped talking to them.  It is the policy of Disconnection.\n\nRather than doing nothing, Phil raised the funds to put up billboards in Los Angelas and Clearwater, Florida asking for their loved ones to call them.   Scientology fought them with harrassment and dirty tricks.   The billboards eventually came down.\n\nNow Phil is back, with a new BIllboard that is posted outside the Scientology Big Blue Complex with a phone number that people trapped in Scientology and the Sea Organization can call for help.\n\nMark Fisher and Janis Gillham Grady did an interview with Phil Jones in July 2023 as part of a longer video regarding disconnection.   This is the complete interview with Phil Jones where he tells his story.\n\nWe hope you find it informative.\n\nRemember to Subscribe to our Page -\n@MarkFisherandJanisGillhamGrady\n\nPlease subscribe to Mark\u0027s new Page - Las Vegas, Travel and More -\n@mfisherlv\n\nTo purchase Merch for this channel including shirts, coffee mugs etc,  click the Store button on our page, or go to our website - https://our-scientology-stories-p-shop.fourthwall.com/ \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCHOFqZ2gPwwZgnPB6aUJQ/join\n\nBuy us a Cup of Coffee - Donations are greatly appreciated -\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/messengeroi",

John got involved in Scientology in the late 1960s as a teenager through his family up in Toronto, Canada.    He was recruited into the Sea Organization and sent to the Flagship Apollo at age 18 to work with L. Ron Hubbard.\n\nJohn recounts stories about life on the Apollo, working with Hubbard and witnessing Hubbard\u0027s abuses.   \n\nHe also tell the story of the coup d\u0027etat in Morocco against the King of Morocco while the Flagship Apollo and Hubbard were in the country trying to establish good relations with the Government.   Scientology decided to help the King locate those invoved with the coup by using Scientology Security Checking techniques (interogations) and John McLean was assigned the duty of getting the Scientology auditors together to do this.\n\nThe results did not turn out well and resulted in John deciding to leave the ship and the Sea Organization.  A fascinating story.\n\nJohn is the son of Nan McLean, who became an outspoken critic of Scientology in Canada in the early 70\u0027s.   We will cover those stories in our next interview with John McLean.\n\nWe hope you enjoy this interesting video.\n\nRemember to Subscribe to our Page -\n@MarkFisherandJanisGillhamGrady\n\nPlease subscribe to Mark\u0027s new Page - Las Vegas, Travel and More -\n@mfisherlv\n\nTo purchase Merch for this channel including shirts, coffee mugs etc,  click the Store button on our page, or go to our website - https://our-scientology-stories-p-shop.fourthwall.com/ \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCHOFqZ2gPwwZgnPB6aUJQ/join\n\nBuy us a Cup of Coffee - Donations are greatly appreciated -\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/messengeroi",

      "description": "Scott and Karry Campbell join Mark Fisher and Janis Gillham Grady to tell their horrifying story of abuse on the Scientology Sea Organization ship Freewinds.\n\nScott and Karry Campbell were 2 of the first people assigned to the Freewinds when the ship was first purchased and were trusted crew members who lived on the ship for several years.\n\nPunishments increased on the ship in the early 1990s and Scientology Public were being made to donate large sums of money to the International Association of Scientologists when Scott began to speak out and report what was going on.\n\nHis Grandmother was on her death bed and his family was calling for him to come see her before she passed away.   Scott requested a short leave and it was denied.   \n\nNot wanting to disappoint his large family, Scott left the Freewinds Ship and went into town to get a plane ticket to see his Grandmother and then come back to the ship.  Instead, Scientology Security captured him in town and physically put him in a vehicle, taking him back to the ship.\n\nThat began months of being locked up in a room on the Freewinds.  His food and drinks were drugged with Chloralhydrate and he was physically restricted to the room by his security guards for wanting to leave his captivity.   He was having a mental breakdown.\n\nMeanwhile, his wife Karry was left to wonder what was going on, was told her husband was having a psychotic incident and was not allowed to see him.\n\nAfter months of captivity on the ship, he was finally transported to the Scientology headquarters in Los Angelas with Karry where his captivity continued until they were finally let go and sent to Karry\u0027s Family home in California.  \n\nHowever, that wasn\u0027t the end of the story.....\n\nThis is part 1 of this story of abuse.  Part 2 will be released in a few days.\n\nRemember to Subscribe to our Page -\n@MarkFisherandJanisGillhamGrady\n\nPlease subscribe to Mark\u0027s new Page - Las Vegas, Travel and More -\n@mfisherlv\n\nTo purchase Merch for this channel including shirts, coffee mugs etc,  click the Store button on our page, or go to our website - https://our-scientology-stories-p-shop.fourthwall.com/ \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCHOFqZ2gPwwZgnPB6aUJQ/join\n\nBuy us a Cup of Coffee - Donations are greatly appreciated -\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/messengeroi",

There are lots of never before seen photos included.\n\nThis is Part 2 of the story.\n\nIn this video, you will hear about how Robbie Levin left the Sea Organization, began a very successful business career and eventually left Scientology altogether.

They found out about Scientology and joined in 1968.   Robbie and his band were there with Yvonne at the very beginnings of Celebrity Centre  in Los Angeles and eventually they joined the Sea Organization while continuing to tour and perform as a rock band.  They eventually left the Sea Organization and Scientology.  \n\nYou will also hear Robbie\u0027s story about how he left Scientology, got a  repayment of his money still on his account and then went to the Clearwater Sun Newspaper to tell his story once he had left.\n\nThe documentary film Brothers Broken about the lives of Robbie and his brother Geoff Levin is touring the country right now.  \n\nRemember to Subscribe to our Page -\n@MarkFisherandJanisGillhamGrady\n\nPlease subscribe to Mark\u0027s new Page - Las Vegas, Travel and More -\n@mfisherlv\n\nTo purchase Merch for this channel including shirts, coffee mugs etc,  click the Store button on our page, or go to our website - https://our-scientology-stories-p-shop.fourthwall.com/ \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCHOFqZ2gPwwZgnPB6aUJQ/join\n\nBuy us a Cup of Coffee - Donations are greatly appreciated -\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/messengeroi",

She suffered both physical and mental abuse at the hands of L. Ron Hubbard and others on the ship.    Danielle wasn\u0027t a Messenger  for Hubbard but instead worked in the ships galley and other areas doing manual labor without any adult looking after her.\n\nAssigned to the Rehabilitation Project Force as a child and then later locked in the dark, dirty, dangerous chain locker for days as a punishment.  She finally left the ship and went back to England.\n\nYou will hear about L. Ron Hubbard\u0027s days in Rhodesia (Zimbabwe)  where he was eventually thrown out of the country by the government.\n\nYou will also hear about Danielle\u0027s life after leaving the Apollo and working in Scientology for several years before finally leaving.\n\nDanielle is a loyal supporter and member of our channel.\n\nTo purchase Merch for this channel including shirts, coffee mugs etc,  click the Store button on our page, or go to our website -\nhttps://our-scientology-stories-p-shop.fourthwall.com/\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCHOFqZ2gPwwZgnPB6aUJQ/join",
