      "description": "L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology had a BIG problem in the early 1970s when they operated in the Mediterranean and Caribbean on their Flagship Apollo.  They needed to hide their identity due to fear of government officials and law enforcement.  The Apollo Stars and dancers were created to hide that identity with local port officials through free concerts and events.   Neil Sarfati is back with more stories about the Apollo Stars and how it became an avenue for Sea Org Members to get out of the Sea Org prison program - the Rehabilitation Project Force.\n\nPurchase Janis Gillham Grady\u0027s OUTBACK NATURAL - Complete Liquid Multivitamins as well as other Merchandise here at this link -\nhttps://our-scientology-stories-p-shop.fourthwall.com/\n\nRemember to Subscribe to our Channel - \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCHOFqZ2gPwwZgnPB6aUJQ\n\nPlease subscribe to Mark\u0027s new Channel - Las Vegas, Travel and More -\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYm2YEKqbO2Kz0Fn4nkUmuw\n\nTo purchase Merch for this channel including KOALA CALM, Joint Formula, Autographed books, shirts, coffee mugs etc,  click the Store button on our page, or go to our website - https://our-scientology-stories-p-shop.fourthwall.com/ \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCHOFqZ2gPwwZgnPB6aUJQ/join\n\nBuy us a Cup of Coffee - Donations are greatly appreciated -\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/messengeroi",

Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, made a significant decision to start his very own movie studio. This venture aimed to create Scientology training films, which were intended to educate and inform members of the church about its teachings and practices. To bring this vision to life, he enlisted his inexperienced Sea Organization staff, who lacked the film production skills typically needed for such an ambitious project. The staff became the target of Hubbard\u0027s wrath and abuse when they didn\u0027t perform to his liking. In this video, Janis Gillham Grady and Stuart Moreau tell  the fascinating story of the beginnings of what later evolved into Golden Era Studios. \n\nPurchase new \u0022Connection\u0022 Merchandise here at this link -\nhttps://our-scientology-stories-p-shop.fourthwall.com/\n\nRemember to Subscribe to our Channel - \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCHOFqZ2gPwwZgnPB6aUJQ\n\nPlease subscribe to Mark\u0027s new Channel - Las Vegas, Travel and More -\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYm2YEKqbO2Kz0Fn4nkUmuw\n\nTo purchase Merch for this channel including KOALA CALM, Joint Formula, Autographed books, shirts, coffee mugs etc,  click the Store button on our page, or go to our website - https://our-scientology-stories-p-shop.fourthwall.com/ \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCHOFqZ2gPwwZgnPB6aUJQ/join\n\nBuy us a Cup of Coffee - Donations are greatly appreciated -\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/messengeroi",

      "description": "In 1987, Scientology issued a policy that Sea Organization members could no longer get pregnant and have children if they wanted to stay in the Sea Organization.  This created a big problem for some people who found out they were pregnant right after the policy was issued.  \n\nDan Locke and his wife faced this situation.   If they had the child, one of them would be kicked out of the Sea Organization and made to work at an outer Scientology Organization away from their spouse.  Not only that, the child would be subjected  to the neglect, abuse and lack of education, while growing up under Sceintology\u0027s care.  They decided to stay.\n\nDan shares his story in detail on this video.   He and his wife at the time, were eventually kicked out and disgarded by Scientology 15 years later, along with their 15 year old son, to start their lives over.\n\nWatch this video for the rest of the details and story.    \n\nRemember to Subscribe to our Channel - \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCHOFqZ2gPwwZgnPB6aUJQ\n\nPlease subscribe to Mark\u0027s new Channel - Las Vegas, Travel and More -\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYm2YEKqbO2Kz0Fn4nkUmuw\n\nTo purchase Merch for this channel including KOALA CALM, Joint Formula, Autographed books, shirts, coffee mugs etc,  click the Store button on our page, or go to our website - https://our-scientology-stories-p-shop.fourthwall.com/ \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCHOFqZ2gPwwZgnPB6aUJQ/join\n\nBuy us a Cup of Coffee - Donations are greatly appreciated -\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/messengeroi",

On this video she talks about working at the Flag Land Base in Clearwater, Florida and how the craziness got worse and worse to the point that she had to leave.\n\nHer escape story was a harrowing experience, hiding from Scientology security, trying desparately to get a flight out of Florida to safety along with one of her children.     Her husband and son then escaped themselves a day later.\n\nHolly discusses what it was like after leaving Scientology for good and the fear that she had for many years afterwards.   \n\nHolly Carlson and her husband created very successful careers since leaving and are now enjoying retirement, traveling the country and spending time with family and friends.\n\nRemember to Subscribe to our Page -\n@MarkFisherandJanisGillhamGrady\n\nPlease subscribe to Mark\u0027s new Page - Las Vegas, Travel and More -\n@mfisherlv\n\nTo purchase Merch for this channel including KOALA CALM, Autographed books, shirts, coffee mugs etc,  click the Store button on our page, or go to our website - https://our-scientology-stories-p-shop.fourthwall.com/ \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCHOFqZ2gPwwZgnPB6aUJQ/join\n\nBuy us a Cup of Coffee - Donations are greatly appreciated -\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/messengeroi",

He got involved with Dianetics and Scientology in order to improve his performance.   He went on to become a successful Introductory Lecturer and trained many people to be Field Staff Members for Scientology in Australia and later England.\n\nRoger continued as a public Scientologist, paying for counseling and made it up to his top OT Levels when he was kicked out of Scientology in 1983, never to return.   He has been on his own Spiritual enlightment path ever since.\n\nRoger (88 years old) talks about Scientology in the 1950s, 60s, 70s and early 80s and where it eventually went wrong.   He considers L. Ron Hubbard a liar and a fraud.\n\nThis is his story.\n\nRemember to Subscribe to our Page -\n@MarkFisherandJanisGillhamGrady\n\nPlease subscribe to Mark\u0027s new Page - Las Vegas, Travel and More -\n@mfisherlv\n\nTo purchase Merch for this channel including KOALA CALM, Autographed Books, shirts, coffee mugs etc,  click the Store button on our page, or go to our website - https://our-scientology-stories-p-shop.fourthwall.com/ \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCHOFqZ2gPwwZgnPB6aUJQ/join\n\nBuy us a Cup of Coffee - Donations are greatly appreciated -\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/messengeroi",

He decided he wanted to join L. Ron Hubbard and his Sea Organization, so he stowed away on the ship when it left port.\n\nBel quickly was trained up in Scientology Processing (Counseling) up to Class 8 and became L. Ron Hubbard\u0027s personal Auditor in the early 1970s on the Apollo.  He also was friends with Hubbard\u0027s eldest son, Quentin Hubbard and a brief romantic relationship with Hubbard\u0027s daughter, Diana Hubbard.\n\nBel has great stories to share from those times.   What it was like on the Apollo, how was Hubbard as someone receiving counseling, etc.\n\nThis is the first of a series of interviews with Bel Ferradj.   He is no longer a Scientologist and lives in Morocco.\n\nRemember to Subscribe to our Page -\n@MarkFisherandJanisGillhamGrady\n\nPlease subscribe to Mark\u0027s new Page - Las Vegas, Travel and More -\n@mfisherlv\n\nTo purchase Merch for this channel including KOALA CALM, shirts, coffee mugs etc,  click the Store button on our page, or go to our website - https://our-scientology-stories-p-shop.fourthwall.com/ \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCHOFqZ2gPwwZgnPB6aUJQ/join\n\nBuy us a Cup of Coffee - Donations are greatly appreciated -\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/messengeroi",

      "description": "Mark Fisher and Janis Gillham Grady are joined by Sandy Holeman to discuss who was David Mayo and what happened to the Advanced Ability Center that Mayo set up with other former Scientology senior executives and technical personnel to deliver counseling in competition to Scientology in the mid 1980s.\n\nDavid Mayo was the Senior Case Supervisor International for Scientology, after years of training and interning with L. Ron Hubbard.   He was a Class 12 Senior Case Supervisor and was called upon to audit L. Ron Hubbard in the late 1970s when Hubbard was seriously ill and possibly could have died.\n\nHubbard turned against Mayo in the early 1980s, based on false reports by David Miscavige, resulting in Mayo being removed from his position, kicked out of Scientology and declared a Suppressive Person, along with many other senior Scientology executives.\n\nMayo then set up an outside group \u2013 the Advanced Ability Center (AAC) \u2013 with several other former executives and technical personnel (near Santa Barbara, California) to deliver counseling in competition with Scientology at greatly reduced pricing.\n\nThe Advanced Ability Center was then targeted heavily by Scientology and the Religious Technology Center for fair gaming and destruction.  The group was  infiltrated  by spies and the cult took legal actions against the AAC and Mayo himself.  The Advanced Ability Center eventually went out of business.\n\nSandy Holeman and her husband at the time, Roger Barnes, worked at the AAC during part of this time.  Sandy tells the story of what happened.\nWe hope you find this video informative.\n\nRemember to Subscribe to our Page -\n@MarkFisherandJanisGillhamGrady\n\nBuy us a Cup of Coffee - Donations are greatly appreciated -\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/messengeroi\n\nPlease subscribe to Mark\u0027s new Page - Las Vegas, Travel and More -\n@mfisherlv\n\nTo purchase Merch for this channel including KOALA CALM, shirts, coffee mugs etc,  click the Store button on our page, or go to our website - https://our-scientology-stories-p-shop.fourthwall.com/ \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCHOFqZ2gPwwZgnPB6aUJQ/join",

A legendary figure to some people, who was responsible for correcting the highest trained Scientology Counselors (Class 12s) in the world.\n\nAfter leaving the cult in the early 80s, he eventually became one of the first people on the internet in the 90\u0027s, speaking out about Scientology Technology and Policy, quoting from these policies in on-line debates.  Scientology tried to stop all discussion of their confidential policies and materials on the internet.\n\nSo in 1995,  Scientology got a court to order his home raided by Scientology agents (along with Law Enforcement), ransaking his home and taking his computer hard drives, along with other items and materials.\n\nDennis and his attorneys fought for years against Scientology over this attack on free speech and eventually all of us can now speak out freely on the internet about Scientology abuses.\n\nDennis now helps others recover from time in Scientology and other cults.\nIn this video we discuss with him how the technology and policies of Scientology entrap people from the moment they come in for help. \n\nRemember to Subscribe to our Page -\n@MarkFisherandJanisGillhamGrady\n\nPlease subscribe to Mark\u0027s new Page - Las Vegas, Travel and More -\n@mfisherlv\n\nTo purchase Merch for this channel including KOALA CALM, shirts, coffee mugs etc,  click the Store button on our page, or go to our website - https://our-scientology-stories-p-shop.fourthwall.com/ \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCHOFqZ2gPwwZgnPB6aUJQ/join\n\nBuy us a Cup of Coffee - Donations are greatly appreciated -\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/messengeroi",

Ron Hubbard by David Miscavige and others, which fed Hubbard\u0027s increasing paranoia while he was in hiding from the IRS and other lawsuits, in 1982 the top Scientology Management and Technical Executives were deemed as traitors and enemies of Hubbard and Scientology and were brought before a Scientology Justice Trial and summarily removed, kicked out of Scientology and declared Suppressive People.\n\nThis led to a reign of terror against the Scientology Mission Holder Network, which was a main source of new peopel into Scientology, under the direction of David Miscavige which resulted in their destruction.\n\nA large exoduc occurred of Scientology Staff and Public at that time.\n\nSandy Holeman joins Mark Fisher and Janis Gillham Grady in this Video to talk about what happened.   Her husband at the time (Roger Barnes) was one of the executives kicked out and Sandy was made to leave the Sea Organization and Scientology as well.\n\nRemember to Subscribe to our Page -\n@MarkFisherandJanisGillhamGrady\n\nPlease subscribe to Mark\u0027s new Page - Las Vegas, Travel and More -\n@mfisherlv\n\nTo purchase Merch for this channel including shirts, coffee mugs etc,  click the Store button on our page, or go to our website - https://our-scientology-stories-p-shop.fourthwall.com/ \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCHOFqZ2gPwwZgnPB6aUJQ/join\n\nBuy us a Cup of Coffee - Donations are greatly appreciated -\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/messengeroi",

It is the policy of Disconnection.\n\nRather than doing nothing, Phil raised the funds to put up billboards in Los Angelas and Clearwater, Florida asking for their loved ones to call them.   Scientology fought them with harrassment and dirty tricks.   The billboards eventually came down.\n\nNow Phil is back, with a new BIllboard that is posted outside the Scientology Big Blue Complex with a phone number that people trapped in Scientology and the Sea Organization can call for help.\n\nMark Fisher and Janis Gillham Grady did an interview with Phil Jones in July 2023 as part of a longer video regarding disconnection.

      "description": "Mark Fisher and Janis Gillham Grady are joined by John McLean for an interview.  John got involved in Scientology in the late 1960s as a teenager through his family up in Toronto, Canada.    He was recruited into the Sea Organization and sent to the Flagship Apollo at age 18 to work with L. Ron Hubbard.\n\nJohn recounts stories about life on the Apollo, working with Hubbard and witnessing Hubbard\u0027s abuses.   \n\nHe also tell the story of the coup d\u0027etat in Morocco against the King of Morocco while the Flagship Apollo and Hubbard were in the country trying to establish good relations with the Government.   Scientology decided to help the King locate those invoved with the coup by using Scientology Security Checking techniques (interogations) and John McLean was assigned the duty of getting the Scientology auditors together to do this.\n\nThe results did not turn out well and resulted in John deciding to leave the ship and the Sea Organization.  A fascinating story.\n\nJohn is the son of Nan McLean, who became an outspoken critic of Scientology in Canada in the early 70\u0027s.   We will cover those stories in our next interview with John McLean.\n\nWe hope you enjoy this interesting video.\n\nRemember to Subscribe to our Page -\n@MarkFisherandJanisGillhamGrady\n\nPlease subscribe to Mark\u0027s new Page - Las Vegas, Travel and More -\n@mfisherlv\n\nTo purchase Merch for this channel including shirts, coffee mugs etc,  click the Store button on our page, or go to our website - https://our-scientology-stories-p-shop.fourthwall.com/ \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCHOFqZ2gPwwZgnPB6aUJQ/join\n\nBuy us a Cup of Coffee - Donations are greatly appreciated -\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/messengeroi",

      "description": "Scott and Karry Campbell join Mark Fisher and Janis Gillham Grady to tell their horrifying story of abuse on the Scientology Sea Organization ship Freewinds.\n\nScott and Karry Campbell were 2 of the first people assigned to the Freewinds when the ship was first purchased and were trusted crew members who lived on the ship for several years.\n\nPunishments increased on the ship in the early 1990s and Scientology Public were being made to donate large sums of money to the International Association of Scientologists when Scott began to speak out and report what was going on.\n\nHis Grandmother was on her death bed and his family was calling for him to come see her before she passed away.   Scott requested a short leave and it was denied.   \n\nNot wanting to disappoint his large family, Scott left the Freewinds Ship and went into town to get a plane ticket to see his Grandmother and then come back to the ship.  Instead, Scientology Security captured him in town and physically put him in a vehicle, taking him back to the ship.\n\nThat began months of being locked up in a room on the Freewinds.  His food and drinks were drugged with Chloralhydrate and he was physically restricted to the room by his security guards for wanting to leave his captivity.   He was having a mental breakdown.\n\nMeanwhile, his wife Karry was left to wonder what was going on, was told her husband was having a psychotic incident and was not allowed to see him.\n\nAfter months of captivity on the ship, he was finally transported to the Scientology headquarters in Los Angelas with Karry where his captivity continued until they were finally let go and sent to Karry\u0027s Family home in California.  \n\nHowever, that wasn\u0027t the end of the story.....\n\nThis is part 1 of this story of abuse.  Part 2 will be released in a few days.\n\nRemember to Subscribe to our Page -\n@MarkFisherandJanisGillhamGrady\n\nPlease subscribe to Mark\u0027s new Page - Las Vegas, Travel and More -\n@mfisherlv\n\nTo purchase Merch for this channel including shirts, coffee mugs etc,  click the Store button on our page, or go to our website - https://our-scientology-stories-p-shop.fourthwall.com/ \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCHOFqZ2gPwwZgnPB6aUJQ/join\n\nBuy us a Cup of Coffee - Donations are greatly appreciated -\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/messengeroi",

Thousands of people protested in front of Scientology Buildings worldwide.\r\n\r\nWhat was Scientology\u0027s response?  \r\n\r\nSpecial Guest Mitch Brisker was closely involved in David Miscavige\u0027s counter attack against Anonymous and the protesters as part of the inner circle of Scientology executives and professionals advising Miscavige.  Hear what was happening behind the scenes.\r\n\r\nThis stream will also include a general discussion about Scientology and their many mistakes in dealing with the internet over the years.\r\n\r\nJoin Mark Fisher, Janis Grady and Special Guest Mitch Brisker for this Live Stream.\r\n\r\nAcoustic Guitar 1 by Audionautix is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",

He then worked for Scientology Media Productions - the Scientology TV Network for 2 years.\n\nHear Brisker\u0027s stories about filming at the Gold Base with the Sea Organization Film Crew.  During that time, he worked with many people and interacted with Scientology Leader David Miscavige.\n\nBrisker also tells about his chance meeting running into Shelly Miscavige sometime in 2008, after she had disappeared.  He also discusses the last time he saw former Scientology President Heber Jentzsch.\n\nBrisker covers the return of Marty Rathbun under Miscavige\u0027s and Scientology\u0027s control when Rathbun did his interviews attacking Leah Remini, Mike Rinder as well as others.\n\nHe also tells a humorous story about working with Mark Headley at the Gold Base and how competent Mark is.\n\nThis is Part 1 of our interviews with Mitch Brisker.
