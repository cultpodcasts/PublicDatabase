      "description": "English subtitles are available, turn them on in the video settings!\n\nIn this vlog-turned-music video, I set out on a journey through the streets of Seoul and Busan, hoping to experience firsthand Korea\u0027s hidden cult recruitment tactics. I\u0027ve heard countless stories about how cult members approach foreigners under the guise of friendship. With that in mind, I wandered around for hours, looking lost and lonely, ready to be recruited by a secretive group. Join me as I navigate the thin line between curiosity and danger while wasting my time looking for cults in Korea\u0027s bustling cities. \n\n\uD83D\uDCCC Remember to like, comment, and subscribe for more travel adventures!\n\n#SouthKorea #TravelAdventure #SoloTravel #Vlog #Seoul #Busan #cults \n\nFor my other vlogs or shorter, cinematic videos, check out the other videos on my channel!\n\nComments and/or questions are very welcome, drop them in the comments!\n\nFilmed in June 2024 and edited in August 2024 \n@TomasTravels",
