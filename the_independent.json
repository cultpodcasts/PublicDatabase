      "description": "House Republicans have started a push to hold former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in contempt of Congress.\n\nLawmakers said they intended to begin the process after the Clintons refused to testify in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, opening the prospect of the House using one of its most powerful punishments against a former president for the first time.\n\nThe contempt proceedings are an initial step toward a criminal prosecution by the Department of Justice that, if successful, could send the Clintons to prison in a dispute over compelling them to testify before the House Oversight Committee.\n\nFull article: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/hillary-clinton-bill-contempt-of-congress-proceedings-epstein-b2904928.html\n\nWatch more on Independent TV: https://tinyurl.com/yc7ukx9n\n\nThe Independent is the world\u2019s most free-thinking newsbrand, providing global news, commentary and analysis for the independently-minded.\n\nSubscribe: https://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Independent\n\nFind us on social:\nTikTok / https://www.tiktok.com/@independent\nInstagram / https://www.instagram.com/the.independent/\nX (Twitter) / https://twitter.com/Independent\nFacebook / https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline\n\nDownload the iOS \u0026 Android app: https://tinyurl.com/2s3ts5dh\nSign up to our newsletters: https://tinyurl.com/2bmw565x\n\nHelp to support truly independent journalism.

The photos are also undated and presented without context.\n\nBeing photographed with Epstein, or mentioned in documents, does not suggest wrongdoing.\n\nMarina Lacerda publicly identified herself a few months ago as someone who was abused by Epstein, and has called on officials to \u0022stop redacting names that don\u0027t need to be redacted.\u0022\n\nWatch more on Independent TV: https://tinyurl.com/yc7ukx9n\n\nThe Independent is the world\u2019s most free-thinking newsbrand, providing global news, commentary and analysis for the independently-minded.\n\nSubscribe: https://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Independent\n\nFind us on social:\nTikTok / https://www.tiktok.com/@independent\nInstagram / https://www.instagram.com/the.independent/\nX (Twitter) / https://twitter.com/Independent\nFacebook / https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline\n\nDownload the iOS \u0026 Android app: https://tinyurl.com/2s3ts5dh\nSign up to our newsletters: https://tinyurl.com/2bmw565x\n\nHelp to support truly independent journalism.
