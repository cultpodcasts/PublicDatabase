      "description": "Lawmakers who pushed the Department of Justice to release the Epstein files are dissatisfied with its latest disclosure of high-profile names mentioned in the three million documents, believing the DOJ is being purposefully vague to protect those with close ties to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nSaturday evening, the DOJ sent a six-page letter to Congress, including the names of celebrities, politicians, businesspeople and more who were mentioned at least once in the files. But the extensive list failed to explain how the people are connected to the pedophile financier and his fellow offender.\n\nNames ranged from President Donald Trump, who was once friends with Epstein but ceased communication before his 2008 Florida conviction, to apparently unrelated figures whose names happen to have been mentioned, like Marilyn Monroe, the Hollywood star who died when Epstein was nine years old, and the singer Janis Joplin, who died in 1970.\n\n\u201CThe DOJ is once again purposefully muddying the waters on who was a predator and who was mentioned in an email,\u201D Rep. Ro Khanna, one of the lawmakers leading the effort, said on X.\n\n\u201CTo have Janis Joplin, who died when Epstein was 17, in the same list as Larry Nassar, who went to prison for the sexual abuse of hundreds of young women and child pornography, with no clarification of how either was mentioned in the files is absurd,\u201D Khanna added.\n\nFull article: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/pam-bondi-epstein-files-names-b2920770.html\n\n#pambondi \n\nWatch more on Independent TV: https://tinyurl.com/yc7ukx9n\n\nThe Independent is the world\u2019s most free-thinking newsbrand, providing global news, commentary and analysis for the independently-minded.\n\nSubscribe: https://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Independent\n\nFind us on social:\nTikTok / https://www.tiktok.com/@independent\nInstagram / https://www.instagram.com/the.independent/\nX (Twitter) / https://twitter.com/Independent\nFacebook / https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline\n\nDownload the iOS \u0026 Android app: https://tinyurl.com/2s3ts5dh\nSign up to our newsletters: https://tinyurl.com/2bmw565x\n\nHelp to support truly independent journalism.

She then accused Democrats of using the Epstein files to distract from Trump\u0027s successes, despite Republicans initiating the furor and Bondi herself fanning the flames with binders for influencers last year. The hearing quickly devolved into a partisan brawl, with Bondi repeatedly lobbing insults at Democrats while insisting she was not \u201Cgoing to get in the gutter\u201D with them. In one particularly fiery exchange, Rep.

After Rep. Jamie Raskin kicked off the hearing by bringing forward Epstein survivors, Bondi apologized to the victims for the pain they\u2019ve suffered at the hands of \u201Cthat monster,\u201D Jeffrey Epstein. \u201CI\u2019m a career prosecutor, and despite what the ranking member said, I have spent my entire career fighting for victims, and I will continue to do so,\u201D Bondi said. Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to apologise to Epstein survivors for the \u0022unacceptable\u0022 release of their files. \u201CI wish that you would turn around to the survivors who are standing right behind them, and on a human level, apologize to them for what you have done,\u201D Jayapal added as her time was up. Lawmakers will probe the Justice Department\u0027s process for releasing information under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, following concerns over over-redaction and inconsistent releases. Only a small portion of the files were initially released by the Dec. 19 deadline, with further batches released later, leading to scrutiny from both Democrats and some Republicans.\n#epsteinfiles #Epstein #pambondi #trump \npam bondi hearing today.\n\nWatch more on Independent TV: https://tinyurl.com/yc7ukx9n\n\nThe Independent is the world\u2019s most free-thinking newsbrand, providing global news, commentary and analysis for the independently-minded.\n\nSubscribe: https://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Independent\n\nFind us on social:\nTikTok / https://www.tiktok.com/@independent\nInstagram / https://www.instagram.com/the.independent/\nX (Twitter) / https://twitter.com/Independent\nFacebook / https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline\n\nDownload the iOS \u0026 Android app: https://tinyurl.com/2s3ts5dh\nSign up to our newsletters: https://tinyurl.com/2bmw565x\n\nHelp to support truly independent journalism.
