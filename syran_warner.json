Things changed dramatically when an ambitious and charismatic deacon named Marc Bisset arrived from a church in Marshall, Texas and took over the group. \n\nToday, The Body exists on a compound in Tonasket, Washington. This is the home of a man named Christopher Coombes who was released on bail paid for by The Body\u0027s trust, Lookout Ranch, while awaits trial for the most severe of sex crimes. \n\nIn this video, Syran Warner illustrates how the current state of The Body is influenced by the past.

      "description": "We\u0027ll call this a short documentary to please the algorithms. It\u0027s an updated version of a video from 2021 documenting a wild attempt to get evidence concerning a destructive cult called The Body in the hands of the FBI. When the Bureau refuses to provide a method to send digital documents there way, a plan is hatched by a journalist to report himself for a serious crime while making the claim that a murder plot is on the computer he desperately wants an agent to take a look at. The target of the plot? Mitch McConnell. It\u0027s ridiculous, but a good example of how far this reporter will go in his battle against the cult. You\u0027ll notice some creative editing to turn this thing into safe and legal fun for adults. \n\nFor more information on The Body watch The Land of The Body: An Alaskan Cult Story or go to www.thebodyintl.com \n\nThis video contains music by Krill and Frankie Cosmos.",

Find out who\u0027s behind the cult and why their practice of \u0022washing\u0022 is so disturbing.
