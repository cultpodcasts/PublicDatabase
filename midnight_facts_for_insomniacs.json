      "description": "The first episode covered the origins; now it\u2019s time for the bloodbath. In part two of the Zizian cult series, Shane and Duncan unpack the chilling details of the group\u2019s most violent acts: samurai swords, parricide, and a vegan warlord with delusions of grandeur. From the calculated murders to the dramatic downfall, this is the story of how an online ideology turned into a real-world body count. ~ Support the show by becoming a Midnight Minion, Menace, or Maniac, and unlock exclusive bonus content over at PATREON ~ Chat with fellow insomniacs and vote on episode topics via DISCORD ~ Join the Midnight Masses!
