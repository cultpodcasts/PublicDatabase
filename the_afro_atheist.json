What damage do these teachings cause psychologically and culturally?\n\n\uD83E\uDDE2 Finally, we catch up on the ever-dramatic Jerry Eze and his world of noisy, theatrical prayer shows. What\u2019s he been up to lately, and why is his brand of \u0022prayertainment\u0022 gaining traction?\n\nThis conversation is about questioning narratives, unpacking manipulation, and empowering people\u2014especially the youth\u2014to ask hard questions.

      "description": "Today, we\u2019re catching up with Pastor Jerry Eze \u2014 the so-called prophet who\u2019s built a massive global platform, all while millions of Nigerians live in extreme poverty. How does a man of \u201CGod\u201D get rich off the desperation of his followers, while claiming miracles like God fixing toasters and healing madness?\n\nNigeria is the poverty capital of the world, yet pastors like Jerry continue to grow their wealth by selling hope \u2014 with no real solutions. Religion has become a business, and pastors are the CEOs. Let\u2019s talk about how these platforms are hurting more than they\u2019re helping, especially in Africa.\n\nIt\u2019s time to call out the manipulation, the emotional theatrics, and the empty promises.\n\nHit Subscribe, join the chat, and let\u2019s have this important conversation. \n#jerryeze #religionscam #nigeriapoverty #africanatheist #nsppdtruth #criticalthinkingnigeria #stopthedeception #decoloniseyourfaith #pastorbusiness #faithexploitation\n\nJoin in this great opportunity Want to create live streams like this?

      "description": "Ladies and gentlemen, we need to talk about one of the biggest religious scams happening right now\u2014Jerry Eze and his ever-expanding empire of deception.\n\nMeet Jerry Eze\u2014the self-proclaimed prayer warrior, miracle dispenser, and, most importantly, the CEO of Heaven\u2019s Repair Shop. While over 80 million Nigerians are struggling to afford basic necessities, Jerry is out here convincing his followers that God is busy fixing their broken blenders, microwaves, and\u2014wait for it\u2014a toy crab that costs just \u00A311 on Amazon.\n\nYes, a toy crab.\n\nRecently, Jerry told his followers to lay hands on their broken inanimate objects and pray. And, like clockwork, testimonies started rolling in. Apparently, God and His angels descended from heaven, bypassed world hunger, war, and injustice, and got to work fixing 16-year-old blenders, 15-year-old broken phones, iPads, ring lights, and microwaves. Because clearly, these are the most pressing issues in the world today.\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a step back and really think about this. Nigeria is in a deep economic crisis, with millions struggling to eat, afford healthcare, and find jobs. The roads are bad, insecurity is rampant, and corruption is at an all-time high. But instead of questioning why their prayers aren\u2019t fixing these issues, people are celebrating the miracle of a repaired kitchen appliance.\n\nAnd Jerry? Oh, he\u2019s doing just fine. In fact, he now has over 14 churches worldwide, expanding his empire while his followers keep getting poorer. Because let\u2019s be real\u2014these prayers aren\u2019t fixing their bank accounts, only Jerry\u2019s.\n\nSo let me ask the obvious question: If faith and prayer worked the way Jerry claims, shouldn\u2019t Nigeria, with all its endless fasting and hallelujah challenges, be the richest and most developed country on earth? Instead, the poverty rate keeps climbing while Jerry keeps expanding.\n\nSomething isn\u2019t adding up.\n\nAnd yet, instead of seeing through the scam, people are more convinced than ever. They don\u2019t ask why God is fixing blenders instead of ending their suffering. They don\u2019t question why their situation never improves, no matter how much they pray.

      "description": "Years after Pastor John Gray\u0027s public cheating scandal, his wife Aventer Gray remains by his side\u2014claiming God told her to stay. In this stream, we dive into the dangerous narrative that religion often pushes on women: that staying in a broken, humiliating marriage is their divine role. Despite his ego, repeated failures, and lack of accountability, John Gray still commands a platform, while Aventer frames her endurance as spiritual growth. But is this really growth\u2014or religious gaslighting? Let\u0027s talk about how religion conditions women to accept betrayal, suffering, and silence in the name of faith.\nLet\u2019s talk about how religion convinces women to endure pain, betrayal, and disrespect, calling it \u201CGod\u2019s will.\u201D This isn\u2019t strength. It\u2019s indoctrination.\nJoin the conversation as we unpack Pastor John Gray, religious manipulation, and the lie that suffering is holy.\n\n#johngray #aventergrey #religionandmarriage #toxicfaith #blackchurch #womensuffering #faithgaslighting #religiousabuse #churchculture #exchristian #leavingreligion #deconstruction #exvangelical\n\nJoin in this great opportunity Want to create live streams like this?

This vague, controlled, and carefully worded statement tells us more by what it doesn\u2019t say than by what it does.\n\nJames Kawalya, the man Aladiran once proudly platformed, is now at the centre of serious allegations \u2014 yet we are still being fed silence, ambiguity, and PR talk. What exactly are the allegations? Why won\u2019t James Aladiran come clean?

And those who endorsed him must be held accountable too.\n\nLet\u2019s break it all down \u2014 together.\n\n#jamesaladiran #jameskawalya #prayerstorm #religiousaccountability #falseprophets #churchscandals #exposingfrauds #criticalthinking #calloutculture #atheistvoice",

In this livestream, we\u2019ll dive into how anyone can wake up one day and claim to be a pastor, prophet, or preacher \u2014 with no regulation, no verification, and often, no accountability. This chaos in religious leadership puts lives at risk, silences victims, and creates fear-based followings built on manipulation.\n\nWhy do I speak out against Christianity, especially in the Nigerian and African context? Because we must face the reality that religion has done more harm than good in many communities. It is time to question, challenge, and dismantle the systems that allow abuse to hide under the cloak of \u201Canointing.\u201D\n\nWe will look at references, similar cases, and explore:\n\nWho verifies these so-called \u201Cmen of God\u201D?\nHow do we know who is telling the truth?\nWhy is religious control in Africa dangerously weak?\nWhat can we do to raise awareness and protect ourselves and our communities?\nJoin me for this important discussion as we shine a light on the #WhereIsEjiro case and the deeper problem at the heart of African religious culture.\n\n\nJoin in this great opportunity Want to create live streams like this?

Why is Prayer Storm and James Aladiran suddenly silent?\n\nAs someone who called out the inconsistencies and irrational claims in Kawalya\u2019s story from day one, I\u2019m here to say: I told you so. This moment isn\u0027t just a personal scandal \u2014 it\u2019s a massive blow to the credibility of any claims James has ever made. And it raises serious questions about the platforms that gave him a microphone.\n\nJames Aladiran publicly declared that Prayer Storm has no further connection with Kawalya \u2014 but that\u2019s not enough. The public deserves full transparency. If Aladiran knows something and chooses to keep it hidden, then he\u2019s not just protecting James \u2014 he\u2019s complicit in the deception.\n\nNow is not the time for silence.

While over 80 million Nigerians are struggling to afford basic necessities, Jerry is out here convincing his followers that God is busy fixing their broken blenders and toy crabs.\n\nAnd guess what? Business is booming! Jerry Eze now has over 14 churches worldwide, raking in millions, while his followers\u2014many of whom can barely afford three meals a day\u2014keep pouring in their hard-earned money, believing that their financial breakthrough is just one NSPPD prayer challenge away.\n\nNow, let\u2019s do some quick math: If faith truly worked the way Jerry claims, shouldn\u2019t Nigeria, with all its endless fasting and prayers, be one of the most prosperous nations on earth? Instead, the poverty rate keeps rising, while Jerry keeps expanding his empire. Something isn\u2019t adding up, but hey\u2014at least their broken microwaves are getting divine attention, right?\n\nWant to create live streams like this?

Out of curiosity, I clicked in\u2026 but what I heard left me speechless.\nInstead of honoring the woman\u2019s life with dignity and reflection, the entire service became a full-blown evangelism crusade. The preacher used her death as a marketing strategy for Jesus\u2014inviting people to give their lives to Christ, guilt-tripping the audience, and turning the solemn moment into a salvation pitch.\nWhere is the respect? Where is the dignity for the dead? Even in death, RCCG and Adeboye\u2019s church can\u0027t let go of their control. The woman\u2019s legacy was overshadowed, her identity erased and replaced with sermon points. This livestream is not to disrespect the dead, but to expose a system that continues to manipulate and gaslight\u2014right to the grave.\nIt\u2019s time to speak up.\n\n#rccgfunerals #eaadeboye #religiousgaslighting #nigerianchurchculture #nofaithindignity #evenindeth #rccgexposed #respectthedead #atheistvoice #exchristianstories\n\nJoin in this great opportunity Want to create live streams like this?

So, what exactly has five years of Jerry Eze\u2019s movement achieved, apart from making him wealthier?\n\nTonight, we\u2019re exposing the false hope of religion, questioning its role in keeping Nigerians stuck, and challenging the idea that prayer\u2014not real action\u2014can change lives.\n\nJoin the discussion, bring your critical thinking, and let\u2019s talk about real solutions, not religious deception.\n\n#jerryeze #nspdd #fakepastors #miraclescam #religiousfraud #nigerianpoverty #criticalthinking #deconstructingfaith\n\nJoin in this great opportunity Want to create live streams like this?

      "description": "Dr. Paul Enenche, the founder of Dunamis International Gospel Centre, is once again in the spotlight\u2014but not for reasons he\u2019d like. This is a man who claims to perform divine miracles, yet all we see are staged performances, emotional manipulation, and outright scams. His church operates more like a business empire, preying on desperate believers while silencing anyone who dares to expose the truth.\n\nIn this livestream, we\u2019ll break down:\n\nThe fake miracles that keep the money flowing into Dunamis Church\nHow Enenche and his followers intimidate and even arrest critics who speak out against his deception\nThe cult-like control he exercises over his congregation\nThe dangerous effects of his faith-healing claims, especially for sick and vulnerable people who forgo real medical care\nThe bigger picture: How megachurches like Dunamis exploit Nigerians while offering nothing in return\nThis is a church that needs to be exposed over and over again! If you\u0027re tired of seeing these so-called \u0022men of God\u0022 getting away with deception, join me as we break it all down. Share this with someone who needs to hear the truth.

      "description": "Marvin Sapp recently made some shocking statements that confirm what many of us have been saying for years\u2014Christianity is nothing more than a money-making scheme. As an atheist, watching this was deeply concerning because it\u2019s clear that many preachers today are not even trying to hide the fact that the church is a business. Christianity is going through a rough time, with more pastors being exposed for corruption, greed, and manipulation. Yet, people still refuse to see the truth.\n\nWhen will people realise that religion is costing them more than just their money\u2014it\u2019s costing them their critical thinking, independence, and even their dignity?

      "description": "Ladies and gentlemen, we need to talk about the absolute absurdity happening in the world of Nigerian Christianity, and today, our focus is on none other than Jerry Eze and his ever-growing NSPPD movement.\n\nRecently, Jerry told his followers to pray over their inanimate objects\u2014yes, you heard that right. Phones, microwaves, blenders, iPads, ring lights\u2014whatever was broken, he told them to lay hands on it, and miraculously, they all came back with testimonies of how their God-fixing services had been rendered!\n\nNow, I want you to really think about this: these people are genuinely convinced that the Almighty God, the creator of the universe, took time out of His divine schedule to come down and fix\u2026 a 16-year-old blender, a 15-year-old broken phone, and\u2014wait for it\u2014a toy crab that costs \u00A311 on Amazon.\n\nYes. A toy crab.\n\nThis is where we are now. Instead of asking why their prayers haven\u2019t fixed Nigeria\u2019s collapsing economy, insecurity, or poverty, they\u2019re celebrating a divine repair service for kitchen appliances and children\u0027s toys.\n\nCan they not see how ridiculous this is? Does it not cross their minds that maybe, just maybe, they are being played?\n\nAnd of course, Jerry Eze knows exactly what he\u2019s doing. This isn\u2019t about faith\u2014it\u2019s about control. It\u2019s about keeping people so emotionally invested in nonsense that they never stop to ask the real questions:\n\nWhy is God fixing blenders instead of helping the poor?\nWhy are these so-called miracles always things that can be easily faked?\nWhy is it that despite years of these prayer challenges, Nigeria is still getting worse?\nBut here\u2019s the saddest part: the people who believe in this nonsense are often the same ones struggling the most. The same ones who need real change in their lives, not empty religious rituals that do nothing but make their pastor richer.\n\nSo I ask, when will people wake up? When will they realize that religion in Nigeria has become a performance, a circus of gullibility where people genuinely believe their kitchen appliances are a priority for divine intervention?\n\nWake up, people. God isn\u2019t fixing your blenders\u2014your pastor is fixing your mindset to keep you blind.\n\nWant to create live streams like this?

Let\u2019s talk about it! \r\nTune in for an honest conversation that challenges these exploitative religious traditions and sheds light on how we can break free from them.\r\n#matthewashimolowo #kicc #kiccchurch #nigeria #tithescam #matthewashimolowo #religionandmoney #nigerianpastors #atheistperspective #churchcorruption #questionreligion #religiousmanipulation #freethought #breakfreefromreligion\r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

As an atheist, I\u2019ll dive into why this is yet another example of religion failing to deliver on its promises of supernatural power or divine rescue.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s have an honest conversation about the delusion of divine favor, the scam of religious power, and why it\u2019s time for people to wake up to the truth: Jakes, like all others, is just human.

Why do some Christian communities reject Halloween, and what beliefs drive this avoidance? As atheists, let\u0027s explore the roots of these views and why a make-believe holiday causes such alarm. Joining me today, we\u0027ll discuss this with guests like @Inspiring Philosophy, @ed citronnelli, @pastor mark driscoll, and @KeziaKNwafor to dive deep into the Halloween controversy and why it\u2019s been a point of division.

      "description": "In this video, we dive into Apostle Johnson Suleman\u2019s recent statements revealing the troubling culture of corruption and power dynamics in Nigerian Christianity. Apostle Suleman openly describes how \u0022spiritual fathers\u0022 protect each other and close ranks against critics, regardless of moral or legal wrongdoings. He even admits to evading consequences with their help, highlighting how influence is wielded to defend criminal actions rather than uphold integrity.\n\nWe\u2019ll explore how these church leaders often demand honour and loyalty from younger preachers, creating a system that stifles accountability. This video exposes the widespread issues in Nigerian Christianity, showing how some of the country\u2019s most prominent pastors prioritise power and mutual protection over justice and morality.\n#apostlesuleman #bishopdavidoyedepo #pastoreaadeboye #pastorwfkumuyi #ayooritsejafor #wfkumuyi #nigerianchristianity #spiritualfathers #churchcorruption #religiousaccountability #nigerianpastors #exposingcorruption #churchscandals #powerdynamics #falsedoctrine #christianityinfluence #religiousmanipulation",

Ali Dawah has jumped into the conversation, but in a surprising twist, he points fingers at the Jewish community. How did a personal interaction in Mecca turn into a larger narrative blaming an entire group?\r\n\r\nJoin us as we break down the layers of this story and question the claim that Mecca\u2019s sanctity shields people from being who they truly are. As atheists, we challenge the idea that anyone, even in holy cities, can be shaped by religious surroundings alone. Is this proof that individuals, regardless of location or belief, will live their truth?

From false promises of miracles to the relentless demands for tithes, Adeboye has built an empire on manipulation and fear. We investigate his failed prophecies, the millions wasted on Redemption Camp, and the exploitation of his followers who are pressured into giving up 10, 20, even 40 percent of their income. This is a must-watch for anyone who has ever questioned the real motives behind religious leaders especially. This documentary also highlights what the future of Christianity in Nigeria and Africa will become with men like Adeboye at the helm of religious affairs. \uFFFC",

Michael Orokpo claims that pastors deserve tithes because they are \u0022doing the work of God\u0022\u2014but if they\u2019re working for God, shouldn\u2019t their payment come from Him?

      "description": "As an atheist committed to critical thinking, I\u2019m diving deep into two disturbing cases where children with severe congenital issues were paraded as being \u0027healed\u0027 at religious events. First, we\u0027ll look at Pastor Jerry Eze\u2019s UK conference, where a young girl with cerebral palsy was claimed to be healed\u2014yet only gained some motion in her legs, leaving her condition unchanged. Then, we\u2019ll examine the case of a child from the Lord\u2019s Chosen Church, where similar claims were made, but it\u2019s clear the child wasn\u2019t truly healed.\n\nWhy are these children being presented as miracles when their conditions persist? Why should gaining some leg motion be touted as a divine healing instead of addressing the root cause of their suffering? This exploitation raises serious ethical questions, and it\u2019s time we had an honest conversation about it. Join me as I dissect these claims, highlight the dangers of false hope, and advocate for a more rational, compassionate approach to dealing with disabilities.\n\n#Atheism #CriticalThinking #ExposingFaithHealing #JerryEze #LordsChosenChurch #CerebralPalsy #FaithHealingExposed #ReligiousExploitation",

In an event that has captured significant attention, Eze has asserted that he healed a child with cerebral palsy, allowing her to walk. However, a closer look at this so-called \u0027miracle\u0027 reveals a disheartening and, frankly, disgusting reality. While the child may have been able to walk, she has not been cured of cerebral palsy.\r\n\r\nAs an atheist committed to truth and rationality, we find it essential to challenge these narratives that exploit vulnerable individuals and perpetuate false hope. We\u0027ll dissect the claims, scrutinise the evidence, and discuss the ethical implications of such assertions. Join us as we seek to uncover the truth behind Jerry Eze\u2019s controversial statement and advocate for genuine, science-based understanding and support for those living with cerebral palsy.\r\n\r\nJoin in this great opportunity Want to create live streams like this?

As an atheist reviewer, I find this approach highly questionable and potentially exploitative.

The pupil, who cannot be named for legal reasons, took the action against Michaela Community School in Brent, north London, claiming the policy \u0022uniquely\u0022 affects her faith, with prayer one of its five pillars. \nIn a written judgment on Tuesday, Mr Justice Linden said: \u0022She [the pupil] knew that the school is secular and her own evidence is that her mother wished her to go there because it was known to be strict, Ms Birbalsingh, headteacher introduced the policy in March 2023, after up to 30 students began praying in the school\u0027s yard, using blazers to kneel on.\n\nThe court also heard the school was targeted with a \u0022bomb hoax\u0022, death threats, abuse and \u0022false\u0022 allegations of Islamophobia.\n\nReversing the school\u0027s \u0022emergency\u0022 ban would again expose it to \u0022an unacceptable risk of threats\u0022, lawyers said, adding it avoided \u0022the logistical disruption and detriments to other school activities\u0022.",

As the death toll rises, debate is raging over whether bad organisation, weather or gate-crashing pilgrims are to blame for more than 1,000 reported deaths in Saudi Arabia during the annual Hajj religious gathering but where is their God when they go visit the holy land?

      "description": "The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye has replied critics of his ridiculous tea drinking shenanigans with God. Adeboye who was visibly perturbed by the spate of criticisms that have trailed the church in recent times said \u201CIf Paul who wrote more than half of the New Testament claimed to be less than the least of the saint, Pastor Adeboye is nothing.\u201D\n\n\u201CAdeboye is one stupid boy. But His God is wiser than the wisest. Adeboye is weak. Believe it or not, he eats pounded yam, he goes to the toilet. But his God is stronger than the strongest. Adeboye is nothing. But his God is the all-sufficient God. So, there is nothing spectacular if you mock Pastor Adeboye. He deserves to be mocked.\u201D\n\nAdeboye said further that \u201Cthe word of God made it clear that anyone God will use must be foolish, must be weak, must be a nobody so that nobody will get the glory. This is the ridiculous response from Adeboye, his tactics don\u0027t go unnoticed, his passive aggressive gaslighting is how he handles criticism. Christianity is being exposed and Adeboye and his delusions are being exposed one story at a time.\n\nIf you would like to support the Channel you can do so on \nCashApp: \u00A3africanhumanist\nPaypal: africanhumanistmum@gmail.com\n\nThese aim to show what goes on in religion especially Cristianity being that I am an ex-Christian.

      "description": "Description:\r\nIn this thought-provoking debate, Christian apologist GodLogic and Muslim scholar Hamza engage in a spirited dialogue about the authenticity and truth claims of their respective holy texts, the Bible and the Quran. Both sides passionately argue for the supremacy of their faith, presenting compelling evidence and interpretations to support their positions.\r\n\r\nHowever, as the debate unfolds, a surprising conclusion emerges: rather than definitively proving one religion right and the other wrong, both participants challenge the audience to consider the possibility that neither religion holds a monopoly on truth. Through rigorous examination and critical analysis, they deconstruct common arguments and expose potential inconsistencies within their own scriptures.\r\n\r\nAs the conversation delves deeper, viewers are encouraged to question preconceived notions and explore alternative perspectives on spirituality and belief systems. Ultimately, the debate serves as a catalyst for introspection and open-minded dialogue, challenging viewers to confront the complexities of religious pluralism and the search for ultimate truth.\r\n\r\nJoin us for a thought-provoking journey into the heart of faith and reason, where God Logic and Hamza engage in a compelling exchange that challenges the very foundations of religious certainty.\r\nIf you would like to support the Channel you can consider becoming a channel member or make a contribution to\r\nCashApp: \u00A3africanhumanist\r\nPaypal: africanhumanistmum@gmail.com\r\n#theafroatheist#christianity #deconversion #deconstructingfaith #biblelies #atheist  #walkingawayfromreligion #freedomfromreligion #agnostic #freethinker #religionisascam #religionisbillshit #agnosticism #jesus #holyghost #god #islam #muslim",

      "description": "The General Overseer of Omega Fire Ministries and one of Nigeria\u2019s controversial Christian clerics, Johnson Suleman recently stirred a serious controversy on the social media and in the Nigerian Christian circle when he hinted that it was possible for Paul the Apostle in the Bible to have contradicted Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\nThe comments of Suleman  drew the ire of many Nigerian Christian faithful. But an undaunted Suleman in a viral video reiterated his stand. As critical thinkers, these men continue to help us prove Christianity as false. They have gone years lying to Africans and their lies are catching up to them. So, join me as we expose Christianity and its corrupt nd morally bankrupt clerics in Africa the likes of Johnson Suleman, Joshua Selman, WF Kumuyi and the others",

      "description": "Security forces swept through large forests in Nigeria\u2019s northwest region on Friday in search of nearly 300 children abducted from their school by motorcycle-riding gunmen in the latest mass kidnapping, which analysts and activists blamed on the failure of intelligence and a slow security response.\r\n\r\nThe abduction of the 287 children in Kaduna state, near the West African nation\u2019s capital, is one of the largest school kidnappings in the decade since the kidnapping of schoolgirls in Borno state\u2019s Chibok village in 2014 stunned the world. Analysts and activists say the security lapses that allowed that mass abduction remain.\r\n\r\nThe victims of the latest attack \u2014 among them at least 100 children aged 12 or under \u2014 were surrounded and marched into a forest just as they were starting the school day, said locals in Kuriga town, located 55 miles (89 kilometers) from the city of Kaduna. One man was shot dead as he tried to save the students, school authorities said.\r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this? Check out StreamYard: https://streamyard.com/pal/d/5719281357291520",

      "description": "This video highlights how the late TB Joshua faked a Miracle.\n\nThe preacher, who is accused of widespread abuse and torture spanning almost 20 years, founded his Synagogue Church of All Nations (Scoan) in Lagos more than three decades ago. His meteoric rise to fame was closely tied to his self-professed divine powers and his supposed ability to heal the sick.\n\nThe theatrical healings - showing the physically disabled walking and on one occasion purporting to resurrect a dead person - were filmed. Along with testimonies of those he claimed to have cured, they were then sent on VHS tapes to churches across the world.\n\nIn 2004, Nigeria\u0027s broadcast regulator banned stations from airing the supposed miracles of pastors on live terrestrial TV, prompting Joshua to launch Emmanuel TV on satellite and then online. His global television and social media empire became one of the most successful Christian networks in the world. His purported miracles were broadcast to millions across Europe, the Americas, South-East Asia and Africa. His YouTube channel had hundreds of millions of views.\n\nBut Joshua, who died in 2021 aged 57, was a fraud. The BBC\u0027s investigation, involving more than 25 church insiders from the UK, Nigeria, Ghana, the US, South Africa and Germany, unpicks six ways in which he tricked worshippers.",

But since 2007, things have changed with surprising speed. From 2007 to 2020, an overwhelming majority (43 out of 49) of these same countries became less religious. This decline in belief is strongest in high-income countries but it is evident across most of the world (Inglehart, 2021).",

      "description": "Christianity in the UK is steadily on a decline and in serious trouble, and this gives me immense pleasure. Since the 1990s, the Anglican Communion has struggled with controversy regarding homosexuality in the church. In 1998, the 13th Lambeth Conference of Anglican bishops passed a resolution \u0022rejecting homosexual practice as incompatible with Scripture\u201D. However, this is not legally binding. Like all Lambeth Conference resolutions, it is not legally binding on all provinces of the Communion, including the Church of England, though it commends an essential and persuasive view of the attitude of the Communion. Anglican national churches in Brazil, South Africa, South India, New Zealand and Canada have taken steps toward approving and celebrating same-sex relationships amid strong resistance among other national churches within the 80 million-member global body. The Episcopal Church in the U.S. has allowed same-sex marriage since 2015, and the Scottish Episcopal Church has allowed same-sex marriage since 2017.Church of England clergy have appeared to signal support for gay marriage after they rejected a bishops\u0027 report which said that only a man and woman could marry in church. At General Synod in 2019, the Church of England announced that same-gender couples may remain recognised as married after one spouse experiences a gender transition. In 2023, the Church of England announced that it would authorise \u0022prayers of thanksgiving, dedication and for God\u0027s blessing for same-sex couples",

      "description": "The daughter of the late Anglican archbishop Desmond Tutu has been barred by the Church of England from officiating at her godfather\u2019s funeral in a Shropshire church because she is married to a woman.\n\nMpho Tutu van Furth, an ordained priest in the Anglican church, was invited to preside over the funeral of Martin Kenyon, who died last week at the age of 92. The C of E said its actions were \u201Cin line with the House of Bishops current guidance on same-sex marriage\u201D.\n\nTutu van Furth\u2019s wife, Marceline, a Dutch academic, accused the C of E of homophobia. She said the couple had visited Kenyon in April, and he asked Mpho to preside over his funeral.\nKenyon\u2019s family were forced to relocate Thursday\u2019s funeral service from St Michael and All Angels church, in Wentnor, near Bishops Castle, to a marquee in the grounds of the former vicarage next door in order to allow Tutu van Furth to preside in an unofficial capacity.\n\n\u201CThe family are devastated at the church\u2019s decision,\u201D a family friend said. \u201CEven in a conservative rural hinterland like Shropshire, people are appalled at what has happened. It\u2019s unchristian and unjust.\u201D\n\n#theafroatheist #christianity #deconversion #deconstructing faith #biblelies #atheist #atheism #walkingawayfromreligion #freedomfromreligion #agnostic #freethinker #religionisascam #religionisbullshit #agnosticism",

She raises concerns on what she terms the deafening silence of Nigerian human rights activist on LGBT rights. She also talks about homophobia in Nigeria and the forces driving the\u2019Jail the Gays\u2019 bill in Africa. The Nigerian constitution has a bill, which contains penalties of up to 14 years in prison and bans gay marriage, same-sex \u0022amorous relationships\u0022 and membership of gay rights groups, Yemisi\u2019s voice is very important in the LGBTQ community and secular community.\r\n\r\nLinks to her book and YouTube channel are below.

      "description": "Two centuries ago Sarah Baartman died after years spent in European \u0022freak shows\u0022. Brought to Europe seemingly on false pretences by a British doctor, stage-named the \u0022Hottentot Venus\u0022, she was paraded around \u0022freak shows\u0022 in London and Paris, with crowds invited to look at her large buttocks.The Sarah Baartman story is often regarded as the epitome of racist colonial exploitation, and of the commodification of the dehumanization of black people. Science and the understanding of human anatomy too has been problematic as there were at least seven scientific descriptions of the bodies of black women done in comparative anatomy. Cuvier\u0027s dissection of Baartman helped shape European science. Baartman, along with several other African women who were dissected, were referred to as Hottentots, or sometimes Bushwoman. The \u0022savage woman\u0022 was seen as very distinct from the \u0022civilised female\u0022 of Europe, thus 19th-century scientists were fascinated by \u0022the Hottentot Venus\u0022. In the 1800s, people in London were able to pay two shillings apiece to gaze upon her body. Baartman was considered a freak of nature. For extra pay, one could even poke her with a stick or finger. These components and events in Baartman\u0027s life have been used by activists and theorists to determine the ways in which 19th-century European colonists exercised control and authority over Khoikhoi people and simultaneously crafted racist and sexist ideologies \n\nIf you would like to support the Channel you can consider becoming a Channel member or\nMake a contribution to \nCashApp: \u00A3africanhumanist\nPaypal: africanhumanistmum@gmail.com\n\n#theafroatheist #sarahbaartman, #africa  #southafrica #racism #christianity #deconversion #deconstructingfaith #biblelies #atheist  #walkingawayfromreligion #freedomfromreligion #agnostic #freethinker #religionisascam #religionisbillshit #agnosticism",

      "description": "The High Court in Barbados has struck down British colonial-era laws regarding gay sex in what activists are calling a \u201Cresounding victory for LGBT people\u201D.\n\nOn Monday (12 December) the Caribbean court struck down sections 9 and 12 of the Barbados Sexual Offences Act. Known as the \u2018buggery\u2019 and \u2018indecency\u2019 laws both criminalised same-sex activity. Under section 9 men faced life imprisonment if caught. Under section 12, both men and women could be jailed for 10 years.\n\nBarbados was one of only seven countries in the Western Hemisphere that criminalised same-sex relations. Courts in Antigua and Barbuda and St Kitts and Nevis struck down similar laws earlier this year.

Magor had made the comments supposedly in defence of Pitbulls, as calls for the vicious dogs heighten after numerous deadly maulings. In the voice note, Magor agrees with a fellow group member\u0027s comments and adds: \u0022What I say is ban the black man. They rape, they steal, they kill, worse than any pitbull could, and they get away with it. Ban those that are making the laws, ban Ekurhuleni, ban the black man. Get all the black women and cut out their uteruses and ovaries so they cannot procreate. They will all turn out the same because they are all the same. I\u2019m very passionate about this. Ban them, kill them, shoot them. Please get rid of them because they are the problem. Not pit bulls, not animals. Animals are beautiful, and they deserve a warm bed, food, love and attention and everything else. God created those animals. Who created the black man, do you think God?

The 2011 census figures were 45% Catholic and 48% Protestant. Neither bloc is a majority.\r\nThe demographic tilt was expected but will still deliver a psychological hit to unionists, who for decades relied on a supposedly impregnable Protestant majority to safeguard Northern Ireland\u2019s position in the UK.\r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

      "description": "This livestream is a special request from a supporter of the channel. The Civil War shaped America in many ways, and its ramifications can still be seen today. According to some of these people who take place in re-enactment, it is educational to dig deep into the past to remember the whole history behind the conflict. Unfortunately it is a one sided narrative as It is an offensive past but the people who take part in the civil war re-enactment do it to develop an emotional connection to the offensive past. The question now we is how is history beneficial to us when it one sided and designed to suit a narrative? Who gets to reenact the narrative of the slaves? . #theafroatheist #history #america #slavery #slavetrade #reenactment #america #usa \r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

      "description": "Torben S\u00F8ndergaard (1976\u2013) is a Danish Christian evangelist, self-proclaimed apostle, and faith healer, who claims to receive revelations and visions directly from God. His organization, The Last Reformation, has been described as extreme, dangerous and a cult by former followers, former board members of the organization, the press, other churches, and professionals. The Last Reformation desires to return Christianity to the Book of Acts.\r\nS\u00F8ndergaard and his cult are elitist and teach that only S\u00F8ndergaard\u0027s \u0022True Gospel\u0022 as well as S\u00F8ndergaard\u0027s methods will result in the true doctrines and true discipleship that can bring about the final reformation of the worldwide Christian church before the end of the world.\r\nHe has been criticized for numerous things, including teaching that autism is caused by demonic possession and can be cured by immersion in water-filled trash cans, as well as claiming to be able to cure homosexuality, cancer and remove \u0022the Spirit of Reiki Healing\u0022 from Reiki practitioners in the same manner.\r\nS\u00F8ndergaard was living in Denmark until 2019, where Danish politicians stated that they would be looking into S\u00F8ndergaard\u0027s organization in Denmark and the potentially illegal actions carried out by it. Shortly after this, S\u00F8ndergaard left Denmark and has shut down his Danish organization and started a new one in the US by the name \u0022The Last Reformation Inc. S\u00F8ndergaard now falsely claims he is religiously persecuted in Denmark, one of the most democratic countries with the most religious freedom in the world.\r\nIn September 2019, S\u00F8ndergaard moved to North Carolina where he claims he is preparing \u0022Noah\u0027s Ark\u0022,referring to his disciples as \u0022animals\u0022 and has a continued public appeal for donations, for example encouraging you to \u0022pray if you are one of the \u0027animals\u0027 (people) God is calling to help with the rest of the money. He Later changed his mind and moved on to other project. It is unknown where the collected funds went.\r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

      "description": "G-man, the Christian has had a falling out with his close Christian friends, another to punish them. He decides to dox all their personal chats and conversations. Doxing is the act of revealing someone\u2019s sensitive information online. Hackers use doxing to harass, threaten, or get revenge on others. The term \u0027Doxing\u0027 is short for \u0022dropping dox\u0022 \u0027dox\u0027 being slang for documents. Typically, doxing is a malicious act, used against people with whom the hacker disagrees or dislikes. Doxing (sometimes written as Doxxing) is the act of revealing private information online, that information is then circulated to the public \u2014 without the victim\u0027s permission. doxing also refers to personal information exposure. Doxers aim to escalate their conflict with targets from online to the real world, by revealing information which includes embarrassing personal details. The motivations behind doxing vary. People feel they have been attacked or insulted by their target and could be seeking revenge as a result. Intentionally revealing personal information online usually comes with the intention to punish, intimidate, or humiliate the victim in question. That said, doxers can also see their actions as a way to right perceived wrongs, bring someone to justice in the public eye, or reveal an agenda that has previously not been publicly disclosed.\u00A0\r\nRegardless of the motivation, the core purpose of doxing is to violate privacy, and it can put people in an uncomfortable situation \u2014 sometimes with dire consequences.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to support the Channel you can do so on \r\nCashApp: \u00A3africanhumanist\r\nPaypal: africanhumanistmum@gmail.com\r\n\r\n#theafrohumanist #christianity #deconversion #deconstructingfaith #biblelies #atheist  #walkingawayfromreligion #freedomfromreligion #agnostic #freethinker #religionisascam #religionisbillshit #agnosticism\r\n\r\nThese videos aim to show what goes on in religion especially Christianity, as an ex-Christian.

      "description": "This is a highly anticipated conversation and i am so exited about this one as Dr. Leo is someone who is doing amazing work in Nigeria and Africa promoting free-thought, humanism, ending the stigma on witchcraft and helping the alleged victims of Witchcraft. \r\nLeo Igwe (born 26 July 1970) is a Nigerian human rights advocate and humanist. Igwe is a former Western and Southern African representative of the International Humanist and Ethical Union, and has specialized in campaigning against and documenting the impacts of child witchcraft accusations. He holds a Ph.D from the Bayreuth International School of African Studies at the University of Bayreuth in Germany, having earned a graduate degree in philosophy from the University of Calabar in Nigeria. Igwe\u0027s human rights advocacy has brought him into conflict with high-profile witchcraft believers, such as Liberty Foundation Gospel Ministries, because of his criticism of what he describes as their role in the violence and child abandonment that sometimes result from accusations of witchcraft.\r\n\r\nLeo Igwe was appointed as a research fellow of the James Randi Educational Foundation, where he continues working toward the goal of responding to what he sees as the deleterious effects of superstition, advancing skepticism throughout Africa and around the world. In 2014, he was chosen as a laureate of the International Academy of Humanism and in 2017 received the Distinguished Services to Humanism Award from the International Humanist and Ethical Union.\r\n\r\nDr. Igwe\u0027s human rights fieldwork has led to his arrest on several occasions in Nigeria. He has held leadership roles in the Nigerian Humanist Movement, Atheist Alliance International, and the Center For Inquiry\u2013Nigeria.\r\nIgwe has created teaching aids for teachers and primary school pupils on the topic of critical thinking. On 23 June 2021, he held his first workshop at Funmade Nursery and Primary School in Oyo State, southwest Nigeria. On 1 July, he presented the case for critical thinking in primary schools to fifty teachers in the Ibadan local government area of Nigeria. This was the first teacher training on critical thinking for primary schools in the state.\r\nIn 2022, Igwe founded an initiative that provides social and psychological support to non-religious former clergy in Africa. Named Ex-cellence Project, it is intended to correct misconceptions about leaving religion and resigning from clerical work, help individuals lead happy and meaningful lives outside of religion and clericalism, and provide a refuge for those who are physically and psychologically abused. The project aims to offer counselling and therapeutic programmes as well as a sense of community and belonging to members, regardless of their religious or clerical background\r\n\r\nIf you would like to support the Channel you can do so on \r\n\r\nCashApp: \u00A3africanhumanist\r\n\r\nPaypal: africanhumanistmum@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#theafrohumanist #christianity ~religion #deconversion #deconstructingfaith #biblelies #atheist #atheism #walkingawayfromreligion #freedomfromreligion #agnostic #freethinker #religionisascam #religionisbillshit #agnosticism",

Police said she suddenly went into heart failure at a station, fell on the floor, and died after two days in a coma.Eyewitnesses said she was beaten and her head hit the side of a police car, which in addition to her leaked medical scans,led others to diagnose cerebral hemorrhage and stroke.\nAmini\u0027s death resulted in a series of large scale protests across the country and garnered international attention including a statement from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, putting a focus on violence against women under the Islamic Republic of Iran. Several leaders, international organizations, and celebrities commented on the incident, condemning Iran\u0027s Morality Police for its treatment of women, and expressing solidarity with the protestors. The United States Department of the Treasury furthermore imposed sanctions on the Morality Police and Iranian leaders in various security organizations.\n\nIf you would like to support the Channel you can do so on \nCashApp: \u00A3africanhumanist\nPaypal: africanhumanistmum@gmail.com\n\n#theafrohumanist #christianity #deconversion #deconstructingfaith #biblelies #atheist #atheism #walkingawayfromreligion #freedomfromreligion #agnostic #freethinker #religionisascam #religionisbillshit #agnosticism\n\nThese aim to show what goes on in religion especially Cristianity being that I am an ex-Christian.

Islam limits the number of wives a Muslim man can have to four, mandating they must be all treated equally.  He married 120 wives, divorced 10, and fathered 203 children. At the time of his death in 2017, some of his wives were believed to be pregnant.[3]\r\n\r\nMasaba was a teacher and imam. He lived in an entire apartment block with his family. Masaba claimed that he never pursued his wives, and that he was sought by them due to his reputation as a healer. Most of his wives were younger than 30 years of age, and a few younger than his elder children. In interviews with Al Jazeera English, his wives claimed that he was a good husband and father.",

We were lied to, I hope to deconstruct the lies told to us in the bible , we don\u2019t deserve to be enslaved by that book anymore.

SPAC has been described as a form of prosperity gospel, believing that faith in god will bring material wealth.\r\nSPAC was a black-majority church, and most people that attend its Sunday services are under the age of 30. Sunday services are often held in various high-end locations, such as hotels, rather than a specific church building or location. In 2018, the church had a reported \u00A31.17m in income and \u00A31.19m in expenditure. This was a rise from \u00A3164,000 income reported in 2016\r\n\r\nIn 2018, it was reported the church had over 1000 members (in 2016, there were less than 300). In 2020, it was reported their congregation was up-to 2000. A 2019 report stated the church had been in-contact with 1200 people between the ages of 12-30. In 2022, it was reported that during an investigation by the Insolvency Service, it was found that SPAC failed to provide supporting evidence to the self-reported number of over 2000 members In December 2019, it was reported that SPAC operated across 12 London boroughs, as well as Leicester and Birmingham.\r\n\r\nIt has been the subject of multiple accusations of fraud and financial exploitation of members. The BBC reported in November 2020 that pastor and self-styled entrepreneur Mariam Mbula was a \u0022career con artist\u0022 who had been imprisoned in several European countries. According to the report, while SPAC Nation claims to be helping disadvantaged young people, former members said that its leaders, including Mbula, encourage young congregants to take out loans and give huge sums to the church. The police were carrying out a criminal investigation about allegations of fraud and other offences connected with people associated with SPAC Nation.",

Bishop Lamor Whitehead says five to ten minutes into the sermon, he saw the door in the back of the room kicked open and three to four men walked in with guns. He believes he was targeted, the station says. The service was being livestreamed.\r\n\r\n\u0022I said, \u0027Alright, alright, alright,\u0027 pretty much stating that I\u0027m not going to do anything because I know you\u0027re coming for me. You\u0027re coming straight to me. I don\u0027t want my parishioners hurt. I\u0027ve got women and children there,\u0022 said Whitehead, of Leaders of Tomorrow International Ministries.\r\n\r\n\u0022As I got down, one went to my wife and took all her jewelry and had the gun in front of my 8-month-old baby\u0027s face. Took off my bishop\u0027s ring, my wedding band and took off my bishop\u0027s chain, and then I had chains underneath my robe and he started tapping my neck to see if anything else. So that means they knew. They watched and they knew that I have other jewelry,\u0022 he explained. \r\nWhitehead believes his family was targeted because of the publicity he received when he helped turn in the suspect wanted in the fatal subway shooting of 48-year-old Daniel Enriquez in May. \r\n\r\n\u0022I turned him in, but the media called me \u0027the bling, bling bishop.\u0027 They had my Rolls-Royce caw all over everywhere, and I feel that that played a part in this,\u0022 said Whitehead. \u0022I think all pastors should be able to get permits for pistols.\u0022",

      "description": "Creflo Dollar, the American televangelist and and pastor of World Changers Church International, is offering a few edits to some of his past teaching on tithing. Dollar has been a frequent advocate for the prosperity gospel, teaching that God rewards faithful Christians with health and wealth, pointing to his own lavish net worth as proof. But now, he\u2019s backtracking on some of his former teaching.\r\n\r\n\u201CI want to start off by saying to you that I\u2019m still growing,\u201D Dollar preached in a June message called The Great Misunderstanding. \u201CAnd that the teachings that I\u2019ve shared in times past on the subject of tithing were not correct. And today, I stand in humility to correct some things that I\u2019ve taught for years and believed for years, but could never understand it clearly because I had not yet been confronted with the gospel of grace, which has made the difference.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not a full about face. Christian Headlines notes that Dollar isn\u2019t apologizing for his past teachings, nor is he fully backing down from prosperity teaching. \u201CI won\u2019t apologize because if it wasn\u2019t for me going down that route, I would\u2019ve never ended up where I am right now,\u201D he said. \u201CBut I will say that I have no shame at all at saying to you, throw away every book, every tape and every video I ever did on the subject of tithing unless it lines up with this.\u201D\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Pastor Adeboye says to his congregation \u201CMake it clear to them. Anyone who is not paying his tithe is not going to heaven. Full stop.\u201D",

The office was converted into a museum in 2002 and contains historical collections of the slave trade between Africa, Europe and North America.\r\n\r\nThe museum has one of the most comprehensive exhibitions on Transatlantic Slave Trade in West Africa. The Transatlantic Slave Trade started in Badagry in 1473 and ended in 1888. Badagry was part of the European Slave Coast exporting an average of 17,000 Slaves annually to the United States and The Caribbean Islands.

I submit myself to one authority \u2013 God,\u201D he said.\n\nMr. Edet was a Catholic priest for more than 11 years.\n\nAkwa Ibom, a predominantly Christian state, has a high Catholic population.\n\nIt is very rare in Nigeria to have a priest quit the Catholic Church.\n\nHe said he prayed and fasted for seven months before he took the decision to leave the Catholic Church.\n\nThe Catholic Church in the state could not be reached immediately for their comment on the matter.\n\nApart from being a radio preacher, Mr. Edet runs a crowd-pulling fellowship in Uyo, outside the control of the Catholic Church, using his Grace Family Global Outreach.\n\nThose who have attended the fellowship meetings before said things are done the Pentecostal style \u2013 like prophesying and \u201Cspeaking in tongue\u201D \u2013 which often brought the priest into conflict with the Catholic doctrine and leadership",

      "description": "South Carolina pastor of the Relentless Church John Gray has allegedly been busted having another affair and this time around, with an adult entertainer. Why can\u2019t these men of God practice whatever they preach to their congregants? Is it so difficult preaching what\u2019s in the scriptures? The popular South Carolina pastor of the Relentless Church has been accused of cheating multiple times \u2013 starting as far back as 2019. And Pastor Gray has admitted, in the past, to \u201Ccheating\u201D on his wife. But has also claimed that he\u2019s a reformed man.\n\nWell . . . he\u2019s back to cheating.\n\nGossip vlogger Tasha K claimed, in a new video, that Pastor John Gray has been caught having another affair, this time with an adult entertainer who provided Tasha with video proof of their liaison.\n\nPastor Gray first admitted to his cheating issues in an interview on The Real in March 2019. Pastor Gray said his affair was emotional, not physical. He claims that when he and his wife were having problems he went wrong by confiding in someone other than a counselor or a pastoral leader.\n\nDespite Gray\u2019s insistence that he did not physically cheat on his wife, however, there remains speculation that the affair was in fact more than emotional. I have no idea why Pastor John Gray doesn\u2019t get a divorce.\n\nNo one really cares to be honest and he will still get to scam the church.\n\nThis is like the 3rd or 4th time he has had to apologize for cheating. One time he had to get his wife a $200k Lambo with the churches\u2019 money to apologize. The last time he cheated because she wasn\u2019t cooking and just made pizza.\n\nIt is obvious my guy you don\u2019t want to be married just stop torturing yourself.\n\nhttps://blacksportsonline.com/2022/06/watch-pastor-john-gray-allegedly-caught-cheating-again-this-time-with-an-adult-entertainer/",

      "description": "A Nigerian politician and his wife have been charged with plotting to traffic a homeless 15-year-old boy to Britain to harvest his organs.\n\nIke Ekweremadu, 60, an opposition senator and former deputy senate president, and his wife, Beatrice Nwanneka Ekweremadu, 55, appeared at Uxbridge magistrates court in west London on Thursday.\n\nThe couple were arrested on Tuesday at Heathrow airport before they flew to Turkey, the court heard. Both deny the allegations.\n\nPolice said the boy, who the court was told was homeless, had been safeguarded.\n\nEkweremadu is an opposition senator in the southern Nigerian state of Enugu. He is also a principal at a law firm and has been influential in Nigerian politics for several decades.\n\nThe couple have been charged with conspiracy to arrange and/or facilitate travel of another person with a view to exploitation.\n\nThe prosecutor, Damla Ayas, said: \u201CIt is conspiracy in relation to human trafficking offences for the purposes of organ harvesting.\u201D\n\nThe prosecution told the court jurisdictional issues meant the attorney general\u2019s consent was required for the case to proceed. The couple were remanded in custody until their next court appearance on 7 July.\n\nAyas said: \u201CThey were interviewed at the police station. Both of the defendants have provided a prepared statement. Mr Ekweremadu in his prepared statement denied allegations of human trafficking. He said at no stage has he arranged transport for anyone with intention to exploit them.\u201D\n\nHis wife, an accountant, also denied the allegations in her prepared statement.\n\nThe investigation was launched by the Metropolitan police\u2019s specialist crime team after detectives were alerted to potential offences under modern slavery legislation in May. The charges relate to alleged activity between 1 August 2021 and 5 May 2022.",

One station said it would not run Roberts\u2019 message, while others said they will screen programs for such appeals before broadcasting them.\n\n\u2033The danger is not so much in the way funds are raised, but in that it can lead people to believe in a God that is manipulative,\u2033 said the Rev. Kent Ingram of the Boston Avenue Methodist Church, where Roberts is a registered member. \u2033He may not mean that, but that\u2019s what frightens me.\u2033\n\nThe ministry said $1.6 million in cash and pledges poured in within two weeks of Roberts\u2019 remarks Jan. 4.",

      "description": "Salvation Proclaimer Ministries Limited, more commonly known as SPAC Nation, was wound up in the public interest in the High Court on 9 June 2022 before Judge Burton. The Official Receiver has been appointed as liquidator of the company.\n\nThe court heard that SPAC Nation was incorporated in 2012, a charity set up to advance Christianity. Much of its charitable work was based in London, working particularly with vulnerable people, youth, and offenders.\n\nInitially, the church group received positive reviews and media attention. But by late 2019 SPAC Nation was subject to media scrutiny following allegations by former church members they had been financially exploited by senior church personnel.\n\nThe Insolvency Service received complaints about SPAC Nation before instigating its own confidential enquiries into the church group\u2019s activities.\n\nInvestigators interviewed one of the company\u2019s directors, Adedapo Olugbenga Adegboyega, who was also known as Dapo Adegboyega or Pastor Dapo. During interviews, Mr Adegboyega said that the church group had over 2,000 members and 200 ordained ministers and pastors but failed to provide any supporting information.\n\nFurther enquiries found that SPAC Nation either failed to comply or only partially complied with statutory requirements, including providing data to support claimed donations, and accounting records in support of \u00A31.87 million of expenditure.\n\nThe company\u2019s financial statements in the two years to 31 December 2019 set out \u00A3610,000 of rent expenditure. However, the company did not have a single base of its own and would hire venues across London to hold services, at significant expense.\n\nSalvation Proclaimer Ministries Limited was wound-up after the court concluded the company operated with a lack of transparency, filed suspicious or incorrect accounts, and was insolvent at the time of the hearing.\n\nIt was also recognised that the company provided inconsistent information to the Insolvency Service and Charity Commission, and failed to deliver up adequate accounting records\n\nThe company remains subject of a statutory inquiry by the Charity Commission, who are examining financial, governance and safeguarding matters at the charity.\n\nEdna Okhiria, Chief Investigator for the Insolvency Service, said:\n\nWhile SPAC Nation claimed it had noble intentions to support vulnerable and young people, our enquiries uncovered a different side of the charity. There were clear concerns around how the church group managed its affairs and SPAC Nation failed to properly account for income received from donations and other expenditure.\n\nThe court recognised the severity of SPAC Nation\u2019s actions and this sends a strong message that proper records and accounts must be maintained, even if you\u2019re a charity.\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/church-group-wound-up-in-court",

These pastors have lied, schemed and scammed their way to popularity, fame and wealth and it is time to expose their falsehood,  lies and deceit in Christianity over in Africa",

The three adults held the child by her legs, waist and neck and triggered her to vomit, saying that it would \u201Cget the spirit out,\u201D the outlet reported. The child\u2019s mother told investigators that she repeatedly stuck her hand down the child\u2019s throat. The ceremony went on for about 12 hours, leaving the girl with injuries around her eyes, face, neck and chest.\n\nThe girl\u2019s death by asphyxiation was ruled a homicide, and her mother was charged with assault on a child resulting in death, The Mercury News reported. The child\u2019s grandfather and uncle have not been charged in the girl\u2019s death, according to the outlet. The child\u2019s grandfather told The Mercury News that he felt a lot of pain about his granddaughter\u2019s death, but that \u201Cit\u2019s the stuff of God, and everything is in the will of God no matter how small or big.\u201D\n\nRead more at: https://www.sacbee.com/news/california/article261318582.html#storylink=cpy",

It was not 20 years \u2026 I was just 16 when you took my virginity on your office floor. Do you remember that? I know you do,\u201D the woman, now in her 40s, told Lowe.\n\n\u201CI lived in a prison of lies and pain. Lying to protect the Lowe family. I thought I was a horrible person having suicidal thoughts, not realizing what had truly been done to me,\u201D she said.\n\n\u201CThe church deserves to know the truth. This church has been built on lies, but no more. The lies need to stop,\u201D she said. The woman said her older brother recently confronted her about witnessing her lying in bed with their pastor while wearing a T-shirt and underwear when she was a teenager.\n\n\u201CYou did things to my teenage body that had never and should have never been done,\u201D she said. \u201CIf you can\u2019t admit to the truth, you have to answer to God. You are not the victim here. People knew but were too afraid to come forward.\n\n\u201CI was a prisoner, and you kept me in your prison. I\u2019m a prisoner no longer,\u201D the woman added before turning to Lowe\u2019s adult son and saying, \u201CYour dad is not the victim here \u2014 a partial truth is not true.\u201DWhen one congregant mentioned the age at which the woman said Lowe began his relationship with her, the pastor mumbled, \u201CSixteen years old, OK. It was wrong.\u201D\n\nThe woman\u2019s husband then confronted Lowe directly.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s not just adultery. It\u2019s another level when it\u2019s a teenager and I will not let this man talk about my wife like that. It happened for nine years \u2026 People have to be held accountable,\u201D he said, \n\n\u201CThey can\u2019t just bamboozle people and say, \u2018I just committed adultery.\u2019 It was far beyond adultery,\u201D he added.\n\n\nIf you would like to support the Channel while I wait to be monetized by YouTube you can do so on \nCashApp: \u00A3africanhumanist\nPaypal: africanhumanistmum@gmail.com",

      "description": "Deborah Samuel was a 19-year-old Christian from Tungan-Magajiya in the Rijau Local Government Area of Niger State. She was in her second year studying home economics at the Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto. \r\n\r\nDeborah was killed by a mob of her Muslim classmates who claimed she had blasphemed against the Prophet Muhammad. A video of this religious execution circulated online and sparked debates across the country on the limits of religious expression and why this murder was not being called a murder. \r\n\r\nOn Thursday the 12th of May 2022, Deborah Samuel was stoned, flogged and burnt to death in Sokoto after posting a message on the class group chat. According to a coursemate of the deceased, Deborah had been asked how she passed their examinations from last semester. Her response was \u201CJesus o.\u201D Three of her classmates didn\u2019t take too kindly to the religious response and requested that she retract the statement. Eventually, word got to Deborah\u2019s close friends on some Muslim boys who took the matter more seriously than expected, and they also tried to persuade her to retract the statement, but Deborah was unwavering. Her response to the request was this voice note. Here\u2019s a translation in English:\r\n\r\n\u201CHoly Ghost fire! There\u2019s nothing that will happen to us. Everything they\u2019re pushing to us is rubbish. It\u2019s not like they created the group to send reasonable information. If there\u2019s a test, or an assignment, they should put it on the group, not the rubbish they\u2019re sending. No be only prophet.\u201D\r\n\r\nThose were the words that led to the undeserving retaliation from her classmates and cheers from observers as she lay dying.",

      "description": "The phenomenon of witch-hunts in Sub-Saharan Africa is ancien, but the problem is reportedly \u0022on the rise\u0022, due to charismatic preachers and pastors as well as \u0022urbanization, poverty, conflict and fragmenting communities\u0022 Accusations of witchcraft in Africa are a very serious matter as the witch is culturally understood to be the epitome of evil and the cause of all misfortune, disease and death. Consequently, the witch is the most hated person in African society and subjected to punishment, torture and even death. The victims of witchcraft accusations in African societies have usually been the elderly, the disabled, albinos and anyone who was considered different.In recent years due to the impact of rapid urbanisation, economic decline, as well as the HIV/AIDS pandemic, children have become more and more the victims of witchcraft accusations, especially orphans.\n\nChild victims of witchcraft accusations are more vulnerable than adult victims as they cannot defend themselves as they are confronted with physical and psychological abuse from their family and community.\n\nThe sheer scale and intenseness of the recent witch-hunts targeting children classifies as unprecedented in written history.\n\n\u2014\u2009Ethnologist Felix Riedel\n\nChildren accused of witchcraft may be subjected to violent exorcism rituals by African Pentecostal-Charismatic pastors who mix Christianity with African witchcraft beliefs. Such exorcism may include incarceration, starvation, being made to drink hazardous substances or even being set on fire with gasoline.In other cases accused children are expelled and end up living on the streets, are trafficked and in some instances they are killed.",

The pastor conducting the conversion therapy is Named Belema Abili and she runs a Christian online ministry/church named Princess Belemzy Ministries, this family are in serious trouble in this ministry. The grandma has been accused falsely of being a witch/demon and she could be in some serious trouble because older women have been beaten and killed for accusation of being witches. This 17 year old young man is my primary concern as his religious parents and pastor instead of letting him live his true identity would rather perform conversion therapy and stop him being who he truly is. This is rather unfortunate and needs to be called out for the evil that go on in some churches.\n\n#conversiontherapy #religion #leavingchristianity #deconversion #atheism #atheist #belemaabili #deconversionstories #jesusisamyth #jesuschrist #jesus religionistoxic #ffrf #freedomfromreligion",

On April 28, 2020, Bala was arrested in Kano, a predominantly Muslim state in northern Nigeria, in connection with a Facebook post that authorities alleged violated Section 26(1)(c) of the Cybercrimes Act by insulting the Prophet Muhammed and being \u201Cprovocative and annoying to Muslims.\u201D To date, Bala has not been officially charged with any crime\u2014a clear violation of his rights under the Nigerian Constitution as ruled by the Federal High Court of Abuja on December 21, 2020.\nYet, today, over 600 days have passed of Mubarak Bala\u2019s continued illegal detention in Kano State.\nIn Nigeria, atheists and ex-Muslims are labeled as \u201Capostates\u201D whose very existence is considered blasphemous\u2014making extremist Islamists a serious threat to atheists. Likewise, Nigeria\u2019s parallel court systems, civil and Sharia, both criminalize speech that insults religion. States utilizing Sharia courts, like Kano where Bala is detained, don\u2019t specifically rule on cases involving non-Muslims, but they do interpret customary laws, which are carried over to the secular courts. With \u201Capostasy\u201D and \u201Cblasphemy\u201D both prohibited, atheists and humanists alike face social persecution and prohibitive social taboos.\nAs a humanist and ex-Muslim, Mubarak Bala is a source of contention for the twelve Muslim-majority northern states of Nigeria. His troubles began when he renounced his Islamic faith in 2014. Renouncing one\u2019s Islamic faith in Nigeria is a forbidden act, a dishonor to the family, and a crime punishable by death in its Sharia courts. It\u2019s such a taboo that Bala\u2019s own family consigned him to a mental hospital over the matter. Given these past infringements on his rights, his current detention for the Facebook post raised serious concerns for his safety.\nBala\u2019s legal team worked tirelessly filing a Fundamental Rights petition on May 8th, 2020 with the Federal High Court in Abuja. The petition called for his release on the grounds that the detention violates his rights to liberty, a fair trial, freedom of thought and expression, and freedom of movement under the Nigerian Constitution and international human rights law. However, it\u2019s been an uphill battle trying to protect Bala. The legal team was denied access to meet with him by the Kano State authorities for the first five months of his detention. Nor would authorities confirm whether he was even in their custody. The legal team sought a court order demanding access to Bala, but the police commissioner refused, contending without merit that the order didn\u2019t grant any access. It wasn\u2019t until a rumor of his death began circulating that the legal team was granted access to Bala on October 2, 2020. During this meeting, the legal team learned Bala was receiving death threats from others in the jail. This raised serious concerns for the safety of Bala, his wife, and his daughter. Bala\u2019s Facebook account was also riddled with similar threats.\nThe hearing for the Fundamental Rights petition was delayed twice, first at the hearing stage and then again for the final verdict. Thus, despite the May 8th filing and the concerns for his safety, it wasn\u2019t until December 21, 2020 that the Federal High Court in Abuja delivered its verdict ruling that Bala\u2019s detention was illegal and ordering his immediate release. This long-awaited ruling offered a glimmer of hope for his family and supporters. After over 600 days in confinement, even with a verdict demanding his release, no one can say for sure how much longer Mubarak Bala will remain in Kano custody. It is important to continue raising awareness and advocating for his release. Another day spent incarcerated is another day Bala\u2019s life is threatened merely for the peaceful exercise of his rights to freedom of expression, religion, and belief.\n\n\nhttps://thehumanist.com/news/international/mubarak-bala-the-300-day-campaign/",

      "description": "I went along to Aron Ra\u0027s Youtube chaneel and asked this question and who best to answer other than a bible scholar, Francesca Stavrakopoulou is a  Professor of the Hebrew Bible and Ancient Religion at the University of Exeter. A leading expert in religion\u2019s interpretations of the past and influence on modern attitudes, Francesca\u2019s research is primarily focused on ancient Israelite and Judahite religions, and portrayals of religious history in the Hebrew Bible. She is also interested in biblical traditions and religious practices most at odds with Western cultural values. Her scrupulous and sensitive reading of religious textual history has promoted a subtler and more nuanced understanding of the ancient human societies which produced religious texts, and has helped to shed light on how interpretations of these texts have changed over time, and the symbiotic relationship these texts have with prevailing attitudes in society.\n\nFrancesca studied Theology at the University of Oxford, where she also completed her doctorate. She spent a further three years teaching and researching in Oxford, first as a Junior Research Fellow and then as the Career Development Fellow in the Faculty of Theology, before joining Exeter\u2019s Department of Theology and Religion in 2005.\nhttps://youtu.be/JRHBL-ThTRk",

      "description": "Last week, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) revealed a shocking amount of evidence concerning widespread child abuse in religious settings in England and Wales. Sexual abuse, victim blaming, abuse of power, hypocrisy, moral failings, and an atrocious lack of safeguarding \u2013 the behaviour revealed in the 226-page report is contemptible.\n\nThe inquiry explains that there are at least 250,000 children attending religious out-of-school settings in England, and that a substantial number of these are so-called \u2018unregistered schools\u2019, also known as illegal schools. The report outlines how these settings are rife with child sexual exploitation and other abuse, with the lack of any regulatory oversight meaning abusers can easily get away with it.\n\nIn our seven years of leading the campaign against illegal schools, this is the most serious report we\u2019ve ever seen. The report should serve as a wake-up call. For far too long the UK Government has been mulling over how to shut down these illegal faith schools. In the meantime, thousands of children remain at risk. The Department for Education should bring forward legislation as a matter of urgency.\n\nWe lead the national campaign for action on unregistered religious schools. Children deserve safe learning environments, qualified teachers, and an education beyond the rote learning of scripture. \n\nhttps://humanists.uk/2021/09/02/child-sexual-abuse-inquiry-raises-serious-alarm-about-illegal-schools/",

      "description": "Victoria Adjo Climbi\u00E9 (2 November 1991 \u2013 25 February 2000), was a child who was tortured and murdered by her great-aunt and her boyfriend. Her death led to a public inquiry and produced major changes in child protection policies in the United Kingdom.\n\nBorn in Abobo, C\u00F4te d\u2019Ivoire, Climbi\u00E9 left the country with her great-aunt Marie-Th\u00E9r\u00E8se Kouao, a French citizen who later abused her, for an education in France where they travelled before arriving in London in April 1999. It is not known exactly when Kouao started abusing Climbi\u00E9, although it is suspected to have worsened when Kouao and Climbi\u00E9 met and moved in with Carl Manning, who became Kouao\u0027s boyfriend. During the abuse, Climbi\u00E9 was burnt with cigarettes, tied up for periods of longer than 24 hours, and hit with bike chains, hammers and wires.Kouao and Manning were convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison \nThe pastor told the inquiry into the death of eight-year-old Victoria Climbie that he thought she was possessed by evil spirits when he saw her wounds.\nPastor Pascal Orome said he did not suspect Victoria - killed in one of Britain\u0027s worst child abuse cases - was being abused despite seeing her torture injuries.\n\nShe was taken to his church in Borough, south-east London, by her great aunt Marie Therese Kouao, who was one of her killers. After one service at the Mission Ensemble Pour Christ Church, he went over to Victoria and said a prayer, telling her: \u0022You are delivered from witchcraft or wicked spirits.\u0022\n\nMr Orome, who has been preaching for two years told the hearing that Victoria \u0022was the first time I see such a problem of evil spirits in a child of seven or eight\u0022. He said he did not believe Kouao was abusing Victoria although he did think it was strange that Victoria was always poorly dressed in comparison to Kouao.\n\nThe child\u0027s great aunt also told him that Victoria - who she claimed was her daughter and called Anna - was incontinent, put excrement into food, burned herself and made a mess at home.\n\nThese were all activities which provided evidence that she was possessed, the pastor said.",

I use the power of the dead to heal other people. And to be able to do that, I have to marry to get power and also to avoid punishment from my elders,\u201D she said This is what led her into polyandry, and she is currently a mother-of-six, and yet to give birth for her recent husband.\n\nInterestingly, Allman said her husbands live in harmony, each with his own house that she built for them prior to their marriage.\n\nOn how she satisfies them sexually, she said she is the only person that has the power to demand sex, and she chooses who she craves for.\n\n\u201CI satisfy all of them from time to time. None of them has ever complained and none will dare cheat because the elders will reveal it to me in a vision before it happens,\u201D she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.myjoyonline.com/woman-with-7-husbands-shares-details-of-her-marriage-life/",

When he was caught red-handed he started to shout Jesus Jesus Jesus as if he was expecting Jesus to come and rescue him but he was handcuffed and taken away by the police. The reason why this video is on my channel is because when he was caught in the act he thought Jesus will come and save him but why did Jesus tell him not to do this? He needs to take responsibility for his actions and stop calling on Jesus and this is the problem religious people need to start taking ownership for their actions",

      "description": "According to history we all know that Jesus apparently originated from the middle east so why on earth were Africans made to believe that Jesus was white Caucasian? Whose idea was it to lie to Africans and why? At this point Africa needs to wake up and realise that we have been lied to and the question is, if  they could lie about his ethnicity what else could they be lying about? If you believe in a religion that tells you lies then it is your duty to find out the truth. Why the lies?",

      "description": "The lady in this video is identified as Pastor Cecilia, she went on the rampage with her members because they didn\u2019t contribute towards her birthday. She told them that God will punish them for not contributing towards her birthday, she also said that they are all about themselves because they have money in their accounts and refuse to give to them. She went further to tell her members that whatever money they donate is for food that they will eventually eat when they come to the party and that some of them will eat like pigs at the party and even take some away with them. She told her members that some of them disturb her with their request for prayers and that they are selfish And they have the wisdom of the world. She said no wonder some Pastors are bitter for this reason but she isn\u2019t because her husband takes care of all her needs, if her husband does take care of her needs then why do you need to get angry with the members for not contributing towards your birthday. This is crazy and this lady needs to understand that being a pastor is about sacrifices and being selfless and she needs to be called out for verbally abusing her members and shame on her for doing so. The members of this church need to run away from abuse and realise also that religion is poisonous and toxic and this is a clear example of this.",

      "description": "Reverend King aka Chukwuemeka Ezeugo, is a Christian preacher from Anambra State, South-east Nigeria.In 2006, he rose to nationwide recognition following the murder of a church member, Ann Uzoh. He was subsequently sentenced to death in January 2007,and his conviction was upheld by the Supreme Court of Nigeria on 26 February 2016. \n\nOn the pastor\u0027s birthday, Some of his members sang hymns, danced and hailed their hero. Every word of King is met with admiration. Some even made the same hairstyle as the reverend and took the surname King. During the trial, it became known that he beat up and burnt 7 persons. He just poured oil on these people and set them on fire like a bunch of firewood. One woman even reported that after numerous seductions by the man, she got pregnant and had to abort several times. For him, this was a kind of educational method for eradicating disobedience. It is outrageous to think that such things still happen in a modern civilized world. But these are not all the sins of the cruel pastor. He also hired a woman as a slave. She had to serve him. And nakedness was the only way she could do that. It also became known that the pastor had intimate relations with female guests even while in prison. \nRead more: https://www.legit.ng/1122880-story-rev-king-nigeria.html\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wuXa3Ak9Uhk\n\nhttps://youtu.be/1zDl7Hmfch0",

When she became ill, her family and friends decided that her illness was because of her comedy routines poking holes in religious leaders operations. It is sad for people to assume that being ill is because of something that you have said or done, people have died because of the assumption that they spoke about a pastor or prophet when this is not the case.

      "description": "This is the case of this pastor who described a story whereby his member was given a message from God and he lived in Germany but the message was to the church in France and he didn\u2019t have the proper documentation to travel but somehow God ordered the man go to the airport stand in the queue, and when it was nearly his turn God told him to go to the toilet, sit on the toilet in Germany and somehow he found himself at the toilets in France. He gave his message and then went back through the toilets back to Germany. This story is ridiculous and how anyone believes it is beyond me,Most importantly this would be considered a crime because you are entering a country illegally when you could simply have picked up the phone and called up the pastors and delivered your message. So this is me debunking this story",

Charity Commision has appointed an interim Manager into the shady dealings of this church. As a Humanist, such a church needs to be looked further into because they were found to be offering conversion therapy which the Prime Minister Boris Johnson considered it an abhorrent practice.
