      "description": "Cults are small groups of people (sometimes even toxic family members) who have a common belief system, feel interconnected or \u0022close,\u0022 and may believe in the same principles, religion, or cultural morays, who strives to control and manipulate your mind. \n\nToxic family members may have a \u0022cult-like\u0022 mentality and a series of behaviors that can make you feel overpowered, undermined, and abused. \n\nHaving a \u0022cult-like\u0022 mindset can lead to codependency, traumatic bonding, and intense fear of independence. \n\nIn this video, I discuss the psychology of family, religious, and spiritual cults and how they negatively impact your adult relationships and mind over time.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#trauma #TOXICFAMILY\n#tamarahilllpc\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDISCUSSED IN THIS VIDEO:\n0:00 intro\n2:12 cult leaders 101\n3:00 behaviors of cult leaders and what they do\n5:00 submissiveness \n7:00 WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU\n9:00 HOW CULT LEADERS TAKE OVER YOUR MIND\n15:05 Cognitive Theory (thoughts, feelings, behaviors)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nMentioned In The Video:\n1.Festinger, L.

      "description": "What do you know about satanic ritual abuse?\n\nHave you ever heard of it?\n\nIn this video, I explore the topic (only touching the surface) and explain a few signs you may be in a dangerous and traumatic religious cult.\n\nThere is also often a strong correlation of suicide to dangerous and traumatic religious cults. In fact, research suggests that suicide-contagion may be associated with a cult-like mindset. \n\nIn 1974 a religious sect group was formed by Marshall Applewhite and Bonnie Nettles. Heaven\u0027s Gate was a religious cult based out of San Diego, California and included about 39 members. The group\u0027s \u0022mission\u0022 was to identify UFO\u0027s and engage in extreme self-reunification which resulted in castration. The group existed under a variety of names over the years as if it wanted to hide and escape ever being truly found out. The only notoriety the group received was after the 39 members committed suicide in a suburban area of San Diego in March of 1997. News reports and studies that include the history of this\ngroup report that both Applewhite and Nettles believed they were the\nwitnesses mentioned in the book of Revelations (Revelations chapter 11)\nin the Bible. \n\nScary case!
