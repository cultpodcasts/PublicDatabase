      "description": "What do you know about satanic ritual abuse?\n\nHave you ever heard of it?\n\nIn this video, I explore the topic (only touching the surface) and explain a few signs you may be in a dangerous and traumatic religious cult.\n\nThere is also often a strong correlation of suicide to dangerous and traumatic religious cults. In fact, research suggests that suicide-contagion may be associated with a cult-like mindset. \n\nIn 1974 a religious sect group was formed by Marshall Applewhite and Bonnie Nettles. Heaven\u0027s Gate was a religious cult based out of San Diego, California and included about 39 members. The group\u0027s \u0022mission\u0022 was to identify UFO\u0027s and engage in extreme self-reunification which resulted in castration. The group existed under a variety of names over the years as if it wanted to hide and escape ever being truly found out. The only notoriety the group received was after the 39 members committed suicide in a suburban area of San Diego in March of 1997. News reports and studies that include the history of this\ngroup report that both Applewhite and Nettles believed they were the\nwitnesses mentioned in the book of Revelations (Revelations chapter 11)\nin the Bible. \n\nScary case!
