      "description": "\uD83D\uDCC4 Livestream Description:\n\n\u26A0\uFE0F TRIGGER WARNING: This livestream discusses allegations of child sexual abuse and institutional cover-ups. Viewer discretion is advised.\n\nJoin Kresha Kay Easton on @DifficultResearch for a powerful and urgent livestream today, September 7, 2025, at 10 AM CDT, featuring special guest Justin Riggs from @LDSAbuse.\n\nTogether, we\u0027ll peel back the layers of a decades-old child sex abuse case in Bountiful, Utah, where allegations point to a disturbing cover-up involving high-ranking LDS Church leaders.\n\nAt the center of this case are Brenda and Dick Miles, the daughter and son-in-law of Russell M. Nelson, the current prophet of the Mormon Church. Plaintiffs allege horrific abuse dating back to the 1980s, claiming church leaders used their influence to suppress the truth and silence victims.\n\nThis livestream will also connect the dots between this case and other high-profile scandals, including:\n\n * The Daybell Case: Examining the alleged connections and the wider network of individuals involved in the killings and conspiracies.\n *Thom Harrison: Author of Visions of Glory and retired child sexual abuse therapist. Cofounder of EternalCore with Ken Krogue of InsideSales.com. \n * Tim Ballard\u0027s Network: Looking at the various organizations under his leadership, such as Operation Underground Railroad, The Nazarene Fund, and others.\n * Jodi Hildebrandt \u0026 Ruby Franke: Discussing the child abuse case and its ties to extreme ideological circles.\n * David Hamblin: Highlighting the allegations of ritualistic abuse and institutional secrecy.\n * Julie Rowe: Investigating her role and influence within the broader landscape of religious and political figures who may be leveraging their positions for personal gain.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about one case\u2014it\u2019s about a pattern of institutional silence, power, and pain that extends to the highest levels.\n\n\uD83D\uDC94 Violent crime is indiscriminate. Its devastating impact extends to every aspect of our daily lives. The effects of violent crime are long-lasting, leaving a lasting legacy on the memories of victims and the survivors who must carry this burden for the rest of their lives. Thank you so much for your love and support! I couldn\u0027t do this without you!\n\n\n\uD83D\uDCCCA short bio on Justin Riggs:\n * X (formerly Twitter): @ldsabuse\n\nJustin Riggs is an investigative researcher, journalist, and founder of the platform LDS Abuse. He holds a master\u0027s degree in Adult Education and Training and uses his platform to act as a whistleblower against institutional abuse. He was a lifelong member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints until his excommunication earlier this year, an action that was taken due to his work exposing systemic problems within the church.\n\nRiggs\u0027s research and reporting have uncovered what he alleges are hidden connections between the church and the CIA, and have revealed a systemic issue of ritual abuse. He emphasizes that his findings are supported by verifiable evidence and have been corroborated by numerous victim testimonies. Riggs believes the Church, as a corporation, prioritizes protecting its brand over the well-being of its members and abuse victims. His goal is not to tear down the church, but to eradicate the systemic abuse that has persisted with little public scrutiny.\n\n\uD83D\uDD17 Connect \u0026 Support\n * Email: kresha0123@gmail.com\n\n * PayPal: paypal.me/difficultresearch\n\n * Venmo: @kreshakay\n\n * Subscribe to my YouTube channel for free: https://youtube.com/c/difficultresearch/ \n\n * Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/difficultresearch/\n\n * Substack: https://substack.com/difficultresearch/\n\n * Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/c/difficultresearch/\n\n * X (formerly Twitter): @Kresha_Kay\n \n* Difficult Research Merch Store: \n\n\nWant to create live streams like this?

      "description": "In this special collaboration with @Joe Schmoe on YouTube, we\u0027re discussing the groundbreaking lawsuit against The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints concerning its clergy-penitent privilege. A recent court ruling in Arizona, delivered by Judge Laura Cardinal, has stated that the church cannot refuse to answer questions or turn over records in a child sex abuse case, a decision that could set a major legal precedent.\n\nWe\u0027ll be diving deep into the Paul Adams case, where two bishops and church leaders are accused of negligence for not reporting abuse. The core issue is whether a confession of abuse is protected by confidentiality, even after the abuser posted videos of his crimes online. This case brings to light the church\u0027s use of a \u0022help line\u0022 that critics say can divert abuse accusations away from law enforcement and to church attorneys.\n\nJoin us as we explore the legal, ethical, and moral implications of this ruling. We\u0027ll be breaking down the arguments from both sides and discussing what this could mean for the future of child protection policies and the church\u0027s accountability.\n\nProposed Hashtags:\n#LDSChurch #Mormon #ChildAbuse #ClergyAbuse #ClergyPrivilege #LDSNews #JoeSchmoe #Lawsuit #ChurchAccountability #JudgeLauraCardinal #PaulAdams #ClergyPenitentPrivilege\n\nThis video discusses a lawsuit against the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the legal challenges to its clergy-penitent privilege.\nJudge limits privilege defense in AZ Mormon sex abuse case:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsnRA11c7pY\n\nWant to create live streams like this?

      "description": "On November 1, 2019, Melani Boudreaux Pawlowski and her uncle Alex Cox continuously (imo) harassed Brandon and Claudia Ewell (friends of her and her estranged husband at the time, Brandon Boudreaux) in an attempt to obtain custody of their four children who were in danger of possibly having the same fate as their cousins, Tylee Ryan and JJ Vallow, who disappeared in September of 2019 from Rexburg, Idaho and were later found dead on Chad Daybell\u2019s Salem Idaho property after a 9 month search for their whereabouts. This police interview is now that much more alarming because of details that were revealed in the Idaho trials that Chad and Lori had also rated two of the Boudreaux children as being \u201Cdark.\u201D There\u2019s no telling what might have happened had Melani been able to get her children that day. Like Summer Shiflet said in an interview when referring to the incident involving her brother Alex Cox in the shooting death of my uncle Charles Vallow on July 11, 2019, that had Alex not been there that day, (to \u201Cprotect Lori\u201D) perhaps Tylee and JJ would\u2019ve been on the news for a much different reason. Something close to what she said. I reciprocate the sentiment. \n\n#charlesvallow #truecrimecommunity #arizonatrial #alexcox #chaddaybell #justiceforcharlesvallow #update #arizona #trial #doomsdaymom #brandonboudreaux #melaniboudreaux  #melanipawlowski #crime #ewells #GilbertPolice #investigation",

      "description": "Friends, family, and members of the public,\n\nTomorrow, the first pitch will be thrown in the state of Arizona as opening statements commence in the case against Lori Vallow Daybell. This day marks a significant milestone in my journey to hold her accountable for the devastating ambush and murder of my beloved uncle, Charles Vallow.\n\nOn July 11, 2019, Charles stepped up to the plate, expecting to be at the rental house he so generously provided for Lori \u2013 a home intended to foster stability for his children, JJ Vallow and Tylee Ryan, young lives tragically cut short by Lori\u2019s heinous actions, for which she has already been convicted.\n\nBut instead of a routine visit, my uncle was blindsided, ambushed at home plate by Lori\u2019s own brother. This was no accidental hit-by-pitch; this was a calculated fastball aimed directly at taking him out of the game of life.\n\nAnd let us not forget Tammy Daybell, another innocent life stolen, the wife of Lori\u2019s current husband, Chad Daybell, the doomsday fanatic now sitting on death row in Idaho for his role in these very same murders. While Chad\u2019s stench lingers over this entire ordeal, and while he should also face scrutiny for any involvement in my uncle\u2019s death, my focus today, and tomorrow, remains squarely on Lori Vallow Daybell. He\u2019s not even worth a bench-clearing brawl\u2019s attention right now.\n\nMy uncle Charles was a true team player, a kind, humble, and caring man who loved his wife, cherished their blended family, bled silver and blue for his Dallas Cowboys, and found joy in the crack of the bat and the slide into home. He often spoke of life in terms of baseball, and today, as we step into this courtroom, we carry his spirit with us.\n\nTomorrow, the prosecution will step up to the mound, ready to throw strike one in laying out the evidence of Lori Vallow Daybell\u2019s guilt in my uncle\u2019s death. We have been in the on-deck circle for far too long, waiting for our chance to see justice served.\n\nWe believe that the evidence will be irrefutable, each witness a solid hit, each piece of testimony another runner advancing. And in the end, we are confident that the truth will cross the plate, delivering a grand slam for justice. Lori Vallow Daybell will be found guilty.\n\nAs my uncle Charles always said, \u0022Love Always Wins.\u0022 And tomorrow, we take a crucial step towards ensuring that his love and his memory prevail over the darkness that took him from us\n\n#LoveAlwaysWins #CharlesVallow #LoriVallowDaybell #DoomsdayCultMom #LoriVallow #LoriDaybell #OpeningStatements #ArizonaTrial #Live #TrueCrime\n\nWant to create live streams like this?

      "description": "Just Hours Before Trial: My Aunt Lori Vallow Daybell\u0027s Exclusive Interview - LIVE Reaction!\n\nThe Daybell trial starts Monday, and Lori Vallow Daybell just gave an exclusive interview on AZ Family! Join me LIVE for my immediate reactions and analysis of what she said. This is happening right now \u2013 let\u0027s discuss the implications as we stand on the eve of a major trial. Going live @11:00am CDT (10:00am MDT/9:00am Pacific). \n\nIn this interview, Lori talks about the following: \n\n\u2022 Decision to Represent Herself\n\u2022 Experiences in Jail\n\u2022 Fighting for Other Inmates\n\u2022 MUTED at the request of attorney\n\u2022 Challenges of Self-Representation\n\nLori also claims she has been falsely convicted over the kids and Tammy\u2019s deaths and that she had a good life with Charles. She also claims that God put her in jail for a purpose and it is to help other female inmates who are also fighting for their lives in prison. A repetitive pattern is that she insists that the killing of my uncle and I assume the kids are just tragedies, NOT crimes! I\u2019d move to say that Lori is a Tragedy Pimp and creates the very thing she calls \u201COpposition\u201D or \u201Cadversarial\u201D because she is the only reason she is in this position in the first place. \n\n\n#LoriVallowTrial #LoriDaybellTrial #CultMom #ExclusiveInterview #BreakingTrueCrime #TrialCountdown #JJandTyleeForever #LiveNow #JusticeForCharlesVallow\n\nWant to create live streams like this?

      "description": "Glenn L. Pace was a Presiding Bishop in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This means he held a high-ranking position within the church\u2019s leadership, responsible for overseeing the church\u2019s temporal affairs, including finances, welfare, and real estate. \n\nIn the early 1990\u2019s, Pace was tasked by the First Presidency (the highest governing body of the church) to investigate claims of ritualistic abuse within the church. These claims, often involving allegations of satanic rituals, sexual abuse, and psychological manipulation, were deeply concerning to church leaders at that time. What ever came of it? \n\nThis is why I think it is so important to share with you that I am of the strong opinion that this is what spilled over into my own family\u2019s murders in 2019. I don\u2019t think this issue was ever addressed and as a result, here we are today, with the same issue raging in not only the Vallow/Daybell case, but also in the Hamblin Case, the Franke-Hildebrandt case and many more cases that perhaps we should consider as well.

Don\u0027t forget to subscribe, like, and comment to receive notifications for my new content, and your support helps me grow!\n\nA Controversial Visionary\n\nHello, and welcome to my channel! Today, we\u0027re diving into the intriguing world of Julie Rowe, a self-proclaimed visionary whose influence has sparked both fascination and controversy within the Mormon (LDS) community.\n\nIn 2020, I discovered a 69-page PDF crafted by a member of the Mormon church. This individual undertook the substantial task of compiling the document to monitor Julie\u0027s activities on the LDS AVOW website (Another Voice of Warning) and to delve into the history and context surrounding Julie Rowe\u0027s involvement in the Latter-day Saints movement.\n\nJulie Rowe emerged as a prominent figure in the LDS cultural landscape through her claims of near-death experiences and prophetic visions. Her books and speaking engagements garnered a significant following, as she shared her insights and predictions about future events. \n\nConnections with Influential Figures\nRowe\u0027s connections with figures like Chad Daybell, Thom Harrison, and Tim Ballard have further fueled public interest. Each of these individuals has been notable in their own right, and their interactions with Rowe have sparked conversations and debates within the community.\n\nAs we explore Julie Rowe\u0027s impact, it\u0027s essential to recognize the cultural revolution she helped ignite within the LDS community. Her ideas and teachings have challenged traditional beliefs, prompting both support and criticism. While some view her as a spiritual guide,\nothers see her influence in a more controversial light.\n\nIn this video, we\u0027ll delve into how Julie Rowe\u0027s visionary claims have been perceived. We\u0027ll examine the dual nature of her influence-how she has inspired many to seek deeper spiritual understanding, while also raising questions about the reliability and impact of her predictions.\n\n\nJoin us as we explore the captivating story of Julie Rowe, her connections, and the cultural shifts she has inspired. Whether you\u0027re familiar with her work or hearing about her for the first time, this journey promises to be both enlightening and thought-provoking. Don\u0027t forget to like, subscribe, and hit the notification bell to stay updated on our latest content!\n\nAs we seek justice, we remember those we\u0027ve lost.

Your insights are phenomenal and valuable to the community. She read Melanie Gibb\u2019s book recently (and will be reading Visions of Glory the next time) and she pointed out quite a few things that I never knew about until now.

Let her know @DiffiCULT Research (Kresha Easton or JJ\u2019s aunt) sent you). \r\n\r\nWe will discuss a major topic that Melanie wrote in her book that may very well pertain to Joe Ryan and of course, the notorious Mormon Pro Se defendant, Lori Vallow Daybell. We will also continue our research into my uncle, Charles Vallow\u2019s Arizona Conspiracy Cases regarding as well as Brandon Boudreaux\u2019s.

      "description": "Late Night Live! Analyzing Julie Rowe...Through a Fellow Member\u0027s Report\r\nLet\u2019s delve into this comprehensive analysis authored by a concerned member of the LDS Church, who, like many others, expressed skepticism about Julie Rowe\u2019s intentions and authenticity upon her emergence in the Mormon community. This member compiled a detailed 69-page PDF report that examines Julie\u2019s involvement in the intriguing forum known as AVOW (Another Voice of Warning, ran by Christopher Parrett).\r\n\r\nThis same LDS church member provided an in-depth examination that sheds more light on Julie Rowe and her purported near-death experiences. They raised questions about whether Julie was genuinely deceived or, perhaps, intentionally misleading others. Join me in exploring this unique opportunity as we uncover the truths surrounding Julie Rowe.\r\n\r\nIn Their Honor,\r\n-As we seek justice, we remember those we\u0027ve lost.

      "description": "The lawsuit has drawn significant attention, as it involves serious allegations against Tim Ballard, the founder of Operation Underground Railroad (O.U.R.), a well-known non-profit organization who touted about his dedication to combating human trafficking. In response, the Utah Attorney General\u0027s office has emphasized its commitment to thoroughly reviewing the claims and ensuring that justice is served, and in my opinion, perhaps that can finally be done once Reyes is out of office (in the near future). The Attorney General stated that while these allegations are concerning, it is important to allow the legal process to unfold without jumping to conclusions.\n\n#seanreyes #utah #attorneygeneral #statement #timballard #operationundergroundrailroad #our #soundoffreedom #federallawsuit #homelandsecurityinvestigation #criminalinvestigation #whiteboardmeeting #lynnpacker #janetrusson #kenkrogue #thomharrison #lorivallow #chaddaybell #spearfund",

The filing names Ballard associates Matthew Cooper and Michael Porenta, as well as Ballard\u2019s former organization, Operation Underground Railroad (OUR), as defendants. OUR forced out the founder and CEO shortly before Sound of Freedom amplified his celebrity, due to internal complaints of sexual misconduct. A lawyer for Ballard denies the allegations.

This intriguing footage features notable figures such as Oprah, The Clinton Foundation, Sean Reyes, Terry Cruz, Mia Love, Ellen DeGeneres, Tony Robbins, and many others, sparking conversations about their roles and connections within this complex narrative. Not to mention recent allegations from #diddy #seancombs\r\nSince the allegations surrounding Operation Underground Railroad have surfaced, particularly those reported by Utah journalist Lynn Packer, key figure Tim Ballard has strongly denied any wrongdoing. He has proposed various alternative theories to counter these claims. In a recent statement through the SPEAR Fund, an anti-trafficking organization he seems to have spearheaded, Ballard suggests the involvement of other individuals while describing the allegations as \u0022baseless.\u0022 He emphasizes the strict guidelines he implemented at O.U.R., asserting that any implication of inappropriate conduct is categorically false.\r\nAs we analyze this groundbreaking video and discuss its implications, we invite you to join the conversation and share your thoughts.

The judge denied a request to allow video or still photographers in the courtroom and the hearing was not livestreamed on his YouTube channel.\n\nDaybell said nothing during the hearing as he appeared via Zoom from the Idaho Maximum Security Institution in Boise wearing a dark green jumpsuit.\n\nThomas listed multiple reasons why more time is needed to effectively file for post-conviction relief, which is a process wherein a defendant asks the court to vacate or modify a judgment of conviction, or to reduce or modify a sentence.\n\nThe last hearing on the matter:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/awgstDTF5pY?si=iKKGCBfeLJRiaPD3",

      "description": "Khouri Richins Preliminary Hearing-Day One\r\n\r\nA Utah mom who wrote a grief book for (her) chilldren, Khoiuri Richins is accused of poisoning her husband Eric Richins. Today, the judge will hear from 3-4 witnesses, which could span into tomorrow, to see if there is enough evidence to forward to a jury trial. \n\r\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s status hearing, it was revealed prosecutors intend to call four or five witnesses throughout the preliminary hearing. The defense meanwhile plans to call one or two witnesses.\n\r\nRichins is scheduled to appear in a multi-day preliminary hearing starting Monday morning, Aug. 26. She faces a first-degree felony aggravated murder charge and attempted criminal homicide among other charges of drug distribution, fraud, and forgery in connection to the death of her husband, Eric Richins.\nThe main concern presented by Judge Richard Mrazik surrounded out-of-court statements provided by two witnesses who may be called to the stand during the hearing. The two witnesses reportedly provided statements about conversations with Eric just months before his death when he first claimed Kouri was attempting to poison him.\n\nKouri\u2019s new defense attorneys, Kathy Nester and Wendy Lewis, objected to various parts of the statements, claiming they were not reliable hearsay and should not be admissible.\nJudge Mrazik overruled the defense\u2019s objections for the sole purpose of the upcoming preliminary hearing. Mrazik, however, agreed with the defense that they reserve the right to object to the statements outside of the preliminary hearing.\n\nNester then requested Richins to appear in the courtroom without being in handcuffs as she has in previous hearings. In her request, Nester said \u201CWe, as a defense team, do not feel any threat. We feel very safe sitting next to her.\u201D She also said the bindings would make it difficult for Richins to take notes during the hearing and would be a distraction for the defense team.\nMrazik did not offer a ruling on whether or not Richins would be free of handcuffs during the multi-day preliminary hearing. He first wanted to consider the request with the Summit County Sheriff\u2019s Office before making a decision.\n\nIt has been more than a year since Richins was initially arrested and charged with the murder of her husband. Legal hold ups including controversy over the now-infamous \u201CWalk the Dog\u201D letter as well as a change in attorneys for Richins have prevented the case from going to a preliminary hearing thus far.\n\n#khouririchins #utah #utahmom #ericrichins #murder #poison #poisoning \n\nWant to create live streams like this?

      "title": "EXPLOIT: MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE NOT SO GOOD LORI (HELLIS)-DAYBELL/VALLOW CASE",
      "description": "The recent updates from the Criminal Defense Attorney and forthcoming Author, who is focusing on the tragic events involving my family (Vallow/Daybell), have resurfaced intense emotions and memories linked to my past encounters with exploitation in this case. This has prompted me to feel an urgent need to host a livestream, which will allow me to share my story and unburden myself from its weight.\r\nDefinition of \u0022exploit\u0022:\r\nExploiting usually involves taking advantage of a vulnerability or weakness in a system or situation for personal gain.\r\nReflecting on the unforeseen involvement of my family in this high-profile and tragic saga, I am grappling with a range of emotions\u2014shock, disbelief, and profound sadness.\r\nThe media frenzy surrounding the Vallow/Daybell case brought both invasive scrutiny and enlightening insights. It compelled us to confront the harsh reality of the situation and question our understanding of our loved ones. The legal proceedings, endless speculation, and the public\u0027s insatiable curiosity added layers of complexity to our already strained relationships.\r\nAmidst the chaos, the support of friends and the strength of our remaining family bonds provided solace. We leaned on each other, finding glimpses of light in the darkest moments. The journey has been tumultuous, marked by sorrow, anger, and a quest for justice. However, it has also been a path of resilience, healing, and a steadfast commitment to honoring the memories of those we have lost.\r\nIn sharing my story, I aim to offer a glimpse into the human side of this tragic narrative. We are not just characters in a sensational news story; we are real individuals with genuine pain and hope for the future. My thoughts are with all those impacted by this unimaginable ordeal, and I am dedicated to seeking truth and peace amid the turmoil.\r\nIn the realm of true crime, exploitation can involve the inappropriate use of sensitive content for personal gain or entertainment. This could entail sensationalizing crime scenes, victims, or perpetrators, or manipulating the emotions of those affected for increased viewership or engagement. Such exploitation can be harmful and disrespectful to those involved and their families.\r\nIn the true crime community, we must remain vigilant and sensitive about exploitation. It is crucial to tell stories with dignity and respect, honoring the voices of victims and advocating for justice.\r\nOur goal is to ensure that every piece of content created or shared upholds ethical storytelling and contributes positively to the pursuit of justice. By promoting awareness, empathy, and responsible content creation, we can foster a community that respects the lives impacted by these tragic events.\r\nAs stewards of their memory and champions of justice, it is our duty to approach each story with gravity, avoiding sensationalism and focusing on the human aspect. Through ethical storytelling and responsible content creation, we honor the lives affected by these tragedies.\r\nI am prepared to share my personal experiences with exploitation in the Vallow/Daybell case. My intention is not to harm anyone\u0027s reputation but to free myself from the trauma I have endured. I appreciate your willingness to listen and provide a safe space for me to open up. Thank you in advance for this opportunity.\r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this? Check out StreamYard: https://streamyard.com/pal/d/4745242236682240",

      "description": "The Argument Against Lori Vallow\u0027s Niece Melani Boudreaux Pawlowski \u0026 The Arizona Conspiracy\r\n\r\nTune in for a live stream at 5:30pm Central Time (6:30pm Eastern, 4:30pm Mountain, and 3:30pm Pacific) for a crucial discussion on the potential involvement of Melani in the conspiracy to harm her ex-husband, Brandon Boudreaux. This comes shortly after Lori\u0027s brother, Alex Cox, was allegedly involved in the death of my uncle, Charles Vallow, on July 11, 2019, marking the start of a nightmare for my family. As the trials in Idaho conclude, focus now shifts to Lori Vallow Daybell\u0027s upcoming trial in Arizona. It\u0027s time to direct our attention to other possible co-conspirators, named and unnamed, and carefully examine the evidence presented by Arizona (Gilbert) Investigators. Their diligent efforts in the investigation aimed to locate those involved and determine the fate of the two missing children. We will continue reading the reports from both Chandler PD and Gilbert PD\u2019s FOIA documents and get a real sense of what lead investigators are saying about Melani\u2019s actual knowledge and involvements in the investigation. \r\n\r\nNow, in the wake of grieving of our family\u2019s losses and fortunate failed attempt on Brandons life, we pray for justice to be done for all those suffering from the terrible crimes committed by these lawless and inhumane people. Thank you for your support in this fight. \r\nLove always wins\u2014Charles Vallow\r\n\r\nnever ending tragedies. \r\n\r\n\u2014As we seek justice, we remember those we\u0027ve lost.

      "description": "Is it a Psychic Reading for Tim Ballard OR is it Elder Ballard speaking directions to Tim Ballard? It is a honest question, especially after hearing the heavily coded audios of Chad Daybell talking with Lori Vallow Daybell, Melani and Ian Pawlowski, and Zulema Pastenes and Alex Cox. \n\nAfter discovering yesterday (June 1, 2024) the coded \u0026 imo, DIRECTIONAL MESSAGES WITHIN THE DUBIOUS BOOK, VISONS OF GLORY, I BELIEVE THIS IS A FAIR QUESTION FOR THE ABSOLUTE BIZARRE AND RELIGIOUS BABBLE AND CRIMINAL ACTS THAT HAVE COME TO LIGHT FROM THESE QUESTIONABLE AND DEVOUT MORMONS. WHO IS CALLING THE SHOTS? WHO IS CONTROLLING THE MASTERFUL PUPPET STRINGS?

However, once Kresha entered Megan\u0027s livestream that was already in progress, there was no way to link the collab to also stream to DiffiCULT Research\u0027s live audience. It turned out that Megan didn\u0027t have the \u0022multi-stream option\u0022 checked and I was unable to provide the collab here on my channel. I apologize for any misinformation or confusion this has caused. I had never tried this option before but believe I know what to look for in future collabs. \nHere is a link of the conversation between Megan Conner and Kresha Easton of DiffiCULT Research.

It\u0027s disheartening when certain groups exploit their influence, claiming to be the sole voice of God and dictating entry conditions into the heavenly realm. Your engagement is key in raising awareness and fostering dialogue on these pressing issues.

SHE IS A WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE AND IS HERE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH US ABOUT THE TIES BETWEEN PEOPLE LIKE DAVID \u0026 CHELOM LEAVITT, WHO ARE BOTH TIED TO THE BEST FRIEND ANIMAL SOCIETY OF UTAH, AND CHELOM WORKS AS A SEX THERAPIST AT BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY. THE LEAVITT\u0027S HAVE BOTH BEEN NAMED IN THE HAMBLIN CASE BY THEIR ALLEGED VICTIMS. ALONG WITH ROBERT HAMBLIN, A BEHAVIORAL MODIFICATION SOCIOLOGIST WHO HAS BEEN FUNDED BY THE GIVERNMENT TO INVESTIGATE HIW POVERISHED CHILDREN CAN LEARN BY THE \u0022REWARD SYSTEM\u0022. MOST OF YOU WILL KNOW THIS BY LEARNING ABOUT THE CASE OF RUBY FRANKE AND JODI HILDEBRANT. WHOSE CASE OF EXTREME CHILD ABUSE HAS BEEN REVEALED. DAVID HAMBLIN\u0027S FATHER. ALSO A MORMON, ROBERT HAMBLIN HAS A MYRIAD OF ARTICLES ON BEHAVIORAL MODIFICATION IN CHILDREN FOR THE TAVIST\u00D3CK INSTITUTE. OTHER SKETCHY NAMES AND CONNECTIONS INCLUDE; GORDON BOWEN, JON HUNTSMAN, WHOSE NAME WAS FOUND IN JEFFREY EPSTEIN\u0027S LITTLE BLACK BOOK, UTAH SENATOR MIKE LEE, WHO SPOKE AT SOME OF THE SAME CONFERENCES AS CHAD DAYBELL, WHO ENDORSED TIM BALLARD FOR US SENATE.

      "description": "Unveiling Tim Ballard\u0027s Lineage: A Journey into the Past\n\nExplore the hidden secrets of Tim Ballard\u0027s ancestry with this video I prerecorded from November 26, 2023. It was my first quest to discover the truth behind Ballard\u0027s lineage. \n\nI recorded it and then almost deleted it because of the WRONG CONCLUSIONS that I made towards the ending but, rather than having to do a whole new video, I decided to upload the original one and share with you all. With the correction of course. \n\n**The video reveals that there is no relation between Tim and M. Russell Ballard\u0027s son, Craig, as previously assumed. Despite this setback, we remain hopeful and determined in our efforts in seeking justice through understanding.**\n\nThe story unfolds further in the form of a riddle. Lawsuits allege that Janet Russon, Tim\u0027s psychic, invoked the ancient prophet \u0022Nephi\u0022 during seances, scrying and automatic writings. Russon has tried to distance herself from these allegations during her appearance on (@ Last Dispensation\u2019s YouTube channel.\n\nAttempts to deflect criticism and embarrassment have been apparent in recent public statements. Russon has clarified in her own audio recording that she is calling up the legendary Mormon prophet Nephi than Tim\u0027s great x grandfather, Nephi Anderson. \n\nDespite the challenges, the journey into Tim Ballard\u0027s past provides a glimpse into his origins, offering insight into his character and the journey that led him here. The quest for truth and justice continues, fueled by the forces of love and compassion.\n\nJoin the movement with hashtags #lovealwayswins #justicefortyleeandjj #justicefortyleeandjj #justiceforcharlesvallow   #justicefortammydaybell  #justiceforjosephryan #timballard #our",

EXPLICIT CONTENT** Welcome to Difficult ReSearch. \n\n#timballard #lorivallow #chaddaybell #davidhamblin #thomharrison #utahelite  #mormonstories #loridaybell #jodihildebrandt #our #8passengers #lynnpacker #americancrimejournal #ballard #gordonbowen #hamblin #connexions #visionsofglory #exmormon #cs #sra #our #spearfund  #glennbeck #kenkrogue #thanksgivingpoint #secondcoming #therapist \n\nIn the story a shocking and unsettling discovery is made on September 15, 2023. It was revealed that Gordon Bowen had issued the church statement to Vice News regarding the separation between M Russell Ballard and Tim Ballard. \n\nThe timing of public shaming and lawsuits against Tim Ballard\n\nIt\u2019s suspicious that the public shaming of Ballard days before several lawsuits were filed against him. Former female operative allegations against him include sexual, spiritual, financial and personal misconduct came while he was promoting himself as a savior who would rescue thousands of children and women from the sexual slave trading industry, but it appears that Tim\u2019s motives were not entirely genuine. \n\nExtracting the lesson from the story in an effort to distance themselves from the impending attack against Ballard, the church used a disreputable individual who had been excommunicated to compose and release a statement to Vice News. \n\nExploring the life of Gordon Bowen of the church, Thom Harrison, and David Hamblin, get ready to uncover the disturbing tale of Gordon Bowen\u2018s life filled with lies and unspeakable behavior, his connections with the upper echelons of the church, Apostle/President of the Church of Latter-day Saints, M. Russell Ballard, Mitt Romney, Thom Harrison, and David Hamblin. \n\n\u2018To look away is to silence another victim. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll wait.\u201D\n\nCredit: https://1830\u200B\u2060@goel1830",

      "description": "Blaze News investigates: The psychic who guided Tim Ballard and some Operation Underground Railroad missions for years. \r\n\r\nBased on the information Blaze News has received from eight former OUR associates, Russon has had undue influence on Ballard, and therefore on OUR operations, for many years, perhaps even a decade or more. These witnesses uniformly told us that Ballard speaks to Russon almost daily, sometimes even multiple times per day. One individual guessed that during some busy periods, Russon worked nearly 80 hours a week providing psychic intel to Ballard. Another joked that Ballard never uses the bathroom without consulting her first.\r\n\r\n**Monday at 8:30pm EST | 7:30pm Central | 6:30pm MTN | 5:30pm Pacific Time.**\r\n\r\n**Become A Member Of @difficultresearch here:**\r\n**Perks/Channel Membership**\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-8RQaIR5oZDFy8aZbw3mYw/join\r\n\r\nViolent crime is indiscriminate; it knows no borders or boundaries.

Boudreaux and Pawlowski went through a long court battle over their four children, after their 2019 divorce. \r\n\u2014According to Mesa\u2019s police report, Pawlowski agreed to take herself off the bank account for Boudreaux\u2019s business known as Cougar Consulting. Bank records show Pawlowski accessed the Chase Bank account several months after signing the divorce decree. Investigators say Pawlowski was supposed to remove herself from the account no more than 60 days after the sale of the former couple\u2019s property on October 3, 2019. The account was accessed sometime after March 2, 2020.\r\n\u2014\u0022Garrett told me it is not Melani\u2019s fault that Brandon was \u2018dumb\u2019 and did not change the login information until three days after Melani accessed the online account,\u0022 the detective recounted in the police report. \r\n\u2014Smith told police that Pawlowski believed Boudreaux owed her money from the check and that is why she logged into the account to get a copy to her attorney.\r\n\u2014The investigation concluded with the detective finding probable cause to charge Pawlowski with one count of computer tampering which is a class 3 felony. \r\n\u2014\u0022Melani Pawlowski knowingly accessed Brandon Boudreaux\u2019s Chase Bank business account for Cougar Consulting,\u0022 reported the detective. \r\n\u2014The charge against Pawlowski has been dismissed, according to the court on Sept. 26.\r\n\u2014New details surrounding the family of Lori Vallow continue to emerge, months following the disappearance of two children with ties to Arizona.\r\n\u2014Pawlowski has a criminal record in Utah. She was arrested for criminal trespassing with a domestic violence enhancement in November 2019 when police say she tried to get her children who were staying with Boudreaux\u2019s parents in American Fork City in two separate incidents. The grandparents called 911 when Pawlowski would not leave the property. \r\n\u2014Pawlowski was convicted and then sentenced in December of 2020 and put on probation according to court records.\r\n\r\n**Become a channel member to support our efforts in furthering our goals and to improve the quality of our researches by using the best available resources and tools to help us achieve our mission in this journey towards justice through understanding.**\r\nlives.   \r\n\r\n**Become A Member Of @difficultresearch here:**\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-8RQaIR5oZDFy8aZbw3mYw/join\r\n\r\nViolent crime is indiscriminate; it knows no borders or boundaries.

I promise you it\u2019s not for anything positive. Yikes! Mormon Madness continues on this week. See you all in a few! \r\n\r\n** The lesson to rank and file Latter Day Saints is this: when your church\u2019s interest require it, you can be delivered to the secular media and the public as a sacrifice, immolated for the benefit of the leadership and its favored sons like Mitt Romney. They are not obligated to follow their own normal processes, either. They can incinerate your entire reputation for whatever reason, including reasons that may be little more than rumor, even if other reasons exist which would constitute a valid grounds for church discipline. Why any Latter Day Saint would expect anything different from the corroded leadership of the current church is beyond comprehension, given the Church\u2019s documented willingness to punish the families of se*ual abuse victims and victims themselves for pushing back against the Church\u2019s advise to forgive p*dophiles and serial child ra*ists.**\r\nThere is zero evidence that the LDS is looking at M. Russell Ballard\u2019s own actions in terms of discipline, which would be appropriate given the long standing principle that Apostles as full time employees of the Church should not hold outside business interests, especially sketchy and controversial ones. The Church claims that its disciplinary processes are designed to be restorative, to lead to repentance and reunion with the Church in the form of re-baptism, but the way in which Tim Ballard\u2019s excommunication was conducted was clearly designed for public humiliation. If that immorality is criminal, they should be excommunicated and reported to law enforcement. However, the COJCLDS has fought any requirement to report se*ual abuse for decades, while deciding that reporting Tim Ballard to Vice News was the appropriate course of action. The absurdity is obvious, as is the complete lack of a moral or scriptural basis for the way in which Tim Ballard\u2019s excommunication was handled. This was deeply and totally wrong.**\u2014Go-EL\r\n\r\n\r\n**Become a channel member to support our efforts in furthering our goals and to improve the quality of our researches by using the best available resources and tools to help us achieve our mission in this journey towards justice through understanding.**\r\n\r\nThis can be a major success for our community and will impact the lives of those who are affected by violent crime.\r\n\r\n**Become A Member Of @difficultresearch here:**\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-8RQaIR5oZDFy8aZbw3mYw/join\r\n\r\n**Hello \u0026 Welcome To My YouTube Channel.

It has been an interesting journey for me to learn more about and to see how they could actually play out in a court of law. The power of the church is felt by all of us whether we believe it or not. My 4 years of researching these issues has made me realize how much of a problem this truly is. I suggest you do the same and research for yourself. Knowledge is power and it will help you to learn more about the world we live in. \n\nJoin the conversation!

It is NOT just isolated events that happen every so often. These are unnerving events that involve children and a deprave belief system that is so obscure and in \u201CJodi-Ism\u201D, it is DISTORTED! I want to continue digging down and getting to the bottom of these terrible issues that have left a trail of victims in its wake. Three of them being my family members.  Not to mention my mom was also on their Zombie Hitlist. It hits so close to home for me and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be comfortable in life again because there are things like this that are still happening.

The child who was able to escape from Jodi Hildebrandt\u2019s 3 million dollar lair in Southern Utah (near St. George) was described by a neighbor as asking for food and water and described by the neighbor as being emaciated by his mother and her business partner, Jodi Hildebrandt.

In the 911 call, the neighbor described the boy as being \u201Cemaciated\u201D and told dispatch that he appeared to have been bound with duct tape and had multiple wounds.

      "description": "MORMON MILLIONAIRE\u2019S DAUGHTER | CHARGED IN MURDER OF EX HUSBAND, JARED BRIDEGAN, MICROSOFT EXECUTIVE. \n\nShanna Lee Gardner- Fernandez was arrested on August 17, 2023 in Washington state for allegedly murdering her ex husband, Jared Bridegan, in Jacksonville Florida, as he was driving home from parenting time with he and Shanna\u2019s twins (boy and girl). \nJared had his 2 year old baby girl in the backseat when he noticed a spare tire obstructing the roadway on his route back home. He got out to move the tire so he could pass when he was gunned down in front of his two year old daughter.  \n\nThis case reminds me of Melani Boudreaux Pawlowski in the case of Brandon Boudreaux who was shot at by Alex Cox and where Lori Vallow Daybell was indicted for Conspiracy to commit murder back in October of 2019. in his route from dropping their shared children off at home with Shanna and as he was returning home with his then 2 year old baby girl whom he had with his current wife, Kirsten Bridegan. \n\nWe will be following this case and plan to stream any updates and court dates in the future. The first stream will be on September 14, 2023 when Shanna is to appear in court to answer to her charges. #justiceforcharlesvallow #justiceforjosephryan #jaredbridegan #shannagardner \n#shannafernandez #shannaleegardnerfernandez #shannaleegardner  #stampinup #mormon #lds #lorivallow #chaddaybell #melaniboudreaux #melanipawlowski #brandonboudreaux #lorivallow #loridaybell #lorivallowdaybell #chaddaybell #alexcox \njusticefortammydaybell",

Boyce then sentenced the \u201Ctranslated being\u201D to 3 LWOP sentences and ordered her to pay restitution for fraudulent crimes she committed against the US Government. (Arizona has already ordered the extradition of Lori to face criminal charges in Maricopa County for the murder of MY uncle, Charles Vallow as well as the attempt on Brandon Boudreaux\u2019s life). \r\n\r\nSo, in the sense of \u201Clike-minded people\u201D, Lets take a fun look at what Lori Daybell meant by things like, \u201CEternal Friend\u201D, \u201CBusy\u201D, \u201CCommanded\u201D, \u201CBeing a Personal Witness to Jesus Christ\u201D and \u201CAdult Spirits\u201D were all about. Nothing better than getting \u201Cgreater light and knowledge\u201D. We will also talk about some of the other Mormonology related things that we\u2019ve heard from these deplorable individuals throughout the case. A insightful discussion that will surely help us to  get a better view with our getting \u201Cjustice through understanding\u201D. \r\n\r\nI really dove deep into this one and am looking forward to sharing my research with you. We will have many questions answered by the end of this case. \r\nThis\u2019ll be a fun one for us to do as a community so please, join us for this latest plunge into Lori Vallow Daybell\u2019s \u201CBizarre Religious Rabbit Hole\u201D. \r\n\r\nMonday 8pm EST | 7pm Central | 6pm MTN | 5pm Pacific Time. \r\n\r\n**Become a channel member to support our efforts in furthering our goals and to improve the quality of our researches by using the best available resources and tools to help us achieve our mission in this journey towards justice through understanding.**\r\n\r\nThis will be a major success for our community and will impact the lives of those who are affected by violent crime.\r\n\r\n**Become A Member Of @difficultresearch here:**\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-8RQaIR5oZDFy8aZbw3mYw/join\r\n\r\n**Hello \u0026 Welcome To My YouTube Channel.

I WISH MORE  MORMONS AND EX MORMONS WOULD ANALYZE CHAD DAYBELL AND LORI DAYBELL\u0027S CASES. I wish Mormons and Ex-Mormons knew just how much of the puzzle pieces they hold for the rest of us Non-Mormons to learn \u0026 understand how the infrastructures work in the Church and in Mormon Culture. I find it extremely fascinating and interesting to say the least, plus, It helps me understand the \u0022WHY\u0027S\u0022 for my family members being Ritually \u0022Redrummed\u0022. I appreciate channels like this one for not being afraid to do deeper probes in a case such as this!

SO THIS MEANS THAT LORI DIDN\u0027T JUST HALLUCINATE THAT SHE SAW JESUS IN THE FLESH WHILE IN THE MORMON TEMPLE?? WHAAAAAT??   THE DEATH PENALTY SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF OF THE TABLE BECAUSE LORI DAMN DAYBELL IS NOT \u0027THAT KIND OF CRAZY\u0027!!\r\nNAY-NAY... When a Mormon receives their SECOND COMFORTER (EXPERIENCE), THEY ARE ACTUALLY REFERENCING SYMBOLISM INSIDE THE TEMPLE AND IMO, IT MAKES THEM ABSOLUTELY INCAPABLE OF BEING UNDERSTOOD BY ANOTHER SOUL WHO SITS ON THE OUTSIDE OF MORMONISM.. THIS IS THE MOST OVERT ACT INFLICTED UPON UNSUSPECTING MEMBERS INTHE CHURCH BECAUSE IT IS AN EXTREMELY MANIPULATIVE TACTIC TO WHICH THE CHURCH INDOCTRINATES AND FURTHER ISOLATES ITS PREY. \r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

      "description": "Going live on Sunday evening to discuss the alarming similarities between the cases of Jeffrey Lundgren and Chad Daybell. Join me @8/7c pm 6/5pm mountain time. I am shocked at how similar the facts of the Lundgren \u201CKirtland Cult Killers\u201D case echoes the same stories of both men who have both been charged (Lundren being put to death) with murders in connection with their beliefs in Blood Atonement/aka Sacrificing innocent blood. \r\n\r\nHere is a snippet from an article on the Lundgren case;\r\n\r\n\u201CLaTourette was the lead attorney in the Jeffrey\r\nLundgren trial.\r\nWe kept waiting for the insanity defense, but it never came, LaTourette said.\r\nKowall was second chair in what to that point was the highest-profile murder trial in the county\u0027s history.\r\n\u0027Steve was masterful; Kowall said. \u0027He approached it by not putting religion as the crux of his case. He showed Jeff Lundgren for who he was, a master manipulator and greedy, egocentric individual!\u201D \r\n\r\nI will be reading factual information regarding the details of the Jeffrey Lundgren \u201CKirtland Cult Killings\u201D from a 24 page report from casetext.org website that I feel is very relevant to the case of Chad \u0026 Lori (Vallow) Daybell\u2019s case. I hope you\u2019ll join us. \r\n\r\nHappy Fathers Day to all of you Fathers out there. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

ALL BECAUSE I KINDLY \u0026 RESPECTFULLY ASKED HER TO BACK OFF FROM trying to FORCE ME into making PLANS with HER for the boise trip to attend the trial of my aunt, Lori Vallow\u2019s) trial for murd3ring my nephew \u0026 cousin Tylee! SHE HAD ALL ACCESS TO MY ACCOUNTS AND MY YOUTUBE ACCOUNT. SHE NEVER SAID A WORD ABOUT IT, ASIDE FROM TELLING ME SHE WOULDN\u2019T BE HERE FOR THE STREAM DUE TO HER HAVING A MIGRAINE  BUT SHE WAS IN CHAT, ONLY SHE DIDN\u2019T MAKE HER PRESENCE KNOWN  SHE WAS WATCHING ME DO A LIVE SHOW AND WATCHING ME STRUGGLE AND DO IT ALONE, WITH ZERO HELP!!!  Umm, NARCISSIST MUCH!?! I wanted to make this known to you but there isnt an easy way to do it publicly without causeing even more drama. This would only ensure retaliation from her \u0026 I had to get my accounts secured before doing so.  Moral of the story is this; people prey on other people all the time and she proved that she is an even more dangerous and evil woman for how she preyed and exploited me during my most vulnerable moments!  It totally made me think about how Lori Daybell stripped Tylee and JJ from their support, stability, and emotional support!! I also felt \u201CKathy Bates\u201D vibes in that movie with that author that she victimized so she could be the one to care for him and depend solely upon her.. Yikes!!

It all goes back to this \u201CChurch of the Firstborn\u201D idea that imo, was introduced by THEIR CHURCH!!!!! When one is \u201Canointed\u201D (second anointing), they are dubbed as a Queen/King, Priest/Priestess! They are inducted into the Church of the Firstborn!!!! The Church boldly promotes their belief in the \u201CLITERAL GATHERING OF ISRAEL\u201D so establishing \u0026 ordaining \u201CLIKE-MINDED MEMBERS\u201D is doing just that! They are \u201CGATHERING ISRAEL\u201D which is ESTABLISHING \u201CTHE CHURCH OF THE FIRSTBORN\u201D!! It is a \u201CHeaven on earth\u201D so to speak!

But he did talk about the Second Anointing and in the same topic, mentioned Chad and Lori Vallow Daybell. He was noting their alleged sense of ego and elitism and how this kind of behavior or this kind of responsibility. burden, weight, (I say EMPOWERMENT), that the church allegedly places upon the shoulders of every single member who has ever received the second anointing! Can you even imagine? This is why I have always stressed the point, \u0022What about the rest of them???\u0022 And I still mean this to this very day. I am not anti-mormon nor am I anti any other religion. I am however, against murder and corruption...oh and LIARS!! We may have different beliefs and neither of our beliefs are anything close to normal compared to the beliefs of the next guy, All I am asking for is an open mind, compassion, grace, and empathy. And for Christ\u0027s sake, please do not place a temple, a man, a leader of your congregation, or a church building nor its name for a season, above the lives of my family members who were human and murdered allegedly in the name of whomever they worship. #lovealwayswins #secondanointing #secondendowment #arkofthenewcovenant #everlastingcovenant",

What a week right!?** \r\n\r\nJoin Me Sunday Evening @ 7 Eastern, 6 Central, 5 Mountain, 4 Pacific, to discuss the plethora of documents filed by John Prior, Chad Daybell\u2019s Defense Attorney. It\u2019s been quite obvious that Chad Daybell has been trying to distance himself from his 2nd wife, Lori Vallow Daybell, pretty much since the beginning (imo). I believe that the Karma Bus Has left the station \u0026 is aimed straight for Lori Vallow Daybell (\u0026 her dead brother, Alex Cox). **But Chad \u0026 Lori Fought So Hard To Be Together!!** Anyway, we all knew that it would never work out in their favor! Soooo\u2026.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ipetitions.com/petition/justice-for-tylee-ryan-jj-vallow-charles-vallow\r\n\r\nTO REMOVE CHAD DAYBELL BOOKS FROM AMAZON, SOGN \u0026 SHARE THIS PETITION LINK HERE:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.change.org/p/amazon-amazon-should-remove-all-chad-daybell-books\r\n\r\n(We Don\u2019t Want To Fund Commissary For Chad \u0026/Or Lori!). So\u2026\r\n  \r\nPlease take a moment and sign this petition for Judge Boyce to Allow Cameras in the Idaho Courtroom for the upcoming trials! We want all of our family members, friends, and justice seekers to be able to see this all the way through!! But above all, WE DEMAND TRANSPARENCY!! Trust me, I have my own opinions. However, signing \u0026 sharing this petition with everyone you know, would help us in our advocacy efforts!

It will be the first time they will be together/in person, since Lori was arrested (early 2020). That\u2019s a long dang time y\u2019all! I think It will create more questions (as expected) but will also answer some of the questions we\u2019ve all asked since the beginning of their unraveling and alleged murder spree. \r\n\r\nJoin me Tuesday 9a/cst, 10a/Eastern, \u0026 8a/Mountain. (The livestream is scheduled an hour earlier than the actual court hearing). It will  allow us time to wake up, settle in, \u0026 chat about this \u0026 other topics relative to the cases, on Tuesday, August 16, 2022. \r\n\r\n**My Uncle Charles Vallow Would Have Turned 65 on August 17, 2022!  May He Rest In Eternal Peace. I love and miss my uncle every single day. There\u2019s not one moment in my day that I\u2019m not thinking of him, Tylee, JJ, Tammy, \u0026 Joe. I pray for love, light, happiness, peace, humility, grace, forgiveness, \u0026 healing.

According to News Reporter, Eric Grossarth, with East Idaho News hit his \u201CLIVE\u201D Button and began reporting on the heavy police presence and activity at the residence of Chad Daybell \u0026 His Then Late Wife, Mrs. Tamara (Tammy) Douglas Daybell. \r\n\r\n\u2022I remember coming out of a dream-like state and recall vaguely hearing the voice of Eric Grossarth as he was talking in a low voice about the activity at Chad\u2019s property. I immediately sat straight up in my bed and locked eyes with my fianc\u00E9 Jason\u2019s cell phone where it was showing the live feed of this footage. No words were spoken and we both sat in our bed staring at his phone. We later learned that we were watching with the rest of the world. \r\n\u2022Nate Eaton wrangled up an entire \u201Cchopper\u201D and provided us with live footage from a \u201Cbird\u2019s eye view\u201D. It was all far too much for me to handle and process. I can only recall the terror that I felt. One day I\u2019ll be able to effectively share a more in-depth account. \r\nFor now, I just want to thank you for being here with me as I make my way through this journey. #godsarmy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVENMO USERNAME:\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\r\n@4DifficultReSearch \r\n\r\nPAYPAL LINK:\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\r\nhttps://www.paypal.me/4diffiCULTreSEARCH?locale.x=en_US\r\n\r\nFacebook:\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/diffiCULTreSEARCH\r\n\r\nYouTube: @diffiCultReSearch\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\r\nhttps://youtube.com/c/DiffiCULTreSEARCH/\r\n\r\nTo Become a Patreon Member \r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 \r\nhttps://patreon.com/difficultresearch/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\u2022Flashback: Both days that the children were buried on Chad Daybell\u2019s property, Tammy Daybell (Chad\u2019s Late Wife of 29 years), was still alive and by all accounts, and reported to be \u201CIN GOOD HEALTH\u201D.    #JusticeForTammyDaybell \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll topics and statements within should be taken as opinion only and not based on facts only.

Other Victims include Tammy Daybell and Joseph Ryan. \n\nI\u2019ve been seeking a more defined and concise explanation of the seemingly \u201Cproblematic\u201D or \u201Ccontroversial\u201D doctrine; \u201CMultiple Mortal Probations\u201D. \n\nI am only seeking a better understanding of this particular doctrine and doctrines of the like. Chad \u0026 Lori (Vallow) Daybell \u0026 many others share the same belief in this doctrine. So much so, that Hector Sosa (allegedly) wrote an email to other members of \u201CPathway to Zion\u201D or PTZ, allegedly stating to specifically not share knowledge of \u201CMultiple Mortal Probations\u201D and \u201CEnergy Healing\u201D with leadership (because it would most likely lead to excommunication). Allegedly of course. This email was allegedly shared at the beginning of the unraveling of Chad \u0026 Lori\u2019s (alleged) murderous spree.\nWhat about \u201Cmultiple mortal probations\u201D and \u201Cenergy healing\u201D would be worth hiding? \nExactly. If there\u2019s nothing to hide then all should be \u201CWell in Zion\u201D. \n\n*** LINKS FOR \u201CTHE TAMMY DAYBELL FOUNDATION\u201D HERE***\n\n1.

My brother Todd, is named after our dad, Dennis (TODD) Trahan.  I\u2019m grateful our Mawmaw Trahan was able to meet JJ before he was stolen from us. This was also the only time my brother was able both mentally and physically, to meet his only child, his son (JJ), and lock eyes with him for the very first time since he entered this world. And JJ was fighting for his life then. That\u2019s just it\u2026. JJ reminds me that we are fighters. We will never stop because we don\u2019t know what that is. My entire family is the same \u0026 well, We just don\u2019t give up around here.",

So, I\u2019m in the planning stages of having a nice bricked memorial with a huge light in its center and when darkness falls, there will be two radiant beams of light shining up to the heavens to always remind us and everyone just how vibrant and radiant these two beautiful children truly were. One color will be blue \u0026 the other purple as they signify JJ and Tylee\u2019s favorite colors. I\u2019m also work on memorials for my Uncle Charles Vallow, Tammy Douglas Daybell, and Joseph Ryan\u2019s lives too. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re such an amazing group of people, or as I like to refer to you as \u201CGOD\u2019S ARMY\u201D!!!

      "description": "LISTEN TO ANGELINE LAW January 07, 2020, AS SHE TALKS WITH CHANDLER PD; SAYS HER FORMER FRIEND, LORI VALLOW, HAD TOLD HER SHE \u201CHIRED ALEX TO KILL JOE\u201D. SHE LEARNED THROUGH THIS CONVO WITH THE DETECTIVE, OR AT LEAST IT SEEMS LIKE MAYBE ANGELINE DISCOVERS THAT ALEX DID ACTUALLY ATTACK JOE RYAN WITH A TASER GUN AND DID SERVE A RATHER LIGHT SENTENCE IN MY OPINION. I ALSO FEEL THAT THE CRIME DID NOT MATCH THE TIME ALEX SERVED. HE OBVIOUSLY DIDN\u2019T LEARN HIS LESSON AND SEEMS LIKE PERHAPS IT ONLY MADE HIM GROW WITH HATE. I DO NOT FEEL JOSEPH RYAN DIED OF NATURAL CAUSES. IT IS MY OPINION THAT LORI RYAN VALLOW DAYBELL DID ASSASSINATE JOE\u2019S CHARACTER AND MURDERED HIS SPIRIT. I ALSO FEEL SHE DID \u201CPOSSESS A MURDEROUS HEART\u201D AND THAT SHE ALLEGEDLY KNEW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO TO STOP THE BLEEDING \u0026 STOP THE PAIN\u201D. \nIn fact, Lori is rather easy for me to read. Im sure so many others feel the same. She says in her recording at Melanie Gibb\u2019s Home, that she did not like confrontation, she hates to fight. I beg to differ. IN MY OPINION, LORI VALLOW DAYBELL COX LAGIOIA MEANS YANES RYAN INMATE NUMBER ###### LOVES CONFRONTATION. BEHIND BARS, CHAD AND LORI VALLOW DAYBELL, SEEM TO POSSESS MORE RIGHTS THAN US COVICTIMS, BUT I DISAGREE. I KNOW THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY, THOSE WALLS CLOSE IN MORE AND MORE AND EVENTUALLY FEEL SUFFOCATING. IS THAT THE RIGHT WORD? MAYBE ASPHYXIATION? IDK BECAUSE IM NOT BEHIND BARS WITH MULTIPLE INDICTMENTS OF CONSPIRING TO MURDER MY BOYFRIENDS WIFE AND MURDERING MY INNOCENT BABIES. IT MUST FEEL PRETTY CRAPPY LIVING INSIDE YOUR OWN PRISON FOR BOTH CHAD AND LORI. CAN YOU IMAGINE HAVING ALL THAT \u201CLOIN FIRE\u201D WITH NO ONE TO SHARE THAT WITH. OOPS WELL MAYBE NOT SO MUCH LORI BUT IN MY OPINION CHAD IS INTO PORTALS AND IS PRETTY MUCH A FREE CANDIDATE. MAYBE LORI WILL REALIZE THAT SHE MAY POSSIBLY BE SICK BUT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, IN MY OPINION, MY FORMER AUNT FINALLY GOT EVERYTHING SHE EVER WANTED. MAYBE!? Perhaps. We will never know and also, who cares. I want to begin calling them by their inmate numbers so that they feel dehumanized like they allegedly made those around them that loved them feel. Dehumanized to zombified then mummified. I love knowing they are all in Heaven and will never be hurt by these \u201Cpretty birds\u201D ever again. Not in the afterlife either. \nHey, im only human and sometimes I feel angry. I am going to express my anger and my feelings here. It is my right to do so. They won\u2019t take my rights away from me. I usually would copy \u0026 paste into my notes but I shared with my fianc\u00E9 Jason \u0026 he reminded me that it is my right and he agrees with my opinions as being rather true. \n\nOn a different note, thanks everyone for stopping by to say hi and share your thoughts and opinions with me. I really enjoy seeing you all come by and visit. It really helps. I want to thank so many if you who have donated for #Justicefortyleeandjj bracelets! You guys have absolutely no idea just how much your support and presence makes a difference. We are her to advocate for #charlesvallow #Tyleeryan Tammydaybell #jjvallow \u0026 Joeryan \nTheir voices were robbed from them. Not on my watch and i know, not on your watches either. Thank you for rallying around me, my family, as well as Annie, and anyone else standing up and being the voices for our family members. #LoveAlwaysWins \nIt is the L. A.

From Every Race, Creed, Religion, Gender, Political Stance, Perspectives, Walks Of Life, Young, \u0026 Old. This Is Where I See \u0026 Feel Them The Most, As Do The Rest Of Our Families. Do we miss them? Yes!! Every moment of every single day. Is this difficult for us to do especially in \u201Creal time\u201D and \u201Cin the public\u201D? Yes! It\u2019s rather intimidating \u0026 even scary in my opinion but I also question how families deal with this when they have a missing, lost, or murdered loved one fall victim!! This is the most difficult time I\u2019ve ever experienced \u0026 I love hearing from each and everyone of you who support me \u0026 my family as we journey towards justice. Is it easy? Absolutely not. Is it worth it? Yes, THEY\u2019RE WORTH IT! Sometimes we get all caught up in the evil details of Chad Daybell \u0026 Lori Vallow Daybell \u0026 we lose focus as to who lies at the heart of the matter. It\u2019s just a reminder to everyone following these cases. I appreciate you for INVESTING in our families.\nEvery one of you invest your time, energy, money, expertise, \u0026 degrees into the victims \u0026 our families. I feel that we can never thank you enough quite honestly. It\u2019s beautiful, it\u2019s reassuring, \u0026 comforting. \nI thank you from the bottom of my heart \u0026 appreciate your generosity. Every little bit will help me turn this negative into many positives by building their website, keeping up with the costs for this channel, \u0026 establishing foundations in their names so that their legacies may live on \u0026 help victims \u0026 families of victims in the future. We\u2019ve got a lot of work ahead of us with changing many things like, protocols, process \u0026 procedures, laws, grief groups, child protection, all the way to gender discrimination. There\u2019s so much to think about \u0026 put pen to paper. Please feel free to share your ideas \u0026 thoughts on where changes can be made. I do need help with technical issues, streamlining everything, \u0026 basically anything else w/building their platform. Its for Tylee, JJ, \u0026 Charles. I do everything by myself. From editing \u0026 uploading videos, learning youtube \u0026 livestreaming, researching constantly, grieving, processing, keeping up w/ court movements, planning \u0026 coordinating trips to attend trial(s), conversing \u0026 responding to comments on social media platforms, designing merch to generate funding, retain attorney to create non profits in Tylee, Charles, \u0026 JJ\u2019s names. There\u2019s so much work involved \u0026 its more difficult doing alone. I don\u2019t mind but it\u2019s taking me forever to accomplish. My parents are on board but just aren\u2019t quite ready to deal with or take on at this time, Understandably so. I think it has been the only thing holding me together. I\u2019ve never been anyone to ask for help but God has a way of humbling us. I realize that its too much on one person. So I am asking for help from anyone who feels up to the challenge.

I have never been a person who asks for help but God has a way of humbling us \u0026 I realize that this is too much on one person. So I am asking for help from anyone who feels up to the challenge.

      "description": "Chad Daybell called an Arizona funeral home the day Charles Vallow was shot and killed by Lori Vallow Daybell\u0027s brother, according to newly released police documents. He spelled his name as Chad \u0022Dabal\u0022 and asked how much a cremation would cost.\n\nA transcript of the phone call to Valley of the Sun Mortuary and Cemetery was included in a Chandler police report. The call was made just before 8 p.m. on July 11, 2019. Vallow would have been shot and killed about 12 hours earlier, according to documents.\n\n\u0022Um, we just had a death in the family and, we really don\u0027t want anything but a cremation and then to send the cremains to a family in Louisiana,\u0022 Daybell asks the funeral home employee in the recorded call. \u0022Just a simple no, nothing other than the cremation and sending him to his family for a service in Louisiana. So, is, is there any way to know a ballpark price on that.\u0022\n\nDaybell claimed to be from Iowa and said his uncle \u0022John Dabal\u0022 had died at the hospital. He said the body would be taken to the medical examiner and explained he wanted the body cremated in Chandler before shipping the cremains to New Orleans.\n\n\u0022And we\u0027ll deal with the service latter (giggles),\u0022 the transcript of the call reads. \u0022So just trying to get a ballpark price.\u0022\n\nThe funeral home gave Daybell a quote for around $2,000, which included shipping of the remains. Daybell said he would call other funeral homes for estimates and the call ended.\n\nThe day after Vallow was shot and killed, Lori Vallow sent a text to his two sons who lived in another state.\n\u0022Hi boys. I have very sad news. Your dad passed away yesterday.\n\nI\u0027m working on making arrangements and I\u0027ll keep you informed with what\u0027s going on. I\u0027m still not sure how to handle things. \n\nJust want you to know that I love you and so did your dad,\u0022 Lori said \n\n\nJustice For Tylee And JJ Bracelets\n\nDonate Here For Your Own  #JusticeForTyleeAndJJ Bracelet:\n\nhttps://py.pl/1DJREo\n\n\nAnyone wishing to help support my mission can donate via Venmo or PayPal, here are those links:\n\nVenmo: username is @KreshaGoodwin\n\nPayPal Link:\n\nhttps://paypal.me/difficultresearch?locale.x=en_US\n\nEmail: \n\nDifficultReSearchllc@gmail.com\n\nKresha0123@gmail.com\n\n\nhttps://youtube.com/c/diffiCULTreSEARCH\n\nTo get to @The L Mom YouTube Channel, Here is the link:\n\n https://youtube.com/c/THELMOM\n\nCenter For Missing \u0026 Exploited Children phone number: 1-800-843-5678\n\nhttps://go.missingkids.org/e/808593/hopelive/4gsct4/175702787?h=t6rurkd1HV6_JTFy13sJvJSef0Ct7lo6N7jv7_BY7e4\n\n#LoveAlwaysWins\n\uD83D\uDC99\uD83D\uDC99\uD83D\uDC9C\uD83D\uDC99\uD83D\uDC9C\uD83D\uDC99\uD83D\uDC9C\uD83D\uDC99\uD83D\uDC9C\n\n#justicefortyleeandjj\n#justiceforcharlesvallow\n#justicefortammydaybell\n#justiceforjosephryan \n\n@The L Mom\n@Websleuths\n@Chasing A Murderer\n@Pretty Lies And Alibis\n@Breaking Crime with Big E\n@Internal Negro Affairs (Marlawn aka Sherlock Homeboy) \n@Jess Nelson-Miss Trial\n@Noor Jasmine \n@Its a crime\n@Kj in the RAY \n\n\nCredit Source:\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSource: Judge Steven W.

I see her in the Burger King drive through as I have my entire life. Calm, cool, collective, normal everyday shit here folks. WTF!? I must have missed the memo on this and I am blessed that I did. How do you load your kiddos up into your estranged \u0026 now Murdered/dead husband, taking his phone, wallet, keys to the rental he was using, and drive through a fast food chain and pretend it\u2019s just \u201CBusiness as usual\u201D? Hearing about it and having to just picture it is so very different than actually seeing it. I don\u2019t understand why this evil 8i\u002B\u20ACh has been in my family and our lives for this long and just flips this kind of switch. Unrecognizable and unbelievably deceptive and just diabolical.\n\nI balled through Tylee\u2019s entire interview time. I will use her humming as my channel which is their channel for intros and outtros. I\u2019ll use it everywhere so people can hear TYLEE\u2019S VOICE. It was ignored, muted, never acknowledged and I be damned if that continues to be the case. I love my family angels. I miss them every moment of every day. I have got to do something big. Not just one big thing but a limitless amount of big things that will help anyone who needs help, advocacy, a voice, safe place, and I welcome and would be honored to help any race, creed, political status, color, gender, every human being that lives with  all of us on this planet. Anyone and everyone. \n\nSorry I know this is such a rant but it needs to be heard, taken seriously, positively, and it needs people who are serious about changing our world. It begins within and works outwardly from there. In my opinion at least. #lovealwayswins #justicefortyleeandjj  #justiceforcharlesvallow #justicefortammydaybell #justiceforjosephryan #loridaybell #ldsfraud #lds #mormon #jjvallow #zulemapastenes #cultmom #zulema #alexcox #melaniegibb #davidwarwick,#ianpawlowski #melanipawlowski #BrandonBoudreaux  #AprilRaymond\n\n\uD83D\uDC99\uD83D\uDC9C\uD83D\uDC99\uD83D\uDC9C\uD83D\uDC99\uD83D\uDC9C\uD83D\uDC99\uD83D\uDC9C\n\n\nJustice For Tylee And JJ Bracelets\n#justicefortyleeandjj\n#justiceforcharlesvallow\n#justicefortammydaybell\n#justiceforjosephryan \n\n#LoveAlwaysWins\n\uD83D\uDC99\uD83D\uDC99\uD83D\uDC9C\uD83D\uDC99\uD83D\uDC9C\uD83D\uDC99\uD83D\uDC9C\uD83D\uDC99\uD83D\uDC9C\n\nA shoutout to one of my favorite YouTube creators, Jen @The L Mom \n\nPlease check her channel out here on YouTube..

He has tried over 85 jury trials in Idaho State Courts. He has won jury verdicts of \u201Cnot guilty in criminal court in 10 different counties with clients charged from DUI to MURDER. He appears regularly in divorce court and has won custody cases for his clients. \n\nI give three different cases that he has been a part of and plan on sharing more videos on topics regarding Mr. Archibald. \n \nhttps://www.east Idaho news.com\n\nEastIdahoNews.Com\n\nhttps://idahostatejournal.com\nBrian Driggs/Angie Dodge Murder Trial\n\nhttps://idahostatejournal.com\nJameion Hernandez Murder Sentencing for murdering Lisa Stukey\n\nA shoutout to one of my favorite YouTube creators @The L Mom \nPlease check out her channel.

I am asking for help with expenses involved in establishing a NPO and for travel expenses to and from Idaho \u0026 Arizona (depends upon Lori\u2019s Competency). I have been pondering on how to handle this exactly. I knew frkm the very beginning that it was my duty to honor the lives of Tylee, JJ, and Charles, I just didn\u2019tbknow exactly how at the time. But iver the course of the past two years, as information has been unraveling, it has become more clearer to me as to what I need to do in order to obtain and meet my goals. This NPO is in its beginning stages and I know I will need help with paying for legal council to help guide me through the process of establishing their NPO.  This organization will assure their names and faces are never forgotten and will be able to \u201Cpay it forward\u201D to help others from becoming victims. This will include changes to existing policies and procedures, as well as implementing new laws and/or changing existing laws. Like my Uncle Charles Said; \u201CLove Always Wins\u201D, this will only help me in delivering that message to people who are victims of crime and circumstances. I do appreciate the support and kindness from everyone throughout this numb \u0026 paralyzing process. Thank you to each and every one of you who show love and respect to myself, my family, and the victims who stand at the very center of these tragedies.

Charles Vallow was my Uncle. Tylee Ryan was the bravest young lady I have ever known. And JJ Vallow, he was my 7 year old autistic nephew. Tylee and JJ were murdered and found buried in shallow graves on the property of Chad Daybell on June 9, 2019. They had been missing for 10 months prior to their discovery by Rexburg LE and FBI Agents. Tylee\u2019s body had been dismembered and showed evidence that someone had tried to burn her remains. JJ was buried on Chad Daybell\u2019s property. LE found his remains in a shallow grave and covered with Concrete Bricks and wood panelling. JJ\u2019s body was wrapped tightly within a large black trashbag with another white bag covering his head.

      "description": "David Warwick. Who is David Warwick? \n\nSpeaking About His \u201CAlleged\u201D Dreams \u0026 Visions on August 19, 2016, in front of fellow active members of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and \u201Clike-minded people\u201D who are alleged to have gathered and possibly still gather regularly to hear speakers like David Warwick, Shawn Littlebear, Julie Rowe, Chad Daybell, Jason Mow, Rod Meldrum, Melanie Gibb, Lori Vallow Daybell, and so many others. \n\n(For Informational Purposes Only, Not Made For Reproduction, Do Not Copy). \n\nBefore 2019, I had never asked questions like this one. However, in July of 2019, my uncle, Charles Vallow, was senselessly (allegedly) murdered by his estranged wife (now, my former Aunt Lori Vallow Daybell) and her brother, Alex Lamar Cox.  \nMy life changed in an instant. Since that date, I began asking questions into who David Warwick truly is and what exactly is he about.  He and Melanie Gibb married on December 12, 2020. \n\nFun Fact: on December 11, 2019, authorities exhumed the body of Chad Daybell\u2019s former late wife, Tamara \u201CTammy\u201D Douglas Daybell, to perform an autopsy since one wasn\u2019t requested by the Daybell Family.  The elected coroner also failed to order an autopsy at the time of Tammy\u2019s death. It was just automatically ruled as \u201Cnatural causes\u201D by the coroner.\n\nFun Facts: Alex Lamar Cox died on December 12, 2019. \n\n\u2022December 12, 2019,  \nTammy\u2019s body was exhumed, tested, and reinterred. \n\n\u2022David Warwick and Melanie Gibb married one another on the one year death anniversary of Alex Cox. \n\u2022married 12/12/2020",

Grant it, Chad and Lori are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. Until then, I feel it is improtant to take a closer look into the people surrounding them and their religious beliefs. This is for educational purposes only and does not mean these people are guilty. This is just for us to get a better understanding of the chad and lori daybell religious teachings and their core beliefs system. This is part of my personal research which I have name \u201CDifficult Research\u201D bc it has proven to be just that, DIFFICULT! I try to connect as many dots as I possibly can to see if any of chad and lori\u2019s peeps were more involved in murdering my family. Nobody has stepped forward as of today 06/11/2021 and it has been almost two years since murders began. If you havw any information and would like to do the right thing by stepping forward, please contact me via email kresha0123@gmail.com \n\nThank You to everyone who has supported my angel family as well as the rest of us who were left with the burden of living a life sentence of having to live without our lived ones who were allegedly murdered at the hands of the #daybells and #alexcox.

Charles Vallow was my Uncle. Tylee Ryan was the bravest young lady I have ever known. And JJ Vallow, he was my 7 year old autistic nephew. Tylee and JJ were murdered and found buried in shallow graves on the property of Chad Daybell on June 9, 2019. They had been missing for 10 months prior to their discovery by Rexburg LE and FBI Agents. Tylee\u2019s body had been dismembered and showed evidence that someone had tried to burn her remains. JJ was buried on Chad Daybell\u2019s property. LE found his remains in a shallow grave and covered with Concrete Bricks and wood panelling. JJ\u2019s body was wrapped tightly within a large black trashbag with another white bag covering his head. Upon removal of the bags revealed an overt/abundant amount of duct tape covering from his nose area, over mouth, down his arms and hands, and his ankles. He was wearing red pajamas and was found with a baby blue blanket. My Uncle charles had been ambushed and murdered by his brother in law #alexcox in july of 2019. \n\n#lorivallowdaybell #chaddaybell \n\n#difficultresearchwithkresha \n#kreshakayeaston\n#lovealwayswins #justicefortyleeandjj #justiceforcharlesvallow \n#lorivallow #loridaybell #lorivallowdaybell #chaddaybell #daybell \n#alexcox \n#zulemapastenes \n#cox \n#janiscox\n#barrycox\n#summershiflet\n#summershiflett\n#martinluther\n#oprahwinfrey\n#johnthebeloved\n#joeryan\n#tyleeryan\n#jjvallow\n#joshuavallow\n#chandlerpolicedepartment\n#gilbertpolicedepartment\n#mormon #zulema #melaniegibb \n#davidwarwick #churchofthefirstborn \n#jonathonneville \n#timballard #operationundergroundrailroad #hectorsosajr \n#christopherparrett #avrahamgileadi \n#julierowe \n#ericsmith \n#josephryan \n#tammydaybell #Mommydoomsday \n#doomsday \n#gravediggerswife #cult \n#cultmom #cultmomlorivallowdaybell #portals \n#zombies \n#brandonboudreaux #melaniboudreaux #melaniepawlowski #ianpawlowski #difficultresearch \n#difficultconversation #difficult #getcomfortabletalkingaboutuncomfortablethings \n#pathwaytozion #neardeathexperience \n#nde #nde\u2019s #Methuselah #thegatherers\n#gatherer #preppersgonnaprep\n#bishopgabebonilla #nicolebonilla\n#randa #tammydouglas #endoftimes\n#endtimes #prophet #cuddleexpert\n#dark #light #darkcain\n#thechurchofjesuschristandlatterdaysaints \n#lds #presidentnelson #eldernelson \n#mormon #Temple #rituals #murder \n#truecrimecommunity #spiritualabuse #satanicritualabuse #domesticabuse \n#religiousabuse #bloodatonement #callout \n#wheatandtares #christopherparrettsr \n#jasonmow #joelgurvine #denversnuffer #snufferites \n#childmurderers #thesecondcomforter \n#johnpratt \n#mechellemcdermott #jodistoddard #danjudd #tammyjudd #tammijudd #judd #preparingapeople #mikejames #nancyjames #latter_daymedia #comefollowme #vimeo #bitchute #ourawfulsituation #watcherpalmer #millenialreign #firesidechat #mesaarizona #mesatemple #visionsofglory #suzannefreeman #mikeeldervaughnjfeatherstoneletteraseptemberofsorrows #benjaminfaircloth #whitetentcities #thegreatertomorrowrelieffund #timballard #humansextrafficking #operationundergroundrailroad #our\n#firesidechats\n#fireside \n#agreatertomorrow #gri #energyhealing #astralprojection #multiplemortallives #polygamy #josephsmith #rexburgidaho #cardstonprophecy #adamondiahman #shawnlittlebear #rodmeldrum #anothervoiceofwarning #prepper #prepperpride #dreamsofzion #mosiahhancock #wikiwikiup #trimetazidine #ssw #conplan8888usmilitary #zombieplan #theanimal #logicbeforeauthority #smokelesspowder #percentsign #multiplicationsign #kimberlite #cotyledon #nitrocelluloseproduction #thickening #tubalcain #explosionwelding #sodiumphosphate #hyperborea #erniebaron\n#gregchristensen",

Charles Vallow was my Uncle. Tylee Ryan was the bravest young lady I have ever known. And JJ Vallow, he was my 7 year old autistic nephew. Tylee and JJ were murdered and found buried in shallow graves on the property of Chad Daybell on June 9, 2019. They had been missing for 10 months prior to their discovery by Rexburg LE and FBI Agents. Tylee\u2019s body had been dismembered and showed evidence that someone had tried to burn her remains. JJ was buried on Chad Daybell\u2019s property. LE found his remains in a shallow grave and covered with Concrete Bricks and wood panelling. JJ\u2019s body was wrapped tightly within a large black trashbag with another white bag covering his head. Upon removal of the bags revealed an overt/abundant amount of duct tape covering from his nose area, over mouth, down his arms and hands, and his ankles. He was wearing red pajamas and was found with a baby blue blanket. My Uncle charles had been ambushed and murdered by his brother in law #alexcox in july of 2019. \n\n#lorivallowdaybell #chaddaybell \n\n#difficultresearchwithkresha \n#kreshakayeaston\n#lovealwayswins #justicefortyleeandjj #justiceforcharlesvallow \n#lorivallow #loridaybell #lorivallowdaybell #chaddaybell #daybell \n#alexcox #zulemapastenes #cox #janiscox\n#barrycox #summershiflet\n#summershiflett #martinluther\n#oprahwinfrey #johnthebeloved #joeryan\n#tyleeryan #jjvallow #joshuavallow\n#chandlerpolicedepartment\n#gilbertpolicedepartment\n#mormon #zulema #melaniegibb \n#davidwarwick #churchofthefirstborn \n#jonathonneville \n#timballard #operationundergroundrailroad #hectorsosajr \n#christopherparrett #avrahamgileadi \n#julierowe \n#ericsmith #josephryan \n#tammydaybell #Mommydoomsday \n#doomsday #gravediggerswife #cult \n#cultmom #cultmomlorivallowdaybell #portals \n#zombies \n#brandonboudreaux #melaniboudreaux #melaniepawlowski #ianpawlowski #difficultresearch \n#difficultconversation #difficult #getcomfortabletalkingaboutuncomfortablethings \n#pathwaytozion #neardeathexperience \n#nde #nde\u2019s #Methuselah #thegatherers\n#gatherer #preppersgonnaprep\n#bishopgabebonilla #nicolebonilla\n#randa #tammydouglas #endoftimes\n#endtimes #prophet #cuddleexpert\n#dark #light #darkcain\n#thechurchofjesuschristandlatterdaysaints \n#lds #presidentnelson #eldernelson \n#mormon #Temple #rituals #murder \n#truecrimecommunity #spiritualabuse #satanicritualabuse #domesticabuse \n#religiousabuse #bloodatonement #callout \n#wheatandtares #christopherparrettsr \n#jasonmow #joelgurvine #denversnuffer #snufferites \n#childmurderers #thesecondcomforter #johnpratt \n#mechellemcdermott #jodistoddard #danjudd #tammyjudd #tammijudd #judd #preparingapeople #mikejames #nancyjames #latter_daymedia #comefollowme #vimeo #bitchute #ourawfulsituation #watcherpalmer #millenialreign #firesidechat #mesaarizona #mesatemple #visionsofglory #suzannefreeman #mikeeldervaughnjfeatherstoneletteraseptemberofsorrows #benjaminfaircloth #whitetentcities #thegreatertomorrowrelieffund #timballard #humansextrafficking #operationundergroundrailroad #our\n#firesidechats\n#fireside \n#agreatertomorrow #gri #energyhealing #astralprojection #multiplemortallives #polygamy #josephsmith #rexburgidaho #cardstonprophecy #adamondiahman #shawnlittlebear #rodmeldrum #anothervoiceofwarning #prepper #prepperpride #dreamsofzion #mosiahhancock #wikiwikiup #trimetazidine #ssw #conplan8888usmilitary #zombieplan #theanimal #logicbeforeauthority #smokelesspowder #percentsign #multiplicationsign #kimberlite #cotyledon #nitrocelluloseproduction #thickening #tubalcain #explosionwelding #sodiumphosphate #hyperborea #erniebaron\n#gregchristensen #johnpontius #jodistoddard",

      "description": "Charles Vallow Body Cam Footage/01-31-19/GilbertPD... @ this point in time, my uncle, Charles Vallow, had received physical threats from #lorivallow, his wife of 14 years. While away on a regularly scheduled business trip to Texas, Lori had cancelled his return flight home resulting in charles having to purchase a plane ticket just to get back to their home in AZ. Lori had withdrawn $35,000.00 from his business account and moved it to their joint account, then moved the cash one more time into an unknown bank account in which Charles had no access to. This resulted in Charles scrambling to find funds  just to make payroll for his employees/business partners. Lori never returned the $35k back to Charles. Lori  \u0026 \u201Ca friend\u201D who i believe to be #MelanieGibb , conspired with Lori in going to airport in phoenix to steal AND hide #CharlesVallows truck so he would be without transportation upon arriving back from his business trip in Texas. Lori used many forms of sabatoge to make EVERY SINGLE THING MORE DIFFICULT FOR MY UNCLE who was just trying to get home, to his family, just like he had done for the past 14 plus years. He lands at airport in AZ and learns his truck has been taken by Lori. Charles had to call their mutual friend and refers to this friend as  \u201CBishop\u201D. Gabe Bonilla is \u201CBishop\u201D and he picked my uncle up from airport and gave him a ride to the home that Charles and Lori shared together. Charles had to call Gilbert Pd to go through the proper channels in gaining access to his home because Lori had changed the locks as well. I feel its important to watch all footage as much as possible. I know that every time i watch footage from these body cams and court proceedings, I learn something new or pick up on something that I had previously missed. \nNote: Soon after this day 01/31/19, lori and tylee would disappear on a 58 day hiatus. Lori never contacted my uncle charles NOR their son JJ. She abandoned them. She abandoned JJ. \nI wish things would have turned oit different for my nephew JJ, Tylee, and my Uncle Charles. The only thing we can do at this point is to make sure they receive the justice owed to them. #ChadDaybell \u0026  #loridaybell  need to be locked away for life (PLUS BE SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON ON ALL THEIR OTHER MULTIPLE PROBATIONS (lives) ON EVERY PLANET). #Justiceforcharlesvallow #justicefortyleeandjj #justicefortammydaybell #justiceforjosephryan #lovealwayswins #tyleeryan #jjvallow #tammydaybell #josephryan #doomsday #cult #mommydoomsday #cultmom #lds #mormon #alexcox #melaniegibb #melanipawlowski #brandonboudreaux #zulema #pastenes #preparingapeople #anothervoiceofwarning #julierowe #ericsmith #avrahamgileadi #vallow #rexburg #chandler #gilbert #jasonmow #gabebonilla #rodmeldrum #nancyjames #mikejames #hectorsosa #visionsofglory #pontius #mechellemcdermott #latterdaymedia #comefollowme #warchapters #timetowarriorup #murder #falseprophet #god #translatedbeing #ianpawlowski #johnprior #markmeans #robwood #missingkidsfromidaho #kauai #mesatemple #temple #deathpenalty #woodcock #kaywoodcock #larrywoodcock #grandparents #kresha #kreshaeaston #difficultresearch #vallow #daybell #warwick #shawnlittlebear #danjudd #tammyjudd #aprilraymond #latterdaysaints #dreamsofzion #pathwaytozion #ptz #churchofthefirstborn #bloodatonement #ritual #satanic #mikestroud #chellemcdermott #shellygirl #energyhealing #portals #gods #moroni #warchapters #fbi #davidwarwick #priesthood #secretsocieties #secretcombinations #pap #avow #christopherparrett \n\n\n\n\n\n\n ***Kresha0123@gmail.com***\n\n\n#justiceforcharlesvallow #justicefortyleeandjj",

Trish @whitenoiseopedcommentary and I met when Trish had reached out to me as we were frantically trying to find the whereabouts of my nephew JJ Vallow and Tylee Ryan. #wherearethekids signs were plastered all across America and even beyond our borders. I never expected to find such a genuine and compassionate friend while we were in the midst of all this chaos and confusion. I am forever grateful that Trish and I crossed paths. She has been so supportive and so compassionate towards me and my family. She has also helped me with opening up and kept gently nudging me towards actually speaking publicly about how the disappearances and murders of my uncle, nephew, and Tylee had affected me and had forever changed my life. Trish happened to live in Louisiana which is where we reside as well so she put forth so much effort into making this meeting and YouTube video come into fruition. Trish, Like so many others who have been the driving force behind myself and my family, seeking answers and  demanding truths as we have all banded together and journey towards justice for Charles Vallow (uncle), Joshua (JJ) Vallow (nephew), Tylee Ashlynn Ryan \u0026 Tammy Daybell!! \n     This video was a first for both of us and aired on September 30, 2020 (post Hurricane Laura and prior to hurricane Delta). \nTrish and I were both so very nervous but we got through it together and in one piece. \n\nI just want to thank Trish \n @whitenoiseopedcommentary for being such a kind and loving friend to me and for helping me through these darkest times.
