      "description": "In this week\u2019s episode of the Money Magic Podcast, Vangile sits down with Brooke Kekos, an expert in helping women heal from abusive relationships, including financial abuse. Brooke shares her personal journey of enduring abuse from childhood that continued into her adult life, discussing the patterns of control and manipulation she experienced, particularly in financial matters. In this podcast episode Brooke explains financial abuse as a form of control where one partner restricts access to financial resources, making the victim feel powerless. This can involve controlling spending, withholding money, or making financial decisions unilaterally. She also shares her story of growing up with a controlling father and later entering a similar dynamic in her marriage, highlighting how familiarity with such patterns can trap individuals. Brooke also discusses her experiences with religious trauma, having been raised in a cult. She details the impact of this on her sense of self and autonomy, drawing parallels to financial and emotional abuse. The conversation emphasizes the importance of reclaiming autonomy, both financially and personally. Brooke talks about reconnecting with one\u0027s body and intuition through practices like meditation and yoga to heal from abuse. Overall, the episode is a deep dive into the complexities of financial abuse and its intersection with other forms of trauma. This is another insightful podcast. Tune in!
