      "description": "You know what a cult is, and you\u2019d never get tricked into joining one\u2026right? In this video, anthropologist Rob Lemelson debunks common myths and misunderstandings about cults to impart the nuances of marginal religious groups and new religious movements (NRMs). While notorious destructive cults such as the People\u2019s Temple, led by Jim Jones, and Aum Shinrikyo, led by Shoko Asuhara, share certain psychological and social dynamics, not all groups known as cults are destructive\u2013and the differences between cults and organized religions may be less obvious than they seem. \n\nAnthropologists explain how the cult concept has been used to police the racialized and politicized boundaries of legitimate religion and social action, while reinforcing the questionable idea that mainstream religion and political power as a source of moral goodness, benevolence, and protection.\n\nWatch Part 1 on Conspiracies: https://youtu.be/BGpaBQJOvbE",
