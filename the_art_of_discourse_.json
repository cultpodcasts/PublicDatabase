      "description": "In episode 12, we dive headfirst into the twisted world of brainwashing, radicalization, and cults. Examining MAGA, QAnon, and the Barbs, we unpack the intricate ways in which online platforms become breeding grounds for cult-like beliefs. We then delve into Nicki Minaj\u0027s recent 7 day meltdown over feuding with Megan Thee Stallion, using her as the ultimate crash course in narcissism and weaponizing a fan base with nefarious intent.  Lastly, we explore the Netflix documentary \u0022Surviving Twin Flames,\u0022 exposing a cult that manipulates its members through spiritual ideologies and cognitive therapy. Join us for an intriguing exploration of the dark corners where brainwashing and echo chambers converge.
