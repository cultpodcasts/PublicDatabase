      "description": "I infiltrated and exposed a real life cult! Part #1 with my favorite Youtuber @RecklessBen This will be a 15 part series on our channels. We have exposed this evil cult called the 12 tribes and they own a restaurant chain called the Yellow Deli. This cult believes disgusting things and each episode gets crazier and crazier. Our goal is to take this cult down this cult and hopefully save someone. It\u0027s good to show what is happening in the world but its so sad:( \nGo check out @RecklessBen episode 1 it\u0027s amazing! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIJ8keP2g2Q\nThis video is for educational documentary purposes. I don\u0027t support anything that this cult is saying. We are trying to take down the Yellow Deli Cult and expose them for their messed up beliefs. It\u0027s 2022 and I can\u0027t believe people still talk and believe stuff like this. It\u0027s so sad:( Thumbs up this video so we can blow this up and cancel this cult for good. We are trying to make the world better and hopefully we can help someone from this video. \n\nFOLLOW MY INSTAGRAM:) https://www.instagram.com/danny_berk/...\n\nCheck out my Social Media below\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/danny_berk\nSnapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/add/dannyberk\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/dannyberk?lang=en\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dannyberk/",
