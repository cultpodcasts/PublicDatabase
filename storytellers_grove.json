      "description": "I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m pretty freaked out by the growing \u0022manarchy,\u0022 and I think it\u2019s time we use our voices to embody the change we want to see in the world. One of the most insidious things cult leaders do is make you believe that you need them to achieve your goals or that you\u2019re powerless to make a difference. But that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.

It\u2019s deeply unfortunate that Trump pulled us out of the Paris Climate Agreement\u2014talk about selfishness. While the outlook may feel bleak, I\u2019m choosing to hope for the best.
