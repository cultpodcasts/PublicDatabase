      "description": "My incredible quest for this episode is Cheryl Hope, all the way from Canada. Cheryl is a survivor who has not only broken free from the same religious group that I escaped but has also faced horrific abuses within that very same group. Despite all of this, Cheryl has not only built a beautiful life for herself but is also fighting for others who may be subjected to the same traumas she endured, by becoming a pioneer in starting a movement to raise awareness through her remarkable podcast, \u0027Get A Life.\u0027 Her ability to smile and find strength in helping others is truly inspirational.
