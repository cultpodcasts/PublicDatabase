      "description": "Send us a text What if you discovered that marriage books like The Excellent Wife actually follows Steve Hassan\u0027s BITE model of cult indoctrination? And what if these marriage books were giving advice that mirrored coercive control? Bare Marriage podcast, episode 246, featuring Bethany Jantzi. Bethany did her thesis on coercive control, and today she shows us how these books use methods like: diminishing/devaluing personhood; undermining autonomy; creating psychological dependency; using a fear-based system of control; suppressing critical thinking; and conditioning compliance. And all of those things factor into abuse rates and coercive control. And we can do better than this! OUR SPONSOR: It\u0027s the Bible that lets girls see themselves in the story!
