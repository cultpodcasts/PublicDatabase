      "description": "Mark and Bronwyn are back from the DeCult conference, and have some thoughts about their experiences while they were there, and some of the suggestions that had been floated about how to deal with the issue of cults. Mark comes full-circle on the idea of a weirdly shaped straw, Katrina wants to be a super-hero, but is disappointed in the lack of progress science is making to realise her dreams. And Brad gets horsey again, trying to figure out why some of his friends and colleagues pay good money for ineffective equine treatments. Warning: This episode has brief mentions of abuse during the cult segment.
