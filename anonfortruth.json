      "description": "This ex Sea Org member asked to share his story on May 10th. Although his time in the Sea Org was only a small portion of his time in Scientology, the abuses he witnessed were enough to make him leave.\r\n\r\nLeaving was not an easy thing for him to do, and he is afraid of reprisals from the cult if he is identified, so he asked that his appearence and voice be concealed.\r\n\r\nFor more information:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.exseaorg.com/\r\nhttp://www.xenu-directory.net/practices/rpf.html\r\nhttp://www.xenu.net/archive/so/",

      "description": "If the sound is a bit out of sync it\u0027s youtubes fault\r\n\r\nThe scientologists somehow managed to convince the City of London police to censor any signs that contained the word \u0022cult\u0022 \r\n\r\nTo do this they invoked the Public Order Act (1994), a piece of legislation that was replaced in this context by the Racial and Religious Hatred Act (2006). Due to a legal precedent set by a test case under the Public Order Act, it can used to censor signs that actually incite violence. The Racial and Religious Hatred Act (2006) section defines religious hatred as hatred stirred up against a group of people defined by a particular set of religious beliefs. Furthermore, under section 29J (protection of freedom of expression):\r\n\r\n\u0022Nothing in this Part shall be read or given effect in a way which prohibits or restricts discussion, criticism or expressions of antipathy, dislike, ridicule, insult or abuse of particular religions or the beliefs or practices of their adherents, or of any other belief system or the beliefs or practices of its adherents, or proselytising or urging adherents of a different religion or belief system to cease practising their religion or belief system.\u0022\r\n\r\nScientology has been openly condemned as a cult in UK courts, for example:\r\n\r\n\u0022Scientology is both immoral and socially obnoxious...\r\nIt is corrupt sinister and dangerous. It is corrupt because it is based on lies and deceit and has its real objective money and power for Mr. Hubbard... It is sinister because it indulges in infamous practices both to its adherents who do not toe the line unquestionably and to those who criticize it or oppose it. It is dangerous because it is out to capture people and to indoctrinate and brainwash them so they become the unquestioning captives and tools of the cult, withdrawn from ordinary thought, living, and relationships with others.\u0022\r\n\r\n-- Judge Latey, 1984 ruling in the High Court of London \r\n\r\nMembers of the church of scientology have at times been refused entry to this country on the grounds that scientology is socially harmful. \r\n\r\nFor a brief overview: http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/columnists/gary_slapper/article3239734.ece\r\n\r\nTL:DR?
