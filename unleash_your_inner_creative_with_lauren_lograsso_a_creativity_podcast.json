      "description": "This week we continue to take a tour down memory lane with one of the best and most-listened to Unleash episodes of all time! It is with Sadie Blasucci--she shares her journey of making an extremely creative decision: leaving the religion that your parents and community have told you is the \u0022right\u0022 one. For her, that was Mormonism. We need to use our creativity in ALL aspects of life, not just work. Questioning the script that has been given to you about life, God, love--that\u0027s part of it. Tune in for a fascinating conversation and for tips on finding yourself and spirituality when you leave the religious and/or cultural framework you were raised in. Original Description: On The Guest: Sadie Blasucci is a former Mormon and Faith Transition Coach that helps people acclimate after leaving the church. She\u2019s also the co-host of Missionary Podcast and co-author of a Faith Crisis Guided Journal titled My Authentic Faith. Her focus is to teach people to find faith, trust, and happiness within themselves. From this conversation you\u2019ll learn: The origin of Mormonism \u0026 other interesting Mormon facts The process of unlearning childhood traumas How to find happiness outside of your spiritual community and take responsibility for it How habit swapping can help in transitional phases The purpose of secrecy in Mormonism The difference between organized religion and finding your own spirituality How to process Spiritual grieving The idea of worthiness in Mormonism Tools for faith transitioning And so much more!
