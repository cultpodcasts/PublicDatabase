She a wealth of knowledge and her perspective is fascinating when it comes to the psychology behind people who get swept up into commercial cults. She knows it from the lens of a psychotherapist but also as someone who was in one for 10 years, the same one Sandy was in the longest! Brandie is a mother of two based in Toronto, a psychotherapist in clinical supervision, and President of \u201CFlipping the Pyramid,\u201D a non-profit peer support group committed to aiding individuals in their recovery from commercial cults. As an MLM recovery advocate, Brandie believes everyone deserves freedom of mind and speaks out against the abuses of power and coercion perpetrated by MLM scams.
