      "description": "When targeted, narcissists and psychopaths relish smear campaigns because these provide them with attention, excitement and thrills; justify their grandiose paranoid ideation; legitimize their aggression; and affirm their victimhood. They do not experience shame, remorse, intimidation, chastisement, or fear (even if they pretend otherwise), but rage and elation.\n\nTruth can also be a smear campaign when taken out of context (decontextualized)\n\nForm of gangstalking, narrative role-reversal (victimhood)\n\nExample of smear campaign instigator triadic dynamics:\n\nSmear campaigns involve pathetic losers. \n\nPsychopathic cult leader masquerading as a benevolent guru: self-righteous moralizing to disguise the projection. The inducer. Unable to maintain long-term relationships, especially with intimate partners. Substance user.\n\nFaded bloated past their prime histrionic, failed wannabe impostor, pretending to be an investigative journalist, expert, or researcher to lend an air of faux professionalism and objectivity to her or his pursuit of narcissistic supply and celebrity. Sublimates her paranoia as a form of ostentatious faux courage. The exploiter. Could be more than one.\n\nEternal cult member with a cult mind to blindly follow orders down the cult leader\u2019s rabbit hole in return for a sense of belonging to an extended family, friendship, intimacy, and being accepted warts, shortcomings, repulsiveness, and all. The slave. Could be more than one.\n\nThe shapeshifting triumvirate recruits people with grievances, real or imagined, to do their bidding and act as cannon fodder or flying monkeys. \n\nProselytizers vs. Disseminators: canonical text, exegesis and deconstruction, embellishments \n\nAll smear campaigns are conspiracy theories. Narrative themes of smear campaign are folkloric: sexual abuse, fraud, malice, comeuppance, morality play of good vs. evil.\n\nCultlike dynamics (for me or against me, friend or foe, chosen few, privileged information and arcane knowledge)\n\nInducer in shared psychosis and narcissist in shared fantasy\n\nPreemptive epistemic injury (real victim disbelieved): victim confused, isolated, questions own sanity and reality\n\nCreating unsafe environment\n\nInvolved mentally disturbed people, self-enhancement, defense against ego-dystonic shame and guilt, loss, and nuance\n\nRescuer-savior, crusader complex\n\nSplitting, self-splitting, and projection (of both traits and actions), reaction formation\n\nHarvesting sympathy, allegiance, loyalty, commitment, validation, soothing, empowerment\n\nExternalized aggression (e.g., revenge for shaming humiliation, esp. in public), virulent envy\n\u2003\nFind and Buy MOST of my BOOKS and eBOOKS in my Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/60F8EC8A-5812-4007-9F2C-DFA02EA713B3\n\nWATCH Smear Campaign: Turn Narcissist\u0027s Flying Monkeys Against Him/Her https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvcElTrz4s4\n\nSmear campaigns are premeditated, calculated, relentless: psychopathic (antisocial)\n\n",

      "description": "People with a disorganized erratic cluster B personality disorder create simultaneous but mutually exclusive narratives of their lives intended to manage dissonance, both internal and external (with reality). These narratives are the equivalents of self-states or \u201Cmultiple\u201D personalities (subpersonalities).\n\nExamples of such narratives: I am normal, I have a loving family, I am promiscuous, I am a psychopath. \n\nWhen these narratives collapse, the disordered person allocates them to his/her nearest and dearest as if these were theatre productions or movies (e.g., the narcissist\u2019s shared fantasy). The role of these actors is to validate the reality of the narratives (the same function of narcissistic supply in NPD). \n\nThe actors dissociate (depersonalize and derealize) within the fantasy. \nBecause these actors are misperceived as internal objects, offloading the narratives onto them unburdens the disordered person. The actions of the actors or agents are owned by the disordered person without the attendant risks or adverse consequences.\n\nWhen the actors regain independence, agency, and personal autonomy, they become persecutory objects and the disordered person experiences narcissistic mortification. \n\nThe disordered person attempts to hoover them or to co-opt anyone new in their lives. Should this strategy fail, they try to destroy the frustrating objects.\n\nFind and Buy MOST of my BOOKS and eBOOKS in my Amazon Store: \nhttps://www.amazon.com/stores/page/60F8EC8A-5812-4007-9F2C-DFA02EA713B3",

The impact the narcissist is having on people\u2019s lives, for better or for worse, is a mere by-product or a side effect of his/her pursuit of grandiosity-affirming narcissistic, sadistic, or self-supply. \n\nDo you care about me? Narcissist: I do. You are useful to me. But, don\u2019t you have emotions for me? N: I don\u2019t do emotions. I do relationship maintenance. I do business: give and take. So, why stay in touch? N: I owe you. I repay my debts. Plus, you could still be useful. \n\nTheir shared fantasy is inverted; they start with hatebombing, devaluation and discard (the whole point of the fantasy), mixed with negative idealization (mythological demonization). So, their fantasies are extremely short, nasty, and brutal.\n\nIn rare cases, when the potential partner is also a malignant or sadistic narcissist, they become codependent or borderline, though still manifesting dysregulated abuse and coercive behaviors. \n\nIn such inverted shared fantasies, they transition to the role of a victim, letting the counterparty initiate the separation by betraying them (betrayal fantasy). \n\nFind and Buy MOST of my BOOKS and eBOOKS in my Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/60F8EC8A-5812-4007-9F2C-DFA02EA713B3",

The narcissist then proceeds to extract narcissistic supply from other people in order to validate the reality of the False Self: he acts like a missionary trying to convert his sources of supply into his private religion or cult.
