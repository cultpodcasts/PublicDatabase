      "description": "People with a disorganized erratic cluster B personality disorder create simultaneous but mutually exclusive narratives of their lives intended to manage dissonance, both internal and external (with reality). These narratives are the equivalents of self-states or \u201Cmultiple\u201D personalities (subpersonalities).\n\nExamples of such narratives: I am normal, I have a loving family, I am promiscuous, I am a psychopath. \n\nWhen these narratives collapse, the disordered person allocates them to his/her nearest and dearest as if these were theatre productions or movies (e.g., the narcissist\u2019s shared fantasy). The role of these actors is to validate the reality of the narratives (the same function of narcissistic supply in NPD). \n\nThe actors dissociate (depersonalize and derealize) within the fantasy. \nBecause these actors are misperceived as internal objects, offloading the narratives onto them unburdens the disordered person. The actions of the actors or agents are owned by the disordered person without the attendant risks or adverse consequences.\n\nWhen the actors regain independence, agency, and personal autonomy, they become persecutory objects and the disordered person experiences narcissistic mortification. \n\nThe disordered person attempts to hoover them or to co-opt anyone new in their lives. Should this strategy fail, they try to destroy the frustrating objects.\n\nFind and Buy MOST of my BOOKS and eBOOKS in my Amazon Store: \nhttps://www.amazon.com/stores/page/60F8EC8A-5812-4007-9F2C-DFA02EA713B3",

The impact the narcissist is having on people\u2019s lives, for better or for worse, is a mere by-product or a side effect of his/her pursuit of grandiosity-affirming narcissistic, sadistic, or self-supply. \n\nDo you care about me? Narcissist: I do. You are useful to me. But, don\u2019t you have emotions for me? N: I don\u2019t do emotions. I do relationship maintenance. I do business: give and take. So, why stay in touch? N: I owe you. I repay my debts. Plus, you could still be useful. \n\nTheir shared fantasy is inverted; they start with hatebombing, devaluation and discard (the whole point of the fantasy), mixed with negative idealization (mythological demonization). So, their fantasies are extremely short, nasty, and brutal.\n\nIn rare cases, when the potential partner is also a malignant or sadistic narcissist, they become codependent or borderline, though still manifesting dysregulated abuse and coercive behaviors. \n\nIn such inverted shared fantasies, they transition to the role of a victim, letting the counterparty initiate the separation by betraying them (betrayal fantasy). \n\nFind and Buy MOST of my BOOKS and eBOOKS in my Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/60F8EC8A-5812-4007-9F2C-DFA02EA713B3",

The child sacrifices his true self to the false self in return for the latter\u0027s grandiose fantasies and defelection of the pain and hurt suffered by the traumatized child. The narcissist then proceeds to extract narcissistic supply from other people in order to validate the reality of the False Self: he acts like a missionary trying to convert his sources of supply into his private religion or cult. As more people became narcissists, narcissism turned into an organizing and explanatory principle of human societies everywhere, imbuing the narcissists\u0027 life with meaning and prescribing or proscribing behavior and technological progress.
