      "description": "Narcissism is a primitive religion and the narcissist is its implacable deity which demands human sacrifice. \n\nThe messages of the narcissist are religious and missionary.\n\nThe narcissist\u0027s Ten Commandments: \n\nYou will acknowledge my superiority, uniqueness, and perfection and you will dwell in the promised land of the shared fantasy\n\nMy speech and conduct are beyond reproach and never to be doubted, challenged, or criticized. I am the yardstick of all that is just and true, the sole giver of the Law, your absolute master. \n\nYou are my creation, you exist only through me and in me, you will never deviate, divert, contradict, or challenge who I made you to be\n\nI mediate between you and reality, nothing is veritable until I decree it and make it so\n\nI am your entire world, you need no one else but me\n\nServing and adulating me elevates and improves you, makes you a better, self-actualized version of yourself\n\nI expect your unconditional love and unalloyed devotion even when you are tested and are called to sacrifice yourself \n\nYou will fear my punishment and retribution if you were to break any of these commandments. You will avoid all situations, circumstances, and environments which may lead you astray. \n\nYou are the sinner and I am the redeemer: whatever goes wrong is your fault; I am your savior, rescuer, healer, fixer, and protector\n\nNever deviate from these commandments and you will have a happy life.

But the flying monkey also serves as savior-rescuer and maternal protective figure. \n\nNarcissist devalues, discards, and punishes vicariously, by proxy, through the agency of the flying monkey, the narcissist\u2019s long arm, an extension of his omnipotence. Flying monkeys, therefore, buttress the narcissist\u2019s grandiosity.\n \nThe flying monkey experiences the shared fantasy the way an intimate partner does: feel chosen, unique, omnipotent, in the know, thrilled/excited/aroused, useful (needed), legitimized.\n\nFind and Buy MOST of my BOOKS and eBOOKS in my Amazon Store: \nhttps://www.amazon.com/stores/page/60F8EC8A-5812-4007-9F2C-DFA02EA713B3",

      "description": "People with a disorganized erratic cluster B personality disorder create simultaneous but mutually exclusive narratives of their lives intended to manage dissonance, both internal and external (with reality). These narratives are the equivalents of self-states or \u201Cmultiple\u201D personalities (subpersonalities).\n\nExamples of such narratives: I am normal, I have a loving family, I am promiscuous, I am a psychopath. \n\nWhen these narratives collapse, the disordered person allocates them to his/her nearest and dearest as if these were theatre productions or movies (e.g., the narcissist\u2019s shared fantasy). The role of these actors is to validate the reality of the narratives (the same function of narcissistic supply in NPD). \n\nThe actors dissociate (depersonalize and derealize) within the fantasy. \nBecause these actors are misperceived as internal objects, offloading the narratives onto them unburdens the disordered person. The actions of the actors or agents are owned by the disordered person without the attendant risks or adverse consequences.\n\nWhen the actors regain independence, agency, and personal autonomy, they become persecutory objects and the disordered person experiences narcissistic mortification. \n\nThe disordered person attempts to hoover them or to co-opt anyone new in their lives. Should this strategy fail, they try to destroy the frustrating objects.\n\nFind and Buy MOST of my BOOKS and eBOOKS in my Amazon Store: \nhttps://www.amazon.com/stores/page/60F8EC8A-5812-4007-9F2C-DFA02EA713B3",

      "description": "Locus of grandiosity of malignant (psychopathic) and sadistic narcissists is their invulnerability, unemotionality, flat attachment, rigidity, and heartless cruelty (disguised as altruism, if prosocial).\n\nThey are transactional:\n\nTo the narcissist, all people are useful tools (in both senses of the word) or collateral damage. The impact the narcissist is having on people\u2019s lives, for better or for worse, is a mere by-product or a side effect of his/her pursuit of grandiosity-affirming narcissistic, sadistic, or self-supply. \n\nDo you care about me? Narcissist: I do. You are useful to me. But, don\u2019t you have emotions for me? N: I don\u2019t do emotions. I do relationship maintenance. I do business: give and take. So, why stay in touch? N: I owe you. I repay my debts. Plus, you could still be useful. \n\nTheir shared fantasy is inverted; they start with hatebombing, devaluation and discard (the whole point of the fantasy), mixed with negative idealization (mythological demonization). So, their fantasies are extremely short, nasty, and brutal.\n\nIn rare cases, when the potential partner is also a malignant or sadistic narcissist, they become codependent or borderline, though still manifesting dysregulated abuse and coercive behaviors. \n\nIn such inverted shared fantasies, they transition to the role of a victim, letting the counterparty initiate the separation by betraying them (betrayal fantasy). \n\nFind and Buy MOST of my BOOKS and eBOOKS in my Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/60F8EC8A-5812-4007-9F2C-DFA02EA713B3",

The child sacrifices his true self to the false self in return for the latter\u0027s grandiose fantasies and defelection of the pain and hurt suffered by the traumatized child. The narcissist then proceeds to extract narcissistic supply from other people in order to validate the reality of the False Self: he acts like a missionary trying to convert his sources of supply into his private religion or cult. As more people became narcissists, narcissism turned into an organizing and explanatory principle of human societies everywhere, imbuing the narcissists\u0027 life with meaning and prescribing or proscribing behavior and technological progress. Narcissism is the newest faith and its godhead is a distributed, network deity with each node in the network - each narcissist - a god unto himself.\n\n(From the book \u0022Malignant Self-love: Narcissism Revisited\u0022 by Sam Vaknin - Click on this link to purchase the print book, or 16 e-books, or 3 DVDs with 16 hours of video lectures on narcissists, psychopaths, and abuse in relationships: http://www.narcissistic-abuse.com/thebook.html)",

Like other gurus, he demands complete obedience from his flock: his spouse, his offspring, other family members, friends, and colleagues. He feels entitled to adulation and special treatment by his followers. He punishes the wayward and the straying lambs. He enforces discipline, adherence to his teachings, and common goals. The less accomplished he is in reality -- the more stringent his mastery and the more pervasive the brainwashing.
