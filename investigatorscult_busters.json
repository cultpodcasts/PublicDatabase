      "description": "Jean Dixon the world famous psychic was well respected and former presidents invited her to the White House and conferred with her. Her very famous John F. Kennedy assassination prediction was made in May 1956 published in Parade newspaper magazine May 13,1956. \uFFFC We verified this issue with www.loc.gov. The library of Congress website to make sure that this issue in fact, had this article. \uFFFC she made other notable predictions, and also had some failures as most psychics do misinterpret \uFFFCtheir own premonitions. But one thing that is documented, is that Jean Dixon\u2019s beat Henry Kinley to the punch on the JFK assassination prediction. It was commonly reported that Kinley claim to predict the assassination of John F Kennedy, 1958. Wilbur Carr disputed that claim saying it was 1957. \uFFFC But Jean Dixon predicted this in May 1956. Did HCK hear about this? One can only speculate. In any case, he wasn\u2019t the exclusive owner of the prediction.  I will begin to look closer at some of his other big predictions and let you know what we find out!",

At the same time you\uFFFC deny the Holy Spirit is a man. Although you persist to give him a defined location. Banning, CA and LA IDMR classes do you have prayers, in the name of a Henry C. Kinley at the start of classes, and then persist to \uFFFCconstantly mention the name \uFFFCHenry C Kinley, instead of Yahweh, Elohim and Yahshua.  Yet insist, they do not worship a man. And then will say if you don\u2019t have the spirit of this man in you, you are a \u201Cdamn fool.\u201D  This dissonance of logic causes inner turmoil within the psyche of the individual. The outward divisions and contentious behaviors are due to their inner conflict.",

Our team has sent letters to them as written requests for proof, responses were  inconclusive. \uFFFC Will Williams from the Oceanside ranch spoken before his class over a year ago telling a story that he personally visited Fisk University and asked for a copy of the honorary doctorate. They told them they would research it and get back to him. When he went back, they told him that they did not have it. \uFFFC But if they didn\u2019t have, it may be a cat lost, \uFFFCwhich was his only hope that it actually might\u2019ve existed. \uFFFC But isn\u2019t it strange that even in the aliens are history video, they did not produce a copy of the certificate? They gave no date in time in 1947 on the commencement. These are usually given at a ceremony there was no pictures of any reception or anything, instead they showed a postcard that he sent to his sister telling him about his trip to Fisk University saying that he thought the University would be of some help to the school. But there\u2019s not even any written message related to the honorary doctorate.  \n\n\uFFFC So we are selves now call Fisk. \uFFFC I would\u2019ve thought that many others would have been inquiring of this. \uFFFC Maybe they don\u2019t, because they don\u2019t really want to know the answer.",

Some make this an excuse to reinterpret HCK\u2019s intended meaning by statement of \u201C You won\u2019t see 2000\u201D and escape from responsibility for derailing the lives of the students with a false doomsday. If HCK meant something else other than Gregorian 2000, why was he not careful to avoid the ambiguity of conflicting meanings, unless he himself, was not sure? If he was actually sure, then apparently he intended to unnecessarily disrupt the lives of those who would live to see 2000 pass by multiple decades. Is this a bizarre torture test? Is this the grace of our benevolent advocate? Or intentional sabotage?",

But was always amazed that after these predictions failed, so many glossed over the tragedies of members being dissuaded from making responsible decisions, and plans for their futures. Nobody talks about it and it\u2019s the elephant in every room that these lectures are given.",

Then he later changed the year for the end of the world, to be 2010..saying that it would be a Jubilee (50 years) from 1960. \uFFFC Because 1960 was a date that the founder Henry C. Kinley said was the chronological end,\uFFFC and that we are now in a \u201C grace period\u201D .. this said grace period was \uFFFCa term also used by a cult known as Branhamism, a cult founded by Joseph Branham, who predicted that 1977 would be the end of the word, before he himself died in 1965. After the failed prediction, his followers decided that Joseph had went on into heaven to prepare a place for them, and that they were in a \u201Cgrace period\u201D.. \uFFFC his followers instead became stronger and said, \u201C..isn\u2019t it great that we now have a chance to get it right!\u201D \uFFFC I have heard the exact same words spoken by members of the IDMR, when they speak of the \u201C grace period \u201C. \uFFFC you would think that after Dr. Harris had made so many blatant wrong predictions, that his followers would have diminished, or quit altogether, but that\u2019s not the case! \uFFFC They continued on like there wasn\u2019t anything wrong! It\u2019s the elephant in the rooms that nobody admits to. Instead, they make excuses, and blame themselves for not really understanding what he actually meant!

      "description": "It\u2019s notable that the video we are critiquing, banners \u201CDr. Henry C. Kinley: God in a body,\u201D but most frames, and the featured frame, is of Dr. Robert Harris. This is because this particular camp believes Robert Harris is actually Henry C. Kinley. That\u2019s why their catch phrase is: \u201CDr. Kinley hasn\u2019t gone anywhere .\u201D this is what\u2019s called in cult psychology, \u201C a thought terminating clich\u00E9 \u201D, but with an obscure meaning. It\u2019s a toxic concept, that imposes that \u201CHenry C. Kinley\u201D is some sort of \u201CAvatar \u201C , meaning a released soul and or deity that was incarnate on Earth in a new body. That body being \u201CDr. Robert Harris \u201C. Who has since passed. It\u2019s a spooky concept, and keeps the focus on a particular physical man. Instead of the universal spiritual aspect. One recorded testimony from an attendee at the New Orleans branch, said the Dean of that school, claimed in 1994, to see and meet Dr. Kinley in a hotel room, and hugged him , and as he looked again realized it was Dr. Robert Harris he was hugging. So to him was a transformation of one man into another\u2026 Dr. Henry C. Kinley had passed in 1976. So this alleged experience was 18 years after. These sorts of toxic concepts, promote cognitive dissonance. On top of this, Robert Harris made a series of wrong end of the world predictions. This was extremely reckless and damaging to the lives of the IDMR members. A man in the top position of the institution, dissuading, and derailing the lives of its members!",
