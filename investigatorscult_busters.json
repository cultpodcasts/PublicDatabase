      "description": "The other ridiculous notion is that if Kinley\u2019s  book was examined by the pope or his associates, and if it incriminated the pope, as Kinley claimed it did, why of all things would he bring that book to the ecumenical council? If anything they would\u2019ve tucked that book in a file cabinet someplace. It\u2019s very doubtful that the pope himself ever even had his hands on the book. People don\u2019t realize that you don\u2019t mail anything directly to the pope. IDMR sent that book to the Vatican unsolicited. The clergy weren\u2019t sitting around waiting for this book to show up. Likely it went right into the garbage with all the rest of the random things mailed into the pope. Not saying the book wasn\u2019t worth reading, but it\u2019s extremely doubtful that an unsolicited book like that would even be considered to be forwarded to the pope. This is just another one of those overstated claims that Henry Kinley made. It\u2019s unfalsifiable, we cannot prove nor disprove if that book ever even made it to the pope. What we do now is the ecumenical council was planned in 1958 years before Kinley even started to write the book. So it definitely wasn\u2019t the reason why they called the meeting. There\u2019s other plausible reasons why they called the meeting. Post World War II the new generation of baby boomers were threatening away from the church. By 1961 \uFFFC more than 90% of households had televisions. Interstate highways were being completed. Commercial airlines were available to the public. Suburbanization etc. The world was changing and the Catholic Church knew they were falling behind the trends. They knew they had to make some adjustments too try to win back the attention of it\u2019s drifting attendances.",

      "title": "\uFFFCThe Night Henry Kinley Made Stars Fall: What You Didn\u2019t Know",
      "description": "The date of \u201CMarch 19, 1924\u201D was the day Henry\u2019s son Richard died. As the legend was told Henry feeling dismayed that he had \u201Chealed others\u201C, but couldn\u2019t save his son. Henry went out onto the porch and questioned within himself, asking God if he was punishing him. He said he needed a sign. So Henry picked out a star and said \u201CGod if I\u2019m called to be a minister make that star fall. \u201C Allegedly as he claimed that star fell. He went on to pick two more, the final third time was the biggest brightest star he could find in the sky. The legend is when that star fell. He fell out of his chair. Quite a dramatic story. But it can\u2019t be true at all. An IDMR member might say I\u2019m trusting the science, and that Yahweh is greater than man\u2019s science. But this just doesn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s not that I lack of faith. It\u2019s that this is a made up story.\n\nHere\u2019s why! Stars don\u2019t fall ever! Shooting stars or meteorites, are not stars, but pieces of rock that made its way into our atmosphere and burns up. It\u2019s only noticed because it\u2019s on fire flying by at extreme velocities. When Henry was claiming to do was that he pointed at actual orbited massive stars, of which would make our son look like the size of a pea next to a basketball. The stars, like our Sun have planets, orbiting around them with moons orbiting around those planets. Henry was trying to tell his audiences that entire solar systems were somehow falling in real observable time. Fall ? Fall where? \uFFFCSpace is relative to itself. Nothing falls in space. \n\nThis claim of his, showed  his complete lack of understanding. The unfathomable distances of stars determine that no star could be seen as falling in observable time.",

      "description": "This is one of many places you can find Henry Kinley telling his devoted audience statements like \u201Cyou won\u2019t see 2000\u201D. Many have disputed that he didn\u2019t mean the Gregorian calendar 2000. Here we see he\u2019s plainly illustrating that that is exactly what he meant 2000 A.D. It\u2019s referring to the year that just passed 25 years ago. Here in this particular transcript he\u2019s not calling out Pentecost or the four-year error. But that the 6000 year timeframe only includes 120 Jubilees or 50 year cycles. Then in other places, he said \u201Cyou\u2019ll never see it\u201D. Because this age will need to be cut short referring to the verse in Matthew 24:22. There\u2019s no ambiguity and this is not open to interpretation. It\u2019s plainly stated by H.C. Kinley that there would only be a total of 6000 years or 120 Jubilee\u2019s, and that that would even be cut short. So the question we should ask is why are we not referring to Deuteronomy 18:22 ? But of course, realizing so many have invested their entire lifetime in a belief system centered around the IDMR \u2018s teaching, the cognitive dissonance upon realizing that Henry Kinley profess something that did not come through on your mind, his divine authority. As it turns out. Therefore, most will just find a reason to dismiss this and re-interpret it saying that there are some special way of understanding this.",

He was a dedicated IDMR minister, and a very popular speaker. To his family and friends, we are sorry for your loss. Kieth Gilkey subsequently spoke May 19, 2024 and the latest failed doomsday prediction said to be told by Aaron Bryant himself quoted as \u201CWhen I go, we all go\u201D\u2026was the elephant in the room. In this lecture we hear Dr. Kieth Gilkey (presumed to be the new International Dean) , go about to justify why lDMR \u2018s \uFFFC false doomsdays were actually good for the students to keep the end of the world on their minds. Rather than admit that they made up detrimental concepts that derailed lives, and destroyed future plans unnecessarily . But IDMR Headquarters instead posture themselves as if they are still right, and the predictions are never called false.",

      "description": "Jean Dixon the world famous psychic was well respected and former presidents invited her to the White House and conferred with her. Her very famous John F. Kennedy assassination prediction was made in May 1956 published in Parade newspaper magazine May 13,1956. \uFFFC We verified this issue with www.loc.gov. The library of Congress website to make sure that this issue in fact, had this article. \uFFFC she made other notable predictions, and also had some failures as most psychics do misinterpret \uFFFCtheir own premonitions. But one thing that is documented, is that Jean Dixon\u2019s beat Henry Kinley to the punch on the JFK assassination prediction. It was commonly reported that Kinley claim to predict the assassination of John F Kennedy, 1958. Wilbur Carr disputed that claim saying it was 1957. \uFFFC But Jean Dixon predicted this in May 1956. Did HCK hear about this? One can only speculate. In any case, he wasn\u2019t the exclusive owner of the prediction.  I will begin to look closer at some of his other big predictions and let you know what we find out!",

Our team has sent letters to them as written requests for proof, responses were  inconclusive. \uFFFC Will Williams from the Oceanside ranch spoken before his class over a year ago telling a story that he personally visited Fisk University and asked for a copy of the honorary doctorate. They told them they would research it and get back to him. When he went back, they told him that they did not have it. \uFFFC But if they didn\u2019t have, it may be a cat lost, \uFFFCwhich was his only hope that it actually might\u2019ve existed. \uFFFC But isn\u2019t it strange that even in the aliens are history video, they did not produce a copy of the certificate? They gave no date in time in 1947 on the commencement. These are usually given at a ceremony there was no pictures of any reception or anything, instead they showed a postcard that he sent to his sister telling him about his trip to Fisk University saying that he thought the University would be of some help to the school. But there\u2019s not even any written message related to the honorary doctorate.  \n\n\uFFFC So we are selves now call Fisk. \uFFFC I would\u2019ve thought that many others would have been inquiring of this. \uFFFC Maybe they don\u2019t, because they don\u2019t really want to know the answer.",

This one scaphoid is what\u2019s called \u201Ccherry picked\u201D, due to bias. \uFFFC If the 8 bones signify that there were \uFFFC8 souls ( human beings) in the Ark, then if one bone represents the ark, then there\u2019s only 7 passengers. The comparison to story doesn\u2019t really work.\n\nOftentimes Dr. Harris in volume 3 seems to cherry pick certain correlations about the anatomy, that otherwise have no relevance to the story. Such as the wrist in the human body. There\u2019s nothing about Noah\u2019s ark or his family that had anything to do with your hand and your wrist your arm or anything. \uFFFC but somehow people are dazzled and I believe it is activated by confirmation bias.",

While under this dean , the students underwent a terrible plight of perpetual doom , peppered with a series of wrong specified , but false predictions ? Observing this all objectively, it served no useful purpose. If one is to justify this by saying HCK foretold this horrible disaster of His own work thru men he himself raised, and saying that this foretelling made it purposeful. Then I\u2019d say he tortured His own body for no good useful gain. Only a cruel experiment.

I was there and that\u2019s the one I mistakenly referred to as being Chicago. \n\nDoes anyone think how bad the false predictions of the doomsday, destroyed lives? Long time leaders of IDMR such as Dr. Harris made a series of wrong predictions that misled members to make life altering decisions causing terrible consequences. I attended these lectures for years. But was always amazed that after these predictions failed, so many glossed over the tragedies of members being dissuaded from making responsible decisions, and plans for their futures. Nobody talks about it and it\u2019s the elephant in every room that these lectures are given.",

Then he later changed the year for the end of the world, to be 2010..saying that it would be a Jubilee (50 years) from 1960. \uFFFC Because 1960 was a date that the founder Henry C. Kinley said was the chronological end,\uFFFC and that we are now in a \u201C grace period\u201D .. this said grace period was \uFFFCa term also used by a cult known as Branhamism, a cult founded by Joseph Branham, who predicted that 1977 would be the end of the word, before he himself died in 1965. After the failed prediction, his followers decided that Joseph had went on into heaven to prepare a place for them, and that they were in a \u201Cgrace period\u201D.. \uFFFC his followers instead became stronger and said, \u201C..isn\u2019t it great that we now have a chance to get it right!\u201D \uFFFC I have heard the exact same words spoken by members of the IDMR, when they speak of the \u201C grace period \u201C. \uFFFC you would think that after Dr. Harris had made so many blatant wrong predictions, that his followers would have diminished, or quit altogether, but that\u2019s not the case! \uFFFC They continued on like there wasn\u2019t anything wrong! It\u2019s the elephant in the rooms that nobody admits to. Instead, they make excuses, and blame themselves for not really understanding what he actually meant! This is all \u201CCult psychology 101.\u201D",

      "description": "It\u2019s notable that the video we are critiquing, banners \u201CDr. Henry C. Kinley: God in a body,\u201D but most frames, and the featured frame, is of Dr. Robert Harris. This is because this particular camp believes Robert Harris is actually Henry C. Kinley. That\u2019s why their catch phrase is: \u201CDr. Kinley hasn\u2019t gone anywhere .\u201D this is what\u2019s called in cult psychology, \u201C a thought terminating clich\u00E9 \u201D, but with an obscure meaning. It\u2019s a toxic concept, that imposes that \u201CHenry C. Kinley\u201D is some sort of \u201CAvatar \u201C , meaning a released soul and or deity that was incarnate on Earth in a new body. That body being \u201CDr. Robert Harris \u201C. Who has since passed. It\u2019s a spooky concept, and keeps the focus on a particular physical man. Instead of the universal spiritual aspect. One recorded testimony from an attendee at the New Orleans branch, said the Dean of that school, claimed in 1994, to see and meet Dr. Kinley in a hotel room, and hugged him , and as he looked again realized it was Dr. Robert Harris he was hugging. So to him was a transformation of one man into another\u2026 Dr. Henry C. Kinley had passed in 1976. So this alleged experience was 18 years after. These sorts of toxic concepts, promote cognitive dissonance. On top of this, Robert Harris made a series of wrong end of the world predictions. This was extremely reckless and damaging to the lives of the IDMR members. A man in the top position of the institution, dissuading, and derailing the lives of its members!",
