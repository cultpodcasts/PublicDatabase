      "description": "In this episode of Cultured Boy, I share my raw, unfiltered take on the Renee Nicole Good situation and what it reveals about how we process truth in a polarized culture. Drawing from my background growing up in a fundamentalist Mormon cult, I explain why I\u2019m obsessed with questioning narratives instead of blindly choosing sides. As new footage and perspectives emerge, I walk you through my own changing reactions and the uncomfortable accountability that often gets ignored. This isn\u2019t about defending a camp\u2014it\u2019s about confronting how fast tragedy happens and how certainty can become dangerous. My real aim here is simple: less tribalism, more truth, and a deeper commitment to seeing people as the full human beings that they are.\n\nPlease like, comment, and most importantly--SUBSCRIBE!

Despite being family, we spent over 30 years completely unaware of each other. Why? Because our families were split apart by different branches of fundamentalist Mormonism.\uD83D\uDC49 We unpack how Mormon history led to that split, what it was like to grow up with 44 siblings vs. 35 siblings, and how belief systems can divide\u2014even across the same bloodline.\uD83D\uDC49 We explore the doctrine, the history, the \u201Cgreat split,\u201D and the very human cost of growing up in isolated religious communities.\uD83D\uDC49 Most of all, we reflect on what it means to leave behind certainty and step into curiosity, freedom, and self-discovery.This conversation is deeply personal, but it\u2019s also universal. Whether you\u2019ve left a religion, a relationship, or just the \u201Cscript\u201D you were handed\u2014you\u2019ll see reflections of your own journey here.\uD83D\uDCFA Watch Sam\u2019s channel here: YouTube.com/@GrowingUpinPolygamy\u2726 Subscribe for more stories like this: YouTube.com/@officialcalvinwayman\u2726 Follow me on Instagram: @calvinwayman\u23F1\uFE0F Timestamps00:00:00 \u2013 Meeting family for the 1st time \u2708\uFE0F00:00:31 \u2013 Wait\u2026we\u2019re actually first cousins?! \uD83E\uDD2F00:01:40 \u2013 44 siblings vs. 35 siblings \uD83D\uDC68\u200D\uD83D\uDC69\u200D\uD83D\uDC67\u200D\uD83D\uDC6600:02:33 \u2013 Mormonism \u0026 why polygamy mattered \uD83D\uDC8D00:06:01 \u2013 Celestial law \u0026 multiple heavens \u2601\uFE0F00:07:04 \u2013 Joseph Smith\u2019s angel with a sword \u2694\uFE0F00:09:25 \u2013 The Manifesto: when polygamy \u201Cended\u201D \uD83D\uDCDC00:12:58 \u2013 The fork in the road: LDS vs. Fundamentalists \uD83D\uDEE4\uFE0F00:16:55 \u2013 Our great-grandfather \u0026 the Council of Friends \uD83D\uDC7400:20:17 \u2013 \u201CMilk \u0026 honey\u201D vs. the \u201Cmeat\u201D of the gospel \uD83C\uDF6F\uD83E\uDD6900:23:06 \u2013 Who has the authority? \uD83D\uDD1100:27:34 \u2013 The 1886 revelation that sparked the split \u272800:29:04 \u2013 Leroy Johnson: the beloved prophet \uD83D\uDE4F00:32:28 \u2013 Keep Sweet, Pray, and Obey \uD83D\uDD4A\uFE0F00:36:52 \u2013 The split: A Council vs. One-Man rule \u2696\uFE0F00:42:06 \u2013 Apostates, fear \u0026 cutting off ties \uD83D\uDEB700:48:04 \u2013 Growing up \u201Cover the hill\u201D \u26F0\uFE0F00:53:31 \u2013 Why we heard such different stories \uD83D\uDD0D00:59:38 \u2013 Alma Timpson\u2019s fiery sermons \uD83D\uDD2501:03:12 \u2013 Modern leaders: fear \u0026 damnation \uD83D\uDE2101:06:00 \u2013 Why we would\u2019ve feared talking \uD83D\uDE2801:07:58 \u2013 Warren Jeffs takes control \uD83C\uDFDA\uFE0F01:09:47 \u2013 Sons of Perdition \u0026 eternal hell \uD83D\uDD25\uD83D\uDE0801:12:26 \u2013 Leaving: trusting my own path \uD83C\uDFC3\u200D\u2642\uFE0F01:15:24 \u2013 Evil spirits \u0026 dedicated buildings \uD83D\uDC7B01:18:49 \u2013 Realizing how similar we really were \uD83E\uDD1D01:20:22 \u2013 Why we never met until YouTube \uD83C\uDFA501:25:01 \u2013 Sam hasn\u2019t seen his mom in 16 years! \uD83D\uDC9401:28:54 \u2013 Meeting outsiders ruined us, in the best way \uD83D\uDE0001:32:02 \u2013 Living life from the inside-out \uD83C\uDF3101:33:09 \u2013 The first taste of freedom \uD83D\uDD4A\uFE0F01:38:00 \u2013 From missions to deconstruction \uD83C\uDF0D01:40:05 \u2013 \u201CI don\u2019t know\u201D \u272801:42:39 \u2013 Curiosity vs. certainty \uD83E\uDDE001:44:03 \u2013 Final reflections: life, freedom, curiosity \uD83C\uDF0E",

I\u2019m sitting down with my friend Spencer to untangle the often confusing world of Mormonism. Spencer grew up LDS (think: standard-issue Mormons), while I was raised FLDS (but not the Warren Jeffs one\u2014seriously, calm down. Yes there are more than one. See, told you it was confusing).We\u2019ll swap stories, compare notes, and probably realize we both had some pretty epic times singing Mormon songs. It\u2019s part awkward, part eye-opening, and surprisingly funny. Join us as we laugh through the cringe, clear up some misconceptions, and maybe even learn a thing or two\u2026 or at least make you grateful for your own childhood.Follow me on Instagram!@calvinwaymanWATCH MY FILM: HEARTS UNKNOWNhttps://youtu.be/DHkY6SUNFls",

If I would have told my 15-year old self that I would be sitting down talking with someone you can search on p*rnhub, he would have either felt like he was in heaven, or he was definitely on his way to hell. And that\u2019s the conundrum on this episode. Is pleasure inherently good or bad? Why is it so difficult to talk about? Laura Desiree, who was a long-time anchor at Naked News, is a burlesque dancer, sex-positivity advocate, and just all around a curious cat. This is one of my favorite conversations I\u2019ve had to date since moving to New York City. Laura and I just get candid and have real conversation about something we all are either engaged in, thinking about, or at the very least are the product of (and yet! It\u2019s still a shameful thing to discuss in many circles). Through episodes like this one, I hope to spark more conversations around things we are taught to keep silent, because having the freedom to discuss them can have a major impact on all of our lives.
