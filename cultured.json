      "description": "BECOME MY FAVORITE!The boats have been burned! I\u0027ve dedicated my life to storytelling and serving an audience I love--reminding us about the best parts that make us human. If you dig what I\u0027m doing here and want to help spread the mission to expand what\u0027s possible, support here: PayPal.me/calvinwayman. You rock! Now let\u0027s get into today\u0027s episode!-How does someone go from hustling at dead-end jobs to performing in one of the biggest Broadway shows ever?In this episode, I\u0027m sitting down with \u0022Elder McKinley\u0022 of the hit show on Broadway...the Book of Mormon. He also goes by PJ Adzima, in the real world. This is hands down my favorite episode so far on [Cult]ured Boy. It\u0027s relevant \u0022as fck.\u0022 It\u0027s real. It\u0027s raw. AND...incredibly useful.I\u0027d love to hear your thoughts in the comments! I\u0027ll be reading every one (except of course if for some reason the YouTube algorithm blows it up and this somehow gets thousands and thousands of views and then thousands of comments that make it hard to keep up--but no matter what, I promise to give my bestest effort, no matter the number of comments, to interact with everyone)This is gonna sound cheesy but I mean it: I love you guys. This show is my baby, thank you for trusting me with a slice of your day, I don\u0027t take it for granted. I want to continue to bring you the most entertaining, relevant, useful, and still COMPLETELY HUMAN conversations in all of culture. The reason this is my favorite so far is I feel like it stacks multiple of those layers all at once.PS: If you\u0027re a YouTuber and you want to collab, hit me up! If you\u0027re hosting an event and you need a speaker who is a \u0022Bubble Expert,\u0022 I\u0027m your guy. I can help your company behave more \u0022AI-proof\u0022 by breaking out of cult-y thinking. (May also be helpful for attendance to mention the \u0022ex-cult\u0022 or \u002244 siblings\u0022 thing)PS#2: If you know anyone at CNN (or whoever owns Anthony Bourdain\u0027s show \u0022Parts Unknown,\u0022 I\u0027d love to have a conversation with someone about collaborating with my show \u0022Hearts Unknown\u0022--getting deeper into the human stories around culture, and paying homage to the guy who did it best: Anthony Bourdain. RIP .Ultimately, thank you for being here. It means the world. Be well! -Calvin.

I\u2019m sitting down with my friend Spencer to untangle the often confusing world of Mormonism. Spencer grew up LDS (think: standard-issue Mormons), while I was raised FLDS (but not the Warren Jeffs one\u2014seriously, calm down. Yes there are more than one. See, told you it was confusing).We\u2019ll swap stories, compare notes, and probably realize we both had some pretty epic times singing Mormon songs. It\u2019s part awkward, part eye-opening, and surprisingly funny. Join us as we laugh through the cringe, clear up some misconceptions, and maybe even learn a thing or two\u2026 or at least make you grateful for your own childhood.Follow me on Instagram!@calvinwaymanWATCH MY FILM: HEARTS UNKNOWNhttps://youtu.be/DHkY6SUNFls",

SHOW-NOTES About Amanda Rae: Amanda Rae was in the show \u201CEscaping Polygamy.\u201D She has a YouTube channel where she exposes the teachings of the cult she was born into. You can catch her full story by going here: About Calvin Wayman: Hey I\u2019m Calvin. I grew up in a Fundamentalist Mormon cult that practices polygamy, known as \u201CThe Work of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\u201D I have 1 dad, 4 moms, and 44 siblings. Yup. That\u2019s not a typo\u2014forty plus four. All in one house. At 30 years old, I made the most difficult decision of my life and faced hell fire and damnation (according to my religious upbringing) by choosing to leave my religion, and start a whole new life on my own. The last few years have been me getting my feet under me, and today I live in New York City. This show is my expression. My perspectives. My art. I hope to bring awareness to cults, but more importantly, to the underrated power of individual sovereignty. Above all, this is a podcast that celebrates curiosity over conclusion. I hope you enjoy.",

      "description": "Oh my oh my. What an episode. If I would have told my 15-year old self that I would be sitting down talking with someone you can search on p*rnhub, he would have either felt like he was in heaven, or he was definitely on his way to hell. And that\u2019s the conundrum on this episode. Is pleasure inherently good or bad? Why is it so difficult to talk about? Laura Desiree, who was a long-time anchor at Naked News, is a burlesque dancer, sex-positivity advocate, and just all around a curious cat. This is one of my favorite conversations I\u2019ve had to date since moving to New York City. Laura and I just get candid and have real conversation about something we all are either engaged in, thinking about, or at the very least are the product of (and yet! It\u2019s still a shameful thing to discuss in many circles). Through episodes like this one, I hope to spark more conversations around things we are taught to keep silent, because having the freedom to discuss them can have a major impact on all of our lives. Please subscribe to the channel if you haven\u2019t already! It helps the algorithm know to share this with more audience, and gets me one step closer to content-creation being my full-time thing. Thank you for watching, listening and your all-around support.
