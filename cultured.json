Laura Desiree, who was a long-time anchor at Naked News, is a burlesque dancer, sex-positivity advocate, and just all around a curious cat. This is one of my favorite conversations I\u2019ve had to date since moving to New York City. Laura and I just get candid and have real conversation about something we all are either engaged in, thinking about, or at the very least are the product of (and yet! It\u2019s still a shameful thing to discuss in many circles). Through episodes like this one, I hope to spark more conversations around things we are taught to keep silent, because having the freedom to discuss them can have a major impact on all of our lives. Please subscribe to the channel if you haven\u2019t already! It helps the algorithm know to share this with more audience, and gets me one step closer to content-creation being my full-time thing. Thank you for watching, listening and your all-around support. I hope you enjoy this episode. - Calvin Wayman Laura\u2019s Red Umbrella Talk: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZMA-fZofRcXfFdIq4EfN9fK9WF73TOcv To catch Calvin\u0027s full story of growing up in a cult, go here: https://open.spotify.com/episode/1B1s5SL3PKGVg1YSRXoEW4?si=e294bea8deee41f0 TIMESTAMPS 00:00:00 Intro and Teaser 00:01:16 Calvin met Laura where?! 00:03:45 What Calvin felt going to a s*x club 00:04:28 The taboo nature of s*x 00:06:36 What monogamists can learn from people in the s*x lifestyle 00:08:35 How silence around s*xual needs breeds resentment 00:09:31 Calvin\u0027s unpopular take in relationships 00:11:15 The importance of taking care of your s*xual needs 00:13:04 One of Calvin\u0027s favorite things from s*x-positive spaces 00:15:56 How did Laura become Laura? 00:18:01 Laura breaking her \u0022twinship\u0022 identity 00:23:49 How Laura began making her own life 00:25:21 Finding authenticity through the journey of s*xual-discovery 00:26:39 Orgasms 00:28:30 The art of \u201Cletting go\u201D \u0026 Calvin notices a paradox 00:30:52 Bettie Page 00:32:40 Communicating your needs to another human 00:33:54 A sexy hack Laura learned at the \u0022New York School of Burlesque\u0022 00:36:00 What got Laura into s*x work? 00:38:51 The benefits of doing what scares you (like getting naked in front of strangers) 00:42:07 How Laura got into Naked News 00:42:40 Siri (or the Illuminati) joins the conversation 00:44:21 \u0022Dirty talk\u0022 00:46:04 When is it \u0022taking it too far?\u0022 00:50:51 The stigma with s*xual freedom and s*x work 00:55:45 Self-pleasure as a \u201Csin\u201D 00:58:37 Realizing that s*x is okay 00:59:41 Ending on the deep end: What Laura is most proud of from her teenaged-self 01:02:08 Laura reflects gives \u201Cunorthodox answer\u201D to what she\u2019s most proud of from her 20\u2019s 01:03:56 Laura\u0027s first one-night stand 01:06:44 Calvin\u2019s first one-night stand 01:09:17 Laura\u0027s favorite thing about life 01:11:53 Calvin says something that 99% of people wouldn\u0027t 01:13:32 Laura gives everyone a s*xual dare 01:16:47 Follow Laura\u0027s socials! 01:17:28 Final thoughts - please subscribe!",
