      "title": "Episode 4: Warren Jeffs Exposed: Crimes, Control, and the FLDS Church",
      "description": "Behind the peaceful look of a small religious community, a dark truth is hidden. Warren Jeffs, once the leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS), turned a religious group into a frightening cult. He encouraged multiple marriages and taught children strict beliefs. Many people suffered because of him. He made young boys leave their families so older men could marry younger women. Jeffs had total control and frightened everyone. He was eventually caught by the police and put on trial. Evidence showed he did terrible things, like abusing young girls, which he wrongly called \u0022heavenly sessions.\u0022 Listen in as we uncover the shocking details, psychological analysis, and the pursuit of justice that continues to this day.
