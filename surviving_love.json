      "description": "The late 60\u2019s and early 70\u2019s was a time for free love, peace and change. People sought out religious communities and like minded individuals to share in these experiences. The Children of God became a worldwide phenomenon. With a foundation based on Christianity, the sermons quickly shifted to an extreme. One of their biggest \u201Cselling features\u201D of the group was that they cherished and loved the children as God would. But David Berg\u2019s definition of love was much different. As abuse intensified, leadership demands were harder and harder to meet. Self preservation was the only thing that mattered. And now they are Surviving Love.
