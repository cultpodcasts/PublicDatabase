      "description": "Retired agent Ken Lanning served in the FBI for more than 30 years. For twenty years of his Bureau career, he was assigned to the Behavioral Science Unit (BSU) as a profiler specializing in the study of the sexual victimization of children. In this episode of FBI Retired Case File Review, Ken reviews the controversial topics of satanic ritual child abuse, recovered repressed memory, and the suggestibility of children. His work in this area and the ramifications of confirmation bias has divided and polarized many child advocates, the media, and the American public.\r\n\r\n His professional study of the criminal aspects of deviant sexual behavior included assignments to the Missing and Exploited Children\u2019s Task Force from 1996 to 1998 and the National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime from 1998 to 2000. He is a founding member of the Board of Directors of the American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children (APSAC) and a former member of the APSAC Advisory Board and the Advisory Board of the Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers (ATSA).\r\n\r\n He has testified before the U.S. Attorney General\u2019s Task Force on Family Violence, the President\u2019s Task Force on Victims of Crime, and the U.S. Attorney General\u2019s Commission on Pornography. He has also testified on seven occasions before the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives and many times as an expert witness in state and Federal court. Ken Lanning has consulted on thousands of cases involving deviant sexual behavior, the sexual victimization of children, missing and exploited children, and the use of computers and the Internet to facilitate the sexual exploitation of children. He has also been retained as an expert in numerous civil cases concerning alleged negligence by youth-serving organizations.\r\n\r\n Ken Lanning has published articles in the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin and other professional journals. He has authored two monographs on child abuse that have been widely distributed by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). Ken Lanning is the 2009 recipient of the Outstanding Service Award for Lifetime Achievements from the National Children\u0027s Advocacy Center. He has lectured before and trained tens of thousands of law enforcement officers, prosecutors, social workers, mental health and medical personnel, judges, and other professionals on the sexual victimization of children, child abuse and neglect, satanic ritual child abuse, and missing and exploited children. Mr. Lanning is currently a consultant in the area of crimes against children and the author of Love, Bombs, and Molesters: An FBI Agent\u0027s Journey, the story of his life leading up to his assignment to the BSU and his research involving the sexual victimization of children, satanic ritual child abuse, and confirmation bias.\n\r\nCheck out episode show notes, photos, and related articles here:  \nhttps://jerriwilliams.com/ken-lanning-satanic-ritual-child-abuse-confirmation-bias/\n\n  \nJoin my Reader Team to get the FBI Reading Resource - Books about the FBI, written by FBI agents, the 20 clich\u00E9s about the FBI Reality Checklist, and keep up to date on the FBI in books, TV, and movies via my monthly email.
