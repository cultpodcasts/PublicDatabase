We\u2019ll revisit Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh as a boy and look at the life-or-death events that may have turned him into the brash guru. Then we\u2019ll sidle up to some of his earliest Western followers to see why they fell under Bhagwan\u0027s spell. We\u2019ll end the episode at his ashram in Poona and learn about the not-quite-legal methods that some desperate sannyasins used to earn enough money to stay close to their Master.",

We\u0027ll also examine the efforts to find a new home for the ashram, led by two very different but equally devoted women: Ma Yoga Laxmi, and her assistant, Ma Anand Sheela. To the surprise of nearly everyone, Sheela was about to take Bhagwan\u2019s future into her own hands \u2026 forever changing his life and his legacy.",

      "description": "Today we\u0027ll take a grand tour of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh\u2019s first ashram in the city of Poona, India. Within a couple years of its founding in 1974, it had expanded into one of the most popular \u2014 and controversial \u2014 ashrams in India, where people could meditate, commune with likeminded people, and be close to the man they called Master. We\u0027ll see how an unstoppable force of nature made it all happen: Bhagwan\u2019s personal secretary, Ma Yoga Laxmi. We\u2019ll stroll the grounds through the eyes of a newcomer to see what this place was all about. And we\u2019ll explore about a new, lucrative, sometimes-terrifying method that Bhagwan developed to instruct his followers \u2014 and to keep them there.",
