      "title": "How a 2003 article accidentally fueled the rise of NXIVM and Keith Raniere",
      "description": "One minor mystery in the NXIVM story appealed to my interest in collecting old magazines: Why could I not find a copy of the now-infamous 2003 Forbes magazine that ran a cover story profile on Keith Raniere?\n\nIn my attempt to dig into the rumors and the subsequent press coverage, I ended up finding out about why this article, the first major press for NXIVM, was so important. I discovered a lot about the heiresses, Clare and Sara Bronfman, who bankrolled NXIVM. It turned out that the Forbes article resulted in Clare and Sara cutting their father Edgar out of their lives.\n\nThis 2003 profile ended up affecting the entire path of Keith Raniere and NXIVM, but not in the way you probably expect.\n\nSources / links for further reading:\n\nArchived link to the 2003 Forbes profile of Keith Raniere: https://www.archivebuttons.com/articles?article=https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2019/05/15/keith-raniere-the-leader-of-the-nxivm-sex-cult/\n\nArchived link to 2010 Vanity Fair article on Clare and Sara Bronfman and NXIVM: https://www.archivebuttons.com/articles?article=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2010/11/bronfman-201011?srsltid=AfmBOoqbX5UHxb0zO6gcGPtx_TaiB0OVk0KaiVZPyD-cOFSxaGI1O-bN\n\n2010 Observer article on Clare and Sara: https://observer.com/2010/08/poor-little-rich-girls-the-ballad-of-sara-and-clare-bronfman/\n\n2019 New York Times piece on how Clare used spyware to surveil her father Edgar after the Forbes article where Edgar said NXIVM was a cult:\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/nyregion/nxivm-trial-sex-cult-spyware-bronfman.html\n\n2019 Poynter article that chronicles the efforts of local journalists, like at the Albany Times Union, to cover NXIVM: https://www.poynter.org/the-sex-cult-next-door/\n\nReddit thread I posted with a scan of the Raniere profile from a physical copy of the magazine: https://www.reddit.com/r/theNXIVMcase/comments/1p64oxg/scan_of_physical_copy_of_october_2003_forbes/\n\nReddit thread on the importance of the Forbes article with information on the two cover variants and lots of other good follow-up material: https://www.reddit.com/r/theNXIVMcase/comments/1p70pue/why_the_forbes_cover_matters_and_how_the_vanity/\n\n2020 Frank Report article I wrote on disappearance of Kristin Snyder: https://frankreport.com/2020/12/28/the-curious-case-of-kristin-snyder-an-outsider-delves-into-the-rabbit-hole-of-a-womans-disappearance/",
