      "title": "S5E55 | Dalila Sadok - Mother Whistleblows Cult Kidnapping \u0026 Satanic Ritual Abuse of Her Children",
      "description": "Today I\u2019m honored to have on the show and introduce you all to: French whistleblower, survivor advocate, and fierce mother and mama bear who is in the fight of her life to save her two children who were kidnapped and abducted by their father, authorities, and the satanic cult he belongs to: Dalila Sadock\n\nIn a world shrouded by shadows, one courageous mother emerges as a beacon of hope, shattering the silence with her unwavering resolve. Dalila, a lioness of love, steps onto the stage of this transformative podcast, her voice echoing from the heart of France to unveil a chilling tale of betrayal and resilience. She fearlessly exposes a sinister reality: her beloved children, Camile and Milo, were torn from her arms, abducted by their own father with the complicity of a corrupt system - police and authorities entwined in a web of deceit.\n\nOnce a devoted girlfriend, Dalila\u2019s life seemed a fairy tale when she met her ex-boyfriend online, a man she believed was her soulmate. Their romance blossomed swiftly, leading them to build a life together and welcome their first child within a year. Yet, beneath the surface of this dream, a nightmare brewed. It was only after the birth of their second child that Dalila\u2019s intuition screamed louder than the reassurances of doctors who dismissed her daughter\u2019s haunting signs of sexual abuse as mere imagination. Undeterred by their denials, she fought for the truth, eventually escaping her husband\u2019s grip and securing full custody of her children through the courts - a victory for a mother\u2019s fierce love.\n\nBut the battle was far from over. Even with limited visitation rights, her ex\u2019s shadow loomed darkly. Unable to contact her children during his time with them, Dalila\u2019s heart broke as she witnessed their return - shaken, screaming, and scarred by unspeakable trauma. What unfolded next was a mother\u2019s relentless quest for justice. Her children whispered of horrors unimaginable: caged children, graphic accounts of abuse, sketches depicting human sacrifice amid famous French landmarks, presided over by prominent politicians. These were not mere childish tales but cries for rescue, painted in the innocence of their terror.\n\nWith no agenda but to shield her little ones - already in her care full-time by law - Dalila turned to the authorities, armed with her children\u2019s drawings and testimonies. Yet, in a cruel twist of fate, her pleas were met with betrayal. One fateful day, as her children sat in school, the very system meant to protect them facilitated their abduction. Stripped of her rights, accused of fabricating their suffering, Dalila watched helplessly as custody was handed to their abuser. Since that devastating moment, she has not laid eyes on Camile and Milo, her every attempt to reclaim them met with indifference - even surviving assassination attempts dismissed by those sworn to uphold justice.\n\nBut Dalila is no ordinary soul; she is a warrior forged in the fires of adversity. Refusing to be silenced, she has taken her story to the global stage, gracing international podcasts with a mission to ignite a movement. The voice of a fierce mama bear, a desperate hope that the world\u2019s ears will turn toward her children\u2019s plight, exposing the corrupt underbelly of France\u2019s justice system. Camile and Milo are blessed beyond measure to have a mother whose love defies oppression, a mother who transforms pain into power.\n\nToday, you will bear witness to a testimony that pierces the heart - a parent\u2019s darkest nightmare laid bare. Yet, Dalila\u2019s story is not hers alone. This podcast has unveiled a chilling pattern, parents from across borders bound by a shared saga of state-sanctioned theft, their children delivered into the hands of tormentors. It is heroes like Dalila who will dismantle this fractured system, brick by brick, until every child is liberated from the chains of abuse and restored to the embrace of love.\n\nTo call Dalila a fighter is an understatement - she is a force of nature, a living testament to the unbreakable bond between a mother and her children. It is a profound privilege to amplify her story, a miracle that demands your undivided attention. Listen closely, share boldly, and join the chorus of voices rising to reunite Camile and Milo with the fearless woman who will stop at nothing to save them. Together, we can turn her courage into a tidal wave of change.\n\nCONNECT WITH THE IMAGINATION:\nEMAIL: imagineabetterworld2020@gmail.com OR standbysurvivors@protonmail.com\nMy Substack: https://emmakatherine.substack.com/\nBUY ME A COFFEE: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/theimagination\nAll links: https://direct.me/theimaginationpodcast",

      "description": "Today I\u2019m honored to have back on the show once again for another incredible episode: Human trafficking, satanic ritual abuse and Jesuit mind control survivor and whistleblower, published writer and author, mother, educator, blogger, and one of our most beloved and requested guests, Svali!\n\nA short overview about Svali in case you\u2019re new here or have missed any of Svali\u2019s episodes on this podcast - Svali has been a voice for survivors for years now through her blogs \u2018Svali Speaks\u2019 and \u2018Svali Speaks Again\u2019, and the books she has authored including, \u201CBreaking Free of Cult Programming\u201D - which has help lay the foundations for what we know today about cults, trauma-based mind control, deprogramming, secret societies including the Jesuit order, the history of the Illuminati and so much more, as well her brand new 3-part testimony series, \u201CNever Give Up\u201D, which gives a first time deep dive into Svali\u2019s own testimony and life. Born and raised in a cult and having experienced horrors beyond comprehension, Svali broke free of her cult group several years ago and has been on a quest to share the knowledge that she has learned from personal experience to help set others free. There are years of eye-opening information on her blogs, and her books give a very concise and no-nonsense look at the underworld of mind control and the underlying mechanisms to which it is orchestrated, used generationally, and hidden from society.\n\nSvali has graced our show multiple times, each appearance more enlightening than the last, from her powerful two-part testimony series to deep explorations of cult programming, deprogramming, and healing. Today, we celebrate an extraordinary milestone - the release of the third and final installment of her testimony memoir on Amazon, \u201CNever Give Up Part 3: Getting Free\u201D. This book series not only unveils untold stories from her life but also offers profound lessons in resilience, hope, and the miraculous journey of healing.\n\nIn today\u2019s episode, we\u0027ll delve into some critical topics like Immortals and Delta programming, specifically how these are used in the Jesuit Order for memory and skills storage. We\u0027ll also explore the pathways to healing and recovery, offering support to survivors and those who assist them. A reminder that Svali\u0027s insights are drawn from her own personal experiences within the Jesuit Order and they highlight one aspect of mind control but are not universal to all cult groups and practices.\n\nAnd also a quick Trigger Warning to survivors as we will be discussing sensitive subjects related to mind control programming, parts, and systems. Please proceed with care.\n\nSvali brings to us decades of dedicated work in understanding and recovering from the control mechanisms she once endured. This conversation promises to be a beacon of hope and knowledge for anyone seeking truth and freedom from the shadows of manipulation and mind control. I encourage you all to put away any distractions and give your full attention to Svali as this episode is not just an interview, but a life-changing lesson from someone who has courageously fought to bring light to the darkest corners of human experience.\n\nSvali stands before us today as a testament to what the human spirit can overcome. Her journey from the depths of cult control to liberation is nothing short of miraculous, and we are truly honored and blessed to have her share her wisdom with us today once again.

      "description": "What an incredible honor to get to have NXIVM and human trafficking survivor, author, executive producer and an all around inspirational sweetheart, India Oxenberg, join us on this week\u0027s podcast episode! India was a personal inspiration for the creation of our ongoing \u0027Survivor Series\u0027 as her story is one of just a few to break national and international headlines. It\u0027s not often a survivor has their voice or story heard by the public and this episode was very timely with India\u0027s new book release for \u0027Still Learning\u0027 (on Audible) and with recent news breaking regarding the sentencing of NXIVM\u0027s Allison Mack (3 years) and Keith Raniere (120 years).\n\nYou can hear India\u0027s incredible survivor story in full on the incredible docuseries she executive produced on STARZ called \u0027Seduced\u0027, and we used our time together to dive into some aspects of being a survivor that aren\u0027t as commonly talked about such as grooming, cults, mind control, healing, relationships, her inspiration for going public with her story, and the importance of self care. The reality is that a survivor is never \u0027free\u0027 from what they go through and no one is better at humanizing a survivor\u0027s experiences of abuse than India.\n\nThis conversation brings light to asking the important question: \u0022What does human trafficking really look like?\u0022 and (as you\u0027ll see), the answer to that question isn\u0027t as linear as one would think.\n\nPlease support India\u0027s new book and check out her series on STARZ - these are valuable tools to learn more on human trafficking and they pave the way for conversations to be had regarding the psychology of both the abuser and the survivor. India is an absolute delight and I know this episode will impact you as much as it did me!\n\nConnect with India:\nInstagram: @IndiaOxenberg\nLinkTree: https://linktr.ee/Indiaox\n\nCONNECT WITH THE IMAGINATION:\nAll links here:\nhttps://direct.me/theimaginationpodcast",
