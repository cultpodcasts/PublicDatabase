      "description": "Today we are honored to be joined by Ali Davis, a cult and childhood torture survivor. Ali grew up under Bill Gothard\u0027s teachings (otherwise known as the fundamentalist Christian cult portrayed in \u2018Shiny Happy People\u2019). Due in large part to Ali\u2019s childhood experiences, she is now in her early 30s and childfree by choice. Ali is passionate about raising awareness of non-war related childhood torture and is the founder and Executive Director of the pretti graffiti foundation \u2014 the first and only nonprofit in the US dedicated to securing humanitarian aid for other survivors.
