      "description": "#BBCEye Investigations and #BBCNewsBrasil uncover the truth behind the rise of wellness influencer and spiritual life coach, Kat Torres, and the international search for her trafficked followers.\n\nClick here to subscribe to our channel \uD83D\uDC49\uD83C\uDFFD https://bbc.in/3VyyriM\n\nFormer Brazilian model, wellness influencer and spiritual life coach Kat Torres was an inspiration and a lifeline to women all over the world. More than a million people on Instagram followed her extraordinary career trajectory from extreme poverty in Brazil, to a European modelling career and a life of luxury in the US.   \n \nBut behind the perfectly curated posts is a story of witchcraft, exploitation and human trafficking - a dark and secretive sorority that led to missing women and sent their families and the FBI on a desperate search to find them.\n \nAfter months of investigations, a team from #BBCEye and https://www.youtube.com/user/BBCBrasil uncover a wellness empire built on half-truths and lies. This film tells the story of her enslaved followers and the heavy price they paid. And for the first time - in a surreal confrontation behind the walls of a Brazilian prison - we hear from the self-proclaimed \u201Cguru\u201D who exerted absolute control.\n\n\uD83C\uDF9E\uFE0F To watch more investigative journalism from our award-winning BBC Eye team check out this documentary playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz_B0PFGIn4fADt3h_U2SOWErIq-xtXPD\n\n\uD83C\uDFA5 Watch this film in Portuguese on the https://www.youtube.com/user/BBCBrasil channel here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9bOqqQHhuQ\n\n00:00 Who is Kat Torres?\n02:59 Kat\u2019s modelling career\n04:53 Leonardo DiCaprio rumours\n06:48 Kat\u2019s Instagram career takes off\n10:23 Kat\u2019s inspirations\n13:50 Glamorous New York life\n15:22 Alleged oligarch boyfriend\n16:51 Ayahuasca ceremony\n18:00 The \u0027spiritual voice\u0027\n22:17 Gathering followers in Texas\n25:10 Witchcraft practices\n30:12 The \u0027spiritual bath\u0027\n35:32 Disturbing social media posts\n36:40 Girls go missing\n40:15 Secret recording of police call\n43:34 Exclusive interview with Kat in prison\n\n----------------\nThis is the official BBC World Service YouTube channel. \nIf you like what we do, you can also find us here:\nInstagram \uD83D\uDC49\uD83C\uDFFD https://www.instagram.com/bbcworldservice\nTwitter \uD83D\uDC49\uD83C\uDFFD https://twitter.com/bbcworldservice\nFacebook \uD83D\uDC49\uD83C\uDFFD https://facebook.com/bbcworldservice\nBBC World Service website \uD83D\uDC49\uD83C\uDFFD https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldserviceradio\n\nThanks for watching and subscribing!\n#BBCWorldService #WorldService #Instagram #KatTorres #Brasil #Brazil #Luxury #Wellness",
