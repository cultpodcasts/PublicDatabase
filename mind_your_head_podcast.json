      "description": "In this episode, Elliott welcomes Joel Mohamed. Joel shares his fascinating story of growing up in a religious cult and the stories that come along with such an experience. From countless church gatherings, speaking in tongues, and being given life-long contracts at the age of 16, Joel knew this life wasn\u2019t for him. He shares his experience of leaving the cult and his incredible journey of reconnecting with his indigenous roots. They discuss the upcoming Australian referendum and their thoughts on what change needs to happen to bring non-ingenious and indigenous people together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrigger Warning: This podcast episode discusses topics related to mental health, including depression, anxiety \u0026 drug addiction.
