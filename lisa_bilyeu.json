      "description": "\u201CIf it was that bad, why didn\u2019t Cassie just leave?\u201D \u2013 Sound familiar? This question gets thrown around all the time online, and honestly, it misses the ENTIRE point about what keeps victims trapped in abusive relationships.\n\nThe reality is: escaping abuse isn\u2019t about simply \u201Cwalking away\u201D\u2014it\u2019s a tangled web of manipulation, control, fear, and trauma that most people never truly see. And if we don\u2019t get real about this NOW, we\u2019re doomed to repeat these cycles with \u201Cthe next Diddy in waiting.\u201D\n\nSo on this episode, my co-host - criminal behavioral analyst, Laura Richards and I break down the myths exposing the secrets abusers use to control, and DEMYSTIFY what actually keeps victims stuck in dangerous relationships.\n\nWe dive DEEP into Dr. Dawn Hughes\u2019 testimony in the Diddy/Cassie trial, the real meaning of \u201Ccoercive control,\u201D and why the law is failing women\u2014right now. (Spoiler: New York, you had ONE JOB!)\n\nYou\u2019ll learn:\n- Why \u201Cjust leaving\u201D doesn\u2019t cut it\u2014and the real reasons victims feel trapped.\n- How abusers like Sean Combs use charm, threats, money, and emotional manipulation to control their partners.\n- What \u201Ctrauma bonding,\u201D love bombing, and gaslighting ACTUALLY look like (hint: it\u2019s not just what you see in the movies).\n- The 11 hidden signs you (or someone you love) might be in a coercive or controlling relationship.\n- How financial, emotional, and even digital control keep women stuck\u2014and what you can do to spot the signs early.\n- Why current laws are NOT protecting women, and what YOU can do to help change that.\n\nBy the end of this episode, you\u2019ll have the knowledge, insight, and tools to spot abusive patterns\u2014whether in your own life or someone else\u2019s. Laura Richards even shares where you can get quizzes, checklists, and expert advice to reclaim your agency and get help NOW!\n\nSo, if you\u2019ve ever wondered, \u201Cam I in a relationship like this?\u201D or if you\u2019re desperate to support someone who is, this episode is your wake-up call and your lifeline. \n\nRemember: You do NOT have to wait for anyone to rescue you.

And HOW can you make sure it doesn\u2019t happen to you again?? \n\nWell homie, the reality is that this type of manipulation happens more often than you might think, 1 on 1 in toxic relationships and sometimes even whole groups of people at a time in a cult. \n\nSo in this episode of Women of Impact, I wanted to get to the bottom of how good, well-intentioned, educated, \u201Cnormal\u201D people like you and me can fall into the trap of a controlling person like a cult leader or narcissistic romantic partner, and literally leave behind their life, family, job, money, friends, belief system, sanity, and everything about themselves for this person. \n\nAnd whether it\u2019s coz of a cult, a toxic partner, or a guy at work that keeps trying to convince you to join this \u201Camazing self-help group\u201D, if you think it \u201Cwon\u2019t happen to you\u201D \u2013 well homie you\u2019re actually that much more likely to become their next target and victim!!!! \n\nAnd that\u2019s why today\u2019s guest is none other than the ultimate cult expert and deprogrammer, Rick Alan Ross. This guy is an aboslute LEGEND when it comes to cults!!\n\nWe go deep into: \n- the type of people who start cults.\n- how cults like NXIVM and Scientology bring people in.\n- what specifically makes a person more vulnerable to saying yes and \u201Cdrinking the Kool-aid\u201D.\n- strategies used by notorious cult leaders to gain control and brainwash people (and you\u2019ll be surprised by what they have in common with your toxic ex!!!).\n- HOW you can actually avoid getting into a cult or toxic relationship in the first place.\n- \u0026 so much more!!!\n\nAnd that\u2019s just in PART 1 of this 2 part episode!\n\nThis episode is truly FILLED with the knowledge you NEED if you want to have any hope of spotting the cult leaders, con men, and toxic boyfriends BEFORE they can rope you, or anyone you love, into their manipulative world and cut you off from the life YOU want to live!!! \n\n\nCHAPTER MARKERS: \n\n\uD83D\uDEA9 [0:00] Warning signs of a cult or abusive relationship \n\uD83E\uDDE0 [8:55] The process of cult indoctrination \n\uD83D\uDE16 [35:39] Notorious cults, their crimes \u0026 the victims\n\u274C [1:02:46] How toxic abusers gain control \n\n\n\uD83D\uDD25 HOT RICK ALAN ROSS QUOTES:\n\n\u0022You have to ask yourself, can I disagree with this person? Can I disagree with the leader of this group? Is there a place for constructive criticism? Am I becoming socially isolated by being in this group? Am I cutting off people that are my family, my friends, particularly if they\u0027ve raised questions about this leader of the group I\u0027m involved with or this partner that I\u0027m now going out with and making an integral part of my life?\u0022\n\n\u0022[Cult leader Keith] Raniere, by working on these people year after year, seminar after seminar, over a period of time, he would, as you say, wear them. He would wear them down and they would change and they would bend and change their thinking, their perception of reality based on what he indoctrinated them to believe.\u0022\n\n\u201CThese were very sophisticated, very well educated people, and yet they succumb to these persuasion techniques.\u0022\n\n\u0022The group makes you feel so broken continuously, but you feel you can\u0027t leave because you\u0027re broken and you need to be fixed, and it\u0027s always your fault. You\u0027re made to feel shame and guilt.\u0022\n\n\u0022In groups that are totalistic and authoritarian, people are led to believe that the group has one solution and that this solution is perfect and that it is right for all people at all times.\u0022\n\n\u0022This is that \u2018us versus them\u2019 mentality that we see in cults, where there\u0027s a sharp line drawn between us, the people that have the truth and the way and everyone else.\u0022\n\n\nFollow Rick Alan Ross:\nWebsite: https://culteducation.com/\nX: https://x.com/RickAlanRoss\nGet \u201CIs This a Cult?\u201D: https://a.co/d/hKoEsRt\n\nFollow Me, Lisa Bilyeu: \nWebsite: https://www.radicalconfidence.com/ \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/lisabilyeu/ \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/lisabilyeu \nX: https://twitter.com/lisabilyeu \n\n\nIf you want to dive deeper into my content, search through every episode, find specific topics I\u0027ve covered, and ask me questions.

And in this episode she is sharing some of the lessons she learned from her own experiences and the knock-on effects those experiences still have on her to this day.\n\nIn this episode, we\u2019re diving into:\n- Societal myths about narcissists that diminish the seriousness of their abuse \n- How shame deeply affects your actions AND the narcissist\u2019s actions \n- The best way to approach someone you think is in a relationship with a narcissist (and how to respond if YOU\u2019RE the one approached!)\n- How to finally move on with the \u201Crecover from the lie\u201D method \n- The self-blame spiral that has you thinking it\u2019s YOUR fault \u0026 why you MUST escape it to take your power BACK from the narcissist!\n- How confusion \u0026 despair wear down your spirit and energy for life\n- The 3 Rs that keep you trapped in the toxic web\n\nSo if you\u2019re ready to finally frikin\u2019 MOVE ON from that toxic person in your life then grab a cuppa and listen close homie, because this episode is here to help you heal from the abuse and put the pieces back together. \n\nOrder your copy of Dr. Ramani\u0027s new book here: https://a.co/d/7qYmF0f\n\nChapter Markers: \n\n\uD83D\uDC94 [00:00] The Last Effects of Narcissistic Abuse \n\u274C [16:22] Why the Narcissist Won\u2019t Change\n\u2764\uFE0F\u200D\uD83E\uDE79 [21:36] Phases of Healing\n\uD83D\uDC81\u200D\u2640\uFE0F [38:54] Expressing Needs, Building Trust, Making Progress\n\uD83D\uDD25 [43:56] Toxic Shame, The Narcissist \u0026 You\n\uD83D\uDEAA [59:37] Despair \u0026 Painful Realities of Leaving the Narcissist\n\uD83D\uDC49 [1:19:28] Bonus Episode: Jenna Kutcher\n\n****Bonus Episode: Change EVERYTHING with Jenna Kutcher****\n\nKeep watching for a BONUS conversation with my homie Jenna Kutcher, who is helping us get to the heart of what so many women are struggling to articulate. She\u2019s talking about how to stop wasting your life feeling stuck, why you need to feel your feelings, and what you need to change to get excited and really look forward to a version of you 5 years from now.\n\n\n\uD83D\uDD25 DR. RAMANI\u2019S FIRE QUOTES:\n\n\u201CAnd so things that I feel like I could do now were simply not possible then. The resources, the knowledge, the information. So when I feel like I want to be hard on myself, I have to recognize that it\u0027s actually a damned miracle that I\u0027m doing all the things I\u0027m doing, given how much doubt is in my mind about everything.\u0022\n\n\u0022Enough people have told me that they have narcissistic mothers to let me know there\u0027s plenty of narcissistic women out there. I\u0027ve worked with enough men who have been through relationships with narcissistic women to know there\u0027s plenty of narcissistic women out there.\u0022\n\n\u0022Narcissism is considered a maladaptive personality because it puts them at odds with other people. So it\u0027s even less likely to change. And more importantly, because the personality won\u0027t change, the behaviors won\u0027t change, and the behaviors are what affect us in relationships.\u0022\n\n\u201CA lot of people often don\u0027t want to tell their friend or family member that [they\u0027re] a little worried about your new relationship because their fear is that they\u0027re going to alienate that friend or family member. They don\u0027t want to lose that relationship. And so most people don\u0027t say anything.\u0022\n\n\u201CPeople will lose 20 years over one night.\u201D\n\nFollow Dr. Ramani:\nWebsite: https://doctor-ramani.com/ \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@DoctorRamani\nOrder \u201CIt\u2019s Not You\u201D: https://a.co/d/7qYmF0f\n\nFollow Jenna Kutcher:\nWebsite: https://jennakutcher.com/\nPodcast: https://jennakutcher.com/home \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jennakutcher/\n\nFollow Me, Lisa Bilyeu: \nWebsite: https://www.radicalconfidence.com/ \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/lisabilyeu/ \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/lisabilyeu \nX: https://twitter.com/lisabilyeu \n\nIf you want to dive deeper into my content, search through every episode, find specific topics I\u0027ve covered, and ask me questions.
