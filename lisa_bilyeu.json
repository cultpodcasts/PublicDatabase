I\u0027m your host, Lisa Bilyeu, and joining me is cult expert Rick Alan Ross. In this episode, we unravel the insidious tactics of love bombing and conditional affection, the manipulation and dependency that cults and abusive relationships foster, and the isolation and indoctrination techniques that rob individuals of their autonomy.

We\u0027ll discuss gender dynamics in narcissistic behaviors, the rise of female cult leaders like Amy Carlson and Elizabeth Claire Prophet, and the complex realities faced by cult members. From high-profile cases like Charles Manson\u2019s manipulation tactics and Leslie Van Houten\u0027s eventual transformation, to the impact of modern social media in cult awareness, Rick offers invaluable insights into how cults recruit even the most intelligent individuals and celebrities. Plus, we explore the critical role of intervention and the journey towards recovery, touching on compelling stories like Elizabeth Smart\u2019s and Patricia Hearst\u0027s abductions and subsequent reprogramming.

      "description": "If you\u0027ve ever been controlled by someone mentally or emotionally, then you know how crushing it is to your confidence, your self-esteem, and your belief in yourself. \n\nYou question HOW this person convinced you to do or say or believe things that you KNOW deep down to your core are not true? WHAT did they do to get you to fall for the lies and change so much, without you even frikin\u2019 realizing it? And HOW can you make sure it doesn\u2019t happen to you again?? \n\nWell homie, the reality is that this type of manipulation happens more often than you might think, 1 on 1 in toxic relationships and sometimes even whole groups of people at a time in a cult. \n\nSo in this episode of Women of Impact, I wanted to get to the bottom of how good, well-intentioned, educated, \u201Cnormal\u201D people like you and me can fall into the trap of a controlling person like a cult leader or narcissistic romantic partner, and literally leave behind their life, family, job, money, friends, belief system, sanity, and everything about themselves for this person. \n\nAnd whether it\u2019s coz of a cult, a toxic partner, or a guy at work that keeps trying to convince you to join this \u201Camazing self-help group\u201D, if you think it \u201Cwon\u2019t happen to you\u201D \u2013 well homie you\u2019re actually that much more likely to become their next target and victim!!!! \n\nAnd that\u2019s why today\u2019s guest is none other than the ultimate cult expert and deprogrammer, Rick Alan Ross. This guy is an aboslute LEGEND when it comes to cults!!\n\nWe go deep into: \n- the type of people who start cults.\n- how cults like NXIVM and Scientology bring people in.\n- what specifically makes a person more vulnerable to saying yes and \u201Cdrinking the Kool-aid\u201D.\n- strategies used by notorious cult leaders to gain control and brainwash people (and you\u2019ll be surprised by what they have in common with your toxic ex!!!).\n- HOW you can actually avoid getting into a cult or toxic relationship in the first place.\n- \u0026 so much more!!!\n\nAnd that\u2019s just in PART 1 of this 2 part episode!\n\nThis episode is truly FILLED with the knowledge you NEED if you want to have any hope of spotting the cult leaders, con men, and toxic boyfriends BEFORE they can rope you, or anyone you love, into their manipulative world and cut you off from the life YOU want to live!!! \n\n\nCHAPTER MARKERS: \n\n\uD83D\uDEA9 [0:00] Warning signs of a cult or abusive relationship \n\uD83E\uDDE0 [8:55] The process of cult indoctrination \n\uD83D\uDE16 [35:39] Notorious cults, their crimes \u0026 the victims\n\u274C [1:02:46] How toxic abusers gain control \n\n\n\uD83D\uDD25 HOT RICK ALAN ROSS QUOTES:\n\n\u0022You have to ask yourself, can I disagree with this person? Can I disagree with the leader of this group? Is there a place for constructive criticism? Am I becoming socially isolated by being in this group? Am I cutting off people that are my family, my friends, particularly if they\u0027ve raised questions about this leader of the group I\u0027m involved with or this partner that I\u0027m now going out with and making an integral part of my life?\u0022\n\n\u0022[Cult leader Keith] Raniere, by working on these people year after year, seminar after seminar, over a period of time, he would, as you say, wear them. He would wear them down and they would change and they would bend and change their thinking, their perception of reality based on what he indoctrinated them to believe.\u0022\n\n\u201CThese were very sophisticated, very well educated people, and yet they succumb to these persuasion techniques.\u0022\n\n\u0022The group makes you feel so broken continuously, but you feel you can\u0027t leave because you\u0027re broken and you need to be fixed, and it\u0027s always your fault. You\u0027re made to feel shame and guilt.\u0022\n\n\u0022In groups that are totalistic and authoritarian, people are led to believe that the group has one solution and that this solution is perfect and that it is right for all people at all times.\u0022\n\n\u0022This is that \u2018us versus them\u2019 mentality that we see in cults, where there\u0027s a sharp line drawn between us, the people that have the truth and the way and everyone else.\u0022\n\n\nFollow Rick Alan Ross:\nWebsite: https://culteducation.com/\nX: https://x.com/RickAlanRoss\nGet \u201CIs This a Cult?\u201D: https://a.co/d/hKoEsRt\n\nFollow Me, Lisa Bilyeu: \nWebsite: https://www.radicalconfidence.com/ \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/lisabilyeu/ \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/lisabilyeu \nX: https://twitter.com/lisabilyeu \n\n\nIf you want to dive deeper into my content, search through every episode, find specific topics I\u0027ve covered, and ask me questions.

She\u2019s talking about how to stop wasting your life feeling stuck, why you need to feel your feelings, and what you need to change to get excited and really look forward to a version of you 5 years from now.\n\n\n\uD83D\uDD25 DR. RAMANI\u2019S FIRE QUOTES:\n\n\u201CAnd so things that I feel like I could do now were simply not possible then. The resources, the knowledge, the information. So when I feel like I want to be hard on myself, I have to recognize that it\u0027s actually a damned miracle that I\u0027m doing all the things I\u0027m doing, given how much doubt is in my mind about everything.\u0022\n\n\u0022Enough people have told me that they have narcissistic mothers to let me know there\u0027s plenty of narcissistic women out there. I\u0027ve worked with enough men who have been through relationships with narcissistic women to know there\u0027s plenty of narcissistic women out there.\u0022\n\n\u0022Narcissism is considered a maladaptive personality because it puts them at odds with other people. So it\u0027s even less likely to change. And more importantly, because the personality won\u0027t change, the behaviors won\u0027t change, and the behaviors are what affect us in relationships.\u0022\n\n\u201CA lot of people often don\u0027t want to tell their friend or family member that [they\u0027re] a little worried about your new relationship because their fear is that they\u0027re going to alienate that friend or family member. They don\u0027t want to lose that relationship. And so most people don\u0027t say anything.\u0022\n\n\u201CPeople will lose 20 years over one night.\u201D\n\nFollow Dr. Ramani:\nWebsite: https://doctor-ramani.com/ \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@DoctorRamani\nOrder \u201CIt\u2019s Not You\u201D: https://a.co/d/7qYmF0f\n\nFollow Jenna Kutcher:\nWebsite: https://jennakutcher.com/\nPodcast: https://jennakutcher.com/home \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jennakutcher/\n\nFollow Me, Lisa Bilyeu: \nWebsite: https://www.radicalconfidence.com/ \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/lisabilyeu/ \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/lisabilyeu \nX: https://twitter.com/lisabilyeu \n\nIf you want to dive deeper into my content, search through every episode, find specific topics I\u0027ve covered, and ask me questions.
