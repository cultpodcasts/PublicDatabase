      "description": "#cults #mentalhealth #askadoctor #psychiatrydoctor #drelliott\n\n\nSome cults have done some horrible things. As a psychiatry doctor, it\u0027s important for me to know what crimes are from mental illness vs. those that are simply from choice. Folie a deux refers to mass shared delusions. Do these violent and bizarre beliefs that come from these cult leaders count as delusions? If group members are therefore psychotic, can they be held responsible for their actions? It\u0027s actually a really difficult question to answer but I\u0027ll try my best to give it a go on this video.",
