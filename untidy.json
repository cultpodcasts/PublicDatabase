      "description": "In this episode of Untidy, Matilda and Hannah speak with Theophila Pratt, a Gloriavale cult survivor, qualified paediatric occupational therapist, author, and fierce advocate for freedom and healing. Theo, formerly known as Honey Faithful, grew up in Gloriavale, an isolated and highly controlled Christian community on the West Coast. At 18, she was cast out after challenging the regime, with nothing but a suitcase, a ticket to Auckland, and little understanding of how the outside world worked. TRIGGER WARNING: This episode includes discussion of religious trauma, psychological abuse, coercive control, childhood neglect, and sexual abuse. While we approach these topics with care and sensitivity, some content may be distressing for listeners. Please take care while listening and prioritise your wellbeing. Theo shares what life inside Gloriavale was really like \u2014 from the oppressive rules that haunted every moment, to the calculated psychological control that deprived people of their individual identities, especially for girls and women. Theo talks about the subtle acts of rebellion that sparked her path to freedom, what it took to start again from scratch, and how she\u2019s now helping others do the same. Theo reflects on trauma, therapy, rage, spirituality, and walking a determined road to self-trust and reclaiming her voice and identity. Her memoir, \u2018Unveiled: A Story of Surviving Gloriavale\u2019 exposes the realities of life inside the cult and offers hope to those seeking freedom from high-control environments.
