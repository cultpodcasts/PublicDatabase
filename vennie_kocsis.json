The young pastor wrote a thesis in which he described taking the job in order to see if Tulane would eventually accept exorcism as a form of treatment for individuals with mental impairments.  It was this young doctor who sent Jane to Sam for this exorcism. \n\nSam Fife led his followers to believe that Tulane itself had called on him, thereby solidifying the belief that he was indeed, a prophet of God.  Jane Miller went on to be one of the few female ministry in Sam Fife\u0027s cults, lived comfortably and seemingly benefited what a critically thinking individual might call a carefully crafted hoax.",

Her life experience compelled her to a career promoting human rights, welfare and personal empowerment.\n\n\u0027I became an author, speaker and coach because I wanted to grow. I wanted to find out what I was capable of, push my limits and help others do the same,\u0027 she explains, \u0027The life you dream about is possible, but you have to be brave and take action. You have to be willing to let go of disempowering beliefs and adopt new ways of thinking. You have to become a whole new person.\u0027 \n\nLilia\u0027s version of \u2018happy\u2019 is dinner with friends, a good book, indie or alternative rock, concerts, sci-fi movies and art galleries. She loves a fridge full of organic food, yoga, travelling and outdoor adventure. \u0027It\u2019s about living a life that makes me say, Wow, I\u2019m lucky,\u0027 she smiles.\n\n\u0022I learned I can\u0027t run from my past anymore.
