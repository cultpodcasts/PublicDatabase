Today, a few years later, that seems to be the case, with cult activity skyrocketing not just in the US, but around the world. Today we look at what\u2019s causing this problem, and what you can do if a friend or loved one goes a little too far down the rabbit hole.\n\nMy previous cults video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mt_Koq9PYLg\n\nWant to support the channel?

In today\u0027s conversation, she tells her story and discusses how the weird times we\u0027re living in are not just fertile ground for cults, but seems to be creating a whole new kind of cult - one with wide-ranging implications for society.
