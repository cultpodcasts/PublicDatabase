      "description": "Is the Bible inspired by God? This is part 1 of a 6 part series. Are its prophecies true and accurate? Because of the Watchtower\u0027s inaccurate interpretation of Bible prophecy, and for other reasons as well, quite a few ex-JW\u0027s seriously doubt the inspiration of the Bible and the accuracy of Bible prophecies. In this video I show Biblically and historically what the Image of Daniel chapter 2 reveals. I also share a few reasons why I believe the Bible is truly inspired by God. This is a simplified overview of Daniel chapter 2.",

      "description": "This video is a \u0022must see\u0022 not only for Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, but for those who believe in the trinity doctrine as well! You will see from the Bible that God is NOT a trinity, that Jesus is not \u0022co-equal\u0022 nor is He \u0022co-eternal\u0022 with the Father. However, He does share an equality with the Father. You will see clear Biblical proof that Jesus is in fact the Divine Son of God, NOT created but begotten.\n\nThis is a vital point which most Christians, whether Catholic or Protestant including Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, Mormons and Seventh Day Adventists misunderstand.",
