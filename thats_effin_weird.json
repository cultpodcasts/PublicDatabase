      "description": "Join us as we explore the mysterious and oft-controversial Modern Mystery School. Learn about the theoretical and spiritual teachings offered, their roots in King Solomon\u0027s 3000 year-old lineage, and their progression through the generations. Hear experiences of former members who claim to have gained spiritual awakening and unlocked their full potential through the school. Discover the accusations of sexual abuse and controlling behavior, and the possible implications of tax evasion and misuse of charities. Are the teachings of the Modern Mystery School truly a key to unlocking a greater understanding of life and accessing an infinite power, or is it yet another cult with a hidden agenda? With the help from Damion, a journalist from Irland, we will go over the Hows and Whys of this cult.
