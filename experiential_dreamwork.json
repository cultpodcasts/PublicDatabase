      "title": "An Everyday Cult with Gerette Buglion",
      "description": "We explore the dynamic of unethical persuasion especially in the context of dreams. Sharing a dream is a vulnerable act. How do we support each other in owning our own dream experiences without unduly influencing each other? Today we talk with Gerette Buglion about her new book, An Everyday Cult. Gerette is passionate about promoting ethical forms of self-discovery.\n\n\n\nWe talk about gentle ways of exploring dreams together and about what red flags to look out for around choosing a practitioner. Gerette shares some of her experiences about how her life was upended through a cult whose spiritual center involved manipulative dream analysis.\n\n\n\nWe talk about Gerette\u2019s current work in the cult survivor movement and her part in the creation of the #Igotout movement in which people who have escaped from cults are encouraged to share their stories. We finish by talking about NXIVM and QAnon and the Unification Church (aka the Moonies).\n\n\n\nGerette hosts a podcast called Everyday Cults, Everyday People. You can also learn more about cults and get help through organizations including the International Cultic Studies Association (https://www.icsahome.com/) . She also hosts a writing class called \u201CWriting to Reckon\u201D (https://www.gerettebuglion.com/writingtoreckon) .\n\n\n\nBio: Gerette Buglion B.A. Elementary Education and Special Education, was born on Long Island NY and migrated north, eventually landing in Vermont. Her work and passions merged in caring for others as an elementary school teacher, special educator, house parent for people with special needs, a hiking guide and business owner. Her greatest accomplishments include parenting two exceptional young adults, marrying an extraordinarily understanding man and escaping from what she calls \u2018an everyday cult\u2019.\n\n\n\nAlso the title of her memoir, An Everyday Cult shows how an innocent quest for meaning was hijacked by a teacher who recognized Gerette\u2019s thirst for spiritual knowledge, awakening insight \u2013 while simultaneously eroding her capacity for critical thinking. In her book, she shows readers how a mind and psyche can be compromised by a controlling leader\u2014using techniques that fly under the radar of human awareness\u2014and implores readers to wake up to these ever-present abuses of power.\n\n\n\nHer current work in Cult Recovery and Education arises from her dedication to helping others navigate and avoid complex power systems found in controlling groups the world over. Gerette has been a regular presenter at the annual conference for ICSA, the International Cultic Studies Association since 2015. Her signature writing course called, \u2018Writing to Reckon\u2019 offers a safe space for cult survivors to share their story through written word. She works as a consultant and educator in cult dynamics for individuals, families and organizations of all kinds and is a founding collaborator of the #iGotOut movement, whose sole mission is to encourage people who have experienced cultic abuse to tell their stories to help steer society towards a new day where abuse of power is not tolerated.\n\n\n\nShe is especially excited to be a guest on The Dream Journal since the cult she was involved with for 18 years used dream analysis as a controlling technique. Her cult recovery process over the last seven years has included creating new and gentler ways of exploring dreams which continue to inform, support and inspire her. Gerette is passionate about promoting ethical forms of self-discovery.\n\n\n\nYou can contact her at her webpages:\n\n\n\nGeretteBuglion.com (http://GeretteBuglion.com) \n\n\n\nIgotout.org (http://Igotout.org) \n\n\n\nAnd you can",

      "title": "Losing a Loved One to a Cult with Gerette Buglion",
      "description": "Have you ever lost a loved one to a controlling group? Whether around religion, self-improvement or politics, such losses can be devastating. Today we have a conversation with author and cult-recovery educator Gerette Buglion about why it is so important to keep open communication with the loved one and to offer our support for them even if we don\u2019t understand what they are getting from that group.\u00A0 Gerette speaks about indoctrination and provides a check list we can use when questioning whether that group (or person) we have been so excited about might be a cult. We take a call from Veronica from Santa Cruz who asks how we can help loved ones get out of cults. She\u00A0shares her story of taking the drastic step of leaving the US for a year to disentangle herself from a cult.\n\n\n\nGerette offers a three week class starting October 18 called Writing to Reckon for Loved Ones in addition to her ongoing Writing to Reckon classes for people who are looking to process time spent in a high control group or relationship (check the image below or Gerette\u2019s IG feed). Gerette closes with a dream about reconciliation and forgiveness around her own cult experience.\n\n\n\nBIO: Gerette Buglion is author of An Everyday Cult, a memoir which shows how her innocent quest for meaning left her open to manipulation by a controlling dream teacher. Gerette\u2019s current work is in Cult Recovery and Education. Her signature writing course called, \u2018Writing to Reckon\u2019 offers a safe space for cult survivors to share their stories.
