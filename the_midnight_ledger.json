      "description": "In this chilling episode of The Midnight Ledger Podcast, we dive deep into the dark and twisted history of three infamous 19th-century obsessions. We start with the unbelievable story of **The Angel Makers of Nagyr\u00E9v**, a group of women who committed mass murder in a small, isolated town. This true crime saga is one of the most disturbing chapters in European history.\n\nWe then transition to the religious fervor of the 1800s, exploring **The Millerites**, a major Doomsday Cult whose prophecy for the end of the world failed, and the chaotic story of **Prophet Matthias** and his disruptive religious movement.\n\nIf you are fascinated by **forgotten true crime, historical cults, or dark history podcasts**, this episode will keep you listening!\n\n\uD83C\uDFA7 Listen to more episodes of The Midnight Ledger for cinematic storytelling and the darkest corners of real history.\n\n\uD83D\uDD14 Subscribe for weekly episodes: @CuriosityChronicles.x\n- Follow on Spotify, Amazon and EchoesandOddities.com\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nChapters:\n00:00 Intro\n01:10 The Angel Makers of Nagyr\u00E9v\n05:56 The Millerites \u0026 The Great Disappointment\n11:09 Prophet Matthias \u0026 The Kingdom of Matthias\n14:28 Closing Reflection\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n#MidnightLedger #EchoesAndOddities #DarkHistory #TrueHistoryPodcast #WeirdHistory #HistoricalCrimes #19thCentury #AngelMakers #Millerites #GreatDisappointment #ProphetMatthias #KingdomOfMatthias #PoisonProphecyPower #HistoryPodcast #BizarreHistory #CinematicStorytelling",
