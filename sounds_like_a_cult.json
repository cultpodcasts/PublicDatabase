Feel undue pressure to \u2018build passive income,\u2019 even if you aren\u2019t entirely sure what that means, or how to do so? Maybe the siren song of \u2018digital assets\u2019 and \u2018financial freedom\u2019 gives you d\u00E9j\u00E0 vu\u2014  haven\u2019t we heard these buzzwords before?

      "description": "There\u2019s a chance you\u2019ve brushed paths with this week\u2019s cult in a West Coast farmers market or while scrolling through #yogainspiration, or as of late, your HBOMax recommended page. Kundalini yoga promises spiritual awakening, cosmic energy, and a path to your highest self. But behind the flowing white turbans and chanting in sat nam, there\u2019s a darker story\u2014one of control, secrecy, and not one but TWO gurus with highly questionable pasts. This week, we\u2019re unraveling the culty underbelly of Kundalini, its infamous founder Yogi Bhajan, and his 20-teens girlbossified equivalent, Katie Griggs. From Instagram livestreams at millennial haven RaMa Studios to the militarized \u00223HO\u0022 organization (Healthy, Happy, Holy\u2014or is it?), we\u2019re asking: When does devotion cross the line into dogma? Strap in for a deep dive with Hayley Phelan ( @hayleyphelan ), journalist behind the article that powered HBO Max\u0027s Breath of Fire docuseries, and spiritual/sexual abuse lawyer Carol Merchasin, as Amanda and Reese discover why so many former followers say this spiritual practice left them anything but zen.

      "description": "If you\u2019ve ever met a kid who could knit a scarf before they could read, you might already be familiar with this week\u0027s \u0022cult.\u0022 With their dreamy, arts-infused approach to education (think: seasonal festivals, storytelling over standardized testing), Waldorf schools promise a ~holistic utopia for young minds~. But behind the fairy tale fa\u00E7ade lurks a past (and present) steeped in, oh y\u0027know, anti-science ideology, claims of clairvoyance, weird \u0022karma\u0022 stuff, problematic hierarchies, and a suspiciously rigid devotion to its 1920s founder, Rudolf Steiner. And that\u0027s just the beginning! This week, Amanda and Reese break down the culty undercurrents of Waldorf Schools with the help of former Waldorf educator Maggie Smith, who was kicked out of the movement and lived to tell the tale. Is Waldorf a harmless hippie haven? Or an expensive lesson on us vs. them dynamics? Tune in as we unravel its hand-spun, naturally dyed, organic threads! Subscribe to Sounds Like A Cult on Youtube !

It reads: Shen Yun, China Before Communism. What even IS this lavish dance show whose advertisements haunt all our towns? Is it a religion? A political party? A theatre troupe? What is their mission? Is the dancing even good? And where does Shen Yun find the budget for all this marketing?? This week, Amanda is joined by special guests Liz and Brace of the TrueAnon podcast ( @trueanonpod ) to break down the culty undercurrents of Shen Yun, the ultra-mysterious, Falun Gong-backed dance company that\u2019s less about \u201Creviving ancient Chinese culture\u201D and more about, oh, say, labor exploitation, emotional abuse, and apocalyptic doomsday beliefs. ALLEGEDLY. Tune in as we pirouette through the cultiest corners of this not-so-harmless night at the theater. \u0026#x1f3ad;\u0026#x1f4b8;\u2728 Subscribe to Sounds Like A Cult on Youtube !

Father Craigo helps us wrap up 2024 with the rest of his brain-tangling life story in the cult that inspired this whole dang pod, Synanon. This week, he\u0027s answering unfiltered listener Qs, sharing the harrowing tale of Synanon\u0027s downfall, and leaving us all with some takeaways for how to stay culty but not too culty in 2025. We simply cannot WAIT for next year, when your shameless cult leader trio Amanda, Chelsea, and Reese return to cover a slew of long-awaited topics, including a certain cult-followed beauty retailer, a book series that\u0027s turned into a full-blown religion, a freakishly ritualistic education system, a \u0022nonprofit\u0022 \u0022performance troupe\u0022 run by a \u0022new religious movement,\u0022 and more!

Indeed, Amanda\u0027s sweetie dad, Craig Montell, returns to the pod after his featurette on last year\u0027s cult of Military Wives episode, for an extra-special end-of-year, two-part deep dive into the cult that he survived and that inspired this entire show: Synanon. Craigo brings his dad charm and cult experience to break down exactly how this well-intentioned drug rehabilitation program spiraled into a full-on \u002770s compound complete with paranoia, hypocrisy, and some very strange hairstyling choices. This \u0022classic cult\u0022 discussion may not be typical SLAC fodder, but the story is actually more relevant than ever. Craig is here not just to divulge his shocking past, but also to scrutinize how Synanon\u2019s same rituals and methods of manipulation are alive and well in today\u0027s society, from our politics to our social media feeds.

Several months ago, Twin Flames survivor Jessi Hersey, whom you might recognize from the \u201CEscaping Twin Flames\u201D doc on Netflix, slid into our DMs and made a very generous and compelling argument as to why Twin Flames needed airtime on Sounds Like A Cult. After all, it\u2019s important to represent the whole LYL, WYB, GTFO cult spectrum! This week, we\u0027re asking the fundamental questions: How did this niche online self-help \u201Ccommunity\u201D turn so destructive so fast, and how are its tenets low-key a threat to us all? Tune in to find out, and make sure to listen to the very end of the episode. We\u2019re making a highly exciting announcement about the next season of SLAC\u2026 let\u2019s just say there might be a couple new \u201Ccult leaders\u201D (ahem, co-hosts) in your future!
