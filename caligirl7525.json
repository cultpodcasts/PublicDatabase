      "description": "*Please read* In this video, I refute the Jehovah\u0027s Witness doctrine that states only 144,000 can be born again. JW\u0027s believe that there are two classes of believers; the heavenly class (anointed class, little flock) who will be resurrected to heaven and the earthly class (the great multitude of Jesus\u0027 other sheep) who will be resurrected to paradise earth.\n\n0:02 - John 3 Reading\n1:28 I failed to mention that in 2007, the Watchtower changed the 1935 doctrine. They now teach that an anointed Christian can fall away and another JW can take their spot. (Watchtower 2007 May 1 pp. 30-31) \n2:47 The two classes - the 144,000 vs the Great Crowd\n3:43 - Quick WT History Recap \n6:35 - The context of John 3\n10:44 - How to approach Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses about this topic\n11:43 - Revelation 7: 4\n20:34 - Revelation 14: -1-3\n22:55 - John 10\n25:49 - Additional Questions\n\n\n Email: allforthekingofglory@gmail.com\nInstagram.com/caligirl7525\n\n#JehovahsWitnesses #Caligirl7525 #JWORG",

      "description": "This conversation took place last May. In the beginning of this video my vest moves in front of my camera so it looks like I was hiding it. My camera was totally visible and I told them I was recording (this is a real touristy spot, so it\u2019s not odd to have a camera out). Is Jesus Christ the First and the Last, the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End?\n Disclaimer: I don\u0027t believe Jesus is the Father. I know my Jehovah\u0027s Witness friends (or those who still think like the JW\u0027s) will eventually come on here and accuse me of being pagan and how Jesus can\u0027t be God because he prayed to the Father. SO, please do yourself a favor and research the Hypostatic Union and how Jesus had two natures, divine and human. https://carm.org/dictionary-hypostatic-union \n\nAlso, the Watchtower mostly describes the Trinity in Modalism terms. Please look at the difference: https://carm.org/what-is-the-trinity \nhttps://carm.org/trinity\n\nWhat does it mean to be the Alpha and Omega? https://www.gotquestions.org/alpha-and-omega.html\n\n\nP.S. They knew I was recording, I told them and my camera was in plain sight. \n*********\nYou can contact me here:\nallforthekingofglory@gmail.com\ninstagram.com/caligirl7525\nhttp://religiouschic.blogspot.com/\n******************************\n\u0022\u0022Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: \u0027I am the first and I am the last, And there is no God besides Me.\u0022 Isaiah 44: 6\n\u0022I am the Alpha and the Omega,\u0022 says the Lord God, \u0022who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.\u0022 Rev 1: 8\n\u0022When I saw Him, I fell at His feet like a dead man.
