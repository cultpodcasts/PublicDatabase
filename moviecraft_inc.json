      "description": "Rio de Janeiro, the favorite of the jet set. Said to be the capitol of Hedonism. A documentary study of modern manifestations of the primitive cults of Brazil circa 1970. The magical cults came to South America with the African slaves, and although the slaves became nominal Catholics, the old ways continued and are flourishing today. Macumba touching the good spirits, and counteracting the evil spirits. Shot principally in Rio de Janeiro, the film documents the beliefs, practices, with a combination of African spiritism, Catholicism, and European spiritism that characterizes this distinctively Brazilian religion. Women dance themselves into hypnotic trance-like states so the spirits may enter them.  A Macumba temple, with services of spiritualism. A man treated with a brain tumor. Scenes of  musical performances, dancing, and possession of mediums by the spirits. Possessed mediums are shown in therapy sessions with clients in these centers. Rare footage of the Cults of Macumba circa 1970. From our Sterling Educational Films library. Transferred from 16mm color film (faded and corrected)",
