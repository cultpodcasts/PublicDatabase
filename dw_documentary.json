      "title": "Leaving a cult behind - Can brainwashing be reversed? | DW Documentary",
      "description": "Breaking free from the clutches of a cult or a cultish religious movement is a long and painful process. So far, it\u2019s one that has largely gone undocumented. Few people talk about the years of struggle -- and relapses - breaking free entails. Five people who have gone through the process talk about their experiences.\n\nThis documentary about leaving cultish religious movements behind illustrates how powerful the conditioning is -- and how deeply dependent it makes its victims. How is it possible to renounce one\u0027s own identity and \u0022reprogram\u201D the brain?\n\nNicolas has been exposed to this influence since birth: his parents are Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses. At the age of 22, he managed to break away from the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses - but he had to cut off contact with his family. \n\nJulie was 31 and Yohann 20 when they both fell into the clutches of the French \u0022Universit\u00E9 de la relation\u201D movement during what purported to be an \u2018internship in the field of personal development\u2019.\n\nDavid and Fran\u00E7ois became \u0022warriors of light\u201D after they trained in kung fu at the Parc de la Villette in Paris -- and stuck with it for 10 years. They describe insidious manipulation and talk about how they were completely sucked into a parallel world.\n\nThe film\u2019s moving accounts of cult dropouts and their long journeys back to a normal life are supplemented by insights into the work of a French police unit specializing in new religious movements.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "title": "Faith, power, manipulation - The secrets of the Opus Dei sect | DW Documentary",
      "description": "For many critics, the arch-conservative Catholic community Opus Dei is a diabolical sect. However, Opus Dei (which translates to \u0022Work of God\u201D) sees itself in a very positive light. Even today, it\u2019s very difficult to look into the inner world of the sect.\n\nThat\u0027s because its 90,000 members worldwide have taken a vow of secrecy - and those who have left report persecution if they break that vow. Meanwhile, Opus Dei is working to become the most influential player in the Catholic Church. To this end, it maintains a secret network - including branches in Germany. \n\nIt is no coincidence that the German headquarters are located in Cologne - Germany\u2018s most powerful Catholic archdiocese. In Germany, Opus Dei is focused on trying to gain a foothold in the field of education, by running daycare centers and schools.\n\nThe examination of a daycare center in Munich shows that Opus Dei deliberately conceals its involvement in these institutions. Another component of the network is IESE, the business school of Opus Dei, which also has an offshoot in Germany. It is considered one of the best schools of its kind in the world.\n\nIn Spain, where Opus Dei originated, sect members are active in parts of the judicial and educational sectors. The documentary tries to uncover these connections in both Spain and Germany, and lets both victims and experts have their say. It also includes an interview with the head of Opus Dei, Christoph Bockamp.\n\nFor the first time, a former member from Germany reports on her ordeal in Opus Dei and the harassment she experienced after she broke away from the sect. Spaniard Carmen Charo developed mental health problems during her time in Opus Dei, due to brainwashing and psychological pressure. Today, she helps others in their journey out of Opus Dei.\n\nDietmar Scharmitzer is trying to do the same thing with German-speaking people who want to leave, and runs an Internet platform to help inform them. Finally, Marco Politi, an author and Vatican expert from Rome, takes stock of the influence Opus Dei has exerted since the time of Pope John Paul II.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.
