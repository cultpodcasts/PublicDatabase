Listen in here or you can watch it on Sobriety Bestie Youtube. Based on my 10 years inside AA, 5 years outside AA, and everything I\u2019ve learned since speaking publicly \u2014 I\u2019m unpacking it all. Inside this episode: \u2728 My first impressions of AA (hint: it wasn\u2019t great) \u2728 Love bombing, mind control, and \u0022friends with conditions\u0022 \u2728 Why informed consent matters in recovery \u2728 How the real whiplash hit AFTER I left \u2728 Why speaking out is met with cult-like behavior \u2728 And how my mind is still evolving on this question today This is about truth. freedom. critical thinking. If you\u2019ve ever wondered: \u2013 \u0022What the hell did I just go through?\u0022 \u2013 \u0022Why does leaving AA feel so intense?\u0022 \u2013 \u0022Am I crazy for questioning it?\u0022 You are not alone. There are thousands of us silently thriving after leaving AA.
