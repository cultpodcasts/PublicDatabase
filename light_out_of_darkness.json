      "description": "At the recent district convention held in the summer of 2016 the WTBTS has released new policy measures concerning shunning. These findings go completely against what Jesus Christ has instructed and Christian ideology as a whole. Pray for those that have yet to come out. Pray for those who feel stuck with no where to go.  Pray that all seek Christ. Thank you for all the continued love and support. God bless you all.\nLINK TO NEW CHANNEL;\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDpGrQzSaz1SnN47Vpkw8yw",
