      "description": "If there\u0027s one thing cult leaders do, it\u0027s talk. A LOT. Language is an integral part of how cults keep their members bonded, isolated and obedient.\n\nOtherwords is a PBS web series on Storied that digs deep into this quintessential human trait of language and finds the fascinating, thought-provoking, and funny stories behind the words and sounds we take for granted. Incorporating the fields of biology, history, cultural studies, literature, and more, linguistics has something for everyone and offers a unique perspective on what it means to be human.\n\nHost: Erica Brozovsky, Ph.D.\nCreator/Director: Andrew Matthews \u0026 Katie Graham\nWriter: Andrew Matthews\nProducer: Katie Graham\nEditor/Animation: Andrew Matthews\nExecutive Producer: Amanda Fox\nFact Checker: Yvonne McGreevy\n\nExecutive in Charge for PBS: Maribel Lopez\nDirector of Programming for PBS: Gabrielle Ewing\nAssistant Director of Programming for PBS: John Campbell\n\nStock Images from Shutterstock\nMusic from APM Music\nOtherwords is a production of Spotzen for PBS Digital Studios.\n\u00A9 2024 PBS.
