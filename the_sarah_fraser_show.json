      "description": "In this episode, I had the opportunity to speak with Natalie Robehmed, the host of \u0022Allison After NXIVM,\u0022 where we explored the complex and troubling journey of Allison Mack, best known for her role on \u0022Smallville.\u0022 We discussed how Allison, initially seeking personal growth, became deeply involved in the NXIVM cult led by Keith Raniere, ultimately leading to her participation in harmful practices. Natalie shared her unique experience of gaining access to Allison after her release from federal prison, revealing a remorseful and introspective side of her that contrasts sharply with the villainous image portrayed in the media.
