      "description": "I had an engaging conversation with Ben Brown, a comedian and TikTok star known for his candid takes on his upbringing in a polygamous family, being a nephew of Kody Brown from the Sister Wives franchise. Ben discussed the challenges of growing up poor in a polygamous household governed by strict beliefs, the complexities of family dynamics, and the misconceptions surrounding polygamy. Plus, does he stay in touch with Kody Brown and his cousins. Ben offers Janelle, Meri, and Christine advice now that they\u2019re free, talks TLC and profiting off children, Garrison\u2019s passing, and more.
