      "description": "Today on Mea Culpa, I welcome back Dr. Steven Hassan, mental health expert, author, and host of the Cults, Culture \u0026 Coercion podcast, for a chilling look at how MAGA operates like a mind control movement. Drawing from his own experience in the Moonies and decades of studying coercive psychology, Hassan explains why Trump\u2019s followers remain loyal despite scandals, how repetition and fear fuel authoritarian obedience, and why MAGA loyalists must be seen as victims of psychological warfare. We dig into the overlap between cult tactics, Christian nationalism, and Trump\u2019s constant attacks on the press, as well as how the ongoing Epstein revelations expose the lengths to which the powerful will go to protect themselves. From Putin\u2019s playbook to Supreme Court rulings, this episode reveals how authoritarian influence spreads and how we can break its grip before it\u2019s too late.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\n\nEthos: Get your FREE quote at https://ethos.com/COHEN\n\nPrize Picks: Visit\u00A0https://prizepicks.onelink.me/LME0/COHEN\u00A0and use code COHEN and get $50 in lineups\u00A0when\u00A0you play your\u00A0first $5 lineup!\n\nSubscribe to Michael\u0027s Substack: https://therealmichaelcohen.substack.com/\nSubscribe to Michael\u0027s YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@TheMichaelCohenShow\nJoin us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliticalBeatdown\nAdd the Mea Culpa podcast feed: https://www.meidastouch.com/tag/mea-culpa-with-michael-cohen\nAdd the Political Beatdown podcast feed: https://www.meidastouch.com/tag/political-beatdown\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "Today on Mea Culpa, I\u2019m joined by Dr. Steven Hassan, mental health expert, founder of the Freedom of Mind Resource Center, and author of several books, including The Cult of Trump. A former cult member turned leading authority on cults and authoritarian control, Dr. Hassan, walks us through how these tactics are being used to manipulate the American public and consolidate Trump\u2019s power. From Supreme Court justices acting as ideological enforcers to mass deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, he explains how psychological warfare, religious extremism, and strategic mind control are shaping the political landscape. Drawing chilling parallels to past authoritarian regimes, this episode sounds the alarm and offers a path to reach those caught in the MAGA movement.
