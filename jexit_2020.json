The state of the world shows us the end is close, and Satan is like a roaring lion, seeking to devour us.\r\n\r\nAli Millar is waiting for Armageddon. Born into the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses in a town in the Scottish Borders, her childhood revolves around regular meetings in the Kingdom Hall, where she is haunted by vivid images of the Second Coming, her mind populated by the bodies that will litter the earth upon Jehovah\u0027s return.\r\n\r\nIn this frightening, cloistered world Ali grows older. As she does, she starts to question the ways of the Witnesses, and their control over the most intimate aspects of her life. As she marries and has a daughter within the religion, she finds herself pulled deeper and deeper into its dark undertow, her mind tormented by one question: is it possible to escape the life you are born into?\r\n\r\nA tale of love and darkness, of faith and absolution, The Last Days is an unforgettable memoir of one woman\u0027s courageous journey to freedom.\u0022\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATED LINKS\r\n\r\nGet the book on Amazon (Hardcover, Audiobook, and Kindle)\r\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Last-Days-memoir-desire-freedom/dp/1529109523\r\n\r\nFollow Ali Millar on Twitter\r\nhttps://twitter.com/ali_l_millar\r\n\r\nFollow Ali Millar on Instagram\r\nhttps://instagram.com/ali_millar_writes\r\n\r\nAli\u0027s website\r\nhttps://www.alimillar.com\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO SUPPORT MY WORK\r\n\r\nBecome a patron:\r\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Jexit_2020\r\n\r\nGet your Jexit merch:\r\nhttps://www.redbubble.com/people/jexit-2020/shop\r\n\r\nOne-time donations:\r\nhttps://paypal.me/jexit2020\r\n\r\n\r\nFOLLOW, CONNECT, CONTACT\r\n\r\nLinks: https://linktr.ee/Jexit_2020\r\nEmail: jexit_2020@outlook.com",

      "description": "It\u0027s Mental Health Awareness Week in the UK (May 10th - 16th 2021) and I thought it would be a great time to speak about the mental health struggles of both current and former Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses and I\u0027ve invited two guests onto the channel to help me do this. Jared Hall I\u0027m joined by Jared Hall, a former Jehovah\u0027s Witness and a counselling and psychotherapy University student. Jared has recently become involved with the SAPUK organisation, which allows people to talk about their experiences with suicide. Jared is very passionate about good mental health and love for people. One thing Jared feels is so important is to speak to yourself internally as you would speak to someone you love, that is the start to self-love. Debbie Edwards I\u0027m also joined by Debbie Edwards, a former Jehovah\u0027s Witness and CP/CAB Certified Counsellor who recently joined the Samaritans to lend counselling support in this peri-post pandemic world. Debbie has been a guest on the channel before where she told her experience of leaving the JW \u0022religion\u0022 and subsequently waking up from her indoctrination. Debbie is very active in the ExJW community and is keen to help use her own experiences and her professional training to help all those who are struggling to overcome their cult experience.
