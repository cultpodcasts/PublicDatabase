Justice is often looked at as an outcome. This is because the media and lawyers focus on Justice for the self serving purposes that apply to their interests. However. Justice is the process and it\u2019s actually what makes our country the greatest on earth. We will be approaching cases from that perspective and looking at the process not the outcome to determine if justice has been served. My father was a renowned criminal defense attorney so I spent my childhood working in his law office and seeing the perspective of a defense attorney. I also got to see the justice system from the perspective of a family member of a criminal defendant as well. I have served on a jury (as foreperson) and have watched court for most of my life. It is through these experiences I bring a unique perspective to criminal cases and will share my thoughts and analysis on this channel!\n\n#justice #trials #crime \n\nYou can contact me at Justiceisaprocess@gmail.com\n\nFeel free to reach out regarding questions about any cases you see.

Justice is often looked at as an outcome. This is because the media and lawyers focus on Justice for the self serving purposes that apply to their interests. However. Justice is the process and it\u2019s actually what makes our country the greatest on earth. We will be approaching cases from that perspective and looking at the process not the outcome to determine if justice has been served. My father was a renowned criminal defense attorney so I spent my childhood working in his law office and seeing the perspective of a defense attorney. I also got to see the justice system from the perspective of a family member of a criminal defendant as well. I have served on a jury (as foreperson) and have watched court for most of my life. It is through these experiences I bring a unique perspective to criminal cases and will share my thoughts and analysis on this channel!\n\n#justice #trials #crime \n\nYou can contact me at Justiceisaprocess@gmail.com\n\nFeel free to reach out regarding questions about any cases you see.
