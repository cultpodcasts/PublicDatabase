      "description": "Back in 1990, I was friends with Keith Raniere who would become the most notorious cult leader of modern times - forming the cult NXIVM. I found this out years after I knew him. Some of the things we shared together also probably influenced his cult.  Who knew?\n\nNOTE: I don\u0027t endorse cults or cult leaders (duh!). Don\u0027t start a cult, don\u0027t be in a cult. Don\u0027t do anything you don\u0027t want to do. This is just my story with Keith Ranaire.\n\nHere are a bunch of links about this case you might find useful. \nTed Talk by a woman who was in NXIVM\nhttps://youtu.be/fa7uN2vo6rc?si=UJnHOw7cCtNKT5u3\n\nNew York Times: Keith getting 120 years:\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/27/nyregion/nxivm-cult-keith-raniere-sentenced.html\n\nPeople Magazine: https://people.com/crime/nxivm-leader-keith-raniere-speaks-out-for-first-time-since-arrest/\n\nKeith talking about the branding process: \nhttps://www.news10.com/news/listen-allison-mack-and-keith-raniere-discuss-nxivm-branding-process/",
