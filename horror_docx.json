      "description": "Dive into the chilling world of online cults as we uncover the disturbing story of the University of Cosmic Intelligence and its self-proclaimed prophet, Rashad Jamal White. This video explores how a seemingly spiritual movement on YouTube and TikTok transformed into a dangerous online cult, leading to tragic real-world consequences. From bizarre conspiracy theories about reptilian overlords, synthetic NBA players, and birds as government drones to shocking incidents like the murder of Helen Nettle Wasam by her son Daman, a devoted follower who spent thousands on cult merchandise, and the fatal ambush orchestrated by members Yasmin Haider and Crystal Pinkins who attempted to rob a couple, discover the profound and often deadly influence of digital deception. We also touch upon the mysterious disappearances of other Cosmic Intelligence members. Understand how the internet amplifies the reach of such groups, making it easier for them to attract and recruit new followers, often targeting vulnerable individuals seeking connection or purpose through social media platforms. This is a cautionary tale about the dark side of online communities and why it\u0027s crucial to discern truth from manipulation. What disturbing things lurk in the online world?",
