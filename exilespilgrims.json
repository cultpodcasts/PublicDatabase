It\u2019s about whether the historical record matches the Watchtower\u2019s narrative.\n\nIn this episode, we look closely at:\n\n\u2192 What Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses mean by the \u201CGreat Apostasy\u201D\n\u2192 How the Governing Body claims early Christianity became corrupted\n\u2192 Whether early Christian writings actually support that claim\n\u2192 The role Constantine is often blamed for \u2014 and what really changed\n\u2192 Why the apostasy narrative is essential to Watchtower authority\n\nWhen an organization claims exclusive truth by asserting that all other Christians were wrong for 1,800 years, the burden of proof matters.\n\nAnd when questioning that narrative is discouraged, it raises a deeper question: Is the Great Apostasy a historical conclusion \u2014 or a theological necessity?\n\nWhether you\u2019re a current Jehovah\u2019s Witness, PIMO, ex-JW, or simply researching early Christianity and Watchtower doctrine, this video will help you examine a claim that almost everything else depends on.\n\n\uD83D\uDD14 Subscribe to @exilesandpilgrims for thoughtful, historical analysis of Jehovah\u2019s Witness beliefs, Watchtower history, and high-control groups \u2014 without fear-mongering or hype.\n\n\u25B6\uFE0F Watch next: Joe Rogan Called Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses a Cult \u2014 Here\u2019s Why That Matters\n\uD83D\uDC49 https://youtu.be/4VBSj6zd1Fw\n\n\uD83D\uDD0D Topics covered\nGreat Apostasy, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, Watchtower, Governing Body, David Splane, early Christianity, Church history, Constantine, Ignatius, Irenaeus, JW doctrine, apostasy, Watchtower teachings, Christian history, ex-Jehovah\u2019s Witness, PIMO, high-control religion, and Watchtower theology",

It\u2019s why the word \u201Ccult\u201D hits such a nerve for Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, and why hearing it from voices like Joe Rogan matters now more than ever.\n\nIn this video, I break down what Joe Rogan actually said, why Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are conditioned to distrust outside criticism, and how the Watchtower\u2019s authority depends on discouraging honest examination.\n\nWhen an organization claims divine guidance but punishes questioning, isolates dissenters, and frames outside voices as dangerous, you have to ask: Is the real problem criticism \u2014 or control?\n\nWatch the full video to learn...\n\u2192 Why Joe Rogan\u2019s comments resonate so strongly with current and former JWs\n\u2192 How the Watchtower conditions members to avoid outside perspectives\n\u2192 Why the word \u201Ccult\u201D triggers fear instead of discussion\n\u2192 And what each of us can do to help more JWs wake up\n\nWhether you\u2019re a current Jehovah\u2019s Witness, PIMO, ex-JW, or simply researching Watchtower beliefs, this video will help connect dots that are rarely examined openly in the JW community.\n\n\uD83D\uDD14 Subscribe to @exilesandpilgrims for clear, thoughtful analysis of Jehovah\u2019s Witness doctrine, Watchtower history, and high-control religion \u2014 without fear-mongering or hype.\n\n\u25B6\uFE0F Watch next: The Founder of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Believed WHAT?!

It\u2019s documented Watchtower history.\n\nWe\u2019ll look at:\n\n\u2192 What Charles Taze Russell actually believed about the Great Pyramid\n\u2192 How pyramid measurements were used to predict biblical timelines\n\u2192 Why early Watchtower publications promoted pyramid prophecy\n\u2192 When and why the organization quietly distanced itself from these ideas\n\u2192 And what this reveals about claims of divine guidance and \u201Cnew light\u201D\n\nIf God chose Charles Taze Russell as his mouthpiece, as he claimed, then it\u0027s fair to ask: What did this man believe?
