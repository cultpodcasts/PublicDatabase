      "description": "In this bonus episode, we unpack the media frenzy surrounding Charlie Kirk\u2019s assassination and how it has been transformed into a potent narrative of martyrdom. We explore how AI technologies have amplified and reshaped this story, casting Kirk as a symbol in a broader battle between good and evil. Through the lens of biblical martyrdom, we examine how this framing mobilizes the Christian right, blurs the line between faith and politics, and becomes a rallying point for the U.S. political class.",
