      "description": "What if the United States wasn\u2019t just influenced by cult-like thinking, but shaped by it from the very beginning? This week on Simplify, Caitlin Schiller speaks with journalist and author Jane Borden, whose book Cults Like Us: Why Doomsday Thinking Drives America explores how cult dynamics show up across U.S. history, politics, consumer culture, and self-help. From Puritan theology to superhero movies, Borden argues that cults aren\u2019t fringe phenomena\u2014they\u2019re extreme versions of patterns baked so deep into American culture that they came over in the metaphorical sourdough starter brought over on the Mayflower. Together, Caitlin and Jane unpack why Americans are so drawn to comfort, certainty, and strongmen\u2014and what it costs us when we give up agency in exchange for reassurance. You\u0027ll also hear about Caitlin\u0027s new least favorite figure in history (spoilers: it\u0027s the compunctionless Edward Bernays), dismantle the stories about power we\u0027re told, learn how the desire for comfort slowly erodes democracy, and where we should turn\u2014if not to a singular outside \u0022hero\u0022\u2014to save the day.
