      "description": "The mental health of the American president is critical to the future of the country\u2013and it\u2019s clear to even a casual observer of Donald Trump that his patterns of speech, inability to state the truth on just about any subject, and the apparent joy he gets out of watching other people suffer\u2013indicate that something strange is going on in the way he perceives the world.Psychiatrists are often reluctant to speculate diagnosing someone in the absence of a face-to-face clinical exam. And yet, it appears that Trump has taken several such exams\u2013including brain scans and mental acuity tests\u2013that he brags about, but never releases reports on. Which is why I have brought Frank George, Ph.D. onto the show today. George holds a PhD in Psychology and Neuroscience from the University of Colorado Boulder, and was formerly the Chief of Behavioral and Biochemical Genetics at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). He\u2019s an expert on narcissistic personality disorder and writes a popular substack that focuses on Trump\u2019s Mental state called \u201CThe Gaslight Report\u201D which I highly recommend you take a look at.Get Early Access on Substackhttps://sgcarney.substack.com/Join this channel to get access to perks:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3PyxGKt94kLzVqkkjEgRFw/join",

      "description": "This is my final report on Wim Hof\u2014the charismatic ice-guru who exposed me to the magic of breathwork and cold exposure. Since I first met Hof in 2013 he has become increasingly erratic and even dangerous. Today a new edition of my New York Times bestselling book What Doesn\u2019t Kill Us is officially for sale and I\u2019d love you to pick up a copy or download the audiobook on Audible. (Incidentally, if you already have a copy from Audible you can just re-download the book to access the new files for free).\n\nI\u2019m setting the record straight about Hof because of the prominent endorsements I gave him over the course of a decade. I still believe in the transformative power of various environmental exposure and breathwork regimens, it\u2019s just that Wim can no longer be the face of the movement. Over the last two years I\u2019ve collected archival footage of Hof, interviewed dozens of people whose family members\u2019 died following Wim\u2019s instructions and endured near-constant abuse from his cult-like devotees who would rather call me \u201CJudas\u201D in the pantheon of Hof than look at the evidence with clear eyes. The video I\u2019m putting out today collects the most important pieces of Hof\u2019s story that ultimately made me change my mind about him.\n\nOfficial Book Page: https://www.scottcarney.com/what-doesnt-kill-us\n\nAudible: https://www.audible.com/pd/B01N5NNZF8/?source_code=AUDFPWS0223189MWT-BK-ACX0-077506\u0026ref=acx_bty_BK_ACX0_077506_rh_us\n\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/What-Doesnt-Kill-Environmental-Conditioning/dp/1635652413/?tag=Foxtopus-20\n\n\nGet Early Access on Substack\nhttps://sgcarney.substack.com/\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3PyxGKt94kLzVqkkjEgRFw/join\n\nPatreon: \nhttps://patreon.com/sgcarney\n\n\n\n\nScott Carney Investigates Podcast\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/podcast\n\nYouTube https://www.youtube.com/@sgcarney\n\n\nBooks:\n\u2060The Wedge\u2060 \nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/the-wedge\n\n\n\u2060What Doesn\u0027t Kill Us\u2060\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/what-doesnt-kill-us\n\n\n\u2060The Enlightenment Trap\u2060\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/the-enlightenment-trap\n\nThe Vortex\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/the-vortex\n\n\nThe Red Market\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/the-red-market\n\n\n\n\n\nListen to the Scott Carney Investigates Podcast on:\n\nYouTube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2TVEkr1lWIJp6zZijbuZE8xTn5Edur-7\n\n\nApple:\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/scott-carney-investigates/id1675685319\n\n\nSpotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/show/5Eez65bpNJSDLCYQb7yck5\n\n\nAnchor:\nhttps://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/12a9Xdpn6yb\n\n\nSocial Media:\n\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@sgcarney\n\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/sgcarney/\n\nFacebook   https://www.facebook.com/scottcarneyauthor\n\nTwitter https://twitter.com/sgcarney\n\nBluesky https://staging.bsky.app/profile/sgcarney.bsky.social\n \n#wimhof #breathwork #cult\n\n\u00A9PokeyBear LLC (2024)",

      "title": "Inside the Insane Doomsday Cult that Tried to Destroy the Planet",
      "description": "In March 1995 members of a doomsday cult released sarin nerve gas on subway lines all across Tokyo killing 13, and injuring more than 1,000 others. Shoko Asahara, the leader of Aum Shinrikyo, taught that an apocalypse would return the world to a pristine state. This end-times ideology eerily mirrored the accelerationist beliefs of the present day technological elites who aim to break down present day economic and social systems to establish a techno-futurist New World Order.\n\nAum Shinrikyo is a cautionary tale of how far independent religious organizations can go to carry out destructive ends. Still, few people know how far the group was really willing to go. Over the course of several years the group raised more than a billion dollars, recruited biological, chemical and nuclear scientists and set them to work developing truly catastrophic plans. They bought a ranch in the Australian outback dedicated to weapons testing. They eventually accumulated thousands of tons of both Sarin and VX. They used the gas in both subway attacks and in targeted murders.\n\nWhile those details are well-known, there is evidence to suggest that Asahara was working on even bigger plans \u2014 ones that seemed to be pulled right out of the pages of science fiction. In the early 1990s Aum Shinrikyo sent emissaries into the former Soviet Union to train their group with discarded military weaponry. Intelligence analysis reported that they also made efforts to acquire several of the hundred suitcase sized nuclear weapons that disappeared after the fall of the Berlin wall. The plan may have been to turn the device into a seismic weapons that would set off a cataclysmic earthquake in Japan which, they believed, would also begin the world down the path of nuclear war.\n\nIn the video above I discuss the evidence, history and science behind tectonic weapons and show how Aum Shinrikyo was probably trying to make one work.\n\nWhile the world ultimately didn\u2019t end, Aum Shinrikyo\u2019s tactics and capabilities need to remain at the front of our mind. The barriers to creating world-ending technologies through gene-editing, autonomous drones, nuclear weaponry and biological agents get lower every year. As more groups adopt extreme ideologies it is easier than ever to find one who might take the next step.\n\n#cult #accelrationism #prophecy #aumshinrikyo\n\nGet Early Access on Substack\nhttps://sgcarney.substack.com/\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3PyxGKt94kLzVqkkjEgRFw/join\n\nPatreon: \nhttps://patreon.com/sgcarney\n\n\n\n\nScott Carney Investigates Podcast\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/podcast\n\nYouTube https://www.youtube.com/@sgcarney\n\n\nBooks:\n\u2060The Wedge\u2060 \nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/the-wedge\n\n\n\u2060What Doesn\u0027t Kill Us\u2060\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/what-doesnt-kill-us\n\n\n\u2060The Enlightenment Trap\u2060\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/the-enlightenment-trap\n\nThe Vortex\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/the-vortex\n\n\nThe Red Market\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/the-red-market\n\n\n\n\n\nListen to the Scott Carney Investigates Podcast on:\n\nYouTube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2TVEkr1lWIJp6zZijbuZE8xTn5Edur-7\n\n\nApple:\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/scott-carney-investigates/id1675685319\n\n\nSpotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/show/5Eez65bpNJSDLCYQb7yck5\n\n\nAnchor:\nhttps://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/12a9Xdpn6yb\n\n\nSocial Media:\n\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@sgcarney\n\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/sgcarney/\n\nFacebook   https://www.facebook.com/scottcarneyauthor\n\nTwitter https://twitter.com/sgcarney\n\nBluesky https://staging.bsky.app/profile/sgcarney.bsky.social\n \n\u00A9PokeyBear LLC (2024)",

      "title": "How a 1944 Supreme Court Case Legalized Religious Scams, Wellness Grifts, and Pyramid Schemes",
      "description": "Why does the American legal system protect scammers? \n\nIn 1944, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down a decision that laid the foundation for religious scammers to raise unfathomable fortunes through fraud.  The ruling effectively gave religious leaders the legal right to sell miracle cures, supernatural services, and snake oil remedies under the protective umbrella of \u0022sincerely held beliefs.\u0022\n\nFast forward 80 years, and that same legal precedent has helped fuel a booming industry of wellness influencers, spiritual gurus, and multi-level marketing schemes. Today, they crowd our social media feeds, promising divine transformations and quantum healing\u2014if only you\u2019ll click \u201Csubscribe.\u201D\n\nBut how did we get here?\n\nLet\u2019s rewind to the 1930s. Guy and Edna Ballard founded a spiritual movement known as the I AM Activity, a cult-like group that claimed contact with \u201CAscended Masters\u201D\u2014mythical beings said to congregate inside Mt. Shasta. The Ballards preached that you could heal anything, even incurable diseases, through the power of positive thinking and divine energy.\n\nTheir product lineup included things like the \u0022violet ray\u0022 device, marketed as a miracle cure for everything from blindness to cancer. And followers didn\u2019t just donate money\u2014they offered what the Ballards called \u201CI AM love gifts\u201D. The couple got rich. Really rich. We\u2019re talking luxury cars, jewel-draped outfits, and a mansion in Los Angeles\u2019 Griffith Park.\n\nI found out about the Ballard case though investigative journalist , whose book The Blazing Eye Sees All described how the Ballards built a massive mail-order empire rooted in belief-based commerce. The Department of Justice, however, wasn\u2019t buying it. They charged the Ballards with fraud, citing 18 specific cases where the couple made false medical claims.\n\nBut here\u2019s the twist.\n\nWhen the case reached the Supreme Court, the majority ruled that the truth or falsity of religious beliefs was not for the courts to decide. The only legal question was whether the Ballards \u201Csincerely\u201D believed what they were preaching. If they did, they were protected under the First Amendment\u2014even if what they sold was utter nonsense.\n\n\n\nBooks:\n\u2060The Wedge\u2060 \nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/the-wedge\n\n\n\u2060What Doesn\u0027t Kill Us\u2060\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/what-doesnt-kill-us\n\n\n\u2060The Enlightenment Trap\u2060\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/the-enlightenment-trap\n\nThe Vortex\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/the-vortex\n\n\nThe Red Market\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/the-red-market\n\n\n\n\n\nListen to the Scott Carney Investigates Podcast on:\n\nYouTube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2TVEkr1lWIJp6zZijbuZE8xTn5Edur-7\n\n\nApple:\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/scott-carney-investigates/id1675685319\n\n\nSpotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/show/5Eez65bpNJSDLCYQb7yck5\n\n\nAnchor:\nhttps://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/12a9Xdpn6yb\n\n\nSocial Media:\n\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@sgcarney\n\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/sgcarney/\n\nFacebook   https://www.facebook.com/scottcarneyauthor\n\nTwitter https://twitter.com/sgcarney\n\nBluesky https://staging.bsky.app/profile/sgcarney.bsky.social\n \n#joedispenza #ramtha #scams #wellness \n\n\u00A9PokeyBear LLC (2024)",

      "title": "Escaping the End Times Cult that Wants to make Project 2025 a Gospel | Breanna Brown",
      "description": "What happens when someone believes at the very core of their soul that the end of the world is just a few days, weeks or years away, and that somehow they are lucky enought toe be among a hundred people who will make it through the gates of heaven?   grew up in an evangelical christian cult that even other evangelical groups thought was a little too radical. A few years ago she escaped and started writing about her experiences re-entering the normal world\u2014a place she still calls Sodom\u2014on her substack Not a Mommy Blog (https://www.notamommyblog.ca/)\n\nHer story reminds me a little bit about David Foster Wallace\u2019s famous speech about a school of fish discussing the weather.\n\nThere are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says \u201CMorning, boys. How\u2019s the water?\u201D And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes \u201CWhat the hell is water?\u201D\n\nFor Breanna, the water was the true reality of immanent hellfire if she broke a single dictate of the Prophet. It was also the knowledge that she was special in a way that no one else could truly comprehend.  Now that she\u2019s out, the water is all mixed up with the reality of life on land. Following her blog is living that exchange through her eyes.\n\nAnother thing that I learned from this conversation was that though the people in her group followed a Biblical order, these evangelicals don\u2019t consider themselves Christians. \n\nAs someone who grew up outside any organized religion, I always sort of assumed that Christians were people who, largely speaking, followed the writings of Christ as laid down in one of a few different versions of the New Testament.  But I was amazed to learn that the wider evangelical movement that began in the 1940s doesn\u2019t necessarily think the bible is all that important. Instead, they rely on the interpretations of the bible and the direct revelations of their various, much more contemporary, prophets. In Breanna\u2019s case that meant following the visions of Rev William Branham and, for her specific group, another prophet named Terry Sproule. \n\nThose men, her group believed, were the incarnations of God on earth.  \n\nIn the case of Sproule, Breanna told me that his specific revelations closely mirrored the politics of the Heratige Foundation\u2019s Project 2025\u2014which now seems to be on the way to becoming policy in the United States.\n\nAnyone who wants to know more about cult psychology or the current state of politics will enjoy this interview.\n\n\nGet EArly Access on Substack\nhttps://sgcarney.substack.com/\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3PyxGKt94kLzVqkkjEgRFw/join\n\nPatreon: \nhttps://patreon.com/sgcarney\n\n\n\n\nScott Carney Investigates Podcast\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/podcast\n\nYouTube https://www.youtube.com/@sgcarney\n\n\nBooks:\n\u2060The Wedge\u2060 \nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/the-wedge\n\n\n\u2060What Doesn\u0027t Kill Us\u2060\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/what-doesnt-kill-us\n\n\n\u2060The Enlightenment Trap\u2060\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/the-enlightenment-trap\n\nThe Vortex\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/the-vortex\n\n\nThe Red Market\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/the-red-market\n\n\n\n\n\nListen to the Scott Carney Investigates Podcast on:\n\nYouTube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2TVEkr1lWIJp6zZijbuZE8xTn5Edur-7\n\n\nApple:\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/scott-carney-investigates/id1675685319\n\n\nSpotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/show/5Eez65bpNJSDLCYQb7yck5\n\n\nAnchor:\nhttps://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/12a9Xdpn6yb\n\n\nSocial Media:\n\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@sgcarney\n\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/sgcarney/\n\nFacebook   https://www.facebook.com/scottcarneyauthor\n\nTwitter https://twitter.com/sgcarney\n\nBluesky https://staging.bsky.app/profile/sgcarney.bsky.social\n \n#cult\n#cultlife\n#cultsurvivor\n#evangelical\n#religion\n#faith\n#spirituality\n#endtimes\n#apocalypse\n#doomsday\n#conspiracytheory\n#mentalhealth\n#trauma\n#healing\n#recovery\n\n#notamommyblog\n#davidfosterwallace\n#williambranham\n#terrysproule\n#heritagefoundation\n#project2025\n#americanright\n#christianextremism\n#cultpsychology\n#truebelief\n#storytime\n#personalstory\n#truelife\n#inspirational\n#motivational\n\n\u00A9PokeyBear LLC (2024)",

      "description": "Never hyperventilate in water. Even if Wim Hof says it\u0027s ok.  \n\nJust before he died Nova Xavier led his mother through a series of rapid breathing exercises and breath holds that he learned from Wim Hof\u2019s online video course in a community pool. Catherine Xavier had bought Wim Hof\u2019s Classic Course for $100 for her son half a year earlier, but she felt that Hof\u2019s hyperventilation didn\u2019t look totally safe.\n\n\u201COf course it\u2019s safe, mom. It\u2019s Wim Hof,\u201D he said.\n\nOver the next several minutes Nova convinced his mother to practice the breath holds and hyperventilation with him, just like like he\u2019d learned in Week 8 of Hof\u2019s online course. The rapid breathwork allowed them to spend more time underwater than they would have expected otherwise. Catherine offered to time Nova\u2019s breath holds, but he had left his phone where he recorded his breath hold times on a Wim Hof App at home. Catherine started to do laps in their community pool while Nova did the Hof Method.\n\nA few minutes later she noticed that he hadn\u2019t come up for air.\n\nHer son was already dead.\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3PyxGKt94kLzVqkkjEgRFw/join\n\nGet Exclusive Updates on Patreon: \nhttps://patreon.com/sgcarney\n\nSubstack\nhttps://sgcarney.substack.com/\n\n\nScott Carney Investigates Podcast\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/podcast\n\nYouTube https://www.youtube.com/@sgcarney\n\n\nBooks:\n\u2060The Wedge\u2060 \nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/the-wedge\n\n\n\u2060What Doesn\u0027t Kill Us\u2060\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/what-doesnt-kill-us\n\n\n\u2060The Enlightenment Trap\u2060\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/the-enlightenment-trap\n\nThe Vortex\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/the-vortex\n\n\nThe Red Market\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/the-red-market\n\n\n\n\n\nListen to the Scott Carney Investigates Podcast on:\n\nYouTube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2TVEkr1lWIJp6zZijbuZE8xTn5Edur-7\n\n\nApple:\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/scott-carney-investigates/id1675685319\n\n\nSpotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/show/5Eez65bpNJSDLCYQb7yck5\n\n\nAnchor:\nhttps://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/12a9Xdpn6yb\n\n\nSocial Media:\n\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/sgcarney/\n\nFacebook   https://www.facebook.com/scottcarneyauthor\n\nTwitter https://twitter.com/sgcarney\n\nBluesky https://staging.bsky.app/profile/sgcarney.bsky.social\n \n#wimhof #breathwork #true \n\nRegistered with the US Copyright Office July 17, 2024 \n\u00A9PokeyBear LLC (2024)",

      "title": "The Most Dangerous Cult in History",
      "description": "America has all but forgotten about the most dangerous cult in modern history\u2014one that had explicit plans to destroy the world. While the entertainment industry will churn out endless books, documentaries and podcasts about the Charles Manson murders, the mass suicides at Heaven\u2019s Gate and The People\u2019s Temple, or the government showdown at the Branch Davidian Ranch, almost no one mentions the name \u0022Aum Shinrikyo.\u201D\n\nIf it\u2019s not immediately familiar, you might remember that way back in 1995 a religious group released sarin nerve gas in the Tokyo subway that killed 13 people and injured another 5,000.\n\nWhat you probably didn\u2019t know was that Aum Shinrikyo came very close to acquiring a nuclear weapon, and in just 8 years raised more than $1 billion in revenue to carry out terrorist attacks.\nNot only that, but the organization had weapons development labs all over the world, brewed up several tons of biological and chemical weapons, and tested out the idea of setting off a world-ending earthquake by detonating a nuclear device on a tectonic fault line.\n\nI first heard about their tectonic weapons plan a few months ago while reading a travelogue by Bill Bryson about oddities in Australian history called In a Sunburned Country. He devoted a couple pages to strange occurrences on the cult\u2019s compound\u2014including a reference to a NYT story about tectonic weapons\u2014before moving on to all of the other things that can kill you in Austrailia.\n\nThe idea was pretty simple. Shoko Asahara, the cult\u2019s leader, would acquire a nuclear weapon and then detonate it on one of the fault lines around earthquake-prone Japan in the hopes that the subsequent catastrophic would set off wider geopolitical instability and hopefully World War 3. If that idea sounds like it might have come from a comic book, you might be right. It\u2019s almost the same exact plot from the 1978 classic Superman The Movie.\n\nIf they\u2019d pulled it off, the plan wasn\u2019t entirely without its merits. Last year in my book The Vortex, I wrote about a similar natural disaster in East Pakistan in 1970 that killed half a million people had geopolitical shockwaves that flipped an election, triggered a genocide and brought the world to the brink of a nuclear war between the USA and USSR. A Tokyo-destroying quake would have been much worse.\n\nIn this week\u2019s video, I wanted to see how much progress Aum Shinrikyo actually made in developing their seismic weapon.\n\n#cults #earthquake #aumshinrikyo\n\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3PyxGKt94kLzVqkkjEgRFw/join\n\nGet Exclusive Updates on Patreon: \nhttps://patreon.com/sgcarney\n\nSubstack\nhttps://sgcarney.substack.com/\n\n\nScott Carney Investigates Podcast\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/podcast\n\nYouTube https://www.youtube.com/@sgcarney\n\n\nBooks:\n\u2060The Wedge\u2060 \nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/the-wedge\n\n\n\u2060What Doesn\u0027t Kill Us\u2060\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/what-doesnt-kill-us\n\n\n\u2060The Enlightenment Trap\u2060\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/the-enlightenment-trap\n\nThe Vortex\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/the-vortex\n\n\nThe Red Market\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/the-red-market\n\nListen to the Scott Carney Investigates Podcast on:\n\nYouTube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2TVEkr1lWIJp6zZijbuZE8xTn5Edur-7\n\n\nApple:\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/scott-carney-investigates/id1675685319\n\n\nSpotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/show/5Eez65bpNJSDLCYQb7yck5\n\n\nAnchor:\nhttps://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/12a9Xdpn6yb\n\n\nSocial Media:\n\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/sgcarney/\n\nFacebook   https://www.facebook.com/scottcarneyauthor\n\nTwitter https://twitter.com/sgcarney\n\nBluesky https://staging.bsky.app/profile/sgcarney.bsky.social\n \n\u00A9PokeyBear LLC (2023)",

      "description": "In 2004 I meditated in front of a fleet of Bentleys, laughed uncontrollably as 100 people around me spoke in tongues and very nearly attended an orgy full of gorgeous spiritual seekers. Since then I delved into the neuroscience cult psychology and have a few ideas of what it takes to start a cult. This month a new TV show appeared Netflix staring Peter Dinklage called \u0022How to Become a Cult Leader.\u0022 It was a great show, but I thought they missed a few salient points.  This EP is meant to fill in some of the gaps.\n\n\nGet Exclusive Updates on Patreon: \nhttps://patreon.com/sgcarney\n\n\nSubscribe to my newsletter\nhttps://landing.mailerlite.com/webforms/landing/h1g1p6\n\n\nScott Carney Investigates Podcast\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/podcast\n\n\nYouTube https://www.youtube.com/@sgcarney\n\n\n\n\nBooks:\n\u2060The Wedge\u2060 \nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/the-wedge\n\n\n\u2060What Doesn\u0027t Kill Us\u2060\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/what-doesnt-kill-us\n\n\n\u2060The Enlightenment Trap\u2060\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/the-enlightenment-trap\n\nThe Vortex\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/the-vortex\n\n\nThe Red Market\nhttps://www.scottcarney.com/the-red-market\n\n\n\n\n\nListen to the Scott Carney Investigates Podcast on:\n\nYouTube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2TVEkr1lWIJp6zZijbuZE8xTn5Edur-7\n\n\nApple:\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/scott-carney-investigates/id1675685319\n\n\nSpotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/show/5Eez65bpNJSDLCYQb7yck5\n\n\nAnchor:\nhttps://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/12a9Xdpn6yb\n\n\nSocial Media:\n\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/sgcarney/\n\nFacebook   https://www.facebook.com/scottcarneyauthor\n\nTwitter https://twitter.com/sgcarney\n\nBluesky https://staging.bsky.app/profile/sgcarney.bsky.social\n\n#osho #cult #netflix",

      "description": "Depending who you ask, the Wim Hof method either originated out of Hof\u0027s mind after he first jumped into ice water, or it\u0027s part of an ancient tradition of breathwork and ice bathing that goes back to human pre-history. I\u0027ve decided to dig into the question to compare Wim\u0027s practices to existing Yogic practices as well as listening to Wim\u0027s own accounts of where this all started for him.
