      "title": "A victim reacts to the newly released Epstein investigation files",
      "description": "Files from the federal investigation into sex offender Jeffrey Epstein released Friday include photos, court documents, taped interviews and other materials.\n\nThe hundreds of thousands of documents released on Friday show many of Epstein\u0027s victims, whose images and other details have been heavily redacted for their protection. Some documents show hand-written testimony describing victims\u0027 interaction with Epstein.\n\nWhile the DOJ has not yet released all of the investigation files it is legally required to, at least one victim says she is vindicated.\n\nMaria Farmer reported Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell\u0027s activities to the FBI in 1996 \u2014 a fact that Friday\u0027s release confirmed.\n\nFarmer issued a statement following the release of the files:\n\n\u0022I\u0027m crying for two reasons: I want everyone to know that I\u0027m shedding tears of joy for myself, but also tears of sorrow for all of the other victims that the FBI failed.\u0022\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nJoin our newsletter at https://bit.ly/2q1tepr\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/scrippsnews/\nFollow us on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/scrippsnews\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/scrippsnews/\nFollow us on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@scrippsnews",
