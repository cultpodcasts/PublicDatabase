      "description": "The New Mexico Department of Justice is investigating public land near what was once Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s Zorro Ranch after a newly released email alleged that two foreign girls were buried there.\n\nLast week, New Mexico Public Lands Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard said she requested the probe following a 2019 email from an alleged former Epstein staffer. The email claimed two girls were killed and buried on public land leased near the ranch, about 30 miles southeast of Santa Fe.\n\nThe redacted email was part of recently released documents from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ investigation into Epstein. The deaths were allegedly at the direction of Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year federal prison sentence for sex trafficking.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nJoin our newsletter at https://bit.ly/2q1tepr\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/scrippsnews/\nFollow us on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/scrippsnews\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/scrippsnews/\nFollow us on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@scrippsnews",

Trump said the situation is \u201Cvery sad\u201D for the royal family and emphasized that he has been \u201Ctotally exonerated\u201D in matters related to Epstein.\n\nThe president also addressed rising tensions with Iran, saying a deal must be reached within 10 to 15 days or it would be \u201Cunfortunate\u201D for Tehran. \n\nIn addition, Trump responded to comments from former President Barack Obama about aliens. He also briefly weighed in on questions surrounding the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie.\n\nHere\u2019s what the president said during the exchange.\n-------------------------------------\n\nJoin our newsletter at https://bit.ly/2q1tepr\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/scrippsnews/\nFollow us on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/scrippsnews\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/scrippsnews/\nFollow us on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@scrippsnews",

Robert Garcia said. \u0022Mr. Epstein would not be the wealthy man he was without the support of Les Wexner.\u0022\n\nDemocrats said they are aware of approximately $1 billion in Wexner\u2019s wealth that was transferred to Epstein.\n\n\u0022It\u0027s important to know that Mr. Wexner appears to be unaware of much of the money that he claims that was given over to Mr. Epstein,\u0022 Garcia said. \u0022In fact, it\u0027s interesting that Mr. Wexner has already begun to clarify, in his mind, that somehow he and Mr. Epstein weren\u0027t even friends.\u0022\n\nGarcia also said Wexner, 88, traveled on Epstein\u2019s plane and visited his island.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nJoin our newsletter at https://bit.ly/2q1tepr\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/scrippsnews/\nFollow us on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/scrippsnews\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/scrippsnews/\nFollow us on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@scrippsnews",

She provides detailed accounts of childbirth with Ghislaine Maxwell allegedly in the room and of a baby, born alive, being taken away.\n\nThe first year of President Trump\u0027s push to arrest and deport undocumented immigrants was a financial boon for two companies that own and operate private detention centers.\n\nCoreCivic and The GEO Group both reported their year-end earnings for 2025.\n\nEach company reported seeing a boost in revenue of more than 13 percent, both making more than $2 billion.\n\nGEO Group\u0027s executive chairman George Zoley called 2025 the \u0022most successful year for new business wins in our company\u0027s history.\u0022\n\nThe two companies opened nine new detention centers across the country under contracts with ICE, adding thousands more beds able to hold arrested immigrants who are awaiting deportation hearings.\n\nAnd the FBI late last week told Minnesota investigators it would not share any information or evidence related to the shooting death of Alex Pretti, who died in Minneapolis in January.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nJoin our newsletter at https://bit.ly/2q1tepr\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/scrippsnews/\nFollow us on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/scrippsnews\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/scrippsnews/\nFollow us on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@scrippsnews",

      "description": "After the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) failed to fully comply with a law to release all files related to its investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a group of his survivors on Monday accused the agency of legal violations and are demanding accountability.\n\nThe DOJ faced a Friday deadline to release its massive cache of records related to the federal investigation into Epstein and his associates. However, the release sparked widespread outrage after only a portion of the documents were made public \u2014 many of which were heavily redacted.\n\nA group of 19 women, including two who chose to remain anonymous, said Monday that there is no excuse for the delay.\n\n\u0022The public received a fraction of the files, and what we received was riddled with abnormal and extreme redactions with no explanation,\u0022 the group said in a statement obtained by Scripps News. \u0022At the same time, numerous victim identities were left unredacted, causing real and immediate harm. No financial documents were released. Grand jury minutes, though approved by a federal judge for release, were fully blacked out \u2013 not the scattered redactions that might be expected to protect victim names, but 119 full pages blacked out. We are told that there are hundreds of thousands of pages of documents still unreleased. These are clear-cut violations of an unambiguous law.\u0022\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nJoin our newsletter at https://bit.ly/2q1tepr\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/scrippsnews/\nFollow us on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/scrippsnews\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/scrippsnews/\nFollow us on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@scrippsnews",
