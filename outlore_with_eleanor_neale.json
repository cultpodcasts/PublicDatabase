      "description": "England, 2023: Constance Marten was a British Aristocrat and \u2018It Girl\u2019. But the minute she left TB Joshua\u2019s church, a place with cult-like and dark allegations against it, her life unravelled. And all of this would only be made worse when a man called Mark Gordon stepped into the picture, embarking on an obsessive love love that would soon lead them to a life on the run, with their newborn daughter strapped to Constance\u2019s chest, in the freezing cold.
