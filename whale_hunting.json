      "description": "When journalist Gareth Gore began investigating the collapse of Spain\u2019s Banco Popular in 2017, he expected a predictable tale of bad investments and toxic loans. Instead, it led him to discover a vast web of hidden financial networks spread around the world, all linking back to one organization: Opus Dei. This week on Whale Hunting, Gareth joins Bradley to discuss how this secretive Catholic sect quietly wields global influence in everything from finance to policymaking and education \u2013 and how it exploits and manipulates its members to further its power. It\u2019s all in Gareth\u2019s new book, Opus: dark money, a secretive cult, and its mission to remake our world, out now in US bookshops.For more from Whale Hunting, make sure to follow the podcast \u2013 and subscribe to our newsletter at whalehunting.projectbrazen.com.
