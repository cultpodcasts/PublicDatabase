      "description": "In this episode I spoke with cult exposure expert, author and activist Rick Alan Ross. \nWe delved into the phenomenon of the different types of cults and why people join them. Rick explains how cults operate and how to identify them as well as the deprogramming process that he uses. Specifically we discussed \u201CScientology\u201D, \u201CNXIVM\u201D, and the \u201CUnification Church\u201D as well as historical cult leaders.\n\nRick is a long cult expert and deprogrammer. He is the founder of the \u201CCult Education Institute\u201D and author of the book \u201CCults Inside Out\u201D.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this conversation, please consider subscribing :)\n\nFollow Rick\u2019s Work:\n\nRick Ross\u2019s Website: https://culteducation.com\nRead Rick Ross\u2019s Book: https://cultsinsideout.com/\nFollow Rick on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RickAlanRoss\n\nFollow Me On\n\nAudio - https://linktr.ee/mikhailapeterson \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/MikhailaFuller\u200B\u200B\nInstagram -  https://www.instagram.com/mikhailapeterson/\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/mikhailapetersonpodcast\nLion Diet - https://linktr.ee/liondiet \nTelegram - https://t.me/mikhailapeterson \n\nChapters\n\n[0:00] Pre Roll \n[2:14] Intro \u0026 Background]\n[4:18] Exposing Keith Raniere and the NXIVM cult\n[5:59] The Difference Between a Cult and A Religion\n[8:37] The Dangers That Come With Exposing Cults\n[9:52] Personality of Cult Leaders\n[16:00] Where The Phrase \u201CYou Drank The Cool Aid\u201D Came From\n[19:31] The Growth Of Cults Online\n[20:32] What Type Of Person Ends Up In A Cult?\n[23:47] Recognizing A Cult \u0026 Influence Techniques\n[30:31] The Most Popular Cults In America \n[33:34] The Truth About Scientology\n[38:05] Cult Deprogramming\n[49:25] The \u201CExit Cost\u201D Of Leaving A Cult\n[53:19] The Most Destructive Cults\n[56:42] Different Specific Types of Cults\n[1:02:39] Is QAnon A Cult?\n[1:06:29] Cult Like Characteristics Of MLM Companies\n[1:11:36] Political Associations and Cult like Behaviour \n[1:15:15] Female Cult Leaders \n[1:20:51] Historic Cult Leaders\n\n#MikhailaPeterson #MikhailaPetersonPodcast #RickAlanRoss #CultLeaders #Scientology",
