Thank you to www.campuspress.com for sponsoring this series. Support the show by subscribing to the MartyrMade Substack. Huge thanks to the folks behind the Alternative Considerations of Jonestown Project. This podcast wouldn\u0027t have been possible without their indispensable hard work recording, organizing, and transcribing the Peoples Temple tapes and other source materials. For further information about Jonestown, you can\u0027t do better than their website. I did my best to tell the story here as I understand it, but if you ask me the work they\u0027re doing will lead to a fundamental future reassessment of what happened.",

      "description": "This episode begins where the \u002760s end, when the radicalism of that decade crash headlong into the diminishing expectations of 1970s America. The Weather Underground veers off toward its explosive climax. As the idealism of the student movement is shunted into self-help fads and therapy sessions, what remaining energy of the radical left is drained into increasingly bizarre and violent channels. I broke this episode up into two parts, so it ends a bit abruptly. The second segment will be available a few hours after this is released. Support the show by subscribing to the MartyrMade Substack.
