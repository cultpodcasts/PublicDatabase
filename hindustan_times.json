The files include internal emails, flight logs, handwritten notes and disputed allegations, with records suggesting Trump flew on Epstein\u2019s private jet multiple times in the 1990s. The documents also reference rape allegations and a controversial handwritten letter attributed to Epstein, which the DOJ has since declared fake. Trump has denied wrongdoing, saying ties with Epstein ended years ago. The Justice Department stressed Trump faces no criminal charges and warned that some released material contains false or unverified claims submitted before the 2020 election.\n\nINTERNATIONAL NEWS\n\n#JeffreyEpstein #EpsteinFiles #DonaldTrump #USJusticeDepartment #DOJ #USPolitics #USNews #EpsteinInvestigation #WorldNews\n\n\nDownload the Hindustan Times App from Playstore/App Store for all the latest news \u0026 updates.\ngoogle app store : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ht.news\u0026hl=en_IN\u0026pli=1\n\nApple Store : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ht.news\u0026hl=en_IN\u0026pli=1\n\nAdd Hindustan Times as your preferred source on Google.

Andrew continues to deny allegations of misconduct, including those made by Virginia Giuffre.

      "description": "A royal scandal has crossed the Atlantic and it\u2019s shaking the very foundations of power in Washington. Prince Andrew\u2019s fall from grace may look like a belated act of royal accountability, but its ripple effect has reached U.S. politics, reopening the dark chapter known as the Epstein files. As the King strips his brother of titles, questions in Washington are growing louder: What do these files really contain? Who is protecting them and why? At the center stands Donald Trump, once photographed with Epstein and now accused of shielding information he once vowed to release. And then came Elon Musk\u2019s explosive tweet claiming Trump\u2019s name was in those files, a post quickly deleted, but not forgotten. From Buckingham Palace to Capitol Hill, this story isn\u2019t just about power, it\u2019s about who dares to face the ghosts of the past when they come knocking again. \n#EpsteinFiles, #PrinceAndrew, #TrumpControversy, #BuckinghamPalace, #WhiteHouseScandal, #RoyalCrisis, #JeffreyEpstein, #EpsteinCase, #WashingtonDC, #PowerAndPrivilege, #PoliticalScandal, #TrumpNews, #ElonMusk, #RoyalFamily, #EpsteinConnection, #JusticeDepartment, #USPolitics, #CampaignTrail, #ScandalInThePalace, #Accountability, #BreakingNews, #PowerCorridors, #TruthAndConsequences, #EpsteinInvestigation \n\nAdd Hindustan Times as your preferred source on Google.

      "description": "The end of the USSR in 1991 was one of the most cataclysmic events in history, with its aftereffects still being felt three decades on. But there was one such moment triggered at the same time, that was unforeseen. It was the rise of a new religious order in a remote corner of Russia, powered by the \u0027spiritual awakening\u0027 of a man. Meet Sergei Torop, or as he is popularly known, the \u0027Vissarion\u0027. In the 1990s, Torop claimed he was the reincarnation of Jesus of Nazareth. A new Church was established, Torop amassed thousands of followers but then came his fall from grace, he was subjected to thorough investigation leading to a severe directive from the Russian state.\n\n\nIn this episode of HT In-Depth, we look at the history of Sergei Torop\u0027s cult, from his \u0027divine revelation\u0027, to the establishment of his new \u0027Church\u0027, and the perceived end of his massive cult. Watch this video for full details on the Vissarion.\n\n\nINTERNATIONAL NEWS\n\n#russia #christianity #jesus #jesuschrist #virginmary #religion #vissarion #fsb #vladimirputin #putin\n\nHindustan Times Videos brings all the News for the Global Indian under one umbrella.
