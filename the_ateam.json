      "description": "A crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn\u0027t commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the A-Team.\n\nBuy all the seasons here: \nSeason one: http://bit.ly/3ozUyUR\nSeason two: http://bit.ly/39ae97f\nSeason three: http://bit.ly/3pXUYVi\nSeason four: http://bit.ly/3nkMIwH\nSeason five: http://bit.ly/2LxscvO\n\n#TheATeam #ClassicTV #ShutUpFool",
