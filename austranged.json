      "description": "Across pop culture we have seen and heard the rise and fall of many different types of cults. From new age religious groups to extreme political parties to even some self-help clubs, we are naturally curious as to what goes on behind the fence of cult groups and how people fall victim to the likes of Jim Jones and Shoko Asahara.
