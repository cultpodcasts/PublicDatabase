      "description": "Join Brother Paul and special guest Chris Shelton (MSc) as they discuss everything Scientology. Most people by now have at least heard of Scientology and some may have a rough idea of what it is, but what is it really? On one hand Scientology HQ claim they are a religion, on the other hand researchers and more importantly the survivors who have escaped the clutches of L Ron Hubbards organisation say it is without doubt a very dangerous \u0026 abusive cult! Cults, their ideologies and practices can be destructive beyond ones imagination and in the worst cases can result in the ultimate price being paid by followers of the cult or those who get in the way of the cults aims. Many lose their lives to these groups. Jonestown in1978 (over 900 dead), Waco in 1993 (over 70 dead) \u0026 Heaven\u2019s Gate 1997 (39 dead) to name just a few. Tragedies that should never have happened, but heartbreaking to say, did. Chris Shelton is a brave 2nd generation survivor who spent a large portion of his life controlled by the powerful psychological conditioning, manipulation and trauma of Scientology\u2019s cult indoctrination program. He is now an author, podcast host and campaigner. He dedicates his life to educate those vulnerable to future cult indoctrination so they at least have informed consent when considering joining Scientology or any cult for that matter. Through his You Tube channel and podcasts he also tries to help those who have broken free from cult life to deprogram and recover and give them the best opportunity to adjust to normal life within society. Chris\u2019s story is one to be celebrated and admired by us all. Finding that inner strength to pull away from the hellscape of the Scientology church he grew up in, coming through adversity, abuse and struggle like that to form a successful happy life afterwards is the perfect example of the hero\u2019s journey. Chris\u2019s excellent book \u2018A-Xenu An insiders guide to what scientology is really all about\u2019 is the perfect educational tool for researchers like you the listener when it comes to the cult of Scientology as it details the inner workings of the organisation and what it is they really worship behind closed doors in the upper levels of the bridge.
