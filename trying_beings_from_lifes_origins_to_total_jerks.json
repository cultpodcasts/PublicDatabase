We have an entirely natural explanation for how self-regenerating beings (like us) could emerge from chemistry and evolve (by natural selection) the capacity to use DNA molecules.  \n\nMOTIVATION: Psychologists just assume it. When they see effort, they assume a motivation, which is like assuming a \u0022soul.\u0022 We have an explanation for what effort and motivation physically are: Not something added to chemistry but the way chemistry can limit itself by channeling energy into work to regenerate itself. \n\nNARCISSISM: Psychologists say that if you\u0027ve got these symptoms, you have a thing called Narcissism. I explain how humans, having evolved language, can imagine the ideal, see where we fall short, and self-idealize to compensate. It\u0027s something we all do.

I\u0027m a soulnerd with a deeply connected heart and head. This stuff is my non-spiritual path. I live and breathe my work. It\u0027s not some abstract intellectual exercise. \n\nNor is it art. Science is a campaign to find natural explanations for all natural phenomena \u2013 natural, not supernatural - about which you can believe anything.\n\nStill, I try to make this stuff fun, intuitive, and useful. I\u0027ve written over 1,100 blog articles for Psychology Today on practical decision-making and everything we all go through (11 million views).
