      "description": "Forget everything you think you know about organized religion. Today, we\u2019re digging into the baffling, billion-dollar saga of Scientology.\n\nL. Ron Hubbard started with a failed self-help book, then, in a stroke of pure pragmatic genius, decided to pivot to faith. We\u2019re dissecting the entire absurd journey:\n\nWhat is it? Beyond the E-meters and auditing, we expose the secretive, multi-million-dollar path to \u0022total freedom\u0022\u2014including the infamous, frankly hilarious, Xenu space-opera doctrine.\n\nHow did it get legitimized? We unpack the brutal, 40-year legal war against the IRS that ended with a controversial tax-exempt victory, and how the \u0022Attack the Attacker\u0022 policy secured its status.\n\nThe Price of Belief: From the early days of Dianetics to the modern-day cult allegations, we track the moment public perception soured and how the internet finally laid its most bizarre secrets bare.\n\nThis isn\u0027t just history; it\u0027s a breakdown of how pseudoscience became a profitable religion. Shall we peel back the layers of this fascinating nonsense?\n\nSUBSCRIBE to my other channel here \u27A1\uFE0F   https://www.youtube.com/@creakyblindershow\n\n\uD83D\uDFE1PLEASE CONSIDER BECOMING A PATREON\nhttps://www.patreon.com/thecreakyblinder\n\n\uD83D\uDFE1Website \u0026 Merch Store\nhttps://creakyblinder.com/\n\n\uD83D\uDFE1Want to sell your own merch? click here https://link.fourthwall.com/ref/tidy-clothing-company\n\n\uD83D\uDFE1Find Me Everywhere https://tspnr.com/creakyblinder\n\nMy Editor (Callum)\n\uD83D\uDFE1https://www.dunechickenediting.com/\n\n\uD83D\uDFE1 All my glasses are from the good folks over at https://pop-specs.com/ tell them Creaky sent you.\n\n\uD83D\uDFE1 If you enjoy my channel and would like to support what I do there are a few different ways you can show your support listed below: \n\n\uD83D\uDFE1Support the channel via PayPal if you don\u0027t want anyone taking a chunk of what you send me and you can set up a recurring payment \nhttps://paypal.me/creakyblinder \n\n\uD83D\uDFE1BECOME A CHANNEL MEMBER ON YOUTUBE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUY9W5q3zd2zUkpEcMvQh4w/join\n\n\uD83D\uDFE1Amazon Wish List, Things The Channel Needs https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/3MVMPACQEHD99/ref=nav_wishlist_lists_1?_encoding=UTF8\u0026type=wishlist\n========================================================================\n\uD83D\uDFE1MY SOCIAL MEDIA \n\uD83D\uDFE1Join the conversation on Discord \u27A1\uFE0F  https://discord.gg/zEgh7uAhWQ\n\uD83D\uDFE1Follow me on Twitter \u27A1\uFE0F https://twitter.com/creakyblinder\n\uD83D\uDFE1Follow me on Instagram \u27A1\uFE0F https://www.instagram.com/thecreakyblinder/\n\uD83D\uDFE1Like my Facebook Page \u27A1\uFE0F https://www.facebook.com/thecreakyblinder\n\uD83D\uDFE1Got your own channel?
