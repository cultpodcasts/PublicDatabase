      "description": "In this episode of the Time with Tim podcast, Tim and Andy speak again with Jenna Miscavige Hill. Jenna grew up in the Church of Scientology, a world shaped by control, suppression, secrecy, and fear. As the niece of Scientology\u2019s leader, David Miscavige, she was immersed in a system designed to break individuality and demand absolute loyalty. But Jenna had something that system couldn\u2019t erase\u2014her own mind. In time, she found the strength to question, to break free, and to reclaim her life.\n\nJenna opens up about her Scientology upbringing, delving into the raw emotions of abandonment and shame that shaped her identity. She offers a candid look at her journey towards self-trust and healing, sharing how mindfulness became her lifeline. Jenna and Tim unpack the thorny issues of authority and relationships, exploring how childhood experiences can cast long shadows into adulthood. They tackle the challenge of breaking free from limiting beliefs and discuss the delicate art of setting boundaries \u2013 both with oneself and as a parent. Throughout their conversation, a powerful message emerges: embracing imperfection and showing self-compassion are key to personal growth and fostering healthier connections with our children and ourselves.\n\nFollow @JennaMiscavige on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@JennaMiscavige/\nBuy \u0027Beyond Belief: My Secret Life Inside Scientology and My Harrowing Escape\u0027: https://a.co/d/i8see05\n\n\uD83C\uDFA7 Listen to the Time with Tim Fletcher Podcast on the go: \nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/41H1aq9\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/4bwSKFo\nAmazon Music: https://amzn.to/4kjUxSd\n\n\u25B6 Explore our most popular C-PTSD Recovery Course as a Self-Study: https://bit.ly/3XtNCv6 \n\u25B6 Do you have complex trauma?
