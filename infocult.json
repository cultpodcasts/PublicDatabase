      "description": "Presentation of Marie-Andr\u00E9e Pelland and Mike Kropveld at the ICSA 2023 Annual International Conference, in Louisville, Kentucky June 29- July 1, 2023\n\nIn 2023, Info-Cult celebrated 43 years of serving the public! Founded in Montreal (Quebec, Canada) in 1980, Info-Cult is a non-profit  organization that offers information and assistance about groups - their ideology, structure and functioning.\n\nThis presentation provides an overview of Info-Cult with regard to its conceptualization of religious, new religious, and cultic movements. The presenters discuss the circumstances surrounding the creation of the organization and how its perspective on cultic phenomena has evolved over time. They also highlight how the organization has developed an approach that goes beyond labels (cults, new religious movements, extremist, radical or coercive groups) in order to help people in  understanding their individual experiences in groups.",
