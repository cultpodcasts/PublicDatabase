As police investigations closed in and members began to leave, the leaders doubled down \u2014 orchestrating a series of events that would result in mass suicide and murder across Switzerland, Canada, and France.\n\nTodays episode is sponsored by WOLF ESCAPE GAMES - get your exclusive discount at www.wolfescapegames.com and use the discount code \u0027KILLERS\u0027 at checkout. \n\nIn this episode, we explore:\n\nThe collapse of the Order of the Solar Temple\n\nHow fake apparitions and occult theatre kept members compliant\n\nThe role of \u201CTransit\u201D in justifying mass death\n\nThe warning signs authorities missed\n\nWhy this case still haunts cult investigations today\n\n\u26A0\uFE0F Content warning: This episode discusses coercive control, sexual abuse, the exploitation of minors, suicide, and murder.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in cult psychology, true crime documentaries, or cases like Jonestown, Heaven\u2019s Gate, and WACO, this is one you won\u2019t forget.\n\n\uD83D\uDC51 Hosted by Cheryl Hole and Nikki Druce.\n\nGot a theory?

This week on Killers, Cults \u0026 Queens, Nikki Druce and Cheryl The Queen investigate the Order of the Solar Temple, one of the most infamous cults of the 20th century. Founded by Joseph Di Mambro and Luc Jouret, the group claimed sacred connections to the Knights Templar and promised its followers salvation when the apocalypse arrived. Instead, members were subjected to manipulation, sexual \u201Chealing\u201D rituals, staged supernatural events, and a terrifying ideology \u2014 all of which led to international tragedy. In Part One, we uncover: \u2728 Why people are drawn to charismatic cult leaders \u2728 How spirituality and control became dangerously intertwined \u2728 The role the Waco Siege played in pushing the cult underground \u2728 The early warning signs of the mass deaths to come Dive into the chilling psychology behind cult belief, and prepare yourself for Part Two\u2026 where the Solar Temple\u2019s darkest secrets ignite into unimaginable horror.

      "description": "This week on Spooky Sleepover, we\u0027re coming to you LIVE from CrimeCon with true crime YouTube star Eleanor Neale! Join us as we count down some of the deadliest, most chilling cults in history... including the ones that still haunt us today. Plus, discover a so-called \u0022community\u0022 that\u0027s still active... and might just be recruiting. Could you be part of it? We had a great time recording with Eleanor at CrimeCon2025. Her section on the Twin Flame Universe was incredibly interesting. We reached out to the Twin Flame Universe for comment, and we just wanted to share their responses to some of the issues raised. Jeff and Shaleia want to make it clear that they do not condone or encourage any illegal behaviour and have said that there have never been any criminal charges or evidence of criminal wrongdoing against Twin Flames Universe, Jeff and/or Shaleia. In response to the suggestion that the TFU encourages stalking and harassment, they told us that they communicate frequently in Twin Flame Ascension School about the importance of having personal boundaries and honouring the boundaries of others however, they have said they cannot control the actions of others. In response to the allegation that treatment at the TFU culminated in a former member taking their own life, they said that this was suggestion was incorrect. They said a member of the public who was already under medical care registered online for a free consultation with the Mind Alignment Process (MAP) - a separate company also owned by Jeff Divine - but never attended it. Sadly, this individual later died by suicide. MAP practitioners make it clear they are not medical professionals, and their services are not a substitute for therapy or medical care. On the allegation that The TFU encourages members to transition into a different gender they told us that they never encourage any of their members to partake in any discussions or decisions that they are not comfortable with or that are not directly expressed by the students themselves. They concluded by saying that TFU is always respectful and conscientious of people\u2019s individual choices and identities, and that their community is open and unapologetically supportive of all LGBTQ\u0026#43; members.
