      "description": "Zoom Meeting with Dan \u0026 Angela \u0026 Ruby About Criminal Prosecution of Governing Body of Jehovah Witnesses 2024. We are still working on this goal and we are still gathering voices to speak out and join us.\n\nWHEN counseling his fellow worker Timothy as to how he should deal with problems in Ephesus, where some were stirring up fruitless discussions and contradictory teachings, the apostle Paul included these words: \u201CReprove before all onlookers persons who practice sin, that the rest also may have fear.\u201D\u2014 1 Tim. 5:20; 1:3-7; 6:3-5. \n\nThis means that the entire congregation should be present to witness reproving. When did elders start reproving behind closed doors and how is that scriptural? It is not scriptural but it certainly gives them all the power and control and to keep those being reproved from the rest of the congregation. This gives elders the power of judge and jury and does not protect the congregation from those committing sins. \n\nIn the world a court hearing is public so that all may have the opportunity to see and hear all the testimony and be able to judge for themselves. The accused has the right to be represented and to bring witnesses. In congregations those reproving are often friends of those being reproved which makes for bias. In worldly courts it is a considered conflict of interest for a judge to know the accused. That would be reason enough for a case to be thrown out. Watchtower judicial hearings are neither scriptural nor by secular laws. They only serve their own masters, the governing body.   \n\nWhy are JW\u0027s so gullible? Does it not say persons who practice sin??????What about PEDOPHILES????? Do they not practice sin?????  The first Christians included the entire congregation on what we would call a judicial hearing. When and why has that changed and why have all JW\u2019s accepted it or adapted it? The answer, whatever the governing body tells elders to do they do even if it contradicts the scriptures!!!!!! \n\nI am taking the elders of two congregations and the Canadian branch to the Human Rights Tribunal in British Columbia, Canada. We are all victims of Human Rights violations by the Watchtower and elders. We need to unite and be witnesses for those of us who take the Watchtower and elders to court.",
