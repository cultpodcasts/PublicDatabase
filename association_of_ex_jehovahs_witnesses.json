      "description": "Antonio Madaleno \u2013 Ex-Elder of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and Author of The Universe of Destructive Cults;\n\nThe Secret World of Deception, Manipulation, and Mind Control \n\nIt says in the Bible that we were created with a spiritual need. As a result religion is very often used to lure unsuspecting victims into their cult. \n\nHave you ever wondered why there are so many religions and yet they all claim to be the true one, the only true one, and they usually point the faults of all the other religions. \n\nReligions are not the only lure used by cults. \n\nCharismatic leaders use other lures to draw their victims under their control. They exert influence on their follower, manipulating minds and controlling their lives to the extreme. \n\nThe Universe of Destructive Cults was written to help people\n\nNOT BE A VICTIM OF DESTRUCTIVE CULTS TO BEGIN WITH BY BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY THEM AND IF YOU ARE IN ONE HOW TO LEAVE AND STOP BEING A VICTIM EVER AGAIN\n\nWritten in Portuguese",
