      "description": "This song was written by musician Bruce Thompson in the UK. He was born into the Exclusive Brethren (PBCC) and left with his young family in 2022. While inside, he witnessed firsthand the cover-up of childhood sexual abuse, the central role money played in maintaining control, and the worship of one man on earth. This song is about his journey to freedom and breaking free from an oppressive environment. \u201CFreedom Blues\u201D, which he wrote, reflects his new chapter of life and liberation. It was performed by Californian musician Dave Booda at the end of the live-streamed Cult Survivor Story Jam at Decult 2024, New Zealand\u2019s first cult awareness conference.\n\nFind more info about Decult on https://decult.net/",
