      "description": "Joan Cichon became involved with Integral Yoga in 1968 after experiencing personal crises that led them to seek greater control of their mind and a more meaningful way of life. Initially, the spiritual community and Swami Satchidananda\u0027s teachings were just what Joan needed. But the more time they spent at Yogaville, the more they noticed troubling patterns, like community members worshiping Swami Satchidananda as a God and neighbors excusing harmful behavior in the name of yoga. Joan was featured in the Netflix mini series Tiger King: The Doc Antle Story where they were interviewed about their experience witnessing the community\u0027s response to Antle impregnating an underage girl. Drawing on their deep understanding of yogic philosophy, Joan helps explain how spiritual teachings can be manipulated and weaponized to exploit vulnerable seekers.\n\n\n\nSurvivingSatchidananda.com (http://SurvivingSatchidananda.com)",
