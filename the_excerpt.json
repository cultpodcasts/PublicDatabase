      "description": "When people talk about the crime of sex trafficking they often think of girls and women. But there are male victims of sex trafficking too. The recent arrest and indictment of former Abercrombie \u0026 Fitch CEO Michael Jeffries on charges of international sex trafficking and interstate prostitution could bring dozens of men out of the shadows to talk about their trauma. Could this be the beginning of a broader reckoning involving male victims of trafficking? Steven Procopio, a licensed clinical social worker who specializes in men\u2019s issues including sexual abuse and sex trafficking, joins The Excerpt to talk about this often overlooked community of survivors.\n#podcast #news #abercrombieandfitch",

The theme this year is \u0022Leave No Child Behind in the Fight Against Human Trafficking.\u0022 Children, particularly girls, remain at great risk here. A staggering 1 in 3 victims of human trafficking globally is a child. How can we prevent this type of exploitation and what\u2019s being done to end human trafficking both in the U.S. and globally? Emma Ecker, a Senior Policy Specialist with Freedom Network USA,  the largest coalition working on human trafficking in America, joins The Excerpt to share the progress that\u0027s been made and lay out the challenges that continue to impede efforts to end the practice altogether.\n#podcast #girls #freedom",
