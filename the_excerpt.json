The recent arrest and indictment of former Abercrombie \u0026 Fitch CEO Michael Jeffries on charges of international sex trafficking and interstate prostitution could bring dozens of men out of the shadows to talk about their trauma. Could this be the beginning of a broader reckoning involving male victims of trafficking? Steven Procopio, a licensed clinical social worker who specializes in men\u2019s issues including sexual abuse and sex trafficking, joins The Excerpt to talk about this often overlooked community of survivors.\n#podcast #news #abercrombieandfitch",
