      "description": "In this episode of the Label Free Podcast, host Deanna Radulescu interviews Dr. Darla Shaw, the CEO and co-founder of Talent Masters. Dr. Darla shares her incredible journey from being raised in a white nationalist cult to becoming a champion of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) in the workplace. She discusses how her upbringing in the cult shaped her perspective and motivated her to create a business focused on human-first hiring practices. Dr. Darla emphasizes the importance of questioning what we\u0027ve been taught and encourages listeners to verify information from multiple sources. She shares insights on building inclusive communities and the impact of her work in bridging gaps in society. Dr. Darla also highlights the charitable aspect of Talent Masters, where 10% of profits are donated to human rights organizations.
