      "description": "Sarah Edmondson is on the podcast today! And wow, she has a story! She is a former member of NXIVM. She ended up leaving the group and came forward about things that were happening behind the scenes there. Sarah\u2019s full story as a whistleblower is featured in the CBC podcast \u201CUncover: Escaping NXIVM\u201D (downloaded over 25 million times) and \u201CThe Vow\u201D, the critically acclaimed HBO documentary series on NXIVM. In 2019, Sarah published Scarred: The True Story of How I Escaped NXIVM, the Cult that Bound My Life, with Kristine Gasbarre. In this tell-all memoir, she shares her story from the moment she takes her first seminar to her harrowing fight to get out of NXIVM, collaborate with the FBI, help others, and heal. She has a podcast called \u201CA Little Bit Culty\u201D where she helps people understand, heal from, and avoid abusive situations, one little red flag at a time. Sarah is also the mom of two and we talk in this conversation a bit about how she parents with this knowledge that she has and protecting your kids from people with bad intentions. I loved this conversation and I hope that you do too!
