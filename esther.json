      "description": "One of my viewers wrote a letter explaining a rather odd behavior in her family. While her side of the family is not Jehovah\u2019s Witness, her husband\u2019s side was raised in the religion, but hubby was never active. She is very comfortable and relaxed with the immediate side of her own family and they freely express and interact with one another lovingly. On the other hand, when her hubby\u2019s family members sporadically come around, she senses a very different feeling. She describes it as a stiffness, an artificiality, a feeling that she must watch herself. Why is that? Is it really true that JW religious judgment and comparison generates fear? I have a theory.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video like, subscribe, and click the notification bell.

      "description": "After one short announcement with my name in it, the process of getting disfellowshipping quite literally cut me off from my family. My kids were to cut me out of their lives. This happened a month after the death of my beloved mom, when I was still grieving over losing her. \nBlog: https://estherharrison.net/getting-disfellowshipped/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_phoenixoffaith\nBe free to Like, Subscribe, Hit the Notification bell, and Share!",
