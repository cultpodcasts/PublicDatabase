      "description": "Trigger warning: This episode discusses eating disorders, substance abuse, domestic violence and pregnancy loss.\n\nBianca is a full-service sex worker addicted to feeling good. When she works, the urge for alcohol and drugs disappears, but for as long as she can remember, she has been chasing dopamine through binge eating, ice addiction, or sex. In this episode, we dive into how one addiction can replace another, her abusive past with men, and her accidental involvement with a Russian sex cult.\n\nReady to share your story?
