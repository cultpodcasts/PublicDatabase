So today\u0027s episode is a special one. It\u0027s a little bit happy and celebratory, and it\u0027s also a little bit sad. This episode is for the foreseeable future the last episode of Uncertain. It is the end of an era, the end of a journey, and also the beginning of one, I hope. Is the fifth season. We\u0027re ending the fifth season. There are five seasons of Uncertain. There\u0027s also over a hundred episodes. That\u0027s a really big deal. I was planning to sort of end the season with the episode from last week with Janai Amon talking about the How to prepare for telling your story publicly in a safe way.\nI was really excited about that episode. I was prepared to end on that episode. And then I met with the board of directors for tears of Eden. Yes, we have a [00:01:00] board of directors. We are a nonprofit. All non profits have a board of directors, and I was really thrilled that they suggested, hey, why don\u0027t we do like a final celebratory episode in which we, the board, interview you, Katherine, about the journey we\u0027re on.\nwith Uncertain. And I honestly was so in the zone of like, okay, I need to finish the season. I need to wrap it up. I need to get everything out. I need to do the promo and I need to do the recording and I need to do the editing and just kind of full on just work task mode. And so the fact that the board suggested, hey, let\u0027s do an episode to sort of commemorate and celebrate.\nThat was really helpful. I really appreciated it. It meant so much to me and this episode meant a lot to me as well. This whole journey has meant so much to me. I\u0027m going to talk more about it in the episode itself during the interview. Be sure to sign up for our newsletter, the Tears of Eden newsletter, so that you can stay [00:02:00] updated on everything that is continuing to happen with Tears of Eden, including but not limited to a book about spiritual abuse that I am currently writing and will be releasing next year 2025. Thank you all so much for listening. Uh, so before I start crying, I will turn it over to the board of directors of Tears of Eden.\nHere is the final episode where the board of directors interviews Katherine Spearing \nErin: Will you like edit things? Oh, definitely. I\u0027ll definitely \nKatherine: edit it. Yeah. And I\u0027ll probably just kind of speak, speak openly, and then decide later if I care.\nyou\u0027re gonna edit \nErin: yourself.

She\u0027s also the author of the book, When Religion Hurts You.\nShe\u0027s awesome. She\u0027s the boss. I work with her and a bunch of other really great practitioners over there.

I am currently accepting a few new clients, and there are several other practitioners that are also accepting clients. I know that\u0027s a big thing that comes up a lot in the religious trauma spiritual abuse [00:01:00] world is folks just really struggling to find a mental health professional that understands religious trauma and spiritual abuse and the nuances and complexities of the subculture of evangelicalism and church culture.\nSo if that is something that you are looking for, I encourage you to check them out. The link will be in the show notes. Also in April of this year, I signed a book deal with Lake Dry Books. My book, Surprise Surprise is about spiritual abuse. It will be coming out in sometime in 2025.\n\u00A0Date is yet to be determined, so I encourage you to sign up for Tears of Eden\u0027s mailing list for updates on the release of that book.

I\u0027m not seeing that a lot in the literature today. Our guest a couple of weeks ago, Krista Brown, she made that connection in her memoir, Baptist Land. But outside of that, it\u0027s not really a common thing that folks are addressing.\n\u00A0So I felt like it was a pretty important subject to navigate in my book. It\u0027s going to be mostly.

I know that with most of the clients that I work with, they [00:01:00] have already worked with therapists before in the past.\nBut one of the main things that they struggled with in their therapy relationship was that the therapist didn\u0027t understand the nuances and the complexities of the subculture of evangelicalism. \nSo if you are looking for a mental health practitioner to help you navigate the complex and confusing and very painful journey of recovering from religious trauma and the trauma from spiritual abuse, I encourage you to check them out.

      "description": "Described as \u0022the public face\u0022 of Baptist clergy sex abuse survivors, Christa Brown was one of the first to go public with substantiated child sex abuse allegations against a Baptist minister and documentation that others knew. Since then, for nearly two decades, she has worked to shine a light on the systemic problem of abuse and cover-ups in Baptistland. Christa has been touted in the London Times as \u0022a whistleblower of historic proportions.\u0022 Her work was spotlighted on ABC\u0027s 20/20, and she has been quoted and featured in numerous news outlets, including New York Times, Washington Post, Associated Press, Houston Chronicle, VICE, Religion News Service, Tennessean, National Public Radio, Baptist News Global, Christianity Today, and Huffington Post. After a 25-year career as an appellate attorney, Christa became a yoga teacher. As a runner, she once placed first in her age-category in a 10-K. \u0022It was a rainy, blustery day, and I gained the edge by simply showing up,\u0022 she says. Though a native Texan, Christa currently lives with her husband in Colorado where she loves to hike in the Rocky Mountains. She is a proud mom and grandma.

Today I am with Krista Brown discussing her new memoir, Baptist Land, where she discusses her experiences addressing clergy sexual abuse within the Southern Baptist Convention it\u0027s a very powerful book. And it is a very needed book for this day and age when it seems like every day we have another story in the news about another clergy person abusing a congregant, a [00:01:00] child. It\u0027s rampant. So, super important book. Really hope that you get a chance to read it. During the interview, we had some internet connection issues. I did my best to remove some of the bumps and clicks and gaps. Hopefully it will not impact your listening experience today. Here is my interview with Krista Brown. Katherine: How are you doing today, Krista? How has it been since the launch of the book? Christa: Well, it\u0027s been very busy since the launch of the book, but I\u0027m very, very gratified and grateful for for the positive response that there\u0027s been. Katherine: Yeah, absolutely. What are some consistent things that you\u0027ve been receiving from folks? Christa: Well, I think among survivors church to survivors, There\u0027s a lot in it that really resonates with people and, and I\u0027m glad for that because I [00:02:00] think it helps people See some of the patterns of their own lives and realize that they aren\u0027t alone. But of course, it\u0027s not just for survivors I mean it also I think has been resonating with a lot of people who simply grew up in these very high control kinds of Religious environments And they see their own, they see those patterns too, even if they aren\u0027t the patterns of direct sexual abuse, they\u0027re also the patterns, just how much they were under the thumb of this religious control. Katherine: I think that\u0027s one of the things that I really appreciate about the book is that you\u0027re not just saying here is the abuse and the abuse is bad and this is why abuse is bad. You\u0027re also exposing the theological foundation that is where the the soil for where that abuse grows. Exactly. And I don\u0027t I feel like that is missing in a lot of literature about abuse in the church. There\u0027s like this [00:03:00] like qualifying statement of just like, but don\u0027t worry, the church is still good. It\u0027s just these bad people doing these bad things. And I really appreciate how you expose. Oh, it\u0027s a lot more than just a handful of folks being abusive and doing bad things. really appreciate that. Christa: Yes. And all of that soil, as you call it is very, very powerful and the, the control and the authority and the domination that derives from it is very insidious. Katherine: Yeah, Christa: and I think can be enormously harmful. Katherine: Yes, absolutely. And so complex as you, you showed of just all the different dynamics and for you specifically, you had abuse happening in your home. At the same time as it was happening in the church. And so it was just kind of all, all of these layers [00:04:00] of social dynamics and family dynamics and power dynamics all wrapped up and, you know, faith in God and all Christa: normalized. Yes, not only normalized but legitimized by the faith. Katherine: And anytime. Anytime. you expressed any like said no or I\u0027m uncomfortable or I don\u0027t like this or fight for yourself then it was like immediate gaslighting and immediate like You are the problem. And of course, it\u0027s perpetuated of anyone who like, just like raises their hand and just says like, I\u0027m a, I\u0027m a little, you know, and then for incentive for people to even fight. No, it\u0027s happening, but like, to even fight to try and change it. It\u0027s you just get squashed so fast. Christa: That is exactly right. And that\u0027s. Why it\u0027s so very [00:05:00] hard for people, I think, to step outside of these environments because You know, it\u0027s like you\u0027re put in this little box and you try to occasionally peek outside that box and you get poked in the eye, you know, and you reach a hand outside the box and it gets slapped down and that box is pretty tight. It Katherine: really is. It really is. What are some things that are common for you and for you have seen as common for survivors that are things that are just associated with this type of abuse, the sexual abuse, the spiritual abuse that\u0027s happening in these communities that make it difficult for them to interact with faith communities? Christa: Well, I mean, the, the faith community itself and all of the accoutrements of faith are often kind of neurologically networked in with sexual abuse. And that\u0027s not a cognitive thing that people [00:06:00] hold in their heads. It\u0027s, it\u0027s a physiological response. It\u0027s not as if we can reason our way out of it and say, Oh, well, fine. I\u0027m going back to my faith group. Because there were these good things over there because it\u0027s all kind of intermixed together neurologically in the same way that that language is intermixed with everything we hold and think. And I think it\u0027s very hard for people at the same time. And a lot of ways if we were, you know, if we\u0027ve been raised in these faith groups. from toddler hood. It\u0027s almost like we have a chip implanted in our brain because it\u0027s very, very hard to get past that that control because we have been indoctrinated and raised To give religious leaders the benefit of the doubt, to be trusting of them to give grace to be good and all that goes along with, with goodness and being good. Oh, it would just not be so [00:07:00] good, right? Katherine: But then for the good people, like it works on the good people. And. majority of folks are and so as you just kind of get like sucked into this vortex of just like constant inundation I call it like alien body snatching. We\u0027ve just been inhabited by a foreign substance that is controlling us. Oh my gosh. So real. Yeah. Interested in listening to more than 40 archived Uncertain Podcast episodes?

Katherine: How did you become [00:08:00] Sort of like a spokesperson advocate for SBC bullshit that is happening in this organization. Christa: Well, you know, this was never something that I foresaw or planned on. But, you know, in my own life when my daughter reached the same age, Approximately the same age I had been at the time of the abuse. It just shifted everything it was as though I suddenly saw everything through new eyes and very different eyes. And at that point in time, I was still pretty naive and I thought, Oh gee whiz, if I just talk to church leaders about this, they will surely want to help me. And there\u0027ll be older and wiser. Now they\u0027ll want to make sure that this man can\u0027t hurt anyone else. Yeah. And, of course, I\u0027ve never been more wrong about anything in my life. That was not what happened. But as a mother, I just could not accept that. I mean, going to, you know, a [00:09:00] couple dozen Southern Baptist leaders trying to get someone to help with this, and finding absolutely no one. Yeah. Even though my story was, you know, Corroborated and documented. That was just something that I could not accept and still can\u0027t. And then when I wrote my first op ed for the Dallas Morning News, and this is as far back as 2006. I thought, okay, I\u0027m just going to say my piece here and get it out there. And then I could walk away from all this and never mess with it. But, but what happened was, you know, my email was at the bottom of that op ed piece and and I was just flooded. And so then I, yeah. And then I realized, oh my God, yeah. And I could not, and I just kind of. I\u0027ve been in this ever since. So here I am still. Yeah, Katherine: absolutely. Tell me a little bit about I, I love the letter that you write of just like this perspective [00:10:00] Just because there\u0027s no hope for the church doesn\u0027t mean there\u0027s no hope. Tell me a little bit about that and how that motivates you to sort of keep telling this story and keep saying stuff needs to change. Christa: Well, it has always, I think, in very large measure been The stories of other survivors that has motivated me and I can\u0027t tell all of those stories. I, that I can tell my own story and hope that that helps others in the process and hope that it reveals something of the patterns of what happens in these dreadful dynamics. And so the book ends with a letter that I wrote to clergy sex abuse survivors survivors. And, you know, at this point in time, I\u0027ve kind of been in this for about 20 years, and I do not hold hope, certainly not for the Southern Baptist Convention for, for true, meaningful reform. No, they\u0027ve had countless opportunities to reckon with this, and that\u0027s not what they\u0027re doing. But that doesn\u0027t [00:11:00] mean there is no hope, because I think in every life. When someone reaches the point that they can begin to look at what was done to them, and even speak it to themselves. Or to close friends what was done and speak the truth of what was done, that that is hopeful for that person\u0027s life. Because it is, it is the truth that carries us forward. And that brings transformation in our own lives. And that\u0027s a very hopeful thing. And so I do hold hope for that. And that\u0027s why I keep doing what I do, because I do think that truth holds power as a moral force in the universe. And even, you know, even whatever the Southern Baptist Convention ever does or doesn\u0027t do. We still stand in the truth and that truth is what holds power for us. Katherine: Yeah, the truth alone itself is important and some reason for hope I resonated with that a lot. I [00:12:00] think for the first few years that Tears of Eden existed and the podcast existed. I was kind of focused on like speaking to the church. Like you need to do better. You need to stop doing this. You need to do better. And then quickly lost steam. I was like, it\u0027s not, it\u0027s like one story after another, after another, after another. People having very similar experiences to you. Going to the leadership, going through all the quote unquote right channels to like try and address it and getting shut down, getting re traumatized, re abused. And it\u0027s like, and even now just the climate of the church, the institutional church across all denominations, it\u0027s like they\u0027re digging in and it\u0027s like they\u0027re just digging in. They\u0027re, they\u0027re, they\u0027re, they\u0027re not, there\u0027s not even an opening really for any kind of change or reform. It\u0027s like they\u0027re just, they\u0027re kind of circling the wagons and like making this even, you know, more strong stance. And so [00:13:00] turning to shifting to, I\u0027m not going to try and change this institution. I\u0027m going to talk to the people who have survived was so much more. fulfilling and just like, okay, that institution is going to keep abusing people. And I am going to be here. This organization is going to be here for when those people are needing help. It sucks. It\u0027s not ideal. But I love the way that you describe it as hope, so that this one person individual person collective of people get an opportunity to share their story, and that they are believed somewhere. Massive amount of hope Christa: there. No, I resonate with that totally because I think for me too. In the early years, I sort of viewed myself as speaking truth to power. Mm hmm. I don\u0027t view what I\u0027m doing that way anymore, because the truth is the powerful [00:14:00] already know. Oh, they do. Yes. Oh, they do. They already know. Absolutely. . so nowadays, I think what I\u0027m really doing is just speaking truth. With and for the powerless. It is solidarity with them. Yeah, Katherine: Absolutely. And I, I have stopped calling them are very recently stopped calling them power holders and call them power hoarders because they are just conglomerating and, and not. this is not an accident that they\u0027re in these places. Like they\u0027re intentionally seeking and using a platform of religion and God to get to these places. I saw that thread in your book. Do you, I mean, I\u0027m assuming that that was intentional of this thread of, People intentionally using God in the Bible to get to these places. Tell me about that, if that was intentional and what patterns you\u0027ve seen of [00:15:00] just these type of predators actually intentionally using God in the Bible and the church institution to get these places of power. Christa: Yes. I\u0027m glad you saw that because of course that was intentional because that is what\u0027s happening. And I think you see that in the book. Both on a micro level and on a macro level. It replicates at the macro level. On the micro level, you see it in the way, of course, that Bible verses and Scripture and the whole power of the faith. It is used literally as a weapon for child rape. at the macro level though, in this day and time, we are very much, I think, seeing something quite similar in the way that biblical perspective is essentially being used very often as a propaganda tool for maintaining status quo power. Yeah. And essentially using evangelical theology to legitimize authoritarianism. Mm hmm. And I [00:16:00] think those are kind of the same thing there. Using faith as a tool and a weapon for domination and control. Mm hmm. Katherine: Speak to the person who thinks that they can address the abuse in the church without addressing the theology. Christa: You know, I do not think you can do this without addressing the theology, without interrogating The theology that we see in, in a very broad swath of evangelicalism is a theology of male headship and female submissiveness teaching that men should be in charge and have authority over women and of course also over children. And that Women, females should submit and even that they should graciously submit. And when you have a theology that teaches that some [00:17:00] people by virtue of nothing more than how they are born should be people who have others in authority over them. That is a theology that lends itself, I think, to abuse. And when you combine that theology with an institutional structure that is wholly lacking in accountability systems, then what you\u0027ve done is you\u0027ve created this Frankenstein monster. That just inflicts enormous harm on so many people. And this theology, it\u0027s not as if they simply teach that this is the way it should be. They\u0027re teaching that this is the way God says it should be. And that is incredibly powerful. And I do not think that this that you can solve this without interrogating seriously that theology itself. Katherine: Absolutely. I\u0027m going to [00:18:00] ask you another question because I know what the critics are going to say. Hopefully they are not listening to my podcast anymore, but just in case, what about the teaching to the main tenant of complementarianism is that men and women are equal, but they just have different roles. What do you say to that? Christa: Well, I think it\u0027s the same thing that we saw in Southern Baptist theology with their, I mean, with their, the way they addressed race. And I mean, this began as an institution that was founded for the very purpose of having slaveholding missionaries. It was founded as an institution that sanctified slavery, that consecrated the confederacy, and gave birth to a bloody civil war. This is the Southern Baptist Convention. That is their very roots, [00:19:00] and those roots are still there. And that, the same theology, That derives from those roots saying that white people should have authority over black people is now the very same theology they\u0027re using to say that white men or all men should have authority over all females, they can use that word equal all they want, but separate but equal is never equal. Katherine: Yeah, Christa: it\u0027s not. Katherine: Yes. No, I love that you compared it to that, that slogan of separate but equal. Like, if there is something distinctly about your person that is causing the separation, it\u0027s not equality. It\u0027s, it\u0027s just not. You can use that word. It is not true. It\u0027s just, yeah, it\u0027s not. Yes. I saw in your bio that you\u0027re a lawyer or used to be a lawyer. [00:20:00] I\u0027m a retired attorney. Yes. Retired attorney. What was your And what has been your approach to this from like a legal perspective and like what you think needs to happen legally? Christa: Well you know, I, I\u0027m a retired attorney, so I don\u0027t give legal advice. But certainly I think my background has helped shape how I think about these things. Or You know I do think that the Southern Baptist Convention has shown that it has no interest, not really, in seriously reckoning with this problem. And the only thing that will bring change in this massive, cantacular, multi billion dollar institution is outside pressure. And that outside pressure comes from lawsuits, civil lawsuits, criminal prosecutions independent investigations and from the media and so, you know, there, there are a lot of problems with bringing civil lawsuits, [00:21:00] particularly here in the south there are a lot of states that have very archaic statutes of limitation that, that impede the bringing of lawsuits. But I believe that will change over time. I, I hold faith. In the dog Katherine: statue of limitation all together across the board. Just Christa: yeah, and I hold faith that that will eventually happen. I think the trend is going that way and I think America\u0027s trial lawyers are pushing and I have a lot of faith in America\u0027s trial lawyers. Yeah, it won\u0027t happen in my lifetime, but this is the way it\u0027s going. Katherine: Right. Yeah, and I think that that\u0027s helpful just kind of clarity for folks who are still relying on bringing in, you know, People to come in and try and do, you know, counseling and try and do, you know, organizational training or coaching or whatever within the institution, the same power power hoarders within that institution [00:22:00] are still controlling. Even that, like it has to come from outside to make any, if there is going to be any change. Christa: It does. And I am so grateful also, just want to say here to so many fine journalists who have done enormous work over the past couple decades. We would know so much less. Yeah, about the dynamics of how they hold this power, were it not for the work of dedicated journalists Katherine: and authors like yourself Christa: are Katherine: also for the Christa: courage and an outspokenness of so many survivors who stepped outside. The arena and went to the outside and spoke the truth of their stories. Yeah, Katherine: absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, just for folks who since you do have, you know, the attorney experience. I know a big fear for a lot of folks and I don\u0027t know how litigious the SBC is. I\u0027m [00:23:00] familiar with some denominations that are very litigious. That fear of speaking their own story and then getting having being sued for like defamation or slander. Have you seen any patterns or anything that is helpful in that type of situation? Christa: I think that risk, of course, is there and the Southern Baptist Convention has certainly shown that it will use scorched earth litigation tactics against survivors. We certainly saw that it finally came to light in the case involving Paul Pressler where it came to light that they actually had emails among themselves where they showed that they knew that his allegations had serious corroboration and despite that for six years They tried every means possible against him in the litigation process. We\u0027ve seen it in the litigation involving another woman [00:24:00] in Kentucky. And I think, of course, what we see in this is, is really where their heart is. They aren\u0027t trying to do right by survivors, they\u0027re trying to squash survivors every way they can. And, and I know there\u0027s, there\u0027s a lot of us who were raised in this, in evangelicalism and broad swaths of it that teach that, you know, believers shouldn\u0027t sue other believers. You know what? Get past that. Get past that and get yourself a good lawyer. Get over it. Get past that and go talk to a good lawyer. And maybe there\u0027s some, the legal system isn\u0027t perfect. And sometimes, given the passage of time and all sorts of factors, there may not be good legal recourse. But it is always worth at least consulting with a good sexual abuse attorney about your options. Katherine: Yeah. And at least know, at least know what they are. And then there are ways I think also to just like go public about your story. It\u0027s so hard when you are the, [00:25:00] the survivor. And so like you are telling your version of the story. But I think that there are ways to like tell the story too. And so like talking to journalists and stuff too, like how to, how do I phrase this so that. They\u0027re going to still come after you, even if you do all of potentially all of the things right that anyone can sue anyone for any reason. But yeah, there are, there are things that we can do to, to protect ourselves. Right. With a time that we have left I would love to hear just maybe just like your, you would, what wanna say to survivors and people who are reading your book. What do you want people to take away when they read the book, Christa: you know, to survivors? I say, first of all, you know, the, the very, it is the very nature I think, of sexual abuse that it inculcates in this. this idea that we don\u0027t hold any value. And that\u0027s a lie. That is a lie. You are all, each and every one of you, [00:26:00] are human beings of infinite worth. And the lie that the abuse has inculcated and the continuing lie that faith leaders inculcate by their do nothing reactions as though it\u0027s no big deal. All of that, all of that is a lie. So I say that to you. And at the same time, I would also say, you know, it\u0027s hard to do, but cultivate your skepticism. And I think that\u0027s really important. And don\u0027t feel guilty skepticism. They have not earned your trust, not one bit. So cultivate your skepticism and that skepticism, and when we see that faith itself, is being weaponized both to commit abuse and to silence survivors, then it behooves us to cultivate skepticism even as to [00:27:00] matters of faith. Sure. Katherine: Absolutely. No, and I appreciate, I appreciate you saying that because I think it\u0027s so easy for folks to just say, but then don\u0027t give up on God and then don\u0027t give up on the church and, and that can just kind of. Defeat everything that comes before that. Yes. And like that avenue of maybe this has done so much to destroy trust that it\u0027s no longer worthy of me investing and putting my time and my, my heart and my faith into this that, that, that is a legitimate option for people. And guilt free. Yes, absolutely. Christa: That is a Katherine: legitimate path. Christa: Yes, give yourself that freedom and focus on yourself and your own healing and make that the priority and let faith fall where it falls. Katherine: Yeah. Christa: But focus on yourself. Katherine: Yeah, absolutely. [00:28:00] Absolutely. Yeah. And that, that, that being so counter to the theology that we were raised with of just like surrender. I love the part in your book where you\u0027re just talking about that all to Jesus. I just surrender him that we all saying. And it was like, it\u0027s like an embedded into everything to just divorce yourself from yourself and to like give up everything. And that. When you are doing that, you, you become this ripe victim for for predators because, because there is nothing, no personal internal radar that you are able to pay attention to that you\u0027re, you\u0027re discouraged from paying attention to it. In, in the, in these spaces because of this theology. And I 100 percent agree with you. It is worthy of. Christa: All right, because what we\u0027ve been taught is our bodies are not our own, our lives are not our own. Our lives are for the service of God, [00:29:00] which often means the service of these men who tell us about God. Well, we gotta let that go. Katherine: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Long journey, long journey to get there, but absolutely 100 percent worth it. This was great. This was awesome. This is wonderful. Where can people find you? How can they follow you? How can they interact with you? Christa: Well, I\u0027m very active on Twitter. I\u0027m Krista Brown, 777. I also have a Substack newsletter, which is kristabrown. substack. com. Those are probably the two best places. All Katherine: right, I will put that stuff in the show notes. Uncertain is produced, recorded, edited, and hosted by me, Katherine Spearing.

It\u0027s so good to be here. Thank you for having me, Catherine. I\u0027m excited to talk about your new book, book five, where you\u0027re on twisting scriptures about brokenness and suffering. Yes, Rebecca: book five and the untwisting scripture series. My daughter asked me how many books in this series I was going to write. I said, I do not know. I\u0027m going to keep going. [00:01:00] Katherine: Keeps coming up. I\u0027m excited about this one. Because, well, I\u0027m excited about all of them. I think they\u0027re all really important, but this one, I think the teaching about brokenness and suffering in the church. will often keep people in abusive situations and keep them recognizing that. And so this is really important, really, really important. And so we had another interview with you when your book four came out and so I\u0027m going to link that in the show notes so folks have That to listen to as well, but to just get us started, I would love to hear what fuels your passion for writing these books. Rebecca: Oh boy. That\u0027s a really, really good question. For one thing, when I first got started, the first untwisting scriptures book came out in 2016 and then it was about four years before I really got the series rolling, which is not a great way to do a series, but anyway, that\u0027s what happened. But my first initial [00:02:00] passion was. I hated, hated seeing how God, and this was all new to me 10 years ago, seeing how God was being represented as an abuser. And it wasn\u0027t that I\u0027d never heard the teachings. It\u0027s because I didn\u0027t grow up with abuse. I didn\u0027t marry into abuse. I hadn\u0027t been subject to the abuse, so I didn\u0027t see. I was just blind. To how the logical conclusion of these teachings, where that logical conclusion would go, because it was all theory to me, it hadn\u0027t been worked out in practice, but then when I saw when I heard people coming to me about this and saying, well, I was taught you have to give up all your rights was thinking, you know, kind of remember that somewhere. Well, I\u0027d been to the Bill Gothard seminars that taught about giving up your rights many years before, but I hadn\u0027t, and I thought at the time, you know, I just believed everything he said, but there wasn\u0027t ever in my life, ever a time when my rights weren\u0027t acknowledged. [00:03:00] And just like part of the air I breathed because I was not in abuse. So then I see when people who are in abuse are being told, give up your rights. I see. Starting in 2012, the logical conclusion this is coming to, that they are going to be absolutely trampled on. And I\u0027m, I\u0027m astonished and appalled at what\u0027s happening to these people. And then the next step is I\u0027m astonished and appalled that God is being represented this way. They think this is what God wants to do. And so that was my initial passion fueling me. Now I\u0027m seeing it actually in the Bible who God really is, that he is not how these people have represented him. Katherine: Yeah, and and folks are able to determine what that looks like for them and what their beliefs look like for them and not base those beliefs on abusive people who\u0027ve been teaching [00:04:00] them these abusive messages. And that\u0027s I feel like that\u0027s really important for me for folks to create their own journey and not base it on because so many things I think in the church are just either tradition. Or really harmful things that have been taught to us by. Yes, Rebecca: like listen to authority. You someone wrote to me and said yours that she was taught. I\u0027m supposed to lead and feed and you\u0027re supposed to follow and swallow. I think that\u0027s how it went. Oh, my God. I thought I had never heard that one reaction to that. So that\u0027s that. That could be so many things. And yet that is so it\u0027s like, I was I was feeling some some, some strong emotions in response to that. But it\u0027s that authority teaching. Turn your brain off. Turn your brain off. Do not think. If you think, then you\u0027ve been ungodly or something. You just have to believe me, the [00:05:00] leader, and follow me. Whereas, I\u0027ve always believed since I was young and want to encourage other people. Go to the Bible yourself. Look at it yourself. Let\u0027s examine everything Untwisting Scriptures books. Go look at it yourself and see what the Bible is really teaching. Katherine: And be prepared for where that may lead, depending on the environment that you\u0027re in. Rebecca: Yes. And I hope I hope my hope is that it will lead to seeing that God really is a God who loves his people and wants to be with his people. And one of the best representations in the scriptures, I mean, there are many good ones, but one of the best is that father who\u0027s running out to the prodigal son and embracing him and bringing him in and Even wanting to have a relationship with his older son, who\u0027s, who\u0027s unhappy. Let\u0027s, I\u0027ll just put it that way, very unhappy. He wants, he wants relationship. He is a God of relationship. And the more I research the [00:06:00] topic, the untwisting scriptures, the more I see that in my study. God is a God of relationship with his people, healthy, Good relationship, not abusive relationship, not just, just obey me and stop whining, those are all things that are, I\u0027m very, very passionate about. Katherine: So , book five, Brokenness and Suffering, what are some of the questions that you\u0027re seeking to answer with this? Rebecca: Yes, well, initially when I started this book, it was going to be called, suffering, dying to self and life. And then I started finding I realized, Oh, my goodness, I need to talk about brokenness. That\u0027s a huge thing. And then that expanded and expanded. And I realized, dying to self and life, you\u0027re gonna have to wait for a future book, I just have to focus on these two things for this book. And that\u0027s enough. And when I did start the study of brokenness, which I started, there were two things. One was prompting it. I\u0027ve been [00:07:00] hearing about brokenness and how we\u0027re all broken or we\u0027re all supposed to be broken or, or brokenness is, is either godly or it\u0027s inevitable. We\u0027re just, everybody\u0027s broken or something. I was thinking something is off, something is off about all this teaching. And there were two things. That prompted my research for the brokenness section of this book, which leads into the suffering section. And one of them was a woman who wrote to me about all the triggering songs in church that talked about God in an abusive way. And at the time I thought, well, I didn\u0027t like some of these songs, but other ones of them I didn\u0027t either I didn\u0027t know or I didn\u0027t notice. And she was talking about how, how it says how different songs will say things like, crash into Me. It doesn\u0027t say destroy me, but it\u0027s almost like it says Destroy me. Mm-Hmm. , like, like completely o overcome me. And Until You, until I\u0027m nothing. Me. [00:08:00] I think that\u0027s consume me. That\u0027s the one, that\u0027s the one consume me. And when I looked at it through her eyes. I thought, Oh my word, that\u0027s right. That\u0027s exactly what this says. I am ready to be basically destroyed by God. This, the Bible never speaks that way ever actually. So I think these songs are really problematic as much as some Christians might like these songs and reinterpret the songs in their heads. I think that the, the songs don\u0027t represent. how the Bible speaks about our God with his people. So then and the other thing I said, there were two things. One of them was this, that woman writing to me about the songs. And the other one was a very popular sermon given by Nancy Lita Moss back in the nineties. And it was, From what I could tell the beginning of her rise in fame. Now she would have already been rising in fame. She was from a very wealthy family was very well connected. but this, [00:09:00] this was at Moody and Moody Bible Institute. she gave a sermon about how everybody needed to be broken. And she\u0027s given that sermon again, like in recent days, that was 95 ish. And this, the most recent ones was 2016 and that I could find anyway. And the message was basically the same. I thought, did she change? Did she modify? But no, they\u0027re basically the same message. So I, I took a chapter to talk about the brokenness teachings. like in the songs and what the Bible says about brokenness. And so I thought, all right, this is what I do. Since I\u0027m in untwisting scriptures, I go through every Bible reference to this concept. And I thought, I will, I probably won\u0027t find that much because You know, there just aren\u0027t that many references to brokenness in the Bible, but I was really surprised at how much I found about brokenness or breaking in the Bible. And the references were, I mean, it just delighted my [00:10:00] heart. The references were to God, how God breaks the wicked and, and it\u0027s really important for us. to understand that not everyone is the wicked. Do you see what I\u0027m saying? Because in book four, and I had to reference back to book four to distinguish the righteous from the wicked, the wicked are the ones whose hearts are set against God. Even if, even if they present really well, even if they present as a godly person. And this is what the Bible calls wolves and sheep\u0027s clothing, which is why the subtitle of book four is wolves, hypocrisy, sin leveling, and righteousness. Sin leveling is treating all sins as equal. A very important concept to understand when you\u0027re going to recognize in the Bible, God breaks the wicked. To think, wait a minute, I love Jesus, I\u0027m following Jesus. I don\u0027t have a heart of hypocrisy as [00:11:00] defined in the Bible, which I outlined very clearly in book four. I don\u0027t have that kind of heart. So that means I\u0027m not one of those wicked and I\u0027m not a person who\u0027s that God is going to break. Now, maybe somebody else is breaking me, but it won\u0027t be God. You see what I\u0027m saying? Now, there was also the case of Psalm 51, very common verse. David refers to the bones that you have broken being able to rejoice it. So I dig into that Let\u0027s look at Psalm 51 because I saw in the scriptures. God breaks the wicked and God breaks the hard hearted believer who needs to be David Rebecca: needs something deep to happen to them in order to get them to come back to the Lord. So those are the only two things I saw the wicked, like in, in judgment, like judgment day and any other judgment the Lord brings. And the hard hearted believer, David was [00:12:00] hard hearted. He was so hard. Hard. All right. Background to Psalm 51. It\u0027s the, the repentance mourning confession Psalm after Nathan, the prophet came into David and told him you are the one who has stolen somebody else\u0027s pet lamb and destroyed it. So it was in reference to his, his abuse, sexual assault of Bathsheba and the We might say indirect murder of her husband and so broken is needed to happen. Exactly. Exactly. When David committed adultery, or I might say committed sexual abuse, rape of Beth Sheba, he could have repented. Then he could have repented at any time. He could have turned back to the Lord at any point, but when he, when you see that, not only when she told him, I, I\u0027m going to have a baby. When he, he, he didn\u0027t. Like come before the Lord in weeping and mourning at that time. [00:13:00] He said, okay, I better get her husband out of the way that shows hard heartedness When someone is hard hearted God does knee I would say I would pray for God to do some breaking of that person to break their hearts over their sin That\u0027s what happened to David That is a very specific psalm about, about a very specific situation that would apply to people if they are hard hearted. I don\u0027t like all of us, the ones who love Jesus and are following Him and want to do His will and are desperate to do His will, praying that. Because it doesn\u0027t apply to us. One of my points in my books, all the way through the books is that not all scripture applies to us. We can learn from all of it, but we don\u0027t take all of it and say, this is about me. That just isn\u0027t, it\u0027s, it\u0027s one of the foundational hermeneutical principles that I follow when I work on my untwisting scriptures books. They don\u0027t all apply to [00:14:00] every Katherine: context. That\u0027s right. That\u0027s right. Rebecca: Yes. So then that\u0027s that chapter, and I talk about Nancy Liedemaus sermon and the examples that she uses of brokenness. that either don\u0027t apply or don\u0027t even make sense. So I do want to point out illogic when, when people are illogical, because illogic happens a lot. And when it\u0027s just in a flow, in a flow of things, people might not notice. There\u0027s illogic going on because for one thing, they\u0027re taught to turn off their brains when they\u0027re hearing a sermon. And that\u0027s what I did back in my Bill Gothard days. I just received, received, received. And it was years later that I looked at it and thought, Oh my word, this stuff is terrible. Katherine: Yeah. Rebecca: That I did not see it at the time. I will excuse myself because I was very young, but it was still really wrong and I should have been paying attention and listening. Katherine: I agree with the logic thing. And I think that logic has been a huge part of my story, even when I was young [00:15:00] and. All the way up into my mid twenties, my main abuser, spiritual abuser teaching these things. And then also teaching us that we need to know our Bible and go and read your Bible. And then I would read the Bible and I would see something different than what they were teaching. And then I would talk to them about it. And then they would tell me that I was wrong. And it was, and the logic of like, that why do you get to be the one if like god is the authority that we\u0027re listening to and the bible is what we\u0027re supposed to be paying attention to and i come to a different conclusion to you than you why do you get to be the one that decides and i think I believe this person has a lot of different personality disorders because I really believe that they didn\u0027t think it was possible for someone to think differently than them. I think they were so completely flabbergasted. They thought they were so right. And then if everyone [00:16:00] studied the way they studied, then everyone would come to their same conclusion about it. And there was no space for like, nuance, context, the fact that it didn\u0027t apply to you and, and just, again, like, the logic of the situation being a massive factor for me to like, wake up to those, you know, Wake up to some of the stuff that was happening and like, this actually is just doesn\u0027t make sense, you Rebecca: know, and you are exceptional that way, because you were actually asking questions. So many people when they go to the Bible, if they see something, or if their logic, or the Holy Spirit leads them to a different conclusion from what they\u0027ve been taught. Many, many people will just shut that part out, shut it out, shut it out, because that\u0027s heresy if I believe something different from my leader. And then for [00:17:00] many people, they\u0027ll listen to audios of their leader more than they\u0027ll listen to the Bible. They\u0027ll read things written by their leader more than they\u0027ll read the Bible. Yeah. But the fact is that there are certain aspects of biblical doctrine that people have been disagreeing on. Like for hundreds and thousands of years. It\u0027s so true. We\u0027re not going to suddenly figure it out. So that\u0027s where we say we can, we can have, you know, there are just a very few basics that you agree on to call yourself a Christian. And like, I believe as a, as a Christian. And when I use that word, I want to use it in the way the book of acts uses it rather than the way it\u0027s used nowadays. When I call myself a Christian, I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as my savior. And there are really very few things that will keep me [00:18:00] from fellowshipping or having a camaraderie, let\u0027s say, instead of that other word with other people who disagree with me on a lot of different things. So it\u0027s just. I\u0027m so glad you were able to see that. But it really, it\u0027s astonishing when you step back and look, this sounds like the way a cult operates. You have to agree with the leader. Katherine: Absolutely. Absolutely. And I think that they would discourage you from reading the Bible if more people were doing that. And then like what is the Christian scientists? Mary Baker Eddy\u0027s book is used to interpret the Bible, so they would, like, tell you very specifically, like, this is what this means. So you read it, but you have to have it accompanied with this other voice. So there\u0027s a Rebecca: certain filter. Here\u0027s the filter that you have to put over the Bible when you read it. And if you read it without that filter, then you\u0027re in deep, [00:19:00] dark trouble. And you might be headed for hell, you know, so it\u0027s that way following your own ways. Yes. Yes. And your own what your own heart is what deceitful above all things, right? That is in that\u0027s in one of my untwisting scriptures books. I don\u0027t know Katherine: what that verse means. Exactly. That\u0027s a very common, commonly Misused and abused scripture. Yes, it\u0027s Rebecca: used like an attack rocket, you know, we\u0027re gonna, we\u0027re gonna mow you down with this one. It\u0027s really easy to just be like, well, your heart is deceitful. That\u0027s right. It took me Katherine: a long while to be like, why do you get to say that? Rebecca: That\u0027s right. Because doesn\u0027t that mean your heart is deceitful too? Your heart is deceitful too? Which one\u0027s Rebecca: more? That\u0027s right. That\u0027s right. And, and it is. It\u0027s it can be so difficult for people coming out of these super authoritarian structures to recognize. Hey, I have the Holy Spirit too. I can, I can listen to the Lord [00:20:00] too. I can read the Bible too. What if I come to a different conclusion about certain things? Does that mean that I\u0027m, that the Lord is going to reject me because I wasn\u0027t listening to my authority? Or does it mean? My authority and I are actually my my so called authority and I are actually on the same level ground that we both get to read the Bible and and seek the Lord and ask the Lord what he means. And maybe we can read other people. I hope some people will read my books, of course, but I never want my books to supersede or be a filter through which you read the scriptures. Read the scriptures and ask the Holy Spirit what they mean. Ask him to help you connect scripture with scripture. I pass on, What I\u0027ve learned, but I want everybody to dig in for themselves. And if you come to a different conclusion, I will say, I hope we can still be friends, you know? Katherine: Oh yeah, exactly. Exactly. I think that that\u0027s that\u0027s, [00:21:00] that\u0027s really great to just hold, hold that space for differences of opinions and not being, and as you said, just like the, Evidence of a cult leader being super dogmatic that this is the way that it exists, but it\u0027s so powerful, especially if you\u0027re raised in it, like that you can\u0027t trust yourself. And especially if that\u0027s assigned to something like, because you\u0027re a child, you can\u0027t, you have to trust the adults or because you are a teenager or because you are in your 20s or because you are a woman or any of these other. Things that are intrinsic to us that then make us untrustworthy to be able to read scripture and interpret it. It\u0027s really powerful, really difficult. Absolutely. Rebecca: And, and the environment a child is raised in is huge. A lot of the people who write to me are, you know, People who were raised in in the spiritually abusive environments [00:22:00] that we might call cults. Yes that They\u0027re trying to break out of and there are patterns in their mind That they can be changed. I love how new brain science is showing that new patterns can be formed in the brain. Whereas before they used to talk about the brain, like it was cement and you couldn\u0027t do anything about it, but definitely new patterns can be formed. And I do have a free a free guide on my website. Here\u0027s the joy. com. That\u0027s called how to enjoy the Bible again, after spiritual abuse, how to enjoy the Bible again, when you\u0027re ready after spiritual abuse without feeling guilty or getting triggered out of your mind. Because a lot of people say, when I try to read the Bible, I hear it in my abuser\u0027s voice. Yep. And I don\u0027t know how to break out of that. It is possible. It is possible to break out of that, but it can be. a road. It can be a dream. Sure. Katherine: Yeah. And that was true for me for probably [00:23:00] seven, eight years reading the Bible. And like, I cannot get the interpretation of, you know, this person out of my head. And I mean, that\u0027s trauma. It\u0027s trauma. It\u0027s a trauma bond. It\u0027s a, yes, absolutely. It\u0027s very, very deep. Rebecca: . And understanding those things, I think understanding the, the way the brain works, the mind and brain system. As well as understanding spiritual abuse and then wanting to understand the Bible. I think all of those things need to work together. I think it\u0027s good for, for us to have a deeper understanding. I have something, this is off the subject of book five, but I\u0027m going to tell you this. On my website, heresthejoy. com, I have a statement of beliefs, my statement of beliefs. And one of the sections is called the sufficiency of scripture. And in that section I say I believe the scripture is sufficient to show us who God is, how our salvation is accomplished, what he wants from us, and, and how we can relate to him, blah, blah, blah.[00:24:00] But I believe the scripture is not sufficient, and was never intended to be sufficient, to tell us all the ways abuse can be executed on people off the way the brain works in trauma and several other things I list there. The script that isn\u0027t what the scripture is about. Yeah. So for us to look to brain science or some tools that people use, like, oh, say EMDR, maybe because of how the brain works, isn\u0027t going against the Bible. That isn\u0027t what the Bible\u0027s about. It can actually be a tool Those things, some of those brainy things can be tools to help us regulate better so that we can come back to the scriptures and look at them fresh and see more clearly after spiritual abuse who God really is, who we really are, and how the world operates, how salvation is accomplished, all of those things. They can be extremely [00:25:00] helpful. Katherine: , I remember my main abuser saying the Bible is good enough for everything. It is, is, it is, I don\u0027t know if they were use the word sufficient, but like it, it like it is the only book that you need which is so It\u0027s so discombobulated when absolutely, Rebecca: It is the revelation of God to man about God, about salvation. You know, we can learn about God from nature. We can learn a lot about God from nature, but to understand his plan of salvation, that\u0027s in the Bible. But there are other things, like the Bible does not address those things, and it never intended to address those things. So we\u0027ve got to get outside of the book. The box of the Bible is sufficient for everything. I, I, I find it so funny and ironic and hypocritical that Jay Adams, the founder of Newthetic, so called biblical counseling. I know all these people. I know all these people. Wrote like a hundred books telling you that the Bible is the [00:26:00] only book you need, Katherine: you\u0027re right, that is so ironic. But read my book to tell you that. Rebecca: That\u0027s right, you\u0027ve got to read my books. But, but I will go back and say the Bible is the only book you need. Anyway, it doesn\u0027t make any sense at all. Yeah, that is Katherine: your absolute logic. Logic here, right? There you go. There\u0027s the logic.

Katherine: What are some of the responses that you have received to this particular book? Rebecca: I get responses. To all my books, pretty often, like some people have just discovered the series and they\u0027re reading the whole series and last summer I sent this one brokenness and suffering out to my beta readers, and then my book launch team, and I got a lot of bit strong responses from them about [00:27:00] how, you know, some of them have read all of my books and they, and they think maybe they\u0027re all done untwisting all the, all the things. And they read the next one and they go, Oh my word, there were all these things too. So, so I do often get responses like this was extremely helpful and it has been very freeing to me. Freeing is one of the. One of the most common words I get, and of course, if you\u0027re all tangled up, the, the, the subtitle of my earlier books was Untwisting Scriptures that have been used to tie you up. gag you and tangle your mind. So if those things are being undone, then of course you\u0027re going to feel free. I think some church leaders feel afraid of the concept of people getting free because then they maybe they think, oh, then they\u0027ll They\u0027ll be free to sin. Well, you know, the New Testament talks a good bit about freedom, and it\u0027s not freedom to sin.[00:28:00] It\u0027s freedom in Jesus Christ to actually know him, that\u0027s when I pound over and over. I pound on that because that was so free to me 20 years ago when I first understood it, that I wanted other people to know it. All of our righteousness is in Jesus Christ alone, not in the hoops we jump through, not in the list we keep, not in the ways we make ourselves smaller and smaller. Smaller and more and more invisible and more and more ready to be kicked and punched and beaten down. Not any of that. It is all in Jesus Christ alone. So I do emphasize in this book the importance of understanding that God is not the one, except in those two cases, the wicked and the hard hearted believer. He\u0027s not the one who inflicts. This broken, this breaking, he\u0027s not the one who [00:29:00] inflicts the, the abuse and a common saying, I guess, in Christendom is we are all broken. And I\u0027ve never really liked that one because I thought, how can we all. always be broken. Does God, does God not ever heal? Does he never heal brokenness? I can understand being broken because there are abusers and, and there are people who break and shatter people who, I mean, there\u0027s some people who are really, really beaten down. Isn\u0027t God the healer? So why are we going to keep on saying that we\u0027re all broken? Can we go to him for healing? Does he heal? That\u0027s one of the questions I wanted to grapple with. And Jesus says right there in the scriptures that he has come to heal the brokenhearted and to set the captives free. So I don\u0027t think it\u0027s scriptural to say we\u0027re all broken all the time, [00:30:00] forever and ever. We can say, actually, he\u0027s healed me. Now, I want people to be honest if they still feel shattered if they still feel broken, then definitely. Let\u0027s let\u0027s Do what needs to be done, not deny that feeling exactly. We don\u0027t want to just deny that, but Rebecca: we do want to see that healing is possible down the road and coming to the Lord is not an identity Katherine: that we have to embrace. That\u0027s Rebecca: right. And there is another thing I addressed in that book two chapters on it, the victim mentality, because it was really bothering me a lot that people were being accused of having a victim mentality. When, familiar with that one, when they want to get help, when they want to warn other people when they need to process their trauma. I mean, when they express that they don\u0027t like something. Yes. Like, Oh, you\u0027re just stuck in the past. You just have your victim mentality. [00:31:00] Get out of that. And I think, so what is a victim mentality really? So I do think it\u0027s possible to have a victim mentality, but the only. way I saw it as being a real thing is when a person accuses everybody else of always being the problem. Like everybody else is always taking advantage of me. I lost my last, I got fired from my last 10 jobs, but it was always somebody else. It was always the boss. It was always the co worker. And I thought, That sounds more like an abuser than a victim to me, like abusers or, and maybe, maybe not abusers, but people who just aren\u0027t willing to actually look at themselves and see how they need to change. But to accuse someone of this very victim mentality, that term is always negative to accuse someone of having this victim mentality, when really they are just trying to they\u0027re trying to [00:32:00] bring awareness to others of a big problem, like either a problem they need help with or a problem like you\u0027ve got a problem in your church. I\u0027ve heard so often when people are trying to bring awareness about an abuser in the church or lack of safety in the Nursery for example. Yeah. Oh, you\u0027re just you\u0027re you\u0027re just too Stuck in the past because you had childhood trauma yourself. So their own their own ability to see the problems is ignored because They, they\u0027re the canary in the coal mine because they have a greater ability to see the problems. They notice things. Anyway, I\u0027m talking, talking. What do you want to say, Kevin? Katherine: My, my final question is, you know, kind of, we\u0027re talking about it and we\u0027re, we\u0027re talking about it. We\u0027re addressing it, but I would love to hear, are there any specific ways that you have seen this [00:33:00] twisted application of brokenness and suffering, keeping people in abusive systems? And how have you seen that play out? Oh, absolutely. Rebecca: One of the chapters in this book is specifically based on a letter I received from someone, and often blog posts or book chapters are based on answers to letters I\u0027ve received. A woman who was in an abusive marriage for very, very long time, many decades, said it was based on something about something that Puritan had written about suffering, but that\u0027s just one of many. It could have been many, many people writing about suffering and how when we suffer, it\u0027s like the suffering of Jesus. And there can be redemption through our suffering because he brought redemption through his suffering. And so she said, I would even look for ways to suffer. Because I felt like that was going to make me more godly. People say our suffering is going to make us more godly. And so I would look [00:34:00] for ways to suffer. And I would, I don\u0027t think she said she was glad when her abusive husband abused her, but she was sure that that was going to make her more godly. And it took her a very, very long time to understand that that was not the heart of God. And it was right. To get away from suffering at the hands of someone who said, who promised he would love and protect you promised it before a room of witnesses. That\u0027s it\u0027s, it\u0027s so twisted. And I don\u0027t blame the individuals for having the twisted thinking, because it\u0027s what they\u0027ve been taught to think that someone who promises at the wedding ceremony, the wedding vows. Promises to love and protect you and then abuses you that that\u0027s a good thing That is not a good thing and yet so much of the church You you need to stay in that abusive marriage. Of course, they won\u0027t call it abuse. They\u0027ll just call it marriage and [00:35:00] need to stay you need to stay in that marriage and Continue to suffer and god will refine you and he will redeem your marriage and all these wrong teachings That is that keep people in a place of oppression. So it is, and it\u0027s not just marriage. It\u0027s also children under abusive parents and abusing trafficking situations. Yes. The abusive pastor. Yes, absolutely. Well, I should just say church leader because he\u0027s not really a pastor, but self proclaimed leader. That\u0027s right. That\u0027s right. There you go. The It\u0027s part of this is so I see how all the abusive teachings work together and I address lots of abusive teachings in my five books so far, how all of them work together to create this environment this atmosphere, almost like a web, a web around people, you try to push against it and just you just get more and more stuck in the [00:36:00] web. Yeah, and, and all of these different things. These teachings that are not the heart of God and not really what the scripture teaches are pushing against people to try to keep them small, keep them contained, keep them from thinking, keep them from listening to the Holy Spirit, keeping them from being able to escape their abusive situation. So that is my passion to get Katherine: back to the very first question you asked. And what would you, say to someone who does wake up and recognizes I\u0027m, I\u0027m in this abusive system and this teaching is keeping me trapped here. What would be, you know, maybe like a safe exit plan or what are, you know, what are some initials? I Rebecca: actually, I actually don\u0027t do exit plans. I refer them to people who do because that\u0027s not my specialty. And I want to, I want, I am willing to stay. I love it. Yeah, that\u0027s right. I stay in my lane and I\u0027m absolutely willing to [00:37:00] stay connected with people. You know, they can make appointments with me. We can stay connected by email. One person recently wrote and said, I don\u0027t know if you even see this. It might be your assistant who sees it. Well, no, I, I read and answer all my emails, but for actual exit plans, That is, that\u0027s huge. People need to have them. But I have connections of people who are passionate about helping people in that way. And I\u0027m happy to refer them to someone who can do that with them. Katherine: Great. I appreciate that. Well, thank you so, so much. Tell folks where they can find you and find your book. Rebecca: Yes. Here\u0027s the joy. com is my website and you can see all my stuff there and my books. My Untwisting Scriptures book series are all on Amazon. . And I\u0027ve written or co written over 20 books, so I\u0027m well versed in this area and happy to help others. Great. Thank you so much for Katherine: untwisting scriptures. Thank you, Catherine, for having me. I really [00:38:00] appreciate it.

Kate West has a very special place in my heart. We met over the internet in the very early days of Tears of Eden, in the early days of the podcast Uncertain. She was the first person that I encountered outside of my family who\u0027d Similar to the way that I had, who was talking about it openly in public, online, we have been friends and colleagues ever since then. Her book is about that experience of growing up in the Christian patriarchy movement in the stay at home daughter movement. We\u0027ll talk a little bit about the dynamics of that. podcast before. So I\u0027m going to link to some of those episodes in the show notes. She\u0027s also a member of Tears of Eden\u0027s editorial board. and is responsible for a lot of the content that is on the Tears of [00:01:00] Yin blog, the website. Super grateful for her. Very grateful for her story. And here is my interview with Kate West. katherine: Well, hello, Kate. Hello. How are you? I\u0027m doing all right it is good to see you. Cait: You too. And I think we both have sunny days. It seems like you have some sunshine in your room. katherine: Yes. It\u0027s going to be, it\u0027s going to be a relatively warmer weekend. I think like 60s ish. How\u0027s weather where you are? Cait: Yeah, I think it might get up to 60 today. And I want to, I want to get outside and start. Scraping around in the dirt and get my garden started, but we\u0027ll katherine: see. Speaking of dirt, your book. Cait: What a segue. katherine: Your book is called Rift, and you have a metaphor throughout your book about geology. And the earth, you talk a lot about like the earth [00:02:00] and I\u0027m not even going to try to like get into scientific things. So talk to me about your book, which is the full title is rifts, a memoir of breaking away from Christian patriarchy. You have been on the podcast a couple of times before, so I\u0027m going to link to some of those episodes in the show notes. But talk to me about the, the theme of this book and that metaphor, that geological earth metaphor that you use here. Cait: If you\u0027ve listened to other interviews, the other interviews, you\u0027ll know I grew up similar to you, like, as a stay at home daughter, Christian patriarchy movement, quiverful. And this book is a story of me growing up in that and not understanding the world I was living in until it started going wrong and how I figured out how to leave and my life afterwards. And the idea of rifting comes from [00:03:00] this idea in, Well, there\u0027s this interesting thing that happens in geology where the earth splits apart and something like continents can be caused by rifts. You might think of like, there\u0027s this big rift in Africa where you can see the rift valley. And where I live in Michigan, rift, a rift started the great lakes. That\u0027s, we\u0027re surrounded by water in Michigan. And that\u0027s, that\u0027s partly why I talk about rifting is because I\u0027m surrounded by water and I\u0027m fascinated by this idea of, Breaking away because when I left patriarchy, I, I wanted to start over, start with a clean slate and never have to think about my past again. And so I wanted to break away, right? But, but I couldn\u0027t escape who I am and where I came from. No matter what I tried, it, it kept coming back. And I feel like that trauma is stored in your body and you just can\u0027t. Move on without healing from that. So the idea of a rift is both sides of it [00:04:00] are the same materials, you know, the same ground, but over time they change. in separate ways. So I\u0027ve, I\u0027ve moved on from the Christian patriarchy movement. There\u0027s still part of me that is because of what happened to me, but I\u0027m changing now and I\u0027m separated from it in a way that allows me to grow. So that\u0027s just like a bigger metaphor I\u0027m using throughout the book. It helps me to think bigger picture instead of focusing in on my own story all the time. It\u0027s, it\u0027s kind of like a grounding practice. katherine: Oh, for sure. And it\u0027s a perfect metaphor too, because the new space or the new geological formation, Comes from the old and it\u0027s still the same earth, but it\u0027s a, it\u0027s completely new thing. And it\u0027s perfect. And I\u0027ve been thinking about that so much lately, because I think we all have this leaning of [00:05:00] like, of wanting to have a before and an after, and like, I went through this, but then I healed and now I\u0027m better. And here I am. And this, the reality is. We are impacted forever. Especially something as traumatic as what you went through as what I went through impacted our very identities impacted our bodies. We\u0027re never going to not have lived that story, but this. new formation and this new life that we create on the other side of it is, is also possible. So it\u0027s not like it has to control the narrative of at all. That\u0027s perfect. I love it. I love it. I love it as a metaphor. Yeah. So just in case folks are not familiar with the Christian patriarchy. Would you mind talking about some of the key factors and, and feel free [00:06:00] to just share like how that showed up in your family as well. Cait: Sure. I try to explain this in the beginning of the book because it\u0027s, I feel like, I relate to a lot of cult documentaries and cult vocabulary, but the Christian patriarchy movement isn\u0027t one singular church. It\u0027s this bigger movement. And there are churches within that, but they\u0027re across different denominations. And what\u0027s really happening is each family is a cult. I know you\u0027ve talked about that too, where the fathers are the cult leaders and. The mothers, the wives and the mothers are supposed to obey their husbands and all things and then the children under underneath that so It\u0027s this hierarchy But it\u0027s based on this literal interpretation of of the Bible at least a cherry picked version of that I would say a katherine: version of the a version Cait: And it\u0027s this it\u0027s really problematic [00:07:00] Belief system where men are on the top, women are beneath them and women essentially don\u0027t have any agency in this system. And so you see it in a lot of churches. Some churches will actually say they\u0027re patriarchal and they\u0027re proud of it, but then other churches will be more subtle about it. And I consider something like complementarianism to be. a version of patriarchy. It\u0027s just more, more subtle, something like soft patriarchy. So the bigger movement, I think we grew up like in the nineties where This was a big part of the homeschooling movement, quiverful ideology, having as many children as you can. So it\u0027s all tied together, I think, with that, and it\u0027s connected to evangelicalism. So it\u0027s very complicated. And people are still living this way, so katherine: Yes, they are. A lot of Cait: churches who are patriarchal. katherine: And I think the connection between the [00:08:00] extreme version of patriarchy that we grew up with and the evangelical version of patriarchy, I think a lot of folks don\u0027t want to acknowledge the connection. And, and I just, I mean, I worked in the evangelical church for almost a decade and they were so proud of how well they cared for women. And the same things existed, they were just smiling more and weren\u0027t as overt about you\u0027re supposed to serve men. But, but that mentality was still embedded into it. And I, I sometimes feel like it can be more damaging when it\u0027s that subtle, because You\u0027re so confused and you\u0027re constantly being gaslit. Yeah. And, and then you can\u0027t address it because they\u0027re constantly like, you know, but we do , right? We do really, we really care about [00:09:00] women. Yeah. And I think that the argument in the Christian Patriarchy movie is the same thing about caring about women because it\u0027s like, this is what\u0027s best for you. Like this is God\u0027s best. For you, and we\u0027re doing this because this is God\u0027s best. Talk about how that dynamic showed up for you of, and just the, so it\u0027s your father giving you these rules. What is that extra layer that\u0027s added when he\u0027s doing it in God\u0027s name? Cait: Right. There\u0027s secular patriarchy, right? And so religious patriarchy takes that idea of men are in charge, men should be the leaders men should benefit from the way society is built, and it adds that level of divine blessing. It\u0027s almost like, Back in the day when kings said they were divinely appointed to be kings. So it\u0027s your father saying he\u0027s divinely appointed to be [00:10:00] the authoritarian leader in your life. And, If for me, that meant if I disobeyed my dad, it was disobeying God, which meant I deserved eternal punishment in hell. So it\u0027s very fear based mentality, but when you believe that you take it very seriously. And so I think that\u0027s why it falls under spiritual abuse because you\u0027re, they\u0027re using God and this threat of, of divine punishment and, and to build, to hold up men with power. In your life. And so there\u0027s, they\u0027re talking like they\u0027re talking for God, basically, and you\u0027re supposed to obey them no matter what. But when you realize that\u0027s not actually God\u0027s voice, it can be devastating to realize like it\u0027s all built on a lie. katherine: it\u0027s a genius mechanism and every cult leader has used it because it works like [00:11:00] to just be able to say like, Oh, it\u0027s not me saying this. Yeah. This is, this is the Lord. I\u0027m just, I\u0027m just following what God, God wants me to do. And the cult leaders will do that. They\u0027ll like reflect back onto the deity. And that\u0027s what makes it a cult, in my opinion, because. They, they have set themselves up as this divine leader, but in this way that I am special and I am chosen by the Lord, you know, and, and you can\u0027t question it. Cait: Right. And it\u0027s like, it\u0027s so violating for your, your spiritual life because growing up I really wanted to follow God. I wanted to, I, I was taught that God was loving and that I should. Church. You know, like I belonged and so I really was committed to that. So when the men in my life were using that [00:12:00] against me to keep me under control and to keep me from making choices about my life, especially as I became an adult, it, it was really disruptive to how I even viewed the world. katherine: Yeah. Cause it\u0027s everything. Cait: Yeah. katherine: And, and. And I just think of like, how much our identity was rooted in our gender. And like, how, just when you discover gender is a theory. Wait a second. And human beings. We\u0027re really not, there\u0027s some, you know, normalized like biological differences, but in general, like there\u0027s, there\u0027s not a lot of difference. And when you realize how deeply embedded this lie is, and yet it was so much a part of our identity, it\u0027s so disrupting. And I think [00:13:00] that that\u0027s something that a lot of people can\u0027t. Understand and we can we can experience validation on the other side of it of like, well, why did you believe that? Like, that\u0027s stupid. That\u0027s dumb. Talk to me a little bit about that. And how do you experience that invalidation from folks once you got out of https: otter. ai Well, why did you stay? And cause you were 20, 26. Cait: I was 25 katherine: when I left 25 when you left. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Tell me about some of the invalidation that you have experienced. Cait: Well, I, I avoided talking about it at all for a long time. And I remember the first time I shared a little bit of my story with a coworker. She didn\u0027t seem to get it, and then later I heard her talking about me like I was Amish. She was telling somebody that I grew up Amish, and I was like, no, but I didn\u0027t correct her, because it\u0027s like, well, they\u0027re kind of the same thing, it\u0027s just they look a little bit different externally. you know, I knew [00:14:00] right away that, My experience was not the norm and that people wouldn\u0027t get it. And so I avoided talking about it a lot and I\u0027m very much a book learner and. You know, being homeschooled, I had to teach myself a lot. So I feel like I studied. Outside culture when I left and try to fit in as best I could. And I remember another job I was working at a community college and I shared something with a coworker there and he was so confused, like, well, then why are you acting so normal? Like, are you like, why do you speak English? Yeah. Like so confused that I like. was a normal human being. And I was like, I don\u0027t know what you, what you want from me. katherine: What do you want Cait: from me? Yeah. Cause I think people have this idea that you grow up and you\u0027re just like an alien, you know, if you believe extreme, what other [00:15:00] people believe are extreme ideologies. But for us, it wasn\u0027t extreme. It was normal. And I just didn\u0027t have anything to compare it to. So that was just the way I grew up. And I. Now that I\u0027ve left, I don\u0027t know if there is like a normal way to grow up. I think people go through a lot of hard times. Yeah, katherine: absolutely. And people Cait: believe a lot of, to me, seem like they\u0027re strange beliefs. You know, I think a lot of people believe things. It\u0027s just a matter of like how committed you are to it and how willing you are to put relationships above your beliefs, which didn\u0027t happen in my family. So katherine: meaning that you\u0027re the beliefs came first, Cait: right? Like doctrine was more important than people. And I think that\u0027s when you get into these cult like environments is when the beliefs are more important. The doctrine is more important. It doesn\u0027t matter who\u0027s being harmed, especially when you can say, Oh, this is love, even though you\u0027re being, I hate that because it\u0027s like, [00:16:00] You know, it, it messes with your head when you, when someone\u0027s telling you, they love you and this is love and I\u0027m hitting you because I love you. And then it\u0027s just abuse. You just don\u0027t have the word for that. katherine: Yeah. And I think that that\u0027s helpful just for wider abuse situations is, this is getting more complex and stuff, but like. This is not presented to people as abuse, like, like nobody, like the leaders and our fathers are not coming at us like I\u0027m here to abuse you. They are, they are presenting it as love and doing what is right and doing what God wants you to do. And then. If we have any feeling of like, I don\u0027t like this, or I don\u0027t want this to happen, or I don\u0027t like this direction, then we instantly. Self gaslight self and validate because it must [00:17:00] be my problem at must be me not devoted enough to God, or not trusting my father that he actually loves me. What were some things that I don\u0027t want, I want people to read your book, but give me maybe one or two things that caused you to wake up and say something isn\u0027t okay here. Like, yeah. And start that process. Cait: Yeah. And I think it kind of ties into what we were talking about before of, of like the outside world and how they perceive you. So I, I found that people on the outside thought that I had chosen this life. You know, versus I\u0027d grown up in it. And I think a lot of people in cults. Or high control groups, they might choose initially to join, but then they become so limited in their choices that it\u0027s not really true consent anymore. So I think that\u0027s a big misunderstanding. So one of the [00:18:00] biggest things that happened to me, it sounds like such a small thing, but a couple people when I was in, you know, my early twenties, they asked me if I was okay with this life and if this was my choice. And. One of them was my sister in law, my brother had left years earlier, and another person, and they didn\u0027t realize how much that affected me because, of course, I had my answers, like, Oh, yes, this is my choice, and I\u0027m gonna be a wife and mother someday. I don\u0027t need to go to college. I don\u0027t need to have a job. So I had the script that I could say, But just them asking my opinion and what I wanted, nobody had ever asked me that before, because it didn\u0027t matter what I wanted and my choices didn\u0027t matter. So, so they didn\u0027t have to do a whole lot to get me to think for myself. It was just a, just a simple question of, well, what do you think? And I was like, well, nobody, nobody cares about what I think. [00:19:00] And katherine: that Cait: was really impactful for me. So that\u0027s, that\u0027s one part. Of me like mentally trying to leave another part in the story is when I have this long courtship and my father puts an end to it. I\u0027m feeling heartbroken. And then I am punished because I have too many. I feel love for this person that I thought I was going to marry and. In my father\u0027s opinion, that\u0027s emotional impurity. And so I\u0027ve basically cheated on my future spouse by loving this other man. And I have to repent and, you know, turn back to the right path. And I just knew that I just knew in that moment, like, this is wrong. This can\u0027t be true because. How could me loving someone be wrong katherine: or Cait: sinful or deserve God\u0027s wrath? And so I just didn\u0027t believe it at that moment. I was like, [00:20:00] that\u0027s not true. And I kept that to myself. Well, I actually think I did say something to my dad, like, how can that be wrong? That didn\u0027t go over very well, but katherine: Oh my goodness. Cait: It took me four more years to leave, you know, so, but, Okay. Those were big moments for me to shift my thinking and start thinking for myself, start making plans and realizing I might be able to choose something different in the future. katherine: Mm hmm. I think that\u0027s why I enjoy talking to you, like, whenever we get to spend time with each other and talk about our families. It\u0027s just such a It\u0027s so soothing and like such a relief to talk to you because I\u0027ll tell, I\u0027ll tell the story to other people. And there\u0027s, there could be fun. I have a group of friends where like, I\u0027ll talk about it and we\u0027ll just like laugh about it and just be like, Oh my gosh, I\u0027ll just like, make fun, make fun of it. But I think that. Just talking to you, you get how [00:21:00] complex it is. And like, everyone is like, well, I wouldn\u0027t put up with that. And I would just, you know, flip the middle finger and I would be done with it. And like all of the layers that are, that are present, not just that emotional layer and that trauma bond and that betrayal bond that exists, but then the Economic layer too, of not having a college degree, not being able to have a career, not having we had skills, like we knew how to do things, but we didn\u0027t know how to write resumes. We didn\u0027t know how to, you know interview, we didn\u0027t know how to apply for a job, you know, like gratefully we had like, You know, drivers license and social security numbers, but there are plenty of people who don\u0027t even have that. And yeah, you know, wives whose have their husbands have their passports locked away in a safe. And, you know, just like all of these dynamics that, [00:22:00] like, You\u0027re you\u0027re traumatized and you\u0027re in the survival state and you\u0027re trying to figure out how to escape with all of these things against you. Like four years is a long time, but it\u0027s also like, that\u0027s how long it takes to just kind of figure out like what to do, where to go, especially when you and I were both raised in this, like to even have, we don\u0027t have a baseline. to go to. We\u0027re having to like create our own baseline with nothing. Cait: Yeah. And I was so, I was so angry at my younger self for not leaving, like years later in my thirties. Now I\u0027ve found myself just feeling really pissed at her. Like, why don\u0027t you just like give yourself a chance? Cause I lost so much of my, well, I lost my entire adolescence and my most of my twenties to this. And so [00:23:00] I felt a lot of anger. But then, you know, processing that, feeling all my feelings, you know, what we\u0027re supposed to do, and then realizing, all the feelings. I feel all the feelings. And trying to learn to have compassion for her. And I, I do feel differently now. I\u0027ve shifted to feeling more compassion because she didn\u0027t have a lot of options. It was very unsafe to do anything outside of the rules. katherine: And Cait: she didn\u0027t know, she didn\u0027t have any practice doing that. So katherine: you Cait: know, it\u0027s, when people are going through this, it\u0027s, there\u0027s a lot of shame, I think, that we can feel when we don\u0027t leave right away or we, you know, we go through stuff and we don\u0027t stand up for ourselves. We can feel a lot of shame afterwards, but I think it\u0027s, it\u0027s important to not blame ourselves for abuse. That\u0027s just, you know, it\u0027s not our fault. katherine: It\u0027s not. Yeah. I think one of the thoughts that I had a lot was like, why did I let him do that to me? Like, why did I, what? And it was, [00:24:00] it\u0027s just like, I mean, I know I\u0027m just like looking at it, you know, from a distance, like I didn\u0027t let him, like, I didn\u0027t know that there were, you know, like, like you\u0027re, you don\u0027t really have any agency and any choice and it\u0027s not safe to like fight back or talk back. And, you know, it\u0027s just. It\u0027s that reality and it\u0027s such a survival mechanism, such a common trauma response to feel that way, because we\u0027re, we\u0027re trying to create a narrative where we had some control. So then we don\u0027t have that same situation happened to us again, and we can avoid it. And, and, and it\u0027s, it\u0027s difficult to grasp. That someone, especially in a dynamic like ours, where it was family and it was our father, you know, like to grasp that someone would just mistreat us and to just let all of that be on [00:25:00] them and recognize we did nothing to deserve this treatment and That\u0027s so much easier said than done. It is, it\u0027s a part of the process of getting to that place where we can let all of that responsibility lay at the foot of the abusers and not carry that and recognize ways that we did fight back. And that\u0027s my next question for you. What are ways that you see now that you did fight back while you were in it? Cait: I was very good rule follower for most of my childhood. I have older, I had two older siblings. And so watching them get punished, I was like, I\u0027m not going to do that. And so I learned really early on how to get on my dad\u0027s good side which sounds manipulative, but really it was just safety coping mechanism. katherine: Absolutely. Cait: So, I felt like for most of my childhood, I didn\u0027t fight back at all. I [00:26:00] just felt really passive. But the one outlet for me was reading. And for some reason, books seemed non threatening to my, my father, like movies were. So books for some reason seemed mostly neutral to him. So I could go to the library and read almost anything. I was very good at self policing. I would throw books in the trash if I thought they didn\u0027t follow the rules. And I hate that I did that. I hate that I did that. But I still read them. I just felt guilty afterwards. But I remember in my 20s reading a few young adult novels. And like, it just felt like this anthropology, like, class and like the young adult, like, what is a teenager like? Let me investigate this. What, katherine: what Cait: is this katherine: specimen? Cait: Yeah. Yeah. And it was, I couldn\u0027t relate to what they were doing in the stories, but I could relate to how they felt. And I think I didn\u0027t throw those ones [00:27:00] away. I hid them. And I mean, I was in my 20s. I shouldn\u0027t have had to hide any books. I know. katherine: Yeah. Cait: Things like that, where I was like, I\u0027m going to find this information for myself and not tell anybody. That, that was resistance in a way. It wasn\u0027t standing up to my father. I didn\u0027t stand up to my father until I realized he was sabotaging every chance at A marriage that I had, and I talk about a few of them in the book, but there was like at least four potential relationships that he shut down. And the last one is the person I, I married, I\u0027m still married to, and I knew from the previous relationships that I didn\u0027t want him to ruin my, the rest of my life, and I was falling in love with this person and didn\u0027t want to give up. So that was my big, big deal. My big leap of resistance was saying, I get to love who I love and I\u0027m going to fight for that relationship. And so that was the big [00:28:00] catalyst for me to leave. katherine: Yeah. How do you make sense of the fact that like you\u0027re being raised to get married and I have the same experience, like in my family of just like we\u0027re being raised conditioned incubated to be wives. Yet, it just seems like my father didn\u0027t actually want us to get married, like you made it so hard and like any guys that. You know, tried to do the things they could never get it right. And it was just awful, awful, awful explosions every time. And it was like, do you actually want us to get married? How do you make sense of that? Like watching that happen? Cait: Yeah. I mean, I just, I can speculate. I don\u0027t know. Like I, I\u0027ve, I can speculate that my father really loves to control. And it\u0027s interesting [00:29:00] because he let my sister get married. Well, she, he found somebody who\u0027s just like him for my sister to get married to. And so that went off, you know, she was able to get married and she\u0027s divorced now. So she\u0027s been through a whole journey of, of coming out that direction. But for me, I don\u0027t know if he like, I always, my family always said I was his favorite, which bothers me now. And I think I was just really good at conforming. And so I don\u0027t know if he wanted to let go of his control over me. Like it was really difficult to do anything. And I\u0027m not sure if he would have felt like such a strong person. Like I was for a time, I was the only kid living in the house because my brother had gone to live with the pastor. It\u0027s a whole nother story. With trying to get men to be like leaders, you know, when they go live with your pastor. So I was the only, I was the only kid left, right? So maybe he just didn\u0027t want to let go of me. [00:30:00] And who would his, what would his identity be without children to rule over? I don\u0027t know. So that\u0027s, that\u0027s the speculation I have. But nobody, nobody could was perfect enough. And also I wasn\u0027t attracted to people like him. I think katherine: I Cait: didn\u0027t want to marry somebody who was narcissistic. katherine: That was part of it. Yeah. If I remember correctly, was your older sister kind of, In quotes, rebellious and like the marriage kind of tamed was like meant to tame her. Is that kind of like the dynamic that happened there? Cait: Yeah, she almost eloped with somebody and decided at the last minute not to do that and came home and was like repentant. And then like a year or so later, my dad helped find a husband for her and You know, I, I don\u0027t know if she really had a true choice in that relationship. So it was really, it\u0027s really tragic to me to remember those times. [00:31:00] Yeah. Being confused, thinking that she was choosing it. But knowing now that we didn\u0027t have many choices at all. katherine: Right. And, Cait: yeah, but now seeing her come through that and being a single mom and working and, you know, she owns land now, it\u0027s, it\u0027s beautiful to see her come into herself now. katherine: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah. The whole control thing around marriage when like, you\u0027re being like conditioned for that, but then they sabotage it every turn or, and I, I remember thinking that logically about like, my father like wants me to marry someone like him and similar to you. That\u0027s not gonna work for me. But at the same time, being aware that anyone that was like him, they just massively butted heads. And so it\u0027s like, it\u0027s not gonna work because someone like him will fight back, you know, like, won\u0027t, won\u0027t. Won\u0027t be the pleasing, compliant, [00:32:00] sit at his feet, learn from him, you know, like, it\u0027s like, pick, pick, pick a team, like, which one do you want? And that, I mean, I think that\u0027s a characteristic of both of our upbringings and any cult like setting, high control fundamentalist setting is. Illogic and confusion are everywhere and as like certain as they want it to be and, you know, right and orthodox as they claim that it is. There\u0027s so much confusion and just different like speaking out of different sides of the mouth and all really boils down to is that key leader gets to decide. Cait: Yeah, like the purity culture. The purity culture, like, leads it to everything. So, you know, everything has to be perfect. I grew up, like, really Calvinist. So, like, all your actions have to be perfect. And so, I think that\u0027s part of it. Like, you can never find a [00:33:00] suitable husband that was absolutely perfect for me. Because there\u0027s always a flaw that he would find. And I, we live very isolated. So, I imagine if I lived back where I had grown up in Colorado, it would have been a little easier for him to find a husband for me. That would have fit his description, but we lived pretty isolated after at that point. So I don\u0027t think anybody measured up to his perfect standard. katherine: Yeah, he couldn\u0027t go on a nation tour to find the perfect husbands. Oh my gosh, it\u0027s just like so weird. Cait: Or writing the letters. He didn\u0027t do that. I refused to let him write letters. katherine: Oh, to, like, seek a husband for you. Yeah, Cait: because in the book I talk about that one woman who lived with us because she wanted to get married. katherine: And your father, like, found someone. Cait: Yeah, he wrote letters to every church in our district, you know, our presbytery, and found somebody. And I was like, that\u0027s [00:34:00] not, I do not want you to do that for me. I would be mortified. katherine: Male order husband. No, not okay. Not okay. Not okay. Were you like expressing like desperation and like wanting to get married? No. No. Cait: Yeah. I, I\u0027ve all my friends got married so young and I was like, I want to fall in love. I want to like travel the world. I didn\u0027t really, you know, I had those desires for romance, but not like must become wife and mother that, that really. katherine: Yeah. I\u0027m glad though. I think it probably saved you. Intrinsic, intrinsic desires, your desires, like what you really wanted actually helped save you. Cait: Yeah. katherine: Talk to me about writing and how that played a role has played a role in your journey. Cait: I think writing has always been like, it\u0027s tied with reading books. I\u0027ve always been away from me to escape. And so I always wanted to write a book. [00:35:00] And I think telling stories was always difficult for me because I didn\u0027t have a whole lot of data to write stories from. But I was just, I just would want it to be a writer. And so when I finally left. I thought, I\u0027m going to go to college and study how to write, you know, and actually learn how to do this. That became a way for me to express myself. You know, I had been, I\u0027m a really quiet person, or at least I used to be. And so writing is a way for me to use my voice without feeling panicked about being too loud. I don\u0027t feel that way anymore, but that\u0027s, you know, that\u0027s how I felt. And writing, I wanted to write fiction and My own story kept bleeding through everything and no matter what I was writing at school It ended up being about the way I was raised or what I had gone through and I was like dang it I don\u0027t want to write about that. Like this is not important anymore and [00:36:00] That was incorrect and it needed to get written out Like I needed to get it out of my body and onto some paper and that\u0027s why I started writing my particular story And it was really freeing. when I started sharing some of it online, that\u0027s when I realized I\u0027m not the only person who\u0027s gone through this. That kind of set me off to this whole journey of writing my story publicly and connecting with people who grew up in this movement. And it\u0027s been really liberating. Really like, it feels like a lot, a lot of the time because telling our stories is really vulnerable, but I don\u0027t, I wouldn\u0027t change a thing. Like, I feel stronger because I\u0027m able to be authentic, you know, instead of trying to hide who I am. katherine: Yeah, absolutely. Do you feel like this has kind of like gotten it out and that you are ready for [00:37:00] something new or do you feel like there\u0027s still more to come? story to tell. Cait: I feel, I\u0027m really great, really excited to write some fiction now. I\u0027ve been like playing around with some stories and I feel like I have some actual outside in the world experience to draw from and maybe something more interesting to say. And so, yeah, I feel liberated now that my story is done. It\u0027s out there. It can go do its work and I can write something else now. So I\u0027m excited to see what that\u0027s like. I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ll ever be able to get away from What I\u0027m interested in like, which is psychology and like personal trauma and resilience and those kinds of themes. I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ll ever get away from that because that\u0027s just who I am, but I don\u0027t think I need to write my memoir again. katherine: Yeah, it\u0027s done. I did it. Yeah, we good. What are your hopes and dreams for people reading your book? Cait: My first, you know, when you\u0027re when you\u0027re trying to sell a book to a publisher, [00:38:00] they always ask you what your audience is. is and you have like different layers of audience. My number one audience has always been people who grew up like me or who are in domestic abuse situations or who have left those. I want them to feel seen the way certain books have helped me feel seen because I\u0027m a trans woman. To my knowledge, there\u0027s not a memoir out there about being a stay at home daughter or besides maybe the Duggar Girls books. So I think, I\u0027m really hoping that people who grew up this way feel like they can see their own experience on the page and, and help them process, you know, because for me, writing it is a, is the way I process it. And I\u0027m hoping that people who love to read will, that will help them. And then. I hope that people who didn\u0027t grow up this way will have a little bit more understanding of how complex it is. You know, I\u0027ve, I think some people might say, Oh, this isn\u0027t, isn\u0027t as extreme as like the book educated [00:39:00] where there\u0027s, you know, more physical violence. But I want people to understand that that doesn\u0027t necessarily matter to how people can be harmed. I think katherine: it\u0027s still Cait: important and we shouldn\u0027t shut people down because they don\u0027t have physical injuries. I think this kind of abuse is damaging too. I hope it\u0027s, it opens that conversation up a little bit more because I think this is a pretty common experience. katherine: Oh yeah, I think it\u0027s so common and I think I would say that\u0027s one thing I do appreciate your book is that the normal things that end up making a story sensational like violence or sexual abuse the, the, the level of it isn\u0027t there yet you are still able to show the damage. That it did to you and I think that\u0027s going to be so validating for so many people and just kind of flipping the narrative, you know, like people just [00:40:00] chase after those types of stories for the sensationalism, but there\u0027s a lot of damage that happens in. The shadows and looks like Christianity looks like love, and you are able to express that really well in your book. So I hope folks, folks read it and tell, tell people where they can find it and tell people where they can find you. Cait: Yeah. My website is Kate west. com. So I do have links for the book there as well as events I\u0027m doing. So Come find me where you live. Hopefully I come close to you and you can buy the book anywhere online. It\u0027s going to be. In bookstores as well. I know Barnes and Noble is stocking them in, in quite a few of their stores and then you can order them from your independent bookstore. You can ask for them at your library. So you don\u0027t even have to spend money. You could just ask for a copy at your library. Do that katherine: people! Support [00:41:00] the libraries and support Facebook. Cait: Yeah, you don\u0027t have to support writers just by buying their books. You can get them at your libraries and that really does help because the libraries buy them and then other people can read them too. And I\u0027m also, there\u0027s a hardcover, an ebook and an audio book. So I got to read the audio. If you\u0027d rather listen to me reading the story, you can do that too. So there\u0027s all the different formats as well. katherine: Fantastic. Any other thoughts or any other things that you want to say? Cait: I\u0027d love to hear what you think about the book when you read it. I hope there\u0027s a contact form on my page, on my website, and I\u0027m on social media, so I\u0027d love to hear what you think. Yeah. Just hit me up. katherine: Fantastic.

      "description": "We\u2019re talking about how one of the characteristics of a cult is that they often present as a really good thing. A lot of times, they are doing really good things on the surface. If this weren\u2019t the case, people wouldn\u2019t be joining them. Additionally, not every cult starts as a cult. Sometimes it starts as on organization with really good intentions to help people. We\u2019ll discuss all of that, in this episode. https://www.ted.com/talks/sarah_edmondson_how_to_spot_a_cult Sarah Edmondson is a Canadian actress who has starred in the CBS series Salvation and more than twelve films for the Hallmark Channel and Lifetime. She is also a well-established voice-over artist for popular series such as Transformers: Cybertron and My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic. In 2005, when NXIVM, a personal and professional development company, promised to provide the tools and insight Sarah needed to reach her potential, she was intrigued. Over her twelve-year tenure, she went from student to coach and eventually operated her own NXIVM center in Vancouver. Questions kept coming up about the organization\u2019s rules and practices, which came to a head in 2017 when she accepted an invitation from her best friend to join DOS, a \u201Csecret sisterhood\u201D within NXIVM. In 2019, Sarah published Scarred: The True Story of How I Escaped NXIVM, the Cult that Bound My Life, with Kristine Gasbarre. In this tell-all memoir, she shares her story from the moment she takes her first seminar to her harrowing fight to get out. Her full story as a whistleblower is featured in the CBC podcast Uncover: Escaping NXIVM (downloaded over 25 million times) and The Vow , the critically acclaimed HBO documentary series on NXIVM. Now with the launch of \u201CA Little Bit Culty,\u201D Sarah and her co-host/husband Anthony \u201CNippy\u201D Ames are keeping the conversation going by discussing the healing process with the help of experts and fellow survivors. Uncertain is a podcast of Tears of Eden , a community and resource for those in the aftermath of Spiritual Abuse.

I\u0027m great. How are you Katherine: doing? Okay. Do you know? Okay. It has been gloomy and St. Louis and today the first sign of sunshine and I like went outside to like be in the sun, but it was 30 degrees. And so I didn\u0027t stay there very long, but. It\u0027s beautiful today. Beautiful to see the sun. How are, how\u0027s the weather in your area? Sarah: I\u0027m in Atlanta. We\u0027re in our very brief winter and it\u0027s, it\u0027s, it\u0027s just a couple of weeks, I think. And it really fluctuates on a day to day basis and I have no idea what\u0027s in store and I\u0027m just getting used to that as a concept. Yeah. Katherine: I just kind of ups and downs. Yeah. Yes. I have relatives in the Atlanta area and I hear about the bipolar weather. Of yeah, very [00:02:00] similar to St. Louis fun times. Well, thank you so much for being here and your openness to telling your story here. Really excited to hear from you just about The impact of your experience in NXIVM and then your recovery process. You also have your podcast, a little bit culty that I highly recommend to everyone. It\u0027s just entertaining. It\u0027s good stuff and you learn a lot, but then it\u0027s also super entertaining. And so I hope folks will listen to that as well, but you get to interact with a lot of cult survivors through that. And so I w I\u0027m very interested to hear. Just patterns and things that you have seen as you have been doing your podcast and working with folks in this, this area. But just to just start us, start us off for folks who may not know who you are or have not seen the vow or maybe haven\u0027t. About on HBO or the, or have listened to your podcast and you give us a little summary of who you are and why you are here. Sarah: [00:03:00] Sure. So my cliff notes slash, you know, elevator story, which I\u0027ve had to use a fair bit since moving to Atlanta is that I am, you know, from Canada, born and raised, I. I pursued acting as a teenager and young adult, and I took a little tangent, a little detour when I joined a personal and professional development program, which I was taking to help me with my goals as an actor and my relationship at the time. And that was really wonderful in many ways for a long time at first. And it ended up being 12 years later, after many missed red flags, I didn\u0027t understand what I was looking at. A high control group or some, some people know this term as a cult, but I realized there\u0027s basically bad things going on behind closed doors and the personal development program that I\u0027d been touting for many years as an advocate and as a recruiter for the company. I say company loosely was really a front [00:04:00] for our pipeline, for the leadership. To coerce and manipulate and ultimately not in all cases and not not for me, but for many people sex traffic as well So that\u0027s why it is now known as the sex cult in the in the newsletter And I newsletter sorry in the newspapers The headlines media does love a good sensational story. Sure do. Yes, as they sure do. And my role in that was that I was one of the whistleblowers that showed the physical abuse, which is the physical manifestation of emotional abuse, which had been going on for years in the form of branding. And I showed that on the New York times cover and that led to an investigation and the trial and eventual conviction of the leader. Six week trial led to 120 year conviction of the leader. And that was I left six years ago. The trial was about four years ago and three years ago, two and a half years ago. My sense of time is a [00:05:00] little off. My husband and I were in a docuseries that, that documented this whole journey, how we got in and how we escaped on HBO max called the vow. And that really propelled us into this really interesting space where, where we were now sharing something that a lot of people could relate to is like, Oh, I would\u0027ve, I would\u0027ve totally joined that. And that\u0027s flipped the script as a lot up until then. So many people we encountered, especially since leaving and shouting from the rooftops, we were in a cult you know, they were watching it going. I could have, I could have fallen for that when that\u0027s very different when the past people would say I would never have fallen for that. And that\u0027s opened up a whole, you know, set of bizarre doors and opportunities for us as whistleblowers and survivors to speak about our experience. Educate people. And that\u0027s been like a phenomenally rewarding thing. And ironically, and I didn\u0027t say this at the beginning, I, one of the reasons I joined next team as well was to help people. I was, you know, I really enjoyed that process and [00:06:00] now I get to do it for real on the other side and help educate, shine light, prevent, help people get out. If they\u0027re already in something, help people heal. If they\u0027ve already gotten out. All the different stages along the way and help families. And overall just bring awareness to this topic that is kind of become a lot more mainstream now. Narcissism, cultic abuse, gaslighting. It\u0027s much more accessible and people are more aware of it. So it\u0027s been an interesting time to be part of the zeitgeist in that way. And and then now we have a podcast that emerged in COVID when we had stopped acting. So it\u0027s been a interesting, organic progression to be a podcaster as I wrote a book and also and now doing more speaking events and panels on the topic. So yeah, here we are. There we are. Yeah. Cliff notes. Katherine: Yes. I remember watching the vow. I don\u0027t remember. I think it was in during COVID watching it and [00:07:00] had just left an abusive church. And that was cult cults like they\u0027re definitely very high control, very lot of, you know, stuff being hidden by religiosity and God speak and Jesus talk. And I, I, a lot of us. who had left were like, have you seen The Vow? Have you guys been watching The Vow? Are you watching The Vow? Because The Vow is like very, very, very similar to what we just went through. And I think that that was the thing that stood out to me as well as how engaging it was. And it just I was like, that sounds like Christianity, like so much of so much of the, the attraction and the way that like the evangelizing that was happening and the way that people were getting brought into this thing that, that was presented as this very good thing. And in some ways it seemed like it actually was a good thing. Yeah. Tell me a little bit about that part of [00:08:00] it of like what attracted you to this. And like, what, what drew you in as a very professional human being? Sarah: Yeah. You know what? There\u0027s every single group that we\u0027ve ever talked to anyone about in our podcast. There is always good stuff on the outside. And that\u0027s actually one of the first questions we ask people so that others can. See what some of those red flags are of like, you know, what\u0027s the catch with this perfect, shiny, amazing, happy community. Well, what, what drew me in was a number of things. And, and partly it was, you know, the age that I was. Where I was, you know, doing this acting work and it wasn\u0027t really filling my soul. It wasn\u0027t filling my cup in terms of like, this is not the meaningful work that I want to be doing. And the thought of. Cause really they offered a lot of things. The community was presented almost in a way that would appeal to whatever the person wants. And I later learned to do that for others. Like what, what is it that you\u0027re looking for? What I was looking for was a, [00:09:00] a community, a supportive, helpful community. I was looking for more meaning and purpose in my life being a, you know, Being in a Budweiser commercial wasn\u0027t like really that meaningful to me, even though it paid well, but it was like, this is not what I signed up for or what I wanted as an actor. And I\u0027ve always been into personal development. I\u0027ve always believed that. And I still believe actually that you can work on yourself or be, you know, be better or like work through. And there was a term that they used. I don\u0027t think I was really using this term before was limiting beliefs. That there\u0027s beliefs that we have, and I actually do believe that we have still believe that we have limiting beliefs about ourselves. Like Katherine: something like, I can\u0027t do it. Like, yeah. Sarah: Yeah. Yeah. Just like, you know, even as an actor, like even thinking things, thinking something like, which was had at the time, like I always get nervous and auditions, there\u0027s some beliefs under that about myself that caused me to be nervous. [00:10:00] Which would limit me about, you know, without, with auditions, cause that\u0027s like a big part of being an actor. So I really love the idea of working through my limiting beliefs, being, the best version of myself and, and striving to follow this model. And one of the things that appealed to me, I mean, I didn\u0027t like it at the beginning, but I eventually did like it after my first five day training, which is my first foray into Nexium is they offered this growth path in the form of. Like a martial arts system with different levels and stripes and colors and I liked that. Like I, there was something about that that was measurable for me. If I do this, I\u0027ll go to the next level and that, that appealed to me because an actor, we don\u0027t have that either, like get the job or you don\u0027t, you don\u0027t really know why you do or you don\u0027t, and you could do all the right things, but not actually go to the next level. So I liked the concept of being able to. Complete a task, work on a skill, and, and evolve. It was certainty. With certainty. Yeah, it was [00:11:00] certainty in a very uncertain world. Needless to say, I mean, it was all bullshit, but if it was what it was supposed to be, it would have been great. Katherine: Yeah. And if it is, if it is something that like is actually delivering what it\u0027s promising, then it would be a really awesome. Yes, exactly. Yeah, so, so those were some of the good things that drew you in just to create some context for folks what were some of the, like, things that started alarms, that started going off that were like, Hmm, maybe this isn\u0027t what it, what it\u0027s promising. Sarah: I mean, Honestly, there were, there were red flags right from the beginning, but I didn\u0027t know what I was looking at. If I had done, if I, if somebody invited me to something now that was. And with the education I have, I wouldn\u0027t have even signed the paperwork, let alone attended because I would have known, Oh, I\u0027m feeling pressured and they\u0027re using a scarcity mentality in order to, you know, [00:12:00] like this is the only one. And when, you know, when are you going to do this and when are you going to change your life? And any hesitation I had would be. Proof of how I was not ready to commit to my goals. Like it was a lot of manipulation tactics just getting me there. And then once I was there a lot of red flags in regards to what I now know as setting the stage for future abuse. Even as simple as they said, like, you\u0027re going to feel uncomfortable and you\u0027re going to feel like you\u0027re going to, you\u0027re going to doubt that maybe even this is the right place for you to be. That internal dialogue is an indication of what they call the disintegration. So you\u0027re either integrated on a concept or disintegrated and any internal questioning was just a sign that you needed to work on something. I know. So, if you agree to that, which I did. Because I\u0027m, I\u0027m assuming that these people who, I just never, I never projected bad intent because that\u0027s the thing is when you give yourself over to a higher power or a higher authority, [00:13:00] you\u0027re saying, you know, better than I do. And tell me, tell me what to do. Tell me how to be. And I was, I was like, okay, well, I pay just paid like 20. 2, 100 is 2, 500 Canadian to spend five days in a room and I want to work on my issues. I am saying, I trust you. You got to tell me what you see and if what they\u0027re saying is different than how I feel, that\u0027s a problem. Katherine: Yeah, absolutely. Oh, and that\u0027s such a such an easy thing to happen and then it\u0027s presented as you\u0027re like to listen to someone else tell you and name you and tell you what you need to work on and listen to someone else outside of you is. Is held up as like a humble thing and like a character quality. Yes. And if you were to resist and ask questions or say, I don\u0027t feel comfortable with Sarah: this. And that\u0027s, Oh, then I\u0027m also being defiant. Katherine: Yeah. Yeah. Or selfish or, or you don\u0027t want to work on your issues or you don\u0027t really care Sarah: about this. Yeah. I mean, they said that you should be able to ask [00:14:00] questions and put your hand up, but it was very clear when people did ask questions, you know, how they felt about that. And also like it was, I learned very quickly that there were names for the feelings I was having that weren\u0027t good. So I was just suppress them. And I want also, I\u0027m a good girl, I want to be a good girl, I want to get it right, I like the gold stars. Yeah. I like the validation. Katherine: Absolutely. And there was a very clear like type of person that fit and you like, learned to Sarah: fit. Yes. I learned to fit and I wanted to get the, I wanted to go up the levels and I wanted to get the next stripe. And I learned to override the feelings because the other thing they said is like, you\u0027re here to work on your shit. You\u0027re here to work on your stuff. So. Yeah. You know, don\u0027t leave. We\u0027re just talking about these things. If the sash around your neck, there was a sash systems for the martial arts ranks. If that bothers you, why can\u0027t you even talk about it in a room? Like we\u0027re just talking about it. So I should be able to talk about it. And so therefore don\u0027t leave. If I\u0027m leaving, I\u0027m just running away from my issues. so [00:15:00] many double binds. We call them massive double. Katherine: Yes, literally the phrase that popped into my head. Yes. Well, I, I want folks to be able to hear your whole story. And so I\u0027ll just plug your book, which is called scarred. Correct. Sarah: Yes, thank you. And I don\u0027t know if you ever do giveaways on your podcast, but we can do that too. Katherine: Let\u0027s do it. Why not? Yeah, I haven\u0027t done one of those in a long time. Let\u0027s do it. And then a little bit culty, and then also the vow on HBO, or not HBO on max. So those are places that folks can get more. About your story and actually get your get your full story and all the details about that. And so I want to step into talking about the impact of this. And if you want to talk about the impact like while you were in it and like what, what this coercive control manipulation was doing to you while you were in it. And then very specifically after after you left, like how was so I\u0027m going to ask you to tell us a little [00:16:00] bit about how you experienced this, this trauma showing up for you and what, what did this experience do to you? And if you want to also share some examples of just similar patterns you\u0027ve seen in folks that you have been interviewing on your podcast as well. Yeah, just paint us a picture of what happens after this experience. Sarah: After leaving? Yes. I mean, there was many different stages, I would say, like I\u0027ve been out for six years and there was a lot of just grief, like I was, I had a massive PTSD reaction or potentially CPTSD just from the sort of ongoing abuse, but I, in many ways, I was like kind of the, one of the least Can I swear on this podcast? I was one of the least fucked with because, because I was a recruiter and I brought so many people in many ways, they kind of left me alone. I, I had, I was in Vancouver. I was running, I had been running my center. Which is sort of like a. You know, a separate, like, it\u0027s sort of like a franchise. Like I had my, I had [00:17:00] my center and I was using the tools and the parts of the program that were good and that I liked. And I, you know, brought people in that were going up the pipeline to the leadership. So they kind of left me alone, but I, so I didn\u0027t have the same amount of. 100 percent commitment. Like I\u0027d never moved to Albany. I\u0027d never moved and given up my whole life. And I always had my foot in reality. In other words, like my foot outside of the compound, it wasn\u0027t an actual compound, but some people gave up everything to be there, you know? And so that kept me in many ways, it protected me and gave me a soft place to land. There\u0027s a lot of people I could go to and that I always knew that we. Were you know, people thought that we were in a cult. I, I knew that. And I, and I thought that they just didn\u0027t understand. Mm-Hmm. , right. I just, I was like, oh, they don\u0027t get it. And for, for the first couple of weeks. And, you know, I was just going through those people and being like, okay, you were right. And I\u0027m sorry. And I\u0027m really kind of fucked up right [00:18:00] now. Shouting from the rooftop and like doing all the stuff that we did to get the media attention and things like that so there was like different stages of first I was on this yeah rampage of like I got to take this thing down and I felt like I was one of the There\u0027s a few of us that were at the forefront of that and I think in many ways It was the ones that of us that could whereas other people were so had been so head fucked and so gaslit and so manipulated that they were like, you know, literally in bed depressed Couldn\u0027t move or, or just had to shut down and like pretend it never happened and move cities and like not even deal with it, which people dealt with it in different ways. My dealing with it was because I\u0027ve been so public and so such a vouching you know, zealot. I was like a fundamentalist personal growth junkie. Yeah. This is the way, this is the only way, red flag, to person to, you know, to grow and to reach enlightenment or whatever. Like. And so then on the other side, I had to be just as loud. So that was like one big stage, and I spent [00:19:00] like a long time just on the phone with people, trying to de enroll them, trying to explain like, yes, I was branded, and no, I didn\u0027t consent, and no, I didn\u0027t know it was Keith\u0027s initials, and like, trying to show them that it was bad. And for the people who are real diehards, there\u0027s some people who still don\u0027t think that was bad. Because they\u0027ve, they\u0027ve so committed their lives to this path. They\u0027re so bought in and to look now and go like, Oh, maybe this isn\u0027t good is just too hard for them. Like they\u0027re just, yeah, it\u0027s Katherine: just too much given to it and it\u0027s Sarah: just, yeah, it\u0027s easier to go. No, this was good. You know, Keith may have. I\u0027ve heard them say you know, this is, maybe he\u0027s not conventional, but he always, he\u0027s a good person. Like they, they can\u0027t even fathom that maybe he\u0027s a bad person. So. That was one of the stages also was like just really coming to terms with like I lost so many of my of my good friends and I and I and I lost them [00:20:00] quickly. I lost them overnight. So that was a big part of it. Like leaving my community again because I had some community and friends outside of it. I think that was partly what saved me. I, you know, I hadn\u0027t burnt all my bridges, I\u0027d burnt many bridges, for sure, but not all of them. Thankfully there were some friendships I never touched, I never tried to recruit, even though I did try to recruit many people. So I\u0027d say all of, you know, that was a big stage. And then and then I got pregnant. I got pregnant with my second child a couple years after we got out as I was writing a book. And that was, I was, I was really working through and like having a big catharsis with that process. And having to also say no to, like, I was at that time I was going to do a Tedx talk and I was going to do a bunch of things. I was like, that\u0027s gonna be too stressful. And I want to like create a safe, loving incubator for my baby. And that kind of forced me to block out a lot of the stuff that I\u0027ve been doing. There was like a sort of an ongoing campaign still to [00:21:00] expose and destroy and I mean, by say destroy, like, Make sure that nobody else was recruited into NXIVM and those things happen. Like NXIVM itself does no longer exist. There\u0027s no company. Are there people who still believe Keith is good? Yes. So I, that\u0027s part of the reason why I\u0027m still talking because I want to get everybody out. . And then, and then, and then I\u0027d say that like, I\u0027m most, I think it\u0027s a lifelong healing journey, but there\u0027s a lot of things that I\u0027ve done over the years that have really propelled me to another level of healing and yeah, having kids being kind of forced to stay present and not be in that war, that campaign pulled me to another stage. And then there\u0027s just lots of things I do for self care that I wasn\u0027t kind of, I wasn\u0027t allowed to do. It just wasn\u0027t a lot of time for it. Purpose probably. Yeah. On purpose. Yeah. And just like family time and being able to change my schedule and do things like You know, go to the farmer\u0027s markets on the [00:22:00] weekend and the old days when in the cult days that like there was never a free weekend, there was never every weekend if there was a free weekend where there wasn\u0027t a training and be like, Who should we fly out from the mothership to like, do a coach summit or, you know, oh, there\u0027s nothing happening. Let\u0027s organize a, you know, nationwide or citywide barbecue and like, it\u0027ll be a great enrollment opportunity. Like every weekend there was something going on with the You know, with my center and you know, three nights a week as well, Monday and Wednesday. And anyways, it was like always just go, go, go, go, go. So to be able to get my, you know, reclaim my time and, and like clear my schedule, which I think anyone is in any kind of group doesn\u0027t realize until they get out of something and they clear their schedule. They\u0027re like, wow, there\u0027s so much time devoted to this thing. Right. Katherine: Absolutely. And then probably like a reward for that time commitment is always more and always more and always pushing and, and, and to some extent that\u0027s just like wired into our our society. So when we get into a group that\u0027s like that, that just [00:23:00] feels so, so normal. It\u0027s like, that\u0027s just what you do in this group. I remember being in the, the abusive church and like. It was going through a lot and a lot of people were leaving and there would be these like events that we would have every year. And there were a few times where we were like looking around and we\u0027re like, we\u0027ve lost staff. We are exhausted. Can we just not do this event? Can we just Not do this this year, because we\u0027re so tired and the leadership was like, it was always like, you know, PR move like no we have to pretend like everything is fine and you have to present like a united front to the, to the, you know, congregation and like having to like, you know, just kind of power through these events, and there wasn\u0027t this like posture of like what\u0027s best. For you and care. I mean, like want to like intentionally care for this community. That idea of like, no, we know what\u0027s best for you and we know what\u0027s best. And this is what what\u0027s best looks like and always moving and always pushing. [00:24:00] And yeah, just that, that\u0027s that environment that I think so many people can relate with, even like a work culture, you know, like, just like. Work cultures can be like that too. And I think it\u0027s safe for us to say, well, then that\u0027s an unhealthy work culture. We\u0027re allowed to say that, like, we don\u0027t have to just say, this is just normal. This is just the way it is. Like, no, we can say that\u0027s toxic. Like that\u0027s not a, not a helpful environment. Did you have any else thing else you wanted to say just about Impact on you, the CPTSD, PTSD, like how is that showing up for you? Sarah: Yeah, I mean, again, different stages. There was a time at the beginning where I couldn\u0027t sleep, I couldn\u0027t eat, I lost a ton of weight. I was just like, I was, Nippy called it sniper mode. We were just so hypervigilant. Yeah. I didn\u0027t know if we were being, you know, like, you know, spied on, if they were coming to get us. We just, yeah, we were a mess. That didn\u0027t last too, too long in the scheme of things, but I\u0027m still a little [00:25:00] jumpy. Yeah. Like if, you know, it\u0027s so funny. I just said that my husband just made a loud nose in the kitchen and I was like, what was that? Like, you know, I\u0027ve been broken into. So, you know, things like that. My trust in humanity is definitely restored. Like, it\u0027s amazing how, when we stepped away from that. That world, all these incredible people sort of showed up and you\u0027d think maybe I wouldn\u0027t trust them right away. But I was like, I, I felt the difference to like a good versus, I wouldn\u0027t say bad person, but like, you know, I just, some, some angels showed up and kind of swooped us up and took really good care of us, especially the people that made the vow. Like that was a really wonderful experience and that impact of doing the vow. You know, that could have, that could have gone so many different ways. Like that could have, that could have been a shit show for us. And it wasn\u0027t. And like you said, you\u0027re, you and your friends were listening and watching going, have you seen the vow? I can tell you, I still get messages from people in all different groups and relationships, mostly things like different [00:26:00] religious offshoots or like particularly closed communities or like the Jehovah\u0027s witnesses, a ton of Mormons message, the Mormons especially were like, Oh my goodness, we were in lockdown watching tiger King. And then we were watching the vow and they\u0027re like, Holy shit, we\u0027re, you know, in a really not good situation. So that, that continues to be very rewarding for me. And, you know, I think that if had there not been so many silver linings from this experience. You know, I don\u0027t know if I would have like recovered like I, it was, it was such a, I didn\u0027t mention this before the betrayal, the betrayal wound is one of my, one of the things in my, my therapist, I call it therapist Dan Shaw helped me with and who\u0027s a, who\u0027s a narcissist expert really helped me see is that when you\u0027re people that you trust betray you on that level, it can be a wound that is, takes a while to heal. And these were like. People I considered family who knew what Keith was up to and they were lying to us. And that\u0027s something that I never, you know, [00:27:00] and I always say we underestimated people\u0027s capacity to lie. We just totally took things at face value. Oh, Keith is celibate. Oh, okay, cool. He doesn\u0027t need sex. Great. What are all these women around him? Oh, that\u0027s part of his team. Like, okay. mean, it\u0027s so obvious and I feel probably like I was very naive. Now, but, Katherine: and, yeah, I\u0027m a trusting person, go into relationships thinking, oh, they\u0027re lying to me. Yeah. Most Sarah: people don\u0027t. Yeah. But I do, what I do know now, and I see in almost every group, there\u0027s some term for it, which is basically like in a group like ours and every, every group we\u0027ve looked at, there\u0027s this sort of. Belief that it\u0027s okay to lie for the greater good, and it\u0027s okay to lie to protect the leader. Or, you know, for, there\u0027s some other greater reason it\u0027s okay to say, you know, no, we\u0027re not doing X, Y, and Z if it means to, to print like. The big picture. It\u0027s okay. The ends justify the means. Katherine: Yeah, that ends justify the mean things. Means [00:28:00] thing. You said that people came in like as you were leaving and kind of supported you and you said it felt different. Can you describe what that different feeling was? I mean, there was just no manipulation. Like I remember once having a conversation with, it wasn\u0027t even my therapist, just somebody who\u0027s a, who was a family friend who was a therapist. And I had shared briefly sort of what had happened and his first response was, wow, that sounds like. Sarah: That sounds really horrible. It sounds really hard. Mm-Hmm. And, and then I was like, whoa. Because in nex Im, if I shared, shared something that bad that had happened, the an the question would be, you know, well, how did you cause that? Mm-Hmm. , and you know, what, you know, or, or, or, how did you author that? Or, what\u0027s your responsibility in it? Mm-Hmm. . Or what\u0027s missing in you that you felt like you needed to create that? Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So all that kind of bullshit was, really upsetting. Katherine: It sounds like they believed Sarah: [00:29:00] you. Yeah, they believed me. Yeah. And that\u0027s, that\u0027s the thing. And also, I had a lot of moments like that where I was like, whoa. That other way was actually really bad. And I had no idea how toxic it was until I was No longer dealt with that way. Katherine: Yeah. Yeah. And in the church world, it\u0027s called the, the, the reverse of that is like, well, what\u0027s your responsibility or, you know, why don\u0027t you give, or you\u0027re being bitter or you\u0027re angry or whatever. And then, and then they\u0027ll call that accountability and character development and, and it\u0027s framed as this like good thing. When it\u0027s just. Invalidation and bypassing. Sarah: Yeah, I definitely see that in almost every religion is that people are shamed into like to not express a concern because then they\u0027re then they\u0027re complaining or they\u0027re stinking thinking or it\u0027s negative or whatever. So they learn to not say it so there\u0027s no there\u0027s no place to bring forward a concern. And that\u0027s a that\u0027s a really that\u0027s a [00:30:00] really, you know, great protective mechanism for somebody who\u0027s a. Cult a hole. Do you know what I mean? Like, or somebody who\u0027s just being a, you know wants to abuse power or do bad things if there\u0027s no place for the people around them to, to question it or say, you know, is this good or is this bad? Then that\u0027s, that makes the, the clo we call it the closed loop system, right? Katherine: Mm-Hmm. . Yeah. And all of the accountability is like outward towards everyone else, but then that like, yeah. Leader or leadership doesn\u0027t, it doesn\u0027t, they don\u0027t play by the same rules, Sarah: like, right. Well, that, and that was something also that I saw as a consistent thing is that all of the dogma and, and, you know, there\u0027s like a lot of great truth to taking responsibility for things that happen in your life and that\u0027s, it can be a good thing, but if it\u0027s always. It\u0027s always your fault. And the other person didn\u0027t have any responsibility. Then, and that\u0027s, that\u0027s something I say all the time. Wait, especially in XM. There\u0027s no victims and you create everything in your life. Now, Keith is in jail. And he\u0027s the [00:31:00] victim. Like he\u0027s the victim of the like, Oh, the FBI plan. Oh, the FBI must have planted evidence. Oh, but, but Keith, how did you cause this? How did you get yourself into jail? Like, where is that? Where is it now? Where is it now? You know, and that, that\u0027s, that\u0027s such a huge inconsistency and inconsistencies are something that if you, you know, you bring up then you\u0027re. Not trusting the process or in the yoga communities, like you have resistance. What\u0027s with your resistance? Katherine: Oh my goodness. Wow. Yeah. Like the inconsistency thing in the as a, as a red flag is, is something that\u0027s It seems to happen a lot. And these groups, there\u0027s a, there\u0027s a double standard where there\u0027s between two different people or it\u0027s between the leadership and everyone else or whatever. That double standard inconsistency is definitely something that pops up I would love to hear from you just a little bit about. Recovery has been like, [00:32:00] and what are things that have helped you? Sarah: Again, different stages. I think the biggest part of my recovery at first was just talking about it and being with other X members and being able to speak freely without the shackles of the language constraints to be able to say, Oh, Oh, remember that time when so and so did this. That was a really mean thing to do. We never could have talked that way because that would have been. You know, breaking rank and, you know, all sorts of rules, broken images, expressing that way. And I didn\u0027t realize how suppressed I was. I couldn\u0027t go up line in my, in the authoritarian, you know, thing because they didn\u0027t get in trouble. And if I went down, that\u0027s bad leadership. So I was kind of like, you know, hogtied. I could talk to my husband, which is, I think, kind of a rare situation. And most people in my situation, we just couldn\u0027t talk to anybody. And also Mark Vicente, who was the person who brought me in. If you\u0027ve seen The Vow, he\u0027s the director that. That brought me in, but also got me out. So speaking about it, and then you know, Reclaiming my time educating [00:33:00] myself. I did a lot of watching of other documentaries and podcasts and movies and all sorts of things that really helped me connect the dots. And I have notes from my early days of watching movies like going clear and Scientology or holy hell about Buddhafield and just seeing. Like, holy shit. This is the, it\u0027s, it\u0027s the exact same. Like really even in our podcast, every time we interview someone, it\u0027s like the, it\u0027s the exact same template. Yeah. I mean, some of the content, yeah, some of the content points. It always the same school and learned. We did the same school, even like with holy hell, the leaders doing this, forced ballet classes and with us it was volleyball. But it\u0027s the same kind of like obsession with this one thing. Physical, yeah. Just yes. And like, you got to get this thing right, but the performance and the adulation of the leader and all that stuff. So that was really helpful. And then there\u0027s a lot of things that I\u0027ve done, I guess. So therapy wise at different stages, having an actual cult therapist was really helpful for me. And I saved a lot of time there because not only did he understand the dynamics, but he actually already knew [00:34:00] Nexium, which was great. So if I said, well, Nancy did this to me once, or Keith said this to me or whatever, he knew what I was talking about. Having a psychologist that didn\u0027t have cult training was laborious, but also really helpful because I would have to explain things that, that I realized, like, as, as explaining it, I was out of deprogramming myself. You know, in one particular moment I was saying to him, Oh, well, in our, in our belief system, we. Believed that needs were like survival based, you know, air, shelter, water, whatever. And anything else was considered a desire and therefore a non integrated fixation. You need to work on like, why did you think you needed this thing to be okay? Love, connection, community, blah, blah, blah. So then he, I remember, cause he didn\u0027t know anything about cults and he was like, well, those are needs to survive. But what about needs to thrive? And I was like, Oh, they didn\u0027t want us to thrive. And I always thought that the people in Albany who live there look fricking miserable. And I was like, [00:35:00] that\u0027s why they were miserable. They weren\u0027t allowed to have a career or relationship because then they were, they were shamed into like, that that was just a deficiency based desire. In other words, there\u0027s something wrong with you that you\u0027re even searching. Like, why do you even need that from the outside world to be complete? So that was you know, an interesting process to have a you know, a cult. A therapist and then a regular therapist, but I think a lot of my therapy came from just talking and educating myself and talking to other survivors. And then there\u0027s a whole series of things that I\u0027ve done and continue to do. Like I\u0027m, I do yoga, but I do like a not culty yoga. Like there\u0027s no dogma. There\u0027s no education. There\u0027s no leader. There\u0027s no, it\u0027s just more of like a fitness thing. Because that\u0027s how I protect myself, like I don\u0027t do kundalini or, yeah, like that. I walk a lot, you know, after this podcast, I will walk and, and like, clear my mind. Some like sort of spiritual, somebody, some might say woo woo practices that I do, but there\u0027s no It\u0027s not, it\u0027s not like a [00:36:00] tied to a certain school or program. It\u0027s just like a little practice here, a little practice there. I take my green juice. I\u0027m very health oriented. I\u0027m all about like getting good sleep and all the things that we weren\u0027t allowed. Like I remember when I started Nexium, I was They would say I have, I would have had an attachment to comfort because I was like, I\u0027m getting my eight hours. And they\u0027re like, well, why do you think you need eight hours? And I\u0027m like, well, that\u0027s just what, how I function best. And I\u0027m like, why do you think that would if it\u0027s a limiting belief? And by the end of it, I was having like four or five hours of sleep a night to prove to them how much sleep I didn\u0027t need and how I could be like such a bad ass, you know, but really I do need, like I, I do best on as much sleep as I possibly can get. So prioritizing that and prioritizing what\u0027s right for me and not going with somebody else. Going on what somebody else says is right for me has been also huge. A lot of baths. I take Epsom salt baths for my CPTSD almost every night. Putting a lot of money on hot water. I\u0027m sure. Katherine: Hey, it\u0027s very sensory and it like, yeah, it\u0027s you and [00:37:00] your body. It helps you be present. It\u0027s Sarah: yes. Yes. And you could cut this out if you want, but I also microdose psilocybin a fair bit, which also does, does all of those things keeps me, my body has to be present. I don\u0027t get, I\u0027m not doing it to hallucinate or get high on mushrooms, but it just helps me not be anxious. Yes. So yeah, that\u0027s, that\u0027s kind of, those are my main, lots of variety. Yeah. Lots of variety. And oh, and hiking, I like love being in nature and that\u0027s like super important to me. I try to get out at least once a week. Katherine: What would you say this is something that like is I think just like a constant question that a lot of folks have and something that I\u0027m, I\u0027m kind of exploring as well is like the difference between having someone help you like a therapist and like that language versus a guru who was like telling you what to do and like, what does it feel like to have that difference. Or what does that difference feel like? [00:38:00] Sarah: Yeah, I\u0027d say that that like a healthy therapist feels like they\u0027re on a journey with me and they\u0027re just, , questioning and , it\u0027s like they\u0027re going down in the cave with me. We\u0027re both shining lights and we\u0027re looking together. Whereas the, the guru approach or, you know, like an axiom, I always felt like there was literally like a. Such a power power difference. Like I\u0027m sitting down here and they would be sitting up there like even the seats were raised and we\u0027re kind of looking up at and tell me what to do, like, what do you think and Reclaiming that has been definitely been a huge part of my healing. Katherine: Yeah, so the guru is more like the expert Mm hmm or life telling you how to do it Sarah: And I have to be so careful with that too, because I do love to give people unsolicited advice. You know, especially in our podcast. I do like to be Katherine: like, that\u0027s not a good thing. Don\u0027t do this. Sarah: And I\u0027m like, you really need to be taking more baths. Okay. I\u0027m just kidding. But I\u0027m like, well, what, how do I try to phrase it now? I was like, this is what\u0027s worked [00:39:00] for me. This is what works for me. And you can do whatever you want. I don\u0027t care. Katherine: Yeah, no, I like the phraseology. I have to do the same thing. It\u0027s like, well, you know, I have that same situation and this is what I try. Yeah. Do with that what you\u0027ll exactly. Yeah. And then that would be as opposed to someone who is like, partnering with you in this journey and, and just like being empathetic to the experience rather than telling Yes. That they know better what you need than you do. Yes. Yeah. Exactly. I love that. That\u0027s great. Any, any final things that you would like to share as we wrap up put all of your information in the show notes, but if you have any information that you want to give folks about how to interact with you, Sarah: I mean, I\u0027d say like if they want to know the full story, my book in combination with the vow, I think is a really good balance because the vow has my story, but also massive gaps in some things that happen. But the vow [00:40:00] has a lot of other people\u0027s stories. And if you want to go down an axiom rabbit hole, there\u0027s tons of other memoirs out there. But I think that our podcast I\u0027ve, I\u0027ve been told is very therapeutic for people of all different groups, religions you know, even abuse situations because you\u0027re hearing the stories from different, different people\u0027s perspectives that. You\u0027re not maybe necessarily as attached to like defending or being protective of your group, whatever that is. So when you hear when other people\u0027s stories, you\u0027re like, Oh yeah, I relate to that. And it can be, well, it\u0027s free. It\u0027s free therapy. So not that it\u0027s not in lieu of therapy. I\u0027m not saying like, don\u0027t do therapy, but it\u0027s gonna be a bonus. And I also say, like, there\u0027s some episodes that will resonate and some that won\u0027t. Just skip them. You don\u0027t have, you don\u0027t have to listen to all of them. If it\u0027s something that that, that is resonant for people, there\u0027s a, we\u0027re also on Patreon and we do a lot, we do another bonus episode every week. And that\u0027s more casual. And we answer questions from the audience. We do voicemails. And we also have a Goodreads account. I recommend a lot of books [00:41:00] and I interview a lot of authors. So all of the books that we love are on our little bit culty Goodreads account. And I think the best way if you want to just reach out to me personally is on my Instagram. I, I answer every message. A little bit culty is a little bit backlogged, but people can check us out there as well. And if they want to be a guest, a little bit culty, they can apply through our website. Oh, the one thing I would say also that\u0027s really cool, I think that I did recently is a TEDx talk. I don\u0027t know if you had a chance to see it or hear it. Yeah. It\u0027s 15 minutes of like the summary of why people need to educate themselves about cults. It\u0027s very, it\u0027s like a lot. It\u0027s like some people call it the best of a little bit culty in a very short period of time. So it\u0027s a lot of quick nuggets. Yeah. And I think, I think your community would like it. Katherine: That sounds good. I might reach out to you. I might reach out to you later about that because a couple of years ago I had talked to someone about doing a TEDx talk about spiritual abuse and they kind of discouraged me from [00:42:00] it because it\u0027s supposed to be inspirational and it didn\u0027t, they\u0027re like, Sarah: that\u0027s inspirational. Well TEDx actually has some kind of like a little bit quality rules. Like you can\u0027t talk about politics or religion. Okay. It\u0027s in, it\u0027s in their rule book. But. So talking about spiritual abuse, I don\u0027t know how you would frame it in a different way. You have to frame it in a different way. Yeah. Go ahead and talk about spiritual bypassing and just not mention religion. Ah, Katherine: yeah, that\u0027s true. True, true, true. Cool. Well, thank you so much for giving us your time. I\u0027m excited to just see what, see what develops. Thank you for all the work Sarah: that you\u0027re doing. My absolute pleasure. It\u0027s, it\u0027s a total joy to talk about and I will continue to talk about it until everybody is out. So everyone. Yes. Free the slaves. Katherine: Free the slaves.",

We also discuss the perspectives Catholics and protestants have of one another, the origin of Alcoholics Anonymous (spoiler, it\u2019s Christian), and whether or not AA is a cult.

Hi. These are my two friends that I just met through. That\u0027s a f****d up podcast, and we had a blast hanging out and, and, and interview doing an interview. I had a blast hanging out with them and doing an interview with them.\nAnd so we decided to do this episode. Fallon grew up similar to me in \nevangelicalism and Ashley did not. So we\u0027re going to play a game called Stuff Christians Say, where Fallon and I are going to introduce Christian sayings to Ashley and ask her what she thinks they mean. And this is a like Not a pass fail like no, like there\u0027s, there are no stakes here other than testing your Christian, your Christian knowledge before I, I\u0027m going to play a video, a little video to, to get us warmed up, but before I do that.\nAshley and Fallon. I would love to hear what brings you here today. Ashley, go \nAshley: first. What\u0027s up, Kathryn? [00:01:00] Hey! Super excited to be here. So yeah, I have a podcast called that\u0027s so fucked up and it\u0027s about Colts and murder and other generally fucked up stuff.\nAlthough I would say I primarily focus on Colts and coercive groups and I can high control groups. Obviously that\u0027s more where your podcast and your stories fit into. I saw Jesus camp 17 years ago when it came out in 2006. I saw a bunch of evangelical children being brainwashed at a camp to Take abortion out of the you know, take abortion rights away because a third of their f*****g friends could have been there that night and they weren\u0027t.\nAnd then I saw it 17 years later, like right after our abortion rights got taken away. And I was like, hold on, this is a long game. And then I saw shiny, happy [00:02:00] people and I\u0027ve been obsessed with high control, coercive Christianity ever since. So I\u0027m very excited to have met you through me and Fallon doing a segment called the new f word.\nThe f word was fundamentalism fundamentalism and Actually, it\u0027s really funny or it\u0027s actually really fun the episode that Catherine was on was called the new f word the C and F and E words Which sound like they\u0027re going to be really bad, but it was Christianity, nationalism, fundamentalism, and evangelicalism.\nSo, you know, really, I had a lot of fun. I thought that was fun. \nKatherine: That was one of my funnest, my funnest or most fun. I don\u0027t know. Funnest, funnest episodes that I\u0027ve ever, ever interviewed on. I had a great time with y\u0027all. \nAshley: I wanted to make sure that we knew what the f**k we were talking about before we started [00:03:00] talking about it, because as you said, I have, I am not religious, I did not grow up with any religion, I have a Patreon segment where I learn about the Bible, it\u0027s called Ash Learns the Bible, because I knew about that one story, I think Solomon, where they try to cut the baby in half, and I was like, That is fucked up.\nIs there other shit like that? Because I want to hear about it. So, basically, I guess what I\u0027m trying to say is that Christianity has taken over my life somehow. \nKatherine",

      "description": "Shannon Payton (https://shannypantsshow.com/), known as Shanny Pants by many, is a content creator and podcaster living in Rocklin, California. Although Shannon has a successful career as a Realtor, she has equally enjoyed her hobby of sharing her humor through Instagram with friends and family. In 2020 her video about making school lunches went viral, it opened a whole new world for her. She now has many viral videos and hundreds of thousands of social media followers. Her podcast, The ShannyPants Show is currently in its second season. In her interview style podcast, Shannon shares her struggles of growing up in a cult, battles through years of infertility that ended in a hysterectomy and finally her journey to parenthood through foster care and adoption. She enjoys sharing the struggles of life in a humorous way as part of her self-prescribed therapy and through this, has connected with her fans. Her podcast topics include a wide range of subjects which in one way or another relate to something she has been through. Shannon has been a guest on The Kelly Clarkson show and has appeared on local TV show GoodDay Sacramento multiple times. Shannon is currently writing a memoir and is looking forward to giving her followers a deeper look into her life. When Shannon is asked where she gets all of her ideas for her humorous videos she sarcastically states, \u201CI\u2019m married and have kids, that\u2019s all the inspiration I need for some crazy content\u201D. IG: @therealshannypants @shannypantsshowpodcast Transcript is unedited for typos and misspellings [00:00:00] I\u0027m Katherine Spearing, and this is Uncertain. Do you ever get to a point where everything is just too much and you just need to take a break? That is kind of how I\u0027ve been feeling the past few weeks. Around trauma recovery. And abuse dynamics and sometimes it just gets to be a lot and I just need to take a break. So I had to do that over the weekend a little bit. And this episode, I wanted to put this episode out because, uh, the guest today, Shani Payton is just a super funny human being and is comedian her content on social media is. So funny and keeps me laughing all day long and I thought that this episode was going to be like this really funny episode because we recorded it. I think back in like December and I listened to it and I was like, Oh, it\u0027s not as funny as I thought it was going to be, but there is some laughter. Fear not. [00:01:00] Shani Payton is a comedian and has hundreds of thousands of followers. So, so, so, so funny, but she has a darker origin story. She grew up in a church cult, and she has been on her own journey of recovery and healing, and humor plays a role in our healing process, and we do get to that at the end, but we also just talked about the dynamics of control and the impact that it has on us, it\u0027s just a really great conversation, and I really like Shani a lot. I\u0027m going to link to her website in the show notes so you can follow her on all the things. She also hosts the Shani Pants show, which is a podcast. I was recently on the Shani Pants show, I will link to that episode of my conversation with Shani Payton, also in the show notes. Thanks so much for being here, and if you\u0027re having one of those weeks where you just need to take a break, then you know what? [00:02:00] You should. Take a break. Go for a little walk. Have a sip of water. And if you can take a break. for a couple days, sure, just do it. If you can. I highly recommend it. It\u0027s good to do that. All of the abuse and trauma it\u0027ll still be here when you get back. Pretty sure about that. Alright, so here is my conversation with Shannie Payton of The Shannie Pants Show. Katherine: Hello. Shanny: Oh, it\u0027s so good to see you. Good to see you. I\u0027m so Katherine: excited. Me too. Talk about culty things. Talk about abuse things, but then talk about fun things too and ways that giggling and laughter and jokes help us on this amazing healing process. Where do you hail from right now? Shanny: Northern California, right around the Sacramento [00:03:00] area. Katherine: Yeah. I lived in LA for four Shanny: years, so. Oh, did you? Okay. I\u0027m familiar with the stomping grounds. Oh yeah. Just a quick, you know, nine hour little drive for me. Not Katherine: bad at all. No big deal. No big deal. I know. I know every, every time I moved someplace, people would say, Oh, do you know so and so? Because they like live in the state and it\u0027s like, This is like a massive state. Other than D. C. where people are like, Oh, my friend blah blah blah lives there. Like, D. C. is so big. No, I have not run into them in the grocery store. No. Well, whenever Shanny: someone says, you know, whenever It seems like when people say, Oh, California. Oh, do you surf? And I\u0027m like, no, no, I do not surf. Like, Katherine: like, because Shanny: it\u0027s like how the state is, how long it\u0027s like, I live more up in the mountains. And, you know, versus the coast. And, and then even so there\u0027s. So many different [00:04:00] coasts as far as, you know, all the way down to the Bay Area. Yeah. So it\u0027s funny, but everyone that\u0027s like, Oh, do you surf? No, no, you would not want to see that all the time. Katherine: Right? Yeah. Shanny: Quick, quick little weekend trips Katherine: every, every weekend. Shanny: But yes, but I do love where we live. It\u0027s beautiful. And I, I. Yeah, I really love it. And I grew up here. I\u0027ve never moved far from home, so I\u0027ve always been in the area. Yep. Katherine: Right. All right. Well, I would love to introduce you to folks by hearing your story. The group that you grew up in is very similar to the group that I grew up in with this just very fundamentalist dedication to interpretation of the Bible and I would love to hear what that was like for you growing up and process getting out questioning because you\u0027re [00:05:00] not, you\u0027re not in it now. Right. Right. Right. Shanny: Otherwise I would not be talking to you because you are Katherine: of the world. I am. We could not communicate. No, no eye contact would be happening. So tell me, tell me a little bit about it. I know a lot of folks in our community are going to really Shanny: yes, I, so I was born into this cult religious cult and up in Northern California. My parents were also born into it. So we had some generational, you know, fun things. We\u0027re just dragging around. And, you know, it started out as from as much as I can understand, talking to my grandparents and other older folks it started out as kind of like a, we\u0027re going to go not, not even nondenominational. It was just like, we\u0027re going to do meetings in our home, basically. So I think it started out as a pretty innocent. Kind of fine thing like just Bible studies and in homes and then it\u0027s from what I understand. It sounds like in the [00:06:00] 70s late 70s to 80s The his son is now the current leader, but he took over And we\u0027ll call him RG. He, and from that point on is kind of when it became more rule based, fear based and that\u0027s when kind of there started to be a lot more things that got put into place and people just kind of, I guess, followed along and went with it. And so in the mid, 80s, there was what we call the split of the 80s, where a large group of people were questioning some of the beliefs and rules and restrictions. And there was a, we call it marking to be avoided, but like an excommunication. So there was a large group that were excommunicated from us in the 80s because they were questioning and you don\u0027t do that. And part of my family, Katherine: like in a [00:07:00] group, or was it like, we call you in, into the office Shanny: and it was basically, I mean, I was a kid at the time, but it basically is just public, you know, from the front, you\u0027re hearing, and we had a lot of different sex. So we had like ours up here in Northern Cal, there was four in North, in California. And then we had like Texas, Virginia, Oklahoma, Canada. Mexico. I think that\u0027s all of them. So this message would go to everyone because we would get together. We call them camps where people from all different, what we call assemblies would like beat together and hang out. And so everyone\u0027s getting the same announcement basically that these people are marked you are or not to associate with them. And it truly was like, yeah. Oh yeah. Like announcing their name. Oh yeah. Oh, a hundred percent. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Mark, you Katherine: are Shanny: an announcements today. Katherine: It\u0027s very light. We [00:08:00] just Shanny: have, you\u0027re not allowed to talk to your family again. Oh my God. Yeah. So that happened back in the eighties and I was I was a young kid then and part of my family was marked my dad\u0027s sister and her family which she married my dad\u0027s best friend. So that was like really hard on my parents. Yes. And it sounds like they were kind of. You know, on the cusp of do we be a part of the marked group or not. And of course we stayed. But it was really sad because all of a sudden, and you know, as a young child, I\u0027m not allowed to hang out with my cousins anymore. And I was really good friends with the one that was really close to my age, and it was just really confusing and I remember like even as a child, like, Oh, it was awful and you\u0027re in like life wasn\u0027t confusing enough how we lived. But I just remember like praying like, please help them get right with the Lord because obviously they\u0027ve left the will of the Lord and, you know, [00:09:00] because that\u0027s what we are taught is they\u0027re wrong and they\u0027re sinning. And they\u0027re a part of the world now, so they\u0027re no longer a part of us. What did Katherine: they, did you ever find out what they got marked Shanny: for? You know, I don\u0027t know. It was really about like, it was like legalistic stuff. Like, even like, so we had to wear like skirts and the women. And the men had to wear pants. So we had to just like kind of rules like that. And I know some of it was around that kind of stuff. Just why do we do this? Like, let\u0027s dig in. Why, why are we doing this? So it wasn\u0027t. Katherine: If you can justify it and give me a logical reason, sure. But if you don\u0027t have one. Shanny: Right. Go ahead and mark us, I guess, because that\u0027s what we\u0027re going to do, because we obviously don\u0027t, they didn\u0027t have a reason, you know, it, but that was the thing. You don\u0027t question, you just don\u0027t, you just follow along like we did for so many years. But yeah, so it was just about, it was not about anything crazy, nothing [00:10:00] like nothing serious. And like, Nothing even biblical, I don\u0027t think, you know, it was more like the rule side of things. So, but that was really hard on my family. I know. And yeah. It was really sad, but that\u0027s, but kind of growing up, that\u0027s kind of like a little bit of the background of how this group started. But growing up in it, it was, like I said, it was just a lot of rules, very fear based where like, I\u0027d never went to, we, and we were, so we had no name. Our church group cult had no name. And that was because you wouldn\u0027t, if you follow a follower of God, you wouldn\u0027t. You wouldn\u0027t need a church name. The church is the, the body of people, right? It\u0027s not a building. So we would meet in Grange Halls or people\u0027s houses and we would never take a name, which was really fun explaining to people at school as a kid when they\u0027re like, what church do you go to? And you\u0027re like I don\u0027t know. [00:11:00] Yeah. So we literally had a concerted Katherine: effort to be different. Shanny: Oh, for sure. Yeah. Oh, Katherine: that\u0027s super confusing because you don\u0027t have an identify. No. Wow. Shanny: It was, it was very interesting. So we did grow up. So we would go to meetings at Grange halls in our assembly here. There was, I\u0027m guessing about like 100, 150 of us, maybe in this area. And our assembly, most people were homeschooled. We did go to public school, me and my sisters. And there was a really tiny little public school right by a Grange Hall where we met. And so a couple of the other families went there as well. And it was awful going to school with cult people because they would call you out. Like my parents, we were always in trouble because my parents were a little bit more on the like. Rebellious side, I would say, like my dad would wear shorts at home. They would let us wear pants at home. And [00:12:00] we were like constantly in trouble. It seems like but we did go to school with a couple of other families that went to our meetings as well. Were they reporting you? Yes, they would not only would they report us, but like when we were younger in like grammar school, they one of them was in my grade. So it was a little school. So we all are together. And he would, like, we would be doing like a craft project, like making Santa magnets, because it\u0027s Christmas, we didn\u0027t celebrate any holidays. I probably should point that out. No holidays. Oh, yes. , he would like raise his hand. And be like, teacher, teacher, teacher, Shannon and me cannot make the magnets. And I\u0027m just like, Oh, Katherine: here we go again. So pretty much don\u0027t Shanny: celebrate Christmas. No, so we cannot make felt Santa magnets. Oh, yeah. So that was fun. And then like everything else in grammar school, I and I [00:13:00] was such an uncomfortable child. I was so confused looking back. I know now that I was. I was very anxious and depressed my whole entire years growing up and at the time I just, you know, Oh, I\u0027m shy or whatever. So, but we, so another thing in school though, that\u0027s really fun is because we didn\u0027t celebrate holidays whenever they were like singing songs or because you know how it is like, and maybe it was more that way back when we were in school too, but like you would, the school would sing Christmas carols and put on a little thing for the parents and all that. So whenever they were practicing Christmas carols or any holiday, anything, we, all of the cool people, kids would go to the library and hang out and literally just sit there. Being bored. Just hanging out in the library while everyone else is having fun. And, and we had to do that during sex education as well. Because we, of course, right, Katherine: right, [00:14:00] right. Shanny: Because, because we don\u0027t need to learn about our bodies. Like we are different. Yes, Katherine: exactly. Oh my goodness. And that was awful. Just like, it\u0027s so isolating. Shanny: Oh, so much. So Katherine: much. Contributing to this, like. Set apartness nature that is characteristic of so many cults of like, we are better. Yeah. Oh yeah. We\u0027re gonna do this like separatist thing to like show that we are better. Yep. And it\u0027s not life giving. It is not making your life better. It is simply for the sake of Being separate and, and yeah, and, and separating yourselves from Shanny: the Katherine: world. Everyone. Yes. Yes. The people who are not enlightened. Shanny: Yeah, exactly. Yes. And it was, it was so separate. And like I was saying earlier too, there\u0027s no we didn\u0027t have a name and for us even. All churches were [00:15:00] bad. Like it wasn\u0027t like, Oh, cool. Every, you know, these people are believers, but they just don\u0027t meet with us. No, no, no. Like if they don\u0027t meet with us. They\u0027re doing it wrong and they\u0027re not the right kind of believers. So that was hard to just because again at separation, like I remember one time some of the guys like my age when we were, I don\u0027t even know. Yeah. I guess we were teens cause they would have had to be driving. They went to this teeny tiny church that was like on the way to the meeting hall. They just wanted to like see what the church was like a real church. And they like went in, sat on the back row. And well, someone found out and so they all got rebuked and they had to like, they have to stand up. Like anytime you get in trouble, you\u0027d have to stand up front for going to a church just to Katherine: visit. You just be like, I wonder what a church Shanny: is like. So yeah. So you can imagine all of the [00:16:00] things that Got rebuked from up front. If that got rebuked, it\u0027s always, we would call it like rebuke all we would laugh and be like, Oh, you got rebuked the day. Katherine: Oh my goodness. And, and that\u0027s just, I mean I can imagine you were probably just so terrified, like, Shanny: of Katherine: like getting in trouble. What\u0027s it going to be. And yep. And it sounds like your family wasn\u0027t quite like that, but the community itself was just right. Surveillancy and watching everything you did. Shanny: Very much, very much. And that\u0027s where, and, you know, we had. I\u0027m very thankful for our family like now we\u0027re like, good job dad way to be rebellious because we were raised, you know, people say like how did you turn out normal and I\u0027m like, Thank you for calling me normal. And also our family I feel like how we were raised in our home.[00:17:00] Did. allow us to be somewhat normal. And that\u0027s why maybe we\u0027re normal today. But we, like I said, we would could wear what we wanted at home. We would sneak movies like we, I remember watching Anna Green Gables because no one, we weren\u0027t allowed to watch any TV movies, nothing. So we would do things like that, that. A majority of people would never, ever have done. We went to Disneyland. We\u0027d get in trouble for it, but we would go. So there was some things, yeah, there were some things that we did that I think made us, allowed us to be a little bit more normal, but you still have that influence. And then even when we were doing these normal things, you still have that fear of, well, we\u0027re having fun at Disneyland, but if they find out what\u0027s going to happen, so there\u0027s always that, like, even though you can fully Katherine: enjoy because you\u0027re, you\u0027re having to hide, hide. And yeah, absolutely. [00:18:00] Yeah, I just, I\u0027m really, really curious how Well, first of all, I like relate a lot with the story. There are different flavors of it in my upbringing. We home church most of the time, and there wasn\u0027t like a, you can\u0027t go to church, but there was definitely. This belief that those people were not as solid of Christians as we were and weren\u0027t as on fire for God as we were. And we would go visit churches and no church was ever good enough. And on the way home, we would have roast pastor and my father would just like shred the sermon apart. Like make sure we knew that what was taught there was. Not accurate and not biblical and watered down and whitewashed and that just like very like, oh, we watched films, but there were like so many films that were like off limits. And [00:19:00] so I remember doing the sneaking thing like when I go out of town, I would go to the library and I would like check out all the movies. The more nudity, the better. And I was just like, just like. Get it all in and also just living with terror that they were going to find out. Oh yeah. Having books that I like hid under my mattress and read after I knew my parents were already in bed. So they weren\u0027t going to be like making the rounds to like check in. And not just that fear of like, like what if and about stupid, stupid stuff. Right. Oh yeah, like it was so dumb that that was like a sign of character or your devotion to God like it just it was so dumb. And so I\u0027m curious, you said that it was like the son of like a leader that eventually came to power and started implementing these rules. Do you remember? Like [00:20:00] how he got people because it wasn\u0027t quite so stringent, like how he got people to do that. Was it like a slow accommodation? Do you remember? I, Shanny: I don\u0027t remember because I was very young at the time. I was. Like born during that time. So I don\u0027t remember exactly. I\u0027m sure it was a very slow progression for as many people as they did keep. But like I said, in the eighties, there was that split of where, you know, people were questioning and that was when he had taken over. And so obviously there were enough people that wanted to stand up to him. And then it took, gosh, 30. 20 more years before another group finally decided this is BS and we\u0027re done. So so it was, I\u0027m sure again, I don\u0027t really know, but it sounds like it was a slow progression where, and I think when it very first started, it was so long ago that society was different. You know, it was normal [00:21:00] for women to wear the dresses. It was normal. You know, that was. A normal thing. And then as time moves on and society is changing, we had to stay basically. So it\u0027s like you\u0027re frozen. And, and then I think that\u0027s kind of, I mean, I\u0027m imagining that\u0027s what happened is it kind of, Oh, well, it\u0027s a rule now. So, and so much of around it. And especially when I think about the men that led overall and still are I think it\u0027s a power trip, you know, and they want that control. They want that power. And they\u0027re so prideful that they cannot say, let\u0027s, let\u0027s take a look at that. I don\u0027t know. Yeah, you\u0027re right. Let\u0027s question it. They\u0027re so prideful. And it\u0027s so sad because you think, well, gosh, that was 50 years ago. Can we not take a look at that and maybe dissect it a little and decide should we still believe that? But they\u0027re so afraid to be wrong, I think. And I know that that\u0027s been a big learning thing for me since being out is realizing [00:22:00] how ingrained that is in me. Like So, I\u0027m mortified of being wrong and, and again, I look back to my childhood. I would never speak up in class or, and it was because I was so embarrassed to be wrong. And I think that was a huge, is a huge thing that I still deal with. And then also it taught the opposite, I think of what they wanted us to learn, but it taught us to be super good at hiding things. We were like, like you were saying, hiding stuff under your mattress. It was like, you knew. How to hide things. And it was like, they forced you to be really good at it. And, and then not only were you hiding things physically, maybe, but emotionally you, all you did was stuff. You\u0027re feeling stuff, stuff, stuff, never revealing the true you. And so as an adult, you know, now you\u0027re trying to figure out like, who am I? And, you know, raising my kids different [00:23:00] and It\u0027s, but it\u0027s been hard. It\u0027s crazy how ingrained that is. Like, it\u0027s just, you know, you sit under that. I was 31 when we got out. So 31 years of sitting in those metal chairs. Katherine: Yeah. And the difference for you, as opposed to folks who join cults later in life. And, and this is my experience as well, is you\u0027re trying to rebuild a self. When you never had a self to begin with, and you don\u0027t have this memory of baseline like this thing that I can return to, even though you experienced the trauma of being in that high control group, you\u0027re. Inevitably altered, possibly forever, you, you still have that thing to like, remember, like, I remember what it felt like to have desires and pursue them and to think well of myself and not think, you know, horrible thoughts about myself. But if you never [00:24:00] knew that, it\u0027s hard. It\u0027s really hard to, like, recreate a sense of self Shanny: if you just, yeah, right. Well, and, and even if you did have desires or things you wanted to pursue, it was wrong. So you would feel guilty about having that idea. Like I, women weren\u0027t allowed to go to college and I wanted to be a nurse so bad. And, you know, and that\u0027s something I\u0027ve, I never did. I never followed through with because, you know, by the time I got out, I had kids and, you know, life moves on. But I, you know, it\u0027s, it\u0027s one of those things that it\u0027s like, I felt guilty for wanting to do that. And I knew it wouldn\u0027t happen. Like, but Katherine: so sad. Yeah. And then, and you feel like Things were stolen from you and yeah, just yeah, and I just, I also just like kind of want to go back to you and mention like these men who like can\u0027t be wrong. And I feel like there\u0027s a difference between like those men who can\u0027t be wrong. And, and [00:25:00] fear of being wrong and like that. Yes, you know that I experienced that too. This happened like a few months ago. I\u0027m on an improv team and we had a show and I had a bad show. Like I was really tired. I had something really stressful and work happened like right before the show and it wasn\u0027t a great show and it just happened to be a show where some of my friends came to watch and it was the first time I had friends. Watching and it wasn\u0027t my best show. So it was like this experience of like, wasn\u0027t my best show. This is the first time they\u0027re seeing it. They don\u0027t know that that wasn\u0027t the best thing that I could do. I went on this massive shame spiral for probably 48 hours. And it was really intense. And I knew in my head, this isn\u0027t that big of a deal. Who cares? Have a bad show. Whatever. And it took me a while to unpack just kind of the threads of like, I just grew up in an environment where it was not safe to fail. [00:26:00] And like being wrong was dangerous. And I always felt that way, like, when I was in, like, church situations, and I would get in trouble for something, or get caught out for something, and I would get super defensive, and of course, it\u0027s perceived as arrogance that I got defensive, when in reality, it was a trauma response, and I would hate fighting, or, or flighting. Yep. Because I felt unsafe and I felt it couldn\u0027t, it couldn\u0027t, it wasn\u0027t just, oh, a mistake. Mistakes were dangerous in the world that I grew up in. And, and then there\u0027s the, the very arrogant people who actually can\u0027t be wrong. Right. They\u0027re actually, they\u0027re just, they\u0027re just human beings. Shanny: Right. They just think that they\u0027re above human beings and are better than everyone. Yeah. Yeah. No, I, I liked that you pointed out that difference because. It\u0027s very true. And I think, you know, thinking of like our group and my family in it, there it\u0027s, you were, you were afraid to be wrong. And [00:27:00] someone has asked, I forget who it was, was asking something about like the family dynamic and, and the, and the group dynamic. And it\u0027s almost like it didn\u0027t even matter what your home life was like with what the group was pushing on you. Because It was such a strong, powerful, fear based thing that, because we had, I had a friend from high school that actually ended up joining our group, and And while she was in high school, so this poor girl by herself or with her family by herself. Oh, wow. Yeah. She was having like some, some stuff going on at home and found the group and poor thing. What a disaster. And, and, you know, I know you probably talk about this all the time too, but there always is something or can be something that draws someone in. And like for her, it was that sense of community and the family and the love and dah, dah, dah, everything you see from the outside. Right. That. Besides how we dressed that might be appealing. And and so [00:28:00] she started coming and then within, I mean, honestly, a couple of visits, it was, well, you need to start wearing skirts now and like almost immediately, but I just get so sad for people like that because it\u0027s like. You know, maybe home wasn\u0027t exactly great, but then you come to this other environment that you think is what you need. And then you\u0027re just destroyed, like, yeah, so, so sad how many lives and I mean what they put the, we called ourselves young people, like when we were young teens but what they put the young people through is. Awful. Like the amount of, Oh, they just so fear and shame based like, Oh, but they bring you up front. Like if you were caught for anything, basically bring you up front, rebuke you and you\u0027d have to confess, which never were real, of course, because none of us really, we\u0027re sorry. And just, but yet also [00:29:00] if you had the right last name and you were in the right position. You would be spared from that. So like someone in one of a girl I grew up with, her dad was, you know, on the list of good people or whatever. And she had an affair with a married man outside of our group. And it was pushed under the rug and I\u0027m like, Oh my God. Like, and, and, and there was enough of us that knew about it, that it was so damaging. Like that whole concept of like, Oh, she gets away with it. And yet you\u0027re dragging everyone else up front and making them confess that they. Made a mistake. Like, oh my gosh. So it was very hands at Katherine: home. And yeah, exactly. Oh my goodness. Yeah, because the about like they they\u0027ll say this is about like character and, you know, being a godly person, but really it was about elitism [00:30:00] and controlling people which is I mean, that is what those rules are for. They sell it to you as if it\u0027s for your good, but it\u0027s not. It\u0027s really just to keep you in line and to keep you subservient. Woof! Shanny: Goodness. Yeah, they did, they did, they did real good at that. Katherine: Real good. Yeah. Yeah. And I think that, like, that happens with a lot of folks who have families. Of origin that just aren\u0027t safe and they go to the church, they migrate to the church as like that surrogate family and, and then if they experienced that abuse and that control within that second family, it causes so much damage because most of the time you\u0027re internalizing that and thinking it\u0027s your fault. Like, right. This didn\u0027t work out because of something wrong with me. It didn\u0027t work in my family and it didn\u0027t work in the second family. And it\u0027s just very very shame based and, and [00:31:00] just, and can cause so much damage. And I\u0027m actually kind of sort of researching that a little bit of the difference between Like someone who experiences abuse when they\u0027re an adult in a religious context versus someone who experiences it in a religious context when they came from a family that wasn\u0027t stable and wasn\u0027t safe. And like the impact that that has on their faith experience. Yeah. When they didn\u0027t have any foundation versus having a foundation and, and what are the, what are the chances? Like, like what, and it\u0027s kind of just like abuse in general, if you, except like if you experience abuse as a child, you\u0027re more likely to experience it statistically as you get older. And like, what foundation does a family play? In, in creating someone who retains their faith after abuse versus not anyway, Shanny: [00:32:00] yeah, and it\u0027s so interesting and I think I just did an interview actually the other day with someone who\u0027s probably about 10 years older than me from, from my cult and he joined. And so. He just recently had written a book and so I\u0027m like, I want to have you on the podcast, but I never really knew his story. You know, he was older than me that I\u0027d never, you know, I was a kid or whatever. So it was really interesting, but that\u0027s how it was for him. You know, he was incarcerated at 17, had a really rough, you know, life, met someone from this group. And then what happened is he met a girl who, you know, he falls in love with or whatever. And that\u0027s what made him stay. And so then, you know, 30 years later, three kids, adult kids later, he\u0027s Getting his family out of the cult, you know, so it\u0027s like, and I think so many like that is one of the reasons. And for us, you, you married within your group. It wasn\u0027t like you [00:33:00] went outside of it to get married. And there were a few that came in and it was, I feel so bad for them. And it was so hard. Katherine: The same for the men to like, they were not allowed to marry outside either. Shanny: Yeah, they would marry within. Yeah. Yeah. And. But like, so I was mentioning earlier, we would have these like big camps and so we didn\u0027t celebrate holidays. So anytime there was a holiday, we had to be together as a group. So you know, they don\u0027t want you to be tempted to like, you know, go look at Christmas lights or anything. So we would have these big camps and the, one of the biggest ones was here in California central California. So we would all drive down there. Or fly or whatever, get there. And there\u0027d be like, you know, over a thousand people just having meetings all day, basically. It was awful, awful. I hated it. And, but that\u0027s where you would kind of. Look for your mate, you know, because it was like, and you, and [00:34:00] you would only see these people maybe a couple times a year. So you\u0027re going to lock it down. Katherine: Huh. Huh. Before someone else does. Shanny: Exactly. So it was always like a competition. Like, you know, you\u0027re out there on your roller skates skating around and you\u0027re like, ah, he\u0027s mine. But, but that\u0027s where, at 12 years old, I knew who I was gonna marry. And you, and you did, just because it was like, oh, I like him, he likes me, we connect. And we didn\u0027t date, you didn\u0027t court, you just liked them. So, yeah, and so I got married at 19. I really wanted to be out of high school before I got married, so I was kind of old. At 19, but yeah, but I really want to get Katherine: married before they graduated high school. Oh yeah, yeah, Shanny: like I was engaging Katherine: high school or were they told, you don\u0027t need Shanny: to finish. Well, a lot were homeschooled, so I don\u0027t, they probably just finished early would be my guess, probably but I feel like, yeah, I don\u0027t really know. I know [00:35:00] all the. Yeah. The ones that went to public, I think all finished, but but yeah, so that was fun. So then, yeah, I married young and it was, it was real interesting, real interesting, but yeah. Katherine: What was the role that like Oh, I want to get into the humor stuff. Like we haven\u0027t Oh but was, was there at like, Some kind of camaraderie, simply because you both believed the same things when you got married, or was it like way more complex than they ever gave you credit for? Shanny: Like why we got married? Katherine: Well, I was just kind of thinking about the dynamics after you got married. Shanny: Like, oh, it was, or was it just, Oh no, it was awful. Total disaster. Total disaster. You know, cause you, you live with your parents until the night you\u0027re married. It\u0027s the first night you ever are away from home. So in the preparation, like even, you know, like churches will do like premarital counseling or you know, something to kind of prepare you if it\u0027s like, you [00:36:00] know, like the purity culture and all that. Like, I feel like they still try to prepare you for marriage. We had nothing, nothing. We would meet with the leader a couple of weeks before you got married. They take you to dinner, him and his wife. Give you this little pamphlet that basically, you know, is like, well, as long as the wife submits to the husband, everything goes great. And so like, that\u0027s your, that\u0027s, that\u0027s your sex education right there. Luckily, my parents were way better and did like talk to us, but not a ton. And it was always super awkward. So like me with my kids, I\u0027m like, we talk about everything. Yeah. But, and then they, he would recommend, and this is no joke. That to get a thing of Vaseline. Which is not creepy at all, coming from this old, crusty, nasty person. And did you know why? Katherine: Were you like, why? Yeah, yeah, I, I did, yes. Okay. But, Shanny: but it\u0027s like, that\u0027s it. Like, [00:37:00] for, I guarantee you, a majority of people that got this talk did not know why. Katherine: Yeah. Yeah, exactly. . Mm-Hmm. It\u0027s Shanny: just like, so would I, why would no. Right. Like oh, that seems weird. Mm-Hmm. . Katherine: For my, I know, I know a lot of people from the community that I grew up in knew nothing about anything like that and had. dry sex dry course, you\u0027re supposed to have lube. I\u0027m like, so sad. Like, I\u0027m like, so, so, so, so sad that that was their first experience. You know, just like, Oh, yeah. Yes. But that is really creepy, too. Oh, Shanny: so creepy. So creepy. But yeah, and even as you know, aside from the sex part of it, No, no knowledge of living with another person, even, you know, like you\u0027ve never lived with a roommate and learned how to share, you know, nothing, all the little things. Yes. So it was hell. It was honestly like, and I, we\u0027re still married [00:38:00] which is amazing, but it has not been easy. Yeah. And it has been like, we\u0027ve had to work really hard to stay married. And. And so many have been divorced that have gotten out, you know, that I grew up with and I don\u0027t blame them. Like, I\u0027m like you shouldn\u0027t have ever been married. Yeah. So, I mean, none of us should have. So yeah. So it\u0027s been. Extremely hard. So no, because we were brought up the same way, grown up, did not, did not, we did not, yeah, it did not help here. It was awful. No community, like we did not know how to communicate. And again, you know, when you\u0027re an individual person and we\u0027re talking kids, we were married as kids, you\u0027re, you\u0027re already internalizing everything. And so To all of a sudden start sharing things with someone you didn\u0027t that\u0027s not a Katherine: natural thing to do They wanted you to have like an intimate relationship with your partner or they did. Well, Shanny: I mean, I don\u0027t think they cared They didn\u0027t really care. I don\u0027t think [00:39:00] but like I think as a human you want to I mean, I definitely knew like This isn\u0027t right. Like I want more. I thought, well, you just don\u0027t even know. You don\u0027t know what marriage is going to be like. I had no expectations really, because I didn\u0027t, I didn\u0027t know. So it was rough and it\u0027s been 23 years now, but we made it this far. Katherine: Okay. What do you think? What do you think kept you like preserved? Shanny: Things. Well, for God, I don\u0027t know. Were you attracted Katherine: to Shanny: your spouse? Yes. Oh yeah. Oh, and he is adorable. When we were young, he was so cute. And I mean, he\u0027s very handsome. He\u0027s yeah. And you know what? Honestly, he\u0027s the best one. Like you actually know, we really liked each other and he we\u0027ve always, and this is, I think, honestly, what has kept us together is we\u0027ve always been really good friends. And so like, There was a time in our marriage where it was [00:40:00] just like, okay, maybe, maybe friends is what we\u0027re meant to be. Maybe that\u0027s it. But we\u0027ve always been such good friends. And then, we went through so many other things after we were married. Like, we did like, went through like, three years of infertility treatment. And then we ended up adopting our kids. And those were very traumatic experiences, both of them. And, so, I think Because we had so much other trauma happening, we kind of clung to each other because of that, but I would say it never was like our marriage was awesome during that. It wasn\u0027t like, Oh, I feel so supported. It was like, when I look back, like on the years of infertility, I felt very alone, very alone, even from him, because we didn\u0027t know. Like that was years into being married. We still did not know how to really love each other, you know? So I think it\u0027s only been probably the last. And it\u0027s been four or five years that we really finally [00:41:00] put in the work and made some new commitments to each other and decided, okay, it\u0027s either we\u0027re done or we need to make some changes. So, and we have and we, we\u0027re happier now than we\u0027ve ever, ever been. So that\u0027s great. And I\u0027m so thankful for it. And he\u0027s such a good dad. And so. Yeah, now, now everything\u0027s great, but it took us, you know, almost 20 years to get there. Katherine: Yeah, yeah. Thank you for sharing that because I know it\u0027s a vulnerable thing to talk about. Yeah. I feel like I\u0027m encountering more and more stories like that where it ends or there\u0027s this really difficult period where they\u0027re like assessing like. Yeah, yeah. It\u0027s going to work right in your conditioned marriage is what you\u0027re going to do. And then you do really young and you have kids really young. So then you\u0027re like really locked in and, and a lot of your choices get taken away. And so having to [00:42:00] like, Make those choices once you\u0027re already in it it\u0027s really excruciating. So thank you very much for, for sharing. And then as we have a little bit of time left, I really want to talk about by it was so fast and I was so enthralled and kept asking questions. Yeah, I want to know the role that humor played in your journey and continues to play and your healing journey, recovery journey, your escape journey. Did it play a role in your escape journey? Shanny: So not so much. But I\u0027ve always been like my mom\u0027s a real funny person. So like when we would do I\u0027m going to try to keep this fast, but when we would do like camps and stuff, we would put on skits. We always got in trouble because we pushed the envelope, you know, like we always did, but we were, we were like kind of the funny ones, but it was always still so fear based. Cause I remember you\u0027d be so nervous up there knowing what you\u0027re going to do is hilarious. And then no, you\u0027re going to get talked to afterwards because you went too far. But so we were always kind of the funny ones. And [00:43:00] Like me and my mom and there was a little group of us, but then when it, when it was time to get out, basically what happened then it was not humor, it was a group of like pretty much our age people and then a lot of our parents started questioning thing like back in the 80s and we pushed harder. And so. Basically, the cult broke apart, a majority left, they\u0027re still, they\u0027re still continuing on a little bit everywhere, but a majority of the cult broke apart and we slowly just kind of, everyone went their own ways, kind of. Yeah. So, it was more of a. Just disintegration of it than anything else. Luckily my whole family is out. My husband, his parents are still in, so that\u0027s a little weird. But, but yeah, and it\u0027s still causing so much damage. Like it\u0027s absolutely disgusting. So hard to Katherine: watch. It\u0027s Shanny: awful. It\u0027s awful. But after that, after getting out very confusing, you know, for us, all churches were bad. [00:44:00] So we really didn\u0027t know what to do. You know, you\u0027re kind of just out on your own for the first time as an adult, but not really, because we were so like stunted socially and emotionally. So it was hard. It was a long journey. And it\u0027s been 11, 12 years now. And so it\u0027s been a long journey. And like I said, we really have just dug in the last like four years as far as doing some real healing. Yeah. On ourselves and on our marriage, but humor, you know, I\u0027ve always been kind of this funny ish person and I really started, it was during COVID really when I started doing Tik TOK, Instagram, these like little videos and stuff, and I started feeling a little bit more confident and a little more free with doing it. And I had always felt even a little bit uncomfortable. What\u0027s the word? I don\u0027t know, even for my husband to see because again, we, you know, we went, but we had just been through this like big, huge, like, we\u0027re going to make some changes. And so it kind of gave me some confidence, like, [00:45:00] Oh, he doesn\u0027t really care. Like even if he doesn\u0027t think it\u0027s funny, he doesn\u0027t care. So it gave me that boost to start doing that. And as I was. And I realized doing these videos and connecting with people online, I realized how much, how healing it was for me and, and it, you know, and I really, at first, didn\u0027t think of it that way. It was just like, yeah, let\u0027s do this. It has been the, like, such a huge part of my healing at this point, just realizing, like, yeah, we\u0027ve dealt with a lot of shit over the years, like, a lot, but it doesn\u0027t mean we have to live the rest of our lives, you know, depressed and sad, and I deal with a lot of A lot of a depression a lot, but, but I, this, the humor drags me out of it, you know, and it\u0027s like having other people kind of validate like, Oh, you\u0027re funny. It\u0027s not like I, in a, like, Oh, I need to be validated kind of way, but it [00:46:00] just, it prompted me to continue. And You know, and now I love it. It\u0027s what I, and then I just, you know, it brought me to connect with people like you. I mean, I never would have been connected with so many of people I call friends now if it weren\u0027t for that. And it really connected me to like so many others in cults and from high control groups. And I\u0027ve created these like amazing relationships and. Support and people like you that I can listen to and that help with the healing and the growth part of this journey, because it sucks, but the humor we, we have to laugh, Katherine: we have to laugh. Shanny: Yeah. I just can\u0027t even imagine not. Because it would not be good. Katherine: Yeah. And I love that you highlighted the connection that the humor provides, because I think the humor is great no matter what, but when you\u0027re laughing with someone, that like connection and that intimacy that is created when you\u0027re laughing [00:47:00] together, like that is so special. And I think, I don\u0027t know if this was your experience, but I, I just remember times laughing. Afterwards, after like leaving an abusive church now like five years ago, I guess and like laughing and having this belly laugh and then just being surprised. That I was able to laugh and like, Oh, I haven\u0027t done that in a really, really, really long time. Like, I didn\u0027t really remember that I could do that, could access that. And it\u0027s so, it\u0027s so freeing in and of itself and so healing to be able to access that. And. And I, I, I also think like, I don\u0027t know if this was your experience growing up, but we, we were so conditioned to be working on ourselves. Was that part of your upbringing? Like be better, be a better [00:48:00] person. Like really? I don\u0027t, I think it was more, just listen, just listen to me, please just listen and do whatever Shanny: they wanted you to be a good Christian, you know, like you need to be A good example in the world. You should always be an example for anyone in the world that sees you. So, I mean, I guess a little bit. Yes. Katherine: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think that that can like translate to trauma recovery of like, Oh, I need to always be healing. And I need to always be doing these things that will help me heal. And we need to take a Shanny: break. Yes. Thank you for saying Katherine: working on ourselves. Have a good time. Shanny: Thank you. Yes. And it\u0027s so true. And like, even part of that is the whole, like, goes back to the perfectionist part and being afraid to do anything wrong and, you know, being defensive and all of that. You\u0027re right. It\u0027s like, sometimes I, I want to be so good at healing, you know, I\u0027ll even have therapy sessions where I\u0027m just like, Oh, [00:49:00] no, everything\u0027s great. How are you? You know, Katherine: she\u0027s like, nope, this is your turn. And I\u0027m like, great, that was your day. You got nothing today. Like, Shanny: cause I just want to be a good therapy goer, you know? Katherine: I just want to be good at it. I want to be her favorite client. Shanny: I do. I want to be teacher\u0027s pet. Oh my gosh. Yeah. No, no, no damage done here at Katherine: all. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. Well, I\u0027m really glad that we got to laugh together too. I know. Chatting. It has been, it\u0027s been really fun. And I\u0027m, I\u0027m really glad that we met. Me too. In person. Shanny: I know. We\u0027re gonna do it again. Katherine: Together. So it was real, like it Shanny: really happened. It really did. I\u0027m Yeah, that was amazing to meet you and so many others. I like, I just treasure that whole weekend. I was just like, Oh my gosh. It was so good. Katherine: It was so [00:50:00] good. It was such a great weekend. It\u0027s like, I still like, even now, got a little ball of sunshine in my, in my heart at the moment. But, and for folks who don\u0027t know what we were talking about. Yeah, sorry. The fact that Tears of Eden had a retreat con. I got out, had a story jam. We kind of meshed them on the same weekend in St. Louis. That\u0027s where I met Shani in person. Yes. And we have been the best of friends ever since. Shanny: And forever more. Yeah. Forever more. As long as I\u0027m the favorite. You know, I Katherine: have to be the best. I have to be the best. Yes. We\u0027ll sign a contract later. Okay. Perfect. Oh, I love it. Goodness. All right. Well, I\u0027m gonna end this interview. All right. Thank you so much.

Hello. How are you? How are you hanging in there? I hope you\u0027re doing okay. I\u0027m doing semi okay. It\u0027s been a lot inundation with this very real, very damaging type of abuse. One thing that you may or may not know is folks who have experienced spiritual abuse and folks who have experienced sexual abuse. They\u0027re very similar to each other. Spiritual abuse and sexual abuse are very, very similar. The impact is very, very similar because it is so, so vulnerable. You are so vulnerable when this happens and it violates our intimacy and it violates our very souls in a way that maybe other abuse doesn\u0027t. So if you are traumatized. By the abuse that you experienced in a church [00:01:00] or a high control environment or religious environments in your family. There\u0027s a reason for that. It makes a lot of sense. It\u0027s very, very serious trauma. So one of the things that we discussed in this episode is how the folks who. experience sexual abuse when they go to the religious institution where they experience that abuse and say, Hey, help me, this happened, this was awful, please help me. When they get dismissed or falsely accused or sidelined or silenced, that that is sometimes worse than the sexual abuse that they experienced in that institution. This episode is with Marie Griffith. She is the author of Moral Combat, How Sex Divided America and Fractured American Politics. It\u0027s an intense book. A lot of research went into this book. She\u0027s also a scholar [00:02:00] and a professor of religion at Washington University. And one of the things we will also discuss in this episode is how she literally taught a class on abuse in the church in a secular university. What? Crazy, crazy, crazy. Great conversation, lots of mind blowing moments about the connection between sex and sexual abuse and the rampant abuse that is happening in the evangelical church right now. Enjoy, or don\u0027t enjoy, but take it in for sure. And as always, take care of yourself, get some rest, give yourself some time after this episode to go for a walk, take a sip of water, breathe. You\u0027re okay, wherever you are, you are okay, take a deep breath, you are safe, you are here, you are now, you are present, you\u0027re going to be okay.[00:03:00] Here is my interview with Marie Griffith. Katherine: Hi, Catherine. Oh, how are you? How are you? And I have your big book here. This was a lot of work. She took this. Marie: And that was like I don\u0027t even want to tell you how many years. I mean, it was really sort of 15 years. I did other things as I was doing that, Katherine: but yeah. Yeah, just like the amount of research that went into just like one chapter I was like, this was a very large endeavor. But how are you this morning? How are you doing? How is your writing? Is it like a writing sabbatical? Is that kind of what this season is called? Marie: Yeah, I\u0027m on, I\u0027m on research leave. You know, it\u0027s just a standard leave that scholars get every few years. So but yeah, it\u0027s focused on working on this book about sexual clergy, sexual Katherine: abuse. Oh, my gosh. Did I know that? Did you tell me about that? I don\u0027t know if I knew from Marie: that [00:04:00] I had taught that course on the abuse crisis in modern Christianity. And so the reason I taught the course was because I started doing research on clergy sexual abuse in both the U. S. Catholic Church And evangelical groups, particularly the Southern Baptist Convention, although not only Katherine: the Southern. Okay. I don\u0027t know if I knew that the book itself was about clergy sexual abuse. So I definitely want to hear so much about that. Really excited to talk to you. I\u0027m just like, as I\u0027m like reading this book, I\u0027m like, okay. We just need to be friends because I like everything that you research and everything that you\u0027re, I\u0027m like, it\u0027s all like stuff that I\u0027m like thinking about constantly. And then just like even reading your book. And then when Megan told me that she literally had a class on like abuse that is happening in the church, I was like. Wait, who, like, led this? Whose idea was it to have this class? Like, tell me, tell me so much more. And so that\u0027s why I was, like, very [00:05:00] interested to talk to you. And so I would just love to hear very just to start how you got into doing what you\u0027re doing and how this became important to you. Marie: Sure, sure. Yeah. And thank you so much. I really love your podcast and admire the work that you do too, Catherine. So thank you. Well, I am from Chattanooga, Tennessee originally. I was raised Southern Baptist. I grew up in the 1970s and 1980s. So as you may know, that was a time of just tremendous change in the culture, but also for Southern Baptists in particular, and within evangelical Protestantism more generally. The church I grew up in was a really, I thought of it as just a very kind of, you know, ordinary. Church, it was 1st Baptist Church Chattanooga, you know, the kind of flagship Southern Baptist Church of the city. But the, the kind of tensions in the Southern Baptist Convention. Between, [00:06:00] you know, for shorthand, let\u0027s say the fundamentalist and the moderates, because that\u0027s, you know, what they called each other, at least at the time was really strong. And my mother was the pastor\u0027s secretary over a number of years, and she cared deeply about these issues. My dad was the deacon chair for a number of years. So this was dinner table conversation. What was happening within the denomination and. My parents were both moderates. And so I kind of heard that side of it. And it was really painful. A lot of the pastors that I had that worked at our church felt very betrayed by things that happened, convention politics and all of that. And when I left for college, I thought I left it all behind. I mean, it was really painful enough that I just turned my back on a lot of that. But I found myself studying religion and really sort of wondering how all of that came to be. So in some ways, I mean, I think that has, explains a lot about my career, why I became a [00:07:00] scholar of American religion. I\u0027ve focused on evangelicals. I focused on women. I focused on debates over women\u0027s roles, sexuality, and sex. And now clergy sexual abuse. So it really is. There\u0027s a personal story behind that, as I think it is for so many scholars. Katherine: Absolutely. And then have you been able to trace? So you\u0027re working on a book right now about clergy sexual abuse. And then your book that I was reading before we interviewed. Moral combat. The subtitle is how sex divided American Christians and fractured American politics. Have you been able to trace? The link from this divide to clergy sexual abuse, is that pretty, a pretty clear link for you? Marie: I think so. And, you know, I, critics may argue with me, and they have every right to argue with me, but what I see from the sources, the [00:08:00] long historical sources that I\u0027ve looked at over many archives that really begin in the really the late 19th century, but certainly by the 1920s and the birth control movement has been a real power struggle within American Christianity, Catholicism as well as, as, as Protestantism, I should say over leadership, over theology, and maybe more than anything else over the appropriate role of women and, and how to think about gender, how God created men and women. and what their appropriate roles are supposed to be. I think we can see that debate starting with The birth control movement, really going back before that, but my book started with the birth control movement, moving through debates over literary censorship sex education in the public schools, homosexuality, same sex rights, abortion, reproductive rights, sort of all the way through. And so, you know, that\u0027s, that\u0027s an [00:09:00] oversimplification to some degree, but I do think that those wars over sex. over gender, over, over women and, and women\u0027s roles in the public sphere and in the family explain an awful lot of our conflicts culture wars conflicts as they are. And, and I do think that\u0027s what\u0027s led us to the current moment and the, the real fervor over clergy sexual abuse. Katherine: Yeah, and just all of it packaged together when you, and when you put sex sexual abuse itself, and you, and you realize that sexual abuse itself is really not about sex, it is about power, and you, and you see the power dynamic happening in these debates, and like, it\u0027s about who\u0027s going to get it. To be in charge, basically and, and then you add that in with this dynamic of sexual abuse happening and like less about just [00:10:00] urges that need to be fulfilled, but more about like who gets to be in charge and who gets to have a say and who gets to decide. It makes so much more sense through that lens than just like. Sex addiction which is what it sometimes gets boiled down to, but it\u0027s, but that\u0027s, it\u0027s way more than that one. It\u0027s something this rampant. And so I see the connection. And it\u0027s, it\u0027s, it\u0027s pretty, it\u0027s pretty clear to me. But I would love to hear So you taught a class and what was the class called? Can you confirm the name of Marie: that? Sure. Yeah. The class was called the abuse crisis in modern Christianity. Katherine: Okay. And what led you to teaching that class? And then what were, what were the, the, what was the process of getting that class to Marie: be taught? Yeah, yeah, no, and it\u0027s maybe my favorite class I\u0027ve ever taught, so I just want to say that at the outset, which sounds strange [00:11:00] because it was also the most painful class I\u0027ve ever taught, the most difficult class I\u0027ve ever taught. You know, you all, this sort of Me Too, Church Too movement that\u0027s been so extraordinarily important over the last, seven or eight, 10 years, again, going longer than that, even, but really these this past decade. I have so many undergraduate students who have come to me with stories of sexual assault or sexual abuse, and I realize it\u0027s something that college students are grappling with. All the time. But there are, at least in the institutions where I\u0027ve taught, there are almost no classes, you know, that address that it\u0027s it\u0027s sort of we\u0027re expecting our student life personnel and our R. A. S. And people who aren\u0027t even trained in some cases to kind of be the ones to manage. sex on campus or the sexual lives of our students. And so, and as I was doing the research on clergy sexual [00:12:00] abuse and just realizing how rampant some of this has long been and still is, it felt like something that I thought students would take a real interest in. So I taught the course, I put it on the books for fall of 2022. I limited it at first to 15 students and I immediately, when registration opened, it immediately filled up and I had. double that number of students on the wait list. And so I wound up with about 30 students that, that were there off all undergrad, except for one graduate student. And that was, that was Megan. Katherine: And then and so you didn\u0027t have any trouble like hot, like saying, Hey, I want to offer this class. Was that something that you did you have any hurdles with the institution offering the class? Marie: Well, that\u0027s that\u0027s a very good question. You\u0027re the first person to ask me that. As it happened, I was at the time the director of the Danforth Center on Religion and Politics, which is our unit. And [00:13:00] so I was able to just offer the class and it really didn\u0027t go through any kind of Katherine: formal approach. I could do whatever I want. Marie: if I teach the course again, which I definitely plan on doing, it\u0027s possible that I would get some pushback. But the course really it was, it got very high course evaluations. I think the students were saying, these are conversations we all need to be having, and we\u0027re so thankful to be having it. So I think I would be able to make the argument that this is an important course Katherine: to keep on the books. Absolutely. And then you had, I know that Megan had mentioned I think like a former nun and like a former prosecutor that you had in. Was it more of a like a, a workshop style, lecture style, or was it more like you teaching and then you would occasionally have people come in? Marie: Yeah. Well, the course met twice a week for an hour and 20 minutes, and I did very little lecturing. I mean, I would set out the context, you know, for a short period [00:14:00] at the beginning. But as you say, I brought in a lot of experts. I brought in lawyer, a lawyer who has prosecuted these cases and worked a lot with sexual abuse survivors. I brought in Catholic survivors. I brought in a Catholic survivor who is now working for the Catholic church on prevention programs. You know, and has very much considers himself a devout Catholic still archivist, just a whole range of different types of people. We talked to journalists. I just wanted them to really see Things from a wide range of perspectives. I will say that when I started the course, most of my research until then had focused on the Catholic Church. So it was maybe overly focused on Catholicism. And I wish I had had time to do more. with evangelicals, with Mormons their orthodox Jewish cases and coverups of sexual abuse. Muslim communities in [00:15:00] the U. S. have grappled with this. So, you know, it\u0027s almost an overwhelming amount of material and WashU is a very multicultural, multi religious university. So, you know, I think covering these power dynamics, as you say, this is not just about sex, it\u0027s really about power and gender. Covering these across different religious traditions, I think is a really important, Katherine: you know, thing to do. Absolutely. And I still think that the Catholic church is the most well known. I was at a, I was at a class. Sunday night and I had your book with me to just like read while when there was like not stuff going on or while I was like waiting for people and and somebody was like, Oh, what\u0027s, what\u0027s that book about? And so I like, I talked a little bit about the book and then said, I was interviewing someone who taught a class and abuse in the church. And they were like, Oh, like the Catholic church. And I was like, well, I was like actually like I focus on like the evangelical church. And the person that I was talking to you was actually someone who like attends. Church [00:16:00] and and so it was almost like they just like had no idea that that, but that was like happening within the actual like regular everyday evangelical churches, I think a lot of evangelicals will still try to like, think, oh, that\u0027s a Catholic church problem and that happened over there in the Catholic Church, when it is. very rampant in the evangelical church across every denomination. Like I haven\u0027t, I have not met or encountered the denomination yet. That was like, Oh no, we\u0027re good. We don\u0027t have that. That doesn\u0027t, that doesn\u0027t happen. And so I\u0027m really, really grateful that you were teaching that class and just like thinking of the students that got to be in there and be a part of it. And I got to have that conversation. I\u0027m just like. Woo, would I, would I love, you know, I went to seminary and I\u0027m like for grad school and I\u0027m like, would I have loved to have a class like that in seminary? Yes, but they\u0027re not going to have that kind of class in seminary. Like critiquing the church that they\u0027re like creating ministers for. [00:17:00] And, and someone asked me that the other day of like, did you ever have a class on like abuse in the church? And did anyone ever talk about like clergy abuse or spiritual abuse or anything in seminary? I was like, no. It was like it did not exist. It was like that didn\u0027t happen at all. Marie: Well, I think, I think you\u0027re absolutely right. I am hopeful. I feel like in a lot of the conversations that I\u0027m having now, and I, you know, I\u0027m doing interviews with survivors, but also with. Pastors with people working for the church, developing curricula and training programs, you know, for pastors in seminary. I mean, I actually feel some hope that there\u0027s so much energy around bringing some of that knowledge into the seminary classroom requiring. No, in some way, either at the local church level or at seminary. Now it\u0027s difficult because as you know, church autonomy is a hugely important principle for groups like Baptists [00:18:00] and other, a lot of other evangelical groups. And so requiring a church. To have a training or requiring certain courses, even in seminary is it\u0027s it\u0027s hard. And I think a lot of these denominations right now are debating this issue. But still, I think people realize more and more. I mean, the Southern Davis Convention has had Terrible PR over the last several years around its own cover ups of sexual abuse. It\u0027s starting to look as bad as the Catholic Church\u0027s cover up, right? And so I think Southern Baptist leaders I\u0027ve talked to, they know they\u0027ve got to do something. And not just for optics, they\u0027ve really got to do something, you know big to, to bring knowledge to this issue. So I am hopeful that some of that, what you didn\u0027t have in seminary You know, the next generation is going to have some version of Katherine: it, at least. Absolutely. Yeah. Cause I just, I mean, you can\u0027t ignore it at this point. It\u0027s, it\u0027s everywhere. It is everywhere. What was the response? [00:19:00] So you said that you got a really good response from your students in terms of just like evaluations at the end. What was some of like the personal response of students within the class? Marie: Yeah, and I want to say, you know, I gave a lot of trigger warnings at the outset. In the course description, I said, if this is a personal issue for you, Really think hard before you take this class, but come talk to me and I can help you find resources if you want to find resources, but I warned people we\u0027re going to read graphic, you know, accounts of sexual abuse. It\u0027s hard, even for those of us who are not survivors and I do not consider myself a survivor. It\u0027s still it\u0027s grueling. It\u0027s wrenching it. Keeps you up at night when you read the stuff. So I, I really warned students and I warned them on the first day of class and, and all of that nonetheless, you know, kind of midway through, I knew that I had three or four students who were struggling they [00:20:00] were not getting their work in, you know, I reached out to them and they admitted to me, like this was bringing stuff up for them. So I found myself just saying, don\u0027t worry about deadlines. Like take care of yourself, you know, and I told students in class if you need to take a break when we\u0027re in class, you know, I\u0027ve never said this in any other class, but I\u0027m going to tell you now you can walk out and walk around and get a drink of water and come back when you can. And I\u0027m not going to penalize you for that. I, you know, your mental health. is most important here and come talk to me. So students expressed appreciation, you know, in their evaluations that I had been flexible about that as I think anyone should be. One suggestion they did have for me about changing in the future is that my very first minister probably should have been a counselor, probably should have been someone who could come in and talk about trauma and not just the trauma that abuse survivors that we\u0027re reading about have suffered, but trauma that you might feel. You know, absorbing [00:21:00] these stories. And so I take that to heart. And I think when I teach the class again, I teach the class again that I\u0027m going to do that first and make sure that I\u0027ve got better supports set up for students. If, if the, the sort of secondary trauma or tertiary trauma of reading and absorbing all of this gets Katherine: to be too much. Absolutely, absolutely. Yeah, I can imagine that that would be, that would be. A great idea. To start it out that way. What were some of the people that you brought in, was there someone that like really stood out to you that a story that they told really resonated with you? Marie: Yeah. Well, you know, they, they all stand out for me, but I\u0027ll just tell a couple of stories that I think the students found particularly meaningful. And I should say again, to go back to the personal and the student said, it wasn\u0027t just hard for them. You know, they loved the class. They loved getting to think about this and process this. And I think they all. felt that this would really shape them going forward. Help [00:22:00] them be better friends and, and helpers of other people who\u0027ve gone through trauma. You know, I think for a lot of us who aren\u0027t survivors, we don\u0027t realize how deep the trauma goes until you read and learn. You\u0027ve got to be educated about that. And I think these guests really helped do that. So I had guests two of the guests have been. Leaders in an organization called snap the survivors network of those abused by priests, which was founded primarily as a Catholic organization for Catholic survivors of clergy abuse, and they really went back into first kind of realizing that the abuse that they had experienced, trying to tell going to church authorities and having in their cases door slammed against them over and over again. And that the trauma of that was worse than the original sexual abuse itself. Right. I\u0027m sure you hear this over and over again. Very Katherine: common. Very common. [00:23:00] Marie: And I think for students to hear their story, but also, you know, they helped create SNAP. They\u0027ve been public spokespeople across the country. They have helped so many people, so many victims. And, you know, I think educated so many of us who are not victims. about this, that the students found them really inspiring. That was, that was really great. And David Clossie, who was the longtime leader of the SNAP, I\u0027m just lucky because he lives here in St. Louis. And so he was able to visit our class in person along with Barb Doris who was also a SNAP leader, but he\u0027s a very emotional person still. And he cries a lot and he\u0027ll tell you that. So he\u0027ll tell stories and he is, his emotions are right there. But he has also processed it. He has sort of come out on top of it and he\u0027s just a really inspiring figure. So students really loved hearing from him. Another standout, I\u0027ll just mention just one more. We had a local lawyer and I won\u0027t mention her [00:24:00] name because she\u0027s really had a tough time. She has worked on a lot of different clergy, sexual abuse cases in the states of Illinois and Missouri primarily, and the laws here. are really, really tough. I would say they are stacked against victims in a lot of very concrete ways. And she talked to us about that and really educated us about the law. And it got so bad for her that after 25, 30 years or so of practicing and working in that area, she just was burned out. She realized that she She could even be a suicide risk after all that she had to leave. And so she went and is now in a completely different field of law. And the students were really, I think, moved by her. Some of my students want to go to law school. They want to work in that area, but they also recognized, you know, what she had to say about the toll that this can take on people. Who really try to find justice for survivors, because it\u0027s a lot [00:25:00] harder in some states than others, but it\u0027s hard everywhere. Yeah. Katherine: You know? Yeah. It\u0027s just, yeah. It really, the justice system doesn\u0027t work in favor of of someone coming forward and saying, this happened. Especially if there\u0027s, if there\u0027s not like, Capturing physical evidence of something like that is just not easy. If it if it even is possible. Yeah, that is, that is really really incredible. Did you have anything else to say about the class and then I would love to just talk a little bit about book. Marie: . No, I would just say that I would encourage if anybody is interested in thinking about teaching a class like this for undergrads, for grad students, seminary students, feel free to contact me, rmg567 at gmail. com. And also I\u0027ll just say, I\u0027m still, you know, interviewing survivors and people and would love to hear from folks, but I would just really encourage people to consider doing it. I think. Think it\u0027s a very, I, I\u0027m so glad that I was able to do it, [00:26:00] and I will keep teaching that class until I can\u0027t teach anymore in retirement. Katherine: Oh, I\u0027m so glad. I\u0027m really, really glad that there are dozens and dozens of more students who are going to get that class so I\u0027m really glad to hear that. So switching to talking about this book, Moral Combat that I mentioned. Earlier, the subtitle has sex divided American Christians and fractured American politics. And then I want to hear about a little more about the current book that you\u0027re working on as well. But my main question about this book is why sex? Why is sex such a big deal? What is it about sex that is making it this thing that divides people? Marie: Catherine, that is the question. That is absolutely the question. That\u0027s really the question that sent me on the journey to write this. And I don\u0027t know if even now I have an answer to it. And really, I came to it thinking like, you know, sex is not a big [00:27:00] topic in the New Testament. It\u0027s really not compared to caring for the poor. Caring for the poor, caring for people, helping the world, helping those in need, visiting the prisoner, feeding the hungry. Those are the themes, right? Those are the crucial, crucial themes. They\u0027re not the only themes, but that, to me, is so obviously the core that Jesus taught, that that should be the obsession. And it\u0027s not. It\u0027s, it\u0027s not, it\u0027s not to say churches don\u0027t care about those things, of course they do. Catholic, Protestant, they all care about those things, but the thing that has seemed to be the obsession is around disciplining people for their sexual behavior. And that just struck me and, and it was true in my Southern Baptist upbringing. I mean, that was just like, you know, a very strong theme in life generally. So I think I\u0027ve always wondered. Why is something like [00:28:00] that so important? And you know, it\u0027s partly, I mean, our sexuality goes to the core of who we are, right? In every aspect of our lives. And if we wanna discipline people into being certain kinds of people, that\u0027s sort of a really key area. You know, that, that the rules need to be sort of upheld and abided by. But to me, I honestly feel and I know a lot of folks would disagree with me on this, but I think a lot of Christian leaders have really gone way beyond anything, you know, biblical to create systems and structures and rules. That, that weren\u0027t really of, of great interest or concern to Jesus or to to any of these early teachers. The early church fathers, you know, once Jesus is dead and Paul\u0027s dead and the kind of church is sort of coming into being in the early centuries, those leaders carried up, cared a lot about sex and disciplining the flesh and celibacy of [00:29:00] course, and, and thought the body was evil and thought sexuality was sort of this evil demonic force. That\u0027s kind of where a lot of this influence comes from. If, if you, if you\u0027re more interested in going back to a biblical view of Christianity, I just think a lot has been invented, has been weaponized, has been interpreted a specific way to make sex more important than it, than it really ought to be for, for Christian for Christians generally. Would Katherine: you say if... If it\u0027s about power, let\u0027s just theorize that it\u0027s about power. Is there a possibility that sex is just an easy thing to control? And it\u0027s more just like open and, you know, like, you can hide it but like something like, attracted to the same sex and you want to have that kind of relationship or, or like that physical act of Being with someone and having [00:30:00] intercourse and like, like those are just like physical things and it\u0027s just like an easier thing to control and because it\u0027s more like out there could that be a reason why this is the thing if it\u0027s about power? I don\u0027t know. Marie: No, I think that\u0027s definitely part of it. And of course, sex is tied to reproduction, too, right? So it\u0027s not just about sexual behavior. It\u0027s about, you know, women bearing children and whose children will they be bearing. So, you know, we know that in cultures all across time and place that we\u0027ve been able to study, sex is also very important in societies. It\u0027s not just Christians who have made sex important. So I want to be clear about that. And part of that is because it is still, in many cases, about power. Men want to know that the children their wives are bearing are their children. Like, that\u0027s, that\u0027s one thing that anthropologists have, have a lot of times talked about. Kinship relations and, you know, these kinds of things. So, sex has been important in part because it is... [00:31:00] deeply tied up in in reproduction. And, and I think our reproductive politics today, a lot of the, you know, the, the refusal to see that the way to reduce the abortion rate is to make contraception more available to prevent problem pregnancies and unwanted pregnancies. But you don\u0027t see this huge push on the part of Christians, mostly. To provide free birth control and to make sure that there\u0027s sex education in the public schools of a certain kind, those issues often, you know, are still kind of, you know, forbidden and go with anti abortion politics. So I think the reproduction part is really a key part of this, but, but yes, I think it is also about power and. restricting women\u0027s movements, restricting you know, this huge portion of their lives and, and, and making a certain model of marriage, you know, seem like the norm, seem like the God ordained norm. There\u0027s one norm for marriage and, and that\u0027s [00:32:00] it. And you know, really, I think there\u0027s had to be a lot of. Inventiveness to make that seem like, you know, something that God so deeply cared about right, Katherine: right, right. So would you say that aside from it being a sex thing, that it really is a gendered thing? I know you had mentioned that earlier and like more about dare we say it\u0027s control of women and it\u0027s not just about. celibacy and like purity. It\u0027s really about the purity of women. Oh Marie: yeah. I, I, I think the sources bear that out very, very clearly that the, you know, the, the sort of purity obsession has always been the purity of women. It\u0027s not to say men\u0027s purity hasn\u0027t been talked about and emphasized to a degree, but men have been far less punished for sex outside of marriage and sometimes not punished at all compared to the, the sort of discipline. of women for, for, for that. So [00:33:00] I think it\u0027s very much about gender. The book, Moral Combat, you may remember, you know, I start the book with the suffrage movement, the women\u0027s suffrage movement, because that, to me, in some ways, is, is one of the, the kind of, of the core culture war issue we we almost think now so women got the right to vote in 1920, of course, and we kind of think of that as like, Okay, well, that happened and then everything you know, everybody accepted that. But in fact, there was so much energy against allowing women to vote, you know, it was very close that the, you know, the states had to ratify, you know, this amendment Tennessee my home state was the final one to ratify it. I\u0027m proud to say. My grandmother was a suffragist who, who marched for that, but it wasn\u0027t easy. And the animus against women voting or women having something like equal rights, at least in that one sphere, you know, that animus didn\u0027t go away. And so I think a lot of what [00:34:00] you see in these later movements against birth control. Against homosexuality, against sex education, against reproductive rights. The roots are there in the anti suffrage movement. So it\u0027s very much about women, about a desire for women to stay in their place. And let me say clearly, it\u0027s not just men who have wanted that. I don\u0027t write this as a men against women yeah. just as many women are invested in that kind of patriarchal hierarchical system because they benefit from it in some way economically, socially. And so patriarchy, or I want to say misogyny, these are systems held up, I think equally by men and women in many, many cases. And and that\u0027s a crucial part of the story that we also sometimes I think tend to forget. Katherine: Yeah. And I think it\u0027s a, it\u0027s harder. , I would just say from just like [00:35:00] purely from a personal personal perspective to see women fighting so hard for these things. And when I see women upholding it and defending it just it feels very different and it lands very different than like a man. Upholding it and and defending it as well. But it\u0027s also true. It\u0027s also very, very true. And, and I, and I learned that very quickly working in and very patriarchal spaces that just because there was a woman in the room didn\u0027t make it safer and didn\u0027t necessarily mean that women were actually respected in that space. , and yeah, absolutely. And then I don\u0027t remember the name of the person, but the person that was fighting for Susan\u0027s Someone maybe fighting for contraception and like the main argument was that it was gonna allow women to be loose and, and have sex with anyone they wanted. And, and she was just like, give us a, give us a break. Maybe we just like, just want to have freedom. Maybe that, [00:36:00] maybe that\u0027s what it, maybe it has nothing to do with promiscuity and just like, just like that being the argument, like, and that is. It\u0027s still the argument and that\u0027s why I like the church isn\u0027t, you know, pushing contraception and making contraception available as a, as a potential solution to mitigating abortion is because it\u0027s, it\u0027s that same thing, like present day, that same argument is just going to give them license. Yet we\u0027re not talking about that for men, like men who don\u0027t have to most of the time. deal with a fear of getting pregnant. Like that\u0027s not something that men have to carry. So we\u0027re not worried about them. We\u0027re not worried about it in that, in that context. And so, oh my gosh, there\u0027s so many, so many things. Is there anything else you want to say about that? And then I\u0027d, I\u0027d love to hear about your, your latest that you\u0027re working on now. Marie: Sure. I think you\u0027re right. I mean, just. stress. I think what [00:37:00] you\u0027re saying is we\u0027re still having the same debates that we were having in the 1920s. It\u0027s a maybe a modernized version of it. But I do think our contemporary debates over abortion and and even to some degree, sexual abuse, sexual harassment, you know, I write about Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas and also about Paula Jones and Bill Clinton, the kind of sexual harassment wars of the 1990s, some of which has been a little bit Thank forgotten. Those were really critical to because it was about how are women treated in the workplace and what is okay and what is not okay. And it\u0027s shocking to think what we used to tolerate. You know what? I mean, my mother, who\u0027s now in her eighties, she\u0027ll tell me what she tolerated as a secretary, you know, in the 19 sixties and seventies and in the church. Well, yes, in the church and outside the church, both the kind of soft sexism that we all accepted. Not so soft sometimes. So anyway, I would just say that I do think we learn a lot from history [00:38:00] and that reading up on these earlier debates, I think really sheds important light. On the kinds of arguments that we\u0027re still having now, both within the church and within our larger culture. Yeah, Katherine: and then just like the context of history about just like history just like repeats itself and then repeats itself and repeats itself and, and it\u0027s typically about one group of people or one set of people wanting to be in charge, and in America, it\u0027s about like the religious right. It seems wielding Christianity and this war for morality as the way to have power and be in charge and just even just thinking about like very recent election and political figures who, who didn\u0027t give a shit about, actual Christianity. They just got people. You know, whipped up into a frenzy and made them fearful of, , the trans, the trans [00:39:00] agenda, the figurative trans agenda. And before that it was the gay agenda, and then the feminists, and the feminists are after your children, and and then, and then now, like, making abortion the thing and it\u0027s about, like, saving children, but it\u0027s not about saving children, it\u0027s about this, like, control thing and so that to me is, I mean, just intersects with my work, and is, is pretty scary to me that this, And there was kind of just this out of body experience a little bit just like reading the book and thinking about that and then I\u0027ll have those moments at times of like, this was the sect, and I came from a very fundamentalist world that was, was very militant in fighting abortion and getting, you know, Christian people that they claimed were Christians into politics and fighting, against like sex, sex education in school because it would just give people license to promiscuity. They were very, very militant and it\u0027s just a very out of body experience to think like that was a sect that I used to be a part of. And I believed they were good people, and [00:40:00] some of them are very good people and, and that the outside world was bad, like those, those bad people that are pro abortion or pro, pro same sex marriage, and to think just like how militant it was. Now, like looking back on it and just like how just active it was and genuinely good people within it. Absolutely. 100 percent at the same time, people who are just wielding this for power and, and wanting to like claim all of this power in the name of Jesus. And it\u0027s, it\u0027s scary. It\u0027s, it\u0027s real. Marie: I would just say I, yeah, that is, that\u0027s it\u0027s so true. I, I see it as a true tragedy that Christianity has been so weaponized in this country and elsewhere, not just in the U. S. And all the time and energy and money that has gone into some issues at the [00:41:00] expense to, in my mind. Of the poor and the suffering and other, you know, really critical issues and how blase we are about economic inequality in this country and, and the state of the poor and suffering of many kinds. To me, it\u0027s a tragedy, you know that that we allowed ourselves to get so hung up on particular issues, and have just been almost blinded. To what I see is really the core message, Katherine: In the Bible. How does that. Message tie in with what you\u0027re working on right now. Marie: Yeah. Well, it\u0027s you know So now this is a hard it\u0027s a it\u0027s an even more grueling Project as you can imagine because a lot of my sources now are interviews And I really spent a few years now and i\u0027m really in the thick of it now that i\u0027m on leave Interviewing, you know, survivors mostly, but also family members, pastors, you know, people, as I said earlier, just like [00:42:00] my class, different visitors coming from different places, but the vast majority are survivors, survivors of childhood sexual abuse, of abuse when they were teenagers, and also adults, you know, adults, largely women I\u0027ve interviewed so far, but of course there are men too, you know, who have been abused as men sexually abused. And abuse happens everywhere. You know, abuse happens absolutely everywhere. The church is not, you know, the only place it happens. But cover ups feel different in different spaces, I think. And the, the degree of the cover up in the church, Is so disillusioning for so many people, the spiritual abuse, the spiritual damage that that has caused people in many ways. That\u0027s sort of the big takeaway for me right now is just how profoundly damaging. Sexual abuse is for people when they are not believed, when they are not treated with love and care. [00:43:00] And, when they are prevented from seeking justice, it\u0027s crazy making. I mean, people can just go absolutely crazy. And the degree, you know, the levels of substance abuse and all kinds of. You know, self destructive behaviors that emerge from that is just stunning. And, we\u0027ve learned a lot about this since 2002. And that 2002 is an important year because that was when the Boston Globe broke the big stories, the early stories about abuse in the Catholic Church in the, in the archdiocese of Boston. And, you know, that kind of began this trajectory of attention to the abuse crisis, at least within the Catholic Church, and then more recently in Protestant groups, too. But I think we still have no idea the scope, the scale, the damage that has been done and is still being done because of the cover ups, because of bullying by pastors who refuse to acknowledge this problem [00:44:00] and women who enabled them pastors wives or, or church staff or others who just don\u0027t want to believe this is true. And so really, enable abusive environments to thrive. It\u0027s a hard subject. And, you know, I want to write a book people want to read. So I\u0027ve got to find a way to be, you know, I want to say Here\u0027s what we do, like here\u0027s where hope is because otherwise who wants to read a book that\u0027s such a downer? But I think we all need to be better educated about the realities out there so that we can be equipped to know what to do about them. Katherine: Mm hmm. Is there any Distinction made or is this part of the scope of the book where you\u0027re outlining just the difference between someone who experiences that sexual abuse and cover up within a spiritual context versus. Or, you know, Hollywood, is there a distinction made at all? Marie: Yeah. And, you know, a lot of the guests who came to my class, we asked them this and I asked [00:45:00] survivors this, I think so because so let me separate out Catholics and Protestants here because one, one big difference between, I think what Catholics are taught about priests and what Protestants are taught about ministers is the sort of stature of the priest. So traditionally Catholics were really taught that priests. It\u0027s were of a higher order, almost a human being, they, they had a sacramental status closer to God. They were the closest thing that anyone was going to get to God. And the kind of deference that that created is part of why children felt they couldn\u0027t tell if a priest abused them, because it was, this was God. And I think the damage for them, it was as if God Had done the abuse and that\u0027s very hard to get over and I\u0027ve heard this from some Protestants, too I think evangelicals at least for me don\u0027t have quite the same, you know, the the pastor is still a human being He\u0027s perhaps been called, he\u0027s [00:46:00] got a calling. And so there\u0027s still, you know, a lot of deference given to him. But I thought when I started this project, okay, there\u0027s a difference in how pastors are viewed. But I am coming to realize that in a lot of these evangelical churches, It\u0027s pretty close to the same as the Catholics were taught that pastor. He\u0027s on a higher level And what he says, people believe there\u0027s been a lot of abuse of women working for churches. You probably know if I had a lesson for listeners right now, I would say if any pastor comes to you And asks you to come work for his church A red flag up in your mind because he, if, if the pastor needs a new church staff, they need to open the search. They need to go through HR. They need to have a whole process like companies have, like universities have not, you are being targeted. I think in many, many cases, if someone comes to you and says, Hey, you know, you\u0027re doing a great job in the church. Come work for me. I have heard so many [00:47:00] stories from women now. That\u0027s where it starts. Or, or maybe she was already being grouped, you know, she\u0027s come to the pastor for counseling, she\u0027s having difficulty in her marriage or some kind of difficulty with her children. And just, there\u0027s a certain kind of pastor who will target the vulnerable in that way. Now, let me say clearly the vast majority of pastors are not abusers, I definitely believe that. But. There, there are a lot more than I think most of us are aware of people or maybe that because once they reach that position of power, they become sort of convinced of their own authority in a way and they become abusive. I don\u0027t know the psychology of it. I don\u0027t know how all that works. But I think that\u0027s really critically important for people to, to recognize. Katherine: Absolutely. Yeah, and I would say like maybe the distinction between like the Catholicism, the elevation of a priest is it\u0027s elevated institutionally, whereas, at least what I have seen [00:48:00] when it\u0027s a pastor in that place they\u0027ve sort of put themselves there, and it\u0027s not necessarily. Institutionally across the board, that\u0027s what the institution is pointing people towards, but they have managed to get into that position and created that for themselves. Marie: That\u0027s a very good point. I hadn\u0027t thought of that. And I think that\u0027s a very good point, but the ones who are best at it, they persuade everyone in the congregation that they deserve to be in that place. Right. But you\u0027re right. It\u0027s the kind of, the, the charismatic leader, you know, the Ravi Zacharias or, you know, at the local level, whatever, you know, person that is. But you\u0027re right. They managed to kind of accrue that charisma and that sense of leadership themselves. Katherine: Yeah, and maybe the institution comes after in terms of picking it up and not addressing it and not feeding into it. Chicken or egg. I don\u0027t know which comes first. Well, this has been really great and I\u0027m just, I feel like there\u0027s so much more to talk about, [00:49:00] but I will wrap us up there. Is there anything else that you wanted to share as we Wrap up the interview part. Marie: No, I would only ask if anyone listening is interested in talking to me. I really am. I am trying to interview as many people as I can survivors, but also people who want to work for reform in the church and don\u0027t know how family members. friends of people that they worry are being abused. Counselors, anyone, if you are interested in speaking with me, my email is open. R. M. G. 567 at gmail dot com. And I would welcome correspondence with people. I am willing for anyone who wants to be anonymous, to be anonymous. I\u0027m keeping confidentiality from people. A lot of people have very good reason to be confidential. They have children. Sometimes an abuser is, is someone\u0027s spouse or ex spouse, and they really don\u0027t want their children to know, right? There\u0027s all kinds of reasons. And I\u0027m sensitive to that and we want to protect anyone and not [00:50:00] re traumatize them. But yes, I welcome anyone to contact me who would be Katherine: interested and your timeline for. When they hear this episode versus when your book is coming out. So timing, when is, when are you hoping to finish? Marie: Well, I\u0027m a scholar, not a journalist and scholarship is slow. So this book is going to be, you know, a few years in the making realistically. So it\u0027s not like I\u0027ve got a deadline, you know, of the end of October or something, I I\u0027m on leave all of this year, the 2023, 2024, I could. Here and Katherine: anytime. All right, great. And I will put that information in the show notes so people can easily access and thank you so much for your time and all of the work that you\u0027re doing.

Transcript (Unedited for Typos and Misspellings) Brian: [00:00:00] Hello everyone, welcome to our session. I\u0027m here with Katherine Spearing. Katherine is the founder of Tears of Eden, a non profit supporting survivors of spiritual abuse, and the host of Tears affiliate podcast Uncertain. She also hosts the podcast Trauma and Pop Culture, and is a certified trauma recovery coach, working primarily with clients who have survived cults, High control environments, spiritual abuse, and sexual abuse. She also provides specialized trauma informed career coaching, as folks with trauma often need extra support for interviewing and networking, which I can attest to. Catherine is the author of a historical romantic comedy, which we talked about last year, Hartford\u0027s, a novel that challenges gender roles in a patriarchal society that will appeal to fans of Jane Austen. And she\u0027s been a guest on a number of podcasts. including indoctrination, and that\u0027s so effed up. She\u0027s the author of several non fiction articles and writes regularly at katherinespearing. com and tearsofeden. org. Welcome back, welcome back. [00:01:00] Very excited, Katherine: very excited. Me too. Brian: So we\u0027re here to talk today about being single within the context of faith communities, which is a big I don\u0027t know anywhere else that I really hear about this talked about, so I\u0027m excited to dive into it. What is it like for a single person within these communities? Katherine: Right, yeah, and I think on the subject of it not being talked about very much, I definitely looked, obviously, that\u0027s who I am. So I have looked for books on this particular topic, and they all tend to have this, like, this like, consolation prize flair to it. Like You\u0027re a single, but you didn\u0027t want this. So here\u0027s some tips for being happy despite the situation that you find yourself in as if it\u0027s like. So so sad. And so haven\u0027t haven\u0027t read a lot where I was just like, Oh, like I\u0027m empowered. I\u0027m inspired. I\u0027m [00:02:00] encouraged very, very rarely. And then also just within this topic that I\u0027m very, I\u0027m very passionate about just living a thriving life wherever you are and being very present wherever you are, no matter. Single or not, and I think 1 of the things that I have discovered through just the work that I do with religious trauma and spiritual abuse survivors is that to say, hey, like, it\u0027s, you know, really important to live a thriving life here. Here are tools to live a thriving life to then. Ignore the systemic issues that then make it difficult to have a thriving life. It\u0027s kind of, it\u0027s just half of the story. And so there\u0027s a lot of. Messaging towards singles of just like be content and be happy within faith communities without acknowledging the things that then make it difficult to be happy. And one example is [00:03:00] I learned very, very young that it was okay for me to be single, but it was okay for me to be single only. If I was unhappy about being single and only I was actively seeking to change that status and at the same time be happy being single and so rejoice in this lot that God has given you, but then also actively seek to change it and actively. Date and actively ask for prayer for your future husband. So, it\u0027s very, very stark cognitive dissonance happening within these communities. I also, my, my vocation was ministry and the perspective that I\u0027m coming from for this conversation is. The even growing up in the evangelical church and being in that evangelical perspective, also choosing a vocation of ministry and and being in that for almost a decade. [00:04:00] And and so I think I experienced some of this a little bit more acutely because. I was in ministry and, and happened to be in denominations that were just much more male friendly. And so having being a woman and then also being a single woman some of the stuff I experienced a little bit more acutely. So that\u0027s, that\u0027s the example that I\u0027m, the perspective that I\u0027m coming from and, and then we\u0027ll occasionally use just some stories and examples from clients and, and friends of mine who\u0027ve also experienced this as well. And. But, yeah, so 1st of full time vocational ministry experience was on the mission field in Mexico. I\u0027m 28 years old. I am the only single woman on this fairly large missions team. I went down. To help plant a church that was like my specific reason for going and the, there was a [00:05:00] headquarters office that I went to every day as part of my work and and, and pretty much right away things like they would have a team meeting for. The church plant, and I was not invited and I, I, I was actively a part of the missions team and would like, go to the office and work in the mission field. All the other women missionaries were. worked at home and were, you know, took care of their children and took care of their homes. They were not actively coming into the offices. They were invited to this missions team. And so right off the bat, I was like different here. Exactly. Just instantly. And in Mexico, the. The that\u0027s hierarchy of, of marriage and marital status is even more extreme, I would say, than [00:06:00] than in the, like the South, which is also pretty extreme and. And yet nobody was like, Hmm, it\u0027s weird that you\u0027re not there. It was like, there was no, and I decided not to make an issue about it, that particular thing. But I was still expected to show up, you know, to church an hour early and help set up and put the coffee on. So I was still a part of this team and help lead the Bible studies and all that sort of stuff, but not part of the planning, not offered a seat at the table. And, and it wasn\u0027t a gender thing. It was. The only thing I can think of. A singleness thing. I\u0027m not married. And I think that that was something that I experienced constantly throughout my faith community experience was like, we not a, there\u0027s something wrong with you so much, but as a, but a, we don\u0027t know what to do with you. Like, we don\u0027t know [00:07:00] what category to put you in. Another example was, I was volunteering. Very actively, this is before I went to Mexico in the youth ministry, and I was very, very actively involved in the youth ministry again, like late 20s, considering youth ministry as a potential avenue for ministry. If I did go into full time ministry, and the church that I attended did not have like, singles groups and young marrieds and it was just kind of all adult classes and they were topical, which I think is great and. There was a parenting class, and I thought I\u0027m gonna work. I\u0027m working with youth. 50 percent of that is working with parents and. And then it was targeting like young marriage. Who are my peers? Like some of them are the same age as me. Mm-Hmm. . Some of them are a little bit older, some of them are a little younger. And so it made perfect sense to me that I would go [00:08:00] to this class, which I did, and a week class, I had friends who were leading this class. A married couple that was leading the class, leading the class. And so I knew them and then there was an older couple in the class who had already raised their children and they were there because they wanted to connect to younger families. And they were the only people that talked to me, nobody else talked to me. And it was so. obvious that as soon as there would be like a break or the class would end they would like huddle like so fast it was like like very very quickly just just like ah we don\u0027t don\u0027t leave us alone yeah with that one we don\u0027t Brian: we don\u0027t know what to do with her Katherine: we don\u0027t know what to do with her and so i\u0027ll always feeling that Experience and, and many years later, I worked in [00:09:00] California, which is a very different culture and and I had a very good experience as a single person in California. And I started to wonder after a few years being there, did I make that up? Was that my imagination? Like, like, maybe it wasn\u0027t as bad. Maybe it was my insecurity. Like, maybe, you know, I, I felt weird. And so that\u0027s why I thought these people were ignoring me or whatever. And then I was in in LA during the biggest part of COVID. So didn\u0027t really interact with many people and thought, Oh, maybe I just made it up. Maybe if I go into the spaces and I\u0027m just like super confident, like, they\u0027ll be fine. Maybe it\u0027s not as bad as I thought. And, and yet, even now, when I go into certain communities, and I would say probably the biggest one right now is as extended family that is in the South. And it is a much more just like, Nuclear family focused. [00:10:00] Everything is focused on that and you get married and you have kids and then you raise the kids and they go to college and then they get married and they have kids and then they raise their kids and their kids go to college and then they get married and they have kids and that\u0027s just a cycle and rinse and repeat and I would go, go to, go to events, go to weddings, go to funerals, be around this, this community of people and It, I was like, it\u0027s still here. It\u0027s, it\u0027s still real. And, and after like three hours of talking about feeding schedules and potty training, I\u0027m sitting there like, okay, I have a pretty cool life. A lot of cities. I started this nonprofit. I have a book out. I have a podcast. Like I\u0027m a pretty interesting person. No questions, zero interest in my life outside of how much I can engage with their life. And so it\u0027s very, it was [00:11:00] very, it\u0027s very, very obvious in those. In certain contexts that there\u0027s this otherness and this marginalization and just like you\u0027re different and rather in engaging with that difference, we\u0027re just going to draw a distance and at best you\u0027re ignored at worst, they\u0027re actively trying to get you to change who you are and change your marital status and try to figure out what\u0027s wrong with you that you\u0027re not married. Right, that is how that is. Brian: Yeah. Thank you for sharing all that. And I\u0027m, I\u0027m sorry that happened to you and that\u0027s not at all alienating. Right? My goodness. Well, and I remember working at a church as a young single man. And I was the worship leader at the time, but it was just. It is a lot of that alienating feeling of, well, who can we hook you up with? When are you going to [00:12:00] get married? Let\u0027s pray for your future wife. And all these things, it\u0027s like, and there was a big part of me that wanted to get married, but there was also a big part of me. It\u0027s like, but this is kind of, I\u0027m fine with this right now. This is the season of life I\u0027m in. And why is there always this need to rush? People through these stages of life that may not be for them at all, because even once you\u0027re married, then it\u0027s the whole train of, oh, well, when are you going to have kids? And then once you have another one, and then it\u0027s like, some people are just never satisfied, right? There\u0027s this, there\u0027s this weird hierarchy of. Having arrived as a human and it\u0027s, I can\u0027t even imagine cause I\u0027m not one, but I, it\u0027s so much worse for women because not only do you have to get married, but then once you are someday a wife, if you don\u0027t become a mother, then you\u0027re not really a whole woman and all these other things that I\u0027ve heard that are just so harmful in these faith communities. Katherine: Absolutely. Yeah. And then, and then the difference, there is a different flavor, but I think between like a male [00:13:00] experience and a female experience. And I remember going to seminary and, and the church planting, there\u0027s like a church planting portion of the seminary that I went to and I loved church planting and I thought it was really cool. Well, I was told. You know, you\u0027d be a really good church planter if you were a man. The men were told, don\u0027t church plant unless you\u0027re married. Like, don\u0027t do that. Like, that\u0027s, I would not advise doing that. Like, you can\u0027t do it unless you\u0027re bound to another person or you have a wife to do 50 percent of your free labor. So the pressure, like you\u0027re not fully Incubated yet. Brian: Yeah, unlike, you know, Paul or Jesus or so, you know, for all this stuff that\u0027s going on in the churches in different faith communities. Why does this stuff happening Katherine: matter? I think the biggest reason why it matters is [00:14:00] it can result in very real trauma to, to constantly feel like you don\u0027t fit. Yep. And constantly feel like You are not enough all by yourself. Mm-Hmm. . And that, that that can result in, you know, when you\u0027re, you know, supposed to, trying to embrace your life and, and be confident. And be secure and, and love who you are, where you are. And then you\u0027re surrounded by people who are looking at you like you\u0027re really strange or just like. Saying things like, well, do you even want to get married or accusing you of being too picky or, or constantly receiving this message of you\u0027re not fully. You haven\u0027t fully arrived yet. You\u0027re not a full, complete human. And, and then as you mentioned, I think that this can have just like [00:15:00] implications for just like the wider community as well, of, of people getting married when they\u0027re not ready to get married and I, it happens. I am so grateful and honored. That enough people have shared with me that they got married too soon. And enough people have shared with me that the reason they got married was because they were dating someone who wanted to marry them and they were afraid someone else wasn\u0027t going to come along. And so they locked it down and, and enough people who have admitted that, which means there\u0027s probably a lot of more people who have never. Admitted that because of how much pressure there is like a man saying, hey, you can\u0027t plan a church unless you\u0027re married. Okay. Let me just find someone to marry me. Oh, maybe in an ideal world. That would never happen. Well, it does happen. And, and there is so much [00:16:00] pressure to, and people end up in these relationships that are Not necessarily healthy because they haven\u0027t had a chance to differentiate. And the messaging around marriage and the nuclear family can lead to a lot of enmeshment in marriage and, and people who aren\u0027t able to, to create individual identities because they\u0027re so wrapped up in, in that, in that partnership for women. It results in a lot of them just surrendering their power and surrendering their agency the minute that they\u0027re in that relationship. And, and I have friends now who are in their forties and fifties who are learning about their, themselves and their identity as an individual for the very first time, because they just got married so young, they never had an opportunity to figure out who they were and what they really [00:17:00] liked and. I have friends who have told me, and this makes me very sad, that their predominant emotion once they got married Wasn\u0027t joy and wasn\u0027t excitement. It was relief. That makes me so sad that it\u0027s like, it\u0027s over like, so, so sad. And speak so loudly of the amount of pressure and the, and the. Miseries to some extent of being single in these faith communities that isn\u0027t self inflicted. A lot of times parts of it. Sure. But, but a lot of it is, is the community itself of not not having. And I have a dozen stories similar to the Mexico story of just like not having a seat at the table simply because well, part of its gender and part of it was marital status and and not being Treated as if I didn\u0027t have anything to [00:18:00] offer because, because I wasn\u0027t married. And if you are in those communities all the time, you have no other reference. You\u0027ll start to believe it. It\u0027s really hard to not believe when you\u0027re getting that inundated with that messaging, that there\u0027s something wrong with me and I don\u0027t have anything to offer. Why? Why would I want to be at the church planting meeting? I\u0027m not married. I don\u0027t have anything to offer that that type of experience. And it\u0027s very, it doesn\u0027t just impact single people. I believe very firmly that this. This mentality impacts the wider faith community as well. And as you mentioned, just like, you know, you get married and then it\u0027s like when you\u0027re going to have kids and the same thing for child free people. Like, you\u0027re allowed to be child free, but only if you\u0027re actively seeking to change it. Right? Yet also be content with your child freeness, but also be trying to change it. And then my sister, first baby. Baby wasn\u0027t [00:19:00] even barely out of the womb and people are asking her when her second child is coming. Yeah, when\u0027s the next one? When\u0027s the next one? It\u0027s like never enough, it\u0027s never enough, never enough, never Brian: enough. Yeah, man. It just speaks to how broken these systems are and how flawed the theology is of identity, of wholeness, like you\u0027re talking about, of, of, like you\u0027re saying, the whole individuation and differentiation piece. It\u0027s like, I, you know, you tell your, that story about all the things about Mexico and all these other places. And it\u0027s like, and you know, joining these different small groups or Sunday school classes I think of that quote from Walt Whitman or Ted Lasso or whoever you want to say it\u0027s from about being curious, not judgmental, right? And so often people in these faith communities default to a position of judgment or assumption, [00:20:00] right? Oh, this poor single person, they must be miserable. Let\u0027s adopt them and then try to find every eligible. Whatever, to pair them up with. Parade them, parade them across. Yeah. Well, and then by doing that, you turn them into a thing instead of a person, right? Because they become, you become their project, which never feels good. Never. And then you, you add on the layer of what harm purity culture has done to the church through the 80s and 90s. And all these people, like you\u0027re saying, get married young out of a sense of relief to escape the trap of singleness. And then, or they just get married so they finally have sex. Which is awful because they\u0027ve known nothing about it and weren\u0027t ready for it, right? And then, you know, in the 80s and 90s, there was so much vitriol and defense against divorce. And nowadays, Christians are the exact same statistic as everyone else. It\u0027s so, so Katherine: common. Yeah, and I mean, and that is one of the [00:21:00] ways that it impacts the wider community as well, is because there are so many divorced people, widowed people, they\u0027re single. And, and they\u0027re back in that, you know, phase after being married. And it\u0027s again, like, what do we do with you? Yeah. Like. Let\u0027s find you someone else to marry, like, let\u0027s say the cycle starts again and, and it\u0027s not, it\u0027s not that, it\u0027s not a guarantee that marriage A will happen or B will last and, and, and that, and that ability, as you said, to have that curiosity. A kind curiosity. Not a what\u0027s wrong with you, but a tell me about your life. Tell me how you feel about this. And, and giving, giving that space [00:22:00] for people to be different and willingness and that judgment tends to come from a place of fear. We, we fear the thing we don\u0027t understand. If someone gets married at 22. And has never known a life of singleness, they\u0027re not going to know what it\u0027s like and so it\u0027s going to be very different. It\u0027s going to be an anomaly and it\u0027s so much, it\u0027s easier to just not engage and like, and it\u0027s safer. To not engage to some extent of just, you know, I\u0027ll let her talk to her people and I\u0027ll talk to my people and, and it\u0027s very sad to me because it\u0027s a very, it can be very isolating, I think, and, and very. What\u0027s the word? Yeah, just like, just very kind of, kind of stagnant and, and [00:23:00] oppressive to, to surround ourselves with people who are just like us and in the same stage as us and can talk about all of the things that we talk about. And, and there it\u0027s, I think that it\u0027s challenging to grow when, when you are. Surrounded by people who are just like you doing all of the things that you do and and how much more vibrant and colorful life is when we can engage with people who are different than us and single people are forced to do that. Because we\u0027re often alone or marginalized in these communities. And so we\u0027re constantly seeing things from the perspective of the married person, the people with the family, we\u0027re able to engage in those conversations about feedings and, and potty training because everyone\u0027s doing it [00:24:00] and, and it does take a little more effort from that parent who has, you From that world and, and look around and see there are other people out there and there are other, there are other stories in the world. And I, I mean, I was raised in a very fundamentalist world that was very isolating and very much like feared the outside world and feared people who were different than us and didn\u0027t believe the same things that we believed. So it was not because of nurture. Unless it was rebellion, potentially that I love. Encountering people who are different than me. Like I love encountering different cultures. I love encountering people who have, you know, jobs that I\u0027ve never had different, different lifestyles, different cities, country. Like I just, I love engaging with people who are different and I [00:25:00] find it to be such a fulfilling experience to have so many people that are so different from me. in my life. It\u0027s amazing. And I\u0027m sad for extended family and in the South who cannot engage with conversation outside of their bubble. That makes me sad, you know, personally, but then also just like, you don\u0027t get to know me. Yeah. Brian: Well, and you know, microcosms of. These echo chambers where this tiny little community\u0027s behaviors become normalized and then you view everyone else like you\u0027re saying as the outsider as the other and like, well, that\u0027s weird when really it\u0027s like, actually, it\u0027s your little group that you can\u0027t see outside of right? So, so how do we break out of that? Like, what can, what can be done? Katherine: Right? Well, I would say just. Speaking to two different audiences and I would say for, I mean, I mean, really for anyone, but for [00:26:00] a single person, I would say, and I\u0027ve had to do this, actively surround yourself with people who are for you and not for you, but They would prefer that something about you change specifically your marital status. And, and, and they\u0027re not constantly trying to set you up or find someone for you. There\u0027s nothing wrong with that. And I, I mean, and setups happen within the single community too. Like I. A friend of mine the other day, like, showed me two people in a dating app who are in my community. And and I just, you know, gave her my opinion. Like, this person, they are great, but I really don\u0027t think that you would enjoy them. But this person, the little that I know about them, I think that it could be a good fit. And we\u0027re not, like, hoarding all the single people. Like, I\u0027m like, I know these two people aren\u0027t a good fit for me. They might be a good fit. I\u0027ve, you know, connect friends in other [00:27:00] cities. Like, Hey, so and so lives in your city. Y\u0027all should get coffee. Brian: Well, and I imagine the big difference is that it\u0027s invited, right? Instead of imposed. Katherine: Yes. She showed me the people on her dating app. I\u0027m like. Asked my opinion. 100%, 100 percent that the invitation has been given. And it also within the context of actually knowing the person, not just, Hey, this person is single. Yes. That\u0027s good. Together. Yeah. You actually know what would be good for them. And, and so surrounding yourself with people who Campioning you excited for you excited for your life, and I, I have actively had to do that and have had to seek out people and fill my life with people who are on my team and cheering me on and there are some people in my life who still find it a little strange, you know, [00:28:00] my. Marital status, but they\u0027re, they, they have kind of moved to being more of a, an acquaintance simply because of, of, of that particular part of it is that it\u0027s not, I\u0027m not fully accepted in their eyes and they\u0027re not fully able to engage with my life right now. And so that might happen. And it\u0027s challenging, but it\u0027s also absolutely 100 percent worth it to be surrounded by people who are for you. And then for just like the wider community, I think just cultivating, as you have already stated, curiosity and a interest and people who are different, and that will serve. across the board for any marginalized community of just being willing to engage and ask questions and not treat like a [00:29:00] project as you, as you mentioned, as someone that I need to fix or my token single friend. Yay! I have one. Well, the Brian: other thought I just had is like, or what I often see in churches or faith communities is that the single people get treated as free labor. Because they\u0027re single. So you must have all the free time in the world to go volunteer for this thing or take care of this thing. And it\u0027s like, can we also stop doing that, please? Katherine: Absolutely. Yeah, I didn\u0027t, I didn\u0027t mention this at the top of the conversation, but in that same church planting experience in Mexico, usually when you start a church, first thing you need is a pastor. And then the next thing you need is a worship leader. And then the next thing you need is a children\u0027s minister. And I saw it coming. I saw it coming. I was like, no, I was like, I drew, I was like, I don\u0027t care if I get fired. No . Yeah. I will not be in charge. Yep. Of Brian: children\u0027s mission. Well, and I\u0027ve heard horror stories from missionaries on the field who, [00:30:00] for their team meetings or staff meetings, same kind of a thing for the single people who were there as part of the team. Fully part of the team. Mm-Hmm. don\u0027t get invited to meetings because they are expected to stay behind and babysit for all the married couples kids, it\u0027s like. What, you know, what is that Katherine: I did during the team meeting? What is Brian: that? Exactly. Yeah. And it\u0027s just, you know, and you know, you\u0027re a trauma recovery coach night. I don\u0027t think either of us are actually therapists or counselors, but, you know, when I think of not just trauma, but complex trauma, like the CPTSD part, it\u0027s, it\u0027s when these little traumas are drip by drip happening over and over and over again, over an extended period of time. And so it makes sense why. We get indoctrinated with these ideas or why it\u0027s so hard to break out of those kinds of systems or Find and surround ourselves with these people who are curious about us and for us and all those things who? Want a real identity? for our single friends [00:31:00] Or single people that we don\u0027t know that we want to become friends with. And it\u0027s like, I just want to know who you are. I don\u0027t care that you\u0027re single or not single or a wife or not a mother yet, or any of these things, like it applies to pretty much every stage of life. If we would allow people to just be people and not projects. We would go a long way. I Katherine: think. Absolutely. Yeah. Just let what? Yeah. And that just simple curiosity of just letting someone be who they are. And, and maybe they will share that they really do want to get married and, and they are sad and hold space for them in their sadness as you would hold space for anyone grieving. Yeah. And, and not necessarily, Yeah. Okay, let\u0027s fix this. Let\u0027s find someone for you. Like that\u0027s grief like any other kind of grief. Yeah. And, and let\u0027s let, let\u0027s grieve together rather than. Yeah. Seek to find [00:32:00] the thing that will take this pain away because it\u0027s, it\u0027s not going to take the pain away really. It\u0027s, there\u0027s going to be something else, you know, like we\u0027re never. We\u0027re never, and I think I learned that recently from the the speaker at the retreat con for Tours de Vida in our first in person event. And she just, she talked about thriving and she gave us this, this grid of all these different like seasons of life and stages of life and your career and then your family and then your relationships and then your friends and then your church community and like all these different, you know, bubbles of our. You know, acquaintances and, and spheres of our lives. And, and she was like, you\u0027re never going to be thriving in every single one. Yeah, and that doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027re not thriving. Yeah. Just to have a few that are not going well does not mean you\u0027re not thriving. And it was really, really helpful because I felt like I was always searching for the state of equilibrium and which [00:33:00] everything was going well. All the time. We\u0027re never going to be in that place, whether we are married or single or otherwise. And so, so being willing to hold that space for someone wherever they are in that and not try to fix it just as we would for anything else. And not treat it like it\u0027s this other thing, like we don\u0027t, this disease to some extent. So let\u0027s stay Brian: away and yeah, well, and you briefly touched on it earlier, but the idea of singleness is not just about I\u0027ve never been married before or been on a date or any of those things, but it\u0027s it\u0027s also people who have been divorced or widowed or whatever those things are. And it\u0027s like when we allow them to just be people. And grieve with them in that process, if they are grieving, right? And then not jump to try to solve their problem of, Oh no, you\u0027re single and alone again. How do we set you up with someone else? It\u0027s like, no, that\u0027s not the answer. It\u0027s like, be curious, ask, like, Has anyone asked what they actually want? [00:34:00] Or are looking for? Or are they perfectly happy being single? Or is it a married couple completely happy never having kids? Yes, whatever the situation is, right? And I think there\u0027s so much that can be said for Meeting people where they are and on allowing them to be where they are in the season that Katherine: they\u0027re in. Yeah. And then I think just to kind of wrap it up of in order to be willing to accept someone where we are, we, I think we have to acknowledge some of that theology that has been ingrained into us that dictates this mentality that marriage singleness and parenthood is more ideal than. Being trialed free and, and the people who have been told that they\u0027re selfish for not wanting children or you\u0027re not a full complete human being until you\u0027re married and joined to another person those, those messages are very damaging and, and that is where that trauma comes from. So some of it\u0027s [00:35:00] just. It\u0027s cultural. I\u0027m like just swimming in it and that\u0027s just the way it is. But some of it actually comes from really damaging messaging about deep things. And that might be something that people need to wrestle with before they can even get to that place. Of accepting someone who\u0027s different because if it\u0027s like, you\u0027re not just different. There\u0027s actually something wrong with you and you\u0027re actually doing something wrong by not having kids or you\u0027re actually doing something wrong by getting divorced or, or, or something like that, then it\u0027s going to be hard to engage. So that might be something that folks just need to. Wrestle with and yeah, figure out what they Brian: believe. Yeah, that\u0027s really good as we wrap up you mentioned your retreat con. Would you tell us more about Katherine: it? Woohoo. Yes. So tears of eden is As mentioned earlier is the non profit for survivors of spiritual abuse and from folks from the evangelical Community primarily. We had our [00:36:00] first in person event in October. And one of the things that Tears of Eden does is we do provide resources to sort of name that experience. But we do seek to be trauma informed. And one of the things that is helpful for healing trauma is, is integration between our minds and our bodies and engaging our bodies in that healing process. And so we had a speaker and she was. A phenomenal, wonderful person. And then and then we also had just very embodied workshops when normally you would go to, you know, maybe a small group and like, sit and listen again in a workshop all of these workshops are very active embodied workshops. We had yoga. We had improv. We had dance. We had a story jam, which is this live storytelling event and that Opportunity for people to tell stories and have an audience engage with them. Just a very embodied event and it was so cool. It was so fun. It was I hope everyone who is a survivor gets [00:37:00] that experience of being in person. With someone who\u0027s also had that experience. There\u0027s something extremely special about just like meeting someone and knowing instantly that they get it. It\u0027s just, there\u0027s nothing like it. It\u0027s, it\u0027s really, really cool. So yeah, everyone gets to do it Brian: sometimes. I love it. Congratulations on getting to do that. Yes, it was great. It was very exciting. Where can people find you or RetreatCon Katherine: online?

      "description": "Connie Baker, LPC author of Traumatized by Religious Abuse and a therapist who works with survivors of religious trauma, joins Uncertain to discuss what thriving might look like after Spiritual Abuse. This is a nuanced subject, intended to provide hope (not pressure!). Thank you for joining us for Spiritual Abuse Awareness Month in 2024!                                     [00:00:00] I\u0027m Katherine Spearing, and this is Uncertain. It\u0027s Spiritual Abuse Awareness Month, and this is our last episode of January 2024. My guest today is someone who It has become very, very special to me. Her name is Connie Baker. She is a therapist. She has a book for survivors of religious abuse. And Connie was our very first guest speaker at our very first in person event.Back in October, and it was phenomenal. She can speak to the survivor experience in such a meaningful way because she is one. And she\u0027s been doing this work long before I even heard of spiritual abuse.She has so much knowledge and I trust her to address this subject of thriving after spiritual abuse with nuance and care because nobody wants to be pressured [00:01:00] into thriving when you\u0027re just trying to survive and that\u0027s not the point of this episode but this is a glimmer of hope for down the road that maybe someday maybe someday We will be here.\u00A0Here is my conversation with Connie Baker.Katherine: Hello, Connie. How are you? Connie: Good. So fun to see you, Catherine. I\u0027m so Katherine: excited to see you again. For our listeners, Connie was our guest speaker, keynote speaker at the RetreatCon, which was Terzian\u0027s very first in person event in the fall. She was phenomenal. I loved every moment of her. Connie\u0027s talks, but then also just getting to hang out with this person.So if you have a chance to buy her book and oh shoot, I\u0027m totally blanking on the name of your book. What Connie: is it? It\u0027s right, Traumatized by Religious Abuse. Yes. Say it one more time. Traumatized by Religious Abuse. Katherine: Beautiful.Wonderful. Amazing book. Very, very, very practical. A lot of folks [00:02:00] have named your book is just very practical for survivors. And one of the things that we invited Connie to do at the retreat con was speak about. Yeah. thriving after spiritual abuse, which I think so many of us are surviving. Maybe we\u0027re healing.We don\u0027t really talk about like that moment when you get a chance to just kind of come out of that survival space and laugh. And have fun and see the sun and, and it seems impossible sometimes that we\u0027ll ever get to that place. Yes. But, but Connie, Connie is really great about making that realistic. Not, that\u0027s, that\u0027s what I think I loved about it.It\u0027s not fluffy and silver linings. It\u0027s realistic and I learned so much from your talk. So I\u0027m really excited to get to jump into that again. to just get us started and sort of lay a [00:03:00] foundation for discussing what it\u0027s like to thrive after spiritual abuse after we\u0027ve been through this. Could you paint a picture for us of what the impact of spiritual abuse feels like?Like, what does that look like to someone? Oh, Connie: yes, yes, I can. Yes, I can. And before we go there, Catherine, I just want to say, I am so thrilled that that was the first retreat. Like, in other words, others are following. It was so, and I know you probably talked about this in follow up podcasts after the retreat, but it was powerful having all those humans.And I think there was also extra power in it post, well, post late pandemic, whatever we\u0027re calling this thing for people to to. Humanly be in the same space and connect. I think, well, Terry, just remembering it, it just was so [00:04:00] powerful. And so I\u0027m just thrilled that you are hosting. Cause we talked about this when I was there.We both have hosted big events before, you know, in our life. And I know what it takes to put something like that on. What was there 25, 30 people somewhere in that range, you know, and, and to have that. And the spaces that you. Provided anyway, I just want everybody to go to second annual. Yes, everybody to thank you so much.Yeah, no, I just I\u0027m just reflecting thinking back just with you even, you know, yes, just being here with you. Remembering just the. Goodness. And all the things that happened there. Katherine: Yeah, I, I\u0027ve, I felt all of those things too. And just was just so thrilled at, I mean, I just like picture that weekend and it\u0027s like surrounded and like sunlight and warmth in my mind.Like that\u0027s the image. It was just such a warm. Just, oh, [00:05:00] and then that whole idea of thriving after spiritual abuse, like we got to taste it, this can be real. This isn\u0027t fake. This isn\u0027t this isn\u0027t false positivity. This is genuine, you know, just joy, like an experience of joy.And the fact that like, oh, after all, all of us have been through, you know, And in this room and we\u0027re laughing together. Like it was just like, Oh, we Connie: laughed so much. Oh my gosh. And you brought a lot of that. You and your leadership team are just pretty damn funny. And we had a lot of fun with that. And so, yeah, I just wanted to say that when you\u0027re talking about that connection, because it really, it really was, I\u0027m just like, no, y\u0027all sign up for number two, second annual Be there.Katherine: So be there for the second one. Absolutely. Connie: Exactly. Exactly. So anyway, the question he asked me, what is it? What is the impact of spiritual [00:06:00] abuse? Oh my goodness. I think, I think a lot. In fact, we talked about this at the retreat. I think a lot in life domains. I think it helps break down sometimes. Like what is What is happening to me?Because it just feels like an avalanche. It feels like you are rolling down the mountain in an avalanche and you can\u0027t see what\u0027s up down, you know. So I guess I think about, you know, different domains of life spiritually. Oh, let\u0027s, let\u0027s take Let\u0027s take the explosion 1 right off the bat. It can not not have an impact spiritually.And that doesn\u0027t mean that you\u0027re for sure going to walk away from the faith, although that absolutely could and sometimes should be what a person does. That\u0027s it. It\u0027s not just permission. It\u0027s like, no. You find your path. But there\u0027s a big [00:07:00] range of what that means, means, but there is no way there is not huge levels of damage, spiritually.It\u0027s like existentially, let\u0027s take God out of the mix, even, if you\u0027re, it doesn\u0027t matter whether you say, Whoa, I\u0027m not about this God thing anymore. You still have to rewrite meaning purpose. Life after death, the, the, the, what is a human being? I mean, you just gotta rewrite all that. It\u0027s just huge.So there again, spiritually, it, it can be devastating. And often is. Often, for me I think. What am I in decade? I\u0027ve done, I\u0027m over three decades past my primary spiritual abuse and there\u0027s still times I go, okay, still rewriting a little bit of this. Katherine: It went, it went deep. Connie: Yes, it goes deep. So then I\u0027m thinking the impact on the body.Most people don\u0027t get out of it without sickness, or, or [00:08:00] injury, or, we\u0027re connected beings, so physically it can just smack ya. In so many ways, I\u0027m not gonna elaborate, but just to help people think through what is the impact, you know? Then you\u0027ve got the emotional, psychological, which most people go through.first. And it\u0027s like, right, that\u0027s true. Katherine: Yes. Yeah. I\u0027m probably the one that makes most sense. Yes. But as you said, we\u0027re integrated and Connie: it\u0027s going to affect our bodies and our spirits and our whatever we want to call it. So, so the trauma, I mean, you and I are therapists and those listeners who\u0027ve heard, you know, you, you know, your stuff and Trauma affects our neurological system, our, you know, our brain, our body, our thought process, our emotions.And so it\u0027s just, it just is so extensive and pervasive. I think is another good word. Then you get into the social realm. Yeah. What does it do to families? [00:09:00] Oh, . What does it do to friendships, to community, to parent child relationships, to marriages, to partnerships? I mean the social impact and community. Oh, how I was just telling client this, I think two days ago.It was yesterday. We were talking about, she\u0027s like, I just, I\u0027m trying to sort out how to get community. And I could tell by how she was talking about it, there was kind of this framework, like, I\u0027m the only one. Why, why, why is this so hard for me? I\u0027m sure other people have it together. There was kind of this underlying implication.And I said, you just need to know something. Do you know, I have this conversation almost daily. Wow. With my clients. What? How? You\u0027re not the only one. No! Please! Rebuilding, especially if you\u0027ve been raised in the church, [00:10:00] Rick, the, okay, we all know on this podcast. What the toxic streams that run through organized religion.We\u0027re clear on that. But I\u0027m telling you, for better and for worse, they do community like nobody else. Katherine: Yeah, and that\u0027s just the reality of like how to find that type of organic community. Oh! Side of the church that that I think that\u0027s probably the biggest grief for me. And then for so many people How do I get that that\u0027s the part I miss the most Connie: besides trauma recovery I would say community especially if we\u0027re talking about thriving when people are finally Starting to put their head up above A little bit and look around to see the devastation.That\u0027s one of the first questions and it\u0027s one of the hardest. So if Those listeners If you guys are struggling to say, how do I do? Community you are not alone. It is [00:11:00] like one of the core themes after trauma recovery I would say it\u0027s number two of saying how do I get the social support and the community?Resources that I used to have in a church because it is what Organized religion does for the positive. It, it provides consistent meeting places, a common worldview, and a common purpose you\u0027re working toward. And I feel like those three things are just in reflection over three decades of trying to sort all this through.Those are the three things I\u0027ve come down to. A lot of organizations have one or two of those, but the power is all three. And it, This consistent meeting time, again, the consistent meeting time, the common world, commonly held worldview, and doing something, making something together, you know, creating something together.Oh my gosh, like, it\u0027s a powerhouse, I think in a very positive way. [00:12:00] We all know it can go very toxic and all that, but there\u0027s also we, we continue our, I think our souls continue to look for that when we say, I can\u0027t do that thing anymore or in that way. Even if you stay in an organized religion in a church, almost everybody I know says, Oh, my relationship with church is completely different.Like it used to be everything. Okay. So we\u0027re getting all. Yeah. The community topic, the damage is so huge and then it can damage things like your finances. All can wipe out your finances to go through religious abuse or to be religious abuse or either one and then you\u0027ve got career. It can even shift career paths for people.And so my hand, yes, right. Exactly. My career. Yeah. Oh, totally. I would never have gone into this field without without my abuse. Not never, but highly unlikely. Honestly. So, so all these different domains of [00:13:00] life, it can. It can determine where you live, you could make up and have to have a move. So I just want to just to be able to bring all that in and say, you know, the impact is monumental.Right. Katherine: And when you said at the beginning, just like addressing that spiritual part, I think that for even folks who have experienced it we\u0027ll kind of do this like compartmentalizing thing of like, it\u0027s just, I just need to figure out that part and like what I believe now. And, and then maybe, or even compartmentalizing it and like, okay, I am done with God and I\u0027m done with church and I\u0027m moving on.But then not recognize all the other places that that is impacting and try to address that one compartment of spirituality. And so I\u0027m very thankful to you for pointing out all of the ways that this can impact us and that we can\u0027t just compartmentalize and just say the right [00:14:00] spiritual thing.Connie: Yeah, we can\u0027t and we can\u0027t compartmentalize any of them. Even even when you talk about mental. You know, you and I are therapists. When we talk about the mental emotional realm, you can\u0027t compartmentalize that because we\u0027re hooked to physical bodies and we\u0027re hooked to worldviews and existential ideas and money and it\u0027s like, no, you know, whatever it is, that part alone, if that, if our brains and neurological system take that hard to hit, it\u0027s going to have, it\u0027s going to have bleed over into other domains.And so, yes, but I totally agree often. Yeah. Because that\u0027s how our brains are trained to think all spiritual, to be very compartmentalized and say the spiritual is the most important. And I think that\u0027s, I think that\u0027s fine to think that, but it\u0027s not the only. You know, and, and to say, Oh, I\u0027m just going to figure out we can cuss on here, right?Yes. In the spiritual, I\u0027m thinking, I\u0027m just going to say it in the [00:15:00] spiritual realm, get it gathered there. We\u0027ll just make everything. Okay. It\u0027s like, Oh. You\u0027ve taken a lot harder hit than just a spiritual issue and that\u0027s huge. I\u0027m not minimizing it. I\u0027m just saying it\u0027s, it does not stand alone, which is what exactly what you\u0027re saying.Katherine: Yeah. And then I also appreciate you highlighting the financial part too, because I think that that\u0027s a. a place that is sort of a hidden impact of it. And, you know, maybe your career and you like switch jobs or you get a new job or you switch careers or you move or Connie: you or might have to make a physical move.Katherine: Yeah. Yeah. Or you, you didn\u0027t, or your job wasn\u0027t impacted and you weren\u0027t like on staff at a church or something and you were still able to do your job. But then. The physical impact that leads to potentially having to go on meds or, or getting ill, as you mentioned, or having to go to therapy and pay [00:16:00] for therapy.Like, I mean, I just think of like how much money I\u0027ve spent on therapy in a decade. I\u0027m like, I could have bought a house with that money. Connie: So Katherine: much money that I am very. Believe was very well spent. I don\u0027t regret spending it. But at the same time, it\u0027s like that. That is a massive one of the reasons. Yeah.And one of the reasons by tears of Eden, we offer our support groups for free because there are so many other things that people have to spend money on to recover. We don\u0027t want to give you another thing that you have to spend money on in order to recover. So yeah, I really appreciate you highlighting, highlighting all of those things for us.What are some of the initial steps that you have seen people take in that healing journey? Common, common things that people will do. Once they have come out of this really horrendous experience. What are some of the steps? Connie: Oh, that\u0027s a [00:17:00] great question. Well, you know, I\u0027m a therapist. And so 1 of them is they\u0027re coming to therapy is 1 of them.And, you know, and let me say something. I truly don\u0027t believe that therapy is the only way to heal. I truly don\u0027t. I think there are people. And there are resources and there are online resources. There are so many things that can help us heal. And a lot of times people go, Oh Connie, you know that person.Oh my gosh, they so need to go to therapy. And, you know, and, and I\u0027ll be like, I need therapy. Yes, exactly. Well, I, I see why you\u0027re saying that. Yes, indeed. But, but really, There\u0027s also, therapy is one piece of a pie in healing, so, and sometimes it\u0027s a really essential pie, and part of the piece of the pie, and sometimes it\u0027s not that [00:18:00] essential a piece, sometimes people do a really good job of doing their own work using other resources, so what I see is people, you know, what they start doing, part of it is they start actually processing their own story in some way or another, so They\u0027re like, okay, what, what just happened to me?Like, I know I was just in an explosion or an avalanche, whatever we want to call it. But, like. What happened? How did it happen? How did it happen to me? What happened? A lot of times it\u0027s not even clear what exactly took place. All I know, I\u0027m bleeding out an artery and I don\u0027t know exactly what happened.Was, was I in a car wreck? Or was it a tornado? Or was it an avalanche? Or how did I get here? So I think processing this story is, [00:19:00] is another thing that people really start doing when they Just like survive the first initial Blow and saying either I\u0027m distancing myself or I\u0027m getting out or whatever form that takes.I think those are a couple really big things right off the top. They start and to heal and thrive. They start having to make connections with other people who get it. Somehow, there may not even fully be other survivors, although I think that\u0027s super helpful and healing, but at the beginning, it just may be somebody who has a good sense and and will Katherine: validate.That was a big deal. Yes, Connie: that was really painful. Yes, exactly. And that was traumatizing and. Wow, how did you survive that the validation feels like such and and they and I think most people in some way or another start getting educated about it [00:20:00] and that\u0027s the answering what happened and I know my book I always say I wrote to me at 25 years old I wrote saying what girl what did you need to understand that you had no clue about that would have Facilitated your healing instead of taking a decade to think I was going to survive the resources we have now.It\u0027s like, you can\u0027t speed up the process, but you can help it and aid it and keep from getting from. Infected you know, re traumatized. There\u0027s certain things you can do to help healing progress. Well, and I didn\u0027t have a lot of that. So that definition of what happened, how was I vulnerable? I\u0027m a strong, yeah, I\u0027m a strong cognitive person.How did, how did this happen to me? I\u0027m a leader. How did this happen? So, you know, all of those things, I think sorting out [00:21:00] the story, getting validation from other people who go, whose eyes get wide and they\u0027re like, What did you go through? And especially when you\u0027ve got a whole community that\u0027s basically saying, it\u0027s your fault.You know, the whole, if you leave a community, the whole community is like, Hmm, your problem, it\u0027s your fault if it\u0027s an abusive system. And Katherine: that\u0027s a lot of people saying that about you. Connie: Oh, you\u0027re, sometimes your whole world. I mean, everybody that matters. As saying that you\u0027re Paul and I remember telling the story to other people, including my second date with my husband, who is now my husband.There was some good trauma dumping that happened there anyway. And honestly, it was also some important information both of us needed to know. And. And so I remember telling him and him being a pastor, a former pastor, he looked right at me and said, that was abuse. Nice. Oh, there were probably some abusive [00:22:00] elements, but I was, you know, it was my issue.I made some bad choices. Oh my gosh, thank God for my husband, you know, who was like calling bullshit. Yeah, this was abuse. Yeah. And to tell other people outside of the system and watch their eyes get wide and say, they did what to you? They did. And those people who don\u0027t know my story, I was sexually abused by a pastor and then blamed by the church and.kicked out for it. That\u0027s the short story. And so, you know, to hear people, to tell my story, not in those words, actually taking much more responsibility. For what happened and then look at me and say they did what and I\u0027m like, why are you not saying? Why did you do that? Yeah And it\u0027s just so important to have those other people So those are some of the immediate things that come to mind when I think of what people are doing I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a much better list, but those are some immediate things when Katherine: people are processing their story in the aftermath?What [00:23:00] percentage of folks or what? range of folks It\u0027s that process their story, but not just the story of the abuse, because I\u0027m thinking of another domain that this might resuscitate is, is your past and like, Oh, what happened in your childhood that like brought you to this place and how. How are, I mean, I know that that happened for me of, of knowing that the trauma that I was experiencing in the church, because it was so similar to what I experienced in my family, that I was severely, not only traumatized in real time, but I was also being re traumatized, and having to balance that.So, yeah, what percentage of people were, were it impacts their entire life story, not just that part? Connie: I, I don\u0027t see Always, never, every, but I will say 99. 9%. Yes. Katherine: I\u0027m not going to say every person, but I\u0027m going to say most people. Connie: Yeah, pretty much every person. Yeah. Part of it [00:24:00] is because we bring, this is part of brain science, is we bring our paradigm, our neuropathways for positive and for negative to every situation we encounter.And so if we\u0027re, if, If power and control dynamics are already familiar, and if you\u0027re raised in conservative religion, they are. They can\u0027t not be. And the more conservative and fundamentalist, in my view, the more power and control dynamics come into play in the institution and the world view, those are deeply familiar and viewed as positive.And so you, how would you not step foot? Yeah, into a system that loves power and control and eventually misuses it. And so to me, and you don\u0027t understand those dynamics. I mean, you just don\u0027t, you don\u0027t get that when you\u0027re [00:25:00] raised like that. This is, you know, the Bible says, God says, the pastor says it\u0027s, it is.What\u0027s considered by everybody to be incredibly positive, helpful you know, the right thing. And so to bring that, the, all those neural pathways that form a worldview and you put trauma, most of us, 99. 9 percent of us have either trauma with a capital T or a lowercase T in childhood and adolescence, you don\u0027t survive this life without.Massive jolts as a child or adolescent. So then you create worldviews. Around those, you\u0027re bringing them into the next, if they\u0027re not processed well, and most of us take our lifetime to process these well, and that\u0027s not discouraging, that\u0027s just realistic, but we usually don\u0027t have it all processed at 20 years old, and, no, we don\u0027t have it all processed then, and so we\u0027re bringing even previous trauma, and the [00:26:00] familiar feel of how that got there, and, So, yes, we\u0027re, it is, I have yet to sit with a person for very long and say, Oh, this is the sole thing we\u0027re talking about.I don\u0027t even remember ever doing that. It\u0027s like, okay, we\u0027re talking about this, but they start saying, Oh, my gosh, this was a replication of this situation in my childhood. Yes, it was. It\u0027s what we do. And there\u0027s no, there\u0027s no shame in that. It\u0027s just what, it\u0027s how our brains work for better and for worse.This is, I mean, you know, us therapists deal with pathology, but our brain has also given us all kinds of survival tools, how we cope through all of that. So, Katherine: yeah, and those things can sometimes even help to like the process of just like recognizing that something is helping us recognize something is wrong or helping us helping us wake up.And that that those experiences are can also be just really Can be helpful and [00:27:00] and our resources that we can tap into as we are in that healing process, and I don\u0027t want to skip over the healing process as we jump into thriving so I just want to create a disclaimer of like when we talk about thriving.This is, this is like. A way to just provide some future hope. Not as a way to put pressure. We\u0027re not saying you need to be here or you need to be here at a certain time. Connie: In fact, some people shouldn\u0027t be here yet. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don\u0027t want them to arrive yet. Right. Right. You know, it\u0027s, that would, you know, and I use physical metaphors all the time, but that\u0027s like, you know, when I was going through cancer and treatment saying you need to start training for a marathon girl.No, no, it\u0027s not Katherine: that\u0027s the need to get through your day. That\u0027s what Connie: exactly survive today. Make sure you\u0027re getting something in your stomach. Make sure your nausea meds, you know, whatever it [00:28:00] means. It\u0027s not time to do a marathon, but we\u0027re talking about a level. Of robust health in the future that\u0027s possible and that\u0027s where I just yeah, I, I remember at the retreat.I said, how many of you know, I said, how, how does us talking about thriving land or something to that effect because I knew there were going to be people that are going, Oh, shut up. I don\u0027t want to keep flagging. I\u0027m like, and, and good for you. That\u0027s right. Because your system is telling you this is premature and.And just take it as that. Say, yeah, I\u0027ll hear this, you know, have, listen to these two yapping about thriving. But I also think it could be, it\u0027s a hopeful beacon too, to say, you\u0027re going to be able to. And, and some of you listening, I know are, are either on the verge or starting to say, I think I\u0027m past survival mode and it will be your time to hear some of this.Yeah. And, Katherine: and one of the, the markers [00:29:00] of trauma is feeling stuck. And have this vision of like, it will not always be this way. There is a time in the future where you will laugh again, and you will thrive. That can help unstuck us. And that\u0027s the point of this. This episode not to say you should drive. No.Why aren\u0027t you thriving yet? Absolutely not. No, no. Connie: I\u0027m so glad we\u0027re talking about that because yeah, it\u0027s like, no, some of you, and I think it\u0027d be, it\u0027s great for people even right now to take a breath and say, how do I feel about this topic? What? And most of the time, what mixed feelings? It used to, we\u0027re not one way or the other, but what mixed feelings do I have about this topic?And to just, you know, welcome all of those feelings about it and, and honor them as we talk, Katherine: and if you, and if you feel like. This is where you, you leave us and you need to [00:30:00] pause the episode and come back in a few months or a few years. You\u0027re, you can do, you can do that. Connie: Please do that. Exactly. Katherine: Absolutely.With that, what\u0027s thriving Connie: and how do we get there? What is thriving? Well, you know, there\u0027s all kinds of ways to define it. But of course, I, MarkerConnie: a bit of a nerd, you know, just kind of, I\u0027m thinking, what is the definition? And I went to, you know, some good old dictionary, standard dictionary definitions, and I like them.To grow or develop vigorously. Isn\u0027t that a great word? Oh, I love it. To prosper or flourish. Oh, I like the word flourish. Yes, isn\u0027t that beautiful? To do particularly well under specified conditions. That\u0027s another one I loved about. Oh, that\u0027s Yes to do particularly well under specified, you know, because then that gives us options to say [00:31:00] Kinda like a plant.What specific plant food does that plant need? Does it need more light? Less light? Does it need more water, less lot water and to, to allow ourselves, I think the individuality of healing and then thriving needs to be honored. Mm-Hmm. It is not a prescription. Okay. I mean, how often Catherine, you know, this happens.My, my clients are like, how long is it gonna take me to get better? Give me, give me a time frame. Okay, we\u0027ve been doing this Katherine: for a while. Let\u0027s, let\u0027s Connie: Yeah, let\u0027s First of all, with the physical body, it\u0027s much easier to do that, and there are still, you know, doctors still fudge and say, well, you could be up and around in three days, or it could be up to like three months, you know?I mean, there\u0027s, even in the physical body, There are those, this doesn\u0027t always everybody, everybody\u0027s body doesn\u0027t do it the same and you put that in a [00:32:00] brain in a, in a neurological system and the variables are huge. So I just want everybody to, you know, be able to say, this is my journey. I mean, the downside is we can\u0027t say, okay, process your story and month one.Do this in month two, you know, it doesn\u0027t work like that. First of all life happens, right? I mean, yeah So and so to come back and just honor This is my path and something you said earlier to we often feel very stuck in trauma recovery But most of the time and I will say this is most I would say but I would say 19 out of 20 Times when my clients say I\u0027m stuck.I\u0027m like, oh, okay That\u0027s kind of that\u0027s important to look at are you stuck? So let\u0027s take a look. So are you? Exactly where you were a year ago. Oh, no. Not, oh gosh, [00:33:00] no. Oh. Then maybe this isn\u0027t stuck. They hate this. Cause, especially the ones who\u0027ve been with me a while. I feel stuck. Don\u0027t say it. I know. Yeah, don\u0027t say it, because it\u0027s just taking longer than we want to.Yes, we would like to feel better tomorrow, thank you very much. It\u0027s like, so, so, to honor the fact that this takes time, and often if we\u0027re not moving quick enough, we say, I\u0027m stuck. And I\u0027m like, it feels like stuck, but let\u0027s look at actual progress and sometimes I\u0027ll say, are you exactly the same place you were even three months ago.No, Connie, I\u0027m not, you know, I mean, they\u0027re like, whatever, but I want to honor the stuck feeling because it is there, but let\u0027s not call it actual stuck because that\u0027s actually not where we\u0027re at. So how did we get here? Catherine, Katherine: we were talking about, Oh, I don\u0027t know, but I was really chocked up. Connie: [00:34:00] Good.Good. So I just want to go driving. And Katherine: how do we get there? What is, yeah, what does driving look like? And then how do we, how do we get there? That was the original Connie: question. Good. Okay. So what\u0027s thriving? I think that looks different too, for different people. And it\u0027s going to look different than it did before.That\u0027s the other thing. I think we need to accept and kind of reconcile. In ourself, sometimes it is going to look like like the name of the treat was retreat was laugh again, and it\u0027s like eventually laughter needs to be another part of your life again, the ability to laugh hard and laugh freely, but even the laughter and what it\u0027s about the texture may feel different than it did before.And that\u0027s not all bad. Most people when they are really starting to thrive will say. Of [00:35:00] course, I hate what I had to go through, but I actually like me better now. Mm hmm. What, what bigger success is there than that? To me, that\u0027s, and I know that\u0027s my story. It took me 10 years in a very dramatic moment. I write an epilogue in my book, a very dramatic moment.For me to go, Oh, I like who I am and not that it was right that it happened, but there\u0027s, I think it was evil that what happened to me and it should never happen to anybody, but there was a part of me that said that has made me who I am and my gratitude for that was profound and I find that\u0027s pretty consistent and so it\u0027s maybe different.And it likely is going to be different, thriving, than what it used to look like. But I also think thriving is going to have greater dimension, and wealth, and color, than it did before. And that, [00:36:00] that\u0027s, to me, that\u0027s the beauty of suffering handled well. Like you actually get in suffering. I am not Again, don\u0027t hear me saying woohoo for suffering No, a lot of it is needless and should never be there and I don\u0027t wish it on anyone that said I feel like beauty can come from that and Healing and not just okay.I\u0027m better like, okay. I got over it But a sense of oh who am I now that I really love that I didn\u0027t have Parts of me before that are here. Katherine: Yeah. Yeah. It\u0027s a, it\u0027s a a hurdle to get past this like reality of like, yes, this should have never happened. Yeah. Yes. And, and, and this is a, this is a churchy word, this is a Jesus word, but it\u0027s also just a word.I see that rather than like, Oh, justification for what happened or a reason for what happened and rather like a redemption. [00:37:00] Yes. Get to step into. And now we get to claim and we get to say this happened. Yes. But despite it, this is now who I am. Yes. Yes. Resiliency of the survival spirit and the human spirit that is ours to access.Yes. And that abuser or abusive system does not get the final word. Connie: No. We do. That\u0027s right. And that where I love that\u0027s so funny. I I was thinking I hope she\u0027s gonna use the word redemption Because you know the church has Hijacked the word and stolen in many ways and made it its own domain its own territory.It\u0027s not There\u0027s something beautiful about something that word Yes, they don\u0027t own it and for us to say no something could be redeemed something Some beauty could come out of something horrible. And I think that is, that is apart [00:38:00] from and across religious perspective. That\u0027s, that\u0027s just one of those, that\u0027s a, that\u0027s an existential life thing.And it\u0027s like, let it, let it, let it be there. So, you know, part of, we talked about this at the retreat, Catherine, but part of thriving, first of all, I think, to, we need to see our all or nothing assumptions. Around thriving, we, we often, I think, especially when we\u0027re hurting and trying to heal and trying to survive, we see thriving as a light switch.That\u0027s going to pop on 1 day. And, oh, now I\u0027m thriving and even as I say that, most of us who live past. Probably 18 years old, we\u0027ll say probably doesn\u0027t work quite that way, but it\u0027s an underlying assumption that it\u0027s going to be. All better, that all domains of [00:39:00] life will be thriving at the same time, and that it is a steady, straight line toward thriving.This, this, this, these steps, and you\u0027re on it. It is a crazy, twisted, three dimensional graph. And it\u0027s, you know, if we\u0027re saying straight line on a graph toward thriving, It\u0027s a mess. It\u0027s a snarled mess to get there. And there are going to be areas, I would venture to say that even the people who are hurting the most listening to this right now have areas of their life that they are actually thriving.They may not be willing to look real carefully at that because it might feel invalidating, which it\u0027s not but, but to be able to actually there are certain areas of my life that are kind of on track. I mean, my husband and I started dating [00:40:00] fully recommended six months after I was went through the abuse.It actually was exactly what it should have been for us. Yeah, again, not necessarily recommended. But. We, that part of my life was very beautiful while I was bleeding out arteries in so many other domains of my life. Does that make my time with, you know, my courtship and my, even that has a lot of baggage to it, our dating years, whatever, you know, dating time less valuable?Or less than? No, it was actually quite a shining light. Does it make my other suffering less? No, it was horrific. And so, just to, just to look at that and to say, it\u0027s not an all or nothing proposition. And it does to hold that lightly and accept the fact that It\u0027s, it\u0027s not going to be an [00:41:00] all or nothing where all of a sudden one day life is just going to be all easier and all better.Yeah. Katherine: Yeah. Yeah. And I think I really appreciated that visual picture that you provided us at the retreat where you gave us domains on a piece of paper and it was just like a bunch of different blocks of different domains, family, social life, work life, spiritual life, all these different domains. Yeah.And, and you said something to the effect of you can be thriving and have a few of these domains that aren\u0027t thriving. Like you can be thriving in general and then have a few domains that aren\u0027t going so well. And that was like a relief to me because I think I pictured thriving as everything is going great all the time.Connie: Right. Well, I have 12. I think of this the cat out. We\u0027re talking about I give up 12 domains and these are very flexible. These were [00:42:00] my domains. And I said, I remember saying that retreat and people can say, that\u0027s not even a domain for me, or I got different domains. And that\u0027s great. But these 12 domains, let me.Let me go through them real quick because I want to kind of talk about this. Is that okay? Katherine: Yeah, and then maybe I could get, if you have like a PDF or something, I can put it in the newsletter. If they, if I remember, I probably won\u0027t, but no, I have Connie: it. I have it. I couldn\u0027t get that to you. Yeah. So one domain is spiritual health when they\u0027re getting, I kind of referred to some of these earlier physical health.Emotional mental health, of course, isn\u0027t that great that I\u0027d forget that one emotional mental health. That\u0027s the third. And then it in relationships is the domain of family, your significant other friendships. That\u0027s huge. And that can include community like we\u0027re talking fun and recreation creativity.Excuse me creativity adventure are all part of the fun and recreation and then I have a set that I don\u0027t know if anybody else uses, but I [00:43:00] love learning and skill building. I loved I\u0027m a learner my heart. So I love like, what am I doing in that domain? My environment my home, my office, my car.How\u0027s that? You know, how are things there in my environment? And then. I\u0027ve got finances. How are my finances? That\u0027s a domain. Work and career. How am I making a living? How\u0027s that going? That domain. And then I have a, my last domain is life contribution. And that, that, of course these areas overlap greatly.You know, they\u0027re not separate, but just for the sake of sorting. So my life contribution, what do I do just to contribute to this world? You know, and those are ways you do it in other domains as well, but I have it for me because well, I\u0027m in a better place Yes, and I\u0027m an Enneagram three So I forgive me even now so it just [00:44:00] is so when I look at all of these domains I have never That I recall in my whole life on a scale from 0 to 10, 10 being best ever, 5 being neutral, 0 being in the toilet.I have never been above between a 6 and a 10 in all these domains at one given time. There\u0027s always a path, there\u0027s always, it\u0027s a Katherine: neutral. But you would say you\u0027re still thriving. You would say. Yes. Yeah. Even if that\u0027s not, not everything is a Connie: 10. Exactly. I, I\u0027ve got a domain right now that is chronically painful.There\u0027s some stuff family wise, chronically, like, ow, like if it, if it gets to a 3. 5, it\u0027s a good day in that domain. So it\u0027s a painful domain. I want to honor that. Like, yeah, that is [00:45:00] real and it hurts. And it doesn\u0027t hurt less because several other parts of my life are actually above six and, and thriving.And so just to give that example, I think about a time in my life when I was going through cancer where multiple domains Were like, finances, physical health, career, trying to keep together a private practice, all these domains were like in distress. And the friend domain was just freaky rich. It was just like, Oh, I would just add such gratitude around that.So a lot of domains in that time of life, it was. Below a five, but the, the upside was the friendships were just so beautiful and good. So I guess. I want to take away the illusion that thriving means everything is in the positive. [00:46:00] Katherine: Yeah. As we wrap up, if someone is listening to this and they\u0027re like, Okay, I think I\u0027m curling out of that survival, and I\u0027m, you know, my head\u0027s kind of coming up and I\u0027m able to just maybe see a little bit of sunshine.What, what are some recommendations, resources that you would recommend to that person to start moving towards coming out of that survival space?Connie: One of the first things I can think of, and there again, I don\u0027t want this to be triggering because it can have some baggage with it, but this is brain science. This is not religion. And that is gratitude. I think reinforcement of what is actually going well. First of all, to allow validation for all the stuff that\u0027s hurting, like, we have this Western mindset that it\u0027s got to be one cancels [00:47:00] out the other.It\u0027s both and, that\u0027s life. But to go with gratitude, no shoulds here, what should I be grateful for? Get that out of your head. But what are you actually grateful for and if you\u0027re moving toward that thriving, I think that can really reinforce it I have a practice every morning of writing anywhere from six to ten things that i\u0027m thankful for right then no shoulds That\u0027s the big rule.Should I be grateful for that? If I have to ask the question, it\u0027s not going on the list like So, no, but what am I actually, and some days that means I am actually grateful for a warm house. It\u0027s supposed to have a cold snap here in the Northwest over the next couple of days. And I\u0027m like, okay, I actually am grateful for this warm house.Great. So to, to keep facilitating that, that\u0027s one of the first things that comes to mind. And voicing those neural pathways, a traumatized brain has deeply rutted, [00:48:00] painful and negative neural pathways. It just has such, there\u0027s such ruts of just the anxiety of waiting for the next shoe to fall, to, to, for the next bomb to go off, and to start saying, I\u0027m going to reinforce.We\u0027re not getting rid of the risk of hard things happening, it\u0027s real. But to say, actually at the same time, these positive things are very true. They\u0027re just as true as the negative. This is a little quote fight I get in with my clients sometimes. Okay, it\u0027s not a fight. But to say, you know, you\u0027re saying all this negative is true.I agree, it is. And even the possibilities of negative are the truth. I can\u0027t say that wouldn\u0027t happen. But what about all the positive as well? It\u0027s an integrating of those rather than it\u0027s not Pollyanna. It\u0027s not rose colored glasses. It\u0027s an integrating [00:49:00] of actual reality and our brains say, Nope, only the negative is true.And I\u0027m like, let\u0027s challenge that because that eventually becomes unhelpful. For our brains, and so somehow reinforcing telling people about the positive, the ones who are also validating the negative, not ones who are pushing you, Katherine: you\u0027re going to celebrate with you and can hold the both Connie: hand with you.Exactly, without toxic positivity, we do not want that, but so to keep moving there, I think social, you know, we talked about the challenges of. Friendships and community both of those. And I think those are a little different because you can have really good individual friendships without a full sense of robust community.Yeah, but those things help reinforce positive brain function. I mean, we just do better. unisolated. We do better connected with other humans. And so those are some, and there again, be gentle, [00:50:00] take time. It\u0027s just not going to happen overnight. And that\u0027s, it\u0027s a sometimes grueling road back, but worth it.It\u0027s worth the time and effort to say, Okay, well that friendship didn\u0027t go exactly like I wanted. I\u0027m going to keep trying to create and develop positive connections. And I think also we\u0027re talking about spiritual, you cannot push this, but I want to give hope. I\u0027m 30 years down. And so I feel like I have this perspective and I started what they called deconstructing 20 years ago.I didn\u0027t know what was happening to me, my spiritual life, my brain, nobody had a name for it back then. I was just freaking out going, I\u0027m pulling back, I\u0027m pulling back. Is this bad? Oh my gosh, am I going to hell? Ah, you know, and I started. Questioning deeply all this stuff. So I\u0027ve been on this process a long time and there are months and years that you are going to live in limbo in that in, and it\u0027s, it is [00:51:00] so damn uncomfortable.It is. It is so uncomfortable and it is so essential that you do not rush through it. Yes, cut the process short. Yeah, but let me say sit with it in integrity you do finally come out on the other side not not with certainty I don\u0027t think certainty, but I think I can say with some solid ground to stand on I think that\u0027s a better way to put it just personally whatever that is for you you start If you don\u0027t circumvent the process, if you don\u0027t, you know, truncate the process, then you can move on eventually to go, Oh, I think I\u0027m finding some solid ground.For me, that was years of limbo. It was unpleasant. It isn\u0027t for everybody. My brain works slower. It had several decades to rewrite. So it took a long time, but it was so worth it to say, no, you are, there\u0027s hope for [00:52:00] some solid ground existentially slash spiritually, not they\u0027re going to, I\u0027m not, I\u0027m not even interested in certainty anymore but a certain definition of who I am and how I relate to life in the divine.Katherine: Absolutely. Absolutely. Oh, I feel like this, this conversation has been kind of like a, it feels like a little pep talk. I feel inspired and yeah, just, encouraged. And I want this episode to end January spiritual abuse awareness month as just kind of like hope, but not hope of trying to put pressure on anyone to be here, but just to say.One day, one day, you\u0027re gonna be able to laugh again. One day, this limbo, five years, ten years, whatever, you\u0027re gonna look back and it\u0027s gonna be over, like this part will be over, or this, this, this. Season of Connie: this part will be over. [00:53:00] Yes, exactly. Katherine: Right. Yes. This has been so wonderful. I always, always enjoy talking to you as Connie: Catherine.Yes. Katherine: And the end of the episode, let folks know how to get in touch with you or find. Stuff that you are, you are working on. Connie: Yes. So let me get my book out. So I remember the exact title. The title traumatized by spiritual abuse, courage, hope and freedom for survivors. That\u0027s it. And then another subtitle is discover the cultures and systems of religious abuse and reclaim your personal power.So that\u0027s on the front of the book. That gives a bit, a bit of a Idea a range of what is in the book and get it on Amazon. So Connie Baker my website has almost. Everything you need on there Connie A. Baker, C O N N I E A as in Ann, my middle name, then baker, B A K E R dot com, Connie A. Baker dot com.It\u0027s got resources, videos, [00:54:00] probably has this podcast, a podcast I was on before with you. So, resources for people to listen to or look up and, yeah, I think those are the main I\u0027m I\u0027m on Facebook. Come on. Oh, I do have here. This is important. I do have a group of probably I think it\u0027s around right above 1000 people right now and online private.Yeah, I didn\u0027t. Oh, good. Yeah. And and I post regularly. And just to right now I\u0027m giving a lot of questions for people to process their story. So that is overcoming Yeah, yeah, yeah. Overcoming religious abuse community. And that\u0027s on Facebook and I\u0027m also on Instagram and Connie a baker is usually the handles on those to Katherine: find it.Yes. All right. Thank you so much. I will link as many things as possible in the show notes for folks. And thank you so much for being here and Connie: always, always a privilege. Thank you, Catherine. Thank you.",

      "title": "S5:E2 - Spiritual Abuse Awareness Month: What Survivors Need from a Therapist - with Rachel Bernstein",
      "description": "Rachel Bernstein LMFT, MSEd discusses what it\u2019s like working with survivors from high-control groups. This episode is for survivors looking for a mental health professional or for mental health professionals looking to work with the demographic of survivors of cults, high-control groups, and spiritual abuse. University of SalfordTranscript (Transcript is unedited for typos and misspellings)Katherine: Hello. How are you doing today?Rachel:  I am doing really good. How are you doing today? Katherine: I am good. I am a little tired. I went to a midnight book release. On Monday nights, and I don\u0027t ever stay up that late, and I\u0027m still sleeping.That was a new thing for me. I was like, this is what teenagers do. These are not what people who are almost 40 do. But it was fun. It was a fun experience. I\u0027m glad. Very excited to talk to you today. I know you have indoctrination podcast, and you do a lot of different work with a lot of different clients, but the particular demographic that I would [00:01:00] love to talk to you about is the demographic of folks who\u0027ve And cults or high control experiences.And I would love to hear from you, what prompted you to work with this demographic and what was the story that led you to working with this type Rachel: of client? Nice. Okay. So there\u0027s so much to this story. I\u0027ll try not to make it overly long, but Okay, great. No, go for it. Tell, tell, tell whatever. It\u0027s slightly long, longer than it needs to be, not overly.Right. Huh. Right. So, When I was growing up, my, one of my siblings who was eight years older got. Kind of a new friend through a friend, and they started hanging out a lot. Next thing we know, she\u0027s not really spending time at home. She has taken the money out of her [00:02:00] account and it\u0027s gone.Which she had really worked hard for. In my family, we were supposed to work from when we were young. If we needed cash for anything, even to go to the movies, well, you need to earn it. You know, it was like that. So it, you know, we didn\u0027t take spending lots of money all at once lightly. Cause we know how much we had worked to make it and suddenly liquidated gone.And she was speaking differently. She was acting in a very kind of in your face way. And we\u0027re like, what is going on? So then she said that she has this friend of a friend who\u0027s introduced her to this place. It\u0027s called Scientology. Got it. And and it\u0027s a church, but we\u0027re a Jewish family, but it\u0027s not a church church.That would, that became a line in our family forever. It\u0027s not a church church. Like what? I\u0027m sorry. It\u0027s not a church church, but it\u0027s not. So. Because there really wasn\u0027t the idea of a word cult that was known at the time, and this was in the 70s. So there [00:03:00] was no one to call. There were no resources that, you know, the books out there at the time before the interwebs, the, the books were written by cult leaders.Like there were L. Ron Hubbard novels out there about Dianetics and his science fiction books, but nothing about what is Scientology and that it is a cult. And the, the cult books that were out there too, were more about like working with POWs who had been indoctrinated and watching the Manchurian candidate and are like, yeah, fit, but not.So the turning point was. And I learned a lot about this. My, my parents responded different ways to stressful events. My mom was more of a kind of in your face, you have to stop this right now, finger pointing. I mean, that, that does sometimes come in handy, right? And my father instead was the, let me link arms with this person, see what they like about it, see what\u0027s interesting to them.But also I want to ask my questions about what I\u0027m concerned about. So, They had tension and [00:04:00] she had tension with my parents and she said this group is going to teach me how to get along better with, with all of you. And And my friend said she\u0027s gotten along better with her parents since she\u0027s gotten involved.And so my father, in a very nice way, said could we call her parents and find out? Like, if this really has helped, then I\u0027ll say, okay. And she got the number of this person and their parents and the parents said, in this kind of panic tone, where did you see our daughter? Whoa. Right? That was a whoa.And my dad goes, what do you mean? We haven\u0027t, we don\u0027t know where she is. She left home six months ago and she said for the last six months she\u0027s been getting along better with her parents. She hasn\u0027t seen them. So this is the way the group defined getting along better, right? No contact. Katherine: No contact. Rachel: Cut them off.Oh my. That actually startled my sister. She didn\u0027t know. She didn\u0027t know [00:05:00] that\u0027s what that meant. I\u0027m sorry. And she tried to get her money back. That was impossible, but. That you could see the personality change right away, and you could see that being in your face and she was having problems with her friends at school for the first time, too, because she was learning other ways of communicating the Scientology way of communicating, which is very in your face.So that became dinner table conversation. How can this happen that people can just take over someone\u0027s mind and convince them that something is true. That\u0027s really not true. That\u0027s totally the opposite of what is true. And then. Because I then was raised hearing about this and that there are many groups that do their recruiting also on college campuses, and they use front names, I then went to college, and I saw it.I saw these groups with their front names that I had learned, and they\u0027re at the student union, you know, passing out their pamphlets having people join, taking them on weekends, the bus picked up in front of my dorm, and I remember, because I was now cult educated, [00:06:00] I said to these people, Where are you going?And they said, Oh, we\u0027re going on a church weekend. What church is it? We don\u0027t know. Really? You don\u0027t know. And where are you going? Well, we\u0027re going to the mountains. I go, you know, that\u0027s not a place like mountains are these geographical structures and geological entities. That\u0027s not a place. Do you know where you\u0027re going?Is there going to be a phone there? Like, how are you going to leave? And they just thought I was being a drag. And I remember the leaders coming on the bus and asking me who I was and why I was harassing the people who were going. But I thought some of them are going to be dropping out of school after this and needing to show their devotion to this group and not school because that\u0027s what would happen.Suddenly these people were gone. Yeah. And then. So there are just two more parts of this story, and it really is, this is a shorter version. When I then went on to grad school to become, to, to become a therapist, to learn [00:07:00] counseling, there was a, a group therapy course where you learn to do group therapy that turned out to be run like a cult.The leader of it, who was the teacher, used, utilized almost every technique of influence and manipulation. And that was just her personality and I did a social experiment in that class, which was interesting because I noticed. This was the year before my dad passed away the year before I broke up with my boyfriend the year before my favorite dog passed away like I was just on the cusp of going through lots of trauma.Yeah, but until then life had been okay, but we were supposed to share our traumas. And if we didn\u0027t have trauma to share like if we hadn\u0027t gone through abuse or something, we were withholding, we were being resistant to the process. And then I could see people folding like I could see them making stories up just to be liked.And then they would be hugged by the people in the group. Thank you for [00:08:00] trusting us with your trauma and with your, with your past. So people were just crafting stories to please the teacher. I thought, wow, this is happening in a therapy class. I remember talking to my Dean about that. He was actually a little alarmed and I did one of my, I did my dissertation on what happened in that class for that school.That was controversial. But then I, I thought, you know, I want to do this work because there were so few resources for people and. I, yes, I want to do general counseling. I still do some general counseling, but about 80 percent of the counts counseling I do is former cult stuff. And then I start that they were looking for a clinician at a place called the cult clinic in Los Angeles, which was effectively shut down by Scientology.But that was my first taste of harassment, Scientology harassment, which did scare me. I mean, they had. discredited LAPD officers that they hired to harass people to follow people. They were scary, [00:09:00] scary mofos, if I can say. Leaning on my car when I\u0027d come out of the office following me home sending people into poses clients.And I get this note saying, just to let you know, we\u0027re watching and listening and thought, what the hell is this? And so I remember staying home for about a week, my father had passed about a year before this, and suddenly I heard his words, which were, you can\u0027t let the bullies win. That was his way of looking at the world like you cannot let the bullies win.And I thought, Okay, but I need a week. I just have a week. I\u0027m like talking to him wherever he is. He\u0027s already passed. And I had to get myself together and See what my rights were. Yes, we\u0027re not. Take a little break, right? Yes, we\u0027re not letting them win, but I do need a break. I need a break, because they\u0027re outside my house, and I need to know if I\u0027ll be protected.I need to contact the police. And then I went back to work, and I thought, what I\u0027m dealing with in terms of harassment is only slightly what former Scientologists deal [00:10:00] with. And other people from other groups. They\u0027re pretty intense. Yeah. Scientologists are very intense. Really intense. Katherine: Stopping them is intense, right?Mm hmm. Rachel: Yeah, yeah. They\u0027ve complained to my board many times to try to have my license taken away. They, they\u0027re no nonsense, but it\u0027s what happens to me and to a couple of my, you know, colleagues. And, and I think to me, especially because where I started doing my work, my counseling was very close to the Scientology buildings in Hollywood.So I started working with a lot of Scientologists and have continued working with them. So they don\u0027t like me, but okay. So that\u0027s, that\u0027s sort of how I got started in this. So yeah. And then how many years would you say Katherine: that this has been like the folks? Is it kind of been from the Rachel: beginning? Yeah, it\u0027s been since I\u0027ve been doing counseling.It\u0027s been 32 years and it\u0027s morphed over time in that before it really was. It was, I thought this was fascinating. [00:11:00] This was a human rights issue to me, especially the way in a lot of these groups that women were treated and children were treated or mistreated, neglected and, and then over time it morphed to include now people who have been in relationships with narcissists because I would do a talk on cults or something and someone would call me and say, that sounds like my husband.Oh, what do you mean? And I kind of learned from people responding to my words about cult saying, no, that was my family that or that was my relationship. So I realized to now with. You know, with political landscape and so many people having polarized views of things and group think that I think is very scary.That\u0027s happening right now in the world to that I care about this on a micro level and also macro that. As the descendant of Holocaust survivors, I\u0027m, I care a lot about group think and how people can be, kind of, how you get to Katherine: that place. It Rachel: doesn\u0027t Right. Caught up into a ffr, the [00:12:00] torch and pitchfork way of Right.And then also still on the micro person by person listening to what they\u0027ve been through and trying to help them individually. Katherine: Mm-Hmm. Two, two observations. First of all. I noticed that when you were talking to those people who were getting on this bus to go to the quote unquote mountains, and that your father\u0027s approach to your sister, a lot of questions, there was like a lot of asking questions and I sure I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll get into that.In just a minute, but I, I noticed that and then also I do appreciate that you address the fact that like a narcissistic relationship can have that similarity because I feel like I know like in the world that I work in, we have a much better, a broader. view of like what a cult can be, what a high control relationship can be, and what a high control religion can be.But most folks [00:13:00] still think of a cult as like something happening in a bunker somewhere, or out in the desert, and Expanding what that can be and what that high control relationship can be. And there are so many people who experienced that, but then have that very, just invalidating experience of like, nobody knows what this is like.It feels like a cult, but I can\u0027t call it a cult because it doesn\u0027t look like this. And, and so I appreciate that. You made that connection between that narcissist and that cold, cold experience. The impact can be very, very similar. Rachel: The impact is very similar.I think because not every cult is run by a narcissist. Some really are. You know, they have their delusional disorder and they get people into this diagnosis that is called fully I do, which is shared psychosis. Like they invite people who are maybe vulnerable to that way of thinking into their psychosis, but by [00:14:00] and large, I\u0027d say a good 90 percent of cult leaders have a narcissistic bent.And so then. Whether it\u0027s your partner, your parent, even your child, there\u0027s some people who contact me because their children are narcissistic and run their life. Because that it\u0027s the same disorder that\u0027s prompting it, you\u0027re going to have similar techniques. Like they\u0027ve read the same manual. It\u0027s kind of amazing.And, and then when you have similar techniques of, of manipulation, gaslighting, all of it, you\u0027re going to have similar outcomes. So it could be a one on one situation or it could be hundreds of thousands of people. Katherine: Yeah, and that can be helpful for someone who is recovering from that type of relationship, like even looking for someone who has the high control experience when they are looking for a mental health professional.Right. That would be maybe not necessarily just a narcissistic relationship, but someone who has that experience might be able to relate with that a little more. One of the things that\u0027s unique about your story is you didn\u0027t get into [00:15:00] this demographic because you had a personal experience being in a cult.So I think that\u0027s really unique. I feel like everyone that I know who gets into this demographic also had an experience. In it makes your story very unique to me, but then also, what are some things that you have learned over the years from your clients about what they need for Rachel: recovery? Right. It\u0027s a great question.So yes. And it, it is unique that I haven\u0027t. Been in one myself, and I think that\u0027s why I work almost equally with the families and friends of people who are in situations like this or in relational situations like this and have a webinar for them too, because I was. One of those, like being on the outside, needing to figure out how to have these conversations, how to manage the anxiety that comes up when you see your loved one getting slowly stolen away from you.And you don\u0027t [00:16:00] know what this forces that\u0027s on them and how to. See if you can get them back and if it\u0027s even possible and learning about the ways to communicate that are in a kind of counterintuitive way that are specific for this has been something I noticed from my own family, but also now for further doing this work and learning about that.So, right. I mean, what. People need. It\u0027s interesting when you talk about doing this kind of counseling for the people specifically who were in situations like this, whether it is a cult or a relationship that took over their life, multi level marketing, abusive teen treatment place, whatever it was, or is, or having been with a therapist who was dangerous, which I talk about a lot.I, well, it\u0027s unconscionable to me. To use that power in that way makes me mad. And so there are, [00:17:00] there are some things that. Are really important. I think for specifically when people are coming out of this, they need to know that they\u0027re believed because so often they\u0027re made to feel that they\u0027re exaggerating the story or they didn\u0027t get it right.That\u0027s part of the gaslighting that they can\u0027t trust the evidence of their senses and how they are deciphering what happened. And they also will often underplay it. And really downgrade how much they\u0027ve been traumatized because it wasn\u0027t supposed to be seen that way in the group like you\u0027re supposed to just deal with being abused, or you\u0027re, it\u0027s for your benefit.You\u0027re supposed to be appreciative of being treated that way, being selected for something that turned out to be abusive. So. Abuse, neglect get underreported a lot of the time by people who leave. And what helps is defining for them what they\u0027ve been through. Like, Oh, [00:18:00] that actually is abuse. That\u0027s why you\u0027re having nightmares.That\u0027s why you break into a cold sweat when you hear someone who has similar voice to the person who did that to you. I want you to understand yourself and your reactions, and you\u0027ll only understand it if you know what happened to you. And also that it wasn\u0027t your fault. That you didn\u0027t bring it in, that it wasn\u0027t because of you.Because, you know, within a cultic system, as you know, anything that\u0027s good that happens to you is because of the leadership. Anything that\u0027s bad is because of you. Katherine: And because you didn\u0027t Rachel: follow the leadership. Right, because you didn\u0027t follow the leadership. You, or you weren\u0027t feeling it in your heart or whatever, whatever it is, it\u0027s always back on you.So to be able to have a clear sense of who the culprit is, and you can take it off of you is also a really important thing. It\u0027s also good for people to understand that they have strengths, that they have capabilities. That they can live in the world and be successful at it, even [00:19:00] though they have been told that they don\u0027t have these strengths and these capabilities and to have them understand why they were convinced of that and how that fed the.Need of the leader to have you be dependent on them and to never want to leave because you don\u0027t feel equipped to be in the world. I think helping people understand why they were taught what they were taught and how it wasn\u0027t for them. It was right. It was for the control that the leader or the group needed to have over them.That\u0027s really helpful just to understand the source and the reasoning for the things they were taught as truths about them. And I think it\u0027s really helpful to connect people with other people. That\u0027s why I run a support group. So people don\u0027t feel isolated and alone. And I will often talk to people about how they They are having trouble relaxing and resting because when you\u0027re in a cult, you\u0027re going, going, going, you\u0027re doing, doing, doing, you learn that you matter the [00:20:00] least and you don\u0027t have to sleep.And it\u0027s fine if you\u0027re not eating and you\u0027re, you\u0027re supposed to somehow be devoted to the cause. And I try to shift that in my counseling work. So people know they are also the cause that it\u0027s important for them to take care of them. And that that\u0027s not selfish and it\u0027s not being lazy and it\u0027s not having pride.It\u0027s not all the other things that it\u0027s called when you care about you. And that you have to be a good steward of the self in order to then do work that you might want to do that\u0027s in service of others, but it needs to happen in that order. And there\u0027s nothing wrong with you for doing it in that order.And I also, I guess I want people to know that the world outside is actually not going to be as scary and not going to be as critical and not going to be as gossipy, like they\u0027ll have more privacy. There, there aren\u0027t people who are going to give them a hard time about everything. I have Clients who [00:21:00] panic if they\u0027re running even 30 seconds late for a session, or they come on to a zoom call a little bit late, or they come to the group a little bit late.I\u0027ll sometimes see them in the waiting area on zoom and then they\u0027re gone. They\u0027re missing. And I realized they\u0027re panicking because they\u0027re sure. That I\u0027m going to give them a hard time and I\u0027m going to berate them for not showing their allegiance to this group and not showing that it matters enough for them to be there on time, all the things that they went through in their cultic group.And they\u0027re also They\u0027ve expressed to me they\u0027re worried about not showing up for the group because when they didn\u0027t go to things, that\u0027s when they were talked about in their absence and waited and given a hard time. So they were afraid of walking back into what suddenly felt like an unsafe. Situation.So I let people know we do not talk about you. And if someone does want to talk about you while you\u0027re not here, if it\u0027s something positive, like, oh, it\u0027s so [00:22:00] nice to meet that woman last time. And I hope she comes back. That\u0027s fine. And I\u0027ll be happy to tell you about that. But, you know, someone who just wants to.Berate. Not allowed, not allowed. So it always needs to feel safe. You just, if they\u0027re doing this work and learning from people and what makes them so anxious and you just see how much they\u0027ve been mistreated and how much they\u0027ve been under a microscope that has been so unfair to them and has made them so tense and so worried needlessly.Katherine: Absolutely. So I heard you say. Believe them. Let them know that you believe their story. I heard you say, give them like language to name what happened and then validate even that it was like a big deal, like naming it as abuse or naming it as as gaslighting. I heard you say, help them access.Like the internal [00:23:00] resources that they have and access their own, you didn\u0027t say the word power, but their own, their own resources, their own internal resources reframe things. So learning that like outside world is not scary and, and just having that, like a lot of like compassion for. The trauma that results in anxiety or fear or mistrust or anything like that.All like super, super, super important things. And I just think about like your support groups and like the courage that it takes for someone to show up to something like that when they have, a lot of times it is a group. Right. That happened in the first place. And that can be very scary, yet such a huge part of the recovery process to be able to engage with a group again.And yeah. Oh yeah. Again, Rachel: very, very important. Yeah. There are people also who. [00:24:00] Have been in support groups that have really, really been unhealthy. And also ones where they dealt with being in a treatment center that were kind of patterned. Well, they took off from Synanon, which started this this horrible practice.It was a cult in California started a whole horrible practice of something called the game where. You are supposed to berate people in a group. You\u0027re supposed to shout at them, call them things. They would sometimes need to grovel, like walk around on, on their hands and knees to show that they were they knew they were less than or they needed to wear a sign around them, around their neck that would say something.It could say whore, could say anything and whatever they may have been labeled that day. I mean, it was, so it was attack. Therapy. I don\u0027t even want to call it therapy. And so people coming out of that have interesting reactions when I do counseling with them. [00:25:00] And, and what is one of the reactions that\u0027s kind of sad is that some of them think that I don\u0027t care about them because I\u0027m not shouting at them.Translation. I get that Katherine: though. I, I totally get that. Yeah. Rachel: Yeah. Right. That was the justification for someone being cruel. Like, no, this is for your benefit. And so I remember one person saying, I don\u0027t know if this is going to work because you\u0027ve never raised your voice, but it\u0027s like someone raised by an abusive parent, you know, like this is how I show you that I care.It\u0027s, oh, it\u0027s such a perversion of how it should be. Katherine: No, absolutely. No. And I, I mean that I\u0027m remembering how like I migrated to someone who was like a known abusive pastor in the evangelical world is Mark Driscoll. And I remember migrating to him as a leader because he yelled from the pulpit and because he was so angry from the pulpit.And I had without realizing it been conditioned to see [00:26:00] that a strong, trustworthy leadership in it. I was like very just Very disorienting when I realized that that happens and that I like read into that anger as good leadership. It totally, totally, really. Rachel: Okay. Yeah, it\u0027s really terrible. And people get that they, they then wind up sometimes in relationships with people who are really mistreating them because.That was translated as love. That\u0027s another thing to define. Like, what is love? And what can that look like in a relationship? And what are rights? I mean, I remember one time, I, I was flown to Texas to help with the, the raid, which had already taken place on the FLDS compound. And I, I don\u0027t like raids, even though I\u0027ve worked with a lot of people who did feel traumatized by [00:27:00] them, but also relieved knowing that there were people out there who cared about what was happening behind closed doors.Like it\u0027s very mixed thing. So I wasn\u0027t involved in all planning it, but they asked me to come in to, to help to train the social workers who were working with the people who had been taken off the camp compound even temporarily. And they were talking to these women or young, well, they\u0027re really still girls who are these sister wives about rights, that they had rights.And they were looking blankly and and they said, they, they don\u0027t seem to believe us that they have rights. I said, They don\u0027t know what rights are. We have to go back. We have to teach them that there are these things that are called rights. That, that there is things called boundaries, that you have the right to say no or to control your body.But that\u0027s not true in their group. So they\u0027re not gonna believe you that they have these rights. They probably don\u0027t even know that there\u0027s this thing called a constitution. Mm-Hmm. . [00:28:00] That says that they have rights that are legally protected. And they don\u0027t even Katherine: have a Rachel: concept for it. Right. And that if they were to impose those rights, they would be abused or they would be kicked out.And so it\u0027s not safe for them to have them. So we can\u0027t jump in assuming that they\u0027ve had the same life and same education and same exposure. Like we have to educate them about the fact that these things exist. And that maybe that will help them leave at some point, knowing that these things exist, but only outside the compound.Katherine: Absolutely. Absolutely. And I know that. You and I probably come from the same position of just because someone has a credential doesn\u0027t make them someone as as you as you discovered with these social workers doesn\u0027t make them equipped to work with this demographic. But if someone were to be interested in working with this demographic and wanted to.Equip themselves and get the resources to be able to work with this demographic. [00:29:00] What would you point them to and what would you direct them to? And what are some recommendations for things that they could pursue to become equipped? Rachel: Okay. I think it\u0027s a great thing. And yes, just because someone has, has initials after their name doesn\u0027t make them healthy people.And I have seen that and I\u0027ve seen it for people who have dealt with abuse at the hands of psychiatrists who have an MD and You know have these very advanced degrees, but they have a disorder that makes them totally misbehave. So, and, and there are people who don\u0027t have credentials who I think have been great.So it\u0027s still buyer beware, unfortunately, even it\u0027s, it\u0027s important just to be a smart spiritual consumer and a smart therapeutic. consumer. I think what people also need to know is that now there are a lot of people who are running what they\u0027re calling support groups, and they\u0027re not necessarily credentialed people.And some run a lovely group, but they\u0027re not quite sure what to [00:30:00] do when there is an issue. And they\u0027ll sometimes call me like this happened and then someone felt ganged up on and we started talking about someone. Thinking it would be helpful, but then they felt traumatized and like, it can go down kind of a rabbit hole if there isn\u0027t someone who\u0027s had training in how to run a support group.So you want to go to someone who\u0027s had training and also there are people who have left cults who will sometimes run them as cults. That\u0027s how they manage, right? That\u0027s what they know. Yeah. And then there\u0027s a group of favorites and that, you know, and they feel, they know it and other ones are feeling ostracized.It\u0027s very culty and they\u0027re feeling judged. So see how you feel. Know that if you get involved in a group, that\u0027s not your only option. You can go shopping around, don\u0027t owe them anything. You don\u0027t have to keep coming back if it doesn\u0027t feel safe. There is, this needs to be part of. The curriculum for social work schools.Katherine: Oh, my gosh. Yes, right. It does because it\u0027s [00:31:00] so common. Rachel: It\u0027s it\u0027s so common. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve had the experience. And if you talk about this issue, invariably, when I\u0027m out somewhere and someone asked me what I do, there\u0027s at least one other person who\u0027s going to say, Oh, yeah. I was in something or my family member was like, it happens so frequently now that I think it should be curriculum and for people who are learning to to become therapists of any sort.It\u0027s just really not, and it\u0027s still not seen as something really as important as it should be. I\u0027ve, I\u0027ve taught a class at. USC about how to run support groups for people who have been abused in groups. But it\u0027s just, they\u0027ll invite you with just that Katherine: extra awareness of like, they\u0027re coming into this and they\u0027re instantly going to feel anxious because and just that extra layer of awareness that someone who has never had that experience would have no idea that someone would come in to that Rachel: environment.No, right. It\u0027s it is. It\u0027s a niche. And and I\u0027m [00:32:00] just I\u0027m asked when I\u0027m asked, but most of the time not because they have other things that they think are more important to teach them and maybe they are. But still, this happens. And so the there is a program out of England run by Colleagues of mine who are lovely and wonderful have had a lot of experience.It\u0027s through the University of Salford and I think you can take courses online. It\u0027s a master\u0027s in coerce coercion and coercive control. And It teaches you about what that is. I don\u0027t know to what degree it teaches you to do the counseling piece, but it is a master\u0027s in it. So you have a good framework for understanding it.And it\u0027s new few years old, and I there need to be more programs like it. But I think If people want to go to conferences, or if they want to attend like the International Cultic Studies Association conference online, where there is a section that is [00:33:00] for professionals, how you do this work, I do some lectures on it, how you also do interventions how they\u0027re different than regular interventions and, Yeah, just understanding the nuanced differences in this work is important and to understand why those things are important.So I think attending conferences, if you want to learn reading some books, I\u0027m in the process of writing one that is going to be about my counseling work. So hopefully that will be out soon. I hope. And, and. It will be a little bit more of like a how to this is what happened to this person. And this is how I thought to help them.And because that\u0027s missing out there. So, yeah, so I think this program in England and also attending workshops at This at the International Cultic Studies Association Conference, which is yearly, is a good place to start. And and then reading books, you know, from people who are professionals who are talking about how they do this [00:34:00] work.I, because again, there were so few resources I really have learned most of what I\u0027ve learned. From my clients really taking notes, like, okay, that worked better than this. And why understanding it. And, you know, we\u0027ve been a learner of the Katherine: people that you\u0027re working with. And that sounds like that\u0027s part of your story is you learned from the actual people that you were working with.And, and that can be, I think, really empowering to, I think, for someone on the client side of. This person maybe doesn\u0027t understand, but they are, they want to understand and Rachel: they want it. I mean, now I can come in feeling that I have an expertise, which is great, but I also come in with enough humility to know I don\u0027t know everything, which is a really important thing for someone who\u0027s been involved in the cult to see that someone coming in, who seems to have this position of authority is saying.I\u0027m open to you teaching me. Katherine: [00:35:00] Absolutely. Absolutely. Rachel: And I\u0027m open to being wrong. I\u0027m not an actor on you. Right. Exactly. I can know about cults, but I don\u0027t know you. And I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going to work for you. Some of this is going to be trial and error. I\u0027m not going to punish you or, you know, I\u0027m not going to stop treating you because something I provided for you turned out to not be the best thing for you.And you let me know that I\u0027ll be happy that you let me know that so we can fine tune it for you. But yeah, that dialogue does not happen. Katherine: In the cold, like, yeah, like you have something to offer here that I don\u0027t have and like having that kind of relationship when you don\u0027t know and when it isn\u0027t your expertise, but it is something that you\u0027re interested in for something for someone who is.And I, I mean, I encounter this so often just with like [00:36:00] my clients and it typically comes up even just in their first initial consultation of trying therapy and admitted and immediately realizing it\u0027s not helping and it\u0027s not the person doesn\u0027t get them and doesn\u0027t understand and then. to have to go through the process of finding someone, you know, when you\u0027re, when you\u0027re traumatized and when you\u0027re exhausted and we\u0027re just trying to figure things out, what are some guidelines that you can give to someone who is looking for a mental health professional to help them that they can maybe look for just immediately when they.Look on someone\u0027s website and questions that they can ask during the consultation to kind of help them narrow down someone who might be able to Rachel: help. Right. So first, you know, I think you and I are going to be equally reactive to going onto people\u0027s websites who seemed who, [00:37:00] who are trying to come across.Like they have the answer. They are the one. And they need to be talking all about their credentials and how they can provide something that no one else can. That is a huge red flag because they\u0027re never also typically going to be able to admit that they were wrong because they know it all. So if it feels collaborative, collaborative.Like we will work together to help you get to where you want to go that kind of language. Like, I\u0027m going to hold your hand while we kind of muddle through this together. I can offer what I know, but this is something that, you know, I\u0027m not going to be coming in and I\u0027m going to be the expert and you have to listen to everything I say.And so, yes, if it has that kind of we\u0027re working together language. And that I\u0027m open to hearing, and I want to understand you so that I can help you. That is, it\u0027s nice that you get to be, as the former member or the person who\u0027s been through this, you get to be the expert in [00:38:00] that space too, because you know your story.And you know what you feel, you intuit that you need, and you want a therapist to be open to that. It\u0027s also important for people to notice when they first start going to a therapist, if they get the sense that they have to make a commitment for a certain amount of time. That is something I think people should not necessarily agree to cause then you\u0027re locked in and then if you decide that it really isn\u0027t working for you, you might feel like you have to keep coming back because you\u0027re of that mindset of you made a commitment and you have to stick with your commitments, but it only matters if it\u0027s helping you.And so you want it to be open ended. you want to be careful to, to not work with a therapist who keeps changing the subject. Like if you really want to talk about your cult experience or the manipulation that you went through or something that\u0027s specific to your experience and the therapist just isn\u0027t trained [00:39:00] in that.And instead of saying, you know what, you have a book that would be good, or maybe I\u0027ll do some research or cause I have. Katherine: Right. Rachel: And I\u0027ve had therapists contact me and say, listen, I\u0027m not telling you, I want you to meet with my client. We have a good relationship, but I don\u0027t know about this. Can you guide me on this?And can you give me some resources? I really value that. I think that\u0027s really wonderful. So if the therapist is open to learning so that they don\u0027t keep just kind of ignoring when you bring it up, cause it\u0027s not their expertise and saying, well, now let\u0027s just talk about your mother. Or whatever, like the usual suspect.No. And you want a therapist who honors your boundaries. And if you have a therapist who asks you questions and you don\u0027t know if you want to share so much information about yourself, even though in the cult you\u0027ve been trained to share everything with anyone at all times, because you have to If a therapist says, actually, that\u0027s, I\u0027m, I\u0027m kind of glad that you\u0027re saying [00:40:00] no, because you don\u0027t really know me yet and you don\u0027t feel comfortable talking and you don\u0027t know how I\u0027m going to respond to your information.That\u0027s good, then that\u0027s safe. And so what can I do, I\u0027ll ask my clients is what can I do to provide a feeling of safety here for you to let you know that I\u0027m going to handle what you tell me. In a healthy way and something that would feel safe for you. There are therapists and I\u0027ve told people this. If you have a therapist who tells you, who uses either of these two words, which are like nails going down a chalkboard for me, resistance and withholding.Katherine: If they tell you that Rachel: you are resisting or you\u0027re being resistant to this process or you\u0027re withholding information from them. Right. Just because you\u0027re saying, yeah, I don\u0027t know if I feel like force. Yes. Yes. Katherine: And it also indicates that they\u0027re almost taking offense. that the client doesn\u0027t trust them.And someone who is aware of this experience will know it is going [00:41:00] to take a lot for this client to trust me. So I\u0027m not going to force them and I\u0027m not going to push them. I\u0027m going to let them lead. And how much they want to share and even just say that, Ooh, I felt my internal haunches. Yes. Wow. Rachel: Right. And you, and that somehow the client also was told they need to make a commitment to this work. That this work is the thing that\u0027s going to change them. But that is just filled with too much ego and too much stress. And just let the person be and let them breathe and let them bring snacks.Just let them relax. Right. Katherine: . Maybe don\u0027t sip a glass of wine, but having a cup of tea is fine. Exactly. Yeah. I remember one one thing that I think my therapist said that felt me helps me feel really safe was I had mentioned sexual abuse pretty early on in our, our therapeutic relationship together.[00:42:00] And it was probably a good year before I was like talking about something else. And she was like a while back, you mentioned the sexual abuse. There\u0027s a chance that that has some you know, impact on what\u0027s happening here. Like, would you mind sharing about that a little more? And so I did. And then at the end of the session, she said, Do you want to bring this up again, like if it feels important to you or do you want me to ask you about it?Like, would you prefer to bring it up or would you prefer for me to ask you about it? And that just felt, I just felt very empowered with that. And just like, she was like, I\u0027m gonna, I\u0027m gonna leave this in your hands. If you want to bring it up again and you want to talk about it, we will. If you. Want me to ask you about it?I can do that as well. And it just felt, you know, just very, it felt very empowering and it, and it definitely created a sense of safety for me. And I\u0027ve [00:43:00] definitely like implemented that in, in with my own clients too. Just like, is this, is this something that you want to talk about more or do you want to just wait and bring it up?Later when you\u0027re ready and you just giving, yeah, just empowering the client and when they have been so disempowered and teaching them little ways that you\u0027re allowed to take this back, you\u0027re allowed to take this voice back. That\u0027s great. That is great. I, yeah. Is there anything else that you want to share about what a client might need or what a mental health first step?Professional might need in. Rachel: In this process, so starting with mental health professionals, there are going to be times like I\u0027ve, I\u0027ve gotten to a certain degree desensitized to hearing some pretty horrific stories. I was not at the beginning, of course, but it is good if you find that. You know, you want to be open to this [00:44:00] population.Sometimes they\u0027ve been through really horrendous, horrendous things. And so it\u0027s good. It\u0027s important for you to take care of you. And if this really is too much for you, or if it\u0027s too triggering, cause you went through something similar, get more support for yourself. So that you can be able, right. Or you can choose if there are certain parts of this population you don\u0027t want to work with, that wouldn\u0027t be healthy for you.And it\u0027s okay to say that. It\u0027s okay to know that. And then it\u0027s good for you to have a resource list, because I never liked saying no to a client when I didn\u0027t have someone else to offer them, you know, like, how about try this person. And so then if you know that you\u0027re starting out and you\u0027re still very much affected by the things that you\u0027re being told.It is good to have at least three or four other names to refer people to for those cases and really, you know, again, you know, really make sure that you feel protected along the way until you get [00:45:00] maybe a little more able or desensitized. For clients. I think it\u0027s really good to know that, at least the way I talk about it that.They\u0027re the ones having the power in that space, and they might not know it, but I will let people know that like I make sure it\u0027s where it might. I\u0027m not at all I don\u0027t have OCD traits sometimes I wish I had more of them in my house would be cleaner. But Right. But, I measure the furniture in my office, which is a weird thing. That might sound weird, but I make sure that my therapy chair isn\u0027t higher than the other chairs or the couch. Like I want us literally to be seeing eye to eye that we are equals here. And not lording over them just because I\u0027m in my chair, you know, I don\u0027t have power.I will tell clients that I\u0027m going to provide for them. My 31, 32 years of experience, but that they\u0027re hiring me, they\u0027re in charge. If I\u0027m not giving them what they want, [00:46:00] they don\u0027t have to stay. It\u0027s like if you take your car to a mechanic and they don\u0027t fix the problem, go somewhere else. Or say, this is actually not what I\u0027m needing.I\u0027m needing more of this. Like, guide me to know what you would like, and then maybe I can provide that with more clarity, and we can work on defining what might be helpful here. But really, you can call the shots. And you can, you know, you can cancel your next appointment and that\u0027s okay, if you have stuff to do you can, I think it\u0027s also important when someone has been involved in a cult, sometimes they get very attached to the next person who is guiding them and leading them and they can get dependent.And it is my job, I think, to be a transitional object. And it\u0027s fine if people want to be dependent on me for a time, but I will say at some point, even though I know you\u0027re calling me to ask me what decision you should make about something, I would love it [00:47:00] if you, if we could work together where you will feel confident being the one where you can ask yourself that question and feel good about the answer you give yourself and trust it.So I can be that person for a while. But part of the goal here will be to hand the baton back to you, you know, I think it\u0027s an important message. Katherine: Absolutely. Yeah. And not just. I think that that for someone looking for a mental health professional that they can work with to, as you mentioned that collaboration and that mutuality and, and, and someone not showing up in that space and like I am the expert I know.This is what you need, et cetera, et cetera. That that\u0027s a good distinction to make. And, and you can typically sense that a little bit in that first meeting and that first consultation. Not always, but I feel like that\u0027s [00:48:00] something that that will come up. And. Yeah, and I also feel like it\u0027s, it\u0027s totally fine to ask a mental health professional in that initial consultation what are some books that you have read about this?What is, what is training that you have had on this? When you say that you\u0027re trauma informed. What does that mean exactly? Have you had training in that or is it just, you know what trauma is, you know, like, like having that you can ask those questions right out of the gate and and that\u0027s okay.And a good mental health professional is not going to get defensive. Rachel: Right. Even if people want to take a break, like I\u0027ll say sure. I mean, of course I don\u0027t even have to give them permission. They can take a break whenever they want, but if they want to see if they are able to take what they got from therapy and kind of just Use it on their own and, [00:49:00] and feel like they\u0027re able to call the shots in their life and see what they can do by themselves.I think it\u0027s really important to have people have that time. And then there\u0027s no shame in calling me and saying, well, something came up. And I realized I\u0027m not equipped for that thing that just came up yet. So can I come back for a while? And yeah, I mean, you know where to reach me, you know, you have my number if you need to come back, great.But, and then when you\u0027re done with that, feel free to, you know, I also, I don\u0027t mind collaborating with other professionals. So if someone does EMDR, and I think that would be really good for. Client, then I\u0027ll, I will refer them or say, sure, they can go see someone else. The only time that becomes an issue is if someone else is seeing someone who I think is fraudulent in some way, like they\u0027re consulting with their psychic, you know, who\u0027s telling them that they don\u0027t need counseling.They just need to pay the psychic 10, 000 and they will free them of their negative energy. Okay. Then we\u0027re going to have a discussion [00:50:00] about that. But if it\u0027s someone healthy. Who is an adjunct. I think part of the wisdom that we have in this world is knowing who our resources are and utilizing them.And so I\u0027m, I never feel in competition, but I will warn someone if I think they\u0027re getting advice from someone who is taking advantage of them. Katherine: Absolutely. Well, this has been amazing. And I know that. Both mental health professionals and folks looking for one are going to find this episode very, very helpful.If folks want to know more about you and the work that you do, where is the best place to find you? Rachel: Right. So you can listen to my podcast. It comes out each week. It\u0027s called indoctrination. It\u0027s on every platform, as far as I can tell, which is lovely. And I can be reached. All my information is on my website, Rachel Bernstein therapy.com. I\u0027m Los Angeles based, but I work with people all over the world. And I have this support group. That\u0027s every other Wednesday [00:51:00] night on zoom. And I work with families with people who are trying to reach out to loved ones. Trying to plan a way to intervene if they feel they need to do that and doing just general counseling day to day in my office in Los Angeles but mostly still on Zoom.And so, yeah, there are a lot of places to reach me and I\u0027m excited to have people reach out if they think it would be helpful. Is Katherine: your support group just kind of anyone can join at any time or do you have like Is it for like a certain amount of time and you Rachel: just right. Yeah, that\u0027s a great question.So it\u0027s open ended. But I just need to vet the person before because we have had issues with people just jumping on who were from a particular group and they were. spying basically on the group to see if former members of that group were coming to this and wanting to get their information. So I, as a safeguard talk to everyone [00:52:00] first to vet them before I give them the zoom link.And and then I do have right of refusal, like if someone was pretending to be someone turns out that they\u0027re not and they really are there to wreak havoc, they\u0027re no longer invited back, it needs to remain a safe place. And it really has, except for Scientology at the beginning. And that\u0027s why I have that.I have to have that interview process now because of them. But it\u0027s been great and it\u0027s been safe and it\u0027s a really nice feeling, nice kind of supportive, collaborative feeling in that group. But yeah, so people can join at any time. And it, people come when they come. It\u0027s very open ended and which I think people.Value that there isn\u0027t the expectation and I\u0027m not going to contact them. Like what was wrong? How come you didn\u0027t Katherine: come? Yeah, that\u0027s great. And then one final thing you mentioned a [00:53:00] university that has a master\u0027s degree about coercive control I\u0027d love to Drop that in the show notes as well. What was Rachel: the university?University of Salford. It\u0027s in England. And It\u0027s S A L F O R D. They have a program in coercive control. Katherine: Alright, I will look that up and I will make sure that makes it in the show notes. Thank you so much for Rachel: being here. Yes, thank you. Thanks for interviewing me. It was lovely to talk to you.",

      "description": "Brian Lee shares his personal story of experiencing spiritual abuse and what led him to start Broken to Beloved, an online summit and support resource for survivors. Register for the Broke to Beloved Summit January 23-26, 2024 HEREBrian Lee is a pastor, coach, and speaker. As a survivor of spiritual abuse and religious trauma, he has spent his time since leaving vocational ministry in 2021 working to provide recovery and resources for fellow victims and survivors. In 2023, he created and founded Broken to Beloved, a nonprofit organization that exists to help other victims and survivors through its Annual Summit and seasonal Cohorts, while also providing trauma awareness and safeguarding practices to pastors, leaders and churches.Based in Richmond, VA, Brian loves to go on outdoor adventures with his family, explore their neighborhood, community, and city, find good parks, enjoy good food, and have fun together. As a coffee snob and addict, he could always use another cup. Transcript (Transcript is unedited for typos or misspellings): Katherine: hey, Brian. Brian: Hey, Katherine. How\u0027s it going? Going? All right. How about you? Doing, Katherine: doing well, doing, doing okay for doing okay. Or a Tuesday. Brian: It\u0027s just for the end of the month slash year slash the world is losing its mind. Katherine: Right. I know like there\u0027s been a lot of moments this week where somebody will say something about Christmas and I\u0027m like, Oh, that\u0027s, that\u0027s on Sunday.Yes. Okay. We are, we are still, there is still Christmas. Yes. Well, thanks for joining me. I am really excited to talk to you about your summit that you are hosting and curating in January for Spiritual Abuse Awareness Month. At the time this episode comes out, it will already be January. So I\u0027m really excited to hear about that.I got to participate in that [00:01:00] last year. We\u0027ll be participating again this year. Great time to just connect with other people working in this spiritual abuse, recovery, religious trauma, recovery space, and also. Spiritual Abuse Awareness Month for folks who are not aware is in January. And we were talking before we started recording about when we first heard about Spiritual Abuse Awareness Month.When, when was it for listeners that you first Brian: heard about it? I just learned about it last year because, and I, but to be fair, I\u0027ve only been doing this work for about a year now. I wish I knew about it sooner. And I think we were both saying it\u0027s like, we can\u0027t find who originated this thing. But it\u0027s been around for at least 20 years, which to me is crazy.Yeah. I learned about it because of Aaron hung, who\u0027s an artist who was doing that whole AZ trauma recovery series on her Instagram page. And I was like, spiritually, it\u0027d be some awareness a month. That\u0027s a thing. And then the more I dove into it, I was like, Oh my gosh, this is absolutely a thing. And it\u0027s been around a long time.Why do we not know more about it? Katherine: Exactly. I was wondering too, when, [00:02:00] when did that book, the oldest probably. Documented writing about spiritual abuse is probably the subtle power of spiritual abuse. I Brian: think that\u0027s what I was thinking. Yep. And that was, I think it was written in the 90s. I want to say, okay, I\u0027m going to look for a publication date because I want to be sure.But I remember reading it thinking I was like, did they just write this like a year ago? And it\u0027s like, no, it\u0027s been around for a very long time. Yeah, Katherine: yeah, yeah. And then even just like the reality that PTSD. Was not an official diagnosis until the 80s. Brian: Yes. Katherine: Yes. We\u0027re very new in this trauma world. Yes.We\u0027re all very new to this. This is a new, new territory for all of us. Did you, did you find the Brian: date? Amazon says the publication date is 2005, but that seems late to me. I feel like it was before that. It has a very nice Katherine: cover. Brian: It does! Which is why I feel like it is. So now I\u0027m opening my Kindle to look for the actual copyright date on the inside of it.Yeah, Katherine: maybe that was the most [00:03:00] recent Brian: publication. That\u0027s what I\u0027m wondering. Library, look for the yellow book right there. The yellow book. Yeah. That\u0027s what I call it. The yellow book. Copyright page. 1991. You were right. Boom. Boom. First time. Katherine: First time. Yeah. So I guess that\u0027s the first time that that became something Brian: that.People and for reference to me that feels like 10 years ago, but it\u0027s 32 years ago.Yes, I know that tells you how old I am feel like that long ago, but because it wasn\u0027t it wasn\u0027t Katherine: Yeah, I know because i\u0027m like i\u0027ve lived Yeah, I\u0027ve lived longer in the 2000s than I lived in the, in the, in the, in the 1900s, 1900s or so. Brian: It\u0027s been a while. How dare you? Yes, we are, we are, we\u0027re getting, we\u0027re getting up there.We\u0027re getting up there. Yes, yes we are. [00:04:00] Speaking of Katherine: age, actually I have nothing. Nothing to say about it. I\u0027m just trying to segue talking about broken to beloved, which is your summit that\u0027s coming up and to get us started. I would love to hear whatever you feel comfortable sharing about your spiritual abuse story and how can you, you said that you discovered this word, right?Or this phrase, spiritual abuse, this term fairly recently, when did you, maybe just to start out, when did you first hear the term and did you have an aha moment like many of us Brian: do? Gosh, when did I first hear the term? I honestly don\u0027t even know, but it was probably from one of the books that I started reading that validated that experience for me.It might have been K. J. Ramsey\u0027s book The Lord is My Courage, and I read it more as a, oh, maybe this will help me in a [00:05:00] dark season, and that\u0027s one of my favorite psalms anyway, so, and then I didn\u0027t realize she was going to go into their whole spiritual abuse story, and then I am a person who reads all the footnotes and then goes and finds all the primary resources and reads those, so Katherine: that\u0027s favorite reader.They were like, we put this in here for you. Brian: Yes. Well, and that\u0027s, I love footnotes. So, so because of her, I think is, is how I found the subtle power of spiritual abuse. And then from there, I went down the rabbit hole. I mean, something\u0027s not right. Redeeming Power, Church Called Tove, Try Softer, Narcissism Comes to Church, you know, all these books.And now in the last two years, I\u0027ve read over 40. Five books on that topic, which seems overwhelming because it kind of is, but it all came out of my personal experience, right? So I left my last church in July of 2021. I had been there for just about three years, I think. And I walked into that church.[00:06:00] My wife and I have both moved here saying to each other it would be really nice if this works out And if it doesn\u0027t because we\u0027ve already been hurt before I think we\u0027re done with ministry for a while Which feels kind of crazy to walk into a church saying that like this is the last stop Yes.Basically. Yeah. Not indefinitely, not forever, but for a while, we\u0027re going to just give this a break because we\u0027re done. And so, you know, my story goes back over 10 years now, I think I worked at a Christian college as the marketing, as the graphic designer for the marketing department. I had also attended and graduated from that college, which isn\u0027t unusual.But it was a completely different experience being a student there than it was being on staff there. And I didn\u0027t know what to do with the cognitive dissonance of looking at leaders that I respected and admired Who seemed to preach the gospel and talk about servant leadership and humility and all these things But then I would be sitting in meetings I was like I don\u0027t know who this person is who is so [00:07:00] angry and belittling and demeaning and authoritarian and all these pieces And so finally leaving that environment I need to ask you a Katherine: question, just like following up on that, because I feel like that\u0027s such a common theme of like the, what you preach and what you teach is not who you are.And I just, I just hear that all the time. And just was talking to someone about the other day about her father, who was a pastor and he. He was a pastor and he would preach these things about like parenting and then he would like not be that type of parent. And I\u0027m just curious from the experience that you had what, what is your take on that of like, why, like, you obviously know what\u0027s right.Where, where is this disconnect happening because you can preach it enough to convince people then what\u0027s happening here. What\u0027s your Brian: [00:08:00] take on that? My take for the last two or three years now has been, it all boils down to the need for power and control. And this message is going to work and this message is going to work.And so the secondary or maybe even tertiary word that comes out of that is optics. It all comes down to optics and the way things look and appear so that I can maintain power and control. And so if I can maintain this image of, then I will continue to have power and control and influence over these people as long as they don\u0027t see behind the curtain.And if they do see behind the curtain, it doesn\u0027t matter because I control them anyway because I\u0027m their boss, right? Or because I am their spiritual authority or leader or whatever it is. So I, it\u0027s wrecking. Man, there\u0027s so many ways I can go so the last pastor I had would often say things like when I first started.It\u0027s like you have to recognize the hats that you wear when you walk into a room. So I know that I\u0027m the [00:09:00] pastor. So I know that there\u0027s a power dynamic. So I had to be aware that when I\u0027m leading a conversation or that there\u0027s going to be a shift in something somewhere. But then this is the same guy who would absolutely manipulate that power dynamic.Yeah, or pretend that he was the servant or the victim or the low man on the totem pole is like you don\u0027t get it both ways. Like so. So I know that you cognitively know these things to be true. And yet I see you do the polar opposite. And then use those things to twist them to your advantage. Yes. In the way of whether ignorantly or intentionally, both are worse, harming someone else in the process.Katherine: Yeah, and that is the crux of spiritual abuse and why it is devastating and so damaging and so complex and so confusing is like these people are preaching these good messages that they are aware are quote unquote good messages, but [00:10:00] using that intentionally to manipulate and control people. So then these good messages.suddenly become infused with this thing that makes us just terrified. Brian: Poison. It\u0027s poison. Katherine: Yeah. And we\u0027re just, we\u0027re just like, I can\u0027t even engage with this, even though some of this stuff is really good, you know, that. Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and yet it just causes this. Massive cavern of, of just fear and doubt and trauma.Brian: Yes, I think that\u0027s where a lot of the confusion comes from, too, is because, because so much of it is truth, right? Or is based on quote, good intentions or scripture or whatever it is, but then you see it manipulated and twisted. So now you don\u0027t know what to believe or what\u0027s true or good anymore.Right, and you can\u0027t Katherine: trust good people who are saying absolutely, it\u0027s like absolutely walk into a room and you\u0027re like, are they good or [00:11:00] not, you know, just, just being able to trust, even just what people say and like, and then you\u0027re kind of in evangelicalism and church culture, you like you walk into a church and and everyone\u0027s believing the same thing.Well, Are, are they, are they, are we, are we all on the same page here? I talked to someone the other day that like teaches their children just because someone is a pastor doesn\u0027t mean they\u0027re interpreting scripture actually accurately. And I was like, okay, that\u0027s a very wise thing to teach your child, but so sad that you\u0027re saying.has led you to teach that to your child. Brian: Yeah. Yeah. Same. Well, and I\u0027ve heard, I\u0027ve heard parents and other people just like, because normally we instruct our kids to pay attention or listen to the grownups. And I\u0027ve heard other grown up, other adults and friends say, it\u0027s like, actually, that\u0027s not always true because grownups won\u0027t always tell you the right thing to do, or they might be wanting to hurt you in some kind of way.And it\u0027s like, I hate that we have to teach our kids that, but it\u0027s, that\u0027s [00:12:00] the way of the world today. And it\u0027s just really unfortunate and sad and grieving. Katherine: Yes. When you\u0027re allowed to be afraid of Santa Claus. Yes. Brian: Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Yes. That\u0027s okay if you\u0027re afraid. So trust your gut on that one.Yeah. So anyway, so I went through that experience three times in three different environments. Three times. The first time, not necessarily in a row, but very close. So the first time at a college with an older leader, mentor, figure, admired. Second time with a, someone who very young and then I had a short break for about two years and then ended up where I was now with someone who\u0027s basically my contemporary.But it\u0027s just getting it, getting hit from all sides of it. And I had had enough. So when we left, when I left the church in July of 21, I was like, I am absolutely done for a while and I\u0027ve got to figure all of this out because I don\u0027t know why it keeps happening to me, you know, a result of all the gas lighting is like, it must be my fault.So it must be something wrong in the denominator. [00:13:00] Exactly. And we had already been seeing our counselor therapist for a while. So we just kind of dove into the topic head first. It\u0027s like, I just, I\u0027m in a tailspin. I don\u0027t know what to do. Like, I don\u0027t know which way is up right now, and I just help. Just help.And she, she is a trauma informed therapist, which was extreme. I\u0027m grateful for, because that\u0027s not why we started going to her. But that helped to process all of this stuff and then finding these books and finding these resources and chasing the rabbit holes got me to the place was like, okay, I can name spiritual abuse.I can define it. I can name trauma and define it. And after about a year and a half. Of doing that work and processing through the trauma and the abuse. I was like, I think I might be in a place where I feel like I\u0027m doing better and I\u0027m not doing great, but I\u0027m definitely better than I was. And I think I actually have a framework for how I want to help other people because everywhere around me, I see people dealing with the same thing.And I hate that we\u0027re all here. Katherine: [00:14:00] Absolutely. Did you have, when you were like doing research, did you have something that you, how are you defining it at the time? You just calling it church hurt. What were you Googling? Brian: What were the things that you? Yeah. Well, yeah. I mean, I think it starts with church hurts.That\u0027s kind of the phrase that people hear. And then once I got my brain around the term spiritual abuse, I was like, Oh, okay. And then of course everyone quotes, the body keeps a score. So I forced myself through that one. And then through that one learned, learned trauma and then found books on religious trauma and started doing that whole thing.So just coming up with definitions and just kind of collecting all these in a master Google doc for my brain and figuring it out from there. Katherine: Yeah. Yeah. And then at what point did you say? Yeah. So you said that I want to help people and help make sense of this. Where did the vision for broken to beloved come from?Cause last year was the first year, right? April, wait, I guess that\u0027s this year, right? [00:15:00] Brian: Yeah, it is. Yeah. April of this year. Yeah. 20, 23 at the time. So it didn\u0027t start as broken into beloved. It started as a six week cohort, which I call through, which is based on the children\u0027s book. Going on a bear hunt because we can\u0027t go around it.Can\u0027t go over it. You just got to go through it. Right. And that came up from a friend, Amy. I was speaking at her summit. She does an Enneagram summit and I also do Enneagram coaching, but she said, what do you want to talk about? I was like, this sounds crazy, but. Do you want to talk like, can I talk about like spiritual abuse?She goes, what? We have to do that. And so it just got all my wheels turning and then that\u0027s what kind of turned into the cohort. So I, I created a framework for a six week cohort to lead people. You know, and the story of that is like, because I over identified myself as broken for so long, I literally walked into this last church interview with the pastors and elders and said, Listen, they were like, hey, why should we hire you?And my answer was, well, actually, you [00:16:00] don\u0027t want to hire me because I\u0027m damaged goods. Let me just disqualify myself to you now because you don\u0027t want me because I\u0027m broken and I\u0027m really damaged. So you don\u0027t want me here. And so I recognize that I was wearing that as my identity. And so through KJ Ramsey\u0027s book, through all these other books that identified Wade Mullin, something\u0027s not right and all these other things, it\u0027s like, Oh, okay, so maybe I\u0027m not the problem.Yeah, maybe there\u0027s stuff broken in the system and it\u0027s not to say I\u0027m not blameless for a lot of things because I certainly am but it was Developing a framework for what does it look like to move out of my brokenness and to actually name the things that have happened to Me because we can\u0027t heal what we can\u0027t name.So naming things is really important Recognizing where I am in time and space so that I can pull myself to the present and recognize when I\u0027m safe when I\u0027m not When I\u0027m triggered or activated when I\u0027m not And then using all the polyvagal theory stuff that she includes in there. And then [00:17:00] recognizing how embodiment is so important and breath practices and mindfulness things and moving forward so that we can recognize, identify, and then embrace our belovedness as our actual identity, not our brokenness.So the cohort came first in October of 2022. It went really, really well. I did it again in January of 23, which is the beginning of the year that we\u0027re recording. And so coming out of those two cohorts, I was like, man, it seems like there\u0027s an audience for this and a need for it. And all the books that I have read have done a really great job defining terms for me.They do a good job of validating experiences and telling stories. I\u0027ve read almost nothing that offers what now? Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Like, I just don\u0027t know what to do. Like, okay, great. Thanks for sharing the information, but what do I actually do now? Cause I still feel stuck. So the whole point of the broken to beloved summit, which came from the bookends of the cohort of starting broken and ending beloved [00:18:00] was to invite all the authors that I had read and the resources that I had found online, get them in one place and just say, great.What now? What now? What now? And to make it practical, right? So the whole tagline I use for everything is finding a pathway toward healing and wholeness. When Katherine: you were describing yourself as broken when you would walk into these interviews, what did that mean to you? Was that yeah, expound on what that meant and then how is that showing up for Brian: you?I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ve ever been asked that question. I just felt broken. Like my whole brain was. I\u0027m just unsure of what to believe or what was right or wrong. I\u0027m also an Enneagram One, which is very right wrong, black white minded. I always think I have to do things the right way. So for me It was always a, well, if I was fired from this place, or if I had to leave because I was so toxic, what did I do wrong?But other people [00:19:00] loved me, and it was just this group, so maybe it was, maybe it was them, but maybe it was me, but I\u0027m not sure, and I think I\u0027m really good at my job. And people tell me I\u0027m good at my job, but the pastor just told me I\u0027m not and that he needs to replace me because the board told him so even though they\u0027ve never given me feedback in any of my reviews that anything needed to change when I\u0027ve been asking for them for years.So it\u0027s, it\u0027s all that kind of stuff that in your brain messes with you. It\u0027s also the the second place that we left, we were friends with. The pastor and his wife, we graduated together. We were alumni together. I was like, we thought we were friends. We hung out at each other\u0027s houses. And then to do something like that and to feel so stabbed in the back, really It was a, it was just kind of whiplash, right?It\u0027s like, what, what, what happened there? And so what\u0027s wrong with me and what\u0027s wrong with my relationships? Cause I thought we were okay, but apparently not because then this happens. So walking into this last interview to just say, Hey, I\u0027m damaged goods. I\u0027m broken. I mean, that\u0027s really what it was. And then I had [00:20:00] had two years at another church where I.Genuinely thrived for two years. And I was like, Oh, there\u0027s actually a different way to do things. Yeah. And I didn\u0027t realize that. And then we experienced more trauma. One of our best friends passed away tragically in a car accident. And so that threw everything into tailspin and dealing with the aftermath of that.So it was just kind of like, Hey, we\u0027re really not in a good place right now for a transition or for something to change. And yet I felt so. Bound is not the right word I\u0027m looking for, but I\u0027m going to use it by the whole idea of. If God wants to do something here, I don\u0027t want to close the door and say no.And I don\u0027t say that to over spiritualize anything or myself, but it\u0027s just the words that came out of my mouth at the time. So we just kind of kept going with the process. And I remember the first several weeks slash months of having started this job, just trying to be really vulnerable with people and honest, just like, listen, I, I don\u0027t come here pretending I\u0027m perfect in any [00:21:00] way I\u0027m really broken right now and we need help. Just so you know that, and I might have some answers or help for you, but I\u0027m coming at it from a position of brokenness and the more I do this work, the more I recognize how okay that really is.Katherine: Yeah, and it kind of sounds like as you\u0027re describing. What brokenness was to you? It sounds like trauma, but it sounds like internalized trauma of this is somehow my fault, like these outside messages and this trauma that I\u0027m experiencing is due to something. Brian: Yeah. Potentially. Well, and isn\u0027t that part of the toxic theology that a lot of churches teach is like that you are responsible for your sins and how they label everything as sin.So if something bad happened in your life, it must be your fault because you weren\u0027t holy enough. You didn\u0027t pray enough. You didn\u0027t whatever [00:22:00] enough. Right. And it\u0027s like not. Not taking into account any of the effects of abuse where the abused actually did nothing. It\u0027s like when a woman gets raped, Oh, what were you wearing?How did you contribute? What perfume do you have? It\u0027s like, come on, really? But that\u0027s where I was mentally, emotionally, all the things. Katherine: Yeah, and that thin layer of, like, you must be sinning or God is, like, sanctifying you and is allowing these happen, these things to happen to, like, grow your faith or, you know, and, like, getting to that place, naming, as you said, getting to that place where you just, you\u0027re just able to point out it and to say this was not okay, period.Like should never have happened. We should never should never have had to go through this like this was never an okay thing when you got to your church, the last church and you like was this the church that you were [00:23:00] saying I am broken and I am damaged goods. Yes. And then that Brian: obviously didn\u0027t go did not pan out.Was Katherine: that used against you Brian: was what part used against me? The fact that you were Katherine: open about your brokenness. Brian: Yes and no, I would say by the pastor. Yes, because I think in the kindest way I can say this possible, he\u0027s a master manipulator. So I think he knew us coming in and me saying those things up front and they pitched themselves very much as, oh, well, we are a healing church.We\u0027re a place where people come so they can just receive and sit back and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Right. And but then, you know, six months, two months, four months, two years later, they\u0027re saying, Oh, you\u0027re still praying for that thing. You\u0027re not healed yet. Are you not over that yet? Right? It\u0027s that kind of stuff.And so those are the major red flags that go up. It\u0027s like, maybe this is not such a great place. Katherine: Absolutely. Absolutely. So pitching themselves as a healing place and then, and then not. [00:24:00] Not so Brian: much. Yeah, maybe you used to be but not so Katherine: much today. How would you say? broken to beloved is Creating a space that you would say is just like healthier than that Like how how are you seeking to make that a healthy space for Brian: people?Mm hmm. That\u0027s a great question. Thank you I don\u0027t know cuz I\u0027m still figuring it out. One of the first words that comes to mind is honesty and trying to be honest about Whatever it is that we are feeling or naming or experiencing because one of the things I\u0027ve learned is that when we try to push away or repress any of those things, we often get ourselves in trouble because it\u0027s something is trying to be expressed there.And it doesn\u0027t mean that we. Allow rage or ranting to take place just because because there are safe places to do to do that too, but probably not within a general community, right? Within an intimate relationship, [00:25:00] maybe, but not within a an open space. So I think the honesty piece is one of them. I think the openness is another.Another word that comes to mind is kindness. I think there was an interview I did last year with David Gate, who does all that kind of typewriter poetry, which I love. And he said something that really has stuck with me ever since. And it\u0027s this idea that you can have all these progressive, or not progressive, all these fundamentalist Christians.Or conservatives or evangelicals or whatever you want to call them who go through this process of abuse and or trauma and then deconstruction and then leave the church or whatever it is, but they don\u0027t actually examine or change anything and they just switch over to progressive liberalism or progressivism or whatever it is, and they\u0027re still fundamentalists at heart.Absolutely. And I think the fundamentalist piece, the certainty that so many people carry. Doesn\u0027t make room for curiosity [00:26:00] and kindness which I think embodies a lot of what I\u0027m trying to do is to be open and curious and kind because I also see voices online who just come across as angry all the time.It\u0027s like, I get it. There\u0027s room for that. I\u0027m angry too. But, and there are times that I drive by the church and I\u0027m like, can we just burn it all down? Sure. Right. I feel all that, but it doesn\u0027t, I don\u0027t feel helped or served by it. Yeah. The Psalms, when I did an interview this morning, and the Psalms are 75 to 80 percent imprecatory and lament, so there\u0027s plenty of room for honest, raw emotion, but there\u0027s also a time and place for it, and it doesn\u0027t have to be public, and I don\u0027t, actually, here\u0027s, here\u0027s a good thing, I don\u0027t need everyone to agree with me.Because your experience is your own and you need to figure out how you\u0027re going to process it. Here\u0027s how I\u0027ve processed mine and I\u0027m not going to prescribe anything to you that you should do it this way too. But I\u0027m going to approach it with openness [00:27:00] and kindness and curiosity and hopefully safety.Yeah. Katherine: Yeah. And I think like that. Openness, kindness, curiosity can create that safety and, and, and having that space where people can come on their own journey and find their own, their own, yeah, like find their own, their own path. And, and, and that\u0027s also just sort of like, Anti the opposite of what we experienced in the church of like, only me, the person with the, you know, title can tell you what is helpful and what, what God is really saying and putting that agency back into each individual person is sweet.Not what we were taught church and we were taught not to trust ourselves in the church context. And so, yeah, I love that, that openness, openness, kindness, and curiosity. I love it. What are some of your hopes and [00:28:00] dreams for the summit?Brian: I hope that it\u0027s helpful. I hope that it feels practical for people. I hope that people walk away with a sense of, I mean, the three words I use most often are hope, healing, and wholeness. And I say that knowing that there is real harm done when others try to prescribe a timeline to your healing. That healing is not a destination, right?And I think Laura Anderson just wrote about this in her book. It\u0027s like healing is not a destination. It\u0027s not an arrival point. It\u0027s something that we are just Doing probably for the rest of our lives. So when I say that, it\u0027s not like, Hey, show up to the summit and you will be healed. Absolutely not. But I do hope it gives you really practical tools that you can walk away with and say, Oh, this thing will help me.Right. This thing will help me to take a step. And so we had 1, 200 people register last year, which blows my mind for trying something for the first time. [00:29:00] So I it would be great to have as many or more. Not because of numbers, because God knows I hate numbers because so many churches are driven by it. But the idea that people are helped.And and moved in that direction of healing and wholeness and hope, I think so many of us who go through this kind of abuse or trauma walk away feeling so isolated, broken, like you\u0027re saying, with a lack of agency or not empowered that my hope is that you walk away with a sense of hope, feeling empowered and a sense of agency to take control of something in your life because so much of it has been stripped away from you.I think those are the kinds of things I hope for. Yeah, Katherine: absolutely. And I think even just the reality that we can like walk into a space and it\u0027s, you know, 18 or whatever speakers all speaking on something similar. And so there\u0027s this awareness that like, at least all of these people have, have, have some experience with this thing.I\u0027ve gone through this or understand this and that [00:30:00] validation of like, yes, oh, people are talking about this. And people see this as something that is really important and causes a lot of pain and deserves attention, deserves an entire summit. I think that that in itself is, is So validating and so helpful.What\u0027s, what is some information about this? What can you tell us about how folks can find the summit register if they\u0027re ready for it?Brian: Sure. We do have dates. We will be January 23rd through 26th. Last year was 3 days. I learned that was too short to pack that many speakers talking about trauma and abuse. So I\u0027m spreading it out over 4 days and I\u0027m inviting less speakers. So it\u0027s not so overwhelming every day. If you go to BrokenToBeloved. org slash subscribe, you can join my mailing list, which is where I\u0027ll probably send information first. Or you can just follow me on Instagram, which are where I post when I have time to[00:31:00] at BrokenToBeloved.Okay. All Katherine: right. I\u0027ll all of this information in the show notes Brian: so folks can read it. Thank you. Katherine: And I\u0027m very excited to be there and to be a part of it, watch all of the speakers. And is there anything else that you want to share about broken to beloved the cohort. Your journey, Brian: anything? No, I, I mean, we are like you, a 501 C three.So if you\u0027re looking for someone to support or an organization, this is the work that we\u0027re trying to do. So you can just go to same broken to beloved. org and you can find all the stuff there. I\u0027m super grateful for you and your work and having stumbled across you last year. I, I love and support the stuff that you\u0027re doing as well.Grateful to have you at the summit twice now. Um, And just love doing the work with you. Katherine: Yeah, so I\u0027m glad to partner in this with you as well. Thanks so Brian: much. Thank you.",

      "description": "Celebrating Three Years of Uncertainty: 3rd Anniversary Episode(On May 30th, 2023, Seasons 1 \u0026 2 will be archived) Transcript: I\u2019m Katherine Spearing and welcome to Uncertain, an affiliate podcast of Tears of Eden, a nonprofit supporting survivors of Spiritual Abuse, if you\u2019d like to support this podcast and the work of Tears of Eden, consider giving a donation at TearsofEden.org/support. You can also support the podcast by liking, subscribing, and leaving a review.\u00A0Here now is a very short episode to acknowledge the third anniversary of Uncertain.\u00A0This isn\u2019t a journey I could have planned. No one had every done this before, as far as I knew, starting a nonprofit focused on caring for survivors of Spiritual Abuse.\u00A0Spiritual Abuse, that subtle, extremely damaging, often disbelieved form of abuse. Over three years ago, I tried to build a map by attempting to find folks who\u2019d done this work before. My journey through the mountainous terrain of phone calls and Zoom conversations with people across the glob eventually led me to the realization that, as far as I could tell at the time, no one had yet done what Tears of Eden was setting out to do.\u00A0But this journey of discovery, of exploration, still led me to some pretty amazing humans, doing amazing work. I was having insightful conversations and learning so much about spiritual abuse. If only there was a way to capture all these conversations and share them with the world?\u00A0Enter the idea for Uncertain, a podcast intended to challenge the church to do better. At first, we focused on asking the church to stop hurting people, stop putting narcissists in the pulpit, stop using christian platitudes to sideline traumatized people.\u00A0But eventually, I grew weary of speaking to the institutional church. Tears of Eden, the nonprofit of which Uncertain podcast was an affiliate, focused on supporting survivors of the institution. It was never a goal to change the institution. Some folks out there are trying, doing good work, but that isn\u2019t, and never has been, the focus of this little organization.\u00A0So, in season three of Uncertain, we made a slight shift to speaking directly to and equipping survivors, many of whom consider themselves members of the universal church, though often they\u2019ve had to leave the institution in order to start their healing journey.\u00A0That\u2019s where we are today, focused on providing a safe place for survivors to gather and unpack their stories. Uncertain podcast is the main way people end up finding Tears of Eden. This audio format is our number one ambassador for the organization. It\u2019s also our primary resource for providing education and helping folks work through their stories. Some episodes are light hearted, like the episode with comedian Kristina Hart where we discuss the awkwardness of learning how to date as an adult after growing up in purity culture. Some episodes are really difficult, like Kody Purcell\u2019s story of abuse at the hands of her youth pastor. Some episodes are highly informative, full of aha moments, like the episode with Dr. Laura Anderson on how our anger is important for our healing journey\u2014definitely not something we heard very often, if ever, in the church.\u00A0But let\u2019s rewind a little, back to the month of May three years ago. I had planned for the first episode to launch the week of Memorial Day, it was cued up and ready to go, but boy was I anxious. As I mentioned at the top of this episode, I could not have planned this journey. I was Samwise Gamgee from Lord of the Rings, taking that step that would take me the furthest away from home I\u2019d ever been. Most of my anxiety those weeks leading up to episode one stemmed from the unknown. In launching the podcast, and a few months later, the nonprofit, I was entering a world where I couldn\u2019t predict or prepare for what was coming. I didn\u2019t know how the podcast would be received. I didn\u2019t know who the first board members of the nonprofit would be. Heck, I was just learning how to podcast and I had no idea how to start a nonprofit.\u00A0When I think of how anxious I was those first few weeks, how many times I considered bailing, I remember the only thing that motivated me to take the plunge was knowing I\u2019d regret not doing it at all more than I would regret trying and then failing, though I couldn\u2019t have told you then what failure looked like.\u00A0Today, the podcast has been around for three years. 82 episodes and we\u2019re in the middle of our forth season. Over 70 artists, authors, experts, and survivors have appeared on Uncertain. It went from a show with 50 to 100 monthly listeners to a show with thousands of monthly listeners. It\u2019s a show mental health professionals seek out to learn more about religious trauma and recommend to their clients. It\u2019s a show that provides solidarity to survivors when they feel isolated and alone.\u00A0There have been a lot personal challenges associated with this work. As the team that supports the work of Uncertain and Tears of Eden slowly grows, it\u2019s obvious we ourselves are survivors of trauma. Sometimes the work is more than our bodies can handle, and we have to take time to care for our own mental health. I hope an organization supporting survivors of Trauma will always care for the survivors who keep the organization going. Thank you for your patience, compassion, and support, for the times we need to care for and nurture ourselves.\u00A0This is where I\u2019ll sign off, with a big thank you to all of the listeners who have supported this podcast. Thank you for listening, thank you for sharing, thank you for liking and subscribing. Thank you for your financial donations, big and small. Thank you for reaching out to share your stories about how the podcast has impacted you. Happy Three Year Anniversary.\u00A0",

      "description": "Transcript: I\u2019m Katherine Spearing and this is Uncertain. And this is also the trailer for season 3, coming in January 2022.But first, a quick recap: in season 1 we spent our time addressing little-discussed subjects related to the church, many of those subjects had to do with abuse, and toxic systems that make abuse possible. In season 2 we added artists to the conversation. Artists are the truth speakers, those accurately naming the present and envisioning where we could be in the future. When it comes to the church needing to do better, who better to invite into this conversation than artist? In season 3, we will continue having conversations with authors, artists, experts, and survivors, but the one twist is we are kicking off in January, which is Spiritual Abuse Awareness Month. We\u2019re organizing a social media campaign to raise awareness about Spiritual abuse, so all of our episodes in January will feature someone actively working in the Spiritual abuse education, awareness, and recovery space. We at Tears of Eden, the nonprofit of which Uncertain is the affiliate podcast, want to invite you to join us, both for the campaign to raise awareness, and also for those episodes discussing Spiritual Abuse\u2014this is a little recognized and as of yet under-researched form of abuse and we really, really hope you will join us. Please pop over to tearsofeden.org to sign up to participate in the campaign. We\u2019re really looking forward to kicking off this conversation in January so I hope you\u2019ll tune in.I\u2019m Katherine Spearing, and this is Uncertain. ",
