      "description": "Shirley Fessel is an advocate for women who have experienced religious-domestic v!olence. As a former minister\u0027s wife, she understands the challenges faced by women in these situations and the lack of support from institutional churches.\n\nAs a former minister\u0027s wife, she found herself trapped in a situation where the institutional church and the people in it failed to provide the support she needed. Determined to reclaim herself and protect her children from the horrors of @buse, Shirley decided to create a workbook that would help women in similar situations navigate the confusing tactics used against them, such as manipulation, gaslighting, and exploitation of faith concepts.\n\nThrough her own experiences, she learned the importance of leaving @buse without guilt, listening to her intuition, and not allowing others to minimize her connection to God. Shirley\u0027s work continues to support and empower women to overcome the attacks they face and honor their intuition. \n\nThis episode will be useful to anyone, but especially those who still identify as Christian and wish to understand where God is in their journey.\n\nRelevant Links: \n- Shirley Fessel\u2019s Book, Redemption from Biblical Battering, for Christian women: https://redemptionbb.com/book/ \n- Shirley Fessel\u2019s Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Fessup44/\n- Grant, (must Read the book to be considered): https://redemptionbb.com/grant/ \n- Text message service: To sign up, text the word \u0022courage\u0022 to 917-809-7311\n- Courage 365: Facebook Group - www.facebook.com/groups/courage365\n\n\n3 key takeaways for this episode\n\n1. Religious Abuse can be a complex and damaging form of domestic v!olence, often justifying @busive behaviors through religious beliefs and scripture. It is crucial for survivors to recognize the manipulation and seek support to break free from these toxic environments.\n\n2. Women in Abusive religious settings may face unique challenges in seeking help, as church authorities and religious beliefs may discourage them from seeking professional assistance. It is important for survivors to know that they have the right to seek professional help and should not be limited to only biblical counseling.\n\n3. The guest, Shirley Fessel, offers a practical resource in the form of her self-help workbook, \u0022Redemption from Biblical B@ttering,\u0022 which explores the seven levels of confusion and provides tools for women in religious domestic v!olence situations. This workbook can help survivors navigate the complexity of religious abuse and empower them to create a new life after leaving an abusive relationship.\n\n\n[00:02:58] Workbook empowers women escaping religious abuse.\n[00:09:38] Domestic abuse tied to religious beliefs and manipulation.\n[00:12:45] Religious beliefs compound fear and control, manipulating trust.\n[00:16:24] Levels of confusion, abused women, finding strength, leaving abusive relationships.\n[00:23:49] Churches funding non-affiliated organizations for control?\n[00:28:41] Detachment, charting, and redefining for abuse recovery.\n[00:33:44] \u0022Courage to be yourself, despite adversity.\u0022\n[00:36:47] Thank you for tuning in.

      "description": "Andrew Pledger @4ndrewpledger  is a survivor of a high control religious environment. Raised in the IFB (Independent Fundamental Baptist) church, he experienced trauma and internalized homophobia due to the system\u0027s teachings that being queer was demonic and needed to be prayed away. Andrew recognizes the harm caused by such religious environments, where individuals are blamed and shamed for any issues they face, while the system itself remains untouchable. He highlights the psychological and emotional abuse faced by queer individuals who may undergo conversion therapy or be subjected to self-hatred. Understanding the process of indoctrination, Andrew acknowledges the courage it takes to question and leave these systems. He calls for the dismantling of abusive systems, encouraging others to leave and reclaim their sense of self.

The importance of self-discovery and defining one\u0027s own identity: The guest, Andrew Pledger, shares his journey of questioning and ultimately rejecting the harmful teachings of his religious community. He emphasizes the importance of self-discovery and becoming independent, as well as the role of meeting and interacting with diverse individuals in breaking down stereotypes.\n\n2. The devastating effects of leaving an abusive religious environment: Leaving a high control religious environment can result in a sense of confusion, loss of identity, and a lack of community and support. It takes courage and resources to recognize and question the indoctrination within these systems, but leaving is seen as the most powerful action to take in order to protect one\u0027s mental health.\n\n3. The ongoing struggle and discrimination faced by queer individuals: Andrew discusses the internalized homophobia and religious trauma he experienced and the ongoing micro-aggressions and discrimination faced by queer individuals, including social rejection, aggressiveness, and hatefulness. The episode highlights the need for love and acceptance within families and the negative effects of conversion therapy on one\u0027s sense of self and spirituality.\n\n\n00:00:00 \u0022Courage conversation show with host Ashley Easter\u0022\n00:03:49 Leaving an oppressive religious environment requires planning and healing.\n00:11:33 Undoing internalized homophobia is a slow, self-discovery process.\n00:21:52 Struggling with trust, trauma responses, and homophobia.\n00:26:56 Queer people face family rejection, trauma, isolation.\n00:30:14 Find love, acceptance, and healing, be courageous.\n00:34:23 Powerful podcast and resources for all journeys.\n00:35:44 Connect with us on social media, website, and text messages for support.",
