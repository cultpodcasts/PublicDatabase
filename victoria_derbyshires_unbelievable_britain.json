      "description": "Katy Morgan-Davies was born into one of Britain\u2019s most secretive cults. Despite living in Brixton, one of London\u2019s busiest neighbourhoods, she was completely cut off from the outside world and controlled by a man who called himself Comrade Bala. For thirty years, she lived under his abusive control, knowing almost nothing beyond the walls of that house until her dramatic escape. Victoria Derbyshire has spent decades as one of the UK\u0027s most trusted journalists, breaking major stories and leading some of the most powerful interviews on radio and television. Now with Unbelievable Britain, she\u0027ll prove the most unbelievable stories aren\u2019t fiction\u2026 they\u2019re happening right here. Extraordinary people with stories that reveal who we really are as a nation, surprising, inspiring, and sometimes hard to believe. Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",
