We cover the verdicts, the sentences, and the downfall of the man who called himself \u0022Vanguard.\u0022 But what happens after the headlines fade? To discuss the case\u0027s complex legacy, we are joined by a special guest: Natalie, the host of the popular podcast \u0022Allison After NXIVM.\u0022 She shares her unique insights into the story, the people involved, and the long road to recovery for those who lived through it.

      "description": "Imagine thinking you signed up for a self-improvement course, only to wake up inside a secret hierarchy where starvation, blackmail, and branding were sold as empowerment. This is the story of NXIVM, the so-called leadership program that unraveled into one of the most disturbing criminal enterprises in modern history. In Part 1, we pull back the curtain on how Keith Raniere, a man who called himself \u0022Vanguard,\u0022 and his partner Nancy Salzman built a multi-million dollar empire on the promise of human potential. We explore the early days of their Executive Success Programs (ESP), the manipulative techniques used to lure in thousands of followers\u2014including celebrities and business leaders\u2014and the slow, deliberate process of indoctrination. How did a group that started with corporate retreats and PowerPoint presentations devolve into a destructive cult? We trace the origins of the abuse, the creation of a master-slave sorority, and the psychological tactics that kept its members loyal, even as the darkness closed in.

      "description": "In 2016, a string of professionals in the quiet mining town of Krugersdorp, South Africa, started disappearing after appointments with new clients. The killer was a team of believers doing the bidding of a woman who claimed to speak for God herself: Cecilia Steyn. Join us as we unpack the chilling details of the Krugersdorp Killings, a case involving a massive financial con and a manipulative cult leader. Join us as we explore how one woman was able to gain control over her followers and convince them to commit a series of shocking murders. Join us as we discuss the terrifying power of this religious manipulation and how the cult\u2019s methods were similar to the dangerous influence wielded by figures like Charles Manson. This is the story of how a twisted belief system led to an entirely preventable tragedy. Check-out bonus episodes up on Spotify and Apple podcast now!
