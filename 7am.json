      "description": "When starting out at university, it\u2019s normal to want to meet new friends and establish a community. But for some young Australians, that formative time has led them down the path of a secretive and extreme religious sect that some former members describe as exerting \u201Cmind control\u201D and taking over their lives. So, who\u2019s behind this group? And how are Australians being impacted? Today, contributor to The Saturday Paper Aleisha Orr, on the story of Nathan and what he describes as a \u201Cdoomsday cult\u201D that changed his life.
