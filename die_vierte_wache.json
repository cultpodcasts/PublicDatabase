      "description": "Brooklyn, April 23, 2017. On a Sunday morning the invited speaker enters the platform of the Kingdom hall of Jehovah\u00B4s Witnesses and gives a crystal clear biblical talk. Nothing unusual? After 15 minutes his microphone is turned off, and an elder asks him to leave the platform. What happened? \n\nThis brother is disfellowshipped since 9 years.\n\nWhen a person pointing to Jehovah\u00B4s anointed King Jesus Christ, using the Bible, gets silenced and removed like a tick \u2013\nwhat does this tell about those who consider him and the truths he speaks out as a FOREIGN body, an impurity that has to be removed? \nHow will our Lord and King Yahshua consider them?\n\nOriginal video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiNLUSFBxVU\n\nEditing: Die vierte Wache, http://www.die-vierte-wache.eu\n\nDeutsche \u00DCbersetzung: https://youtu.be/6S2GLHp2i6Q",
