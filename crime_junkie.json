      "title": "Could These 1969 Murders Be Tied to Hollywood\u2019s Most Infamous Cult?",
      "description": "In 1969, 17-year-old Marina Habe and 19-year-old Reet Jurvetson, known for decades only as Jane Doe 59, were murdered just miles apart in Los Angeles. Marina was abducted outside her home and later found stabbed. Reet, who had recently moved from Canada to L.A., was discovered stabbed over 150 times. She remained unidentified for more than 40 years.\nWhen LAPD Detective Cliff Shepard reopened Reet\u2019s case in 2003, he uncovered poorly stored evidence that ultimately led to her identification in 2015 through DNA. Despite chilling similarities between the two murders, investigators now believe Marina\u2019s and Reet\u2019s cases were separate incidents. Both remain unsolved.\n\nTheories have swirled for decades, from possible connections to the Manson Family to elusive suspects known only as \u201CJean\u201D or \u201CJohn,\u201D men linked to both Marina and Reet. Cold case detective, Cliff Richards, pitched this to us with a mission: to help surface new insights and hopefully spark new leads. Decades later, with evidence scarce and time slipping away, hope now hinges on the public to help bring answers to two unsolved tragedies.\n\nFor even more stories like this one, join the Crime Junkie Fan Club today: https://crimejunkiepodcast.com/fanclub?utm_source=youtube\u0026utm_medium=episode_description\u0026utm_campaign=signupfanclub\n\nT-Mobile 5G home internet.
