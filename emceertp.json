      "description": "Speaker : Ainur Aiesyah binti Ahmad Azam (2024542609)\nExecutive Produce : Aeyneda Zairyn Abdul Jalil\n\nTopic : Agaya Kim : The Story of the Baby Garden Cult  \n\nThe Agaya Baby story is about a shocking part of Korea\u0027s Baby Garden cult, which started in the 1980s and 1990s and still exists today. The cult is led by a middle-aged woman who convinces everyone that she is the god, the baby, and the embodiment of love, promising heaven on earth. She claims to be sinless and demands complete obedience to her rules. The \u0022Agaya Baby\u0022 case was especially tragic, with neglect and strange practices that caused serious harm. The leader is still alive, and the cult continues to operate.",
