      "description": "Finished up ISTA Level 1 with closing ceremonies and a final sharing circle where I learned my \u0022huge energy\u0022 had triggered some people - turns out doing energy work daily has effects I hadn\u0027t considered. The temple arts training brought up things I never expected, especially about how we impact each other in these spaces.\n\nThrough all the sacred spot rituals, temple nights, and group practices, I discovered something important: you can\u0027t tiptoe around trying to avoid triggering people. The biggest lesson from this ISTA workshop wasn\u0027t about sexuality or tantra - it was about owning your presence while letting others have their reactions.\n\nThese conscious sexuality trainings aren\u0027t for everyone, and that\u0027s fine. What matters is that spaces like this exist for those who want them. Met some seriously intelligent people here - doctors, engineers, therapists - all choosing to explore what most of society dismisses.\n\nIf you\u0027re curious about what happens at ISTA workshops or temple arts training, start with Episode 1. Everything that shifted over these seven days surprised me.\n\n#ISTA #ConsciousnessDevelopment #PersonalGrowth\n\n00:00 Morning logistics and flight booking concerns\n02:15 Final pod meeting reflections\n04:30 Last dance and reveal circle - feedback about triggering others\n06:45 Processing feedback about my \u0022big energy\u0022\n08:20 Meaningful interactions during final sharing\n10:15 Addressing avoidance and seeking closure\n12:30 Closing ceremony and attempted conversations\n14:45 Reflections on different types of connections made\n16:20 Thoughts on temple spaces and personal choices\n18:40 Gratitude for the whole experience\n20:15 Final thoughts on personal growth and future paths\n22:00 Closing words and goodbye to ISTA\n\n\n\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\n\nWant more?

The day wrapped with temple ceremony featuring cuddle puddles, shadow play, and different zones for expression. Not your typical tantra workshop - this is ISTA\u0027s unique approach to sacred sexuality work.\n\nIncludes: Morning meditation, group sharing dynamics, sacred spot ritual insights, temple ceremony breakdown, and final integration.

      "description": "My first temple experience at ISTA left me with mixed feelings. After matching flowers with partners and sensing disappointment on their faces, I found myself drained rather than enlightened. I\u0027d been told today would be more intense, but honestly? I was just exhausted. I showed up for the evening temple ritual, determined to participate in the \u0022gods and goddesses\u0022 ceremony. Ended up sitting in meditation pose while the guy next to me creatively dangled candles from his toes. When they kept asking \u0022are you where you need to be?\u0022 my answer was clear - I wanted to be in bed with my audiobook. Yes, I could\u0027ve stayed longer, danced, connected with others. But sometimes the most honest choice is admitting you don\u0027t have the capacity for it. Being curious about conscious sexuality is one thing - forcing connection when you\u0027re depleted is another. I\u0027m glad tomorrow\u0027s the last day. I\u0027m even happier I\u0027m leaving early on Monday. Not because I\u0027m desperate to escape, but because constant intensity needs a counterbalance. 00:00 Morning reflection on first temple night 02:15 Addressing misconceptions about sacred sexuality 04:30 Social dynamics and rejection in conscious spaces 06:45 Raw talk about temple space guidelines 08:20 Morning sharing circle conflict 10:45 Intense ritual demonstration \u0026 preparation 12:30 Nature object ritual setup 14:20 Partner work experience - honest reflections 16:40 Second temple night - choosing boundaries 19:15 Final thoughts on workshop intensity \u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726 Want more?

      "description": "Continuing this ISTA training documentation as we dive into day 4, where things get complicated with divine parent archetypes, gender exploration, and my brutally honest take on men\u0027s circles. For those researching what happens at ISTA workshops - today challenged my preconceptions about how these trainings approach gender and sexuality.\n\nThe day moved through several temple arts exercises: working with mother/father archetypes (which gets awkward when you\u0027re attracted to your scene partners), exploring divine sisterhood (yes, as a man), and a men\u0027s circle that actually surprised me. If you\u0027re wondering about ISTA boundaries work, today pushed some interesting edges around gender roles and conditioning.\n\nThis ISTA Level 1 experience continues to mirror some Tantra workshops I\u0027ve done before, but with its own specific approach. For those researching tantra workshop experiences - while there\u0027s overlap, ISTA has distinct differences in how they handle these topics.\n\nOne thing that stands out in this training: The contrast between societal conditioning (\u0022go to school, get a job, die\u0022) and exploring new ways of relating. This isn\u0027t your typical personal development workshop - it\u0027s raw, sometimes uncomfortable, and definitely not for everyone.\n\nWatch Days 1-3 first for context on this ISTA journey. As always, this is just my direct experience - neither marketing nor warning, just what actually happened.\n\n#ISTA #TantraWorkshop #ConsciousnessWork #personaldevelopment \n\n00:00 Intro \u0026 cult reflections - \u0022Hope I haven\u0027t joined another cult\u0022\n01:13 Morning meditation and manifesting breakfast with blueberries\n02:45 Wheel of Consent dating exercise \u0026 exploring non-monogamy\n04:30 Breaking down societal conditioning (\u0022go to school, get a job, die\u0022)\n05:58 Divine Parent archetypes intro - Mother/Father exercises\n07:20 Creating familial relationships (awkward with attraction)\n08:45 Divine Sisterhood exploration begins\n09:30 Women\u0027s experiences \u0026 perspectives - powerful sharing\n11:15 Emotional response to women\u0027s stories\n12:40 Men\u0027s circle critique begins\n13:55 Actual men\u0027s circle experience vs expectations\n15:20 BDSM conversation \u0026 boundaries\n16:45 Final reflections on intensity \u0026 group dynamics\n\n\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\n\nWant more?

      "description": "Continuing my ISTA training review and documentation of what actually happens at these workshops. Day 3 dives into shadow work, the Wheel of Consent practice, and ends with a self-pleasure temple night. For those researching ISTA Level 1 experiences or wondering about tantra workshop boundaries - this one gets personal.\n\nStarting with early morning OSHO No-Dimension meditation (which involves some Sufi-style spinning), we moved through shadow exploration exercises and into the Wheel of Consent - a framework for understanding giving and receiving touch. The day culminated in a temple arts ritual that I\u0027m choosing to keep private out of respect for the process and the people involved.\n\nFor those curious about the ISTA boundaries work and guidelines: There are clear rules about participant-facilitator interactions, which sparked some interesting reflections on power dynamics in these spaces. While I don\u0027t necessarily agree with all the structures, I understand why they exist.\nAs someone who\u0027s explored various consciousness practices, from plant medicine to alternative philosophy, this training offers a unique perspective on personal development - though it\u0027s definitely not for everyone. If you\u0027re researching tantra workshop experiences, remember that your journey will be unique to you.\n\nLike previous days, this is just my direct experience - neither a glowing endorsement nor a warning, just what actually happened.

So I decided to document my journey through this 7-day consciousness and boundaries workshop...Have I joined another cult? Everyone looks pretty happy on the website - So I went myself to find out what really goes on at ISTA. \n\nThis video covers my first day at the International School of Temple Arts, from arrival to the opening ceremony. I\u0027m sharing this because I know many people are curious about these trainings but might be hesitant to take the leap. Whether you\u0027re interested in conscious relating, personal development, tantra, shamanism or just wondering what ISTA is all about, I\u0027ll walk you through my experience...Which I probably should call out now, do get a little more intimate than I would normally be comfortable sharing with strangers. \n\nIf you\u0027re new to Andy Joins Cults, I explore different consciousness and personal development workshops around the world.

      "description": "I never expected my spiritual journey to Egypt would turn into... whatever this was. It started simple enough - joining this group called Star Magic to explore the ancient sites. But from the moment we stepped into the Great Pyramid, things got weird. Really weird.\n\nThe authorities weren\u0027t exactly thrilled with our \u0022alternative\u0022 activities at the temples. And while everyone else seemed to be buying into the whole Emerald Tablets revelation thing, I kept wondering if we were actually onto something real about the pyramids\u0027 true purpose, or if we were just seeing what we wanted to see.\n\nThen came that mushroom ceremony. Look, I still can\u0027t fully piece together what happened that night. All I know is it left me with more questions than answers. Was I getting closer to some hidden truth, or was I being pulled into something darker than I\u0027d bargained for?\n\nThis isn\u0027t your typical tourist trip down the Nile. This is my story of trying to separate spiritual revelation from delusion in a land where the line between ancient wisdom and modern manipulation isn\u0027t always clear.\n\n00:00:00 Intro \n00:00:14 Day 1 \n00:15:59 Day 2 \n00:46:57 Day 3 \n01:08:08 Day 4 \n01:49:35 Day 5 \n02:33:20 Day 6 \n02:41:14 After Star Magic \n\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/@andyjoinscults\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0KSE7Qxzw2USiRZw84Qhfe?si=93916bdb9628426f \n\n\uD83D\uDF57\u2207\u262D\uD83D\uDF48\u024E\u271E\u12D8!\u2D4D\u13F3 !\u0556 \u2C80 \u263E\u2D61\uD800\uDF0B\u271E",
