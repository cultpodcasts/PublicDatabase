      "description": "Continuing this ISTA training documentation as we dive into day 4, where things get complicated with divine parent archetypes, gender exploration, and my brutally honest take on men\u0027s circles. For those researching what happens at ISTA workshops - today challenged my preconceptions about how these trainings approach gender and sexuality.\n\nThe day moved through several temple arts exercises: working with mother/father archetypes (which gets awkward when you\u0027re attracted to your scene partners), exploring divine sisterhood (yes, as a man), and a men\u0027s circle that actually surprised me. If you\u0027re wondering about ISTA boundaries work, today pushed some interesting edges around gender roles and conditioning.\n\nThis ISTA Level 1 experience continues to mirror some Tantra workshops I\u0027ve done before, but with its own specific approach. For those researching tantra workshop experiences - while there\u0027s overlap, ISTA has distinct differences in how they handle these topics.\n\nOne thing that stands out in this training: The contrast between societal conditioning (\u0022go to school, get a job, die\u0022) and exploring new ways of relating. This isn\u0027t your typical personal development workshop - it\u0027s raw, sometimes uncomfortable, and definitely not for everyone.\n\nWatch Days 1-3 first for context on this ISTA journey. As always, this is just my direct experience - neither marketing nor warning, just what actually happened.\n\n#ISTA #TantraWorkshop #ConsciousnessWork #personaldevelopment \n\n00:00 Intro \u0026 cult reflections - \u0022Hope I haven\u0027t joined another cult\u0022\n01:13 Morning meditation and manifesting breakfast with blueberries\n02:45 Wheel of Consent dating exercise \u0026 exploring non-monogamy\n04:30 Breaking down societal conditioning (\u0022go to school, get a job, die\u0022)\n05:58 Divine Parent archetypes intro - Mother/Father exercises\n07:20 Creating familial relationships (awkward with attraction)\n08:45 Divine Sisterhood exploration begins\n09:30 Women\u0027s experiences \u0026 perspectives - powerful sharing\n11:15 Emotional response to women\u0027s stories\n12:40 Men\u0027s circle critique begins\n13:55 Actual men\u0027s circle experience vs expectations\n15:20 BDSM conversation \u0026 boundaries\n16:45 Final reflections on intensity \u0026 group dynamics\n\n\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\n\nWant more?

      "description": "Continuing my ISTA training review and documentation of what actually happens at these workshops. Day 3 dives into shadow work, the Wheel of Consent practice, and ends with a self-pleasure temple night. For those researching ISTA Level 1 experiences or wondering about tantra workshop boundaries - this one gets personal.\n\nStarting with early morning OSHO No-Dimension meditation (which involves some Sufi-style spinning), we moved through shadow exploration exercises and into the Wheel of Consent - a framework for understanding giving and receiving touch. The day culminated in a temple arts ritual that I\u0027m choosing to keep private out of respect for the process and the people involved.\n\nFor those curious about the ISTA boundaries work and guidelines: There are clear rules about participant-facilitator interactions, which sparked some interesting reflections on power dynamics in these spaces. While I don\u0027t necessarily agree with all the structures, I understand why they exist.\nAs someone who\u0027s explored various consciousness practices, from plant medicine to alternative philosophy, this training offers a unique perspective on personal development - though it\u0027s definitely not for everyone. If you\u0027re researching tantra workshop experiences, remember that your journey will be unique to you.\n\nLike previous days, this is just my direct experience - neither a glowing endorsement nor a warning, just what actually happened. For context, check out Days 1 and 2 first.\n\n#ISTA #TantraWorkshop #ConsciousnessWork #PersonalDevelopment\n\n\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\n\nWant more?

      "description": "Before I went to ISTA, I searched everywhere trying to find out what actually happens at these trainings. But there\u0027s almost nothing online about the real experience, besides some particularly aggrieved and scary accounts on Reddit. So I decided to document my journey through this 7-day consciousness and boundaries workshop...Have I joined another cult? Everyone looks pretty happy on the website - So I went myself to find out what really goes on at ISTA. \n\nThis video covers my first day at the International School of Temple Arts, from arrival to the opening ceremony. I\u0027m sharing this because I know many people are curious about these trainings but might be hesitant to take the leap. Whether you\u0027re interested in conscious relating, personal development, tantra, shamanism or just wondering what ISTA is all about, I\u0027ll walk you through my experience...Which I probably should call out now, do get a little more intimate than I would normally be comfortable sharing with strangers. \n\nIf you\u0027re new to Andy Joins Cults, I explore different consciousness and personal development workshops around the world.

      "description": "I never expected my spiritual journey to Egypt would turn into... whatever this was. It started simple enough - joining this group called Star Magic to explore the ancient sites. But from the moment we stepped into the Great Pyramid, things got weird. Really weird.\n\nThe authorities weren\u0027t exactly thrilled with our \u0022alternative\u0022 activities at the temples. And while everyone else seemed to be buying into the whole Emerald Tablets revelation thing, I kept wondering if we were actually onto something real about the pyramids\u0027 true purpose, or if we were just seeing what we wanted to see.\n\nThen came that mushroom ceremony. Look, I still can\u0027t fully piece together what happened that night. All I know is it left me with more questions than answers. Was I getting closer to some hidden truth, or was I being pulled into something darker than I\u0027d bargained for?\n\nThis isn\u0027t your typical tourist trip down the Nile. This is my story of trying to separate spiritual revelation from delusion in a land where the line between ancient wisdom and modern manipulation isn\u0027t always clear.\n\n00:00:00 Intro \n00:00:14 Day 1 \n00:15:59 Day 2 \n00:46:57 Day 3 \n01:08:08 Day 4 \n01:49:35 Day 5 \n02:33:20 Day 6 \n02:41:14 After Star Magic \n\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/@andyjoinscults\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0KSE7Qxzw2USiRZw84Qhfe?si=93916bdb9628426f \n\n\uD83D\uDF57\u2207\u262D\uD83D\uDF48\u024E\u271E\u12D8!\u2D4D\u13F3 !\u0556 \u2C80 \u263E\u2D61\uD800\uDF0B\u271E",
