      "description": "Please note this episode has been edited to keep some names and identifiers confidential. Having grown up in a religious cult, Cerese shares the confusion, doubts, and even self hate - especially as an adolescent - feeling betrayed by her maturing body. The prescribed norms of the church dictated her reality, severing the healthy bonds with her father. Adolescence heralded the end of them sharing their mutual love for the outdoors. Survival as an adult included a return to the outdoors and through hundreds of hikes, as her authentic self emerged. However, it took the death of both of her parents and her best friend\u2019s death by suicide for her to finally break free from the cultic grip. The episode opens with Cerese reading her writing, \u201CNaked in the Wilderness.\u201D Trigger Warning: This episode includes references to death by suicide.

      "description": "Karina reflects on how her challenging childhood created a deep yearning for connection and stability and how she and her husband sought belonging. They turned to a messianic congregation that combined Jewish traditions with Christianity. The pressure to conform grew, as the group insisted on rigid adherence to its rules and practices about child rearing - and all aspects of church life. Over time, she began to critically examine the congregation\u2019s culture of silence, where addressing personal struggles or differing views was discouraged and seen as gossip. Things came to a crisis after the church responded with harsh judgment to the needs of her family, prompting Karina\u0027s profound realization about the importance of protecting her family, embracing her true self and cultivating authenticity.

      "description": "Today we explore strategies you can use to get out of a cult or help a loved one get out. To setup the framework for our discussion, we look at numbers and definitions. The numbers are huge. Up to 10,000 cults still exist today in the United States. That number is growing. \u201CMillions of people have been affected by undue influence. Many of us have had religions chosen for us or we\u2019ve joined self-help or spiritual groups that became harmful or destructive. We have suffered from coercive control and mind manipulations while bending to narcissists. We\u2019ve given our power of decision making over to an organization and their leadership.\u201D And language matters. The way we talk about cultic abuse influences how our good intentions are received. Someone who might shy away from what Gerette calls the C-word (cult), could respond better to \u201CControlling Group,\u201D or \u201CHigh Demand Group,\u201D or \u201CSpiritual Abuse.\u201D We discuss Dr. Hassan\u2019s \u201Creality testing,\u201D and Gerette\u2019s escape after 18 years from the Center for Transformational Learning and the strategies that worked for her. We also talk about strategies we can employ when helping others who might be embroiled in a controlling group.

      "description": "The subject of today\u2019s podcast is Emotion Control. Like it or not, as human beings, we creatures tend to respond emotionally. Comfort, praise, recognition, and a sense of belonging are among our top stimuli. Our yearning for these is manna from heaven to cult leaders. They prey upon exactly this type of vulnerability. They lure us in under the veil of comfort and specialness and then set up an \u201Cus\u201D versus \u201Cthem\u201D dichotomy. While under cultic influence, Dr. Hassan was told that the Moonies were his true family, all others were false \u2013 even evil. Vaxxers versus Anti-vaxxers is a similar kind of fault line. Today we discuss the ways cult leaders disrupt the normal right brain/left brain integration necessary to make rational decisions. By sidestepping reason, cult leaders foment fear and self-doubt. We also explore phobia Indoctrination, the Christian persecution complex, and FreedomofMind.Org\u2019s itemized list of methods cult leaders use to control their followers.

      "description": "Controlling information is a critical way authoritarian leaders and cult leaders control the hearts and minds of their followers. This week we discuss how they do it and how you can take some agency regarding the information you consume. Dr. Hassan suggests that we must each do independent research, that we must ask difficult questions, and really dig beyond the cult-controlled internet algorithms to challenge our own beliefs. Gerette describes her experience within CTL, whose leaders subtly controlled information by dominating cult members\u2019 free time. She sheds some light on the difference between information control in an Everyday Cult versus that in more controlling cults. We talk about personal truths, political truths, and objective truths. And how ambiguity tolerance\u2014allowing for the possibility of another person\u2019s personal truth to coexist with one\u2019s own\u2014can open the door to a more objective reality.

      "description": "Our focus today is Behavior Control, the first methodology in the BITE model, which refers to control of Behavior, Information, Thought, and Emotion. Dr. Hassan developed BITE as a model for evaluating degrees undue influence. As functioning adults, we like to think that we are in control of our own behavior. Last week\u2019s conversation about Influence leads us to reexamine that possibility. In this episode, we discuss how we become vulnerable to behavior control, types of behavior control, and how our environment shapes our behavior. Vulnerability to influence is part of the human condition. Dr. Hassan suggests that we are susceptible to behavior control from the moment we are born. Using healthy cynicism, curiosity, and discernment, we can begin to understand exactly who or what is control of our behavior. In the end, love is stronger than mind control.

      "description": "Can understanding the nature of influence support people in cult recovery? Dr. Steve Hassan, former cult member, author, educator, and world authority on cults will be our honored guest throughout this season . His published works include: The Cult of Trump: A Leading Cult Expert Explains How the President Uses Mind Control, Combating Cult Mind Control: The Guide to Protection, Rescue and Recovery from Destructive Cults, Freedom of Mind: Helping Loved Ones Leave Controlling People, Cults, and Beliefs. Today we are going to discuss his dissertation published January 2021: \u201CThe BITE Model of Authoritarian Control: Undue Influence, Thought Reform, Brainwashing, Mind Control, Trafficking and the Law.\u201D Our focus today is the BITE model, which refers to Behavior-Information-Thought-Emotion control. Dr. Hassan developed BITE as a model for evaluating degrees undue influence. Gerette references the book Influence: Science and Practice by Robert Cialdini. Steven Hassan, PhD is a mental health professional and expert in undue influence tactics used by authoritarian leaders and destructive cults. His foundational online course is \u201CUnderstand Cults: The Basics.\u201D He is the Founding Director of the Freedom of Mind Resource Center , which provides training, consulting and support to individuals who are struggling to leave or recover from a cult and to families and organizations that are concerned about cult behaviors. He also is the founder of Freedom From Undue Influence , a not-for-profit entity with the purpose of conducting and publishing the research on undue influence that is needed to update legal and social policies. He developed the BITE Model of Authoritarian Control to identify control tactics and the Influence Continuum Model to discern ethical from unethical influence. He developed the Strategic Interactive Approach (SIA), as an effective and legal intervention alternative for families to help cult members. Dr. Hassan believes that access to the truth, freedom of thought, and freedom from undue influence are basic human rights. A complex systems approach, based in science and supported by the rule of law , is necessary to protect these rights. He is a member of the Program in Psychiatry and the Law at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center, a teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School. He is an experienced educator having served as an instructor for the Harvard Law School Trial Advocacy Workshop, as an elective teacher and a presenter for the Harvard Longwood Psychiatry Residency Training Program, and in other educational and training capacities for other higher education, professional, law enforcement, governmental, non-governmental and advocacy group audiences. Dr. Hassan began helping people affected by undue influence after he was deprogrammed from the Moon cult in 1976 at age 22. His 45 plus years of experience give him a unique perspective on the damaging effects of undue influence and exploitation by destructive cults. He is a frequently requested speaker and media interviewee . Dr. Hassan holds a Master\u2019s Degree in Counseling Psychology from Cambridge College and a Doctorate in Organizational Development and Change from Fielding Graduate University School of Leadership Studies.

Awake, cult survivors remain ever watchful for the potential for harmful power dynamics that play out in the world or in themselves. Waking Up Again and Again is the effort required to be a conscious, conscientious, human being.

This is the period of dawning recognition; it\u2019s the acknowledgement that you have been indoctrinated. It demands a huge shift in consciousness. For many, it is also an awakening of conscience when you see how you or your loved ones have been harmed by the group. It may also be a realization that you have been complicit with something that is in direct contradiction to your deepest personal values or even morality itself.

We discuss how the cult leader lulled members into this stage and the impact it had and still has on their lives. We also talk about how to recognize such a sleeper and what you can do when you think a loved one has fallen prey to the dangers of a cult. A recent New York Times article suggests that 15% of people in the US are involved in QAnon, an organization that many people consider to either be a cult or have cultic qualities.

Drifting is a period of psychological meandering where part of one\u2019s psyche is lulled into unconscious complicity with a doctrine. During this stage one can be easily influenced but can also hold down a job and raise a family without great negative impact, despite the fact that they are living a split reality. We also discuss the cult leader\u2019s lack of accountability, training, or ethical standards for the \u2018therapy\u2019 sessions he conducted, and the predatory, non-consensual relationships \u2018Doug\u2019 had with members of the \u2018Center for Transformational Learning\u2019 cult he founded.

In this introductory episode, cult survivor Gerette Buglion, author of An Everyday Cult, delves into her experience living in a cult for eighteen years to answer these compelling questions. Cult dynamics exist in all layers of society. They can be political, racist, religious, sexual, satanic, or educational. They can be founded on human potential, mass transformation, or mass marketing\u2026 Initially, many Everyday Cults can seem perfectly normal and acceptable until that very convincing fa\u00E7ade starts to crack. We discuss the techniques cults use\u2014such as \u2018love bombing\u2019, polarized thinking, and loading the language which we\u2019ll investigate further in future episodes\u2014to attract and keep members and the unbalanced power dynamics that often result.
