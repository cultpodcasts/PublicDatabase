      "description": "Is this a scam? Allegations resurfaced against \u0027Life Coach\u0027 Hun Ming Kwang? New allegations against Goh Chew Hui? What is ThisConnect.Today, Clean Your Toilet Podcast, Freedom Pathways Work, Threading Worlds books, Hunny and Lummy, Divine Mastery Retreat, Healing the Cracks, and Pinnacle Mastery Institute, all dubious brands and entities created by the same person? I\u0027ll try to give you an explanation on the potential scam of inner works, life coaching, new age frauds, and processwork, as well as some of the legal problems they are facing. I don\u0027t even talk about the rampant cultural appropriation. By the end of this video, maybe you\u0027ll say, \u0022Oh, yes, this is a scam for sure.\u0022 Maybe, I cannot legally say you will say that. \n\nWeird video description, right? Almost like Chat GPT wrote it. But it didn\u0027t. There\u0027s a reason why it\u0027s so weird. It\u0027s a very smart reason, I promise. Scammy scum scam. \n\nPatreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/aden_ng\n\nLinks to me:\nhttps://bio.link/aden_ng\n\n#innerwork #lifecoach #newage #scams #debunk #skeptic",

And in case this gets abuse struck again, the video is licensed under Creative Commons, so you all have my permission to download this and repost it elsewhere.\n\nThis video was way too big, let\u0027s be honest. I dive into the world of self-help movements, looking at individuals like Robert Kiyosaki and Hun Ming Kwang, and groups like the ICF and ThisConnect. I hope the 12 weeks of research and risk of defamation is worth it! It\u0027s probably not.
