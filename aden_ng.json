And in case this gets abuse struck again, the video is licensed under Creative Commons, so you all have my permission to download this and repost it elsewhere.\n\nThis video was way too big, let\u0027s be honest. I dive into the world of self-help movements, looking at individuals like Robert Kiyosaki and Hun Ming Kwang, and groups like the ICF and ThisConnect. I hope the 12 weeks of research and risk of defamation is worth it! It\u0027s probably not. Oh look, is that a Patreon? \n\nPatreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/aden_ng\n\nLinks to me:\nhttps://bio.link/aden_ng\n\nLinks to others:\nDan Olsen - @FoldingIdeas \nA Brief Video on Jordan Peterson - https://youtu.be/hSNWkRw53Jo?si=vmBDXCdRoJKeqVW0\nQuantum Mysticism is Stupid by Professor Dave - https://youtu.be/aQTWor_2nu4?si=j84hnsZ226iiiwHK\nMarie Howalt (VO for Michelle Goodmen) - https://www.instagram.com/mhowalt\n\n0:30 - Let\u0027s Get Started\n3:53 - Robert Kiyosaki and Hun Ming Kwang\n8:25 - ICF and Legally Protected Terms\n15:48 - Mental Health and Unqualified Therapy\n22:01 - ThisConnect Today\n28:15 - (Skip for epilepsy)\n30:37 - The Evolving Dangers of Self-Help Movements\n36:11 - The Monologue\n\n#selfhelp #guru #mentalhealth #awareness",
