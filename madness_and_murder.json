      "description": "Authors:\u00A0Samya and Mia\nDescription:\nOn November 18, 1978, a mass suicide at Jonestown changed nearly one thousand lives. Peoples Temple leader Jim Jones led over 900 members in a mass suicide through the consumption of cyanide-laced punch. We take a deep dive into the Peoples Temple timeline, and the years leading up to the mass suicide. Through the exploration of Jim Jones\u2019 leadership and members\u0027 experiences we discover the true conditions of the Peoples Temple. Additionally, we dissect the media\u2019s approach to the coverage of Jonestown from an ethical standpoint.\nSources:\nhttps://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/mass-suicide-at-jonestown.\u00A0\nhttps://www.history.com/news/jonestown-jim-jones-mass-murder-suicide.\u00A0\nFBI statement of the jonestown cult including FBI files.\nhttps://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=16973\nhttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/media/pdf/transcript/Jonestown_transcript.pdf.\nhttps://time.com/6120017/jonestown-massacre-survivors/#\u00A0\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g294078-d32714084-2_Day_Jonestown_Memorial_Tour-Georgetown_Demerara_Mahaica.html#/media/32714084/?albumid=-150\u0026type=ALL_INCLUDING_RESTRICTED\u0026category=-150\u00A0\nMusic:\n\u201CDark mysterious true crime music - loopable\u201D by Joel Fazhari - Pixabay\nhttps://pixabay.com/music/crime-scene-dark-mysterious-true-crime-music-loopable-235870/",
