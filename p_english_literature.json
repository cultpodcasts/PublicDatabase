      "description": "Annie\u0027s 6th book, PARADISE UNDONE: A NOVEL OF JONESTOWN, arrives in the world on the 45th anniversary of the Jonestown massacre after a very long journey of 20 years since germination of the idea. Hundreds of publishers rejected it, 17 contest judges placed it as a finalist, and a chance encounter with a new British publisher led to this happy occasion. \n\nHer second book, LILY IN THE DESERT: STORIES, was published by the Carnegie-Mellon University Press Series in Short Fiction in 2001. Her first book, YORK FERRY: A NOVEL (Cane Hill Press, 1993), was well reviewed in the New York Times Book Review, the Los Angeles Times and was selected as a Pick-of-the-Month by Library Journal. It was chosen by the international Rubery Award for their annual fiction prize in 2016.\n\nShe lives in South-Central Colorado, where she writes and makes art in the shadow of the Sangre de Cristo Mountain range. She also edits manuscripts online and teaches for the University College Creative Writing Master\u2019s Program\nLink: https://www.amazon.com/stores/Annie-Dawid/author/B001KCGJEI",
