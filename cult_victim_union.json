      "description": "Jaggi Vasudev (who likes to call himself Sadhguru , the true Guru) created this death trap.\n\n Excerpt from him, \u0022 There is a mercury lingam in the Theerthakund. The Rasalinga is made of solidified mercury which is 99.8% pure mercury. This is generally considered 100%. There are only 0.2 % of impurities which could not be taken out. Generally, according to the principles of modern chemistry, you cannot solidify mercury at room temperature. According to Western science, mercury can only be solidified below freezing point. Here, at normal room temperature, you see it is solidified in the linga form. This is an ancient science, an ancient Indian alchemy, through which mercury can be solidified at room temperature. And mercury is the heaviest substance on the planet. This Linga is just two feet tall, but it weighs 680 kgs. That\u0027s a lot of weight for an object of this size. The rock beneath, the avudayar, which is at least 5 or 6 times bigger than the lingam itself, probably weighs just about 150 kgs or maybe 200 kgs, not more\u0022",
