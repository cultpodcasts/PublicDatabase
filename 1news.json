Then heading, with little or no money, into a world you\u2019ve been told is damned. But sometimes you have no choice, because you\u2019ve started questioning the leaders. \nThe tight-knit, secretive Christian community has, for decades, fascinated and disturbed us. Allegations of physical, mental and emotional abuse have swirled around the church and its leaders while those who try to blow the whistle say they\u2019re shunned and broken. Gloriavale recently released an extraordinary and unexpected statement outlining their response to some of these allegations, hoping to put it behind them. This week, in a special report from John Campbell, brave survivors of Gloriavale abuse break their silence.\n\nSubscribe to 1News: http://bit.ly/1NEWSSubscribe | Join the Sunday team as they delve into the subjects that matter to you.\n\nWATCH SUNDAY 7.30PM ON TVNZ 1 OR CATCH UP ONDEMAND: https://www.tvnz.co.nz/shows/sunday/\n\nFOLLOW SUNDAY ON SOCIAL MEDIA \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SundayTVNZ/ \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/SundayTVNZ/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SundayTVNZ/\n\nFor the latest news from Aotearoa and overseas: https://1News.co.nz\n\nThis is the official channel of TVNZ\u0027s 1News, where news and current affairs reports are uploaded from 1News, Seven Sharp, Breakfast, Q\u002BA, Fair Go and Sunday.",

      "description": "When SUNDAY first met Lilia Tarawa, she\u0027d been brainwashed. Born in the isolated religious sect Gloriavale, the 16 year old had been raised to believe everyone in the outside world was destined to burn in hell. Her life was one of obedience and submission. A decade on Lilia is a sassy, young woman who embraces her body, her voice, and her freedom. She finally has a mind of her own. It\u0027s been a painful journey, facing her own demons, leaving behind the family members she loves, and finding out\u2026 who Lilia really is.",
