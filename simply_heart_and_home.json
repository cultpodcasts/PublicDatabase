      "description": "Hello.  In today\u0027s video, I will be discussing the newest TLC show - Big Family, Big City.  This \u0022reality\u0022 show features the De La Mottes family.  Amber and Marc have 11 children.  The parents say they left a \u0022cult\u0022 after a long time and now are pursuing their children\u0027s dreams.  Did they leave their cult mentality behind or did they bring it with them?  Thank you for watching. ~Gina xo\n\nThank you so much for watching.
