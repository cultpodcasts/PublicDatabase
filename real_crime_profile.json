We discuss his family dynamics and his craving for his father\u2019s approval. Instead of overcoming that lack of father love, instead of championing the strong women in his life who were raising him and sacrificing for him, instead of creating good in the world \u2014 he chose a different path, one of subjugating women, and exploiting vulnerable young men.

      "description": "In 2010, on the small woodsy campus of Sarah Lawrence College located in Yonkers, New York, 50 year old Lawrence Ray came to \u201Ccrash\u201D with his daughter Talia in her on-campus dorm town-house that she shared with several other students, ostensibly until he found a place to live after his recent release from prison. That fateful \u201Cvisit\u201D turned into a twisted decade long odyssey of abuse and coercive control that would nearly ruin the lives of several young people including Isabella Pollok, Claudia Drury, Dan Levin, Santos, Yalitza, and Felicia Rosario. Using the framework of Hulu\u2019s extraordinary docs-series \u201CStolen Youth\u201D we examine who these victims were, how they were lured into Larry\u2019s web and how he was able to torture and traumatize them for so long. It is a cautionary tale that everyone needs to learn from. This is not about a \u201CSarah Lawrence sex cult\u0022, (in fact Laura and Jim debate whether this is a cult at all)...this is about unmasking a master manipulator capable of fooling everyone he came into contact with\u2026including the FBI. #StolenYouth #HerNameisTaliaRay #HerNameisIsabellaPollok #HerNameisClaudiaDrury #HisNameisDanLevin #HisNameisSantosRosario #HerNameisYalitzaRosario #HerNameisFeliciaRosario #VictimsofCoerciveControl #SarahLawrenceCollege #Mastermanipulator #CultLeader #FBI #NewScotlandYard #CriminalProfilers #RealCrimeProfile #podcast #truecrime #ExpertAnalysis *************** SUPPORT OUR OTHER SHOWS *************** CRIME ANALYST PODCAST - You\u2019re interested in real crime?

      "description": "Laura and Jim analyze the \u201Cconfession\u201D written by Brian Laundrie about his version of events leading to, in his words, his \u201Cending\u201D Gabby Petito\u2019s life. Do they point out red flags of deception, gaps in timeline and inconsistencies in spatial relationships? You will want to listen and find out. Here is the letter in its entirety. \u201CGabby, I wish I was right at your side, I wish I could be talking to you right now. I\u2019d be going through every memory we made, getting even more excited for the future. But [we] lost our future. I can\u2019t [live] without you. I\u2019ve lost every day we [could\u2019ve] spent together, every holiday. I\u2019ll never get to play with [illegible] again. Never go hiking with TJ. I loved you more than anything. I can\u2019t bear to look at our photos, to recall great times because it is why I cannot go on. When I close my eyes, I will think of laughing on the roof of the van, falling asleep to the sight of [illegible] at the crystal geyser. I will always love you.\u201D \u201CIf you were reading Gabs\u2019 journal, looking at photos from our life together, flipping through old cards you wouldn\u2019t want to live a day without her. Knowing that everyday you\u2019ll wake up without her, you wouldn\u2019t want to wake up. I\u2019m sorry to everyone this will affect, Gabby was the love of my life, but I know [adored] by many. I\u2019m so very sorry to her family because I love them. I\u2019d [consider] her younger siblings my best of friends\u2026 I am sorry to my family, this [is] a shock to them as well a terrible grief.\u201D \u201CThey loved as much, if not more than me. A new daughter to my mother, an aunt to my nephews. Please do not make this harder for them, this [occurred] as an unexpected tragedy. Rushing back to our car trying to cross the streams of [illegible] Spread Creek before it got too dark to see, too cold. I hear a splash and a scream. I could barely see. I couldn\u2019t find her for a moment, shouted her name. I found her breathing heavily, gasping my name [illegible.] She was freezing cold. [Illegible] We had just came from the blazing hot national parks in Utah.\u201D \u201CThe temperature had dropped to freezing and she was soaking wet. I carried her as far as I could from the stream toward the car, stumbling, exhausted in shock, when my knees buckled[illegible] and knew I couldn\u2019t safely carry her. I started a fire and spooned her as close to the heat. She was so thin, had already been freezing too long. I couldn\u2019t at the time realize that I should\u2019ve started a fire first but I wanted her out of the cold back to the car. From where I started the fire I had no idea how far the car might be, only knew it was across the creek.\u201D \u201CWhen I pulled Gabby out of the water, she couldn\u2019t tell me what hurt. She had a small [bump] on her forehead that [eventually] got larger. Her feet hurt, her [wrist] hurt but she was freezing, shaking violently. While carrying her she continually made sounds of pain. Laying next to her she said little, [lapsing] between violent shakes, gasping in pain, begging for an end to her pain. She would fall asleep and I would shake her awake, fearing she shouldn\u2019t close her eyes if she had a concussion.\u201D \u201CShe would wake in pain, start her whole painful cycle again [illegible] She was furious that I was the one waking her. She wouldn\u2019t let me try to cross the creek, thought like me that the fire would go out in her sleep and she\u2019d freeze. I don\u2019t know the extend of Gabby\u2019s injuries, only that she was in extreme pain. I ended her life, I thought it was merciful, that it is what she wanted but I see now all the mistakes I made. I panicked, I was in shock. But from the moment I decided, took away her pain, I knew I couldn\u2019t go on without her.\u201D \u201CI rushed home to spend any time I had left with my family. I wanted to drive north and let James or TJ kill me but I wouldn\u2019t want them to spend time in jail over my mistake, even though I\u2019m sure they would have liked to. I am ending my life not because of a fear of punishment but rather because I can\u2019t stand to live another day without her. I\u2019ve lost our whole future together, every moment we could have [shared.] I\u2019m sorry for everyone\u2019s loss. Please do not make life harder for my family, they lost a son and a daughter. The most wonderful girl in the world. Gabby I\u2019m sorry.\u201D \u201CI have killed myself by this creek in the hopes that animals may tear me apart. That it may make some of her family happy.\u201D \u201CPlease pick up all of my things.

Using the framework of the stunning documentary streaming now on the Topic platform, \u201CThe Missing Children\u201D, Laura, Jim and Lisa analyze this case that involves multiple layers of treachery, abuse and as Laura says \u201Cevil\u201D. If 796 children went missing in your town, there would be an uproar. If year after year, 30 to 40 babies died in the care of those who were responsible for their well being your community would demand answers. So why did no one question this when it happened to these particular children. Your blood will boil when you hear the answers.\u00A0\nWe dedicate this podcast series to International Women\u0027s Day 2022 to honor all the women and children victims and survivors.

      "description": "On August 12, 2021, Gabrielle Petito and Brian Laundrie were pulled over outside of Moab, Utah. The police officer, whose body cam was on, initially stopped their van for speeding and reckless driving. He realized Gabby was distraught and tried to establish what had happened and why Gabby was so upset. He was soon joined by another officer who had been responding to a possible domestic violence call in town where a witness said he saw a couple driving away in a white van, with a woman named Gabby. What happens next on the body cam footage is disturbing to watch. Jim and Laura breakdown the behavior of Gabby, Brian and the officers in that 1 hour and 17 minute tape and discuss the police interaction and other intervention opportunities and strategies that should have been considered. What these officers desperately needed was the DASH risk assessment tool, that Laura created, so they could have asked the most important questions, and really understood Gabby\u0027s answers.
