      "title": "175: A Cult \u0026 the Murder of Doris Angleton",
      "description": "Sherry Shriner had a wacky belief: That alien lizards had come to Earth, shape shifted into human form, and were conspiring to put the antichrist in power. Sherry shared this belief online, and incredibly, her views gained traction. Soon, thousands of people came to believe the \u201Cprophet\u201D Sherry Shriner\u2019s teachings. Steven Mineo and his girlfriend Barbara Rogers were two of Sherry\u2019s loyal followers. But when Barbara made a Facebook post about steak tartare, their online community turned on them. Then Kristin tells us about the Angleton family. The Angletons had it all. They lived in an affluent area of Houston, Texas. They belonged to the best country club. They hobnobbed with all the right people. Bob Angleton worked long hours as a bookie. His hard work meant big money. But the money couldn\u2019t make up for the problems in Bob and Doris\u2019 marriage. So in February of 1997, Doris asked Bob for a divorce. Two months later, police discovered Doris Angleton dead in her home. And now for a note about our process. For each episode, Kristin reads a bunch of articles, then spits them back out in her very limited vocabulary. Brandi copies and pastes from the best sources on the web. And sometimes Wikipedia. (No shade, Wikipedia. We love you.) We owe a huge debt of gratitude to the real experts who covered these cases. In this episode, Kristin pulled from: An episode of The Dead Wives Club titled, \u201CThe Bookie\u2019s Wife\u201D \u201CThe Bookmaker\u2019s Wife,\u201D by Skip Hollandsworth for Texas Monthly An episode of Power Privilege and Justice titled, \u201CThe Murder of Doris Angleton\u201D \u201CDoris Angleton\u201D entry on Wikipedia In this episode, Brandi pulled from: \u201COnline Alien Reptiles\u201D episode Deadly Cults \u201CMan\u0027s Online Feud With Reptile-Fearing Cult Ends In Bizarre Murder\u201D by Erik Hawkins, Oxygen \u201CReptile Cult Feud Ends in Death\u201D by Kelly Weill, The Daily Beast \u201CIt looked like a simple domestic murder.
