      "description": "Last week, the New York Times reported that a former dancer with Shen Yun filed a lawsuit against the dance troupe, accusing it of trafficking children. This follows a previous NYT piece published in August in which they reported a number of former dancers accusing leaders of the troupe of physical and emotional abuse. On this episode, KJ and Amanda discuss these allegations, the right-wing beliefs of anti-China cult Falun Gong \u2014 Shen Yun\u2019s parent organization \u2014and parallels to the Moonies in South Korea.\n\nOur understanding of China \u2014 and U.S.-China relations \u2014 has become a defining feature of all global politics. The China Report is a new show produced in collaboration with Pivot to Peace where every week, journalist Amanda Yee and political analyst KJ Noh will be helping you through all the propaganda with an independent view of the country we are taught to hate, but know so little about.\n\n#breakthroughnews",
