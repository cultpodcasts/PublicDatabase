      "description": "If you want to see Kate live join us in Birmingham March 21,22\nDetails at www.feartofreedom.ca \n\nKate is a psychodynamic psychotherapist based in Kent, UK, who understands the complexities of freedom from fear stemming from her upbringing as a Jehovah\u0027s Witness. Having been raised in a high-control religion like the Watchtower, she brings a unique perspective to her practice. Trained and supervised by Dr. Gillie Jenkinson in the Walking Free Therapeutic Model, Kate is also an affiliate of Hope Valley Counselling. She works internationally with clients who have suffered from the trauma of coercive control and manipulation in cultic environments, both in one-to-one and group settings. Before her journey as a therapist, Kate contributed to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), where she helped create a variety of mental health guidelines for the NHS, particularly focusing on issues relevant to those affected by JW beliefs.",
