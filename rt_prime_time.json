The Scientologists refrain from participation in the programme as for them the issue as they see it has nothing to do with them, but is a purely private family affair.\nAnne Robinson explains that the family have had no contact with him since\nthe death of his father 12 years ago. He has totally disconnected from his family.\n\nThe Director of the Dialogue Ireland Trust* Mike Garde and Dr Patrick Randall of Forensic Psychological Services* discuss the nature of undue influence and the processes which might be involved in being \u2018invisibly mentally handcuffed,\u2019 and in \u2018the spider\u2019s web,\u2019 of these types of groups.",
