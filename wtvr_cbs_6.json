      "description": "A huge new tranche of files on millionaire financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein released Friday revealed details of his communications with the wealthy and powerful, some not long before his death by suicide in 2019. Those include communications with a Trump adviser, an ex-Obama White House official, Elon Musk and the current commerce secretary. The Justice Department disclosed more than 3 million pages of documents, as well as thousands of videos and photos, as required by a law passed by Congress. Millions of files remain under wraps, however, drawing criticism from Democrats even as a top prosecutor says more records will be released.",
