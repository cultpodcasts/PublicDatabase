      "description": "Chad Daybell\u2019s Love Letters to Tammy EXPOSED: Fiction or Reality?\n\nOn Hidden Killers Live, Tony Brueski and the crew unpack Letter Two from Chad Daybell\u2019s prison writings, where he devotes the entire entry to Tammy Daybell \u2014 the wife he was later convicted of conspiring to kill.\n\nChad paints a glowing portrait of their early romance, marriage, and family life. He gushes over their first meeting, the Oingo Boingo and B-52s concerts they attended, and the book company they built together. He describes Tammy as vibrant, kind, and angelic \u2014 almost saintlike in his retelling.\n\nBut the irony is suffocating: this is the same man convicted of orchestrating Tammy\u2019s murder, burying children in his backyard, and plotting alongside Lori Vallow in one of the most infamous cult-driven cases in American true crime.\n\nThe hosts break down the surreal contradictions. How does a man convicted of family annihilation manage to write love letters that sound like Hallmark scripts? How does nostalgia about \u201Cfamily dance parties\u201D ring when you know what he really did?\n\nWith sharp banter and biting analysis, this segment reveals the psychological gymnastics of a killer desperate to rewrite his own history. It\u2019s unsettling, absurd, and a darkly fascinating glimpse into how Chad Daybell sees himself \u2014 and how far he\u2019ll go to manipulate even from death row.\n\n#ChadDaybell #TammyDaybell #LoriVallow #DaybellTrial #CultCrimes #HiddenKillers #TrueCrimeObsessed #PodcastClips #CourtCase #FamilyMurder\n\nWant to comment and watch this podcast as a video? \n\nCheck out our YouTube Channel. https://www.youtube.com/@hiddenkillerspod\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/hiddenkillerspod/\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/hiddenkillerspod/\nTik-Tok https://www.tiktok.com/@hiddenkillerspod\nX Twitter https://x.com/tonybpod\n\nListen Ad-Free On Apple Podcasts Here: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/true-crime-today-premium-plus-ad-free-advance-episode/id1705422872",

      "description": "INSANE Confession: Amish Mom Claims Husband Is \u201CIn a Fish\u201D After Drowning at Ohio Lake \n\nIt sounds like something ripped straight from a dark biblical parable \u2014 but it\u2019s real. At a quiet Ohio lake, what should have been a simple Amish family camping trip turned into one of the most shocking true crime stories of the year. By the end of the day, Marcus Miller was dead, 4-year-old Vincent was drowned, and his mother Ruth Miller was calmly telling police on bodycam that her husband was \u201Cat the bottom of the lake in a fish.\u201D\n\nIn this Hidden Killers Live segment, Tony Brueski, Stacy Cole, and Todd Michaels break down the timeline of August 23rd at Atwood Lake. What started as a \u201Ctest from God\u201D spiraled into horror: Marcus walking into the water and never returning, Ruth \u201Cgiving\u201D her son to God, and her desperate claim to officers that her husband had been swallowed whole like a modern-day Jonah.\n\nThe hosts dig deep into the questions this case forces us to ask: Was Ruth Miller insane, or was this faith taken to its most destructive extreme? How does a community with limited access to mental health care handle delusions that masquerade as religious devotion? And how can a family\u2019s private spiral turn into a public tragedy that shocks the entire country?\n\nWith bodycam footage capturing Ruth\u2019s chilling calmness, this case exposes the razor-thin line between devotion and delusion, faith and psychosis. Is this simply madness \u2014 or a warning about what happens when insular belief systems collide with untreated mental illness?\n\n#RuthMiller #Amish #TrueCrime #HiddenKillers #AtwoodLake #InsanityDefense #OhioCrime #Bodycam #ReligiousDelusion #FaithAndCrime\n\nWant to comment and watch this podcast as a video?\n\nCheck out our YouTube Channel. https://www.youtube.com/@hiddenkillerspod\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/hiddenkillerspod/\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/hiddenkillerspod/\nTik-Tok https://www.tiktok.com/@hiddenkillerspod\nX Twitter https://x.com/tonybpod\n\nListen Ad-Free On Apple Podcasts Here: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/true-crime-today-premium-plus-ad-free-advance-episode/id1705422872",

      "description": "\u200BConvicted killer Chad Daybell \u2014 sentenced to death for murdering his wife Tammy Daybell and Lori Vallow\u2019s children, Tylee and J.J. \u2014 has released another surreal letter from prison. This time, he rewinds to his days as a young LDS missionary in New Jersey, recounting street confrontations, spiritual visions, and even a moment when Whitney Houston\u2019s \u201CSo Emotional\u201D became, in his words, a \u201Csacred hymn.\u201D\n\nDaybell also uses the letter to lament his excommunication from the LDS Church, portraying himself as the victim of a cold and unfair process, and insisting he is still spiritually intact despite being cast out. Throughout, he frames himself as a devoted man of faith \u2014 a bizarre self-portrait that clashes violently with the reality of his conviction for orchestrating a doomsday-fueled murder plot.\n\nThe insanity of this letter is in the contradictions: Daybell attempts to wrap himself in nostalgia, music, and missionary zeal while ignoring the lives destroyed by his actions. It\u2019s another manipulative rewrite from a man the jury found guilty of cold-blooded killings.\n\nIn this episode, we break down Daybell\u2019s prison narrative, exploring how his words reveal denial, delusion, and an ongoing effort to control his legacy from behind bars.\n\n#ChadDaybell #LoriVallow #TammyDaybell #TyleeRyan #JJVallow #DeathRow #CultMurders #TrueCrime #HiddenKillers\n\nWant to comment and watch this podcast as a video?

      "description": "\u200BChad Daybell \u2014 sentenced to death for murdering his wife Tammy Daybell and Lori Vallow\u2019s children, Tylee and J.J. \u2014 has released yet another prison letter, this time spinning a detailed story about Tammy\u2019s supposed health decline leading up to her death in 2019.\n\nIn this account, Daybell paints a picture of Tammy as a devoted wife, mother, animal lover, librarian, and gardener, while chronicling fainting spells, bloating, fatigue, and a \u201Csudden\u201D death that he claims shocked the family. He even laces the narrative with LDS spiritual encounters and nostalgic family memories, all while insisting she died of natural causes.\n\nThe insanity of this letter is that it reads like an elaborate cover story \u2014 a murderer rewriting history from his cell on Death Row. Instead of taking responsibility for what a jury unanimously decided was a calculated, apocalyptic murder plot, Daybell uses pages of personal anecdotes and religious imagery to portray himself as a loving husband blindsided by tragedy.\n\nIn this episode, we dissect the contradictions in Chad Daybell\u2019s writing, exposing how his prison letters attempt to sanitize the reality of Tammy\u2019s murder, erase his role in the \u201Cdoomsday cult\u201D killings, and manipulate perception as he fights for appeals.\n\nSubscribe for more in-depth breakdowns as we continue uncovering the chilling disconnect between Daybell\u2019s words and the horrific truth.\n\n#ChadDaybell #TammyDaybell #LoriVallow #TyleeRyan #JJVallow #CultMurders #DeathRow #TrueCrime #HiddenKillers\n\nWant to comment and watch this podcast as a video?

In it, he waxes poetic about their love story, their early marriage, their publishing company, their shared passion for music, and their family life, all while denying he ever harmed her.\n\nThe insanity of this letter lies in its surreal disconnect: a convicted murderer romanticizing his \u201Cforever love\u201D with the wife a jury unanimously concluded he conspired to kill. Daybell paints himself as a devoted husband and family man, while the reality remains that Tammy\u2019s sudden death was part of the doomsday-fueled scheme that also claimed the lives of two innocent children.\n\nIn this episode, we break down Chad Daybell\u2019s disturbing attempt to rewrite history, looking at how he uses sentimentality, faith, and nostalgia to cast himself as the victim of media lies \u2014 and why these prison writings may be less about Tammy\u2019s memory and more about manipulation and control.\n\nSubscribe for more in-depth true crime analysis as we continue exposing the chilling contradictions in the Daybell\u2013Vallow saga.\n\n#ChadDaybell #TammyDaybell #LoriVallow #TyleeRyan #JJVallow #CultMurders #DeathRow #TrueCrime #HiddenKillers\n\u200BWant to comment and watch this podcast as a video?

      "description": "In one of the most emotionally charged moments of the Lori Vallow Daybell sentencing in Arizona, Larry and Kay Woodcock delivered unforgettable victim impact statements. Their words weren\u2019t just about punishment \u2014 they were a raw, powerful memorial to the people Lori helped destroy.\n\nKay Woodcock read a heartbreaking letter written from the perspective of her murdered grandson, JJ Vallow. \u201CI should be 13 now,\u201D she read, \u201Cbut I\u2019m forever seven\u2026 I trusted you.\u201D The courtroom was left silent, the weight of those words settling heavy over everyone. It was a moment of unimaginable grief, wrapped in a message of love and betrayal.\n\nThen came Larry. His delivery was fiery, unapologetic, and deeply personal. He called Lori a narcissist, a psychopath, and a murderess. He spared no detail in describing the devastation she left behind \u2014 not just in lives lost, but in the emotional carnage that followed. His voice shook, but his message was unshakable: Lori Vallow was no misunderstood mother. She was a cold, calculating killer who tore families apart.\n\nThis episode dives deep into those statements, examining how victim impact testimony influences sentencing and helps reclaim power in a courtroom often dominated by the accused. We\u2019ll explore what these words meant to the Woodcocks, to the judge, and to a public that\u2019s followed this disturbing case from day one.\n\nIf you want to understand the real cost of Lori Vallow\u2019s actions, it\u2019s in these voices \u2014 the ones still standing.\n\n#LoriVallow #JJVallow #KayWoodcock #LarryWoodcock #VictimImpact #JusticeForJJ #SentencingHearing #TrueCrimePodcast #HiddenKillers #DoomsdayMom\n\n\n\n\u200BWant to comment and watch this podcast as a video?

      "description": "It was less a legal argument and more a psychological showcase. Lori Vallow Daybell\u2019s sentencing speech wasn\u2019t just strange \u2014 it was downright surreal. Representing herself in court, she took the stand and delivered what might go down as one of the most bizarre courtroom performances in true crime history.\n\nOver the course of her statement, Lori invoked religious visions, referenced biblical betrayal, claimed persecution by the justice system, and refused to show remorse for any of the lives lost. She called the case a \u201Cfamily tragedy\u201D rather than a crime. She rambled about angels, spirits, and justice from a higher plane. She even went so far as to suggest that if people truly understood the spiritual truth behind the events, they would forgive her.\n\nJudge Beresky wasn\u2019t having it. He interrupted her multiple times, asked her to remain relevant, and eventually reprimanded her for using the courtroom as a stage rather than a legal venue. His message was clear: this wasn\u2019t a pulpit for self-righteous delusion \u2014 this was about justice.\n\nIn this episode, we break down every disturbing, bewildering moment. What was she trying to accomplish? Did her strategy backfire? Was this the last gasp of control from a woman who\u2019s lost everything? Or just another chapter in the ongoing psychological unraveling of the so-called \u201CDoomsday Mom\u201D?\n\nFrom legal analysis to behavioral interpretation, we dissect this unforgettable moment in the Lori Vallow saga.

Testimony reveals that the victims were lured to a trailer under false pretenses and murdered in a religiously motivated plot led by Tifany Adams, the children\u2019s grandmother, amid a custody dispute. Grice admitted Adams asked him to kill Butler and used Bible verses to justify the act, while Twombly described her role in destroying evidence.

      "description": "In June 2025, law enforcement descended on a small Iowa town to execute one of the largest child removal operations in the state\u0027s history. 88 children were evacuated from the Shekinah Glory Camp in Columbus Junction, launching a human trafficking investigation that would expose troubling questions about religious authority, refugee vulnerability, and alleged exploitation.\nThe Kingdom Ministry of Rehabilitation and Recreation, run by Burmese pastors in a town where 25% of residents are Myanmar refugees, operated what they claimed was a Bible camp for addiction recovery. But when a 15-year-old from Texas made a desperate call to authorities, it triggered a multi-agency raid involving the Louisa County Sheriff\u0027s Office, Iowa DHS, and state criminal investigators.\nIn this video, we examine:\n\nThe timeline of events leading to the raid\nWhy authorities launched a trafficking investigation\nThe vulnerable Burmese refugee community targeted\nHow 60\u002B people lived in 5 mobile homes\nThe ministry\u0027s claims vs. what investigators found\nLegal precedents from similar religious compound cases\nWhy no arrests have been made (yet)\n\nThis case sits at the intersection of immigration, religious freedom, and child protection - raising critical questions about oversight of faith-based organizations serving vulnerable populations.\n\u26A0\uFE0F This is an active investigation. All individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.\n\uD83D\uDCE7 Submit tips: [your email]\n\uD83D\uDD14 Subscribe for updates on this developing case\nChapters:\n00:00 The Raid\n[Add timestamps as needed]\nSources: Louisa County Sheriff\u0027s Office, Iowa DHS, KWQC, The Gazette, WQAD\nHashtags:\n#ShekinahGloryCamp #IowaTrueCrime #KingdomMinistry #ColumbusJunction #HumanTraffickingCase #ReligiousCamp #BurmeseRefugees #MyanmarCommunity #TrueCrime2025 #ChildRescue #IowaInvestigation #CultInvestigation #ReligiousExploitation #RefugeeCommunity #BibleCampRaid #TrueCrimeCommunity #ActiveInvestigation #ChildTrafficking #ReligiousFreedom #JusticeFor88 #IowaCrime #ChurchScandal #BreakingTrueCrime #CriminalInvestigation #MinistryScandal\u200B\n\nWant to comment and watch this podcast as a video?

Fresh off her first-ever on-camera interview, she\u0027s still doubling down on her delusions, claiming Jesus personally assured her she and Chad would be exonerated. Because, you know, visions trump a life sentence and a guilty verdict.\n\nPsychotherapist and author Shavaun Scott joins the discussion, breaking down how Lori\u0027s unwavering belief system isn\u2019t just a stubborn personality trait\u2014it\u0027s likely the result of a rare and severe delusional disorder. Could this have been avoided if she\u2019d never crossed paths with Chad Daybell, or was this path inevitable? And what about Alex Cox\u2014was he suffering from the same disorder, or just a dangerously devoted follower?\n\nWhen two people\u2019s delusions feed off each other, where does the manipulation end and the madness begin?\n\n#LoriVallow #TrueCrime #PsychologyOfEvil #ChadDaybell #HiddenKillers #DelusionalDisorder #CultMindset\n\nSubscribe \u0026 Listen on Apple Podcasts: https://shorturl.at/opFUZ\nSpotify: https://shorturl.at/eksC5\n\nFollow Us On Social Media: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hiddenkillerspod/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hiddenkillerspod\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hiddenkillerspod/\n\n#truecrime #truecrimecommunity #murdermystery #unsolvedmysteries\n#coldcase #truecrimepodcast #documentary #justicefor #truecrimeaddict #crimejunkie",

That\u2019s the question swirling around Kevin Franke, who spent a year estranged from his wife, Ruby, and their kids\u2014only to seemingly jump right back into the chaos when given the chance. Even as disturbing truths about alleged child abuse surfaced, he clung to the belief that Ruby and Jodi Hildebrandt had everything under control.\n\nWas it brainwashing? An addiction to a toxic relationship? Or was Kevin simply so deep in denial that reality didn\u2019t stand a chance? Retired FBI Special Agent Robin Dreeke breaks down the psychological stronghold that kept Kevin tethered to an allegedly abusive dynamic, even as the walls of his world came crashing down. And with Kevin now fighting for custody of his children, the question remains\u2014should he get them back? Or is he still too lost in the wreckage to be the father they need?\n\n#TrueCrime #KevinFranke #RubyFranke #JodiHildebrandt #ChildAbuse #PsychologicalManipulation #HiddenKillers\n\nSubscribe \u0026 Listen on Apple Podcasts: https://shorturl.at/opFUZ Spotify: https://shorturl.at/eksC5 Follow Us On Social Media: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/hiddenkillerspod/ TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hiddenkillerspod Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/hiddenkillerspod/ #truecrime #truecrimecommunity #murdermystery #unsolvedmysteries #coldcase #truecrimepodcast #documentary #justicefor #truecrimeaddict #crimejunkie",

      "description": "At some point, reality catches up with delusion. For Chad and Lori, that moment came when their doomsday prophecy failed, the bodies were found, and the world demanded answers.\n\nThis episode follows the unraveling of their belief system, from the moment their July 2020 doomsday prediction never came true to the mounting pressure from law enforcement and national media. Lori\u2019s chilling lack of emotion after her children disappeared and her refusal to cooperate with investigators only fueled the fire. Chad, once seen as a spiritual leader, suddenly found himself a fugitive, his so-called prophetic status crumbling under legal scrutiny.\n\nThrough court testimonies, expert breakdowns, and official LDS responses, we explore how justice was finally served. Chad and Lori\u2019s religious justifications were torn apart in court, and their former followers turned against them. The trial exposed the full extent of their manipulation, their self-serving doctrine, and the horrifying reality of what they had done in the name of their so-called divine mission.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t just a story about a crime\u2014it was a case study in radicalization, cult psychology, and the dangers of unchecked belief.\n\nSubscribe \u0026 Listen on Apple Podcasts: https://shorturl.at/opFUZ Spotify: https://shorturl.at/eksC5 Follow Us On Social Media: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/hiddenkillerspod/ TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hiddenkillerspod Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/hiddenkillerspod/ #truecrime #truecrimecommunity #murdermystery #unsolvedmysteries #coldcase #truecrimepodcast #documentary #justicefor #truecrimeaddict #crimejunkie",

      "description": "Chad and Lori weren\u2019t just theorizing about the apocalypse\u2014they were actively preparing for it. This episode takes you inside the cult-like rituals that cemented their control over their small but devoted group of followers. From prayer circles and casting ceremonies to exorcisms meant to drive out \u201Cdark spirits,\u201D we reveal the manipulative practices they used to create an unshakable belief system where questioning was not allowed.\n\nOnce Chad and Lori had their followers\u2019 trust, the next step was eliminating the obstacles\u2014anyone who didn\u2019t fit into their end-times prophecy. Their doctrine of \u201Czombies\u201D and demonic possession became a convenient excuse to justify murder. When Chad prophesied that his wife Tammy would soon die, she did. When Lori declared her own children were no longer \u201Cthemselves,\u201D they vanished.\n\nThrough chilling text messages, firsthand testimonies, and expert psychological analysis, we examine how Lori and Chad stripped away their moral inhibitions. By the time law enforcement caught on, the body count was growing. What made them believe that murder was righteous? And how did their manipulation techniques turn everyday people into accomplices?\n\nSubscribe \u0026 Listen on Apple Podcasts: https://shorturl.at/opFUZ Spotify: https://shorturl.at/eksC5 Follow Us On Social Media: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/hiddenkillerspod/ TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hiddenkillerspod Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/hiddenkillerspod/ #truecrime #truecrimecommunity #murdermystery #unsolvedmysteries #coldcase #truecrimepodcast #documentary #justicefor #truecrimeaddict #crimejunkie",

      "description": "Once Chad Daybell and Lori Vallow believed they were chosen by God, their doctrine evolved into a radical, self-serving theology that justified their crimes. In this episode, we break down the specific tenets of their belief system, from Chad\u2019s doomsday timelines predicting the world would end in July 2020 to the twisted reincarnation doctrine known as \u201Cmultiple mortal probations.\u201D\n\nTheir obsession with end-times prophecy was fueled by LDS tent-city survivalist movements, where members believed they would be called to gather in safe zones before the world collapsed. But Chad and Lori took it further, convincing themselves that some souls were no longer human at all. Through their bizarre \u201Clight vs. dark\u201D ranking system, they determined who was \u201Cworthy\u201D to move forward\u2014and who had become a zombie that needed to be eliminated.\n\nWe also explore their belief in divine powers, including Lori\u2019s claim that she was immortal and Chad\u2019s so-called spiritual portal. These doctrines weren\u2019t just harmless religious speculation\u2014they were the foundation of a doomsday cult that led to multiple murders. How did Chad and Lori justify their actions as part of their divine mission? And what happens when a prophecy fails but the believers refuse to accept it?\n\nSubscribe \u0026 Listen on Apple Podcasts: https://shorturl.at/opFUZ Spotify: https://shorturl.at/eksC5 Follow Us On Social Media: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/hiddenkillerspod/ TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hiddenkillerspod Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/hiddenkillerspod/ #truecrime #truecrimecommunity #murdermystery #unsolvedmysteries #coldcase #truecrimepodcast #documentary #justicefor #truecrimeaddict #crimejunkies",

      "description": "The story of Chad Daybell and Lori Vallow didn\u2019t start with murder\u2014it started with faith twisted into fanaticism. In this episode, we explore the LDS Church\u2019s core beliefs, how mainstream Mormonism views prophecy and the Second Coming, and how Chad and Lori veered from religious devotion into dangerous extremism. Chad\u2019s near-death experiences convinced him he had access to divine knowledge, while Lori\u2019s obsession with end-times prophecy led her to believe she was a goddess chosen to gather the righteous. How did a simple belief in personal revelation and spiritual preparedness turn into an apocalyptic worldview that justified murder?\n\nWe break down Chad\u2019s early writings, his rise in LDS prepping circles, and how fiction became fact in his mind. We also examine Lori\u2019s transformation from a devoted Mormon mother to a self-proclaimed leader of the 144,000. By tracking their path from faith to fanaticism, we expose the psychological and religious factors that led them to classify people as \u201Clight\u201D or \u201Cdark,\u201D ultimately determining who lived and who died.\n\nThrough expert analysis and firsthand accounts, this episode lays the groundwork for understanding how a dangerous cult ideology took root within the framework of a mainstream religion. How did their beliefs develop? What warning signs were ignored? And could this have been stopped before it spiraled into murder?\n\nSubscribe \u0026 Listen on Apple Podcasts: https://shorturl.at/opFUZ Spotify: https://shorturl.at/eksC5 Follow Us On Social Media: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/hiddenkillerspod/ TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hiddenkillerspod Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/hiddenkillerspod/ #truecrime #truecrimecommunity #murdermystery #unsolvedmysteries #coldcase #truecrimepodcast #documentary #justicefor #truecrimeaddict #crimejunkie",

      "title": "Lori Vallow Daybell Wants Court TV Cameras Out Her Trial... Claims Slander",
      "description": "Lori Vallow Daybell, convicted murderer and self-proclaimed prophet, is gearing up for another courtroom battle, this time in Arizona. And in true Vallow fashion, she\u2019s already trying to control the narrative. Representing herself, she\u2019s filed an objection with the Maricopa County Superior Court, demanding that Court TV be banned from streaming the proceedings. Her reasoning? She claims the network is profiting off her tragedy and misrepresenting her in their coverage.\n\nNow, let\u2019s be clear\u2014Court TV is in the business of true crime entertainment. That\u2019s not exactly breaking news. But Vallow\u2019s sudden concern for journalistic integrity is ironic, to say the least, considering she\u2019s been at the center of a twisted saga of deception, manipulation, and murder.\n\nVallow alleges that the network has used her and her husband, Chad Daybell, in promotional materials that have \u0022falsely characterized, libeled, and slandered\u0022 them. That\u2019s quite a claim coming from someone who has already been convicted of killing two of her own children, along with her husband\u0027s first wife. Daybell, for his part, has been sentenced to death in Idaho for his role in those murders.\n\nChicago-based attorney Andrew Stoltmann sees right through her play. He believes Vallow is setting the stage for a circus\u2014one where she\u2019s the ringleader. By representing herself, she gains control over courtroom theatrics, with little to lose since she\u2019s already serving a life sentence in Idaho. And if things don\u2019t go her way? Self-representation could set her up for an ineffective counsel argument on appeal.\n\nThis latest trial stems from a 2021 indictment, in which a grand jury in Arizona charged Vallow with conspiracy to commit murder in the death of her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, and attempted murder of her niece\u2019s ex-husband, Brandon Boudreaux. Prosecutors say Charles was shot and killed by Lori\u2019s brother, Alex Cox, in 2019 in what was initially deemed self-defense. But as the bodies started piling up around Lori, investigators took another look. Cox, who conveniently died of an apparent blood clot months later, was also accused of conspiring with his sister in the attempted murder of Boudreaux.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of a tangled web of so-called \u0022doomsday\u0022 beliefs, where Vallow and Daybell convinced themselves\u2014and a select group of followers\u2014that they were chosen by God to prepare for the end times. And in their twisted version of righteousness, getting rid of \u201Cdark spirits\u201D meant eliminating people who stood in their way.\n\nOf course, the public fascination with this case exploded when the bodies of seven-year-old J.J. Vallow and sixteen-year-old Tylee Ryan were found buried on Daybell\u2019s property in 2020. The children had been missing for months while Vallow and Daybell were off in Hawaii, seemingly unbothered. When authorities finally caught up with them, the excuses were endless. But by the time the trial rolled around, it was clear that no amount of religious justification could explain away the horrors uncovered in Idaho.\n\nA jury convicted Vallow on all counts, and in July 2023, she was sentenced to life in prison without parole. At her sentencing, Judge Steven Boyce didn\u2019t hold back. He told Vallow, \u0022You had so many other options. You chose the most evil and destructive path possible.\u0022 Prosecutors and experts alike have pointed to Vallow\u2019s psychiatric evaluations, which diagnosed her with delusional disorder, hyper-religiosity, and narcissistic tendencies. But none of it was enough to declare her legally insane.\n\nNow, as she prepares for her Arizona trial, Vallow has once again been granted a mental health evaluation. But if history is any indicator, she will likely be deemed competent to stand trial\u2014meaning the next chapter of this saga is set to unfold in court on March 31.\n\nDespite her best efforts, cameras have been a fixture in this case from the beginning, and this time will likely be no different. Judges have weighed the pros and cons of public trials since O.J. Simpson\u2019s infamous courtroom spectacle, and while some believe transparency is key, others argue that it turns legal proceedings into a performance. If anyone\u2019s likely to take advantage of that, it\u2019s Lori Vallow.\n\nWhether or not Court TV gets its live feed, one thing is certain\u2014Vallow\u2019s fight for control won\u2019t stop here.\n\n#LoriDaybell #TrueCrime #CourtTV #MurderTrial\n\nSubscribe \u0026 Listen on Apple Podcasts: https://shorturl.at/opFUZ Spotify: https://shorturl.at/eksC5 Follow Us On Social Media: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/hiddenkillerspod/ TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hiddenkillerspod Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/hiddenkillerspod/ #truecrime #truecrimecommunity #murdermystery #unsolvedmysteries #coldcase #truecrimepodcast #documentary #justicefor #truecrimeaddict #crimejunkie",

      "description": "In this episode of \u0022Hidden Killers With Tony Brueski,\u0022 retired FBI Special Agent Robin Dreeke discusses the psychological effects of cult-like belief systems and their impact on individuals involved in high-profile legal cases like those of Chad Daybell and Lori Vallow. Dreeke explores how deeply ingrained beliefs and the need for belonging can affect people\u0027s perceptions and reactions when faced with the reality of their actions, especially when those actions conflict with societal norms. He elaborates on the difficulty some individuals face in reconciling their actions with their belief systems, often resulting in cognitive dissonance where they cannot accept reality even when confronted with irrefutable evidence. Key Points from the Conversation - **Cult-like Belief Systems:** Dreeke discusses how individuals involved in cults struggle to distance themselves from their beliefs even when faced with legal consequences or societal rejection. - **Cognitive Dissonance:** Members of these groups often exhibit cognitive dissonance, rationalizing their actions within their belief system despite evidence to the contrary. - **Echo Chambers:** The conversation touches on how echo chambers reinforce existing beliefs, making it difficult for individuals to accept contrary evidence. - **Social Needs and Group Belonging:** Dreeke highlights the human need to belong to groups and how this can lead people to remain in harmful situations or belief systems. - **Challenges in Changing Beliefs:** The discussion explores why it\u0027s hard for some people to change their views, even when faced with overwhelming evidence or after experiencing major life events. - **Impact on Legal Defense:** The ingrained beliefs and the public revelation of private communications can significantly undermine a legal defense, as seen in the trials of Chad Daybell and others. #HiddenKillersWithTonyBrueski #RobinDreeke #CultBeliefs #CognitiveDissonance #ChadDaybell #LoriVallow #EchoChambers Want to listen to ALL of our podcasts AD-FREE?

      "description": "In this episode of \u0027Hidden Killers With Tony Brueski,\u0027 psychotherapist and author Shavaun Scott delves into the complex psychological factors surrounding belief persistence and fanaticism. Discussing the case of Richard Allen in the Delphi murder trial, Shavaun explores how bizarre and inconsistent confessions, possibly influenced by psychological breakdowns in solitary confinement, challenge the credibility of his admissions. The discussion expands into the psychology of false confessions, highlighting how solitary confinement and coercive interrogation can distort reality for individuals. Shavaun stresses the importance of understanding the psychological mechanisms that cause some people to cling to disproven beliefs, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. She explains that confronting such individuals with direct opposition often reinforces their beliefs, suggesting that gentle questioning might be more effective in introducing doubt.\n\n **Main Points of the Conversation:**\n   - **Richard Allen\u0027s Confessions:** Analyzed the validity of Allen\u0027s confessions, noting discrepancies with actual events and suggesting they may be products of his psychological state.\n   - **Psychology of Belief:** Discussed how individuals may persist in their beliefs despite contradicting evidence, often worsening when directly challenged.\n   - **False Confessions:** Highlighted the prevalence of false confessions in the criminal justice system, particularly under coercive conditions or mental duress.\n   - **Influence of Isolation:** Explored the detrimental effects of solitary confinement on mental health, potentially leading to delusions and false admissions.\n   - **Strategies for Persuasion:** Considered approaches to help individuals reassess their beliefs, emphasizing empathy and gentle questioning over confrontation.\n   - **Community and Belief Reinforcement:** Noted how modern online platforms can reinforce extreme beliefs, creating communities that validate and escalate dangerous ideologies.\n\n#TonyBrueski #ShavaunScott #RichardAllen #DelphiMurders #FalseConfessions #PsychologyOfBelief #SolitaryConfinement\n\nSubscribe \u0026 Listen on Apple Podcasts: https://shorturl.at/opFUZ\nSpotify: https://shorturl.at/eksC5\n\nFollow Us On Social Media: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hiddenkillerspod/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hiddenkillerspod\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hiddenkillerspod/\n\n#truecrime #truecrimecommunity #murdermystery #unsolvedmysteries\n#coldcase #truecrimepodcast #documentary #justicefor #truecrimeaddict #crimejunkie",

      "description": "Is a convincing apology enough to earn early release? Could convicted child abusers Ruby Frankie and Jody Hildebrandt manipulate their way out of prison? On this episode of \u0022Hidden Killers\u0022, Tony Brueski and psychotherapist Shavaun Scott dissect the sentencing of Ruby Frankie and Jody Hildebrandt. Sentenced to four to sixty years for their horrific abuse, their ultimate fate rests in the hands of the parole board. Shavaun analyzes Ruby Frankie\u0027s courtroom statement, calling it a \u0022coached response\u0022 aimed at manipulating the system. Tony questions if parole boards are easily swayed by such performances, or if genuine remorse can be faked. The discussion then turns to Jody Hildebrandt\u0027s claim that she \u0022sincerely loved these children,\u0022 a statement Shavaun links to the narcissistic tendencies often found in cult leaders. With the possibility of release looming, the podcast delves into the chilling question of whether these women pose a continued threat to the public. Could they resurface under new identities, preying on the vulnerable once again? Closing Question: How do we protect ourselves and our communities from those who mask their monstrous behavior behind a facade of love and concern? Want to listen to ALL of our podcasts AD-FREE?
