So we look into when women \u0022win,\u0022 what that means for their relationship with the church and its leadership, as well as their marriages (or former marriages). Megan (and her family) were horrifically abused by her ex-husband, and you\u0027ll hear what kind of counsel came from the mouth of Jim, which then starts making more sense of Doug. The apple doesn\u0027t fall far from the tree.\n\nBecause for these men and leaders, a woman who\u0027s too opinionated needs to be put her in place.\n\nBelow them.\n\n\nDonate to help the survivor network: https://donorbox.org/outreach-launch\nPrivate Survivor Support Join our Private Survivor Support Group: https://www.facebook.com/share/g/15c9WLT4Dj/?mibextid=K35XfP\n\nSign up for our Patreon here: www.patreon.com/sonsofpatriarchy\nVisit www.sonsofpatriarchy.com to find resources, recommended reading, and more.\n\nSons of Patriarchy Social Media:\nTwitter: www.x.com/patriarchysons\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/patriarchysons\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/patriarchysons\nTikTok: https://shorturl.at/46Vio\n\nExamining Doug Wilson and Moscow Social Media:\nTwitter: www.x.com/examiningmoscow\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/examiningmoscow\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/examiningmoscow\n\nSons of Patriarchy is brought to you by:\nProducer, Writer, Editor, and Host: Peter Bell\nAssistant Producer: Examining Doug Wilson and Moscow\nOriginal Music, Sound Design, and Mixing: https://aaronfeeneymusic.com/\nSocial Media: Sarah Bader\nGraphic Design: Anonymous Survivors\n\nSURVIVORS - THANK YOU, AND MAY YOU BE HEARD.",

Sex becomes a conquering act, not the beautiful union of a man and a woman who love one another. Women are receptacles for the pleasure of men, marriage a plan for taking over the world, and spanking kids the key to obedience and warriors in the quiver of the father. Mothers required only because they\u2019re needed for the birth, not because they contribute anything, but because men can\u2019t do it on their own.\n\nSex is beautiful, families are beautiful, and children are beautiful. But none of these are ultimate. All of these are wonderful blessings of God. But none are tools for our gain.\n\nThe Savior came not to be served, but to serve, and give his life a ransom for many.

The virtuous woman *only* stays at home, homeschools her children, satisfies her husband, and makes sure there\u0027s no ugliness in her. They are to stay silent, unless, of course, they\u0027ve been approved to teacher other women to... stay silent. You can speak, as long as you tell other women not to.\n\nAt the same time women are more liable to deceit than their male counterparts they also hold the power to cause their brothers to stumble. It\u0027s a whiplash, a system wherein you\u0027re told to be feminine, but not too feminine, smart, but not too smart, put together, but not independent.\n\nIn summary, it\u0027s impossible. A standard you can never live up to. But there\u0027s another way, the way of Jesus.

The Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God. But what happens when you\u0027ve entered into a culture war? The perceived \u0022feminization\u0022 of the Evangelical church presents to you a problem: how do we fight this? Enter the old heresy of the Father as \u0022authority\u0022 and the Son as \u0022submission.\u0022 The man in the marriage mirrors God the Father\u0027s role, while the wife is subjugated to that of the Son.\n\nWhat better to keep women under control than to tell them to \u0022suffer like Jesus.\u0022 The Trinity then becomes the foundation for gender roles.\n\nLet\u0027s fix this.\n\nDonate to help the survivor network: https://donorbox.org/outreach-launch\nJoin our Private Survivor Support Group: https://www.facebook.com/share/g/15c9WLT4Dj/?mibextid=K35XfP\n\nSign up for our Patreon here: www.patreon.com/sonsofpatriarchy\nVisit www.sonsofpatriarchy.com to find resources, recommended reading, and more.\n\nSons of Patriarchy Social Media:\nTwitter: www.x.com/patriarchysons\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/patriarchysons\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/patriarchysons\nTikTok: https://shorturl.at/46Vio\n\nExamining Doug Wilson and Moscow Social Media:\nTwitter: www.x.com/examiningmoscow\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/examiningmoscow\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/examiningmoscow\n\nSons of Patriarchy is brought to you by:\nProducer, Writer, Editor, and Host: Peter Bell\nAssistant Producer: Examining Doug Wilson and Moscow\nOriginal Music, Sound Design, and Mixing: https://aaronfeeneymusic.com/\nSocial Media: Sarah Bader\nGraphic Design: Anonymous Survivors\n\nSURVIVORS - THANK YOU, AND MAY YOU BE HEARD.",

Figure out where this thing called Christian Nationalism came from.\nCatholic Integralism is both intellectually superior of, and far more historically grounded counterpart to Christian Nationalism. Kevin Vallier (Professor of Philosophy at the University of Toledo) discusses the rise of Catholic Integralism, the Protestant response, and where Christian Nationalism fits into that picture (if it does at all).\nFrom Catholic Integralism, we move forward a few hundred hears to the founding of the American Republic. Jerome Copulsky (Research Fellow at the Berkley Center at Georgetown University) analyzes the political and religious traditions of the 18th and 19th centuries, dispelling rumors about America\u0027s founding while providing a politically (and religiously) robust reading of the nation\u0027s constitution and supporting documents.\nAll the Kingdoms of the World by Kevin Vallier\nAmerican Heretics by Jerome Copulsky\n\u00A0\nDonate to help the survivor network here.\nJoin: Private Survivor Support Group.\nSign up for our Patreon here.\nVisit sonsofpatriarchy.com to find resources, recommended reading, and more.\nSocial Media: Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, and TikTok.\nExamining Doug Wilson and Moscow: Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook\n\u00A0\n\u0022Sons of Patriarchy\u0022 is brought to you by\nProducer, Writer, Editor, and Host: Peter Bell\nOriginal Music, Sound Design, and Mixing: https://aaronfeeneymusic.com/\nSocial Media: Sarah Bader\nGraphic Design: Anonymous Survivors\nSURVIVORS - THANK YOU, AND MAY YOU BE HEARD.",

Most were known by their rhetorical power, calvinistic soteriology, and movement-building prowess. But they\u0027ve all got a spiritual father, a Patriarch, if you will.\nMaybe you listened to the 2021 podcast series \u0022The Rise and Fall of Mars Hill,\u0022 and wondered, \u0022Where did Driscoll come from?\u0022 Well, he took what Doug Wilson had written, and preached it. Driscoll appealed to men like never before, with an in-your-face message, that beat you up and left you satisfied, longing for more. Many others have followed in his wake, but like all modern philosophers to Plato, they\u0027re simply building on Wilson.\nListen in as we talk with Nick Gier, Professor Emeritus at the University of Idaho (Doug\u0027s former professor), and Russell Moore, Editor in Chief at Christianity Today, about Doug\u0027s beginnings, those whom he\u0027s influenced, and where they see this going.\n\u00A0\n\u0022Sons of Patriarchy\u0022 is brought to you by\nProducer, Writer, Editor, and Host: Peter Bell\nOriginal Music, Sound Design, and Mixing: https://aaronfeeneymusic.com/\nSocial Media: Sarah Bader\nGraphic Design: Anonymous Survivors\nSURVIVORS - THANK YOU, AND MAY YOU BE HEARD.",
