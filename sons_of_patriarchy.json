Contact the Presbyterian Advocacy Coalition: https://www.presbyterianadvocacycoalition.org\n\nMeet Theresa Garcia Robertson, Zach LeReaux, and Caroline McKuen.\n\nTheresa is a former member of Covenant OPC in La Grange, Georgia, pastored by Boyd Miller. Zach is Ali\u0027s husband (from Let\u0027s Get Spiritual), and will shed light on how men should engage with and respond to those who\u0027ve been abused. Caroline McKuen is the director and founder of the Presbyterian Advocacy Coalition.\n\nFor too long these cases and stories have been covered up, whether that be for \u0022lack of evidence,\u0022 or \u0022sinful, but not criminal,\u0022 or \u0022undue gossip.\u0022 Women have been silenced (as have some men), men have been coerced (as have some women), presbyteries have turned a blind eye, and the \u0022good\u0022 men in authority, and the churches they pastor do nothing while people suffer.\n\nWe\u0027ve got something to say about that.\n\nDonate to help the survivor network: https://donorbox.org/outreach-launch\nPrivate Survivor Support Join our Private Survivor Support Group: https://www.facebook.com/share/g/15c9WLT4Dj/?mibextid=K35XfP\n\nSign up for our Patreon here: www.patreon.com/sonsofpatriarchy\nVisit www.sonsofpatriarchy.com to find resources, recommended reading, and more.\n\nSons of Patriarchy Social Media:\nTwitter: www.x.com/patriarchysons\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/patriarchysons\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/patriarchysons\nTikTok: https://shorturl.at/46Vio\n\nExamining Doug Wilson and Moscow Social Media:\nTwitter: www.x.com/examiningmoscow\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/examiningmoscow\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/examiningmoscow\n\nSons of Patriarchy is brought to you by:\nProducer, Writer, Editor, and Host: Peter Bell\nAssistant Producer: Examining Doug Wilson and Moscow\nOriginal Music, Sound Design, and Mixing: https://aaronfeeneymusic.com/\nSocial Media: Sarah Bader\nGraphic Design: Anonymous Survivors\n\nSURVIVORS - THANK YOU, AND MAY YOU BE HEARD.",

Figure out where this thing called Christian Nationalism came from.\nCatholic Integralism is both intellectually superior of, and far more historically grounded counterpart to Christian Nationalism. Kevin Vallier (Professor of Philosophy at the University of Toledo) discusses the rise of Catholic Integralism, the Protestant response, and where Christian Nationalism fits into that picture (if it does at all).\nFrom Catholic Integralism, we move forward a few hundred hears to the founding of the American Republic. Jerome Copulsky (Research Fellow at the Berkley Center at Georgetown University) analyzes the political and religious traditions of the 18th and 19th centuries, dispelling rumors about America\u0027s founding while providing a politically (and religiously) robust reading of the nation\u0027s constitution and supporting documents.\nAll the Kingdoms of the World by Kevin Vallier\nAmerican Heretics by Jerome Copulsky\n\u00A0\nDonate to help the survivor network here.\nJoin: Private Survivor Support Group.\nSign up for our Patreon here.\nVisit sonsofpatriarchy.com to find resources, recommended reading, and more.\nSocial Media: Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, and TikTok.\nExamining Doug Wilson and Moscow: Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook\n\u00A0\n\u0022Sons of Patriarchy\u0022 is brought to you by\nProducer, Writer, Editor, and Host: Peter Bell\nOriginal Music, Sound Design, and Mixing: https://aaronfeeneymusic.com/\nSocial Media: Sarah Bader\nGraphic Design: Anonymous Survivors\nSURVIVORS - THANK YOU, AND MAY YOU BE HEARD.",

Most were known by their rhetorical power, calvinistic soteriology, and movement-building prowess.

Driscoll appealed to men like never before, with an in-your-face message, that beat you up and left you satisfied, longing for more. Many others have followed in his wake, but like all modern philosophers to Plato, they\u0027re simply building on Wilson.\nListen in as we talk with Nick Gier, Professor Emeritus at the University of Idaho (Doug\u0027s former professor), and Russell Moore, Editor in Chief at Christianity Today, about Doug\u0027s beginnings, those whom he\u0027s influenced, and where they see this going.\n\u00A0\n\u0022Sons of Patriarchy\u0022 is brought to you by\nProducer, Writer, Editor, and Host: Peter Bell\nOriginal Music, Sound Design, and Mixing: https://aaronfeeneymusic.com/\nSocial Media: Sarah Bader\nGraphic Design: Anonymous Survivors\nSURVIVORS - THANK YOU, AND MAY YOU BE HEARD.",

One thing is for sure, they\u0027re influential. What started in the late 70s has blossomed into a worldwide movement, making Christian Nationalism... national. From a small college town, Moscow, Idaho, meet the pastor and movement that is influencing American politics, and infiltrating American churches.\n\nIn this inaugural episode, Kristin Kobes Du Mez talks about the decades leading up to the rise of Doug Wilson.
