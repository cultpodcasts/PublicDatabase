Everyone else? Figure out where this thing called Christian Nationalism came from.\n\nCatholic Integralism is both intellectually superior of, and far more historically grounded counterpart to Christian Nationalism. Kevin Vallier (Professor of Philosophy at the University of Toledo) discusses the rise of Catholic Integralism, the Protestant response, and where Christian Nationalism fits into that picture (if it does at all).\n\nFrom Catholic Integralism, we move forward a few hundred hears to the founding of the American Republic. Jerome Copulsky (Research Fellow at the Berkley Center at Georgetown University) analyzes the political and religious traditions of the 18th and 19th centuries, dispelling rumors about America\u0027s founding while providing a politically (and religiously) robust reading of the nation\u0027s constitution and supporting documents.\n\nAll the Kingdoms of the World by Kevin Vallier: https://shorturl.at/wpj4b\nAmerican Heretics by Jerome Copulsky: https://shorturl.at/kJPZi\n\nSons of Patriarchy is brought to you by:\nProducer, Writer, Editor, and Host: Peter Bell\nOriginal Music, Sound Design, and Mixing: https://aaronfeeneymusic.com/\nSocial Media: Sarah Bader\nGraphic Design: Anonymous Survivors\n\nSURVIVORS - THANK YOU, AND MAY YOU BE HEARD.",

Most were known by their rhetorical power, calvinistic soteriology, and movement-building prowess. But they\u0027ve all got a spiritual father, a Patriarch, if you will.\n\nMaybe you listened to the 2021 podcast series \u0022The Rise and Fall of Mars Hill,\u0022 and wondered, \u0022Where did Driscoll come from?\u0022 Well, he took what Doug Wilson had written, and preached it. Driscoll appealed to men like never before, with an in-your-face message, that beat you up and left you satisfied, longing for more. Many others have followed in his wake, but like all modern philosophers to Plato, they\u0027re simply building on Wilson.\n\n Listen in as we talk with Nick Gier, Professor Emeritus at the University of Idaho (Doug\u0027s former professor), and Russell Moore, Editor in Chief at Christianity Today, about Doug\u0027s beginnings, those whom he\u0027s influenced, and where they see this going.\n\n \nSons of Patriarchy is brought to you by:\nProducer, Writer, Editor, and Host: Peter Bell\nOriginal Music, Sound Design, and Mixing: https://aaronfeeneymusic.com/\nSocial Media: Sarah Bader\nGraphic Design: Anonymous Survivors\n\n SURVIVORS - THANK YOU, AND MAY YOU BE HEARD.",

      "description": "Introducing Mark Hyman: Struggling With Brain Fog, Weight Gain, and Low Energy? It\u2019s Likely Hidden Inflammation! (Do THIS to Reverse It) from On Purpose with Jay Shetty. Follow the show: On Purpose with Jay Shetty Do you struggle to focus on simple tasks? Do you feel mentally \u201Cslowed down\u201D during the day? Today, Jay welcomes back his dear friend and trailblazer in functional medicine, Dr. Mark Hyman. Mark Hyman, MD is the co-founder and Chief Medical Officer of Function Health, the fastest growing health company in the U.S. In this extremely vulnerable conversation, Mark recounts his near-death experience after a severe spinal infection left him unable to walk and fighting for his life. Despite decades of living and teaching optimal health, he suddenly found himself dependent on others for even the simplest tasks. Over the course of five determined months, Mark applied the very principles he has championed for years: nutritional excellence, disciplined daily movement, and an unshakable mindset. Not only did he make a full recovery, but came back stronger than ever at the age of 65, proving that the body\u2019s innate healing capacity can be reignited at any stage of life. The conversation explores the critical role mindset plays in recovery and underscores the often-overlooked connection between diet, lifestyle, and overall well-being. Mark explains how chronic illness is frequently driven by hidden inflammation, fueled by ultra-processed foods, sugar, and environmental toxins. He breaks down the science behind his 10-Day Detox, a simple yet powerful reset proven to dramatically reduce symptoms such as fatigue, pain, and digestive distress. The discussion also delves into the growing prevalence of autoimmune conditions, the hidden epidemic of nutrient deficiencies, and why personalized health data is essential for identifying risks before they become life-threatening. In this interview, you\u0027ll learn: How to Rebuild Your Health After a Major Setback How to Use Mindset as Your Greatest Healing Tool How to Reduce Inflammation Through Diet How to Spot the Early Signs of Autoimmune Disease How to Use Food as Medicine Every Day How to Take Small Daily Steps Toward Lifelong Wellness Healing isn\u2019t instant, but each intentional choice, a nourishing meal, a mindful moment, a restful night, builds momentum toward changes far greater than expected.

      "description": "In this last episode of Season 1, I spoke with Dr. Karen Roudkovski, a Licensed Professional Counselor with her own practice, and an expert on trauma and abuse, with her own story of the same.\n\nKaren ties in every theme of Sons of Patriarchy Season 1, gives language to those searching and hurting, a listening ear to those who want to speak out, and the compassion to speak into those lives who have been destroyed by leaders of the church.\n\nMay the end of Season 1 give you hope, peace, understanding, and the courage to move forward in the grace of the Savior.\n\nBecause Jesus himself understands what you went through, are going through, and will go through.

So we look into when women \u0022win,\u0022 what that means for their relationship with the church and its leadership, as well as their marriages (or former marriages). Megan (and her family) were horrifically abused by her ex-husband, and you\u0027ll hear what kind of counsel came from the mouth of Jim, which then starts making more sense of Doug.

Sex becomes a conquering act, not the beautiful union of a man and a woman who love one another. Women are receptacles for the pleasure of men, marriage a plan for taking over the world, and spanking kids the key to obedience and warriors in the quiver of the father. Mothers required only because they\u2019re needed for the birth, not because they contribute anything, but because men can\u2019t do it on their own.\n\nSex is beautiful, families are beautiful, and children are beautiful. But none of these are ultimate. All of these are wonderful blessings of God. But none are tools for our gain.\n\nThe Savior came not to be served, but to serve, and give his life a ransom for many.

The virtuous woman *only* stays at home, homeschools her children, satisfies her husband, and makes sure there\u0027s no ugliness in her. They are to stay silent, unless, of course, they\u0027ve been approved to teacher other women to... stay silent. You can speak, as long as you tell other women not to.\n\nAt the same time women are more liable to deceit than their male counterparts they also hold the power to cause their brothers to stumble. It\u0027s a whiplash, a system wherein you\u0027re told to be feminine, but not too feminine, smart, but not too smart, put together, but not independent.\n\nIn summary, it\u0027s impossible.

Figure out where this thing called Christian Nationalism came from.\nCatholic Integralism is both intellectually superior of, and far more historically grounded counterpart to Christian Nationalism. Kevin Vallier (Professor of Philosophy at the University of Toledo) discusses the rise of Catholic Integralism, the Protestant response, and where Christian Nationalism fits into that picture (if it does at all).\nFrom Catholic Integralism, we move forward a few hundred hears to the founding of the American Republic. Jerome Copulsky (Research Fellow at the Berkley Center at Georgetown University) analyzes the political and religious traditions of the 18th and 19th centuries, dispelling rumors about America\u0027s founding while providing a politically (and religiously) robust reading of the nation\u0027s constitution and supporting documents.\nAll the Kingdoms of the World by Kevin Vallier\nAmerican Heretics by Jerome Copulsky\n\u00A0\nDonate to help the survivor network here.\nJoin: Private Survivor Support Group.\nSign up for our Patreon here.\nVisit sonsofpatriarchy.com to find resources, recommended reading, and more.\nSocial Media: Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, and TikTok.\nExamining Doug Wilson and Moscow: Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook\n\u00A0\n\u0022Sons of Patriarchy\u0022 is brought to you by\nProducer, Writer, Editor, and Host: Peter Bell\nOriginal Music, Sound Design, and Mixing: https://aaronfeeneymusic.com/\nSocial Media: Sarah Bader\nGraphic Design: Anonymous Survivors\nSURVIVORS - THANK YOU, AND MAY YOU BE HEARD.",

Most were known by their rhetorical power, calvinistic soteriology, and movement-building prowess.

Driscoll appealed to men like never before, with an in-your-face message, that beat you up and left you satisfied, longing for more. Many others have followed in his wake, but like all modern philosophers to Plato, they\u0027re simply building on Wilson.\nListen in as we talk with Nick Gier, Professor Emeritus at the University of Idaho (Doug\u0027s former professor), and Russell Moore, Editor in Chief at Christianity Today, about Doug\u0027s beginnings, those whom he\u0027s influenced, and where they see this going.\n\u00A0\n\u0022Sons of Patriarchy\u0022 is brought to you by\nProducer, Writer, Editor, and Host: Peter Bell\nOriginal Music, Sound Design, and Mixing: https://aaronfeeneymusic.com/\nSocial Media: Sarah Bader\nGraphic Design: Anonymous Survivors\nSURVIVORS - THANK YOU, AND MAY YOU BE HEARD.",

One thing is for sure, they\u0027re influential. What started in the late 70s has blossomed into a worldwide movement, making Christian Nationalism... national. From a small college town, Moscow, Idaho, meet the pastor and movement that is influencing American politics, and infiltrating American churches.\n\nIn this inaugural episode, Kristin Kobes Du Mez talks about the decades leading up to the rise of Doug Wilson.
