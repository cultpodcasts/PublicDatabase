We hear from three key witnesses whose testimonies began to unravel the web of deceit surrounding the disappearances of JJ Vallow and Tylee Ryan, the children of Lori Vallow Daybell.First, David Warwick recounts the chilling night he last saw JJ Vallow, wearing red pajamas, with Alex Cox.

Finally, an FBI agent reveals the now-infamous text messages between Chad and Tammy Daybell about shooting a raccoon and burying it in the pet cemetery - the same location where JJ and Tylee were later found. The date of the text exchange most likely corresponds with the day that Tylee was murdered.This episode exposes the early cracks in Chad Daybell\u0027s carefully constructed facade.

      "description": "Send us a text Lori Vallow and Chad Daybell fell into a deep and distorted love affair. This was a dangerous and horrible event that led to the demise of Lori\u0027s husband Charles Vallow, Chad\u0027s wife Tammy Douglas Daybell, and Lori\u0027s children Tylee Ryan and JJ Vallow. As we continue to move forward in the timeline of the missing children, we have learned so much about the evil belief system that has convinced Lori Vallow Daybell that her children were evil and needed to be murdered. Chad Daybell came up with a rating system and he sure did convince Lori that she was his Goddess. We explore the timeline leading up to Chad\u0027s \u0022book\u0022 Loin Fire. Chad was still married to Tammy when he shared \u0022Loin Fire\u0022 with Lori. But, Alex Cox had murdered Lori\u0027s husband Charles Vallow 2 days before he shared this with Lori. It might seem fiction based on the characters of James and Elana, but .... if you know the timeline, the people involved, and the evil beliefs they are following you will realize this is actually the true story of Lori (Elana) and Chad (James.)

By early December 2019, many of those investigating the case was becoming very concerned about missing JJ Vallow and Tylee Ryan. No one had heard from the children for several months. Lori Vallow was asking her good friend, fellow LDS confidant, and podcast partner to LIE to law enforcement regarding the whereabouts of 7-year-old JJ Vallow. Lori and Chad were hiding, but still communicating with those they felt close to. Melanie Gibb was growing very uncomfortable and also most likely quite afraid for her own knowledge of the teachings and followings of Chad Daybell and Lori Vallow. The pressure was getting hot! Chad Daybell and Lori Vallow had a phone call from Melanie Gibb. With David Warwick by her side and encouraging her to call them, they recorded the call. A lot is revealed in this call. Lori gets quite uncomfortable and irritated. Thanks for listening to this episode of Afterglow UnVEILING The Idaho Cult. Season 2 Episode 10.

The car was left at Ian Pawlowski\u0027s sister\u0027s home for Colby Ryan to retrieve. Colby was visited by law enforcement on November 27, 2019.

They were clearly worried. After all the lies and deception they ran off. However, once Law Enforcement realized that Colby had this Nissan Rogue, they determined that this could be EVIDENCE! They impounded the car and they found exactly what they thought they might find! EVIDENCE! Blood! Blood stains in the back seat of the vehicle.

She and Alex Cox were convinced that Lori Vallow and Chad Daybell were the chosen 144,000 from the book of revelations. Melani left her husband Brandon Boudreaux and their 4 children to move to Rexburg Idaho to be with Lori Vallow, Chad Daybell, and Alex Cox. Uncle Alex Cox allegedly shot Melani\u0027s husband Brandon Boudreaux on Oct 2, 2019. Thankfully Alex missed. Brandon was extremely concerned about his 4 children and took them to his parent\u0027s home in American Fork Utah. For some reason, while Lori and Chad were in Kauai, Hawaii getting married and planning everything, all while JJ Vallow and Tylee Ryan were missing, Melani decided she needed to desperately see her children, or take them. Were they on the list to be the next victims of Chad and Aunt Lori? Alex Cox helps his niece Melani go to her ex-inlaws home and try to \u0022see her children.

We also hear from Lori\u0027s landlord when he was interviewed by phone by Chandler police detective Moffett. And to top it all off Chad Daybell calls a funeral home in Chandler to ask about prices for her deceased uncle that will need to be transported to Lousinanna. It\u0027s insanity!

Alex Cox and Tylee Ryan were interviewed at the Chandler Police Department on July 11, 2019. Detective Moffet interviews Alex and points out that his and Lori\u0027s story isn\u0027t adding up. Detective Moffet becomes a key player in the Vallow Daybell story as we move forward. At this point, Kay and Larry are surprised, upset, and confused. Tylee is really sticking to her mom\u0027s story and what we eventually learn is this is just such a horrible decision. But, what is a 16-year-old girl going to do? Thanks for listening.
