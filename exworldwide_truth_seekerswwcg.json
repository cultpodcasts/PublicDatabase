But after you listen to this - I bet you\u0027ll clearly see the \u0022other side\u0022 of this teaching as even Jesus spells it out.  Why were we so blind to this?  How could our parents not have seen it.  I guess the only answer is that they want to feel safe  as their is safety in keep a set of laws that will get you into the God\u0027s good graces and the kingdom.  Abraham\u0027s kind of faith?  Forget that.  Too much work - too much unknown.  So, our minds can become blind and cannot see until we turn to God finally - who removes our blinders.  Amazing.  but I\u0027ve laid it all out here.

Well Dan and Angela show the mechanics of how to make your faith work for you using real examples from their own lives.  They share how we have to first change our belief system programmed into us, how they managed to do that themselves and how it will work for you too  - if the same steps are followed (changing your mind).  This is well mapped out with scriptures that you may have never seen before.  We were taught to not want for anything more than \u0022sustenance and covering\u0022 and to feel guilty if we do (want more for ourselves).  Well, the scriptures prove that God clearly does want more for us and that all of these promises (and God\u0027s wishes for us) are clearly spelled out.

      "description": "Accept that YOU Matter - Yes You Matter!  As children - we all should have been cared for, nurtured, loved unconditionally and been treated with respect,  feeling validated, listened to and heard. Not living in this healthy household will cause havoc on our personal opinion of ourselves - affecting our life now!  \nWhen you come to believe and face the truth about who you \u0022really\u0022 are and not the piece of sh...t that you have always believed you are; forever wondering why you were made to be that way - less than perfect - things will begin to change rapidly in your life.  First comes the awareness of the dysfunctional tactics used in your family of origin and/or church, etc., like parents not respecting your boundaries, your feelings, being gaslighted, siblings being pitted against each other and one being favored more than another causing hatred, jealousy, competition; being loved conditionally and only when you obey and perform and NOT if you don\u0027t, etc. If this is not looked at and faced, then it becomes the definition of insanity:  doing the same thing the same way over and over and expecting to get a different result.  \nI (Angela) got out of my second cult when I was nearly dead.  I asked for help from a God a thought hated me, and quickly found help.  That help lead me to the information we are sharing with you today.  It wasn\u0027t easy to face, but with support of a few new people that were brought into my life at that time and a few classes and two powerful books - my life began to change quickly.  I was married within a year and I have never looked back and continue to change to this day as we all should really, until we pass on.\n\nVideo Provided by:  Dan and Angela Clark\nWebsite: www.prodigaljourneys.com - Dan\u0027s\nWebsite: www.angelasinspirations@gmail.com\nGroup: The Matrix of Abundance\nFacebook:  Life After Religion\nFacebook: Truth Beyond the Veil\nFacebook: Ex-Worldwide Truth Seekers\n\nJOIN US EVERY SUNDAY AT 10:00AM\nZOOM/PODCAST - SUNDAY MORNINGS - PROGRAM:  \u0022Spiritual Discoveries\u0022 with Dan \u0026 Angela Clark\n10:00am MST.\nZOOM/PODCAST LINK: https://us06web.zoom.us/j/87175205956?pwd=ncbaqL3elb08av5U5n5FXZ9QyJpHpJ.1\n\nMeeting ID: 871 7520 5956\nPasscode: 777992\nDonations Welcome:  Link:  https://paypal.me/CoachMe777?country.x=US\u0026locale.x=en_US",

      "description": "Since Leaving WWCOG - Melina Oine made a hard decision, when it was almost too late to do it that she would GO BACK TO SCHOOL (College) and BECOME A HEALTH ADVOCATE!  None of it made any sense at the time considering her circumstances, her upbringing and especially WWCOG ability to keep woman from becoming much of anything but a homemaker.  She put one foot in front of the other doubting herself much of the time - but with much love and support - she GRADUATED with a MASTERS Degree in Health Advocacy a week ago!\nCongratulations Melina and congratulations for overcoming the programming about how woman are not meant to succeed - let alone men for fear that this is worldly!  What do you think about this?  Do we need to experience success and a sense of accomplishment and the building of a certain sense of self with a bit of self-esteem to keep you confident and strong?  We say YES!  Armstrong used this tool to keep us all under his thumb of control along with his Leaders and Ministers.\n\nAbout Melina Oine. Melina was born and raised in the WWCOG. Her family officially got out in the mid 90;s shortly after Tkach Jr. took on the mantle when Melina  was 17.  Melina actually almost completely stopped attending around the age of 15-16.  In her earlier years, Melina attended services in Anchorage Alaska until about 1985. At that point, her family moved to Honolulu, Hawaii where Melina lived until she was married at age 18 to a Navy  Marine.  They had 3 children together  About 12 years later, her  daughter was diagnosed with a life threatening disease which landed her in and out of emergency rooms and hospitals and soon after, Melina herself was diagnosed with an auto-immune condition that she was now also dealing with at the same time and started therapy.   That pushed her to look at her past and current traumas.  She discovered that the conditioning from childhood had predisposed her to being involved in a dysfunctional and traumatic  marriage and learning this, she was eventually at a point where she was able to leave the marriage.  \n\nMelina recently moved to South-East Washington state where she now lives with her daughter and where she also has recently become board certified (BCPA) as an Independent Patient Advocate and now has just received her Masters in Health Advocacy!\n\nAngela Clark is NOW OFFERING:  Empower Her Life Coach - helping woman find their authentic expression and freedom by getting their voices; To Do More, Be More and Have More - Hope, Friends...\nTO SCHEDULE A SESSION:  Email Angela:  angelasinspirations@gmail.com  \nWebsite https://www.AngelasInspirations.com (under construction) but can schedule your appointment here soon.\nDan Clark is an Intuitive Breakthrough Coach\nTO SCHEDULE A SESSION:  Email Dan at myprodigaljourney@gmail.com\nhttps://www.ProdigalJourneys.com\n\nJOIN US EVERY SUNDAY AT 10:00AM\nZOOM/PODCAST - SUNDAY MORNINGS - PROGRAM:  \u0022Spiritual Discoveries\u0022 with Dan \u0026 Angela Clark\n10:00am MST.\nZOOM/PODCAST LINK:\nhttps://us06web.zoom.us/j/84007457250?pwd=bDanz7RsA2fAoUJ4qvpCyXbwz52Z9V.1\n\nMeeting ID: 840 0745 7250\nPasscode: 288119\n\nDonations Welcome:  Link:  https://paypal.me/CoachMe777?country.x=US\u0026locale.x=en_US",

We need to change our mind about this so we can function in this world in a way that supports what we are here on earth to do - not just waiting for it to end.  We see everyone as separate from us.  We have to learn to love our neighbor as we love ourselves which IS loving ourselves.  Dr. David R. Hawkins teaches about what happens when our thoughts and vibrations (negative or positive) affects our body, our health and our feeling that life is good or not good.  So we want to strive to be in the flow with God type thoughts - Joy, hopeful, optimistic, peace, harmony, etc.  \n\nWebsite:  https://www.AngelasInspirations.com\nEmail:  exworldwidetruthseekers@gmail.com\n\nTO SCHEDULE A COACHING SESSION:  Email Angela:  angelasinspirations@gmail.com  \nWebsite https://www.AngelasInspirations.com (under construction) but can schedule your appointment here soon.\n\nCheck This Out:  ZOOM/PODCAST - SUNDAY MORNINGS - PROGRAM:  \u0022Spiritual Discoveries\u0022 with Dan \u0026 Angela Clark\n10:00am MST.\nZOOM/PODCAST LINK: https://us06web.zoom.us/j/87175205956...\nMeeting ID: 871 7520 5956\nPasscode: 777992\n\nDONATIONS Welcome:  Link:  https://paypal.me/CoachMe777?country....",

      "description": "Angela and Dan Clark discuss how men have not been in their hearts due to long time ancestral programming being told that they are never to show emotion, never to cryand woman have received the same wounding but to the sacral area (abdomen) which we need to acknowledge so that healing can begin.  Men need to be able to open their hearts again and not be afraid to be emotional, cry, be sensitive. Women have been told to not be strong, courageous or bold - but encouraged to be weak with no voice but check out the Proverbs 31 woman. She wasn\u0027t at all weak or quiet!.  Both need to come to the middle so that we are balanced.

In fact - children were to be seen and not heard and were valueless as well as women.  But we can overcome this and take back the control of not only our emotions but our very lives and find some real freedom, learning how to be authentic and easily deal with the dysfunction.  But first, we have to see the dysfunctional in our families for what it is.  We have to overcome the abuse and call it what it was.",
