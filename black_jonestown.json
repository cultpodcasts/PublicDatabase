      "description": "In Episode 3 of Black Jonestown, we sit down with Janet Shuler, the oldest surviving member of Peoples Temple, as she shares her journey in her own words.\n\nAn educated, accomplished professional in early childhood education, Janet joined Peoples Temple believing it was a place where her gifts could serve children and build community. And for a time, it was. But as the cracks began to show, Janet realized Jim Jones was not the man he claimed to be. What followed was a quiet awakening \u2014 and a carefully planned escape that saved her life and the lives of her family. This episode challenges the long-standing stereotypes about who followed Jim Jones. Janet Shuler was not ignorant or helpless. She was thoughtful, perceptive, and courageous \u2014 a woman who chose truth over fear.\n\nWe also honor the life and legacy of Deanna Wilkinson, one of Peoples Temple\u2019s most extraordinary voices. Her music brought joy to many, and her story reminds us that behind every headline were real people with real gifts and real lives.\n\nEpisode 3 premieres December 17th.\nStay tuned.",
