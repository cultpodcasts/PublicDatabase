      "description": "Send us a text In this powerful episode, we sit down with a 4th-generation former Jehovah\u0027s Witness who shares her deeply personal journey of faith, family, and awakening. From pioneering with her husband across multiple language congregations and dreaming of Gilead, to witnessing the heartbreaking realities of shunning and child abuse within the organization, she opens up about the emotional toll of living a life dedicated to the faith. She recounts the harrowing experience of her grandfather\u0027s near-death due to the \u0027No-blood\u0027 policy, the tragic shunning and suicide attempts of her aunt, and the recent abduction of her mother by zealous JW relatives. Her story is a testament to resilience and the painful but liberating process of waking up to the truth. Now, as an active member of the Stop Mandated Shunning team and a participant in significant research and legal efforts, she\u2019s fighting to expose the harmful practices of the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses and support others on their journey out. Tune in to hear her discuss her participation in the ICSA Conference, the groundbreaking Roehampton University Research project, and how the power of storytelling is driving legal and academic progress worldwide. Don\u0027t miss this candid conversation that shines a light on the unseen struggles and victories of those who have left high-control religions.

      "description": "In this video JT focuses on his personal experience with the the financial aspects of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses\u0027 circuit assemblies and regional conventions. JT also discusses the lack of transparency in the organization\u0027s financial dealings, particularly at higher levels. Key Points: 1. **Always in the Red**: JT mentions that circuit assemblies always seem to be running a deficit, something he questioned even as a child. He didn\u0027t understand why until he became an elder and was responsible for circuit assembly accounts. 2. **Per Publisher Rate**: The organization charges a \u0022per publisher rate\u0022 for every circuit assembly, guaranteeing a certain amount of money will be generated. For example, if the rate is $10 per publisher and there are 1,000 publishers, the assembly starts $10,000 in the red. 3. **Lack of Transparency**: While local Kingdom Halls and circuit assemblies provide detailed accounts of their finances, this transparency is not extended to district or regional conventions. The organization has never disclosed how much money is collected at these larger events. 4. **Accounting Practices**: At the local level, two people are required to count and sign off on the money collected, adhering to good accounting practices. However, this level of scrutiny is not applied at higher organizational levels. 5. **Money Makers**: JT points out that these assemblies and conventions are significant moneymakers for the organization. Despite this, there\u0027s no clear accounting provided to the general membership about where this money goes or how it\u0027s used. 6. **Personal Experience**: JT shares anecdotes from his time as an elder, including the pressure to meet financial targets and the lack of questioning among the elders about keeping some money in the account for future needs. 7. **Change in Policy**: Due to instances of \u0022borrowing\u0022 (essentially stealing), the organization changed its policy to require two people to count and sign off on any money collected, even at the smaller book study level. The video aims to encourage critical thinking about the financial aspects of being a Jehovah\u0027s Witness, questioning the lack of transparency and accountability in the organization\u0027s handling of funds.

As a former Jehovah\u0027s Witness, Lucille faced an incredibly challenging situation but demonstrated unwavering determination to protect the innocent and advocate for justice. With immense courage, Lucille first contacted Child Protective Services, knowing the gravity of her responsibility in safeguarding the vulnerable child involved. Recognizing the urgency of the situation, she sought professional intervention to ensure the safety and well-being of the young victim. Additionally, Lucille also felt compelled to address the matter and decided to approach the Elders at the local Kingdom Hall to raise awareness and demand appropriate action. This decision was a significant step in holding those responsible accountable and reinforcing the importance of protecting children within the congregation. Furthermore, Lucille\u0027s journey did not end there. She realized the necessity of reporting the incident to the higher authorities within the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses organization. Understanding the significance of collective efforts in combating such issues, she reached out to The Watchtower Bible \u0026 Tract Society, seeking transparency, accountability, and changes to prevent future occurrences. Lucille\u0027s experience serves as an inspiring example of how individuals can take proactive measures to protect children from the horrors of abuse, even within complex institutional structures. Her unwavering commitment to justice and child protection resonates as a beacon of hope and encouragement for others who may find themselves in similar circumstances.

Unfortunately, the advice given by the elders in the congregation left him feeling helpless and hopeless when they begin encouraging him to regular pioneer. After taking the advice of the elders, Ryan chose to regular pioneer but quickly realized that he was unable to pay his bills. He was just struggling to survive. Fortunately, Ryan woke up and began to reexamine his situation. Perhaps you have had a similar experience where you gave up dreams, goals and aspirations to please the brothers in your local congregation. This happens all too many times where young people make decisions that drastically affect their ability to take care of their material needs much later in life.

      "description": "This podcast starts out reading a list of individuals and the podcaster then asks the pointed question: so now what do all of these people have in common? That\u0027s right they are celebrity Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses. And now we have Serena Williams! For many years people ask the question is Serena Williams one of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses because at the end of each game she would often make the statement \u0022I have to thank Jehovah God\u0022, so people would ask the question, is she one of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses? And today, we have the answer. She\u0027s a dedicated baptized Jehovah\u0027s Witness. You know there are people who will often look and say I can\u0027t believe that she became a Jehovah\u0027s Witness. Well, it\u0027s important to keep in mind what it\u0027s like to be raised as one of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses. All your life you\u0027re told whenever you have a problem, whenever things are going bad in your life, whenever you get yourself together, return to Jehovah. And today, Serena Williams has retired from her career. She\u0027s married she has a child, and it often causes people to reflect differently on their lives. One of the things that we know that she probably didn\u0027t do, is take the time to do the research that we encourage everybody to do. We have found that many people leave the Jehovah\u2019s Witness organization and will be gone for years and sometimes decades. They fail to take the time to ask critical thinking questions about what they learned about this religion. Instead, they simply come right back to the religion without asking questions without doing their own personal research. As a result, there are so many things that they fail to understand about the religion that impacted their life in every aspect of it. You know there\u2019s something interesting that happens for people who are celebrity Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses things that a regular Jehovah\u0027s Witness if they were to do would get them in a lot of trouble well as a celebrity witness is often overlooked.

Because the Witnesses believe that the world is soon to end, there is no need to spend any time pursuing a career in endless pursuits. Instead, they believe that trying to convert others to learn the truth as outlined by their religion is what God wants them to do. You will learn how the Watchtower leadership misappropriates the term career by insinuating that if their members take up the task of cart witnessing, it somehow equates into a meaningful career choice. https://www.npr.org/2017/02/19/510585965/poor-education-leads-to-lost-dreams-and-low-income-for-many-jehovahs-witnesses Please consider supporting our work on Patreon - https://www.patreon.com/exjwcriticalthinker Check out our videos on why we left the Why We Left the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses https://youtu.be/rqYUCV4FHI4 https://youtu.be/bLaSB9P2MEE Visit us on the Web at http://www.exjwcriticalthinker.com Support the show",

And then one of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses calling from house to house managed to start a Bible study with him. After eight months, the man needed no more pills, and four months later he was pronounced fully cured. 00;01;00;18 - 00;01;39;00 Then there was the woman in Michigan who for many years had received regular psychotherapy shock treatments and had spent $5,000 on drug treatment. Yet she still kept threatening suicide. After studying the Bible with Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, she was able to discontinue taking drugs as well as quit smoking. She found her psychiatrist to tell him that now she felt better than she had ever felt before, and what accounted for it? He replied that he wished all of his patients could find a cure like that. 00;01;46;04 - 00;02;23;16 The two experiences that you just heard, they came from the April 22nd, 1975, a week magazine. These types of articles form the foundation and the basis for the type of culture that exists among Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses. For decades, and that is people who are struggling with mental health issues. It is because you are spiritually weak. And so by citing examples of someone who had an incurable situation in their life with schizophrenia, that by reading our magazines they were cured. These types of articles were used by elders, circuit overseers and speakers all around the world to tell the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses just read our magazines and your problems will be fixed. 00;02;38;28 - 00;03;07;19 Hi, this is Lady Cee. Welcome to the critical thought. In the upcoming episode, we\u0027re going to be talking about Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses and mental health awareness. In fact, we have a series of videos that we\u0027re going to be covering under this umbrella, talking about mental health awareness, because a lot of people, they may be experiencing these issues in their lives, but they don\u0027t realize it. And we also teamed up with a mental health professional who is going to weigh in on this matter. 00;03;17;03 - 00;03;40;25 There is still a stigma when it comes to mental health. Individuals perceive mental health as, you know, that something is wrong with me. You know, I\u0027m flawed. Know there\u0027s a deficit. I think we are addressing that stigma by taking more of a strength based approach to addressing mental health. Not what\u0027s wrong with you, but what\u0027s right about you. Maybe. Maybe we\u0027ve forgotten what was right about me. Through whatever circumstances. Of situations that. I\u0027ve I\u0027ve gone into in my life. In the mind is interesting. We can get so focused on that algorithm of negativity, too, where we only see what we believe and then. 00;04;11;07 - 00;04;23;06 Hi, I\u0027m Daniel. I am JT and the purpose of this video is to speak to you about how the Watchtower creates mental health issues for its members. Okay, JT, let\u0027s start. 00;04;23;09 - 00;04;32;11 Speaker 2 Yeah, that is something that you will find in this religion is the mental health concerns that people will end up finding themselves dealing with. 00;04;33;00 - 00;04;52;06 Speaker 3 Mm hmm. Well, a few weeks ago, we released a video, and we made the point that the Watchtower, the governing body, the witnesses and the society as a whole basically were the modern day Pharisees, but they were the modern day Pharisees because they were creating manmade mandates.

In this podcast, we discuss the situation with Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses and how our guest, Shauna, was faced with this dilemma. Find out how she and her family handled their situation in this podcast. ********************* Begin Email message from anesthesiologist: Hello. I found you guys on the Internet. I\u2019m a[n] anesthesiologist. I have a question for you. What percentage of those witnesses would take a blood transfusion if it could be absolutely guaranteed where no one will ever find out? I have had several patients that in the operating room, I asked them before going to sleep if they would receive blood. They have said \u2018no blood\u2019 in the presence of family in the preoperative area. However when alone in the operating room with no family members around, they have said that they will, in fact, accept blood in the operating room as long as nobody finds out. This has happened a number of times. A recent case where a woman that I had as a patient almost died until we got her to the operating room and were able to give her blood anonymously. We\u2019re trying to develop a policy in the hospital somehow to be able to give JWs the option of a truly free decision on whether or not they want to receive blood without the pressure of being in the presence of family and church vampires about. Any of your thoughts are greatly appreciated.

      "description": "If you know the history behind the Jehovah\u0027s Witness religion, you are well aware of how it feels being at odds with the beliefs once you realize it is not the truth. Many JW\u0027s are in a quandary where they have to fake it just to survive. That is what being a PIMO is all about. It is an acronym for Physically In, Mentally Out. To further explain, it\u0027s all about pretending to believe so that you don\u0027t lose your family and social structure. The term PIMO was coined several years ago to identify the growing number of individuals that are trapped in the religion for one reason or another. Because of the strict shunning policy, Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses realize they can lose everything if they allow others to know how they truly feel about the organization. They stand to lose their marriage, job, friends, home, and anything else that connects them to a person that holds the cards to any situation as it relates to their livelihood. This podcast delves into the lives of members at the world headquarters of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses aka Bethel. During the COVID-19 lockdown, members at Bethel experienced a very turbulent time as they were not permitted to leave the premises. They report alcohol abuse, domestic violence, depression and even suicidal thoughts.

      "description": "#exjw #JehovahWitness #exjwcriticalthinker You\u0027ve no doubt heard of the term PIMO which means Physically In, Mentally Out. This is how Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses that are trapped in the religion but no longer believe it is the truth but they remain in the congregation because they do not want to lose their family. Justin\u0027s PIMO story is much more than that because he was literally in survival mode while pretending to be a Jehovah\u0027s Witness. His entire livelihood was in danger if the brothers at the Kingdom Hall really knew how he felt about the Watchtower, Bible \u0026 Tract Society. In fact, he was facing the possibility of losing his job because not only the owner of the company, but approximately 80% of the staff were all Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses. Therefore, if Justin were to leave the religion, he may as well be quitting his job too. It is interesting how Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses may seem to feel slighted because people do not want to deal with them and their religious beliefs. Yet, when it is convenient for them, they turn around and treat people the exact same way for choosing to leave their group.

      "description": "How to Reach VEVIAN VOZMEDIANO Facebook Instagram YouTube Website ABOUT VEVIAN Learning how to live after leaving or getting disfellowshipped from the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses is a challenging journey. It destroys your whole approach to life. It\u0027s like the rug gets pulled out from under you in every way because the organization defined everything about your life. It defined who you were, what you believed in, your relationships, your purpose in life, your view of the world, your view of the future, and your view on what happened to us after we die. Being part of it is how you made sense of the world. As a Jehovah\u0027s Witness, you were taught to be \u0022no part of this world.\u0022 The religion made you believe that it was only \u0022Jehovah\u0027s people\u0022 who had \u0022the truth\u0022. I\u0027m here to tell you otherwise. When Jesus said, \u0022the truth will set you free,\u0022 he was speaking of your OWN truth. Living your truth means that you unapologetically embrace who you are and present that true self to the world. Your authentic self is the self that will most benefit you and the lives of those you encounter. Leaving or getting shunned from the organization and not having your voice as a woman can leave you feeling psychologically and mentally stunted and incapable of making life decisions. You could be feeling helpless, suicidal, numb, riddled with guilt and shame, angry, suffer from sleep deprivation, eating disorders, substance abuse, anxiety, depression, and interpersonal dysfunction. It is heroic of you to say NO to the organization and no longer want to be part of it. Possibly for the first time in your life, you are starting to ask yourself, what do I want and believe? Welcome to your healing journey and finding your truth. In a very real way, you have to re-create your identity from scratch. I know what what this feels like. I was disfellowshipped in December 2011. I wrote four letters to get back into the organization in 2 years. I missed everyone, including my mom, who has been a regular pioneer for 30\u0026#43; years. After these two years of getting rejected re-entry, I decided I wanted to see what life was like in the real world. It turns out it\u0027s pretty INCREDIBLE! I\u0027ve dedicated the last ten years of my life to my healing journey of finding my own truth. This journey of self-awareness, self-inquiry, self-acceptance and self-compassion led me to the path of self-love. It turns out, the only person you need approval from is yourself! Along my healing path, I\u0027ve picked up tools, habits, and tactics that I\u0027m sharing in this program. This program is intended to help support you and help you discover who you are outside of the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses. The group format and setting will provide a safe space to connect with like-minded individuals who will intern empower you on your journey. During these eight weeks, you will take a deep dive into your inner world to unlock what you believe, who you are, and help you connect with your full potential!

      "description": "You can visit Amira aka Tuffryda at the link below: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCROI7_fBzYBC4wmJZS3Cs6Q In this episode, Amira discusses what it was like growing up as one of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses and the difficulties she faced in school. Neither one of her parents were baptized as Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, but Amira\u0027s mother was born and raised in the religion. Her mother, a person that didn\u0027t accept the religion as her own, allowed her mother to instill the beliefs in her daughter. Amira tells her story about what it was like navigating her educational pursuits and the difficulties she faced trying to decide whether or not she should attend college. Mainly, because her Jehovah\u0027s Witness family didn\u0027t encourage higher education, but her academic advisors were telling her to move forward with her interests in learning. Of course, no one talks about how much it costs to go to a four year university. So, in this episode, Amira helps other young people her age to understand the difficulties she faced and hopes to steer you in a better direction.

      "description": "#exjw #JehovahWitness #exjwcriticalthinker #Jehovah\u0027sWitnessRelationships This episode will be one of many in a series educating the public about Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses and relationships. The information contained herein is from our perspective and what we have seen. Trust and believe, there are many more sides to this coin. It is just one of many that we will be presenting to the audience to see how Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses think and view relationships. The religion simply makes relationships more difficult because it sets up false titles and positions that people want to attain and when they do not materialize, it can wreak havoc in the lives of its members. We regularly receive email\u0027s from individuals asking us for our advice about pursuing relationships with Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses. There are many different combinations of issues pertaining to these relationships. Some are married to disfellowshipped Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses and didn\u0027t realize it until their significant other decided to return to the Kingdom Hall. Others met the Witness on the job and began seriously dating all to find out that the person wanted them to join the group or else they would have to terminate their relationship. We realize that in order to help educate individuals about being married to a Jehovah\u0027s Witness, it would be best for them to see what it is like when both parties are baptized in the faith. Once you see how stressful it can be for two people that are both willing participants in the religion and the issues they face, it makes it easier to help unbelievers to see the possible difficulties they will face. In this video, we discuss the basics about how Jehovah\u0027s Witness women are pressured to marry individuals that are ministerial servants. We also provide experiences of several individuals that realize their past mistakes about getting married too young.

Over the course of time he served as a ministerial servant, engaged in regular and auxiliary pioneer service. According to Sean, the waking up process was rough and so is the subsequent fallout. However, he confidently states that \u201CIt\u0027s totally worth it, but man, it\u0027s brutal. Sean was raised in a progressive Jehovah\u2019s Witness household where he remembers his father climbing the Jehovah\u2019s Witness corporate ladder. Both parents were regular pioneers (and his mom remains one today). Throughout the years, his parents have sacrificed a lot for the organization. Sean\u2019s dad was the regional convention and circuit assembly overseer and has now been moved into a position where he is being used to train other brothers to do the same thing. He also did a lot of work on Kingdom Hall quick builds and Assembly Hall builds, and has done work with the LDC, RBC, and HLC. He recalls meeting a lot of \u0022heavy hitters\u0022 in the organization. He grew up constantly going to dinners and family vacations with district overseers, circuit overseers, branch representatives, bethel speakers, missionaries, and even went to dinner with a Governing Body member. (Or at least he thinks he was, but at such a young age he was not impressed. Sean\u2019s family hobnobbed with the elite Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, and he got to see a LOT of the behind-the-scenes stuff that goes on at regional conventions and on local congregation levels. Looking back, he believes this was the start of his waking up process although he didn\u2019t realize it at the time.

      "description": "Radio Personality Keil Lamont is no stranger to Detroit\u2019s airwaves. He enjoys an extensively rich and varied radio broadcasting career, working on air in nearly every conceivable radio format, including Classic Hits, News, News/Talk, CHR, Urban, Urban Adult, Jazz and more. Keil started his radio career while yet a sophomore in high school, landing a job at WCAR News Radio 1130 AM and CAR-92, WCAR-FM. As a high school senior, he joined urban outlet WGPR-FM and later moved to WLBS-FM. Through the years, Keil\u2019s radio path has taken him to WDRQ, WKSG, WJZZ, WJLB, and WMXD. Keil hosted the \u201CQuiet Storm\u201D on three separate Detroit radio stations through the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, taking each station to #1 in the key Adult 25-54 demographic. \u201CI am extremely excited to be part of the WJZDRadio team,\u201D says Keil. \u201CWe have the opportunity to showcase Detroit radio\u2019s unique style to a worldwide audience.\u201D You can hear Keil Lamont on WJZDRadio weekdays from 2PM \u2013 6PM Eastern Time.Keil Lamont was raised as one of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses. As you will see from his personal interview, he had many challenges prior to being on the airwaves which had a lot to do with his upbringing as one of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses. He recalls having an interest in radio as early as 12 years old. However, he was told by the Elders that this was not a worthwhile pursuit and went on to state this his was mostly associated with worldly behavior. Fortunately, Keil had other plans for his future other than service the Watchtower, Bible \u0026 Tract Society full time. He continued pursuing his goals as you can see from his accomplishments in life.

He discusses how he woke due to the Watchtower\u0027s teaching about the overlapping generation. Jack is good at empowering individuals to use critical thinking when examining the teachings of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses. Jack has been working with the EXJW Empowerment group since its inception. This group is doing a tremendous job in assisting individuals that no longer belong to the organization. cThey have been instrumental in assisting young people to find a place to stay after being put out of their homes because they no longer choose to following the teachings of the Watchtower, Bible \u0026 Tract Society. The EXJW Empowerment group is an excellent resource for former Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses who want to move past challenges, disappointments and hurts, and move towards a brand new fulfilling, happy and empowered life.

      "description": "#exjw #jehovahswitnesselders Announcements and Reminders January 2022 FOR ELDERS Assisting Young Brothers to Make Spiritual Progress: For several years, the Governing Body has emphasized the importance of assisting young brothers to qualify for congregation responsibilities. This continues to be an urgent need. It has been observed that in some congregations, few baptized brothers in their late teens and early 20s are reaching out to serve as pioneers or ministerial servants. In some lands, relatively few young brothers are applying to attend the School for Kingdom Evangelizers, to serve at Bethel or to assist in Kingdom Hall construction and maintenance. On the other hand, qualified younger brothers in some congregations have been held back simply because of their age. (w18.08 pp. 11-12 pars. 15-17) Therefore, the Governing Body requests that all bodies of elders worldwide give priority to helping younger brothers grow in their relationship with Jehovah and qualify for congregation responsibilities. (Phil. 2:20 -22; 1 Tim. 4:12 -15; w75 4/15 pp. 3-13) Elders should regularly discuss spiritual goals with younger brothers. (Ps. 110:3; w21.08 pp. 26-31; sfl chap. 1 par. 6 pt. 4; chap. 8 par. 5) Although relatively young in years, exceptional ministerial servants may already be viewed as spiritually older men and qualify as elders in their mid-, or even early, 20\u2019s. In due course, the Shepherd book will be updated to reflect this direction. ************************************************** Please consider supporting our work on Patreon - https://www.patreon.com/exjwcriticalthinker Check out our videos on why we left the Why We Left the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses https://youtu.be/rqYUCV4FHI4 https://youtu.be/bLaSB9P2MEE Visit us on the Web at http://www.exjwcriticalthinker.com SUBSCRIBE to us on YouTube http://bit.ly/2p9RTSC Subscribe to Our Podcast: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ex-jehovahs-witnesses-critical-thinkers-critical-thought/id967813520 Follow us on: Twitter https://twitter.com/ExJWsThink Instagram https://www.instagram.com/exjwcriticalthinker/ Facebook https://www.facebook.com/Ex-Jehovahs-Witnesses-Critical-Thinkers-529293183758131/ Check out our t-shirt designs: https://exjwcriticalthinker.myspreadshop.com/all How to Contact Us We appreciate hearing from our viewers; however, we do not have enough staff or resources to communicate with everyone.

Listen to their podcast at: Podcast \u2013 https://whatshouldithinkabout.podbean.com Website \u2013 https://www.evilsheep.co.uk/whatshouldithinkabout Stephen Mather was a born-in Jehovah\u0027s Witness that never truly believed all of their teachings. His childhood was spent thinking about Watchtower attainments: Ministerial Servant, Elder, Pioneer, Circuit Overseer, Missionary and Bethelite. However, once he and his wife had their daughter, Stephen realized that he cannot teach someone something that he does not fully believe himself. That was the start of his journey out of Watchtower. BIOS: Celine Rachel Mather is a media graduate of Goldsmiths College, University of London who has been making short films for three years, initially as a writer and now finding a love in directing and producing. She is focused on breaking into the film industry as an independent young female creator. Celine is a partner at Evil Sheep Productions and the Producer and co-creator of Dissonance. Stephen Mather is a Psychology graduate through the Open University with a Masters in Organizational Psychology through Birkbeck University of London. He works as a Learning \u0026 Development professional and improvement coach within business settings. Having left the high control group of his birth he has a particular interest in the psychological processes involved in high control, cultic groups and how leavers construct their identity upon exiting.

      "description": "There are many people that come into contact with Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses at the lowest point in their lives. David is no different. During the time he lost his mother, they were right there selling paradise. He learned all about the resurrection hope, welcoming dead loved ones, living on paradise earth, and all the fun he\u0027d have playing with the tigers, lions, and bears and enjoying the prospects of living forever. The only catch? He had to join their religion. He was quickly love-bombed by the Witnesses at his mother\u0027s funeral and David fell for their fake love - hook-line-and-sinker like so many unsuspecting individuals. At the time David came into contact with the Witnesses, he was still young and impressionable. He was still trying to figure things out, not really sure about what he wanted to do with his life. He was taking classes at the community college and working at the local convenient store. However, after getting further involved with the group, he was discouraged from pursuing higher education. He quickly got with their program and began following their rules. He had no idea that this religion was not just same mainstream organization that attended meetings on Sunday. Nope, it was much more than that. for the next 20\u0026#43; years, David found himself on a mental marry-go-ground jumping through all of the Watchtower\u0027s hoops. Support the show",

Lonnie\u0027s previous interview from 2018 - https://youtu.be/deIwpc8Geko Lonnie Gillard appeared on our show three years ago telling his story about waking up and leaving the Jehovah\u2019s Witness religion. He was still living at home with his parents. As a result, his parents no longer allowed him to remain living in their home. He survived by finding online resources and was able to land a place to live at an Airbnb. Fortunately, Lonnie was able to find support from his non-Jehovah\u2019s Witness family. While most do not live locally, they still took time to provide him with mental and moral support. He expresses how he is most grateful for them calling him to do telephone check ins, something is not receiving from his parents. Fortunately, Lonnie did not have any extreme circumstances, nor did he ever find himself on the street. He always had a place to lay his head at night. He credits his father for his ability to survive because as he states, \u201Cmy father said my job is to make sure that you and your siblings are able to stand on your own two feet\u201D. Now that he\u2019s out in the world, he appreciates his home training. Looking back, he said, he thought he was the crazy one because he is the only one saying this religion is a cult. But, after learning the truth about the religion, he realizes that he is not alone especially after meeting other former Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. According to Lonnie, life goes on and he\u2019s okay with the notion that the people in his past, including his family no longer want to have anything to do with him. Because he believes that he needs to move on to the next chapter in his life. As he loses all the weight that has been on his shoulders, he can sleep good at night because he knows he\u2019s doing the best that he can do. Support the show",

Ashil talks about what life was like having a father that was not interested in participating in Watchtower activities, but made sure she got involved. It\u0027s amazing how he is not willing to make these major sacrifices but has no problems pushing this heavy responsibility on his minor child. The sheer frustration of getting baptized at the age of 12 has Ashli up in arms about being a good Jehovah\u0027s Witness. She has to live up to the responsibility and living the non-stop lifestyle of a JW begins taking its toll on her. She\u0027s looking for a means to escape and in the process makes some weighty decisions that are even more detrimental than remaining home and riding it out until she\u0027s old enough to move out and get her own place. Ashli drops out of high school in the 10th grade and begins working full time. She looks at this approach as a means to accelerating the process of moving out because it will allow her to save enough money to be on her own. Not long afterwards, Ashli meets a brother through mutual friends and after dating for six months, they get married. At age 18, she\u0027s not sure whether or not her situation is better or worse because the only thing she\u0027s done is swapped being home with parents that are ensuring she attends weekly meetings at the Kingdom Hall, to a husband that is virtually doing the same thing. As the interview progresses, Lady Cee and Ashli speak in-depth about Jehovah\u0027s Witness women and their struggles as second class citizens and the difficulty of being free to express oneself in the religion. It\u0027s a topic that is not explored enough in this culture because as they both express the importance of having a voice in relationships where both partners should equally strive to please one another instead of one serving the other\u0027s needs.

After waking up to startling facts about the organization, they, like many Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, are shocked about their findings. Many times, people forget about what it was like being one of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses and how they will respond to anything we say negative about the Watchtower Society. Some have gone out on a limb and shared the information they learned online and have experienced a complete shutdown, and were swiftly cut off from their family and friends. They have not counted the cost of their relationship before speaking up and speaking out. As minor children still living at home, you must realize that you need financial support from your parents and guardians. Others may be working for a brother or sister in the congregation and need your job to pay your bills. What if you rent a room or an apartment and now have to think about other living accommodations? Your security and well-being are more important than imparting knowledge. Be sure to take care of your well-being before speaking out against the religion. Think about the consequences of your actions before divulging too much information about this religion to family and friends. Put the oxygen mask on your face before attempting to help others. You need to ensure you have reached a safe place, and then you can reach back to extend yourself to others. Support the show",

      "description": "Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses stake the claim that they carry out the same practices in their worship all over the world. But, one of the most inconsistent practices in their faith is the one that pertains to the judicial process and disfellowshipping. If you are disfellowshipped and cannot understand why it is taking so long to get reinstated after making multiple requests, chances are there is someone on your judicial case that has a personal agenda against your best interests. There is no consistency on how reinstatement is carried out. It is up to the three individuals that are serving on your committee that determines your fate. It leaves people to ask the question, what am I doing wrong or what am I failing to do? When in fact, the elders may believe that you are not repentant enough. In fact, if you had a different set of elders handling your case, your outcome may have turned out in your favor. This podcast explores some of the unspoken and untold reasons why some people actually languish in a disfellowshipped state not realizing why they are unable to get reinstated. It also discusses how people are treated after they are reinstated. Instead of being immersed in love for returning back to God, they are treated with suspicion that results in unnecessary challenges. Support the show",

      "description": "Do Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses have a policy for shunning former members? The Watchtower lawyers present arguments to the Belgian court system that it is an individual choice whether to shun family. However, this podcast provides excellent proof from their own written publications that they have a system of teaching their adherents to shun former members. In fact, the Watchtower, Bible \u0026 Tract Society has a long history of influencing its members to comply with their teachings even at the cost of dividing families and long-time friendships. https://foref-europe.org/blog/2021/03/19/belgium-the-decision-of-the-court-of-ghent-against-jehovahs-witnesses/ The following links pertain to written comments by Dr. Introvigne, a defender of JW\u0027s who disagrees with the Belgium court: PART ONE https://bitterwinter.org/jehovahs-witnesses-fined-in-ghent-for-their-ostracism-a-wrong-decision/ PART TWO https://bitterwinter.org/the-ghent-jehovahs-witnesses-decision-dangers-for-religious-liberty/ PART THREE https://bitterwinter.org/the-ghent-jehovahs-witness-decision-dangerous-for-all-religions/ The Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 Case On 16 February, a trial started against the Christian Congregation of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses (CCJW) at the criminal court of Ghent (East Flanders) on the alleged grounds of discrimination and incitement to hatred with a particular focus on their shunning (ostracization) practice in cases of disfellowshipping (exclusion) and disassociation (voluntary resignation). A former Jehovah\u2019s Witness who had voluntarily left the movement in 2011, filed a criminal complaint against the CCJW in 2015, and managed to have it supported by over a dozen more former Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. According to the internal religious practice of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, when the elders of a local congregation exclude a member or are notified about a voluntary resignation, they make a short neutral public announcement which states: \u201C[Name of person] is no longer one of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u201D. The CCJW is not involved in the making of that neutral announcement but is notified about the decision. In their conclusions provided to the Court before the trial, they said that they do not segregate excluded or resigning members as these can always attend their religious services. They also point out that baptized Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses who no longer actively associate with fellow believers, are not shunned. Clarifying the relations between Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and disfellowshipped or disassociated family members, they say: \u201CIn the immediate household, although the \u2018religious ties\u2019 the expelled or disassociated person had with his family change, \u2026 blood ties remain. The marriage relationship and normal family affections and dealings continue.\u201D In other words, normal family affection and association continues.

Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses have made life altering decisions based on the information contained in these publications resulting in dire consequences.

At the end of the hearing, the Australian government determined that the best way to address this issue, was to set up a redress scheme. The redress scheme provides the individual with the ability to seek emotional counseling and to collect financial damages for their pain and suffering. Also, another key component is that the institutions are required to acknowledge their lack of responsibility to protect individuals by mishandling their cases. Despite having more than one thousand cases on record, the Watchtower agreed that they never reported any of these cases to the legal authorities. However, they stated that according to their policy it is the responsibility of the individual to report such incidents to the authorities. As a result, members in the community were at risk based on the Watchtower not taking a stand or exhibiting a key role to keep others safe. https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/2021/03/03/jehovahs-witnesses-redress-scheme/ Support the show",

This video discusses the vow of poverty and how it affects those in full-time service and the impact it has for many individuals that live in areas and what happens when they do not pay into social security. Is there anything wrong with taking a vow of poverty? No! However, the Watchtower, Bible \u0026 Tract Society is guilty of hypocrisy for condemning other religious denominations for instituting such an arrangement. Why? Because when they discovered they could take certain tax breaks for doing the same thing, they decided to set up their own vow of poverty system - Worldwide Order of Special Full-Time Servants of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses Unfortunately, such vows did not benefit the Bethelites and other individuals in full-time service. In fact, when it was convenient, the Watchtower dismissed thousands of Bethelites from their assignments. Many of them were released after serving upwards of 30\u0026#43; years at Bethel. One couple was so excited about being accepted to Bethel and after selling their home, donated the money from the sale of their home to the Watchtower Society. Sadly, they were part of the massive layoff of 1,000\u0026#43; Bethelites. References October 1, 1973 Watchtower Support the show",

We discuss the top three things that identify the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses as collective narcissists: 1) Persecution Complex 2) Belief that they are the only true religion 3) They believe they are the center of attention Arc is a fellow YouTuber from a different community that focuses a lot of videos on the topic of Narcissism. He is not affiliated with Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses thus offers an outsiders perspective on the traits of Narcissistic traits. Narcissism is the pursuit of gratification from vanity or egotistic admiration of one\u0027s idealised self image and attributes. The term originated from Greek mythology, where the young Narcissus fell in love with his own image reflected in a pool of water. Collective narcissism (or group narcissism) extends the concept of individual narcissism onto the social level of self. It is a tendency to exaggerate the positive image and importance of a group the individual belongs to \u2013 i.e. the ingroup. Support the show",

In the fifth installment of life at Bethel with JT, he talks about G-Jobbing and how everyone at Bethel was not broke. A lot of the brothers that work in the trades had the opportunity to make money on the side by doing construction jobs at Kingdom Hall\u0027s and the homes of the local friends in the congregation (roofing, laying tile, dry wall, installing carpet, etc.). Others had the opportunity to work as wedding photographers and waiter\u0027s at weddings. And for those individuals that had a skill in cutting hair, they were able to earn a few extra bucks working as a barber to those brothers needing a haircut much sooner than the three weeks allowed at Bethel. For those brothers that had a skill in computer programming, they took their talent to Wall Street and held jobs over there after hours. The opportunities were endless. Of course, all good things must come to an end! And so it did when the issue of tax reporting became a serious issue when Bethelites started receiving 1099\u0027s and were reportedly not filing the extra cash earned on their taxes. Yikes!

      "description": "March is Women\u0027s History Month and this video is dedicated to all of the ladies in the JW and EXJW communities. Women: Brilliant Minds, but why Second? This podcast features a variety of women from around the world providing their own perspective on what it was like being a female in the Jehovah\u0027s Witness community. They share their thoughts on what it means to feel like a second-class citizen. They discuss everything from being asked to clean the men\u2019s bathroom and being dismissed by the circuit overseer to being humiliated by the head covering requirement. Some of the ladies stated that they didn\u2019t even realize they were being treated like a second-class citizen until after they left and began realizing the lunacy of the teachings. JT \u0026 Lady Cee engage in real talk by discussing their own personal issues with how women were treated in the organization. Looking back, JT agrees that the teachings were definitely insane. Most women in the organization fall in line with the Watchtower\u2019s teachings because they believe it is a commandment from God. They become immune to the mistreatment and their mind adjusts thus allowing them to believe it\u0027s normal.
