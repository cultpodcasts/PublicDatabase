      "description": "Ireland, 1984. St Brides School for young ladies opens its doors in the quiet fishing village of Burtonport, county Donegal - but all is not as it seems. The mistresses and \u2018girls\u2019 appear to believe that they live not only in a different century, but in an entirely different world. They are The Silver Sisterhood, a deeply religious group of women who worship a feminine God. They wear Victorian clothing, reject modernity and live by candlelight \u2013 but mysteriously they also begin to release a series of strange computer games apparently based on their unique school and unusual beliefs. Their strange way of life soon gives rise to rumour and speculation, but is any of it true - or is their alternative lifestyle simply fuelling suspicion? Who are these women, what are they doing in Burtonport - and what is really going behind the doors of St Brides?
