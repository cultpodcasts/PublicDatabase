      "description": "On March 8th, we honor EVERY woman\u0027s voice that has risen to speak out against abuse, oppression, and the control of Plymouth Brethren Christian Cult. We celebrate the strength, resilience, and bravery it took to break free from these chains. \n\nThis video is not only a tribute to these survivors but also a heartfelt call to those still confined by the Exclusive Brethren/PBCC. You deserve more than being \u0027voluntold\u0027 to continuously work at Campus and Co, your families business or serving 1000\u0027s of brethren gatherings. You are worth more than sitting in the back of the meeting, your voice muted. You deserve more than a man dictating what you can and can not wear. You deserve more than succumbing to a system built on greed, power, and control over every aspect of your life.\n\nYou are worthy of choosing your own partner, your career, your attire, and most importantly- your OWN path. You are free to think and feel according to your spirit. YOU ARE NOT ALONE! A whole community stands ready to support you, and when you\u0027re ready to break those chains....we are here for you! \nHappy International Woman\u0027s Day 2025!!\n\nLink for insiders-\nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/7ajppt9y3esktyiv\n\nFaith in Practice document- \nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/wcarj4vrbqqc5rjp\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20241011154325/https://theplymouthbrethren.org.uk/beliefs/faith-in-practice/\n\n\nTo share your story or be a guest on the show, email info.getalife@proton.me\n\nGet a Life Paypal donations -\nhttps://www.paypal.me/getalifepodcast\n\nGet a Life GoFundMe-\nhttps://gofund.me/614bcd06\nPayPal link for USA- https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Tz4n35OJ8\n\nOlive Leaf Network- https://oliveleaf.network/\nThinking of Leaving Pamphlet and resources - https://oliveleaf.network/resources/\n\nLink to Anchor/Spotify- https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/G6sjHA2xHwb\n\nAberdeen incident- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1riImgAqwaqGwjYq6vRQIr4_jscJA0eQN/view?usp=sharing\n\nIf we walk in the light letters-\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14WlgJladl1r95YGxW0FbZ0prYfjlg7FU/view?usp=sharing\n\nAdmin/Legal email address:\nstouffvillelegal-gal@protonmail.com\nOffice address:\n22 Braid Bend\nStouffville ON\nL4A 1R7\n\n#plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #expose #exposure #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #rules #strict #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #OneSchoolGlobal #OSG  #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #sect #worldwidesect #worldwidecult #cultescape #cultescapestory #bully #bullying #brokenfamily #awareness #cultescape #cultandculturepodcast #cultescapee #cultescapeer #cultescapeeinterview #askingforhelp #unispace",

Learn how the UK government was defrauded of \u00A3 millions by a written committal that was then secretly verbally withdrawn. Hear about the PBCC trustees who don\u2019t even meet their own definition of being a member of the Brethren, and take a look at the immoral business affairs of Richard Garrett and David Ovenden. \nFinally, some essential advice that every current member of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church needs to urgently consider in order to safeguard their assets ahead of the inevitable crisis that is about to overtake the cult. Every word counts in this damning expos\u00E9, and we challenge the PBCC to go right ahead and sue us for libel if every word of it is not the truth.\n\nLink for insiders-\nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/nbbbqntiprz5ey7g\n\nFaith in Practice document- https://docsend.dropbox.com/view/wcarj4vrbqqc5rjp\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20241011154325/https://theplymouthbrethren.org.uk/beliefs/faith-in-practice/\n\nArticle link-\nhttps://archive.ph/9nSWL\n\nTo share your story or be a guest on the show, email info.getalife@proton.me\n\nGet a Life Paypal donations -\nhttps://www.paypal.me/getalifepodcast\n\nGet a Life GoFundMe-\nhttps://gofund.me/614bcd06\nPayPal link for USA- https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Tz4n35OJ8\n\nOlive Leaf Network- https://oliveleaf.network/\nThinking of Leaving Pamphlet and resources - https://oliveleaf.network/resources/\n\nLink to Anchor/Spotify- https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/G6sjHA2xHwb\n\nAberdeen incident- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1riImgAqwaqGwjYq6vRQIr4_jscJA0eQN/view?usp=sharing\n\nIf we walk in the light letters-\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14WlgJladl1r95YGxW0FbZ0prYfjlg7FU/view?usp=sharing\n\nAdmin/Legal email address:\nstouffvillelegal-gal@protonmail.com\nOffice address:\n22 Braid Bend\nStouffville ON\nL4A 1R7\n\n#plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #expose #exposure #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #rules #strict #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #OneSchoolGlobal #OSG  #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #sect #worldwidesect #worldwidecult #cultescape #cultescapestory #bully #bullying #brokenfamily #awareness #cultescape #cultandculturepodcast #cultescapee #cultescapeer #cultescapeeinterview #askingforhelp #unispace",

      "description": "OneSchool Global currently has almost 100 unfilled vacancies for teachers \u2013 and that number just keeps going up. Why is it so difficult for this extremely well funded school to retain staff? And why are so many teachers and principals simply disappearing mid-term?\nThanks to the courage of Tim, a OneSchool Global teacher who has just left after 2 years at an Australian OSG campus, we now have some answers!\nIn this raw, unscripted  podcast, Tim explains why year 11 and 12 students may never be in the same room as their teachers. How a school\u2019s precious library of community approved books was trashed, and how \u2018special needs\u2019 students are denied the help they require by OSG\u2019s militant global \u201Cone size fits all\u201D policies.\nWe hear how teachers face impossible dilemmas as they have to choose between doing the right thing for their students and keeping their jobs. We learn of the unethical rules imposed on teachers that are only conveyed verbally, never in writing, and the way the cult censors the teachers\u2019 own personal social media accounts to conform with its \u201Cethos\u201D.\nWe hear about the profound lack of any meaningful choice for the students \u2013 not only are they denied university education, but they don\u2019t even get a choice of career \u2013 they are simply allocated to various PBCC owned businesses \u2013 leaving then with no incentive to achieve or to excel.\n\nDespite  shiny new campus facilities, all undergoing the \u201CCampus Modernization\u0022 (money-laundering) Program and adequate wages, OneSchool Global rapidly becomes a death trap for its teachers\u0027 mental and moral health. Tim delivers a stark message to any teachers who may be tempted to take up any of those 100 OSG vacancies. \n\nLink for insiders-\nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/6iemxijgqq4was4w\n\nArticles mentioned in podcast- \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/09/students-under-near-constant-surveillance-at-exclusive-brethren-linked-schools-insiders-claim-oneschool-global-ntwnfb\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/10/wealthy-exclusive-brethren-schools-net-almost-30m-in-disadvantage-payments-ntwnfb\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/16/exclusive-brethren-schools-oneschool-global-funding-ntwnfb\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/08/years-at-exclusive-brethren-school-were-darkest-moments-of-my-life-says-former-student-ntwnfb\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/08/why-guardian-australia-is-investigating-exclusive-brethren-schools\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/24/greens-to-call-for-inquiry-into-public-funding-of-exclusive-brethren-schools-ntwnfb\n\nTo share your story or be a guest on the show, email info.getalife@proton.me\n\nGet a Life Paypal donations -\nhttps://www.paypal.me/getalifepodcast\n\nGet a Life GoFundMe-\nhttps://gofund.me/614bcd06\nPayPal link for USA- https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Tz4n35OJ8\n\nOlive Leaf Network- https://oliveleaf.network/\nThinking of Leaving Pamphlet and resources - https://oliveleaf.network/resources/\n\nLink to Anchor/Spotify- https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/G6sjHA2xHwb\n\nPreston Down Trust Decision-\nhttp://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/media/591398/preston_down_trust_full_decision.pdf\n\nAberdeen incident- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1riImgAqwaqGwjYq6vRQIr4_jscJA0eQN/view?usp=sharing\n\nIf we walk in the light letters-\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14WlgJladl1r95YGxW0FbZ0prYfjlg7FU/view?usp=sharing\n\nAdmin/Legal email address:\nstouffvillelegal-gal@protonmail.com\nOffice address:\n22 Braid Bend\nStouffville ON\nL4A 1R7\n\n#plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #expose #exposure #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #rules #strict #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #OneSchoolGlobal #OSG  #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #sect #worldwidesect #worldwidecult #cultescape #cultescapestory #bully #bullying #brokenfamily #awareness #cultescape #cultandculturepodcast #cultescapee #cultescapeer #cultescapeeinterview #askingforhelp #unispace",

Simon\u2019s business, Playground Centre Limited took on a talented and enthusiastic 19-year old, exploited his energy and loyalty to the utmost extreme for 7 years, lured him to Australia with false and unfulfilled promises of training, promotion and financial assistance, then finally, having extracted everything of value from him, left him to die alone, hanging from his forklift truck. Yes, we are angry and sickened by the greed, cruelty, and hypocrisy of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church and its fake Rapid Relief Team Charity \u2013 and yes , it\u2019s a bloody long podcast \u2013but if you are, like the Filleuls, one of those smug, self-important callous money-grubbing UBT trained PBCC businessmen you need to sit yourself down and watch this podcast again, and again and again\u2026because if YOU f#@k up, it will be your proud, respectable Brethren name on the next episode of Get-a-Life Podcast.\n\nLink for insiders-\nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/it7jfnbp9ny3k98g\n\nSam Keast folder link-\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/snihhd7ut2i1qtf95vccf/AK1H1PBsNP8Cf1mcyhwenP4?rlkey=end0nxzozb8tb4igq7hgh2292\u0026st=0afn03pl\u0026dl=0\n\nLink to articles referred in podcast-\nhttps://www.urbaneffects.co.nz/take-a-seat-whanganui-lets-chat-about-big-things/\n\nhttps://www.worksafe.vic.gov.au/victorias-new-workplace-manslaughter-offences?fbclid=IwY2xjawHtb7ZleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHRoiy-s2y0x-y8th-9WPmNfOv-JB7F853A8018FuD3ztVRivCm6woC0a3A_aem_VoBzcgFcTxnx2ev_ohRmKA\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Ih8CEvq1ZnA?si=2dgqj-PgD1N5bVRv\n\n https://www.leightonassociates.co.nz/post/ducking-and-weaving-on-both-sides-of-the-ditch\n\nhttps://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/family-of-kiwi-tradie-samuel-keast-fights-for-answers-after-suspected-suicide-overseas-uncovers-toxic-workplace/C5IYGW6Q7VEDVKQRGNADDHN25A/\n\nhttps://www.news.com.au/finance/work/at-work/tradies-haunting-google-search-on-final-call/news-story/11ac2bb3e3ec3de9cefdda5670911a31?amp\n\nhttps://www.nzherald.co.nz/whanganui-chronicle/news/whanganuis-playground-centre-builds-play-equipment-for-countries-around-world/VJV5MMNP67TTABQVZLJUKWOHLU/\nother Workplace death-\n\nhttps://www.watoday.com.au/national/western-australia/wa-regulator-investigates-separate-workplace-deaths-on-horror-wednesday-20240404-p5fhjt.html\n\nhttps://archive.ph/vs2y7\n\nhttps://www.worksafe.vic.gov.au/report-incident-criteria-notifiable-incidents\n\nhttps://www.justice.vic.gov.au/saynotobullying?fbclid=IwY2xjawH43kNleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHed7TOuhYeLgj-WSyNB9j3pmBug4hiJWhqyWd0Hqa12oa7eAO45A4mhvBQ_aem_7qKqMJH-J3YZrQm1zJv2SA\n\nTo share your story or be a guest on the show, email info.getalife@proton.me\n\nGet a Life Paypal donations -\nhttps://www.paypal.me/getalifepodcast\n\nGet a Life GoFundMe-\nhttps://gofund.me/614bcd06\nPayPal link for USA- https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Tz4n35OJ8\n\nOlive Leaf Network- https://oliveleaf.network/\nThinking of Leaving Pamphlet and resources - https://oliveleaf.network/resources/\n\nLink to Anchor/Spotify- https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/G6sjHA2xHwb\n\nPreston Down Trust Decision-\nhttp://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/media/591398/preston_down_trust_full_decision.pdf\n\nAberdeen incident- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1riImgAqwaqGwjYq6vRQIr4_jscJA0eQN/view?usp=sharing\n\nIf we walk in the light letters-\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14WlgJladl1r95YGxW0FbZ0prYfjlg7FU/view?usp=sharing\n\nAdmin/Legal email address:\nstouffvillelegal-gal@protonmail.com\nOffice address:\n22 Braid Bend\nStouffville ON\nL4A 1R7\n\n#plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #expose #exposure #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #rules #strict #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #OneSchoolGlobal #OSG  #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #sect #worldwidesect #worldwidecult #cultescape #cultescapestory #bully #bullying #brokenfamily #awareness #cultescape #cultandculturepodcast #cultescapee #cultescapeer #cultescapeeinterview #askingforhelp #unispace",

      "description": "Under the guise of funding OneSchool Global, the PBCC\u2019s leaders have quietly bilked $0.65 billion from their unsuspecting members since 2017. Rather than being used for education, this tax free bullion is stashed in multiple obscure private investment funds around the globe, and used by the tiny elite of ultra-rich PBCC church leaders to fund their own businesses ventures. Every year, the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church\u2019s \u201CGlobal Funding Team\u201D holds a \u201CStrive\u201D fundraiser to collect a further $250 million to add to the pot. Attendance at this Zoom fundraising event, while dressed in church attire, is compulsory for 100% of members, and they must keep their cameras on so that local brethren priests can see that they are attending, and monitor their reactions.\nThe 54,000 assembled victims of this fraud are told a carefully crafted pack of outright lies to the effect that the Brethren\u2019s OneSchool Global desperately needs funds, that Vision Foundation is an endowment fund for this purpose, and that it generates an astonishing 20% return on investment.\nGet-a-Life exposes for he first time the shocking truth that Vision Foundation has actually been losing millions of dollars per year, and far from being an endowment fund, is just a handy source of ready cash for the corrupt Brethren elite.\nWe also expose for the first time the \u201CCampus Modernization Program\u201D and the \u201CHall Standardization Program\u201D further financial scams perpetrated by PBCC leadership to launder $100s of millions of tax-free dollars into their own bank accounts.\nJoin us as we light up for the first time the Affinity Fraud of the Century, as the perpetrators desperately scramble to pull the maximum value from the scam before the Australian Tax Office\u2019s ongoing investigation closes it down for good. \n\nLink for insiders-\nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/wckqr4wiceas25ga\n\nLink for attachments discussed in podcast-\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/mfcbv65ago9seigve50n3/AC2kvJMl_9cEcfRCQpdFB-k?rlkey=x7zlieiatvcavcpzdm1ukrgud\u0026st=ic7hxose\u0026dl=0\n\nLink to Damian Hastie\u0027s website-\nhttps://www.brethrenexposed.com/investigations.html\n\nArticle/website links-\nGrace Trust on Charity Commission website\nhttps://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/en/charity-search/-/charity-details/257516 \n\nNAF on Charity Commission website \nhttps://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/en/charity-search/-/charity-details/5101784 \n\nWikipedia article on Affinity Fraud \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_fraud \n\nAffinity Fraud news article\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/06/religious-based-financial-fraud-is-rampant-heres-how-to-fight-it.html \n\nGAL Tax Fraud and Embezzlement podcast\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gn8X-REFPSQ\n\nGAL OneSchool/Unispace Money Laundering podcast\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8\u0026t=3034s\n\nGAL Australian Tax Office raid UBT podcast\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl8WmlBGonI\n\nVision Income Fund- AU past ROI-\nhttps://www.oneinvestment.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Vision-Income-Fund-year-end-Financial-Statements-31.12.2023.pdf\n\nTo share your story or be a guest on the show, email info.getalife@proton.me\n\nGet a Life Paypal donations -\nhttps://www.paypal.me/getalifepodcast\n\nGet a Life GoFundMe-\nhttps://gofund.me/614bcd06\nPayPal link for USA- https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Tz4n35OJ8\n\nOlive Leaf Network- https://oliveleaf.network/\nThinking of Leaving Pamphlet and resources - https://oliveleaf.network/resources/\n\nLink to Anchor/Spotify- https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/G6sjHA2xHwb\n\nPreston Down Trust Decision-\nhttp://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/media/591398/preston_down_trust_full_decision.pdf\n\nAberdeen incident- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1riImgAqwaqGwjYq6vRQIr4_jscJA0eQN/view?usp=sharing\n\nIf we walk in the light letters-\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14WlgJladl1r95YGxW0FbZ0prYfjlg7FU/view?usp=sharing\n\nAdmin/Legal email address:\nstouffvillelegal-gal@protonmail.com\nOffice address:\n22 Braid Bend\nStouffville ON\nL4A 1R7\n\n#plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #expose #exposure #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #rules #strict #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #OneSchoolGlobal #OSG  #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #sect #worldwidesect #worldwidecult #cultescape #cultescapestory #bully #bullying #brokenfamily #awareness #cultescape #cultandculturepodcast #cultescapee #cultescapeer #cultescapeeinterview #askingforhelp #unispace",

Helen dives into her career and how she made sure she had a path to do what she was passionate about.  Helen shares the emotional challenges faced upon returning home during her mother\u0027s final days. Helen was privileged enough to be up front and center during her mother\u0027s illness and even attended a meeting where she recounts how she was able to go back inside. She wasn\u0027t allowed through the front door and wasn\u0027t allowed to sit with everyone, but she explains her reasoning for sitting through another boring meeting. It was a roller coaster of emotions trying to build a relationship with her family still inside the cult. At times, these interactions were positive, and other times, the interactions were extremely painful.  But Helen persevered and has great advice on how to manage these circumstances we all find ourselves in.\n\nLink for insiders -\n https://docsend.dropbox.com/view/3ak4vxmb55yxnghy\n\nTo share your story or be a guest on the show, email info.getalife@proton.me\n\nGet a Life Paypal donations -\nhttps://www.paypal.me/getalifepodcast\n\nGet a Life GoFundMe-\nhttps://gofund.me/614bcd06\nPayPal link for USA- https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Tz4n35OJ8\n\nOlive Leaf Network- https://oliveleaf.network/\nThinking of Leaving Pamphlet and resources - https://oliveleaf.network/resources/\n\nLink to Anchor/Spotify- https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/G6sjHA2xHwb\n\nPreston Down Trust Decision-\nhttp://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/media/591398/preston_down_trust_full_decision.pdf\n\nAberdeen incident- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1riImgAqwaqGwjYq6vRQIr4_jscJA0eQN/view?usp=sharing\n\nIf we walk in the light letters-\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14WlgJladl1r95YGxW0FbZ0prYfjlg7FU/view?usp=sharing\n\nAdmin/Legal email address:\nstouffvillelegal-gal@protonmail.com\nOffice address:\n22 Braid Bend\nStouffville ON\nL4A 1R7\n\n#plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #expose #exposure #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #rules #strict #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #OneSchoolGlobal #OSG  #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #sect #worldwidesect #worldwidecult #cultescape #cultescapestory #bully #bullying #brokenfamily #awareness #cultescape #cultandculturepodcast #cultescapee #cultescapeer #cultescapeeinterview #askingforhelp #unispace",

She also knew doing so would rip apart the tight-knit and loving family she was born into. \n\nIn part one, Helen talks us through how she navigated this dilemma both emotionally and practically culminating in her leaving at the age of 16, including the pressure she was put under through weekly priestly visits. She takes us on a journey of what it was like collecting signatures from the important members inside the sect, including a prominent drawing from James Symington. There\u0027s also a shocking story that continues to be the dilemma in this patriarchal cult.\n\nJoin Jacky, Ross, and Andrea unpack another survivor story that ends with many, many blessings. \n\nLink for insiders -\nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/zq6yr8znecwmh595\n\nTo share your story or be a guest on the show, email info.getalife@proton.me\n\nGet a Life Paypal donations -\nhttps://www.paypal.me/getalifepodcast\n\nGet a Life GoFundMe-\nhttps://gofund.me/614bcd06\nPayPal link for USA- https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Tz4n35OJ8\n\nOlive Leaf Network- https://oliveleaf.network/\nThinking of Leaving Pamphlet and resources - https://oliveleaf.network/resources/\n\nLink to Anchor/Spotify- https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/G6sjHA2xHwb\n\nPreston Down Trust Decision-\nhttp://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/media/591398/preston_down_trust_full_decision.pdf\n\nAberdeen incident- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1riImgAqwaqGwjYq6vRQIr4_jscJA0eQN/view?usp=sharing\n\nIf we walk in the light letters-\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14WlgJladl1r95YGxW0FbZ0prYfjlg7FU/view?usp=sharing\n\nAdmin/Legal email address:\nstouffvillelegal-gal@protonmail.com\nOffice address:\n22 Braid Bend\nStouffville ON\nL4A 1R7\n\n#plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #expose #exposure #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #rules #strict #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #OneSchoolGlobal #OSG  #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #sect #worldwidesect #worldwidecult #cultescape #cultescapestory #bully #bullying #brokenfamily #awareness #cultescape #cultandculturepodcast #cultescapee #cultescapeer #cultescapeeinterview #askingforhelp #unispace",

      "description": "Three stunning court cases have turned the tide in the cult\u2019s long saga of vexatious litigation and SLAPP tactics against their critics. Following the example of Scientology, the exclusive brethren cult\u2019s leaders have pursued a massively expensive undercover operation to harass outspoken former members with spurious and unreasonable court cases. Every congregation globally has been pressured into contributing to a huge legal slush fund, ostensibly to \u201Cprotect the testimony\u201D.\nTo give the so-called church \u201Ccredible deniability\u201D these legal cases are always taken by PBCC members personally, or by their businesses \u2013 these act as surrogates for the cult to maintain the fiction that the PBCC, as required by law, treats former members in a fair and compassionate manner. \nIn this intensive documentary style podcast, we hear eyewitness accounts of the courtroom dramas, and we show you numerous documents and reports that have never been published before. Dennis Wragge describes his dramatic intervention in a Toronto courtroom, where he was unexpectedly given the podium and invited to speak about the cult\u2019s abuse of process. Guy Wilson takes us inside the UK courthouse in Leeds and recounts his interactions with Jed Christie and the infamous Charlotte Harris. We read the brethren\u2019s own lawyers account of the David Wallace kidnapping saga and the mysterious appearance of a prominent member of the Hales family in a Canadian courtroom in the dead of winter. \nThese recent cases in the UK and Canada have seen the PBCC\u2019s veneer of deniability publicly shredded, as a judge stated in public court that it was the CULT that was directing the \u201Cattack-dog\u201D lawyers, and that the actual claimants were just puppets. This bold precedent will make future malicious attacks against PBCC critics all but impossible.\nA few short years ago, the Hales Money Machine seemed almost invulnerable, using its financial clout to bribe and bully their way to whatever goal they set their greedy eyes upon. What a change we see now! The PBCC is in full retreat on every front - their public credibility destroyed by in-depth media investigations, their reputation now too toxic for politicians to dare to be associated with them, and their once feared lawyers exposed for the grossly overpaid immoral parasites that they really are. \nThe Bruce Hales regime has been on an alcohol and arrogance fueled slippery slope for a while now.

      "description": "Speaking out against the Brethren isn\u0027t just a story; it\u0027s a call to action. The courage it takes to voice one\u0027s truth against the odds is powerful. Craig Hoyle chooses honesty over silence, pushing for a change. Our final episode in this 3 part series takes us from chapter 13 to the end of the book revealing Craig\u0027s life after leaving the PBCC/ Exclusive Brethren. In this episode, we cover RRT, animal cruelty, car chases, sexual abuse of those that came before us, Faith in Practice document, gaining new family on the outside, and so much more. This tear jerking episode also highlights what our younger siblings may have gone through as we left. \n\nCraig reveals a number of incidents with the PBCC, but one in particular is the car chase that occurred when he was filming. In true PBCC fashion, their view on protecting the testimony washed all reason from their actions, and police were involved. We dive into the animal cruelty that has resulted from this indoctrinated arrogance. \n\nFrom fending off surveillance to chasing justice, the journey of ex-members is daunting yet empowering. Exposing the Brethren\u2019s control tactics is no small feat. But as Craig points out, staying silent fosters the persistence of injustices. Our time is now to use our voices and have these changes made!\nAll links to articles, videos, and references made in this episode are in the description of podcast below.\n\nLink for insiders -\nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/47cmfujkafrpfufd\n\nLink to purchase Excommunicated and other memoirs -\nhttps://www.get-a-life.net/books\n\nLink to 60 Minutes story - \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXdxn1W_xk8\n\nLink to Car Chase with Channel 7-\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xqxTocjjOA\u0026t=15s\n\nLink to articles quoted in podcast-\nhttps://www.thepress.co.nz/nz-news/350451583/group-filmed-man-hit-deer-his-car-gratuitous-act\nhttps://www.miragenews.com/three-charged-in-nz-for-deliberate-deer-ramming-1214680/\nhttps://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/group-of-young-people-drive-car-into-deer-kill-a-stag-in-nelson/UV2RJTAYERHSTIBX6WBE4WBI5Y/\nhttps://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-news/350246390/caught-tape-men-arrested-after-allegedly-deliberately-driving-deer-killing-stag\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/feb/05/oakval-farm-nsw-man-throws-chicken-betty-white-to-alligators-allegations-peter-william-smith\nhttps://nypost.com/2024/09/24/world-news/beloved-australian-chicken-with-famous-name-tossed-into-alligator-pen-shocking-wildlife-park-visitors-report/\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/sep/24/peter-smith-pet-chicken-alligator-charges-trial-ntwnfb\nhttps://www.1news.co.nz/2024/09/24/nsw-man-tossed-beloved-chicken-to-feed-a-hungry-alligator/\nhttps://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-24/man-pleads-guilty-to-throwing-chicken-to-alligators/104388320\nhttps://www.9news.com.au/national/man-tossed-beloved-chicken-to-feed-a-hungry-alligator/26c762ea-482f-425b-b381-fd1df0ba53bd\nhttps://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-05/peter-smith-pleads-not-guilty-to-alleged-animal-cruelty-chicken/103426320\n\nLink to Cult Chat Episode 15 Organizations under threat-\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFK0RPztgEg\n\nLink to research survey-\nhttps://app.onlinesurveys.jisc.ac.uk/s/salford/health-wellbeing-former-members\n\nTo share your story or be a guest on the show, email info.getalife@proton.me\n\nGet a Life Paypal donations -\nhttps://www.paypal.me/getalifepodcast\n\nGet a Life GoFundMe-\nhttps://gofund.me/614bcd06\nPayPal link for USA- https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Tz4n35OJ8\n\nOlive Leaf Network- https://oliveleaf.network/\nThinking of Leaving Pamphlet and resources - https://oliveleaf.network/resources/\n\nLink to Anchor/Spotify- https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/G6sjHA2xHwb\n\nLink for if we walk in the light letters -\nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/jtv64vb78wzag8i8\n\nPreston Down Trust Decision-\nhttp://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/media/591398/preston_down_trust_full_decision.pdf\n\nAberdeen Evidence-\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/2ga87dyg7ku9efa6mj286/h?rlkey=3rus6ynyjcwilcqe4akjo9xe6\u0026st=wmzd1ve9\u0026dl=0\n\n\nAdmin/Legal email address:\nStouffville-GAL@protonmail.com\nOffice address:\n22 Braid Bend\nStouffville ON\nL4A 1R7\n\n#plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #expose #exposure #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #rules #strict #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #OneSchoolGlobal #OSG  #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #sect #worldwidesect #worldwidecult #cultescape #cultescapestory #bully #bullying #brokenfamily #awareness #cultescape #cultandculturepodcast #cultescapee #cultescapeer #cultescapeeinterview #askingforhelp #unispace #cultawareness",

Lindy responds with a thorough theological breakdown on the misuse of scripture in high demand religious groups.  Craig continues to narrate important highlights from his book, Excommunicated, as we dive into his journey, getting ready to leave, in chapters 8-12. Craig takes us on his journey into living in Sydney and the PBCC\u0027s leader Bruce Hales\u0027 solution to fix Craig being gay.  We discuss the never-ending subject of the misuse of alcohol in the brethren and the infamous May \u002705 letter where Bruce Hales asserted authority and saw who was all in alignment with him. We reveal that this May \u002705 letter was a monumental move by Bruce etched in everyone\u0027s mind, just like Aberdeen. (Link below of letter)\nCraig threads together more of his ancestry with letters, and we also discuss the past excommunication of the Hales\u0027 family. Below, you will find a transcript of that meeting in 1965. \nStay tuned for Part 3, where we discuss life after leaving and how that looked for Craig and his family.  \n\nLink for insiders -\nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/zzakyxk6eg83jwew\n\nLink to purchase Excommunicated and other memoirs -\nhttps://www.get-a-life.net/books\n\nLink to George\u0027s Letter-\nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/q9vqewap4hp8yymx\n\nLink to Assembly meeting 1965 with WBH JSH October 1965-\nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/dx3eb85d7ifac9m8\n\nLink to May \u002705 letter-\nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/rezqvtz5wz6ke4cp\n\nTo share your story or be a guest on the show, email info.getalife@proton.me\n\nGet a Life Paypal donations -\nhttps://www.paypal.me/getalifepodcast\n\nGet a Life GoFundMe-\nhttps://gofund.me/614bcd06\nPayPal link for USA- https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Tz4n35OJ8\n\nOlive Leaf Network- https://oliveleaf.network/\nThinking of Leaving Pamphlet and resources - https://oliveleaf.network/resources/\n\nLink to Anchor/Spotify- https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/G6sjHA2xHwb\n\nLink for if we walk in the light letters -\nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/jtv64vb78wzag8i8\n\nPreston Down Trust Decision-\nhttp://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/media/591398/preston_down_trust_full_decision.pdf\n\nAberdeen Evidence-\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/2ga87dyg7ku9efa6mj286/h?rlkey=3rus6ynyjcwilcqe4akjo9xe6\u0026st=wmzd1ve9\u0026dl=0\n\n\nAdmin/Legal email address:\nStouffville-GAL@protonmail.com\nOffice address:\n22 Braid Bend\nStouffville ON\nL4A 1R7\n\n#plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #expose #exposure #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #rules #strict #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #OneSchoolGlobal #OSG  #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #sect #worldwidesect #worldwidecult #cultescape #cultescapestory #bully #bullying #brokenfamily #awareness #cultescape #cultandculturepodcast #cultescapee #cultescapeer #cultescapeeinterview #askingforhelp #unispace #cultawareness",

In this episode, we delve deeper into the experiences of individuals who have left the FLDS and LDS Church, shedding light on the inner workings and control exerted by charismatic leaders like Warren Jeffs and Bruce Hales. Sam and Melissa from @GrowingUpinPolygamy share their personal journeys, the impact of fear-based teachings, and the struggles of self-discovery outside of these restrictive communities. We explore the suppression of information, manipulation of followers, and the disturbing pattern of setting dates for apocalyptic events such as the rapture.

      "description": "Sam and Melissa founded the @GrowingUpinPolygamy  to help survivors of the fundamentalist Mormon cult, Warren Jeffs FLDS, and other extremist high-control groups. As we discuss our experiences, we discover that polygamy aside, the FLDS and the PBCC are remarkably similar in their history, leadership, and mechanisms of physical, mental, and spiritual control and abuse. We also compare the PBCC with the mainstream Mormon LDS, with their doomsday ideology, racism and their recent attempts to position themselves as a \u0022Mainstream Christian Church\u0022 (sound familiar?) Sam describes his heart wrenching exit from the FLDS and the impact it had on his family. If you hadn\u0027t known he was from the FLDS, it would sound as if we were interviewing a recent leaver from the PBCC. Part 1 hopefully helps those inside question- \u0022How can there be so many other groups claiming to be the only way and to have the one and only Man of God bringing the word to them?\u0022 Stay tuned for part 2 as we continue to dive into the FLDS leader and how he continues to lead from jail.\n\nLink for insiders-  https://docsend.dropbox.com/view/gen7g3fuc8i3cci9\n\nTo share your story or be a guest on the show, email info.getalife@proton.me\n\nGet a Life Paypal donations -\nhttps://www.paypal.me/getalifepodcast\n\nGet a Life GoFundMe-\nhttps://gofund.me/614bcd06\nPayPal link for USA- https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Tz4n35OJ8\n\n\nOlive Leaf Network- https://oliveleaf.network/\nThinking of Leaving Pamphlet and resources - https://oliveleaf.network/resources/\n\nLink to Anchor/Spotify- https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/G6sjHA2xHwb\n\nPreston Down Trust Decision-\nhttp://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/media/591398/preston_down_trust_full_decision.pdf\n\nAberdeen incident- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1riImgAqwaqGwjYq6vRQIr4_jscJA0eQN/view?usp=sharing\n\nIf we walk in the light letters-\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14WlgJladl1r95YGxW0FbZ0prYfjlg7FU/view?usp=sharing\n\nAdmin/Legal email address:\nStouffville-GAL@protonmail.com\nOffice address:\n22 Braid Bend\nStouffville ON\nL4A 1R7\n\n#plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #expose #exposure #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #rules #strict #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #OneSchoolGlobal #OSG  #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #sect #worldwidesect #worldwidecult #cultescape #cultescapestory #bully #bullying #brokenfamily #awareness #cultescape #cultandculturepodcast #cultescapee #cultescapeer #cultescapeeinterview #askingforhelp #unispace",

In this episode, Isaac really dives into what helped him gain his strength and balance in the world outside of the PBCC. From moments of heartache to rediscovering hope, Isaac\u0027s story is a testament to what we all can overcome. We discuss the impact of trauma, the importance of finding the right therapist, and the power of community. Finally, Isaac reads out his letter to the PBCC\u0027s \u0022Man of God\u0022 Bruce Hales. This letter was very well articulated and Isaac\u0027s response he got from the priests is what we all would expect. Isaac\u0027s story is such a testament to the kind hearted soul he is and how his versatility and willingness to sit with his trauma allowed him to create an incredible and fulfilling life for himself. \n\nlink for insiders-\nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/kxue99uchi4vcrsi\n\nLINK TO RESEARCH QUESTIONNAIRE- https://app.onlinesurveys.jisc.ac.uk/s/salford/health-wellbeing-former-members\n\nTo share your story or be a guest on the show, email info.getalife@proton.me\n\nGet a Life Paypal donations -\nhttps://www.paypal.me/getalifepodcast\n\nGet a Life GoFundMe-\nhttps://gofund.me/614bcd06\nPayPal link for USA- https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Tz4n35OJ8\n\n\nOlive Leaf Network- https://oliveleaf.network/\nThinking of Leaving Pamphlet and resources - https://oliveleaf.network/resources/\n\nLink to Anchor/Spotify- https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/G6sjHA2xHwb\n\nPreston Down Trust Decision-\nhttp://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/media/591398/preston_down_trust_full_decision.pdf\n\nAberdeen incident- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1riImgAqwaqGwjYq6vRQIr4_jscJA0eQN/view?usp=sharing\n\nIf we walk in the light letters-\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14WlgJladl1r95YGxW0FbZ0prYfjlg7FU/view?usp=sharing\n\nAdmin/Legal email address:\nStouffville-GAL@protonmail.com\nOffice address:\n22 Braid Bend\nStouffville ON\nL4A 1R7\n\n#plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #expose #exposure #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #rules #strict #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #OneSchoolGlobal #OSG  #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #sect #worldwidesect #worldwidecult #cultescape #cultescapestory #bully #bullying #brokenfamily #awareness #cultescape #cultandculturepodcast #cultescapee #cultescapeer #cultescapeeinterview #askingforhelp #unispace",

      "description": "TRIGGER WARNING! This podcast contains discussions on physical abuse, sexual abuse, and suicide. Viewer discretion is advised.\n\nIsaac\u0027s story originates in New Zealand with an abusive father that he couldn\u0027t escape from. In this inspiring story, Isaac shares what it was like growing up in the PBCC, where he not only suffered physical abuse but also sexual abuse. He describes his journey with the priests and how he was confined to a tiny apartment for over a year. The biggest takeaway from this harrowing story is the way Isaac found a way to stand back up and create an incredible life for himself. His messages to others in a predicament like he was and to the insiders will have you in tears with his bravery and heartfelt plea to the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. What would life have been like had the PBCC taught sex education and consent? What could have been prevented had there been anger management classes for his father and accountability? How do priests get away with heartless treatment and confinement? This is a story that would sure spark some change inside the PBCC if they were listening to the pain of each and every survivor that comes forward. Part 1 of Isaac\u0027s story is just the lead up to a letter to Bruce Hales in Part 2.

Lyle and Andrea and their 2 beautiful daughters made it out of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church in tact and are thriving in every way that is possible. Andrea takes us back to the day they left and walks us through what that first week was like. She opens up about the challenges of transitioning to life outside the community, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing emotional well-being and safety for her children. From confronting hurtful messages to the joy of newfound freedom and finding supportive connections, Andrea\u0027s story is a testament to resilience and the pursuit of happiness. They are the storybook we all want to read about and even though the heartache of the family they had to leave behind is there, this will inspire those inside to take that leap of faith and own what\u0027s rightfully theirs-FREEDOM!

      "description": "Join us as we dive into Tam Bennett\u0027s letter she wrote to the entire PBCC community when she left with he brothers in 2018. This letter addresses all the reasons why we continue doing what we do. We discuss the judgment that is placed on any diversity; the lack of empathy, compassion and kindness towards non-community members, especially those that are non-Caucasian; their fear tactics they use on children; their restriction of information that takes away the right of anyone making informed decisions; the lack of diversity in career choices; the hierarchal system that disadvantages weaker members; the system that disallows any room for creativity and most of all the God-like status they give a man. Tam dives into the racism, sexism and what it was like for her to grow up in a cult that doesn\u0027t embrace gay people. The most rewarding part of this podcast is the shining light her and her brothers can be as she offers hope to those inside that leaving with family is possible. Her message to those inside at the end will leave you with chills from head to toe!\nWe end the podcast with a song from another ex-member. Dawson is a 24 year old British/Swiss artist and songwriter and is getting his start in the music world. His songs are very personal and moving and very relatable for the LGBTQI community. He finds comfort and strength in journaling his feelings, emotions and struggles through writing his own songs. His experience of leaving a controlling cult and plunging into a world where everyone is accepted the way they are inspired his song, Rainbow Lovers.

Through a series of heartfelt and personal anecdotes, he revisits his time within the cult and also talks in detail about the PBCC customs and traditions. This volume contains his most viral video to his mother with over 2 million views!\n\nThese video clips offer a deeply personal glimpse into the life of someone who courageously broke free from the oppressive confines of a cult. His narrative is one of resilience and hope, highlighting the importance of self-acceptance and the strength found in embracing one\u0027s true identity.\n\nJoin us as we follow his journey from darkness to light, understanding the complexities of his past, and celebrating the liberation that comes with living authentically. This compilation is not just a story of survival, but a testament to the power of human spirit and the enduring quest for personal freedom and we love his charismatic personality as he engages with the audience on TikTok!\n\nLink for insiders -\nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/fhp6em4cbepqncz9\n\nTo share your story or be a guest on the show, email info.getalife@proton.me\n\nGet a Life Paypal donations -\nhttps://www.paypal.me/getalifepodcast\n\nGet a Life GoFundMe-\nhttps://gofund.me/614bcd06\nPayPal link for USA- https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Tz4n35OJ8\n\n\nOlive Leaf Network- https://oliveleaf.network/\nThinking of Leaving Pamphlet and resources - https://oliveleaf.network/resources/\n\nLink to Anchor/Spotify- https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/G6sjHA2xHwb\n\nPreston Down Trust Decision-\nhttp://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/media/591398/preston_down_trust_full_decision.pdf\n\nAberdeen incident- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1riImgAqwaqGwjYq6vRQIr4_jscJA0eQN/view?usp=sharing\n\nIf we walk in the light letters-\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14WlgJladl1r95YGxW0FbZ0prYfjlg7FU/view?usp=sharing\n\nAdmin/Legal email address:\nStouffville-GAL@protonmail.com\nOffice address:\n22 Braid Bend\nStouffville ON\nL4A 1R7\n\n#plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #expose #exposure #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #rules #strict #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #OneSchoolGlobal #OSG  #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #sect #worldwidesect #worldwidecult #cultescape #cultescapestory #bully #bullying #brokenfamily #awareness #cultescape #cultandculturepodcast #cultescapee #cultescapeer #cultescapeeinterview #askingforhelp #unispace",

      "description": "Many leavers of the PBCC (exclusive brethren) have struggled or are struggling with their mental well-being. \n\nTo what extent does being born and raised in a high control group such as the PBCC contribute to this struggle? Many would say it does, but what actual evidence is there to support this hypothesis? \n\nResearch provides that evidence. Join us as we talk to Jill Aebi Mytton about new research being carried out through the University of Salford with Dr Rod Dubrow-Marshall and Dr Linda Dubrow-Marshall. Jill explains to us the concept behind this research and how it will be used. \n\nCompleting this questionnaire will be the start of the evidence needed to effect change. Research reports can be used to influence the police, therapists, and other authority bodies to understand the detrimental effects of leaving a cult. Importantly, it can also be used to influence politicians to bring about law changes to inhibit the harm caused by cultic groups.\n\nSo, listen to the podcast and then ask yourself \u2013 do you want change enough to take the time to be part of this significant research?\nLINK TO RESEARCH QUESTIONNAIRE- https://app.onlinesurveys.jisc.ac.uk/s/salford/health-wellbeing-former-members\nLink for insiders- https://docsend.dropbox.com/view/zza9gisbe5q2z3zz\n\nTo share your story or be a guest on the show, email info.getalife@proton.me\n\nGet a Life Paypal donations -\nhttps://www.paypal.me/getalifepodcast\n\nGet a Life GoFundMe-\nhttps://gofund.me/614bcd06\nPayPal link for USA- https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Tz4n3...\n\nOlive Leaf Network- https://oliveleaf.network/\nThinking of Leaving Pamphlet and resources - https://oliveleaf.network/resources/\n\nLink to Anchor/Spotify- https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/...\n\nPreston Down Trust Decision-\nhttp://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/m...\n\nAberdeen incident- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1riIm...\n\nIf we walk in the light letters-\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14Wlg...\n\nAdmin/Legal email address:\nStouffville-GAL@protonmail.com\nOffice address:\n22 Braid Bend\nStouffville ON\nL4A 1R7\n\n#plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #expose #exposure #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #rules #strict #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #OneSchoolGlobal #OSG  #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #sect #worldwidesect #worldwidecult #cultescape #cultescapestory #bully #bullying #brokenfamily #awareness #cultescape #cultandculturepodcast #cultescapee #cultescapeer #cultescapeeinterview #askingforhelp #shunning",

      "description": "What a story this is! Born into an intensely homophobic and misogynist cult, Joey Green comes to the realization that she is a lesbian \u2013 and to make a bad situation worse, her father is an outspoken anti-gay activist. Joey was on episode 93 as anonymous and came back as herself to fill in many parts of her story she wasn\u0027t able to fill in before. One of those stories, along with many others, is alcohol in water bottles at school!\nGrowing up in the isolationist Plymouth Brethren Christian Church cult, where women are treated as inferiors and homosexuality is actively hated, a young girl overcomes all these barriers to become the happy and confident non-binary personality that we see and hear on this podcast \u2013 a sparkling witness to the transformation that takes place when a person breaks free and can live their true identity.\nWe then take a look at Myles and Lee Admiraal, prominent and extremely wealthy PBCC business owners who have a dark history of homophobic hatred and harassment, leading to a damning court case in Montreal. This revealing court case really shows how these children take the leaders\u0027 hatred and then act them out in society. Ben discusses a horrifying field trip that also ended in physical hatred towards the LGBTQ community. \nTo finish off, we have Bruce Thompson\u2019 performing his latest song \u201CTop of the Tree\u201D a reflection on the wealth and power of the Exclusive Brethren\u2019s \u201CMan of God\u201D. Bruce\u0027s music is really resonating and bringing solace to many ex-members. \nAll links to articles, court cases, and Bruce\u0027s music in the description below.\n\nLink for insiders -\nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/fnq4d5eu8wiqphup\n\nLink to Lee Admiraal court case -\nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/ytpfd9x7y5r7zjcj\n\nLinks to articles mentioned in podcast-\nhttps://pressprogress.ca/religious-sect-that-tried-to-censor-lgbtq-content-from-human-rights-museum-also-asked-george-w-bush-to-stop-gay-marriage-in-canada-documents-show/\n\nhttps://montrealgazette.com/news/world/gay-rights-activist-makes-pointe-claire-council-bid\n\nhttps://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/liberal-donors-the-exclusive-brethren-deny-being-antigay-heres-proof-they-are-20160619-gpmkci.html\n\nLink to Bruce Thompson\u0027s song \u0022Top of the Tree\u0022-\nhttps://youtu.be/SPXmS9H3VK8?si=3AaWxPVt6OkRWhM-\n\nTo share your story or be a guest on the show, email info.getalife@proton.me\n\nGet a Life Paypal donations -\nhttps://www.paypal.me/getalifepodcast\n\nGet a Life GoFundMe-\nhttps://gofund.me/614bcd06\nPayPal link for USA- https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Tz4n3...\n\nRoss Turner GoFundMe- https://gofund.me/390b7528\n\nHeidi McCamley Custody Battle GoFundMe- \nhttps://gofund.me/6711fc74\n\nOlive Leaf Network- https://oliveleaf.network/\nThinking of Leaving Pamphlet and resources - https://oliveleaf.network/resources/\n\nLink to Anchor/Spotify- https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/...\n\nPreston Down Trust Decision-\nhttp://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/m...\n\nAberdeen incident- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1riIm...\n\nIf we walk in the light letters-\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14Wlg...\n\nAdmin/Legal email address:\nStouffville-GAL@protonmail.com\nOffice address:\n22 Braid Bend\nStouffville ON\nL4A 1R7\n\n#plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #expose #exposure #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #rules #strict #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #OneSchoolGlobal #OSG  #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #sect #worldwidesect #worldwidecult #cultescape #cultescapestory #bully #bullying #brokenfamily #awareness #cultescape #cultandculturepodcast #cultescapee #cultescapeer #cultescapeeinterview #askingforhelp #shunning",

      "description": "Get-a-Life smashes through the Brethren\u2019s \u201Cwall of separation\u201D with this first ever interview of a current and participating member of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church.  After listening to the mandatory Friday night recording of Cult Messiah Bruce D. Hales, and before attending the mandatory Saturday morning Cult Bible Reading, PBCC \u201Csister\u201D Andrea Becker took the time to record this groundbreaking podcast with Get-a-Life\u2019s Cheryl and Lane. \nAndrea Becker (originally MacKinnon from Montreal) lives with her husband Lyle and two daughters in the German town of Bad Endbach. Andrea tells how their belief in the Brethren\u2018s doctrine was shaken by the blatant dishonesty of the system and the cruel treatment of leavers. Together with her husband, they planned to leave, rather than to bring up their daughters in a cult that treats women as inferior and voiceless servants to the men. With their plans all made, but kept entirely secret from their unsuspecting local brethren and their many relatives in the cult, Andrea recorded this interview telling of both the elation and the fear that filled them as they faced their D-day \u2013 just one week ahead.\nDid their months of careful preparation succeed? Did they escape as a family, unscathed? \nListen to the end of this intense podcast to find out!\n\nLink for insiders - \n\nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/43bvmwnxeg74m6i9\n\nTo share your story or be a guest on the show, email info.getalife@proton.me\n\nGet a Life Paypal donations -\nhttps://www.paypal.me/getalifepodcast\n\nGet a Life GoFundMe-\nhttps://gofund.me/614bcd06\nPayPal link for USA- https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Tz4n3...\n\nRoss Turner GoFundMe- https://gofund.me/390b7528\n\nHeidi McCamley Custody Battle GoFundMe- \nhttps://gofund.me/6711fc74\n\nOlive Leaf Network- https://oliveleaf.network/\nThinking of Leaving Pamphlet and resources - https://oliveleaf.network/resources/\n\nLink to Anchor/Spotify- https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/...\n\nPreston Down Trust Decision-\nhttp://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/m...\n\nAberdeen incident- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1riIm...\n\nIf we walk in the light letters-\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14Wlg...\n\nAdmin/Legal email address:\nStouffville-GAL@protonmail.com\nOffice address:\n22 Braid Bend\nStouffville ON\nL4A 1R7\n\n#plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #expose #exposure #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #rules #strict #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #OneSchoolGlobal #OSG  #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #sect #worldwidesect #worldwidecult #cultescape #cultescapestory #bully #bullying #brokenfamily #awareness #cultescape #cultandculturepodcast #cultescapee #cultescapeer #cultescapeeinterview #askingforhelp #shunning",

      "description": "For a community of compassionate and caring Christians, the PBCC businesses tend to get the opposite reviews from former non-community members. Matthew\u0027s story isn\u0027t anything new to us, but still is heart wrenching to listen to. The comments on social media, messages, and emails sent to us by former and current employees all have the same theme - it\u0027s a toxic, misogynistic, and racist environment to work in. In Matthew\u0027s case, having an 18 year old daughter of his own was the catalyst that made him leave. He couldn\u0027t imagine his daughter being treated the way these PBCC members treated others. \nWhat started out as an incredible job, Matthew quickly realized that all they wanted him for was his expertise and not to maintain dignity or a safe workplace emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. The workplace became very toxic, with PBCC members being caught taking pictures up girl\u0027s skirts, alcohol everywhere, and misogyny he couldn\u0027t bear to witness. Accountability was not given to the girl who was violated, but rather, she was let go, and the perpetrator got to keep his job. He was told another girl was only hired for her looks. He quickly realized they did not value women at all. \nMatthew spoke his mind and asked questions! He takes us on his 2 year journey of homophobia and racism, alcohol in the workplace, getting ready for Dean Hales and how he actually ate with them. In his words- he never saw any signs of the values they speak of and reiterates he would NEVER work for another PBCC company ever again. He sends a potent message after recording this episode on how much they disliked ex-members. It\u0027s nothing new to us but Bruce definitely isn\u0027t showing his flock how to have care and compassion to others that have left like they say they are. \n\nLink for insiders -\nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/j4futqq4562japqg\n\nTo share your story or be a guest on the show, email info.getalife@proton.me\n\nGet a Life Paypal donations -\nhttps://www.paypal.me/getalifepodcast\n\nGet a Life GoFundMe-\nhttps://gofund.me/614bcd06\nPayPal link for USA- https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Tz4n35OJ8\n\nRoss Turner GoFundMe- https://gofund.me/390b7528\n\nHeidi McCamley Custody Battle GoFundMe- \nhttps://gofund.me/6711fc74\n\nOlive Leaf Network- https://oliveleaf.network/\nThinking of Leaving Pamphlet and resources - https://oliveleaf.network/resources/\n\nLink to Anchor/Spotify- https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/G6sjHA2xHwb\n\nPreston Down Trust Decision-\nhttp://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/media/591398/preston_down_trust_full_decision.pdf\n\nAberdeen incident- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1riImgAqwaqGwjYq6vRQIr4_jscJA0eQN/view?usp=sharing\n\nIf we walk in the light letters-\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14WlgJladl1r95YGxW0FbZ0prYfjlg7FU/view?usp=sharing\n\nAdmin/Legal email address:\nStouffville-GAL@protonmail.com\nOffice address:\n22 Braid Bend\nStouffville ON\nL4A 1R7\n\n#plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #expose #exposure #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #rules #strict #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #OneSchoolGlobal #OSG  #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #sect #worldwidesect #worldwidecult #cultescape #cultescapestory #bully #bullying #brokenfamily #awareness #cultescape #cultandculturepodcast #cultescapee #cultescapeer #cultescapeeinterview #askingforhelp #unispace",

      "description": "Chris Jones\u2019s last view of God\u2019s Chosen People was from the balcony of the London meeting hall in Park Lane, as the Aberdeen crisis split JND\u2019s famous \u201CMetropolitan\u201D congregation in two, and half the \u201Csaints\u201D stormed out of the hall amid angry recriminations. \nBorn into the well known Barber brethren family, Chris changed his surname to Jones when he left, in defiance of his parent\u2019s appalling mistreatment of him. Intelligent and curious, and with a passion for geology and fossils, Chris found the narrow-minded and coercive Brethren regime unbearable, and his many acts of rebellion as a child resulted in harsh corporeal punishment. \nLeaving as soon as he legally could, Chris worked to pay his way through University, getting a B.Sc. with honors in Geology, and moved to Africa, where he became a  exploration geologist and consultant for gold and platinum mining operations, then took up a teaching career as a lecturer in the University of Limpopo, South Africa. \nChris had resolutely put his dark formative years in the PBCC behind him, and forged ahead with his exciting and successful life \u2013 but on his recent retirement, he came across the Get-A-Life podcasts, and felt a desire to tell his story, and to offer hope, encouragement and help to the current generation of young people trapped inside the narrow walls of the cult. \nAbove all, Chris\u2019 sparkling and warm personality shines out in this podcast, as a testimony to an exciting, happy and successful life that had such a dark and unpromising beginning.\n\nLink for insiders- https://docsend.dropbox.com/view/8nwiat7rwjavnckd\n\nTo share your story or be a guest on the show, email info.getalife@proton.me\n\nGet a Life Paypal donations -\nhttps://www.paypal.me/getalifepodcast\n\nGet a Life GoFundMe-\nhttps://gofund.me/614bcd06\nPayPal link for USA- https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Tz4n35OJ8\n\nRoss Turner GoFundMe- https://gofund.me/390b7528\n\nHeidi McCamley Custody Battle GoFundMe- \nhttps://gofund.me/6711fc74\n\nOlive Leaf Network- https://oliveleaf.network/\nThinking of Leaving Pamphlet and resources - https://oliveleaf.network/resources/\n\nLink to Anchor/Spotify- https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/G6sjHA2xHwb\n\nPreston Down Trust Decision-\nhttp://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/media/591398/preston_down_trust_full_decision.pdf\n\nAberdeen incident- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1riImgAqwaqGwjYq6vRQIr4_jscJA0eQN/view?usp=sharing\n\nIf we walk in the light letters-\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14WlgJladl1r95YGxW0FbZ0prYfjlg7FU/view?usp=sharing\n\nAdmin/Legal email address:\nStouffville-GAL@protonmail.com\nOffice address:\n22 Braid Bend\nStouffville ON\nL4A 1R7\n\n#plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #expose #exposure #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #rules #strict #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #OneSchoolGlobal #OSG  #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #sect #worldwidesect #worldwidecult #cultescape #cultescapestory #bully #bullying #brokenfamily #awareness #cultescape #cultandculturepodcast #cultescapee #cultescapeer #cultescapeeinterview #askingforhelp #unispace",

      "description": "TRIGGER WARNING!\nListen in as 4 Plymouth Brethren \u201Cpriests\u201D subject a lone teenager to a vicious and humiliating hour-long Gestapo-style interrogation.  Never before in the 200 year history of the PBCC has the brutality of the Brethren priests been recorded and made public. For former members, this will be a highly triggering yet deeply familiar experience \u2013 for the public, this will come as a visceral shock \u2013 as the raw cruelty and arrogance of Bruce Hales\u2019 inner circle of \u201Cenforcers\u201D is loudly and clearly exposed. The PBCC \u2018s expensive PR spin doctors have made great claims of \u201Ccompassion in action\u201D and  that \u201Cfamily is at the heart of who we are\u201D. Listen to this merciless assault on both the teenager and his family and judge for yourself how much compassion is shown to a young person who crosses the path of the PBCC elites.\nLead interrogators, Mick Strange and Rod Diplock, multi-millionaire directors of Allfasteners USA and Controltek USA respectively, are also 2 of the 3 directors of \u201CPlymouth Brethren Christian Church\u201D incorporated in Ohio, USA \u2013 placing them at the very top of the Church hierarchy. Strange is a co-director with Gregory Hales in the fixings business, while Diplock has a joint venture in the international property market with Gareth Hales \u2013 Shavano Consulting. As always in the cult, connections with the Hales family, and huge amounts of money equate to absolute power, and the ability to instill deep rooted fear and unquestioning obedience on the long-suffering Brethren congregations.\nAs the interrogation proceeds, the priests in their anger let slip a closely guarded secret \u2013 the name of the man who owns UBT \u2013 the vaunted billion dollar \u201Cfinancial wing\u201D of the cult.\nThe story has a bittersweet conclusion \u2013 the victim leaves the cult and builds a new and very successful life for himself \u2013 but is now estranged from his family who remain under Bruce Hales\u2019 regime of brainwashing and blind obedience.\nFollowing the recording of the \u201Cpriestly\u201D former PBCC members, Cheryl and Richard, review the 4 ingredients that make up a \u201CBruce Hales\u201D priestly interrogation, and  welcome guest, Shanelle, who gives a therapist\u0027s view on the catalogue of religious, emotional and psychological abuse and harm that Brethren victims are subjected to by their leaders. \n\nLink for insiders- \nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/qvyb5tq2r6iew7s8\n\nBooks mentioned-\nThe Body keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk- https://www.besselvanderkolk.com/resources/the-body-keeps-the-score\n\nHealing the Shame that binds you by John Bradshaw- https://www.johnbradshaw.com/books/healing-the-shame-that-binds-you\n\nLink to Steven Hassan website- https://freedomofmind.com/\n\nLink to article \u0022 The Body Comes to Therapy too\u0022 - https://docsend.dropbox.com/view/pyu2mewgfwau7yig\n\nLink to Priestly visit recording for therapists - \nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/2mezj949cdt928gd\n\nLink to Bruce Thompson Freedom Blues song-\nhttps://youtube.com/@bruceybonus7091?si=c455fPvVOCHy19Xz\n\nFreedom Blues link for insiders-\nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/mfig6nncxw3gz4mq\n\nLinks to follow Bruce Thompson-\nInstagram- https://www.instagram.com/brucey_bonus87?igsh=cHJrZTY4bWlrbXAx\nTikTok- https://www.tiktok.com/@brucethompson719?_t=8lyWxbh8feX\u0026_r=1\n\nTo share your story or be a guest on the show, email info.getalife@proton.me\n\nGet a Life Paypal donations -\nhttps://www.paypal.me/getalifepodcast\n\nGet a Life GoFundMe-\nhttps://gofund.me/614bcd06\nPayPal link for USA- https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Tz4n35OJ8\n\nRoss Turner GoFundMe- https://gofund.me/390b7528\n\nHeidi McCamley Custody Battle GoFundMe- \nhttps://gofund.me/6711fc74\n\nOlive Leaf Network- https://oliveleaf.network/\nThinking of Leaving Pamphlet and resources - https://oliveleaf.network/resources/\n\nLink to Anchor/Spotify- https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/G6sjHA2xHwb\n\nPreston Down Trust Decision-\nhttp://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/media/591398/preston_down_trust_full_decision.pdf\n\nAberdeen incident- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1riImgAqwaqGwjYq6vRQIr4_jscJA0eQN/view?usp=sharing\n\nIf we walk in the light letters-\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14WlgJladl1r95YGxW0FbZ0prYfjlg7FU/view?usp=sharing\n\nAdmin/Legal email address:\nStouffville-GAL@protonmail.com\nOffice address:\n22 Braid Bend\nStouffville ON\nL4A 1R7\n\n#plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #expose #exposure #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #rules #strict #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #OneSchoolGlobal #OSG  #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #sect #worldwidesect #worldwidecult #cultescape #cultescapestory #bully #bullying #brokenfamily #awareness #cultescape #cultandculturepodcast #cultescapee #cultescapeer  #unispace",

      "description": "This raw, emotional interview brought us to tears as Cassie Davies and Cheryl Hope witnessed Malcolm Hart share his journey within the PBCC and his exit from the toxic cult. Malcolm pleads to those inside to not follow a man and to be true to yourself. Malcolm was not willing to drop his principles to become rich and asks those inside, \u0022When do you say you got enough? When does money corrupt? You don\u0027t owe BDH anything! You\u0027re not responsible for things that happen to your loved ones, and don\u0027t be afraid to ask questions.\u0022 Choices are important to evolving and understanding your surroundings. When those get taken away- we enter the realm of cult behavior. \nHave your tissues ready as you watch this and let the humbleness of Malcolm\u0027s story and pleas fill your heart.

      "description": "This was a tear jerker episode as \u0022Jane\u0022 continues telling her experience of teaching at OneSchool Global. We hear the all too familiar stories of alcohol and wonder if the PBCC will listen and make changes, especially after the latest car crash that happened, killing 4 people. \u0022Jane\u0022 expresses her concerns on their views of the environment and this leads us into the hypocrisy of their RRT charity that puts a mask on when supporting and pursuing the face of their \u0022charitable\u0022 deeds. She describes the political conversations with these children and knows she couldn\u0027t have taught through another election! \nJane sends us into tears with her message to those that run OneSchool Global. Part 2 of this interview covered absolutely everything that lights a fire under the ex-members to demand change. Our loving families are inside this cult and don\u0027t realize what they are a part of. Will our voices, collectively, be enough to bring change to the future generation? \nWe welcome each and every teacher, those who have worked for the PBCC and anyone who has suffered at the hands of this extremist and destructive cult to come forward and use their voice to bring change.\n\nLink for insiders -\nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/7pmzrj8id688ar5n\n\nTo share your story or be a guest on the show, email info.getalife@proton.me\n\nGet a Life Paypal donations -\nhttps://www.paypal.me/getalifepodcast\n\nGet a Life GoFundMe-\nhttps://gofund.me/614bcd06\nPayPal link for USA- https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Tz4n35OJ8\n\nRoss Turner GoFundMe- https://gofund.me/390b7528\n\nHeidi McCamley Custody Battle GoFundMe- \nhttps://gofund.me/6711fc74\n\nOlive Leaf Network- https://oliveleaf.network/\nThinking of Leaving Pamphlet and resources - https://oliveleaf.network/resources/\n\nLink to Anchor/Spotify- https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/G6sjHA2xHwb\n\nPreston Down Trust Decision-\nhttp://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/media/591398/preston_down_trust_full_decision.pdf\n\nAberdeen incident- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1riImgAqwaqGwjYq6vRQIr4_jscJA0eQN/view?usp=sharing\n\nIf we walk in the light letters-\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14WlgJladl1r95YGxW0FbZ0prYfjlg7FU/view?usp=sharing\n\nAdmin/Legal email address:\nStouffville-GAL@protonmail.com\nOffice address:\n22 Braid Bend\nStouffville ON\nL4A 1R7\n\n#plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #expose #exposure #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #rules #strict #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #OneSchoolGlobal #OSG  #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #sect #worldwidesect #worldwidecult #cultescape #cultescapestory #bully #bullying #brokenfamily #awareness #cultescape #cultandculturepodcast #cultescapee #cultescapeer #cultescapeeinterview #askingforhelp #unispace",

Our anonymous teacher goes through her interview process where she saw many red flags including how these students are not allowed post secondary education. She explains the separation of the boys and girls and her insight into behaviors she witnessed. We hear the heart wrenching story of someone who tried to reach out to a mental health helpline and got into trouble for it. She witnesses how the girls are controlled in their environment and how special friendships are not allowed. Is OneSchool Global too diseased to save or is the foundation similar to their churches? This podcast will have you in tears as Ben and \u0022Jane\u0022 share their experiences. Our only hope is that as these teachers find their courage to speak up, the authorities get involved.\n\nLink for insiders-\nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/mpynqehjfpue29p9\n\nTo share your story or be a guest on the show, email info.getalife@proton.me\n\nGet a Life Paypal donations -\nhttps://www.paypal.me/getalifepodcast\n\nGet a Life GoFundMe-\nhttps://gofund.me/614bcd06\nPayPal link for USA- https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Tz4n35OJ8\n\nRoss Turner GoFundMe- https://gofund.me/390b7528\n\nHeidi McCamley Custody Battle GoFundMe- \nhttps://gofund.me/6711fc74\n\nOlive Leaf Network- https://oliveleaf.network/\nThinking of Leaving Pamphlet and resources - https://oliveleaf.network/resources/\n\nLink to Anchor/Spotify- https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/G6sjHA2xHwb\n\nPreston Down Trust Decision-\nhttp://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/media/591398/preston_down_trust_full_decision.pdf\n\nAberdeen incident- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1riImgAqwaqGwjYq6vRQIr4_jscJA0eQN/view?usp=sharing\n\nIf we walk in the light letters-\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14WlgJladl1r95YGxW0FbZ0prYfjlg7FU/view?usp=sharing\n\nAdmin/Legal email address:\nStouffville-GAL@protonmail.com\nOffice address:\n22 Braid Bend\nStouffville ON\nL4A 1R7\n\n#plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #expose #exposure #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #rules #strict #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #OneSchoolGlobal #OSG  #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #sect #worldwidesect #worldwidecult #cultescape #cultescapestory #bully #bullying #brokenfamily #awareness #cultescape #cultandculturepodcast #cultescapee #cultescapeer #cultescapeeinterview #askingforhelp #unispace",

      "description": "If Part 1 of Neville and Pip\u0027s story didn\u0027t shock you, part 2 will. Neville dives into his mom\u0027s heart wrenching story and how disposable she was to the Exclusive Brethren. Neville walks through the abuse of alcohol in the cult and his conversations he has had with others on this topic. We go through more letters that leave you rocked to the core, especially for the younger generations that didn\u0027t know what all was happening in the 1960\u0027s.\n\nI think it\u0027s safe to say that this cult has diseased roots of power, greed and alcoholism that stem way back. How do those inside watch these podcasts and not get up and walk out? How do we help them see that their faith will follow them and help them through all changes needed to rebuild their lives? If you are looking for stability in your Christian faith, the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church is anything but that! If you want to be tied to a money hungry business man and his minions, the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church will take over your mind, money and life to line their pockets- all under the disguise of Christianity. \n\nIf you are looking to be free of the chaos you are experiencing, there is a life beyond the PBCC cage where you will fully understand what family and faith truly is. Neville provides ample letters, his book and 4 hours of history that we all needed to understand these roots of the Exclusive Brethren/PBCC.\n\nLink for insiders-\nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/qaegz7btqjzxt4in\n\nLink to Neville\u0027s letters/documents/book-\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/unbci6mrz0hdv16iplxnr/ACI4R9c7KO7zx3VxjeARlKs?rlkey=lbe910rez3167edx42navygla\u0026dl=0\n\nArticles regarding Tony McCorkell-\nhttps://www.stuff.co.nz/world/australia/81207610/insider-tony-mccorkell-reveals-secrets-of-the-wealthy-christian-sect-exclusive-brethren\n\nhttps://www.smh.com.au/national/potential-witness-in-exclusive-brethren-sex-abuse-case-paid-to-remain-silent-20171018-gz35mf.html\n\nhttps://natlib.govt.nz/records/23062366\n\nTo share your story or be a guest on the show, email info.getalife@proton.me\n\nGet a Life Paypal donations -\nhttps://www.paypal.me/getalifepodcast\n\nGet a Life GoFundMe-\nhttps://gofund.me/614bcd06\nPayPal link for USA- https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Tz4n35OJ8\n\nRoss Turner GoFundMe- https://gofund.me/390b7528\n\nHeidi McCamley Custody Battle GoFundMe- \nhttps://gofund.me/6711fc74\n\nOlive Leaf Network- https://oliveleaf.network/\nThinking of Leaving Pamphlet and resources - https://oliveleaf.network/resources/\n\nLink to Anchor/Spotify- https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/G6sjHA2xHwb\n\nPreston Down Trust Decision-\nhttp://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/media/591398/preston_down_trust_full_decision.pdf\n\nAberdeen incident- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1riImgAqwaqGwjYq6vRQIr4_jscJA0eQN/view?usp=sharing\n\nIf we walk in the light letters-\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14WlgJladl1r95YGxW0FbZ0prYfjlg7FU/view?usp=sharing\n\nAdmin/Legal email address:\nStouffville-GAL@protonmail.com\nOffice address:\n22 Braid Bend\nStouffville ON\nL4A 1R7\n\n#plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #expose #exposure #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #rules #strict #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #OneSchoolGlobal #OSG  #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #sect #worldwidesect #worldwidecult #cultescape #cultescapestory #bully #bullying #brokenfamily #awareness #cultescape #cultandculturepodcast #cultescapee #cultescapeer #cultescapeeinterview #askingforhelp #unispace",

      "description": "In the next 2 episodes, be prepared to hear history that sets up the toxic behavior we see escalated today, in the PBCC. Neville and Pip McCallum wrote a book called Cast outside the camp that documents the insidious horrors that the Exclusive Brethren are capable of. Neville walks us through their families\u0027 journey, escaping this awful cult. Through his humor and strength to face the cult head on, we sift through letters, postcards, and numerous accounts of how he stood up to them, including a response from BDH himself. \nDid we have a moment in time that history could have been changed? Sitting through this podcast and enthralled at the history generations below  hadn\u0027t heard, Lindy and Cheryl start putting pieces together. What we see today with the PBCC has been building for years, and what Neville informs us of will leave you with your mouth hanging open and light bulbs going off. \nWhat Neville and others started years ago is what the next generation is building off of, but this time with social media that can\u0027t be stopped! THINGS MUST CHANGE! \nEvery generation will do well to read their book, Cast outside the camp, and watch podcast part1 and part 2 to understand, from another perspective, how we got to where we are today.\n\nPodcast link for insiders-\nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/pntivqhkfb3h6myp\n\nLink to Neville\u0027s letters/documents/book-\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/unbci6mrz0hdv16iplxnr/ACI4R9c7KO7zx3VxjeARlKs?rlkey=lbe910rez3167edx42navygla\u0026dl=0\n\nTo share your story or be a guest on the show, email info.getalife@proton.me\n\nGet a Life Paypal donations -\nhttps://www.paypal.me/getalifepodcast\n\nGet a Life GoFundMe-\nhttps://gofund.me/614bcd06\nPayPal link for USA- https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Tz4n35OJ8\n\nRoss Turner GoFundMe- https://gofund.me/390b7528\n\nHeidi McCamley Custody Battle GoFundMe- \nhttps://gofund.me/6711fc74\n\nOlive Leaf Network- https://oliveleaf.network/\nThinking of Leaving Pamphlet and resources - https://oliveleaf.network/resources/\n\nLink to Anchor/Spotify- https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/G6sjHA2xHwb\n\nPreston Down Trust Decision-\nhttp://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/media/591398/preston_down_trust_full_decision.pdf\n\nAberdeen incident- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1riImgAqwaqGwjYq6vRQIr4_jscJA0eQN/view?usp=sharing\n\nIf we walk in the light letters-\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14WlgJladl1r95YGxW0FbZ0prYfjlg7FU/view?usp=sharing\n\nAdmin/Legal email address:\nStouffville-GAL@protonmail.com\nOffice address:\n22 Braid Bend\nStouffville ON\nL4A 1R7\n\n#plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #expose #exposure #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #rules #strict #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #OneSchoolGlobal #OSG  #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #sect #worldwidesect #worldwidecult #cultescape #cultescapestory #bully #bullying #brokenfamily #awareness #cultescape #cultandculturepodcast #cultescapee #cultescapeer #cultescapeeinterview #askingforhelp #unispace",

      "description": "It\u0027s not the money, it\u0027s the LOVE of money that drives the Hales dynasty. Instead of loving people, the Hales are proving to many that they love money more and use their flock to attain their wealth. In this podcast, Cheryl, Ben, and Cassie get into the latest article from Michael Bachelard and Lucy Macken. Is it possible for those inside the PBCC to see where their money goes? Do they know the Hales own these mansions with pools and tennis courts? Everything that is banned for others sits inside the Hales backyards. Ben describes the same year they moved everyone out of Windsor. It was the same year a mansion was bought by the Hales in the same surrounding area. We see it clearly, and so do many who cross paths with them. Inside the cult, it\u0027s a different story. These basic grassroot members believe their money is funding quality education and future generations. This is an extraordinary raid we hope stops the bleeding of the brethren that have no idea what\u0027s going on. What will the ATO find?

Ron Arkcoll, MD of RRT, had both his home and business raided, and files, computers and phones were secured under police guard and removed from UBT HQ for further analysis. \nDamian Hastie, creator of the openandcandid.com investigative platform, sits down with the Get-a-Life team to give us an overview of the staggering wealth of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, and its labyrinth of interconnected businesses, trusts and charities through which billions of dollars are disseminated, ultimately enriching a tiny elite at the top of what Damien likens to a Ponzi Scheme. \nThis podcast includes breaking news from our insider network about the ATO raid that goes well beyond what was reported in mainstream media, and a shocking image of a ritual led by cult leader Bruce Hales in his recent visit to the USA.\n\nLink for insiders-\nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/nnybrvy3fzf9vjuh\n\nLink to Sydney Morning Herald article-\nhttps://www.smh.com.au/national/fleecing-the-flock-exclusive-brethren-businesses-raided-by-tax-office-20240321-p5fe6r.html\n\nLink to RRT Gov handbook-\nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/qhy2fpdb7ux8bfkr\n\nTo share your story or be a guest on the show, email info.getalife@proton.me\n\nGet a Life Paypal donations-\nhttps://www.paypal.me/getalifepodcast\n\nGet a Life GoFundMe-\nhttps://gofund.me/614bcd06\nPayPal link for USA- https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Tz4n35OJ8\n\nRoss Turner GoFundMe- https://gofund.me/390b7528\n\nHeidi McCamley Custody Battle GoFundMe- \nhttps://gofund.me/6711fc74\n\nOlive Leaf Network- https://oliveleaf.network/\nThinking of Leaving Pamphlet and resources - https://oliveleaf.network/resources/\n\nLink to Anchor/Spotify- https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/G6sjHA2xHwb\n\nPreston Down Trust Decision-\nhttp://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/media/591398/preston_down_trust_full_decision.pdf\n\nAberdeen incident- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1riImgAqwaqGwjYq6vRQIr4_jscJA0eQN/view?usp=sharing\n\nIf we walk in the light letters-\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14WlgJladl1r95YGxW0FbZ0prYfjlg7FU/view?usp=sharing\n\nAdmin/Legal email address:\nStouffville-GAL@protonmail.com\nOffice address:\n22 Braid Bend\nStouffville ON\nL4A 1R7\n\n#plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #expose #exposure #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #rules #strict #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #OneSchoolGlobal #OSG  #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #sect #worldwidesect #worldwidecult #cultescape #cultescapestory #bully #bullying #brokenfamily #awareness #cultescape #cultandculturepodcast #cultescapee #cultescapeer #cultescapeeinterview #askingforhelp #unispace",

      "description": "Bruce D Hales - Elect Vessel - Man of God - Leader of the PBCC. But who is the man? How did he climb to such extraordinary heights within the PBCC?\n\nJoin us as we celebrate Get-A-Life\u2019s 100th podcast and extend our thanks to Cheryl, Lane, Carmen and Richard for starting a movement that has escalated in a exponential manner that none of us thought possible. It was their idea to create a safe space to have conversations about our experiences with the brethren. It is a credit to the platform that on this 100th podcast an anonymous insider felt safe enough to join us.\n\nIn just under 18 months the movement has catalogued many harrowing stories, and exposed the many malpractices, harm and detriment caused by the leaders of this cult. The evidence is building through the stories told.\n\nWe probe into the history of the Hales dynasty; a story that dates back to the 1960s. We delve into the accumulation of wealth attached to the family and illustrate the contrast between Bruce Hales\u2019 lifestyle and that of the ordinary members of the brethren.\n\nRelating first hand accounts of interactions with Bruce Hales gives an insight into the character of the man and the ultimate control he has over the brethren.\n\nWhere will it end? How much wealth is enough for Bruce? We speculate on the answer to those questions, but extend an open invitation to Bruce to join us on a podcast to tell us himself.\n\nLink for insiders-\nhttps://docsend.dropbox.com/view/akwiqambx7wryspw\n\nTo share your story or be a guest on the show, email info.getalife@proton.me\n\nGet A Life GoFundMe-\nhttps://gofund.me/614bcd06\nPayPal link for USA- https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Tz4n35OJ8\n\nRoss Turner GoFundMe- https://gofund.me/390b7528\n\nHeidi McCamley Custody Battle GoFundMe- \nhttps://gofund.me/6711fc74\n\nOlive Leaf Network- https://oliveleaf.network/\nThinking of Leaving Pamphlet and resources - https://oliveleaf.network/resources/\n\nLink to Anchor/Spotify- https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/G6sjHA2xHwb\n\nPreston Down Trust Decision-\nhttp://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/media/591398/preston_down_trust_full_decision.pdf\n\nAberdeen incident- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1riImgAqwaqGwjYq6vRQIr4_jscJA0eQN/view?usp=sharing\n\nIf we walk in the light letters-\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14WlgJladl1r95YGxW0FbZ0prYfjlg7FU/view?usp=sharing\n\nAdmin/Legal email address:\nStouffville-GAL@protonmail.com\nOffice address:\n22 Braid Bend\nStouffville ON\nL4A 1R7\n\n#plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #expose #exposure #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #rules #strict #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #OneSchoolGlobal #OSG  #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #sect #worldwidesect #worldwidecult #cultescape #cultescapestory #bully #bullying #brokenfamily #awareness #cultescape #cultandculturepodcast #cultescapee #cultescapeer #cultescapeeinterview #askingforhelp #unispace",

      "description": "Beverly Richardson takes us on a thought provoking journey from the Open Brethren to the Exclusive Brethren. As an only child, when the separation rule came in, it was devastating to lose all her friends. We can see so many of the similarities that are still happening today such as the explicit narratives created to shut someone up, young women having priestly visits alone with men, wills be transferred after someone leaves or gets sick, and the isolation that\u0027s created when a family member gets confined. Thankfully, Beverly had a loving father and mother who allowed her to keep her voice and this may have been the thing that saved her from a life of submission. Join us as Beverly shows us what it is like to use that voice to stand up for ourselves. Also, before this podcast starts, due to recent events, we have some advice to leavers on what these priests CANNOT do.

Meet Sarah - an ex member of the Shanklin Gospel Hall. This small group are believed to be an offshoot of the Exclusive brethren or PBCC as they are now known. Sarah is an author and accredited researcher that has spent much of her time uncovering her own past and the links to spiritual abuse. She has been also diagnosed with autism and goes into her links of abuse with those that are autistic. Elders of this church followed the teachings of JT Jr. The absolute belief that their way is right and any other pathway is darkness will resonate with all ex members of the PBCC and could serve to help those inside to realize that there are many totalitarian religious groups who belief they are the only ones with \u2018the truth\u2019 This coercion, used to uphold this belief, is now acknowledged as spiritual abuse. This type of abuse is becoming more recognized and there is a strong movement adding to the already agreed list of abuses. Join us as we explore exactly what spiritual abuse is and how to spot the warning signs of it.

Craig, Ben, Fritz \u0026 Paul, Stephane, Ross, Jacky, Gilli and Abi navigate a taboo subject that is dealt with in very extreme measures in the PBCC. We know the PBCC is very archaic in their understanding of being born gay, but what will it take for them to realize this problem they have is not going away? The team go through Fritz\u0027s t-shirt he wore to a pride march, that had multiple slogans written on it. Everything that was written on it was said to him by the PBCC. Ben goes through his Instagram posts that had graphic homophobic comments from Steve Hales\u0027 grandson and gives a brief update on his death threat he received. The breakthrough they all had after leaving was finding the support, love and acceptance they never got inside. Breaking free from the narratives, brainwashed into them, was found during meet ups, LGBTQ group activities and realizing how twisted the PBCC use the bible scriptures. Most of all, THEY ALL want to help those stuck inside that are in the same position they were in. At the end of every podcast, there are helplines for those inside to reach out to and everyone here is reachable on social media or at info.getalife@proton.me Your freedom awaits you!

      "description": "One week ago, Russian dictator Vladimir Putin had anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny murdered. Navalny had already been confined to a remote arctic prison, and spend years in detention, much of it in solitary confinement. His crime? He had exposed vast corruption across the Russian elite, describing Russia as ruled by \u0022crooks and thieves\u201D and pointed out the opulent lifestyles of senior officials their vast holdings and luxury property. Now meet Steve Simmons - or perhaps you have met Steve before \u2013 in his podcast that was released just two days before Alexi Navalny\u2019s death. In that podcast, Steve exposed the PBCC leadership as crooks and thieves, and pointed out the opulent lifestyles of senior officials their vast holdings and luxury property. Steve has already spend much time in solitary confinement, deprived of his wife, family, house and every friend in the brethren that he had ever known. He was shut up 4 years ago, then withdrawn from 2 years ago, both on 22nd February. This podcast marks the anniversary of those cruel and unjustifiable actions. The PBCC is currently trying to wrest from him his business and business premises. We will discover in this episode the devious, dishonest and inhumane processes by which Steve is currently being destroyed. The first page of the PBCC website proclaims the following message; \u201CWe endeavor to live in the generous and caring spirit of Christ our savior. Welcome! The Plymouth Brethren Christian Church is a Christian fellowship based on the Holy Bible as the Word of God. We invite you to learn more about our faith, our beliefs, values and our way of life.\u201D So let us take that invitation, and learn a little more about the Exclusive Brethren - by listening to Steve Simmons on Get-A-Life Podcast #95.

Our anonymous guest from Canada takes us on her journey to finding her freedom and support outside the toxic culture of the PBCC. Craig and Ben join in our discussion of their shared experiences leaving the PBCC due to the unaccepting views on anyone associated in this community. (Jenny) reads her letter of goodbye to her parents and we discuss the lack of education and understanding about sex and homosexuality in these communities that has led to rampant misconceptions, fixation on sexual relationships, and deep-seated guilt and shame.  The podcast also revealed the struggles faced by teachers within these communities. They feared repercussions for speaking out against racism and homophobia, leading to a high turnover of teachers. The impact of a fear-based stance on the entire community is truly sobering. LGBTQ\u002B individuals deserve acceptance and understanding, not discrimination and fear. It\u0027s time to create supportive, inclusive environments and find ways to help them understand that you cannot pray the gay away!

      "description": "TRIGGER WARNING- Discussion and videos on animal abuse.  One of the strangest and saddest features of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church is its appalling record of cruelty to animals. From slaughterhouses where live pigs are dropped to boiling water, to using SUVs to ram and run over kangaroos, to the mindless torture of cats, chickens and small wild birds and animals - the PBCC does it all - and apparently takes great pleasure in it.  It all started with a great slaughter of pets in the 1960s, when James Taylor Jr, the alcoholic leader of the cult decreed that animals were \u0022unclean\u0022 and were used by Satan to take our affections away from God. Within days of this pronouncement, tens of thousands of cats, dogs, rabbits, birds and other creatures were drowned, beaten to death or if lucky, euthanized.  Hear accounts from PBCC leavers who were traumatized as children by this callous genocide of pets.  Then it get worse... Hear One School Global teachers describe how their students delighted in cruelty to animals, and how they had to bring in speakers from animal cruelty charities to try and help them. Hear how the prominent and extremely wealthy Bruce Hazell tormented birds and rabbits in PBCC priest Oliver Woodcock\u0027s backyard. We hear how young brethren attending Bible readings, and actually staying in the house with Global PBCC leader Bruce D Hales would spend the time between church meetings \u0022Roo bashing\u0022 including running over and fatally wounding mother kangaroos with joeys in their pouches. Finally, in a filthy m\u00E9lange of religious hypocrisy, homophobia, political corruption and cruelty to animals, the story of the execrable Roger Unwin\u0027s Tasmanian pig farm. We end this podcast on a light note with funny videos and pictures of ex-members sharing their beautiful moments with their pets. link for insiders- https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/kpam18misb353m5g88p4a/Get-A-Life-podcast-on-Animal-Abuse.mp4?rlkey=vsnfw567a5plno6d925y7d6th\u0026dl=0  Link to Cat hit with arrow article- https://au.news.yahoo.com/mount-barker-man-faces-court-after-cat-shot-in-head-with-arrow-35973868.html  Article on OSG teacher/PBCC and animal abuse- https://faithschoolersanonymous.uk/2016/06/exclusive-brethren/  Slaughter house articles- https://www.farmtransparency.org/media/41-slaughterhouse-owned-by-controversial-exclusive-brethren-leader-under-fire-corruption-animal-abuse  https://www.farmtransparency.org/editorials/331-scottsdale-pork-pig-slaughterhouse-intersection-political-corruption-bigotry  https://www.instagram.com/p/C1-v6UXuEpy/  https://www.instagram.com/p/C2CUX58JStA/?img_index=1  Animal cruelty, pet abuse \u0026 violence: the missed dangerous connection- https://medcraveonline.com/FRCIJ/animal-cruelty-pet-abuse-amp-violence-the-missed-dangerous-connection.html#:~:text=Animal%20abusers%20are%20more%20likely,as%20having%20Antisocial%20Personality%20Disorder.\u0026text=Those%20who%20engage%20in%20animal,%2C%20and%20drug%2Fsubstance%20abuse.

      "description": "magine scars of abuse that run so deep the story moves us all to tears. As our special guest Mick Dover shares the story of his childhood stained with abuse from members of the very church he was brainwashed into believing must be accommodated and respected at all costs. The families that make up the hierarchy of the PBCC in Melbourne, Australia- the Bakers, McAlpin, Cox,  Gadsden, Grace, Joyce, John, Jensen, Nipper, Hales, Dover and the list goes on had best sit up and listen as Mick explains the complete lack of safeguarding and cover-up of every kind of abuse imaginable. A 7 year old child thrown through a metal reinforced glass shower door because he walked in on his father \u0026 another spinster from the PBCC in bed together.  Late night priestly visits that turn into a big drinking  conversation, the story so bone-chilling and yet the members of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church had the audacity to attempt to recruit Mick \u0026 Debbie to rejoin the church in what appears to be an attempt to further keep a lid on the abuse. How many more victims might there be of this horrendous childhood rape, sexual trauma, physical abuse, and religious coercive brainwashing?  **TRIGGER  WARNING:  DISCUSSION OF SEXUAL ABUSE, PHYSICAL ABUSE, AND SUICIDAL IDEATIONS. **",

      "description": "When Martina\u0027s parents, Jerry and Alona Lyons, decided to finally leave the toxic cult of the PBCC, she was only 15. Martina shares with us her struggles of finding her feet in the outside world but most of all she shares her incredible life she has now. Martina attended the PBCC school, OneSchool Global (OSG) and suffered horribly on so many levels from the bullying, mistreatment and lack of care that we often hear about. Once she got herself situated in a public school, she excelled in every aspect that OSG had failed her.  Martina\u0027s journey extends beyond education. She shares the impact of therapy and the healing process after leaving the cult, emphasizing the importance of seeking support and cutting off negative influences. Martina highlights the value of family support, finding happiness in extracurricular activities and the therapeutic bond with animals. The conversation also delves into Martina\u0027s hopes for her future child, the opportunities and freedoms she looks forward to providing, and her embrace of new experiences outside the constraints of her upbringing.  Martina\u0027s unwavering spirit reminds us of the power of choice, resilience, and the pursuit of a life filled with love and purpose. Her story is a reminder that there is always light at the end of the tunnel.

Leave the brethren and speak out and you are not allowed a meaningful relationship with family in the brethren. It seems to make no significant difference.   It does seem, however, that speaking out publicly results in having the added label of being an \u2018opposer\u2019 and the brethren pray for your \u2018removal\u2019 because of the \u2018poison\u2019 we speak.  What is an opposer? Why are we labelled as such? How is this label fueled among the brethren? What are our motivations for speaking out on a public forum? Lindy Jacomb joins the UK team to unpack this label and the implications of it. Join us as we delve into the brethren mindset towards \u2018opposers\u2019 and discuss the real fears the brethren hold towards speaking to such people.   Take heart as we explain our motives for having public conversations about the brethren and share the emotion at the end when Lindy reads a poem about how it feels to be regarded as an opposer by those you love.

His hard work, research and perseverance sparked the interest of the leading Canadian investigative podcaster Canadaland, leading to the R*******r podcast series that exposed Gerald Chipeur, Brad Mitchell, and Warrick Fentiman well deserved national public humiliation, and also inspired Carman, Cheryl, Lane and Richard to launch a new podcast channel dedicated to former member\u2019s stories; Get-A-life Ex-cult Conversations.\nIn this episode, we ask James what motivated him to target the PBCC, then we take a trip down memory lane, reviewing the remarkable series of interviews that Blackballed conducted \u2013 many of them shocking and tragic, some humorous and heartwarming and some just very bizarre\u2026\n\n\n\nDROPBOX LINK FOR INSIDERS-\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/spituh4tgldgr56ztcqjd/Get-A-Life-podcast-with-James-Difiore.mp4?rlkey=dnjqmobxx7jkf32gb2amnhl74\u0026dl=0\n\nLink to Blackballed podcast- https://youtube.com/@Blackballedwjamesdifiore?si=npFTQzFMC0p1PKgv\n\nTo share your story or be a guest on the show, email info.getalife@proton.me\n\nLeavers GOFUNDME support-\nhttps://gofund.me/5582d1f3\nPayPal link for USA- https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Tz4n35OJ8\n\nOlive Leaf Network- https://oliveleaf.network/\nThinking of Leaving Pamphlet and resources - https://oliveleaf.network/resources/\n\nPreston Down Trust Decision-\nhttp://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/media/591398/preston_down_trust_full_decision.pdf\n\nAberdeen incident- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1riImgAqwaqGwjYq6vRQIr4_jscJA0eQN/view?usp=sharing\n\nIf we walk in the light letters-\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14WlgJladl1r95YGxW0FbZ0prYfjlg7FU/view?usp=sharing\n\n#plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #OneSchoolGlobal #bully #bullying",

      "description": "As Aberdeen becomes a hot topic inside the PBCC, we created a podcast for insiders to access relevant information to help you come to your own conclusion on what really happened. If you haven\u0027t watched Episode 82 with Drue Wiggins, watch that one before this podcast. Bradley McCallum encourages listeners to make their own decision about this evidence and allow the discussions to happen.

      "description": "The Aberdeen scandal was portrayed as a \u2018test of the fellowship\u2019 to those inside the brethren. Yet ,some who were close to those involved, witnessed the build up to the events of 1970 and were not in the least surprised when the scandal became public.  Drue Wiggins was one of those people. Join us as she talks from the diaries that she kept from her time in the brethren. She describes how she witnessed first hand behavior\u0027s that came to a crescendo at Aberdeen.   These events ultimately lead to Drue packing her bags and leaving the brethren resulting in her losing all contact with her parents.   This conversational podcast gives further insight into a pivotal moment in PBCC history. How has this era of history influenced the PBCC as we know it today?  Has anything change?

      "description": "Get A Life shares the captivating story of Tom Grace from Adelaide, Australia who left the Exclusive Brethren at age 17 in 1970, after the Aberdeen incident. His raw, authentic vulnerability shines through as he recounts what it was like to make that decision after his parents decided they were done. After leaving, he walks us through what it was like, as a group of ex-exclusive members went back to the fundamental teachings of JT Sr., much like the Renton branch.  After joining his family\u0027s building business, Tom\u0027s career took off. He started his own successful building company, became a scuba diving instructor, dabbled in underwater photography, and even had a deep desire to study law.  Attending a motivational seminar, Tom was inspired to pursue his dream of becoming a lawyer. Writing down his goal of becoming a lawyer in 10 years, he broke it down into smaller steps, including getting a law degree. Tom\u0027s journey of rediscovery didn\u0027t come without its challenges. The scars from leaving the religious group haunted him, leading to PTSD. But therapy and self-reflection helped him find clarity and embrace his choices.  Tom\u0027s determination paid off as he pursued his law degree, faced rejections, and eventually got accepted into law school. He started his law career at the age of 43 and today, he\u0027s recognized as one of South Australia\u0027s top lawyers in construction law. Through his story, he encourages others to reevaluate their choices and find the courage to pursue their own paths. Tom shares his experience of finding genuine love, care, and community outside the Exclusive Brethren. From sports clubs to his own law firm, he emphasizes that a sense of belonging and support can come from various sources beyond the group\u0027s confinement. This story is one that will warm your heart, bring tears to your eyes but most of all inspire us to make the most out of the freedom we gain after leaving the brethren.

      "description": "Older brethren look back on the 1950s as the Golden Age. No UBT, no OneSchool, no 6am suppers, no meeting every night, no mandatory \u201Cvolunteering\u201D for Campus\u0026Co, no separate tables, no shunning of your nearest and dearest, no headscarves, just a dazzling array of fancy hats, and those manly suits and ties for the brothers.   Today, Get-a-Life brings you a STUNNING REVELATION. There is a parallel universe in which the 1950s peebs still live their happy and carefree lives. Like Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb, or Jurassic Park, the Renton fellowship of Plymouth Brethren have frozen time, and neatly sidestepped the grievous plagues and curses that the evil \u201CBig Jim Taylor\u201D inflicted on the saints. And there is more \u2013 we can reveal that it is actually the Rentons, and not the PBCC, that is the TRUE position, holding the standard while the rest of us poor buggers stumbled around in the dark. Too good to be true? \u2013 probably, but you can judge for yourself in this surprise-packed interview with ex-Renton brother and Poet Laureate, Paul Flowerdew. Paul Left the Renton\u0027s to gain freedom for his family, just like those of us that left the Exclusive Brethren/PBCC. Tune in to hear the similarities and the differences.

      "description": "In this podcast, we explore a deeply significant issue within the PBCC: Alcohol dependency and addiction.  Join our UK team as they share personal connections to this subject. Ross, a recovering addict, and Abi, the child of an addict, bring a unique perspective to our discussion.  We\u0027ll dive into four essential questions that anyone in the PBCC should contemplate to assess their relationship with alcohol:  Do you fear a life without alcohol? Have you struggled to control your alcohol consumption? Do you wonder if you can enjoy the PBCC lifestyle without alcohol? Have you used alcohol to cope with emotions and stress?  These questions serve as a mirror to our own experiences, prompting self-reflection and awareness. We\u0027ll also shed light on the concerning levels of alcohol consumption that persist within the PBCC community, and the root causes of this.   Join us as we unravel the impact of toxic levels of alcohol consumption within the PBCC, especially amongst the younger generation. We ask the question everyone is thinking...if Bruce Hales quit drinking and looked at his usage of alcohol, would others follow in his footsteps? With the PBCC community so locked in on their Man Of God, could he be the person to turn these horrible tragedies around?

Despite the graves being old they are still treasured by locals who have family past buried there.  Imagine the shock of the locals when one day in July they found some of the headstones had been removed, graves had been dug over and a gravel drive had been laid on top of them  A local resident, Jackie Davies, describes the campaign she has led to expose the inhumane behavior\u0027s of the new owners of the site - Dolafon Gospel Hall Trust, a trust belonging to the PBCC/Exclusive Brethren. Jackie also talks about the unanswered questions of building plans not being available and planning permission being passed without complete transparency of process   \u2018Even when we\u2019re wrong we\u2019re right\u2019 is a phrase used by the PBCC and the attitude of disdain Jackie was subjected to by members of the PBCC certainly upheld this arrogant statement.  Will the PBCC do the right thing by offering a full apology and rectifying the graveyard to its original state or will their entitlement shine through and just do the bare minimum to avoid publicity?

From a woman\u0027s shelter to a home she has for herself now, Ailsa shares valuable insights and offers guidance to those who may be in a similar situation, and proves it is possible to escape; not just a cult environment, but also an abusive and controlling relationship. She goes through step by step of what you need to make this escape possible. An incredible story of overcoming adversity to live a fulfilling life outside of a cult.

      "description": "Following the PBCC\u2019s planning route in Chicago, they published an unprecedented \u201Cad hominem\u201D attack on former PBCC member and whistleblower Richard Marsh \u2013 who they blamed for their defeat. Here is what they had to say:  \u0022The instigator of the attacks on the Area N project is Richard Marsh, who left the PBCC years ago after he killed a mother of three in a car crash, for which he was criminally charged: Read Story. The courts have confirmed that Marsh is a liar. He has been sentenced to prison in his home country (England) for his repeated contempt of court. Click to read the details of the court judgments against Marsh: Decision 1 and Decision 2.\u0022  Who is behind these multiple court cases against Richard, and what was the purpose of them? Is Richard a fugitive from justice? A wanted criminal? A murderer? Or is this all a desperate attempt to silence a whistleblower who holds the receipts that connect Bruce Hales and his family to a shocking medical scandal? This episode unfolds a sordid tale of greed and corruption within the PBCC, led by fake \u201CCambridge Graduate Microbiologist\u201D Warrick Fentiman, and ably backed up by Bruce Hales in person. The King\u2019s Lynn business Specialist Hygiene Solutions (now re-branded as Inivos) launch Deprox, a miraculous new invention that gives a \u201Cmillion-fold reduction\u201D in hospital room germs \u2013 but is it REALLY as safe and effective as they claim? And why would Fentiman and the PBCC spend millions of pounds on court cases in the UK and Canada in desperate efforts to silence a former employee who worked on the Deprox project?

The battle of Barrington ended in a resounding victory for the residents as the PBCC fled the field in disarray. Never a cult to accept defeat graciously, they then lashed out at their critics in a series of newspaper articles, social media posts and a dedicated website. Having told the Barrington Residents a month ago \u201CWe long to become your neighbors\u201D the PBCC now accuses them of \u201Cshameful behavior\u201D and \u201Creligious bigotry\u201D, and claims that the opposition to their giant 2000 seat meeting hall, school and superstore was \u201Cinstigated by CONVICTED LIAR Richard Marsh\u201D. Lynette Diener, Get-a-Life\u2019s indomitable representative in Illinois was on the spot with her camera at the fractious public meeting where the conflict reached its dramatic conclusion \u2013 making for a truly riveting podcast!

      "description": " It\u2019s a blast from the past as the original founding podcast team of Cheryl, Carman, Lane and Richard get together to celebrate Get-a-Life\u2019s first birthday. Reviewing our year of podcasts, we realized that almost every aspect of the PBCC that we looked at involved the mistreatment and humiliation of women \u2013 so we made this today\u2019s theme.  We look at how women and girls are controlled and oppressed in the PBCC under the pretense of \u201Cfollowing scriptural principles\u201D and show how women even in bible times were accorded much greater respect, power and opportunity than they are under Bruce Hales\u2019 regime. We trace back this distain and male entitlement to the extensive physical abuse meted out on numerous Brethren women by the so called \u201CElect Vessel\u201D James Taylor Jr, and have some shocking eye-witness accounts of his predatory and disgusting behavior. On a more positive note, we reveal the stunning statistics that show the incredible number of views from all over the globe that Get-a-Life has received, and give the top 5 cities around the world for views. A big thank you to ALL our viewers, and our message to Bruce \u2013 if you think we are running short of ammo, think again. We are just getting started! Our goal will always be to save our families in there, from your doctrine.

      "description": " Dr Alex Stein is a social psychologist who specializes in cults and totalitarian groups. In this podcast Alex describes her own experience of being involved in a political cult and the difficulties she had in extricating herself from it. Alex talks us through the emotions experienced when wanting to leave a high control group and describes how support with doing so is vital. She discusses avenues of support and how finding the right type of help is important to aid coping outside when leaving such groups. Totalitarian groups such as the PBCC use the same coercive tactics to control their members as individuals in controlling relationships. Alex explains how this needs to be stopped through the law if possible. She discusses a report published in 2022 that calls for ways in which to amend to law to protect people from controlling groups in the same way individuals are protected in a close personal relationship.This podcast is a must listen for anyone inside the PBCC who has doubts about the regime controlling their lives and who might want to break free.

After arriving in Victoria, Julie was told she would be going home with The Buck family. For the next 2 years, she describes being separated from her parents, her brother and from everything she knew.  It was never explained to her- what happened on the ferry that day that caused her parents and brother to turn around and go back and she would spend the next 2 years wondering.  When her mother returned to the meeting two years later- it was without her father and Julie describes growing up in a PBCC \u201Cbroken family\u201D.   Julie also shares her recent experience losing her young daughter, Haven, to a very aggressive, invasive cancer.  We are so proud that Julie spoke out to help others understand how destructive the hierarchy is inside the PBCC.  When you would expect compassion and fatherly love she received judgement and disdain.  How has that affected her and what scars does she carry?

      "description": " Anna Simmons lived her whole life in the Exclusive Brethren/PBCC, but never agreed with their harsh doctrine of separation. She was unable to leave because of her family, but spent years having secret contact with relatives on the outside. In one letter she said she had \u201Cfelt trapped for most of my life\u201D, and she also said she felt like a \u201Cprisoner of hope\u201D.  Many people who have left or are thinking about leaving the PBCC will relate to this quote from Anna: \u0022CAN I continue where I am, wearing the mask of conformity, and rebelling within?\u0022  Anna died last week aged 85, the day Bruce Hales arrived in New Zealand for the infamous Palmy Party. It was bad timing for the Brethren! You see, Anna was the grandmother of Lindy Jacomb and Braden Simmons, and great-aunt of Craig Hoyle - three of the biggest \u201Copposers\u201D in New Zealand these days. So what was going to happen at her funeral?  In this surprising podcast, Lindy and Craig reveal how the Brethren compromised on all of their usual burial rules, and even allowed a completely \u201Cworldly\u201D funeral service to be held for her in a non-Brethren chapel. Here at Get A Life we\u2019re hopeful that this sets a precedent for how Brethren funerals will be conducted in the future. Have a listen! We also give a Palmerston North update!

With over 8000 members and many highly successful businesses, the PB Kiwis have considerable soft power within the \u201Cecosystem\u201D \u2013 yet they have never produced an universal leader. Is the harsh and increasingly eccentric reign of brash Australian Bruce D Hales going to be the last straw for the beautiful islands of Aotearoa? Are they preparing to throw off the chains of Hales and go their own sweet way? Was the Palmy Party a desperate, last ditch attempt to woo them back into Bruce\u2019s sweaty embrace?

Now retired, he lives in a beautiful 1765 red granite \u201Claird\u2019s house\u201D in the Cairngorm mountains of Scotland, owns a small fleet of vintage cars, hosts the annual Lonach Highland Games on his estate, and enjoys occasional visits from King Charles III who lives nearby at Balmoral. This successful and fulfilling life had a most tragic and unpromising start when at 17 young Richard was ejected from his parent\u2019s house and forced to fend for himself in a caravan (travel trailer) \u2013 due to the cruel edicts of JTJr \u2013 his only crime being that he disagreed with the doctrine of separation.

      "description": " Have you ever wondered- how accurate all the stories told to us and shared with us are? In this episode, we share pieces of a JHS documentary that rewrites history into lies. History is about understanding facts and learning lessons of what not to do and the mistakes that should never be repeated. What then, when we find a group claiming to be a \u0022Mainstream Christian Church\u0022 and we discover them making their own documentaries to sell to their people and they have rewritten history, altered facts, and whitewashed the lessons of past tragedy. On this podcast, being we had the certified facts and were alerted to the dishonesty, we have dedicated this time to share the PBCC version vs the actual facts.  The problem with them rewriting history - making it sound prettier, not as nasty, not as bad, - is that in addition to being offensive and inaccurate, it inflicts harm on victims that have lived through the terrible tragedy in the first place and then are forced to stand up again and say- ENOUGH!! This is a warning for all PBCC members- check the stories you are being told; the facts are being altered and the storyline is changed.  The lessons that should have been learned and etched in our hearts are been whitewashed with waves of false retelling.

      "description": " Residents of the Chicago suburb of Barrington turned to the Get-a-Life team for help when the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church came to town. The secretive cult is trying to secure a 32 acre site in Barrington for a huge complex of a 2000 seater hall, a school and a superstore. Rather than make an honest approach, we believe that the PBCC corrupted two Barrington Park district Councilors with offers of multi-million-dollar realty deals to induce them to push through the sale of the site at a fraction of market value. The PBCC then sent a delegation to the public meeting about the land who lied egregiously about their intentions, and the capacity of the proposed room. Watch Steve Johnstone and Dale Diener fumble their way through a highly charged meeting of Barrington residents. We can\u0027t quite figure out why they were chosen for this - maybe it could be that Dale Diener was a former employer of Unispace and his direct connection to the Hales team placed him there?  Get-a-Life was represented at the meeting by Lynette Diener \u2013 a Chicago resident and former member who has been quietly helping the team for over a year.  When the public meeting erupted in protest, the PBCC them tried to push the sale through BEFORE a scheduled second meeting at which the issue was to be decided. Barrington residents legally blocked the sale, whereupon the PBCC hired a top flight lawyer specializing in religious freedom to fight their case\u2026meanwhile a public protest was held, with \u201CNo PBCC\u201D posters and placards, all filmed by national news networks on the ground and from a helicopter. The drama continues, but here we present the first of two or more podcasts that take you right to the front line of the fight against this insanely wealthy and ruthless cult. We added the updated survivor video as a harsh reminder of the mess the PBCC leave in it\u0027s trail.

      "description": " The Plymouth Brethren Christian Church plan to build a 17,000sq ft church, plus a school and superstore in Barrington IL, a suburb of Chicago. here a former member of the PBCC explains exactly what a PBCC \u0022church\u0022 will look like, and exposes the PBCC representative Dale Diener\u0027s lie that the capacity of the hall will be only 1000 persons. We also get a tour inside a PBCC meeting hall and the reason for the mysterious sliding doors and outsize A/C units is explained.  We go on to look at Bruce D Hales\u0027 ministry, and explain what \u00224 square feet per person\u0022 means in the context of a 17,000sq feet hall. We look at the \u0022circus tent\u0022 outside a Manitoba PBCC hall, and explain that with each giant \u0022city hall\u0022: the PBCC build, there will be several smaller \u0022local\u0022 halls required.  We look at how the PBCC regard their neighbors, and using quotes from their own printed literature, expose the two-faced way in which they seem to offer a friendly hand while despising and hating non-members as \u0022worldlies\u0022. PBCC Campus\u0026Co superstores like the one proposed usually contain a well stocked liquor store. Are the brethren really planning to put a liquor store and a school in the same building? We look at how the Brethren rationalize and excuse using lies and deception to obtain what the church needs from the \u0022hostile\u0022 world, which it regards as satanic.  Any community faced with the prospect of the Plymouth Brethren seeking planning permission for a \u0022Gospel Hall\u0022 needs to study this video carefully.  *Note 1. All ministry quotes are from Subject Index to the Ministry of B D Hales, Copyright Bible and Gospel trust 2014.  *Note 2. Correction: The A/C units in the 17,000 sq ft room shown are not the size of a semi-trailer - they are about 8\u0027 x 27\u0027 - more the size of a  school bus.#plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #OneSchoolGlobal #bully #bullying #meetingroom #meetinghall   ",

      "description": " TRIGGER WARNING- Suicide, self harm, abuse  Join the Get A Life team and our special guest Tiffany as she shares her story, beginning at the age of 6 and continuing through to the present time. A story of callous, brutal, unchristian treatment dealt out without any regard to the feelings and damage being done to a young girl.   Tiffany describes in her own words, how demonstrably more terrible bullying is at the all brethren school, than even the public school she attended prior. The complete lack of any safeguarding policies and the lack of a channel of open communication with a hurting and abused young lady. The complete lack of discipline in the school towards the bullies and even the lack of teaching around bullying and how it hurts others is a common issue we hear that goes on inside OneSchool Global.   Probably, one of the most horrific parts of her story is the details around the brethren stepping in and creating fictious reports and stories so to take complete custody of her child. She shares the abuse she endured from her multiple moves she was forced to do, as she was shipped from home to home. Our message to every mother in the PBCC is very clear- DO NOT allow your child/teen to have priestly visits with men by themselves.   We commend Tiffany on her bravery and courage stepping forward and sharing her story. We know that each survivor story paves a path out of this Hitler like authoritarian cult.

      "description": " In February 2009 The Preston Down Trust applied to the Charity Commission of England and Wales to renew its charitable status.  In June 2012 the Charity Commission rejected this application on the basis the doctrines and practices of the PBCC as practiced by the Trust did not meet the test for public benefit as set out in charity law. This resulted in a hearing being scheduled in the First Tier Tribunal so the courts could decide if the PBCC practices and doctrines met the legal threshold for charitable status. That hearing never went ahead.  Join us as we explore what happened as a result of the 2012 decision and unpick exactly what the Charity Commissions concerns were, especially in relation to the reports of detriment and harm resulting from the practices of the PBCC. Regulators are there to give guidance about change and this is what the PBCC assured the Commission they were willing to undertake in order to retain their charitable status. The formal agreement for change happened in 2014.  But have the PBCC changed? Has the detriment and harm to both their members and ex members stopped? If you think not, we explain exactly what you can do about it to call for a review of the charitable status of the PBCC . link to Preston Down Faith in Practice document -https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/336112/preston_down_trust_full_decision.pdf Link to Charity Commission complaints form-https://forms.charitycommission.gov.uk/raising-concerns/ Contact us at info.getalife@proton.me for information on how you can come on and share your story Current GOFUNDME needs Julie Fletcher\u0027s Daughter- https://gofund.me/a9da51dd Heidi McCamley trial- https://gofund.me/5582d1f3paypal  link for USA- https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Tz4n35OJ8 Olive Leaf Network- https://oliveleaf.network/ Thinking of Leaving Phamplet and resources - https://oliveleaf.network/resources/Link to Anchor/Spotify-  #plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #oneschoolglobal   ",

Behind the veneer of military orderliness and impressive campus buildings, she shows us an ugly culture of unchecked bullying, misogyny, racism and homophobia. She talks about the evidence she saw of marital abuse in the parents, and how it was universally understood by the teaching staff that if they reported signs of sexual abuse to the authorities, or raised questions about the hierarchical bullying, they would be \u201Cdisappeared\u201D.   Former MET/OneSchool student Ben Woodbury, who suffered sexual abuse and bullying at the MET/OSG campus gives us a student\u2019s perspective and in a heartfelt appeal, pleads with OneSchool teachers globally to report abuse to government accredited authorities, regardless of the personal cost.   For OneSchool Global students, their teachers represent their only point of contact with the real world, and their only possibility of escaping from the culture of abuse and concealment within the cult.

In Part 2 a former teacher from OneSchool Global explains the legal imperative on teachers to report signs of child sex abuse to the proper authorities, the racist harassment that non-Caucasian teachers suffer in the schools, and the racial slurs that are the norm for PBCC students.  Next, we discuss the ban on University education and the narrow minded obsession with commerce that cripples the potential of the students. Finally we look at some reviews of One School Global posted by teachers on recruitment websites, and some pearls of wisdom from cult leader and \u201CMan of God\u201D Bruce D Hales.   We extend an invitation out to all OSG teachers that are currently working or have worked, to come on and share their stories to help these children that have no choice in the life they\u0027ve been imprisoned into. In our society, any other culture that displayed this behaviour, would be unacceptable- why is it tolerated within the PBCC?

Sarah describes what happened to her and how she and her family were so harshly dealt with just because they asked if someone could join the brethren to be with her.  Sarah tells us of the treatment her father received at the hands of the brethren and how this contributed to his nervous breakdown. She speaks emotionally of how she was denied the chance to pay her respects to her father after he passed away. Sarah\u2019s story will resonate with many ex brethren as we all have lived experience of their behaviour. But others who haven\u2019t experience such behaviour, may be shocked at the harm and suffering caused just because an outsider wanted to join this church. It gives weight to the conclusion that outsiders are not welcome in the brethren.   The brethren claim to be a \u2018Mainstream Christian Church\u2019.

Abi and Anne sit down with the founder of Something To Say, Jeremy Indika, who dives into his pursuit of bringing a very taboo subject to the public in any way he can. Jeremy, being a survivor himself, offers advice to the current systemic sexual abuse inside the PBCC. Jeremy\u0027s passion of his mission, \u0022to get this subject on everyone\u0027s table because this is everyone\u0027s concern\u0022, shows in his ability to articulate what each of us could do to help and the different angles sexual abuse needs to be looked at.

      "description": " In 2014, The PBCC in their charity commisions review declared that they would allow outside members to join and attend their meetings. Emily Victoria gave up her friends, family, got rid of her TV, jewelry, wore dresses and headbands and sincerely wanted to join the PBCC and reunite with her boyfriend that wanted to marry her. Unfortunately, she was denied in every way and cut off of contact from the love of her life. Could it be that her boyfriend\u0027s family was looked down on or was it the sneering priests that thought she was a joke? Either way, the PBCC are showing the public they aren\u0027t holding to their agreements they laid out with the Charities Commision. Join Emily as she shares her meeting with the priests, screenshots of their messages and heartwrenching audio of her emotional pain after being denied what she wholeheartedly gave everything for. Can the Charity Comission hold the PBCC accountable for their misuse of their charity status? We certainly hope so!

      "description": "Trigger warning-Discussions on suicide   A drastic look from an outsiders perspective while working at UBT, Floss learned very fast where she was on the PBCC hierachial system. In her year working there, she could not understand how awful this \u0022Christian\u0022 group was to humans. She met with Bruce Hales a few times and he referred to her as a whore to her face. Forced to wear long skirts and stockings, Floss describes the UBT workplace as a culture dominated by bullies that have little or no respect for women. Listen in as she details the alcohol abuse, homophobia, misogyny, hypocrisy and bullying she endured that took 2 months to even stand back up from. This podcast is absolutely full of shocking information-shared from an outsider, who was kind enough to share her experience in the hopes of educating others to avoid being exposed to this workplace environment.

      "description": " In 1978, after the Jonestown massacre in which 900 people died, police searching the cult\u2019s compound found tens of thousands of doses of mood altering drugs, both legal and illegal, that were used to control members who were considered to be insubordinate.  We have long been aware of the extensive abuse of prescription drugs by the brethren\u2019s \u201Cin-house\u201D doctors to dope and medicate troublesome cult members \u2013 including the illegal and brutal attempt by Australian PBCC doctor, Mark Craddock at \u201Cconversion therapy\u201D in which he tried to chemically change a gay member in to a straight one, using the chemical castration drug, Cyprostat.  Could the brethren sink any lower?  Yes, they can and did. Get-a-Life hears the story of Todd Coulter, who was \u201Cprescribed\u201D Cyprostat for years, at his own expense, by Detroit brethren doctor Phil Truan. The doctor admitted that the drug was illegal in the USA, and arranged to have it shipped direct to Todd from the UK. After years of obediently taking the drug, Todd developed painful lumps in his breasts, requiring expensive surgery.  What was the justidication for this drastic and illegal medical intervention? Listen to this shocking episode to find that out \u2013 and much, much more.

We dive into the concerns and questions that every parent should have in any schooling system. Why would a school go through 6 principles in 5 years? What is Massimo Introvigne, a well known cult apologist and scholar of Satanism, doing at a Christian school that believes in keeping seperate from evil? Why would teachers find alcohol in water bottles in grade 7 \u0026 8 and changes not made? We have firsthand reports of disappeared fellow staff members being one of the most demoralizing thing about working for the PBCC school system. We hear of a kinder teacher candidate recgonizing and calling out signs of sexual abuse in little children with nothing being done about it. We also dive into how the Frank news reported on the latest accident in Australia.What would you expect a mainstream Christian Church, that separates itself from the evil of the world, to be like?

      "description": " Malcolm Rawlings and his young family were wrongly excommunicated in the 1970s. For 28 years, the family kept faith with Brethren doctrine, practicing separation and holding church meetings to the brethren calendar as a household. In Maple Creek, the brethren acknowledged their wrongdoing and the family, now with married children and with grandchildren, were readmitted to the fellowship in Maple Creek, Canada.The reward for this extraordinary but misguided faithfulness? The families were bullied, shredded, divided between different continents, and some members were excommunicated all over again.Fergus Howard, Malcolm\u2019s grandson was caught in this turmoil from a young age. As an \u201Coutsider\u201D in the Maple Creek congregation, he was subjected to horrific bullying. When his parents relocated to Worcester, UK, it got worse \u2013 much worse.This is just the prologue to over a decade of physical, psychological, and spiritual abuse that Fergus suffered at the hands of the PBCC. Finally Fergus discovered a message that Bruce Hales had sent to his priest:\u201CHe is thoroughly bad. Leave him to stew in his own juice\u201DRejected by his family, the brethren, and the so called \u201CMan of God\u201D, jobless, penniless and stranded in a cheap hotel in a foreign country, Fergus rebuilt his life, from nothing, step by step.The brethren claim to be prodigies of \u201Ccare and compassion in action\u201D. This harrowing account proves just how false and wilfully deceitful those words are.

What unfolded on that day was unexpected. Join us as we discuss Rowan\u2019s recollection of these unusual and completely unexpected events.

At some point in the mid-1980s, Roy approached his father with one of Ken\u0027s sons present, with a proposal - a large parcel of farmland had come up for sale - if JHS would give him the money, Roy would buy the farm andf pass it on to Ken\u0027s children to give them a secure future. What happened to that farmland, and to the charge JHSymington laid on Roy and his brothers to care for Kenny\u0027s family?  In a powerful and heartfelt narration Kenny\u0027s daughter, Carman challenges her uncles Walt, Vern, \u0026 Ron and the leader of the PBCC, Bruce D Hales to respect and honor the wishes of James H Symington and his dear wife and to reverse the wicked theft, and injustice that has been done.

However, Dean Wheelers\u2019 parents left the PBCC and he was born outside of it. His father rejoined when Dean was 11 years old and gained custody of his three sons. Dean describes how alien it was to suddenly have to conform to PBCC rules and way of life after having a childhood of freedom. He recounts how doctrine enforced on him resulted in a religious trauma that took him years to work through and the difficulties he had in doing this.

We merge 2 podcasts together to discuss the hierachy within the PBCC. Abi takes us through an in depth look at how this \u0022mainstream Christian church\u0022 runs as a business that seems to only benefit those at the top of this ecosystem. She walks us through a chart that was literally created by the PBCC and through emails that show their true colors. After watching this, it really does confirm, in black and white, where their priorities are. It definitely doesn\u0027t seem to be on the welfare of their congregation and teachings of the Bible. Where does this business seem to be heading as a \u0022Mainstream Christian Church?\u0022 Hopefully, those inside will see that money is the root of all evil and the freedom out here doesn\u0027t need that kind of wealth to be a heartfelt and compassionate Christian.

She thought she would be safe there, but the moving around started, and after many attempts of obtaining help from the so called, \u0022Man of God\u0022, Abi found that, devestatingly, this was not the case.

A sympathetic work colleague covered for him at work as she insisted that he went to see a Doctor.  As Murray shares what led up to that final breakdown and how this resulted in him leaving the brethren, we see yet another family divided by the brethren doctrine of separation. Murray describes how he tried to continue to see his children, and up to a point was successful in doing so \u2013 until recently.   Murray gives some excellent advice on how to protect your mental well being when leaving the PBCC by finding like minded friends as you navigate the transition into non PBCC life.

Stephen Gear had to do just that when he left the control of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC) in order to preserve his mental well-being. Many who have left this group will empathise with the deep sadness having to make that choice brings. Stephen shares how he found kindness outside the brethren when he needed it most. He describes how he tried to return to the brethren and was prevented from doing so by one person. Did that person have an ulterior motive for keeping Stephen from the family he loved?

The punishment: excommunication and shunning by her entire family, friends and everyone she had ever known. This is the incredible story of Lindy Jacomb \u2013 who having rebuilt her life from scratch after her devastating excommunication, set her heart on helping others so that no one will ever have to face that experience alone and afraid again. Lindy walks us through the Olive Leaf Network website; a charity set up to help those affected by high demand religious groups.

One of 10 children raised by an authoritarian father and a mother driven to the depths of despair by mistreatment and bullying, Cassie was on the verge of marrying a young brother she barely knew, when she was struck by a conviction that she needed to leave the controlling sect and end the generational curse of spousal coercive control. One of the most riveting podcasts we have experienced, and an incredible story of how a single moment of enlightenment saved a young woman from degradation and made her the thriving success that she is today. Even though this is a 2 hour podcast, it\u0027s full of wise, sage advice from a woman who has seen and heard more than her share. Sit back, take it in small chunks and realize why Ben and Cassie are the perfect fit to open their arms to their Australian podcast.

He tells a story of bullying through his teenage years and the worthlessness he felt as he realised that he would never fit into the community he was born into. The manner which Fritz describes how gradually contact with his much loved family ceased will strike a chord with many others that have left. He talks candidly about how he has gained confidence as a person after leaving, and shares with us an incredible creative talent that would never have been nurtured within the brethren. This story is a testament to anyone that there is kindness and love in this world and the freedom to be yourself is liberating.

Here he gives a summary of the results to date of his comprehensive review of Brethren business and family wealth in the UK. Here on Get A Life we have repeatedly said that the brethren collect far, far more money than they could possibly spend on their schools - but we never had any hard numbers to back up this assertion - until now!  Damian gives us a mind blowing account of just how much money the wealthiest families in the brethren are making, and just how little of that wealth it would take to run the entire OneSchool system.  The burning question is - where does all the money go?  Listen in on conversations with ex-cult members. As we dissect the hidden lairs within these cults, we reveal the real trauma that goes on behind closed doors.   #plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #oneschoolglobal  ",

      "description": " TRIGGER WARNING This podcast contains discussions about suicide. Viewer discretion is advised  Join us as we explore with Ross Turner how it feels to be in the brethren and gay. Ross describes how he was told therapy sessions would \u2018make him straight\u2019 and how he had to deal with the feelings of worthlessness not only because he was gay but also because he had been born into a community who would never accept him the way he was. He recounts the effect this attitude had on his family and speaks with emotion over how he was not able to even say goodbye to his Mother. His story demonstrates the controlling methods employed by the brethren to try to make someone conform to their ways, and how that sent him into a mental spiral of addictions to try to cope with the pressure. Nine years later, Ross has overcome these additions and has found freedom in life with his partner. Ross finishes with a heartfelt message for anyone in the brethren who is gay.

The perverted reasoning behind the eviction order, and the glib lies used to cover it up are so ultra-cultish it makes Scientology look like the Woman\u0027s Institute Knitting Circle.  Ben also drops his own insights in to who will be the Mog when the current Mog meets his maker.  You might get a surprise here!  listen in on conversations with ex-cult members.

      "description": " Michael Bachelard is Bruce Hale\u0027s nemesis. Having blown the cult\u0027s appalling history of political, financial and sexual crime wide open in numerous newspaper articles and the famous book, \u0022Behind the Exclusive Brethren\u0022. He then added insult to injury by not being struck by lightning, dying of leprosy or succumbing to any other curses that the ever vengeful cult expected a wrathful God to smite him with.  In fact, as you will see, he looks remarkably cheerful.  Michael reveals some eye-popping details about the late Tony McCorkill that will have Bruce frothing with rage, scoops some particularly mephitic dirt on the late unlamented Dr. Kirkpatrick, and gives some titillating inside information on how he has pulled the wool over the brethren\u0027s eyes.  He\u0027s led them up the garden path and left them up the creek without a paddle.   #plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #oneschoolglobal  ",

      "description": "Listening to the Sydney Seminar recordings from our insiders brought to light how far away from Christianity the PBCC really have gotten. Their ruthless account for time and money is at the forefront in every aspect of their life. The \u0022Great Men\u0022 have replaced any bible teachings and the younger generations are being taught relentlessly to find a way to connect to these men. You will hear how apparent their heirarchy is and how much hypocrisy \u00A0there is when you read their lying rebuttals and comments they give to the media. We correct an imperative mistake in their math equation on how many of them are in the world. The Sydney Seminar was a revival of the system days which held all the same content on being a high acheiver and how to be accountable for every minute of your day to BDH. In their eyes, Men only need 6 hours of sleep, women need 7 and pigs need 8! Yes you read that right! Pigs need 8. This podcast reveals the true nature of why their business is doing so well. It is not a Christian Church....it is simply a business system. You will not find Christianity is any of their top leaders- but I can guarantee you, there are plenty of good Christian Churches out here that would leave you melting in your seat with love and compassion. \u00A0 Link to Care meeting transcript referred to in podcast- https://drive.google.com/file/d/17Iu50Jh5DYSXsAa0hA0_B8VTGeD9fRIC/view?usp=sharing\u00A0 Contact us at info.getalife@proton.me \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 #plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #oneschoolglobal",

      "description": "Could you imagine waking up one morning and being told not to come to a church service and then finding out after someone had the power to play God with your life? Our guest Rob McLean lost his wife, 6 children, grandchildren and his business in a blink of an eye due to a priest that had it out for him. He was withdrawn from through the letterbox for asking a question about Aberdeen. \u00A0The real reason was due to Rob making a comment in regards to Bruce Hales and it was reported to him. \u00A0When Rob was in a larger community, he kept his head down and made the best of his life that he could. He had to transfer to a smaller community and that\u0027s when things went south. You will hear how dangerously horrific and evil this system is and how they take out Christ in every way and replace it with Bruce. Our hearts broke as Rob walked us through his recovery from alcohol from being in the brethren and how the medication Naltrexone changed his life. We dive into the situation well known to the ex brethren community when Braden Simmons had his house raided. Rob, living there at the time, shares the ferocious antics of the PBCC. After watching this podcast, you\u0027ll realize that somehow- we need to stop this bullying that destroys families! Noone should have the power to tear families apart. \u00A0 Contact us at info.getalife@proton.me \u00A0 #plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #oneschoolglobal",

Numerous newspaper articles and TV programs have exposed the ugly mysogeny and homophobia that OneSchool Global has tried to hide from the Swedish public - taxpayers who are unwillingly funding this cult school - despite the fact that the PBCC businesses are extremely wealthy, and the brethren live in grand mansions in the most exclusive suburbs. \u00A0Tina has accomplished all this on her own - with only about 700 brethren in Sweden, the number of ex-members is also very small. We salute her courage and invite her to join our international team of truth-tellers! We also hope her families success in gaining freedom inspires others inside to know they can walk away as a strong family unit. \u00A0 Link to articles- https://www.facebook.com/groups/348557787039157/permalink/618027146758885/ https://www.facebook.com/groups/348557787039157/permalink/618031100091823/ https://www.facebook.com/groups/348557787039157/permalink/617267953501471/\u00A0 Email info.getalife@proton.me for more info and to send your stories in. \u00A0\u00A0 #plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #OneSchoolGlobal #Bullies #Protecttheteachers #Strive23",

Imagine the realization that a group that calls itself a church, so abusive and horrific that one must be partially drunk to sit through their meetings! Maple Creek, SK has been a PBCC group marked with hardline religious abuse, emotional abuse and has had constant huge losses of their young people. Could this be the key why? We hear Jen read a letter of her father\u0027s describing what he witnessed in his last 5 years of being in there, not ever being able to forget. Tracy recounts his parents being told that if he was dead- at least they would know where he is and Dennis informs us how Alan Drever had access to him. Our hearts break at the inaction of the past from the PBCC in Maple Creek and how they continue to turn a blind eye to the horrific abuse and generational trauma that happened.

Not a single one of those students will attend university. (Even the Taliban allows some university attendance - but not the PBCC) Shockingly, many of these schools in Canada and Australia are government funded. \u00A0Higher education is only one of Oneschool\u0027s problems. A culture of bullying is endemic to PBCC schools, and we release audio of a secretive cult broadcast called \u0022Strive 23\u0022 in which an anti-bullying program is proposed. We also look at Oneschool from the perspective of teachers, who often have terrible experiences. When we look at online reviews for Oneschool \u00A0on recruitment sites, the one observation that appears again and again is \u0022Colleagues simply disappear overnight\u0022.

Listening to how she was labelled psychotic and had her children taken away is heart wrenching and shows how the gaslighting of the PBCC can make a mother question everything. Thankfully, Ros got some help from within the school and got free. Unfortunately, the person who helped her was suspended. We hear how much her child was bullied at the PBCC school and how free and happy her children are now. We hope this story really shows that ALL spouses can break free of the bondage the PBCC put on marriages when they want them to stay separated. \u00A0 Link to the news article that was written anonymously regarding Ros and her family-\u00A0 https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/mum-three-brainwashed-cult-who-17628561?utm_source=linkCopy\u0026utm_medium=social\u0026utm_campaign=sharebar\u00A0 #plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #gaslightingawareness",

Could it be that the doubleminded PBCC filed a report agreeing that families had the 100% right to decide whether or not to socialize with their ex-pb families? But then why would that not happen? Oh right?

We review from the beginning of the year how this Mainstream Christian Church is anything but MAINSTREAM. All links to the articles are listed on our Youtube channel so you can keep up with why we are fighting so hard for this to be exposed. In less than 2 hours, you will be astonished this group can even legally consider them a Christian Church and hold a charitable status. Richard even pulled out the JND Bible to show viewers how Stephen Harper\u0027s was actually a PBCC bible. He lets us in on the conversation that was had when he was inside regarding the gifting of this Bible to Stephen Harper.

Do they choose the word of Bruce over the teachings of the Bible? Do they believe they are the only ones with special light while labelling themselves a Mainstream Christian Church? If King Lemual was not supposed to drink because he\u0027s a King and leader, how is it that Bruce Hales feels comfortable drinking excessively as leader of the PBCC group? The Bible tells a husband to love his wife as Christ loves his assembly-does that condone a husband tossing his wife down the stairs? Did you know that in Bruce Hales\u0027 eyes, if you\u0027re not prosperous-God is not with you?? Join our discussion with special guest Peter Hart as we breakdown some of the fallacy taught to PBCC members.

She unpacks the myths of there being not much trauma in that generation and gives us a descriptive understanding of the power they used back then. She reveals her horror of why she asked to break bread. The importance of the PBCC history she shares, shows us how deep the implicit indoctrination affected that generation. Jill\u0027s journey into a psychology degree got her deep into the research of trauma that ex-members go through after leaving. She takes us though some of that research and we see through her very descriptive graphs the difference between the general population and an ex PBCC member. We get into a deep discussion on finding the right therapies and therapists. We are very curious as to what has worked for you and how did you get to a place of regulation after leaving? We are super excited to have Jill back on to discuss various therapies that have worked and what hasn\u0027t worked for ex-members.

He walks us through his struggles with mental health inside the PBCC and his visits to the brethren approved therapist Dr McPhillips who we find out took his own life. Braden explains the famous story of being told to drink cyanide or eat rat poison. Braden Simmons helps us dissect the RRT Charity set up by Bruce and his minions as a tax shelter and the salvation of the group\u2019s charity tax status. When you strip off the PBCC fa\u00E7ade and realize it\u2019s nothing more than another antic to keep money in Bruce\u2019s pockets you will share our disgust! We discuss the coercive control used on members in every aspect of their lives, the political deception hidden from many of the members and the new Strive 23 program the PBCC are launching in hopes of generating an extra 90 million dollars to line the already bursting church coffers. \u00A0#abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam",

When the meal is finished Bruce resumes drinking double scotches neat until time to leave to go to church for the evening service. Could it be the well-known leader of this cult also leads his flock in the vast consumption of alcohol that is so harmful to so many?

What she witnessed and endured left us speechless. She dives into the mistreatment of woman and how it keeps being accepted generation after generation. Will the PBCC ever realize the amount of abuse that occurs inside their cult? Will they take heed from those of us that had to endure it and make changes? We also clear up the rumor of us being paid to talk! #plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #RRTcares",

We reminisce on what it was like when we first left and how we created our new social circles. We take a peek inside Lane\u0027s documentary from 2015 as he tries to join one of their meetings and is denied access. Listeners get to hear how the elders talk to those of us that leave. We walk down memory lane since leaving and in a much lighter conversation, we relish in the blessings we\u0027ve claimed since leaving and the freedom we feel now.

      "description": "***This episode contains discussions about suicide. Viewer and listener discretion is advised.*** Walk with us as our special guest Christine describes her experience working for a multitude of different PBCC companies. Her astute observation of the disgusting treatment of women- often treated as second class citizens, or as lesser humans is so spot-on with what so many of us who have left the PBCC have described. Christine was never a PBCC member so it is enlightening to hear her describe the abundant use of alcohol by very young children, the attitude of young PBCC men in the workplace and the huge pay discrimination between members \u0026 nonmembers. Not a shock to ex-members of this cult but a huge shock to those who have never had this first hand experience.

She recounts how she tried to get help regarding her abuse and how she was even sent to Maple Creek! At the time Lara\u2019s abuse was happening there were 23 members and of those there are potentially 10 children as victims of sexual abuse. She takes us through what it was like to be a female within the church and how \u0022women were slaves\u0022. Her heart wrenching story on the day she left, brought us all to tears as we all knew of the pain she described. We dive into the leaders promise of the rapture and the lies covered up during a split in the 60\u0027s called Aberdeen. Could this have been the open door for abuse to be so widely accepted? Cheryl also gives us an update on the investigation in Maple Creek.",

The PBCC will not allow its members to vote, and claim to have no interest in politics. Indeed, as a registered charity, they\u00A0cannot legally engage in political campaigns. We peel back the veneer of lies to show how the PBCC\u00A0 has become by far the most influential cult in Canadian politics, using its members to give targeted donations to political causes on demand, and how they were intimately connected with Stephen Harper\u0027s election campaigns. We also give you a heads up on Jesse Brown\u0027s new podcast series \u0022Ratf*cker\u0022 which will be a fruitful romp through the legendary \u0022Klondike papers\u0022 leading on to the even darker crimes committed in Maple Creek.",
