      "title": "Who is UAE billionaire in the Epstein files? | MEE Live",
      "description": "US Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the justice department (or DOJ)\u2019s handling of the Epstein Files during a congressional hearing on Wednesday. It descended into a shouting match.\n\nAt the heart of the dispute was the DOJ\u2019s extensive and often erroneous redactions in the 3 million Epstein Files released last month\u2013 and their decision to withhold three million more.\n\nOn Monday, three US lawmakers were given access to unredacted files for the first time. They left with searing criticisms about what had been redacted. Specifically, the identities of powerful men.\n\n\u201CIf we found six men that they were hiding in two hours,\u201D Khanna said in a speech to the House of Representatives on Tuesday, \u201Cimagine how many men they are covering up for in those three million files.\u201D\n\nLater on in the show we\u2019ll be speaking to survivor advocate Janey Starling about what the files spell out about gender justice.\n\nFirst, MEE has been looking into one of the \u201Csix men\u201D mentioned. An Emirati billionaire linked to the highest levels of the UAE state. \n\nAfter seeing the unredacted files, Republican congressman Thomas Massie wrote on X:\n\n\u201CUntil tonight no one knew who sent the torture video to Epstein\u2026 our law requires VICTIM\u2019s information to be redacted, not information of men who sent Epstein torture porn!\u201D\n\n\u201CThe torture video\u201D he refers to was a cause for disturbance after the original release included an email sent from Epstein in 2009 saying \u201Che loved the torture video\u201D. The recipient had been redacted.\n\nMassie claims the sender of the torture video was Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem.\n\nIt\u2019s a name that comes up in the Epstein files more than 5,000 times. The material does not demonstrate criminal wrongdoing and Sulayem has not been charged with a crime. But it is enough to cause serious potential problems not just for Sulayem himself, but one of the biggest cargo companies in the world\u2013 as well as the United Arab Emirates.\n\nSupport stories that matter.

      "description": "Why are America\u2019s super-rich backing Tommy Robinson? \n\nRobinson - real name: Stephen-Yaxley Lennon - is the UK\u2019s best known Far Right influencer.  \n\nHe\u2019s attempting a glossy re-brand from \u201Cfringe extremist with a criminal record\u201D to a self-styled \u201Canti-Islam citizen journalist\u201D with the ability to command large - sometimes violent - crowds.\n\nThat transformation is - in part - being turbo-charged by millionaires and billionaires in the United States.\n\nIn this two part special we profile Robinson\u2019s rise and his relationship with the world\u2019s richest man Elon Musk. \n\nBut first, we reveal the Conservative US pro Israel backers boosting his operation.\n\nSupport stories that matter.
