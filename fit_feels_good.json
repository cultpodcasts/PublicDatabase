      "description": "Let\u2019s have a light chat about cults with LaNisa Frederick.\n\nShe\u2019s an award-winning actor, writer, content creator, voiceover artist and black survivor of Doomsday Cult, WorldWide Church of God. \n\nLet\u2019s get the lay of the land. What exactly is a cult? You might find isolation, charismatic leaders, financial arrest, and consequences for leaving, but LaNisa\u2019s experience and research say time and society are the judge. \n\nSo anything can be a cult? These days, language is tricky, but there doesn\u0027t have to be an extreme and devastating end to make it a cult. \n\nI even had my eyes opened to the existence of a diet cult! Woah who knew Jesus said you had to be skinny? \n\nSpeaking of the variety of cults out there, it\u0027s important to note that no one wants to join a cult. Vulnerabilities, life circumstances, and different origins contribute to everyone\u0027s story. \n\nLike LaNisa says, even though black and brown experiences aren\u2019t often talked about, \u201CIt\u2019s not just white people shit.\u201D. \n\nDuring our conversation, you can\u2019t help but laugh. LaNisa wants to open the discussion of black and brown cult experiences with comedy.\n\nLaughter is a source of healing and by using comedy, LaNisa can heal AND teach\n\nTune in to the full episode for more about LaNisa\u2019s story and be on the lookout for when comedy and Cult stories will collide with LaNisa\u2019s podcast, Black and CULTivated, coming September 2024.\n\nWhat\u2019s Inside:\n\u2014What\u2019s a cult? And can virtually anything be one?\n\u2014Opening up the conversation about black and brown cult experiences.\n\u2014Surviving the WorldWide Church of God while black.\n\u2014What draws people into cults? \n\nMentioned In This Episode:\n\u2014LaNisa Frederick (@lanisafrederick) \u2022 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lanisafrederick/\n\u2014HASHTAG BOOKED (@hashtagbooked) \u2022 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/hashtagbooked/\n\u2014Black and CULTivated (@blackandcultivated) \u2022 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/blackandcultivated/\n\u2014Transform Your Body \u0026 Habits In 28 Days.
