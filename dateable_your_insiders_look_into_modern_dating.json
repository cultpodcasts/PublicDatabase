      "description": "What happens when the sexual wellness community you\u0027re part of starts to feel like a cult? We\u0027re chatting with Rebecca, who is still coming to terms with her experience with orgasmic meditation and the organization OneTaste, which got profiled in the Netflix documentary Orgasm Inc. We discuss what attracted her to the practice in the first place, the tipping point of when this experience started to not feel right, and how she\u0027s recovering from the disturbing allegations vs. missing the woman she was at this time.
