      "description": "Join Founder \u0026 Executive Director Naomi Wright, author/apologist Lindsey Medenwaldt, and Board Chair Natasha Fish as we dig into a recent cult that\u0027s been gaining traction. Like many unhealthy religious groups, the leader proclaims to be a prophet and uses her spiritual authority for her personal gain. But the unique aspect of this group is that adopting cats is a key tenet, as they ascribe to the belief that the animals are critical to their salvation from the impending apocalypse. Come with your questions and to hear about common threads between this group and others!",
