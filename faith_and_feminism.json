Those who don\u0027t understand deconstruction may seek to condemn it, but Brooks shows us that deconstruction is nothing to fear--indeed wrestling with faith is something we see God\u0027s people do throughout Scripture. With in-depth Biblical study, modern-day narratives of people of faith, and an understanding of cultural evangelical conditioning, those who deconstruct will feel seen and validated. As Brooks suggests throughout her book, perhaps deconstruction is not the end, but the beginning of living authentically in our relationship with God",

Did you know that about 20 million women in the US deal with an eating disorder at some point in their lives? Women are constantly judged by our bodies, whether they are big or small. Whether or not men would rate us as attractive. If that pantsuit was the best idea for the business presentation. And the constant critiques we get of women running for political office for the way we look. I do not know a single woman who has struggled with body image. I guess that shouldn\u0027t be surprising given the culture we were raised in. So... let\u0027s change the culture by being radically accepting and loving towards our bodies.

This week on the podcast, I got the amazing opportunity to talk to Rev. Sarah Heath about singleness and life and how sometimes it can be really hard not to compare your life to others. We talk about this concept of sonderlust, of how everyone\u0027s life seems to be so wonderful, while yours can just feel stuck. In this episode, we dissect how to be grateful in the life you have. If you\u0027re single, married, divorced, or engaged, this podcast can help you be grateful, right where you are. I hope you check it out.",
