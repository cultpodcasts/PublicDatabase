      "description": "Re-airing our most downloaded episode from our Vanishing Father\u0027s Series \u201CTo be a father was my way of breaking a cycle and starting over.\u201D In this one sentence, today\u2019s guest, Peter Gronvall, insightfully reflects on his journey to fatherhood after growing up in a cult. - During his conversation with host Jamie Truman, Peter discusses his experience living in two distinct worlds: One world where he and his eight siblings were subjected to severe emotional and physical abuse, and another where he was a dedicated student and spent time with friends. He shares how he and his siblings persevered through these painful years, and the impact on his relationship with his parents. - Remarkably, Peter didn\u2019t let his experience derail his aspirations. He earned a full scholarship to college and then got accepted into Yale Law School, all the while being a source of support to his siblings. Most importantly, he became the type of father he always wanted: nurturing, empathetic, and protective. - Tune in to learn more about Peter Gronvall and how he survived growing up in a cult. - Purchase Vanishing Fathers 100% of the proceeds go to charity that help at-risk youths Connect with Jamie at Truman Charities: Facebook Instagram LinkedIn Website YouTube Email: info@trumancharities.com This episode was post produced by Podcast Boutique https://podcastboutique.com/",
