If this is a literal story, how can god be good? From the trauma of my religious upbringing to my art therapy sessions (yes, I painted the Flood), we\u2019ll break down Genesis 6-8 and explore the morality, science, and symbolism of this story. \n\nHow does a supposedly \u0022good\u0022 God justify wiping out the entire world\u2014humans, animals, and all\u2014with a flood? And why does this story still hold so much weight in fundamentalist circles? Let\u2019s question the narrative, dissect the theology, and challenge the notion of blind faith. Which Bible story made you rethink your beliefs?\n\n00:00 god did this...\n01:42 poetry vs literalism\n02:12 why did you leave?\n03:52 others = evil\n05:34 god can regret?\n06:31 what did the animals do?\n07:28 we are animals...\n08:21 perfect little noah\n09:17 pot calling the kettle violent\n10:54 anti-life god\n12:17 creation museum and arc experience\n16:03 old old man noah\n19:18 Library Art Classes\n21:01 The Chosen One...\n24:01 take a penny, leave a penny\n25:22 the animals would go extinct... with only 2 left\n26:26 you = evil\n27:25 gods emotional blackmail\n28:48 Be Skeptical\n29:28 Future Plans\n\n\uD83D\uDD14 Don\u2019t forget to like, subscribe, and hit the bell for more critical takes on faith, morality, and religion!
