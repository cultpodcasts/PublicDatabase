      "description": "What\u2019s it like to doubt the beliefs of the strict religious community you grew up with? What\u2019s it like to leave? Where do you find the courage and strength to make that choice, and to adapt to your new life? Director Scott Homan and writer and musician Ryan Sutter have lived these questions, and collaborated to tell the story in the new documentary, Witness Underground. The film focuses on Ryan\u2019s love of music and the musical relationships within the Jehovah\u2019s Witness community that sustained him as a teen and gave him a safe place to land when he left.
