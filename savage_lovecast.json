      "description": "Happy New Year, and a very happy Feast of the Ass to you and yours. In honor of the holiday, our first caller asks if he should keep a cup of mouthwash handy for when he moves from ass-eating to pussy-eating. A man wants strategies on how to talk his sister out of circumcising her newborn son. On the Magnum, Dan chats with Ellen Huet, a plucky, investigative journalist who uncovered an exploitative sex cult that revolves around female orgasm. Her book EMPIRE OF ORGASM about OneTaste, a sexual wellness company is amazing, and she and Dan had a LOT to talk about. And, a poly woman wonders if when making introductions, she should reveal the poly status of two friends, so they know they are all \u201Cin the lifestyle.\u201D Q@Savage.Love 206-302-2064 This episode is brought to you by Squarespace.
