      "description": "Peter Young shares the true story of how a cult leader wrecked his life. In this cautionary tale, he reveals red flags to look for in spiritual leaders, characteristics of a cult, and how to know if your loved one is involved in a cult. He discusses the impact of isolation, fear, and manipulation that destroyed his marriage, his relationship with his kids, and his health. And through the conversation, Kelly makes a stunning comparison between cults and critical race theory (CRT). \n\nAuthorPeterYoung.com\nhttps://www.authorpeteryoung.com/\n\nBook: Stop the Tall Man, Save the Tiger\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Stop-Tall-Man-Save-Tiger/dp/B0BW384Q2W\n\nMusic by Dmitry Taras from Pixabay\nMusic by Oleksandr Stepanov from Pixabay",
