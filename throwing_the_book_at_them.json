We also looked at the Sir Richard Branson connection and the PR advised he was giving to Epstein. \n\nWe also discussed the China role in all of this and the news that Andrew met President Xi on many occasions, with birthday letters to Xi drafted by alleged Chinese spy Yang Tengbo. \n\nThere is a huge amount to process so we will be covering all of this in much more detail in next week\u2019s episode. \n\n00:00:00 Introduction \u2013 the new Epstein releases\n00:00:29 Sarah Ferguson\u2019s closeness to Epstein\n00:01:01 Case for sex trafficking charges\n00:01:34 Trafficked women at Buckingham Palace\n00:02:07 Scale of Andrew\u2019s use of prostitution\n00:03:12 Weinstein, the Yorks, and Hollywood\n00:04:16 Beatrice, Eugenie, and Epstein\u2019s access\n00:05:57 How Ferguson used royal properties\n00:06:49 Starmer, Congress, and reopening investigations\n00:07:12 Andrew as trade envoy \u0026 misconduct in office\n00:08:33 China, Pitch@Palace, and alleged spies\n00:10:30 Ferguson emails \u0026 sexualised language\n00:12:26 Intelligence links: Mossad, CIA, kompromat\n00:13:16 Branson, Gates \u0026 rehabilitating Epstein\n00:15:06 Peter Mandelson \u0026 cash-for-access\n00:16:32 Tony Blair, Kazakhstan \u0026 legal pressure\n00:18:06 Stain on Queen Elizabeth II and King Charles\n00:19:24 The cover-up becomes the story\n00:21:06 What Charles could do now\n00:22:05 Why the Met Police failed to act\n00:23:45 Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s central role\n00:24:37 Why Andrew is finished\n00:25:22 Robert Maxwell, KGB \u0026 early intelligence links\n00:26:36 Putin, Russia \u0026 long-term kompromat\n00:27:52 National security implications for Britain",

We also discussed the truth behind the Melania and Epstein connection. \n\nWe also discussed why Epstein\u0027s friends looked past his conviction for procuring a minor and why he was so intent on trying to bring down President Trump and why he was ultimately unsuccessful. \n\nMichael has bravely taken on Melania Trump in a lawsuit that sees him taking action where many far more powerful news organisations seem content to not upset the President and his wife.
