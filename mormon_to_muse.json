      "description": "Have you ever noticed how leaders\u2014religious, political, or otherwise\u2014use \u201Cus vs. them\u201D language to stir emotions, create loyalty, and shut down critical thinking? In this episode of Mormon to Muse, I break down how this kind of rhetoric works, why it\u2019s so effective, and the impact it has on individuals raised inside high-demand systems.\n\nI share examples from Mormon leaders, extremist religious figures, and even both major U.S. political parties to show just how universal this tactic is. You\u2019ll see how the same phrases that once felt \u201Cfaith-affirming\u201D are actually manipulative tools designed to create fear, division, and unquestioned loyalty.\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Learn in This Episode\n\n\nWhy \u201Cus vs. them\u201D language is emotionally powerful but logically empty\n\n\n\nHow political and religious leaders use this tactic to control narratives\n\n\n\nThe psychological impact of always viewing outsiders as dangerous or wrong\n\n\n\nWhy recognizing these patterns is a critical step in reclaiming your own voice and agency\n\n\uD83C\uDFA7 Listen and subscribe on Apple Podcasts\u00A0\n\n\uD83D\uDCFA Check out therapeutic art prompts on\u00A0YouTube\u00A0\n\n\uD83D\uDCE9 Join the Sunday Muse newsletter for weekly inspiration: Subscribe here\u00A0\n\n\uD83D\uDCF7 Follow me on Instagram\u00A0 for behind-the-scenes art and reflections\n\n\n\nArticles referenced in this episode:\n\nPsychology Today\u00A0\u00A0The Psychology of Us vs Them\n\nWeb MD What is the Us vs Them Mentality?\u00A0\n\n\u00A0\n\n\u00A0\n\n\u00A0\n\nWhile this isn\u2019t art therapy, and I\u2019m not a licensed therapist, these creative exercises have been powerful tools for healing in my own life and in the lives of women I work with.",

      "description": "Generational pain is real. Many of us carry not only our own struggles but also the unhealed wounds of our mothers, grandmothers, and the women who came before us. They were taught to endure, to stay small, to sacrifice themselves, and often to silence their own needs. Without realizing it, we inherit those patterns. But the truth is: the suffering doesn\u2019t have to continue through us. We have the power to say the line ends here.\n\nIn this episode of Mormon to Muse, I explore what it means to break the legacy of suffering and create something new.\n\nTogether we\u2019ll look at: How generational pain is passed down\u2014silence, shame, and submission.\n\nWhat it looks like to honor the women before us while refusing to repeat their suffering.\n\nHow creativity, voice, and courage can help us heal and rewrite the future.\n\nPractical steps you can take to consciously choose what gets carried forward and what stops with you.\n\n\u00A0\uD83D\uDC49 Join my Sunday Muse newsletter for more inspiration: Subscribe here",

      "description": "Leaving or deconstructing a faith system doesn\u2019t just change what you believe\u2014it changes how you relate to the people you love. Whether it\u2019s family who remain devout, a spouse who doesn\u2019t understand your journey, or friendships that once revolved around shared beliefs, relationships can feel like the hardest part of faith transition. In this episode of Mormon to Muse, I explore why relationships are impacted so deeply when your faith changes\u2014and how you can navigate that shift with more clarity and self-trust. Drawing on life coaching tools and my own experience, I\u2019ll help you see that while you can\u2019t control others\u2019 thoughts or feelings, you can create empowering relationships by redefining connection on your own terms. What You\u2019ll Learn in This Episode: Why relationships often feel unstable after a faith transition How the Self-Coaching Model can help you take ownership of your thoughts and expectations T he concept of \u201Cmanuals\u201D and how they create hidden pressure in relationships How to set healthy boundaries without cutting yourself off from love Why unconditional love starts with your relationship to yourself Listen if you\u2019re wondering: Why does it feel like my relationships are falling apart after leaving my religion? How do I navigate family tension when I no longer believe? Is it possible to feel connected without pretending to be someone I\u2019m not?

In this episode of Mormon to Muse, we\u2019ll explore the crucial difference between the two\u2014and why understanding it matters for your healing and growth. What You\u2019ll Learn in This Episode: The difference between leaving religion and deconstructing faith Why leaving can still leave you tied to old beliefs and patterns How deconstruction helps you rebuild trust in yourself and your inner authority The emotional impact of each path and what it means for your relationships Practical ways to notice if you\u2019re still carrying chains from your old belief system Why This Matters: Many ex-Mormons (and people from other high-demand religions) struggle because they\u2019ve walked away physically but are still living under the same mental and emotional framework. Deconstructing allows you to not only leave but also take apart the beliefs that no longer serve you\u2014and begin building something new.

In this episode of Mormon to Muse, I explore why change feels so uncomfortable, how our brains resist it, and how we can use both mindset tools and the creative process to embrace new seasons of life. You\u2019ll learn: The biological and cultural reasons we resist change\u2014even when we want it. How predictability and control keep us stuck. Mindset shifts that can help you cope with transitions and see them as opportunities. The surprising ways art can teach us to release perfectionism and welcome growth. Whether you\u2019re navigating faith transitions, relationships, career shifts, or simply the unpredictability of everyday life, this episode will give you fresh insight and practical tools for moving forward with more confidence.

      "description": "UPDATE- In this episode I talk about the idea of creating beauty from pain. I meant to mention that this idea comes from Susan Cain\u0027s book Bittersweet: How Sorrow and Longing Makes Us Whole. If you want to build a life that feels aligned, meaningful, and free\u2014you have to be willing to feel everything. In this follow-up to Episode 11 (Why You Are Emotionally Stunted), we dive into the how. How do you actually feel your feelings instead of resisting, reacting, avoiding, or spiritualizing them? What do you do with pain that won\u2019t go away? And why is being emotionally willing the ultimate superpower in creating the life you truly want? Rooted in the Self-Coaching Model (CTFAR), this episode teaches you how to allow emotion without being consumed by it\u2014and how to stop letting your feelings quietly run the show from the background. In This Episode, You\u2019ll Learn: Why feeling your feelings is the key to long-term change How emotional resistance drains your energy and keeps you stuck What it really means to \u0022allow\u0022 an emotion (and what it doesn\u0027t) How spiritualizing pain can block healing What to do with emotions that seem to never go away Why discomfort is the price of living authentically\u2014and why it\u2019s worth it Get the Sunday Muse email Subscribe on YouTube: @mormontomuse1 Follow Kristin on Instagram: @mormontomuse #FeelYourFeelings #PostMormonHealing #SelfCoachingModel #TherapeuticArt #EmotionalWillingness #FaithTransition #CreativeHealing #MormonToMuse #ReligiousDeconstruction #EmotionalResilience While this isn\u2019t art therapy, and I\u2019m not a licensed therapist, these creative exercises have been powerful tools for healing in my own life and in the lives of women I work with",

You\u2019ll learn why feelings matter, how they drive everything we do (or don\u2019t do), and what goes wrong when we resist, react to, avoid, or spiritualize our emotions.\n\nThis is part one of a two-part series that will help you build emotional literacy, reclaim emotional agency, and get back in the driver\u2019s seat of your own life.\n\nWhat We Cover: Why feelings\u2014not circumstances\u2014create your experience\n\nHow American culture and Mormonism both discourage emotional honesty\n\nWhat happens when you resist, react to, or avoid your feelings\n\nThe spiritualization of emotion in high-demand religion Why reclaiming your full emotional range is essential to healing\n\nCLICK HERE to sign up for Sunday Muse.

In this episode, you\u0027ll learn: The most common barriers to self-discovery for post-Mormon women (including fear, people-pleasing, and black-and-white thinking) Why high-control systems discourage self-exploration How to recognize when you\u2019re avoiding your own desires, feelings, or needs Fear of disappointing others often keeps us small.

In this episode of Mormon to Muse, we\u2019re talking about waking up to those dynamics using Stephen Hassan\u2019s BITE Model as our guide. The BITE Model is a framework for identifying authoritarian control in cults and high-control groups. It breaks manipulation into four clear categories: Behavior Control Information Control Thought Control Emotional Control By examining each piece, you can start to recognize the systems you were part of\u2014not as personal failure, but as designed to keep you compliant. This conversation is for you if: You\u2019re deconstructing Mormonism or any rigid belief system You want to understand why leaving feels so hard You\u2019re working to rebuild self-trust and personal authority You suspect the group you left might have used coercive or manipulative tactics In this episode, we cover: What the BITE Model is and why it\u2019s so helpful for ex-Mormons How Mormonism exerts control over behavior (dress codes, obedience culture, time demands) How information is tightly managed (approved sources, anti-Mormon labeling, correlated curriculum) How thought control shows up (thought-stopping, black-and-white thinking, prophetic authority) How emotional control keeps people in line (fear, guilt, shame, love-bombing) Signs you\u2019re waking up to these forms of control in your own life Why naming these patterns is a key step in reclaiming your freedom Get the Sunday Muse Email: Want weekly art prompts and reflections to help you heal after high-demand religion?

      "description": "When you leave a high-demand religion like Mormonism, one of the biggest challenges isn\u2019t just rethinking your beliefs\u2014it\u2019s learning how to think again without relying on external authority. In this episode of Mormon to Muse, I share a four-part framework that\u2019s helped me rebuild critical thinking as a spiritual and creative practice: Logos (logic), Ethos (credibility), Pathos (emotion), and Duos (paradox). We\u2019ll explore how each of these shows up in everyday decisions\u2014and in your art. Because the truth is, how you approach a blank canvas often mirrors how you approach your own inner life. In this episode, you\u2019ll learn: What each of the four modes means and how they work together How high-demand religion often distorts or suppresses these ways of thinking Why Duos\u2014the ability to hold two truths at once\u2014is especially vital for post-Mormons How you can apply each part of this framework not just to life, but to your creative process We\u2019ll also discuss how: Logos shows up as structure, planning, and composition in your artwork Ethos guides your authentic voice and creative integrity Pathos emerges through color, emotion, and intuitive expression Duos invites you to hold tension in your art without needing to resolve it Want to go deeper?

      "description": "In this very first episode, I\u2019m sharing a piece of my own story \u2014 how I navigated a painful faith transition and how art became a lifeline through the uncertainty, grief, and rebuilding that followed. Leaving the belief system I was raised in wasn\u2019t just about walking away; it was about losing a whole framework for identity, community, and meaning. It was disorienting, heartbreaking... and ultimately, freeing. Through creativity \u2014 starting with simple watercolor paintings \u2014 I found a way to process emotions that words couldn\u2019t touch. Art helped me reclaim my voice, rebuild my sense of self, and reconnect with a deeper, wiser part of me that religion had silenced. In this episode, you\u0027ll hear: A little about my upbringing and faith journey The unexpected role creativity played in my healing Why making art (even imperfectly) is such a powerful tool for navigating transition. What you can expect from this podcast going forward Whether you\u0027re deep in your own deconstruction or just starting to ask questions, I hope this story reminds you that healing isn\u2019t linear \u2014 but it is possible.
