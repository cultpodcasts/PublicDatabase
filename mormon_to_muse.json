      "description": "What if the frustration, self-doubt, and awkwardness you feel when learning something new isn\u2019t a sign you\u2019re failing\u2014but proof that you\u2019re exactly where you\u2019re supposed to be?\n\nIn this episode of Mormon to Muse, we explore The Four Stages of Learning and how this framework can help you understand your creative process, your healing journey, and your identity rebuilding after leaving a high-demand system like Mormonism. Whether you\u2019re learning how to paint, how to feel your emotions, how to trust yourself, or how to live without external authority telling you what\u2019s \u201Cright,\u201D these stages explain why growth often feels uncomfortable\u2014and why that discomfort is necessary.\n\nIn This Episode, We Explore: What the Four Stages of Learning are and how they show up in everyday life\n\nWhy unconscious incompetence can feel deceptively safe Why the second stage\u2014conscious incompetence\u2014is the hardest and most tempting place to quit How perfectionism and comparison keep us stuck\n\nWhy mastery is not a permanent destination but a moving relationship with growth How learning art mirrors emotional healing and identity reconstruction\n\nThe Four Stages of Learning: Uninformed Optimism \u2013 You don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know\n\nInformed Pessimism \u2013 You see the gap, and it feels uncomfortable\n\nInformed Optimism \u00A0\u2013 You can do it, but it takes effort and attention\n\nMastery/Integration \u2013 The skill becomes integrated and embodied\n\nThis episode reframes frustration as information, not evidence that you\u2019re \u201Cbehind\u201D or \u201Cnot cut out for this.\u201D\n\nWhy This Matters After Leaving Mormonism: Many women leave the church believing that if something is meant for them, it should feel easy or immediately clear. But learning\u2014especially emotional and creative learning\u2014doesn\u2019t work that way. Understanding these stages helps you: Stop interpreting discomfort as disqualification Build self-trust instead of outsourcing authority Stay with yourself during the messy middle of growth.",

      "description": "Get the Anxiety Soothing art prompts HERE\n\nDistraction isn\u2019t a personal failure. It\u2019s a symptom.\n\nIn this episode of Mormon to Muse, we explore distraction not as a productivity problem\u2014but as an attention and devotion problem. Especially for women who were raised in high-demand systems, distraction often develops as a survival strategy: a way to avoid discomfort, override intuition, and stay externally focused.\n\nWe talk about how modern digital life mimics the same patterns many of us learned in religion\u2014limited choices, constant input, and subtle pressure to look outward instead of inward. And we gently reframe attention as something sacred, powerful, and reclaimable.\n\nThis episode isn\u2019t about deleting apps or becoming more disciplined. It\u2019s about noticing where your attention goes, what it protects you from feeling, and how to return to yourself without shame.\n\n\u00A0\n\nIn This Episode, We Explore Why distraction is often a nervous-system response, not a lack of willpower\n\nHow high-demand religions train us to outsource attention and authority\n\nThe hidden cost of constant stimulation and emotional avoidance\n\nWhy \u201Cpaying attention\u201D is a form of devotion How creative expression helps restore presence and inner trust\n\nWhat it means to gently return to yourself again and again Key Ideas\n\nAttention is not neutral\u2014it shapes your inner life\n\nDistraction often protects us from emotions we were never taught how to feel You don\u2019t need more discipline; you need more permission\n\nAwareness, not shame, is the doorway back to yourself\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590291125005212?utm_source=chatgpt.com\n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8622754/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#sec6-ijerph-18-12257\n\nUpstream by Mary Oliver (Penguin Press, 2016)",

      "description": "Leaving a high-demand system like Mormonism often leaves us with an unexpected residue \u2014 a deep, body-level sense of scarcity. Scarcity of time. Scarcity of worth. Scarcity of permission. Scarcity of possibility.\n\nIn today\u2019s episode, we explore what it means to practice abundance as an act of rebellion. We look at how Claude Monet \u2014 yes, the Monet of water lilies and gardens \u2014 refused to let grief, loss, or tradition confine him. Instead, he expanded. He painted obsessively, repetitively, and on a scale that defied every expectation of what a \u201Cproper\u201D painting should be. His art became a declaration of abundance: \u201CI will not stay small. I will not be limited. I will create more.\u201D After leaving the church, many of us feel \u201Ctoo late,\u201D \u201Ctoo behind,\u201D or \u201Ctoo broken\u201D to begin again. But abundance isn\u2019t about money or perfection \u2014 it\u2019s about choosing expansion over contraction. It\u2019s about reclaiming the parts of you that were muted, doubted, or dismissed. It\u2019s about refusing to let your pain be the final author of your life.\n\nIn this episode, you\u2019ll learn: Why scarcity wiring runs so deep after a high-control environment\n\nHow to identify when \u201CI\u2019m not enough\u201D is actually conditioning talking\n\nWhat Monet can teach us about devotion, repetition, and creative expansion\n\nHow abundance becomes an internal stance, not an external circumstance\n\nWhy embracing beauty, pleasure, and creativity is rebellious for women raised in patriarchy\n\nThe small, daily shifts that open you to receiving more \u2014 more joy, more possibility, more self-trust\n\nWe also talk about the surprising truth: abundance isn\u2019t something you wait to feel. It\u2019s something you practice your way into. Just like Monet did.\n\nIf anxiety or old conditioning still pulls you into fear or scarcity, download my free Anxiety-Reducing Art Exercises \u2014 three simple creative practices to help your body soften and your mind reconnect with possibility.

      "description": "Hi friends,\n\nGet my\u00A0Anxiety Soothing Art\u00A0if you need a small ritual to bring peace.\u00A0\n\nThis week on the podcast, we\u2019re talking about rituals\u2014the ones we inherited, the ones we outgrew, and the ones we\u2019re allowed to create now.\n\nIf you grew up in Mormonism, your life was full of ritual. Prayer, family home evening, blessings, temple ceremonies, holidays with strict meaning attached. There was a rhythm to everything, even if that rhythm came with pressure, perfectionism, and emotional suppression.\n\nLeaving the church often means losing that rhythm. Not just the beliefs\u2014but the structure that held your days and seasons. And suddenly there\u2019s this space. This quiet. This sense of floating. This question: What do I anchor myself to now? Here\u2019s the truth I want you to hear: Ritual never belonged to the Church. Ritual belongs to you. Ritual is older than religion. It\u2019s human. It\u2019s creative. It\u2019s nervous-system regulation wrapped in meaning-making. It\u2019s what our ancestors used to mark time, soothe themselves, and feel connected to their lives.\n\nYou get to reclaim that now. You get to decide what opens your mornings. What closes your evenings. What your holidays look like. What your family gathers around. What moments you choose to call sacred\u2014in the truest, most honest sense of the word. You don\u2019t need permission. You don\u2019t need a calling. You don\u2019t need a handbook.\n\nYour rituals can be tiny: Lighting a candle. Taking one deep breath before dinner. Writing down three things you accomplished that day. A weekly walk. A monthly art night. A December tradition that feels like home to you. Ritual is simply attention repeated. It\u2019s presence practiced. It\u2019s choosing what matters to you now\u2014and letting that guide your rhythm. This is part of becoming. This is part of healing your nervous system after years of external structure. This is part of learning to trust yourself again. This is you building a life that fits.\n\nGet my\u00A0Anxiety Soothing Art\u00A0if you need a small ritual to bring peace.",

      "description": "What happens when the rules you grew up with continue running your life long after you\u2019ve left the system that taught them? In today\u2019s episode, we\u2019re talking about internalized constraint\u2014the invisible expectations, fears, obligations, and \u201Cshoulds\u201D that live inside your nervous system and shape your choices without you even realizing it.\n\nWhether you grew up in Mormonism or any high-demand environment, you learned to be \u201Cgood\u201D in ways that required self-abandonment: don\u2019t question, don\u2019t feel too much, don\u2019t want too much, don\u2019t upset anyone, don\u2019t take up too much space. Over time, those external rules become internal scripts. This episode helps you identify those scripts, understand how they form, and most importantly, learn how to dismantle them so you can make decisions from a place of inner authority rather than fear, guilt, or conditioning.\n\nIn this episode, you\u2019ll learn: What \u201Cinternalized constraint\u201D actually means and why it\u2019s not your fault How your upbringing trained your nervous system to override your intuition\n\nThe difference between internalized constraint and an internal locus of control\n\nWhy you still feel guilty or anxious even after leaving the church\n\nHow to recognize the internal cage vs. your authentic inner voice\n\nSmall, practical shifts that help you reclaim your agency\n\nHow creative expression helps loosen old conditioning and create internal spaciousness\n\nWhy this matters: You can leave the system but still have the system living inside you. Your healing isn\u2019t about proving anything to anyone\u2014it\u2019s about learning to trust yourself again. And the good news? The moment you start paying attention to your feelings, your body, and your creativity, that internal cage begins to open.\n\n\u00A0\u27A1\uFE0F Download my free \u201CAnxiety-Soothing Art Exercises\u201D HERE\n\nThey\u2019re gentle, beginner-friendly, and designed specifically for nervous system regulation.",

      "description": "In this episode, we explore one of the most important\u2014and misunderstood\u2014stories in the feminine archive: Bluebeard.\n\nThis tale isn\u2019t about morbid curiosity or a woman \u201Cdisobeying.\u201D It\u2019s about awakening. About reclaiming the instinct to know what you know. About refusing to live in a house of secrets and silence. Bluebeard is the archetype of any system\u2014religious, cultural, or relational\u2014that says: \u201CDon\u2019t look. Don\u2019t question. Don\u2019t open that door.\u201D But when a woman opens the hidden room, she isn\u2019t betraying anyone. She\u2019s returning to herself.\n\nWe talk about: Why the \u201Cforbidden room\u201D is always the room of truth\n\nHow high-demand systems cultivate fear of inner knowing\n\nWhy awakening is never passive\u2014it requires seeing what\u2019s actually there\n\nWhat this story shows us about feminine intelligence, boundaries, and freedom\n\nThis is a must-listen if you were taught that obedience is safety, that questioning is dangerous, or that following your intuition makes you ungrateful or rebellious.\n\nBluebeard is the patron saint of every woman who has ever whispered, \u201CSomething feels wrong,\u201D and then opened the door anyway.\n\nIf leaving a high-demand system has left your nervous system on constant alert\u2014or if waking up to your own truth feels both empowering and terrifying\u2014these simple art exercises will help.

      "description": "Get the free\u00A0Prompts to calm anxiety\n\nWhen you\u0027ve spent years\u2014or decades\u2014being told what is right, what is true, and what is best for you, trusting yourself again can feel disorienting. Many women raised in high-demand religious systems were taught that external authority is more trustworthy than their own internal wisdom. So when they leave, they\u2019re left asking: What do I actually believe? What do I want? And how do I know if my intuition is something I can trust?\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the process of rebuilding self-trust after religious conditioning. We look at why intuition can feel confusing, how emotional suppression plays into it, and why it\u2019s common to fear making the \u201Cwrong\u201D choice once there\u2019s no longer a clear rulebook to follow.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn how to relate to your intuition in a grounded, steady way\u2014without needing it to be perfect or magical. Inside this episode: How high-demand systems train you to defer to authority Why intuition often goes offline when your nervous system doesn\u2019t feel safe\n\nThe fear of getting it wrong, disappointing others, or making a choice you can\u2019t undo Why intuition is quiet and subtle\u2014not dramatic or urgent How to begin repairing the relationship with your inner voice through small, consistent acts of self-honoring\n\nThe difference between intuition and anxiety (and how to tell them apart) What it means to let yourself experiment without self-punishment Trusting your intuition isn\u2019t about always knowing the answer. It\u2019s about building a relationship with yourself that can tolerate uncertainty and still move forward. This is how personal authority is reclaimed\u2014gently, slowly, one self-honoring decision at a time.\n\nMentioned in this episode: Download the free therapeutic art exercises to help soothe anxiety and reconnect with your inner wisdom: https://www.mormontomuse.com/anxiety-art\n\nIf this episode resonated with you: Leave a review, share it with someone who might benefit, and subscribe so you don\u2019t miss future episodes.",

Have you ever noticed how scrolling, watching, or even listening to \u201Cinspiring\u201D content can leave you feeling tired \u2014 not fulfilled? In this episode, Kristin Martineau explores the energetic difference between creating and consuming \u2014 and why creating, even in small ways, restores our sense of presence, purpose, and self-connection. We talk about why humans are wired to create, why women in particular feel called to express and make meaning, and how creativity becomes a radical act of healing after living in systems that discouraged individuality or expression. If you\u2019ve been feeling overstimulated, disconnected, or creatively blocked, this episode will help you slow down, tune in, and rediscover the power of making something that\u2019s yours. In This Episode, You\u2019ll Learn: Why consuming (even \u201Cgood\u201D content) can leave you drained instead of inspired The biological and emotional benefits of creative expression Why women are especially driven to create \u2014 and how it helps us reclaim energy, identity, and voice How to shift from passive consumption to active creation in small, simple ways How art, journaling, and presence can reconnect you with your inner muse.

      "description": "In this episode of Mormon to Muse, we\u2019re talking about desire \u2014 that quiet pulse beneath duty, expectation, and fear. If you grew up in a system that taught you to distrust your longings or call them selfish, you\u2019re not alone. Many of us learned to silence the very parts of ourselves that lead us toward joy, creativity, and growth. But what if desire isn\u2019t dangerous? What if it\u2019s a sacred form of guidance \u2014 your inner compass pointing you back to what makes you feel alive? Join me as we explore: Why high-demand systems condition women to fear their desires How suppressing longing leads to disconnection, resentment, and self-doubt The difference between impulsive wanting and soulful desire How creativity and art-making help you reconnect with what you truly want Simple ways to start listening to your longings again \u2014 without shame or guilt You\u2019ll leave this episode with a deeper understanding of how desire can be a spiritual practice \u2014 one that honors your body, your emotions, and your becoming.

Come say hello! If you want to come to my class be sure to purchase the art kit ($10) ahead of time to guarantee your spot! Confidence is not something you\u2019re born with or without\u2014it\u2019s something you create. In this episode, we explore what true confidence is, what blocks it, and how to start building it from the inside out. Growing up in a high-demand system like Mormonism often means confidence gets tangled up with perfectionism, obedience, and external approval. Many of us were taught to distrust our own inner knowing, leaving us uncertain of our worth or abilities. But confidence isn\u2019t about being flawless or always right\u2014it\u2019s about trusting yourself to figure things out along the way. In this conversation, you\u2019ll learn: The difference between real confidence and false confidence. How cultural and religious messages can undermine self-trust. Why self-doubt and confidence can exist side by side\u2014and how to choose which one to nurture. The role of feelings in creating confidence (and why it\u2019s a practice, not a personality trait).

In this episode of Mormon to Muse, I break down how this kind of rhetoric works, why it\u2019s so effective, and the impact it has on individuals raised inside high-demand systems.\n\nI share examples from Mormon leaders, extremist religious figures, and even both major U.S. political parties to show just how universal this tactic is.

Whether it\u2019s family who remain devout, a spouse who doesn\u2019t understand your journey, or friendships that once revolved around shared beliefs, relationships can feel like the hardest part of faith transition.

Drawing on life coaching tools and my own experience, I\u2019ll help you see that while you can\u2019t control others\u2019 thoughts or feelings, you can create empowering relationships by redefining connection on your own terms.

In this episode of Mormon to Muse, we\u2019ll explore the crucial difference between the two\u2014and why understanding it matters for your healing and growth. What You\u2019ll Learn in This Episode: The difference between leaving religion and deconstructing faith Why leaving can still leave you tied to old beliefs and patterns How deconstruction helps you rebuild trust in yourself and your inner authority The emotional impact of each path and what it means for your relationships Practical ways to notice if you\u2019re still carrying chains from your old belief system Why This Matters: Many ex-Mormons (and people from other high-demand religions) struggle because they\u2019ve walked away physically but are still living under the same mental and emotional framework. Deconstructing allows you to not only leave but also take apart the beliefs that no longer serve you\u2014and begin building something new.

      "description": "UPDATE- In this episode I talk about the idea of creating beauty from pain. I meant to mention that this idea comes from Susan Cain\u0027s book Bittersweet: How Sorrow and Longing Makes Us Whole. If you want to build a life that feels aligned, meaningful, and free\u2014you have to be willing to feel everything. In this follow-up to Episode 11 (Why You Are Emotionally Stunted), we dive into the how. How do you actually feel your feelings instead of resisting, reacting, avoiding, or spiritualizing them? What do you do with pain that won\u2019t go away? And why is being emotionally willing the ultimate superpower in creating the life you truly want? Rooted in the Self-Coaching Model (CTFAR), this episode teaches you how to allow emotion without being consumed by it\u2014and how to stop letting your feelings quietly run the show from the background. In This Episode, You\u2019ll Learn: Why feeling your feelings is the key to long-term change How emotional resistance drains your energy and keeps you stuck What it really means to \u0022allow\u0022 an emotion (and what it doesn\u0027t) How spiritualizing pain can block healing What to do with emotions that seem to never go away Why discomfort is the price of living authentically\u2014and why it\u2019s worth it Get the Sunday Muse email Subscribe on YouTube: @mormontomuse1 Follow Kristin on Instagram: @mormontomuse #FeelYourFeelings #PostMormonHealing #SelfCoachingModel #TherapeuticArt #EmotionalWillingness #FaithTransition #CreativeHealing #MormonToMuse #ReligiousDeconstruction #EmotionalResilience While this isn\u2019t art therapy, and I\u2019m not a licensed therapist, these creative exercises have been powerful tools for healing in my own life and in the lives of women I work with",

You\u2019ll learn why feelings matter, how they drive everything we do (or don\u2019t do), and what goes wrong when we resist, react to, avoid, or spiritualize our emotions.\n\nThis is part one of a two-part series that will help you build emotional literacy, reclaim emotional agency, and get back in the driver\u2019s seat of your own life.\n\nWhat We Cover: Why feelings\u2014not circumstances\u2014create your experience\n\nHow American culture and Mormonism both discourage emotional honesty\n\nWhat happens when you resist, react to, or avoid your feelings\n\nThe spiritualization of emotion in high-demand religion Why reclaiming your full emotional range is essential to healing\n\nCLICK HERE to sign up for Sunday Muse.

      "description": "Welcome to Mormon to Muse, the podcast for post-Mormon women ready to heal, reconnect with themselves, and create a life that feels truly their own. In Episode 7, we\u2019re exploring barriers to self-discovery\u2014the hidden obstacles that can keep you stuck, disconnected, and unsure of who you really are. Leaving Mormonism (or any high-demand religion) can feel like stepping into the unknown.

Today we\u2019ll look at why that happens\u2014and what you can do about it. In this episode, you\u0027ll learn: The most common barriers to self-discovery for post-Mormon women (including fear, people-pleasing, and black-and-white thinking) Why high-control systems discourage self-exploration How to recognize when you\u2019re avoiding your own desires, feelings, or needs Fear of disappointing others often keeps us small.

      "description": "Leaving Mormonism\u2014or any high-demand religion\u2014often means realizing that what felt \u201Cnormal\u201D was actually coercive control. In this episode of Mormon to Muse, we\u2019re talking about waking up to those dynamics using Stephen Hassan\u2019s BITE Model as our guide. The BITE Model is a framework for identifying authoritarian control in cults and high-control groups. It breaks manipulation into four clear categories: Behavior Control Information Control Thought Control Emotional Control By examining each piece, you can start to recognize the systems you were part of\u2014not as personal failure, but as designed to keep you compliant. This conversation is for you if: You\u2019re deconstructing Mormonism or any rigid belief system You want to understand why leaving feels so hard You\u2019re working to rebuild self-trust and personal authority You suspect the group you left might have used coercive or manipulative tactics In this episode, we cover: What the BITE Model is and why it\u2019s so helpful for ex-Mormons How Mormonism exerts control over behavior (dress codes, obedience culture, time demands) How information is tightly managed (approved sources, anti-Mormon labeling, correlated curriculum) How thought control shows up (thought-stopping, black-and-white thinking, prophetic authority) How emotional control keeps people in line (fear, guilt, shame, love-bombing) Signs you\u2019re waking up to these forms of control in your own life Why naming these patterns is a key step in reclaiming your freedom Get the Sunday Muse Email: Want weekly art prompts and reflections to help you heal after high-demand religion?

      "description": "When you leave a high-demand religion like Mormonism, one of the biggest challenges isn\u2019t just rethinking your beliefs\u2014it\u2019s learning how to think again without relying on external authority. In this episode of Mormon to Muse, I share a four-part framework that\u2019s helped me rebuild critical thinking as a spiritual and creative practice: Logos (logic), Ethos (credibility), Pathos (emotion), and Duos (paradox). We\u2019ll explore how each of these shows up in everyday decisions\u2014and in your art. Because the truth is, how you approach a blank canvas often mirrors how you approach your own inner life. In this episode, you\u2019ll learn: What each of the four modes means and how they work together How high-demand religion often distorts or suppresses these ways of thinking Why Duos\u2014the ability to hold two truths at once\u2014is especially vital for post-Mormons How you can apply each part of this framework not just to life, but to your creative process We\u2019ll also discuss how: Logos shows up as structure, planning, and composition in your artwork Ethos guides your authentic voice and creative integrity Pathos emerges through color, emotion, and intuitive expression Duos invites you to hold tension in your art without needing to resolve it Want to go deeper?

      "description": "In this very first episode, I\u2019m sharing a piece of my own story \u2014 how I navigated a painful faith transition and how art became a lifeline through the uncertainty, grief, and rebuilding that followed. Leaving the belief system I was raised in wasn\u2019t just about walking away; it was about losing a whole framework for identity, community, and meaning. It was disorienting, heartbreaking... and ultimately, freeing. Through creativity \u2014 starting with simple watercolor paintings \u2014 I found a way to process emotions that words couldn\u2019t touch. Art helped me reclaim my voice, rebuild my sense of self, and reconnect with a deeper, wiser part of me that religion had silenced. In this episode, you\u0027ll hear: A little about my upbringing and faith journey The unexpected role creativity played in my healing Why making art (even imperfectly) is such a powerful tool for navigating transition. What you can expect from this podcast going forward Whether you\u0027re deep in your own deconstruction or just starting to ask questions, I hope this story reminds you that healing isn\u2019t linear \u2014 but it is possible. Thanks for being here. I\u2019m so glad we\u2019re doing this together. Sign up for Monday Muse to get a free creative healing exercise sent to your inbox every week. You can find me on instagram at Mormon to Muse and on YouTube While this isn\u2019t art therapy, and I\u2019m not a licensed therapist, these creative exercises have been powerful tools for healing in my own life and in the lives of women I work with",
