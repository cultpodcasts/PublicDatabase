      "description": "Welcome to Mormon to Muse, the podcast for post-Mormon women ready to heal, reconnect with themselves, and create a life that feels truly their own. In Episode 7, we\u2019re exploring barriers to self-discovery\u2014the hidden obstacles that can keep you stuck, disconnected, and unsure of who you really are. Leaving Mormonism (or any high-demand religion) can feel like stepping into the unknown. Even after you reject old beliefs, you might find yourself repeating old patterns or struggling to know what you really want. Today we\u2019ll look at why that happens\u2014and what you can do about it. In this episode, you\u0027ll learn: The most common barriers to self-discovery for post-Mormon women (including fear, people-pleasing, and black-and-white thinking) Why high-control systems discourage self-exploration How to recognize when you\u2019re avoiding your own desires, feelings, or needs Fear of disappointing others often keeps us small.

      "description": "Leaving Mormonism\u2014or any high-demand religion\u2014often means realizing that what felt \u201Cnormal\u201D was actually coercive control. In this episode of Mormon to Muse, we\u2019re talking about waking up to those dynamics using Stephen Hassan\u2019s BITE Model as our guide. The BITE Model is a framework for identifying authoritarian control in cults and high-control groups. It breaks manipulation into four clear categories: Behavior Control Information Control Thought Control Emotional Control By examining each piece, you can start to recognize the systems you were part of\u2014not as personal failure, but as designed to keep you compliant. This conversation is for you if: You\u2019re deconstructing Mormonism or any rigid belief system You want to understand why leaving feels so hard You\u2019re working to rebuild self-trust and personal authority You suspect the group you left might have used coercive or manipulative tactics In this episode, we cover: What the BITE Model is and why it\u2019s so helpful for ex-Mormons How Mormonism exerts control over behavior (dress codes, obedience culture, time demands) How information is tightly managed (approved sources, anti-Mormon labeling, correlated curriculum) How thought control shows up (thought-stopping, black-and-white thinking, prophetic authority) How emotional control keeps people in line (fear, guilt, shame, love-bombing) Signs you\u2019re waking up to these forms of control in your own life Why naming these patterns is a key step in reclaiming your freedom Get the Sunday Muse Email: Want weekly art prompts and reflections to help you heal after high-demand religion?

      "description": "When you leave a high-demand religion like Mormonism, one of the biggest challenges isn\u2019t just rethinking your beliefs\u2014it\u2019s learning how to think again without relying on external authority. In this episode of Mormon to Muse, I share a four-part framework that\u2019s helped me rebuild critical thinking as a spiritual and creative practice: Logos (logic), Ethos (credibility), Pathos (emotion), and Duos (paradox). We\u2019ll explore how each of these shows up in everyday decisions\u2014and in your art. Because the truth is, how you approach a blank canvas often mirrors how you approach your own inner life. In this episode, you\u2019ll learn: What each of the four modes means and how they work together How high-demand religion often distorts or suppresses these ways of thinking Why Duos\u2014the ability to hold two truths at once\u2014is especially vital for post-Mormons How you can apply each part of this framework not just to life, but to your creative process We\u2019ll also discuss how: Logos shows up as structure, planning, and composition in your artwork Ethos guides your authentic voice and creative integrity Pathos emerges through color, emotion, and intuitive expression Duos invites you to hold tension in your art without needing to resolve it Want to go deeper?

      "description": "In this very first episode, I\u2019m sharing a piece of my own story \u2014 how I navigated a painful faith transition and how art became a lifeline through the uncertainty, grief, and rebuilding that followed. Leaving the belief system I was raised in wasn\u2019t just about walking away; it was about losing a whole framework for identity, community, and meaning. It was disorienting, heartbreaking... and ultimately, freeing. Through creativity \u2014 starting with simple watercolor paintings \u2014 I found a way to process emotions that words couldn\u2019t touch. Art helped me reclaim my voice, rebuild my sense of self, and reconnect with a deeper, wiser part of me that religion had silenced. In this episode, you\u0027ll hear: A little about my upbringing and faith journey The unexpected role creativity played in my healing Why making art (even imperfectly) is such a powerful tool for navigating transition. What you can expect from this podcast going forward Whether you\u0027re deep in your own deconstruction or just starting to ask questions, I hope this story reminds you that healing isn\u2019t linear \u2014 but it is possible. Thanks for being here. I\u2019m so glad we\u2019re doing this together. Sign up for Monday Muse to get a free creative healing exercise sent to your inbox every week.
