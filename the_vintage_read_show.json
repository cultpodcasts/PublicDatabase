      "title": "Why Did The Met Police Fail To Act For Over 15 Years?",
      "description": "In this snippet from our complete interview; historian and author Andrew Lownie lays out the case for a full, independent investigation into why the Metropolitan Police repeatedly refused to pursue a criminal inquiry into Prince Andrew\u2019s links to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nWe examine the Met\u2019s shifting explanations, the gaps in their public statements, and the unanswered questions that continue to undermine confidence in the UK\u2019s justice system. Why did the police rely on a \u201Creview\u201D rather than a formal investigation? What evidence was dismissed without scrutiny? And what role, if any, did institutional pressures or deference to the monarchy play in shaping the outcome?\n\nThis conversation goes beyond the headlines. It asks what accountability looks like in a system where power, privilege, and policing intersect \u2014 and why transparency is essential if the public is ever to trust the process.\n\nIf you value clear, evidence\u2011based analysis on royal scandals, institutional failures, and the machinery of reputation, this is an interview you won\u2019t want to miss.\n\n\nHi, and welcome to The Vintage Read Show hosted by Shauna Kay!\nIf you would like to watch more of my episodes, you can find direct links below:\n\nLike, share and subscribe for FREE to The Vintage Read Show!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkt6HfmZo7bWZMFSMA0tigg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nI appreciate all your support, thank you.\nShauna Kay \n\nLINKS:\nLatest Videos: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHtjd5sKD71g3UwYa18DHmVShdvpQYO1z\n\nThe Vintage Read Show CLIPS:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHtjd5sKD71iMTUBWBeb9mFcnZOgfol5Y\n\nShauna Kay \u0026 Tom Sykes:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/378GlKEHxtQ?si=P8Q3ACc_P5TPhnu_\n\nAndrew Lownie \u0026 Shauna Kay:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHtjd5sKD71gHXsekcio4ckkQsvUalcnE\n\nShauna Kay and TAZ:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHtjd5sKD71ivCVc4KJAcb9WpEcwXL-5f\n\nBook Reviews \u0026 Interviews:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHtjd5sKD71ibOxzk8mT9093kN5xY1tNv",
