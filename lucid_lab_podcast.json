      "title": "Mormon Manson: The Bloody Legacy of Ervil LeBaron (Part 2 of 2)",
      "description": "Outside of Juarez, Mexico in the 1970s, Ervil LeBaron led a fundamentalist sect of the Mormon religion known as the Lambs of God. Ervil would gather many followers and lead them down a treacherous path that involved killing their own family members in the name of God. By the time it was all done, there would be over 30 people killed but Ervil would never pull a trigger or kill one person by his own hand. This is what earned him the name of The Mormon Manson. In the second part of our story, we go into the LeBaron family as they flee Utah to escape the religious persecution after polygamy was outlawed. Once in Mexico, the LeBarons would claim to be the righful heir to Joseph Smith himself and the title of the One Mighty \u0026 Strong would pass to various brothers, all vying to be the one in control of the colony. This is where things go very, very wrong resulting in many unnecessary deaths. __________ Follow Lucid Lab Podcast on your favorite platform and be sure to subscribe and leave a review where available!

In this first part of our story, we will go back to understand some core teachings that were established by the early 1800s prophets of the Mormon church. One of those being the dangerous philosophy of Blood Atonement introduced by Brigham Young that would result in these murders 100\u0026#43; years later. __________ Follow Lucid Lab Podcast on your favorite platform and be sure to subscribe and leave a review where available!

      "description": "It\u2019s our first cult story! Welcome to The Family! The Family, or The Great White Brotherhood, is a woman-led doomsday cult founded in the 1960s in beautiful Australia. It is the twisted story of Anne Hamilton-Bryne, who gained too much power way too fast and destroyed all the lives of those who followed her. Especially her precious children. She was the Messiah, and her children were to educate what was left of humanity after the apocalypse. She was selfish, vain, and evil. And her Aunties were not the type of Aunties you would want to raise your children. Listen in to hear all the sinister details. There is a reason some consider her to be one of the cruelest people to come from Australia. --- Please rate and subscribe on iTunes and anywhere else you listen to podcasts!!
