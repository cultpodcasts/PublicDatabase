      "description": "DN Ep 239 Escaping Religion with Amber\n\u00A0\nI was joined by Amber, an ex-Jehovah\u0027s Witness, to tell her tale of awakening, discovery, and truth. As a fifth-generation JW, with 10 family members as elders in the organization, she was primed and ready to believe they were the only true \u0022religion.\u0022 The lockdown opened her eyes, and the veil was lifted. From sexual abuse scandals, dark history, expectations of perfection and blind obedience, and shunning of \u0022outsiders\u0022, the journey to discovery has been vast.\nFollow Amber on IG @cult.life.escaped\nTikTok and YouTube Cult life escaped\n\u00A0\n#cult #escapingacult #religion #shunning #outisders #JehovahsWitness #obedience #perfection #submission",
