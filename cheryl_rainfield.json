The number of times that they took me to members of the congregation of the church, or their friends or colleagues to offer me up for them to sexually assault me for favours or power or money was frequent and horrific. Most of the time they called out specific parts of me with the dissociative identity to service the people but if they didn\u0027t we knew that we had to switch into it because that was survival. I think the only reason I was birthed was to offer me up to the cult and give my parents a promotion.

Or we can put those folks inside giving us the programming messages on the moon imside, or in a soundproof unbreakable bubble. \n\nBut these things are just stopgap measures until we can actually talk with the folks inside who have the programming, hear their trauma with compassion and empathy, appreciate that they kept us alive, and eventually work with them to see how they would like to change their job if they would and that can help. #ramcoasurvivor #cultsurvivor #mindcontrol  #traumatok",

If there was any hesitation or resistance it meant that we got tortured more, but also that the other kids got tortured more, and they did that especially with me because I resisted often and also it hurt me the most to have other kids be tortured or murdered. There is so much self blame and guilt (that does not belong to me) because the cult would say it was all our fault, and yet the memories of Judy who is the only one who resisted like that with me meant so much to me. Because in her and my trying not to hurt each other, in our whispering sorry when we were forced to torture each other, in our having gentle hands at the beginning of being forced to sexually assault or hurt each other meant that we were saying, I don\u0027t want to do this, I see you, I love you, I care about you, I wish this wasn\u0027t happening.

They used flesh-comoured thick silicone wrapped around our arm with packets of blood beneath that they had siphoned off earlier from us or other kids, and would have us slice through certain areas of the silicone for self-h\u00E1rm or for unaliving, and then the blood would show we\u0027d done it correctly. In between they would use needle torture, electrochock, and SA. For the training to unalive they had us cut where the arteries were and in addition to the packets of blood they would splash a bucket of blood on our face to simulate an artery gushing. They convinced those folks inside that if they killed the body they would take over. It is so important to talk with cult-created, cult-trained folks inside to help them see that if they kill the body everyone inside will be dead including them. And if they harm the body it will harm everyone inside. And that they do not need to do the things that cult taught them. They do not deserve to be hurt or to unalive themselves.

Some people will say to us cult torture survivors \u0022Where is the proof?\u0022 There is proof in our bodies, in our body memories, in our stories, and our trauma. There is proof in the DID we have that only comes from extreme, repeated ongoing childhood abuse and/or torture and all the other mental health effects that we have from the trauma such as cPTSD, suicidal ideation, anxiety and depression. And for some of us there is also proof in our bodies.\n\n I have never had a child in non-abuse, non-torture time and I have never been with a man by choice; I\u0027m a non-binary lesbian. But my doctor found evidence of my having had a child because that is something that the cult forces on us those of us with a uterus - bearing babies who are unregistered for the cult to use in the torture, the trafficking, and to sell or to murder. My first dentist that I chose found gouges in my teeth that were made from my father and other cult members who created them in the torture. I have since ground them down but they were there. And if you are so bent on finding proof you could push police and law enforcement to actually investigate the organized child corn that cults created using us survivors. You can also look at websites like ra-info.org for news articles about arrests about cult torture. But just believe survivors. It is so painful and hard for us to speak out against all the mind control and torture that was done against us and the ways that they told us no one would believe us and all the many times that we are victim blamed or not believed.

If you are a cult torture survivor and anyone tells you that you are helpless and a victim and there is no escape do not believe them. If you are a cult torture survivor and anyone tells you that you should not work with a therapist and that a therapist will not help you do not believe them. These are cues or things that are directly said in programming and cult torture. I was dismayed to hear all of these and many more cues in a recent workshop for cult torture survivors and DID systems. \n\nThere are many reasons that someone can give a cue. Programming is based on a lot of common language and phrases, body language, nursery rhymes and songs, so some people can give a cue without knowing that they are doing it. Then there are cult torture survivors who are triggered into their own programming who may inadvertently cue someone with their own programming. There are cult torture survivors who are still being accessed, so still being tortured, who are forced to set off cues for other cult torture survivors. And then there are cult members who mask socially well and who insert themselves into jobs or positions or places where they can access child or adult cult torture victims to silence them and shut them down or cover up disclosures. \n\nYou can notice  programming functioning such as your head suddenly feeling spinny or fuzzy, suddenly feeling hugely deeply despairing or hopeless or terrified and staying in that feeling and feeling like you can\u0027t get out of it, hearing some command or message repeat in a loop in your mind, seeing visuals of ways to hurt or unalive yourself.\n\nIf programming is functioning of course you can try to calm yourself down and use nervous system regulation techniques but those are often not enough. In my experience it helps to work directly with the programmed folks inside and with the program itself or the message. It helps to directly counteract the cult lies and give opposite messages. And it can help to map out your programming, the steps and who inside is to take them. I have someone inside who just like they can map out my system, there is someone else who can map out the programming; I just had to ask for their help. But if you can\u0027t get there yet if you can write out the messages that you were hearing and where it takes you to then you can work on countering those messages. It\u0027s also really important to work with those folks inside who hold the programming and work with them with compassion and empathy; they worked to help keep the body and self alive, and true compassion and empathy will always cut through the programming. \n\nFor us recognizing that the programming is functioning, why it is like the cue or who inside is giving it, can really help quiet down the programming. You can also use a lot of creativity in working with the programming, finding loopholes, and changing it. #mindcontrol #ramcoasurvivor #cultsurvivor",

As cult torture survivors we can be very wary of other people especially because most of the people in our lives who were adults were part of the cult torture, and because so many of the cult members were really good at social masking and had good jobs and looked like they should be trustworthy. So many of my cult abusers were therapists and child protective service providers and police and doctors and teachers, all in positions where they could access survivors and help to cover things up or report back on us. So we always think it\u0027s good to trust your gut--especially the first three to five seconds of first meeting someone. After that programming can cover up gut reactions, at least if it\u0027s about someone who abused us - we\u0027ve had that happen. \n\nAnd then there are some people who might be trustworthy but who are using common cues like common body language cues and it doesn\u0027t mean that they\u0027re not trustworthy; we have to watch more and ask inside more. And when we were still being tortured the cult would impersonate our two good therapists, dress like them, try to pitch their voice like them, even use similar phrases or perfume, recreate their offices, and drug us up for torture and try to convince us that\u0027s what our therapist did, or try to convince us that we had killed our therapist by speaking - all to interfere with our therapy or keep us from talking. It\u0027s so important to look at the memories folks inside bring up and then to look all the way down through the layers so that we can see past what cult wants us to believe. So it\u0027s good to trust our gut and to make sure that we look through the layers and talk with everyone inside who has something to say about it. Those things help us and we hope that they will help you too. #ramcoasurvivor #cultsurvivor #ramcoasystem",

They are not thinking or caring about our safety, yet the lives of every cult torture survivor matters. I do in many of my videos name some of the cults that were interconnected and involved, such as KKK, Nazi, and Satanic, and at least half of the population of the United Church my parents went to were part of one cult or another, and there were many other religions that trafficked and tortured us kids. But there are others that I am not going to name for my safety. And I am not going to publicly name any of my perpetrators because that would put me in danger. And I don\u0027t recommend that any cult torture Survivor do that.

When I did speak out when I was still being tortured the torture and the mind control increased, and it is amazing I am alive. 3. Many of our perpetrators are connected to or are themselves powerful people with money and power and favors and connections and they could come after us. \n\nThe few times I did go to the police it put me in more danger, and it did not end up helping any of the victims being tortured or me.\n\nOur naming names is not going to help cult torture victims being tortured now; we often don\u0027t remember all of our perpetrators and the cults are interconnected. We need systemic change where cult members in police, doctors, child protective services, victim services are removed from their jobs, and where we change laws, and survivors  are actually protected and supported. When I ran away around 17 and I ran to a shelter my cult abusers still accessed me every single night. Running away doesn\u0027t make us safe, not the first time. We need people to care about us and to dig in and to fight for change on a systemic level. And to keep talking about cult torture and trafficking and to care. If you have been hearing us and believing us, thank you. That is the first step to making change. #cultsurvivor #ramcoasurvivor #trafficking #traumahealing",

      "description": "TW: cult torture. So many people after hearing my story as a cult torture and organized trafficking Survivor for the first time ask me how they can help. \n\nWe need people to hear us survivors when we speak out, so amplifying our stories by sharing them, but also sharing them with people you know. Talking to people in your community, your family, about organized cult torture and trafficking. \n\nWe also need systemic change. We need things to change in the police, lawyers, doctors, teachers, child protective services, and adult victim services, social workers and therapists, where they are truly trauma-informed and they actually understand and know what happens in organized cults and they know the signs to look out for and they can become more educated and can protect victims sooner and hopefully actually go after the perpetrators. \n\nRight now the legal system is set up for perpetrators, and we need the legal system and the police system to change. \n\nand also educate yourself especially if you are in one of those helping professions. I have an article on the Signs and Symptoms of a Cult Torture Survivor (L1nk in B1o) which I hope you\u0027ll read and share with people in those professions. You can also read books by Alison Miller on cult torture and mind control, and Safe Passage To Healing by Chrystine Oksana; l1nks on my site. #cultsurvivor #ramcoasurvivor #trafficking #traumatok #traumahealing",

If you had them as neighbors you would think they were nice. But they were a trafficking and torturing me and other kids everyday and every night in the culture. \n\nIf you\u0027d like to help make change please amplify Survivor voices, talk about cult torture and trafficking to your friends, share our videos, and please believe survivors. If you want to look out for survivors now to provide support or to help, or if you\u0027re in a helping or policing profession please read my Signs and Symptoms of a Cult Torture Survivor l1nked in my b1o and on my website, and share it with others.

For most of my life, all the years that I was being tortured in trafficked by the cults that my parents and other family were part of I wished that someone would save me. Of course no one did and I had to save myself, and it took so long. I had to work on inner communication and cooperation with the dissociative identity so we would stop losing time. we had to work on our trauma memories and remember who abused us and be able to retain that in everyday time so that we can stay away from them. We had to run away over and over again and each time we did our abusers found us and brought us back and increase the torture in mind control but we also got a level more of safe. And we needed a good therapist who would care about us and hear us with compassion and empathy and be that anchor and challenge the programming. I wish that things were different. You can\u0027t just rescue a cult torture survivor you don\u0027t know all the cult abusers who are hiding in plain sight to keep them away from. And they likely don\u0027t know either because that\u0027s the way dissociation and programming works. And I still wish that all of us cult torture survivors had been saved and could be safe.

I did not know why I felt so sad or afraid or in pain or not wanting to be here every day until we started remembering around age 13 and someone inside me disclosed where a teacher actually listened. Then we were able to hang on to some of the memories that folks inside were telling us, and it moved from memories of incest to more grotesque and then to cult torture because we could not face it any other way. #did #ramcoasystem #dissociativeidentitydisorder #ramcoasurvivor #cultsurvivor",

This is really confusing to the child unless they split for each kind of trauma.

Beforehand I talked to everyone inside with the dissociative identity and told them that they didn\u0027t have to be there if they didn\u0027t want to. We also called on our Tough Guys and our mothering and wise folks. And then at the appointment I told the nurse that I\u0027m a cult torture survivor and that my abusers used to dress up as doctors and nurses and used medical equipment for torture, and she was able to hear me, which helped. And then for the scan she did not strap my arms down even though that\u0027s normally done; she allowed us to just tuck our hands under our thighs which helped, and she told us to close our eyes for the scanner and she put a tissue box on our chest after finding out that we were a little claustrophobic so that the scanner wouldn\u0027t come as close to our face, and those things helped. But still we got triggered down to being paralyzed by drugs and locked in a coffin and buried underground, which the cult did to us often. And folks inside after the drug wore off pounding the lid of the coffin and wanting to do the same thing with the scanner. But we got through; we were just really wiped, and it helped a lot to have both inner cooperation and folks inside helping out, some objects that helped us feel stronger and calmer, and a kind nurse. #cultsurvivor #ramcoasurvivor #ramcoasystem #plural #dissociativeidentitydisorder",

They did everything they could to try and prevent us from remembering, talking, believing ourself, and having internal communication. The cult is calculated and deliberate and cruel.

Right before a second meeting we\u0027d had a zoom that was incredibly triggering and brought us to despair. We\u0027d been crying, but we wanted to go to the next meeting and be professional, so I called on my educator parts, information parts, therapist parts and wise parts and pulled them out, and we were able to be there in the meeting really professionally, helping out, although our hands and legs shook but they couldn\u0027t see that, and we did dig our nails into our hands which isn\u0027t the best coping but we were still able to be there which is what we wanted. But it was so familiar to me that switching from trauma or what reminded us of trauma into everyday parts coping which is what we had to do often from the torture to going to school, although I don\u0027t remember deliberately being called out or having folks called out for everyday time but I know that we were taught to by cult. #ramcoasurvivor #ramcoasystem #plural #dissociativeidentitydisorder",

I have a messed up relationship with food (though I don\u0027t think we have an eating disorder) because of all the cult torture, all the times that they forced us to ingest things that no one should ever have to ingest, and all the times in the summer and other times when they would starve us for weeks or a month or close to two months and then force feed us. We can\u0027t ever miss a meal because of that, although some parts of me because they went through the starvation are familiar with it and can go there. And we are also affected by all the times they forced us to ingest horrific things like human flesh after murder, and our own feces and vomit and blood and that of others. I have to be a vegetarian because of that and I tried to even as a child even though I wasn\u0027t allowed to. I can\u0027t consume red things especially liquidy or I have to change the color like putting ground up chickpeas into spaghetti sauce. I have weeks or months when I will have the same thing because it is comforting and it\u0027s like a safe food for me but some of that might also be the autism. There\u0027s lots of textures I can\u0027t handle and a lot of that relates back to the cult torture but some of it might also be the autism. We try to eat healthy but we have to have chocolate because it feels like a form of comfort but also helps my mood. I know I\u0027m not the only cult of torture survivor who has a messed up relationship with food because of the torture, and makes so much sense that we do. It\u0027s good to deal with it as we can as slowly as we need to. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok",

I don\u0027t understand how they could torture us on an emotional and and soul level, but I do know that the cult tried to stamp out our compassion and empathy repeatedly and deliberately through torture scenario,s and that the cult members would have gone through the same or similar programming when they were kids. I know this because the cults were intergenerational; I remember my great-grandparents, my grandparents, and my parents all being part of the cult torture, but at some point they made a choice to become cult and to not fight back. And the cult would reward the victims who learned to torture more easily with less torture or more privilege. The adult cult members would also get off on our pain and terror sexually and emotionally. And they also gained money and favors and power. But beyond that I don\u0027t understand how they could do something so cruel and inhumane.

So it can help to talk to those folks inside who hold on to that emotion or memory and ask if there\u0027s anything that they can do to gain comfort that will not hurt the body or anyone else, and to use techniques like EFT tapping and even positive distraction, writing or drawing it out, and of course talking about it and being heard with compassion and empathy which can help cut through the programming. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok #plural #dissociativeidentitydisorder",

      "description": "TW: cult torture, detail. The cults that tortured me and other kids, teens, and adults  (KKK, Nazi, \u0026 Satanic among others) used all the forms of torture that they could - physical, sexual, psychological, spiritual.  They also used sensory torture. For physical torture they would do things like needles and electric shock and hanging us by our limbs and spinning us and suffocation and drowning then reviving, looking us up in small spaces like coffins or boxes and sensory deprivation. But they also used sensory overwhelm/torture where they would put me in a room and send through the speakers such loud noise or screaming music, metal music, that it physically hurt my eardrums and I could feel it in my bones and it felt unbearable, while flashing the lights on and off, and then applying some physical or sexual torture. It made me feel dizzy and sick and in pain. I am neurodivergent in multiple ways, with the DID as well as autism and ADHD, and I can get sensory overload with loud continuous noises so this felt torturous on an additional level. And sometimes now when I get sensory overloaded and it feels too overwhelming I don\u0027t know if it is because of the torture or because I\u0027m autistic or because I\u0027m triggered or all of those things. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok #plural",

      "description": "TW: cult torture. Many cult torture survivors and their therapists when they first realize that the survivor has had mind control used against them get afraid and think that it is all powerful. but it is not. We can overcome mind control, we can override it, we can lessen its effects. I always fought back against mind control and the core programs of not talking about the torture, not remembering it, not believing it. I started remembering the child sexual abuse at 13, the cult torture at 15, and I made art and wrote articles and sent them into survivor newsletters, and had my art up at conferences and a traveling art show, and published in a newspaper and journals, and posted some of the articles on my website. All those years I was still being tortured and spoke out the cult increased the torture and the mind control but they couldn\u0027t stop me from speaking out. Some programming I still hear like words in my head to kill myself and I know that it goes down to the torture and the mind control. Many days it is just words and then other days when there are too many cues or triggers it gets more intense but I can work with the folks inside who hold on to that. We can always work with the folks inside hold onto the programming, listen to what they went through, change their jobs, and keep working on healing. We are more powerful than mind control which was put in through hate. Compassion and love and healing help change it. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #mindcontrol #traumatok",

The cult would pretend to be kind and loving and hug us, and then  tell us that our hug or our touch was killing them or hurting them or was giving them permission to sexually assault us or hurt us, and then they would sexually assault us or hurt us. They were trying to keep us from trusting other people and getting safety with other people. So some folks inside me with the dissociative identity who went through that take a really long time to trust other people with safe touch and hugs. But when they do, after watching and listening for a long time and seeing that the person really is safe, and they front in with me in my body to actually get a hug then it can feel really healing on a deep level. It sounds like a little thing but safe touch and hugs are the opposite for us of sexual assault and torture and cult. They are healing. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok",

      "description": "TW: cult torture. The cults that tortured me, especially the Satanic and Christian cults, often deliberately created folks inside with the dissociative identity and made them believe through repeated torture and mind control that they were demons or monsters or vampires or less than human in order to make those folks inside believe that no one should love them or ever could ever love them, that they deserved the torture, the extreme ongoing torture that was happening to them, so they would be more bonded with and more loyal to the cult because they would identify with the cult, that they would keep from making bonds with other people because they felt like they were less than human or so despicable or horrific that they deserved the torture and didn\u0027t deserve to bond with anybody or have compassion or empathy. Those insiders are split off parts of my psyche just like everyone else inside with the dissociative identity. They have been through some of the most extreme ongoing torture and mind control, and they helped the system and the body survive, they helped us survive by keeping us alive, by taking on that job and role, by allowing themselves to be convinced by cult that they were demons or monsters or less than human because the cult would not stop the torture and the mind control until someone inside took on those beliefs, those roles, those jobs.\n\nBut they\u0027re not actually demons or monsters are less than human; they\u0027re part of my mind and body and soul, they are part of me. And it\u0027s so easy to see when you talk to them with compassion and empathy and respect; they start to change their job and become some of the strongest protectors inside. They have so much goodness in them. They took on the jobs that no one else inside could, they took on so much extreme torture and repeated mind control and helped keep us alive. They deserve our respect and our compassion and empathy in working with them. And to do something like an exorcism when they are not demons or monsters or less than human would traumatize them, traumatize the whole entire system and me, would hurt them and all of us, would hurt them and us emotionally, psychologically, and would reinforce the cult messages that they are demons or monsters or less than human. They need compassion and love and empathy. And we can see by how they respond that they are part of the self, part of the soul, part of the mind and body. They wanted us to stay alive, they wanted us to survive the torture and get through, and that\u0027s why they took on the job because they had to. They\u0027re not demons, they\u0027re not monsters, they\u0027re not less than human; they\u0027re part of me and deserve to be heard and to be respected and to be treated kindly and with compassion.

They use both to try and stamp out our compassion and empathy, and make us more loyal to the cult. For those of us who had to be repeatedly forced to torture and sexually assault and murder they put us repeatedly in the victim position. But for other kids they gave them praise and told them they would get rewarded by moving up in the cult and gain power if they could torture and sexually assault and murder, and lose their compassion. Of course kids want safety and to belong and to have praise and to be tortured less, and many kids tried to gain that which makes sense. Cults even use the phrase \u0022the Chosen One\u0022 or being special which is popularized in our society and so we will often hear those phrases and have it reinforce mind control about that. But as a child and a teen we were forced to do horrible things in cult torture and it was never our fault. And for many of us who were still tortured as adults we again did not have a choice as one adult trying to fight back against many, and experiencing torture on a daily nightly basis. But if we are healing now that makes such a huge difference. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #mindcontrol #traumahealing",

      "description": "TW: cult torture, detail. The cult made me forget about our DID system maps.\nI have so much grief and anger over everything the cult did to me, all the torture and mind control and trafficking, the ways they intentionally impacted my brain through the trauma and torture and the deliberate creation of DID. But now I have something new that I\u0027ve remembered. \n\n20 years ago I was mapping my DID system with folks inside who hold that knowledge and were helping me. I was still being tortured and my partner at the time who was part of cult saw that I was mapping my system, tortured and sexually assaulted me, and told the cult. They tortured me over and over and used increased mind control to metaphorically cut the awareness of the system maps out of my brain and I forgot about them. For 20 years I didn\u0027t know about them. \n\nI think that the cult did this because they wanted to interfere with internal communication and cooperation because that helps us stop losing time and get safe sooner. But also because my insiders are named by job so I can see by looking at the system maps the programming or the torture or the abuse scenarios that were done to create them, and there are also descriptions in the mapping. And I can see where the cult made cult-created parts off of my self-made parts and some ones who are very dear to me. \n\n I still didn\u0027t remember the system maps, the only reason I found them is because I was looking for a scan of a hand drawn system map that I have made with my therapist, and I found these files. Thankfully I had hidden them enough in all the file folders and made multiple copies of my entire computer and just copied them over to my laptops over the years. I feel so much grief and anger and betrayal that the cult kept knowledge from me of my own system. I\u0027m grateful I found them now and I can use them in my healing but there is grief about it. How much further could I have gone in my healing if I had still stayed aware of them 20 years ago? #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #plural #dissociativeidentitydisorder #mindcontrol",

The cult torture and trafficking happened in so many places - the formal rituals and torture in the middle of the night outside the city in deserted fields or in forests in clearings, on private land, or in large parks in clearings or graveyards. The torture \u0026 SA also happened in warehouses or buildings where every room was used by the cult, in basements of some do-gooder organizations, in bunkers, in tunnels, and some military buildings or decommissioned military buildings. And some of the mass sexual assault and orgies happened in private clubs or church basements like the one that my parents went to every Sunday. The trafficking also happened in warehouses where they separated some of the basement into stalls that they made to look like children\u0027s bedrooms with beds and teddy bears and recording devices. But for very rich clients the trafficking would happen on private airplanes where they would be SAing and torturing us, or by taking us to their homes or businesses. It was very organized, and the interconnected intergenerational cults, KKK, Nazi, and Satanic, among others, shared resources, victims, torture techniques and mind control techniques, and also sold some of those techniques to other cults or to abusers who would pay them a high fee. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok",

I grew up being cult tortured in a good neighborhood in Toronto that is liberal leaning and progressive, and you\u0027d think that people there would be more aware of the signs of abuse and trauma but they were not. I think most people expect that cult torture and trafficking happens in compounds or isolated or disreputable neighborhoods but it can be happening right under your nose in good neighborhoods where the kids go to public school and the families look presentable. My parents held a good jobs, they looked overprotective in how much they were involved in my life and controlled who I could talk to and how they appeared concerned. Cult members are so good at social masking; they have to be so they aren\u0027t detected. My parents went to church every Sunday, they volunteered and they knew mostly the right things to say. I\u0027m not giving more information about the neighborhood I grew up in because I am careful to not give identifying information for my safety; it took me most of my life to get safe. I do not want the cult to threaten me more or cue me and try to set off programming or try to actively get me back as they have over the years. So I put my safety first and I hope all survivors do. I hope so much that people will hear and believe survivors more and that more survivors will get safe sooner. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok",

      "description": "TW: cult torture. When people first hear that I grew up being tortured by cult they often assume that meant that I grew up in a compound or very isolated - but I grew up in busy Toronto. My parents sent me to public school but there was always at least one adult in the schools, they sent me to extracurricular activities like skating where they had me and skimpy outfits and swimming but they either stayed or there was a cult adult there. They sent me to Brownies, Girl Guides, CGIT, same thing. They did limit who I came into contact with and would have just looked like overprotective parents. They also limited what I consumed of media; for years and years they only allowed me to watch children\u0027s shows like Sesame street, Mr Dressup, Polka Dot Door even when I was 12, 13. But after I disclosed child sexual abuse of a great uncle they gradually loosened that somewhat. But kids at school would be singing pop songs or talking about actors or celebrities and I didn\u0027t know what they were talking about. My parents looked good on a superficial level, they had good paying jobs, they went to church, they volunteered regularly, they knew mostly the right things to say. Unless you really trusted your gut and paid close attention to body language you wouldn\u0027t know something was off but even then you wouldn\u0027t know cult torture. The way you might know better is by looking at the signs and symptoms I showed as a cult torture survivor, such as those in my article linked in my bio and on my website. People can be cult tortured and trafficked in your community, people you know. Please believe and hear survivors. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #trafficking #traumatok",

I thought it was my own coping mechanism to suppress overwhelming memories or emotions or keep from unaliving myself, and it was, and I was also taught to do it. My father made the first real, deep cuts in my arm, holding my hand over the handle of an xacto knife as he cut and told us when to do it. Before that they started my training around 2 or 3, first on mannequin limbs, then on actual limbs, then when we were around 3 or 4 strapped to torture chairs with layers of silicone wrapped around my arm and packets of real blood beneath that they had siphoned off me or other kids. I think they taught us this because we resisted them and fought them over and over and they had to force us to hurt other kids through torture. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #plural #dissociativeidentitydisorder #traumatok",

People who didn\u0027t survive cult torture often don\u0027t understand why cults do what they do, such as intentionally creating robot personalities or parts inside by doing fake surgeries to convince the child that we are a robot that the cult can control our every thought, every movement, our emotions or keep us from having emotions, that the cult can track us. The cult does this to control us and to keep us silent, to keep us obedient to the cult because that allows the cult to continue their torture and trafficking and murder. And if the child does try to speak out who is going to believe us when we say that the we had surgery to make us into a robot? The cult does this because they make a huge amount of money off of us through the trafficking, not only of sexual assault but also of torture, and the child p0rn0gr\u00E0phy. And they get power from it, from favors from rich people or politicians for trafficking us to them. And robots photo commands so we just submit to the torture and trafficking. So many of the cult members get off on the power they have over us, and get off on the torture and sexual assault and making us terrified. It is about power and ensuring that the cult can continue to do what they do. What the cult does is always to benefit them. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #plural #dissociativeidentitydisorder",

      "description": "TW: cult torture. It\u0027s important to have compassion for cult-created insiders with the DID/being plural. For me the cult would not stop the torture until they managed to create a split who would take on the job and the name that the cult was asking. There was no way out except to create those parts. So I have a part of me who\u0027s only job is to take on the torture and submit to it, be submissive, and all she knows is torture, and I have multiple parts split off from her because the cult kept creating that job and role. I have so much compassion empathy for her. It is horrible to only know torture, but they did what we couldn\u0027t. And so I work with her and the others to help them see through my eyes here is through my ears and see that we are safe now and they don\u0027t have to keep doing that job or be caught in the trauma loop and maybe they can find things they want to do they will bring them some comfort or joy in the present. It helps to have compassion even for the folks inside that we might dislike or even be scared of, like for me the cult-created folks who put forth programming to unalive myself or hurt myself. Again they endured torture and took on the job that no one else inside could but we had to to stay alive and survive the torture. So it helps to work with them with compassion and empathy which cuts through the mind control because the mind control and torture was done with hate. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #plural #systok #dissociativeidentitydisorder",

I don\u0027t think the cult even had to go to that level to make us not be believed since so many people don\u0027t even want to believe and hear survivors of sexual assault or child sexual abuse and they victim blame.

But even as children so often many of us could see through the fake abuse scenarios and murder scenarios, because the actual murder that happens is so different from the fake ones. It\u0027s different on every sensory level. A lot of murder happens. One way that the cults can get away with so much murder that they force victims and cult members with uteruses to bear babies who unregistered for the use of the cult. There are ways to see through the fake scenarios and it takes looking at the memories with compassion and empathy. And it also takes looking at the many murders that did happen with compassion empathy and support. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok",

Working with cult-created insiders.\nFor two days I have had cult-created folks inside send me two nursery rhymes or pop songs that are cues for programming to keep me silent, not talking about the cult torture. I asked them why and they said because I was talking about it. Which means to me that they have not been around for a very long time because I have been talking about it since I was 15 and first started remembering, and I also educated at conferences and survivor newsletters and with people who worked with me and wrote articles on my website for years. So I talked with them and asked if they could see through my eyes and hear through my ears and see that we weren\u0027t being accessed or tortured anymore, if they could stay aware through my eyes and ears and see that no one is accessing us at night or ever. There was a startled silence and then they started up again but at least I know they were listening and it made them think, and I will keep talking to them. Sometimes challenging inner folks to see the present is what helps them stop their old cukt-trained behavior. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #plural #systok #dissociativeidentitydisorder",

The cults teaches victims that we are unlovable, and worse that we are hateable or that we will hurt other people by loving them or touching them. They teach this and reinforce this in so many ways. One of the ways is when we are a child to completely ignore us to pretend that they can\u0027t see us can\u0027t hear us, saying we are so disgusting or hateable or evil that they can\u0027t even bear to be around us and everyone ignores us. This is traumatic for children since children are dependent on adults for survival. Another way they do this is by telling us repeatedly that we will hurt or kill others by caring about them or touching them and then when we try to help or touch someone in the cult they pretend that that person has been horrifically hurt or killed. All of this is cruel and intentional to try and keep kids silent and from reaching out and to blame themselves instead of the cult. It is psychological manipulation and a form of torture. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok",

      "description": "TW: cult torture, mind control, believing the cult can see and hear everything.\n\nSomething that the cults who tortured me and other kids frequently did was try to make us believe through mind control, torture, creation of specific folks inside with the dissociative identity, and elaborate abuse scenarios that they were all seeing and all hearing and would know everything we said and did, especially if we broke a rule. They did this through elaborate abuse scenarios of fake surgeries where they would pretend to implant a microchip or a recording device in us, in conjunction with creating inner folks who would report back to the cult on everything that we did it or said especially if it broke any rules such as trying to talk to someone about the abuse and torture, remembering the abuse and torture or believing it, having folks inside communicate with each other who weren\u0027t supposed to, etc. \n\nSo for those folks inside who were not aware of those inner folks who reported back, they believed that the cult was all powerful and could see and hear everything that we did, because how could the cult possibly know that we tried to tell or escape or heal or talk inside when the cult wasn\u0027t present? But it was because of those cult created and cult trained reporter folks who were taught to do their job by torture. \n\nSo it takes working with those inner reporters to see that they don\u0027t have to do the job that they are taught through torture, and that also means hearing them about the torture and mind control that they went through. It means working on inner communication and cooperation. And for me it also meant hiding some folks inside and some knowledge inside from those reporter parts so that the cult.wouldn\u0027t know about pieces of our healing. And it could also mean giving the reporter parts specific information that we agreed upon that the cult could know that wasn\u0027t not as deep as the things we were trying to protect. It can also help to ask everyone inside to look out through the eyes and listen with the ears when we are with someone safe or who is giving us love and compassion and see that it is so much better and it is worth fighting for and trying to escape for. Those things helped me and I hope they help you, too. \n#mindcontrol #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #plural #dissociativeidentitydisorder",

      "description": "TW: cult torture. Cult makes inner folks think they\u0027re dead.\n\nSomething the cult frequently does is make inside folks with the dissociative identity believe that they are dead. They do this to control folks inside, to make them obedient because no one else inside wants to be killed, so to make sure that the cult-created or cult-trained folks inside do their jobs of making sure that we don\u0027t remember, that we don\u0027t talk about the abuse and trauma, that if we do we don\u0027t believe it, or other jobs like that.\n\nBut another reason that the cult would make inner folks believe that they\u0027re dead is to link up to other programming, to suicidal or self-harm programming. Because if the folks inside believe that they are dead, yet they are still thinking and feeling, then they think it\u0027s not a big deal if they encourage others inside to actually kill the body. They don\u0027t understand that if the body is dead then everybody inside will be permanently dead. And so they are more willing to put forth programming to kill the body.\n\nBut you can\u0027t kill folks inside. As long as the brain is alive and the body is alive you can\u0027t kill inside folks because they are part of the brain and the body and it\u0027s where they live. It\u0027s where we all live. \n\nBut cults can convince folks inside that they are dead and they do this through elaborate abuse scenarios where they pretend to kill the child and then they drug the child so the child is paralyzed can\u0027t move and then they have an elaborate funeral and then bury the child in a coffin, or they actually kill the body through electroshock or suffocation and then resuscitate the child, and the cult is constantly telling them that they are dead. \n\nAnd then the cult will often enlist the help of cult-trained or cult-created folks inside to make that part believe they are dead and make others inside believe they are dead, make them invisible to others inside or not be able to be heard or seen, buried inside, put in elaborate structures or locks, etc. But they\u0027re still alive and still there and it is just finding a way to work with the programming and the old messages and helping them communicate. \n\nI think it\u0027s important to help the folks who believe they\u0027re dead realize that they\u0027re not, especially if they\u0027re the ones putting forth suicidal or self-harm programming. So it really helps to work with them. \n#cultsurvivor #ramcoa #plural #dissociativeidentitydisorder #mindcontrol",

      "description": "TW: cult torture, forcing kids to hurt other kids. The cults that tortured me frequently forced us kids to hurt each other - to SA and torture each other and sometimes kill each other. The cults did this to control us, to make us afraid and obedient and silent, to keep us silent by making us feel like we were also a perpetrator and it was our fault and make us feel shame and blame, to try and break us and break our souls, to try to stamp out compassion and empathy, to try and make us eventually become part of the cults. They also did this during chikd p0rn0gr\u00E0phy and child prostitution to gain money and power and favors from rich people, politicians and people in positions of power, and from other cults.\n\nThe cult wants us to feel shame and blame ourselves and hate ourselves for what they forced us to do. But the shame and blame and self-hate does not belong to us; it belongs to our abusers and the adults who forced us to do what we did. We were powerless, we were children, and even if we fought back we could not overpower or stop the adults. Often survivors forget this, especially those of us who are plural or live with DID because many of our protector and other folks inside feel like adults because the trauma made us feel so old, but were created when the body was a child. But even as a teen or adult, one adult cannot overpower the group of adult abusers who are intent on torture and murder and have done that many times before and do torture us. \n\nIt can help to look at a child and adult together where the child was the age you were and see how incredibly powerless and vulnerable they really are. We were innocent, we were blameless, it was never ever our fault and that\u0027s important to hang on to that.\n#cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok #plural #dissociativeidentitydisorder",

Often when people hear about the cult torture and the trafficking I survived one of the first things they will ask is if my abusers were arrested, if there was justice, if they went to prison, but it\u0027s not as easy as people think. \n\nFirst, the legal system is set up for perpetrators, not victims and it can be incredibly re-traumatizing. Then think of how often people don\u0027t even want to believe about child sexual abuse or sexual assault of an adult; when it gets down to trafficking and cult torture and it is more extreme even less people want to believe and hear. \n\nAnd often our abusers are also part of law enforcement, child protective services or children\u0027s aid society, doctors, nurses and they are part of covering it up or preventing investigations or if there are investigations interfering with those investigations. Our abusers are incredibly good at social masking, they are well educated and well dressed and have good jobs and often are influential in society. \n\nAlso in order to survive the torture and trafficking and repeated SA often we had to repress and forget the memories and what happened, especially with dissociative identity; it\u0027s the only way that we could survive such trauma and torture. \n\nAnd for many of us we lived with our abusers. I lived with my abuser parents who told me they would kill me if I talked and they murdered kids in front of me and I knew they could. They are so intentionally created splits in me with dissociative identity to keep me from talking and remembering. There is also mind control used to keep us silent and repeated threats and it is incredibly well organized. \n\nIt took me most of my life to get safe and that included running away multiple times, being found and brought back, and it included me having to remember who abused me because of the dissociation and get safe from them and again it took me most of my life to get safe. And then it\u0027s not like we have somebody who is supporting us and helping us get through (and many survivors can\u0027t afford trauma informed therapy) and even if we do the legal system is not set up for survivors. \n\nAnd if we do speak out while we are still being tortured the cult increases the torture and the mind control; that repeatedly happened to me. And then you look at all the effects of the trauma, sometimes all we can do is just survive.\n\nThere\u0027s so many things that prevent survivors from getting justice. I didn\u0027t even hope for it. I just hoped to get safe and it still took me most of my life. We need systemic change to help survivors. What I do is speak out and educate in the ways I can and write the books and articles I do. #trafficking #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #plural #dissociativeidentitydisorder",

And not just trafficking for regular SA but also for S\u0026M, and for trafficking that caused pain or torture, and then more extreme trafficking where they actually taught people how to torture on us. The cult gained money and power and favors and prestige through the trafficking. And then my parents who were part of the cult also regularly gave me to other people in the church who were cult or other cults as a favor for them to SA me. \n\nBut most people looking at me would not have been able to see it unless they were really good at body language and were trauma informed, and then they would have seen my fear and my dissociation and my immediate obedience. But most people don\u0027t look past the superficial layer. They would only see how well my parents presented, that we were dressed well, and the good jobs the cult held and the positions of authority and power they had. We need more education, we need better laws, we need law enforcement to actually help survivors and not perpetrators. We need survivors speaking out and we need people to hear us with compassion and empathy. So my way to help is by speaking out, by educating, to help other survivors know they\u0027re not alone, to help mental health practitioners and people who work with us to be better, and to also help the general public gain awareness. #trafficking #cultsurvivor #ramcoa",

Inner kids especially can sometimes still be scared. It makes sense when so much of the formal rituals and torture and mind control happened at night in cult torture. Some happened in the day but so much happened at night in a formal way. I\u0027ve worked through a lot of it and now even have blackout curtains to block the light from the neighboring building and we are okay with it as long as we can still make out things in the room. But it helps to do things like sleep with a giant Squishmallow that a dear friend gave us, and a weighted blanket, and butterfly stickers on the wall, and to remind folks inside that this is the present not the past. But on nights when we are really triggered it can still be hard but most of the time it\u0027s okay now.

But there was no bomb or implanted device. All of these were elaborate abuse scenarios to convince us that the cult was all powerful, invincible, and that we would be killed if we talked. All of it was for the benefit of the cult to allow the trafficking and the cult torture to continue and to keep us silent and afraid. It is hard for children to see the difference when the tools and the setting is all the same, when it\u0027s the same kind of metal table that is used in surgery and the cult are wearing doctors\u0027 and nurses\u0027 uniforms and there is elaborate medical equipment and there is actual pain and actual blood even though it is not our blood. I could see through it and so could other folks inside me but the personalities that the cult created could not see through it because they had to believe it in order for us to survive because the cult demanded that. So it is working with those folks inside who believe it to show them that it was not true and we are safe. we can heal, we can remember, we can get safe and we can talk about cult torture. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok #plural #dissociativeidentitydisorder",

      "description": "TW: cult torture, mind control \u0026 self cues. If you are also a cult torture survivor or you are working with or love someone who is, did you know that there are self cues to set off mind control messages? Cult trained some folks inside through repeated torture to use those cues on us. It helps to notice the body language that we are using on ourselves and then to notice when we start spiraling into messages to not look at our memories, to silence us, to not believe ourselves, such as  suddenly and repeatedly thinking that we made it all up, that none of it\u0027s true, etc.\n\n I have had folks inside recently trying to stop me from looking at memories, and one of the things that they do as a self-cue is to slide our hand or two fingers and thumb down our eyes and face. If you think of where that comes from, how often people close someone\u0027s eyelids who has died, it is very symbolic. You may find that you have similar self cues as well. \n\nIt helps me to notice and to pay attention when someone inside does that, and when the old mind control messages start to come back at us. While I have empathy for them because they were taught this through torture I want to interrupt it and change their job over time because mind control is only to benefit the cult and hurt us. So it helps me to notice and pay attention when it is happening. I hope this helps you, too. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #mindcontrol #plural #dissociativeidentitydisorder",

There are so many decorations that people use that are from what happens in cult torture like cut off limbs and bloody hands and people in black cloaks and skeletons and skulls and so much more. They don\u0027t know how triggering Halloween is for me and I don\u0027t want them to know yet, maybe when they are adults. But it would be spending time with chosen family, with them and their parents. We do have a Superman outfit that our tough guys like and a butterfly-ish fairy outfit that our inner kids and inner fairies like. And if I do go out with them I will have a lot of chocolate afterwards (which I would do anyway) and process the triggers. I crave chocolate a lot more during September and October leading up to Halloween because it was the only positive thing around Halloween that we had as a kid and it does feel like it helps my brain a bit and is comforting. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #plural",

There\u0027s a physiological reason why it\u0027s so painful; I have a lot of scar tissue from all the SA and the tools that they used and scar tissue does not stretch and a lot of doctors are unaware of this. And then there is the trigger of SA and how it feels like a violation of the soul and how much I had that happen and how often every day and night of my life for most of my life. Even though she used the child speculum it still hurt so much. \n\nI did a lot of things to try and help everyone inside and we prepared and yet we still made noise and said that it hurts. We felt so much shame about that because we were taught not to make noise or react through the torture by the cult. And we still don\u0027t for most kinds of pain even when it is that bad or worse but we did for this I think because it is so triggering of SA. Like we didn\u0027t react when the IV went through our vein recently and we don\u0027t react to other forms of pain.\n\n I think if men had to get pap smears we would already have a painless way to do it and we would have a lot more research. I think anything medical for women or assigned female at birth folks is understudied or not studied at all and I wish it was different. \n\n I hurt all day and I bled some and I think it\u0027s because she shoved the speculum of me because I wasn\u0027t paying and she wanted to get it over with.\n\nSo I made sure to have warm tea and a sweet drink afterward and I had a zoom call with some hopeful news and so it wasn\u0027t all a hard day. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok #plural",

I often hear survivors and mental health practitioners talking about how denial can be self-protective, and while it absolutely can, while we may not be ready to face certain aspects of the trauma or even our own DID, it can also be programming/mind control. Cults often use mind control to make us doubt ourselves so that we don\u0027t talk about it, so that we don\u0027t remember more, so that we don\u0027t stop them - all programming is about what will benefit the cult. So if you hear a lot of messages inside about you made it all up or you\u0027re lying or you\u0027re just doing it for attention or to manipulate then it may be a good idea to consider if it is programming and to counteract those messages. Nobody makes up the trauma that we live with, the body memories, the visual flashes, all the many many effects of the trauma including being DID or dissociative, the effects in our bodies and all the triggers we love with and hard times of year based on cult calendars,  nobody lives in the depression and despair and anxiety and trauma that we live in without there being a root cause. We can use denial intentionally if we need to to get through but it can also be really important to see if it is programming and to talk to the folks inside who hold that or to counter the messages. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #mindcontrol #plural #dissociativeidentitydisorder",

That is programming but I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s also how he felt during the torture and how so many folks inside felt during the torture. So I invited him to talk to me by writing or drawing or talking out loud to me. It is important to do but it is a lot easier to do with the support of a good therapist; it is harder on our own but it is still possible. But I was so glad that he talked a lot to me in his own voice because some parts inside especially with programming try to make their voices sound like my voice or my thoughts so that I won\u0027t question it as much and believe it more. I\u0027ve also noticed that some folks inside get hyperfocused at night before bed or try to drag out the bedtime because night time is scary because that\u0027s when more of the formal rituals and torture happened. #cultsurvivor #mindcontrol #plural #dissociativeidentitydisorder",

But those cult-created, cult-trained parts were also created to keep me alive. The cult would not have allowed us to survive if they had not been able to create cult-created folks with jobs to hurt, control, and silence us. So it was still about survival. \n\nAnd those cult-created folks inside experienced some of the worst and most ongoing torture and mind control and allowed the rest of us to survive, and it is working with them with compassion and empathy and respect and challenging them about the lies the cult told them that has allowed them to change inside from their cult-created jobs to becoming protectors. \n\nThe problems that I have like the triggers in the world are from the torture that was done to us, not from the dissociative identity. The dissociative identity is what kept us alive and allowed us to keep hold of our sanity and compassion and empathy and even our trauma memories and helped us to stay alive, and I am so grateful for everyone inside. we have intercooperation and intercommunication and functional dissociative identity. #plural #systok #cultsurvivor #dissociativeidentity  #dissociativeidentitydisorder",

      "description": "TW: cult torture, dental. I have a dentist appointment today which is incredibly triggering because my father and other cult used dental tools on me for torture - it can cause extreme pain with the nerves without being something that most people see. There were actual gouges in my teeth that my first dentist found before I ground them down because I grind my teeth at night. I do many things to cope and try to make it easier. Beforehand with my dissociative identity I tell anyone inside who doesn\u0027t want to be there that they don\u0027t have to, and I intentionally draw on protector parts of me as well as some parenting parts and wise ones. I take Arnica 30 CH which is homeopathic remedy for triggers before I go. I bring my safe bag with little superhero figures and things for all the senses that are calming or grounding for me. I have a superhero figure in my pocket and I hold it during the appointment, and a stone and a weighted sand filled toy in my other pocket that feels grounding. I get them to put on the weighted apron that is for x-rays because the weight helps me be calmer. I wear superhero socks to make us feel like we have armor and sometimes I visualize having armor or white or gold light around us. We may dissociate a little bit on purpose or because we are so triggered but we don\u0027t lose time and we\u0027re still aware we\u0027re at the dentist. We remind ourselves that this is the present not the past and he\u0027s not going to intentionally hurt us. I wear a fidget ring and fidget with it. And I work on my writing or read a book in the waiting room because it helps to calm me down. Those are some things that help me that might help you, too if you have similar experiences. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok #traumahealing",

      "description": "TW: cult torture. In the cult torture I survived with the intergenerational, interconnected KKK, Nazi, and Satanic cults that my parents and extended family were a part of, I saw them deliberately and calculatedly try to stamp out all compassion and empathy from us kids and make us harden our hearts, try to force us to enjoy hurting each other or at least be devoid of emotion, and become replicas of the cult, become cult members when we were adults. It was deliberate, extreme, and calculated and I saw so many kids become like the cult and make the choice to enjoy it or to seek out hurting others because that meant they got hurt less and they gained more benefits in the cult torture. But there were always some of us who fought back in the ways we could. And I believe that there is hope and healing for those who could keep hold of some compassion. But I don\u0027t believe that most of cult ever can; they do not have any compassion or empathy like my parents and extended family. \n\nTo get safe I believe it is important to remember who our abusers are and cut off contact with them, have internal cooperation and communication so that we can remember and retain the information and work on our healing. Compassion and empathy can cut through hate and mind control programming and be so powerful. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumahealing #traumatok",

      "description": "TW: cult torture. The naturopath who did my IV learned about high pain tolerance in cult torture survivors this week. She put in my IV and it seemed all good and I was working on my book. Part way through I noticed an intense stinging sensation, but it wasn\u0027t really high pain and it wasn\u0027t torture pain and I didn\u0027t want to bother her for that. But when she came in when it was almost done I mentioned it and she got me a hot pack, and then later when she was about to remove things she said \u0022Oh Cheryl, you have such a high pain tolerance. We\u0027ve never seen such a big lump,\u0022 where it went through into my flesh; it was about the size of three golf balls but not as high. She kept repeating in a shocked voice that I had such a high pain tolerance. I did not understand why she was shocked when I have told her I\u0027m a cult torture survivor and I have a high pain tolerance. I asked her what normal people would have done and she said they would have been banging on the bell repeatedly after the first or second drop went through. I still didn\u0027t understand her shock because I thought I\u0027d been very clear so I asked my friend who\u0027s also a cult torture survivor and she said the naturopath has probably only seen regular people\u0027s high pain tolerance which is very different from a cult torture survivor\u0027s high pain tolerance, and maybe it was the first time she\u0027d seen that. I am trying to be more in my body and if it had been my regular naturopath who I feel really safe with I think I would have been able to tell her sooner. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok",

It triggers so much of the sexual assault for me, where the men were rough and tore me, where the women used tools and daggers, and where I have so much internal scarring. Scar tissue doesn\u0027t stretch, and I can\u0027t relax or unclench for a pap smear which means it hurts more. And the more I am in my body since I have been safe the less I can completely dissociate and I start to react more and I find that hard. My doctor knows I\u0027m a cult torture and sexual assault survivor and she tries to do the least possible and it still hurts so much. So I will take a Hulk toy and hold it, I may try to dissociate some and I will try to remind myself it\u0027s the present not the past. But I still find it really really triggering but it is good to do for our health. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok",

Drink my blood, drink that of other child victims, even of people that they murdered. They said that it gave them control over our souls, and that it gave them vitality and energy. I don\u0027t know that the cult actually believed that it gave them control over our souls or gave them more energy or life force, but it was grotesque and something I wanted to run away from and couldn\u0027t, and it\u0027s hard to know the truth (that it\u0027s just torture, nothing all powerful) when you\u0027re a child being overwhelmed by torture. I also think it is something that the cult does to try to discredit us if we remember and talk, that people wouldn\u0027t believe. But it is a common thing that cult does and it is grotesque. I struggle especially this time of year because closer to Halloween there are so many decorations and imagery about blood. but I struggle all year with it. I can\u0027t and drink anything that is liquidy red. And that is only one fragment of what the cult regularly did. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok",

I didn\u0027t have a choice; the cult didn\u0027t allow me to. Being naked automatically put us victims in a power imbalance where the abusers wore cloaks or clothes and we, being naked, were objectified, were seen only as tools that they could use for their own pleasure for the SA or the torture, but also to allow them easier and faster access and to see what they were doing for the torture. \n\nThe only time I remember them allowing us to wear clothes was for the trafficking when the people who rented us, mostly men but some women, chose the costumes that would titillate them or please them the most. And when the cult would take us to private businesses or homes we wore regular clothes out in the world. \n\nSo it is a taking back of power now to choose the kind of clothes that make us feel the best and the strongest. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #trafficking #traumatok",

But talking about our trauma can be healing, It does not make anyone sick or hurt or kill them, get a man increase their empathy, and it can also help them in the future with other survivors.

Cult deliberately tries to divide us survivors, to make us mistrust or even hate each other in the cult torture, by forcing us to torture each other or sexually assault each other, by blaming one of us for the torture of each other or even the murder of another survivor. They do this in the torture and the mind control. They also try to encourage that mistrust of each other in everyday time because when we talk with each other it can be incredibly powerful and healing and validating, and we can understand each other on a level that other people can\u0027t. We can help each other know that we\u0027re not crazy the way it cult says we are, that we didn\u0027t hallucinate anything, that it happened. We can put together pieces faster and heal faster with each other. And I find it strange that in psychiatry they don\u0027t want people who are plural or DID talking with each other when the same thing can happen, we can help each other heal better and faster and we can understand each other on a deep level. And so many of us with DID are cult torture survivors. I wish that they would encourage instead of dissuade us to talk to each other because we can find so much healing that way, especially when we find other survivors that are on the same level that we are. There are online groups in newsletters for cult torture survivors and folks living with DID, and there\u0027s also many of us on social media where even if we don\u0027t personally interact we can learn from each other. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok #systokdid #plural",

There are so many of them that it can feel overwhelming and we can\u0027t avoid all the triggers. But if we can talk through the triggers with someone who is compassionate and caring, if we can remind ourselves that this is the present not the past, I think that can help a lot, and we can reclaim some of the triggers or things used in cues.

      "description": "TW: cult torture. As a cult torture survivor it is really hard for me to say no and to set boundaries because I was never allowed to and I was taught the opposite. The cult thought that they owned my body and everything about me for the trafficking and for their own SA and torture of me, and every aspect of my life was controlled. And when I did resist to try and protect other kids they tortured those kids more, or killed some, and tortured me more, and those were heavy teachings to not say no. And then they taught me through specific mind control messages which are negative messages paired by torture that I didn\u0027t have a choice and I always had to submit, and they continuously put me in the victim position after they saw that I would not become like them. They controlled my life in so many extreme ways with so much torture so it can be hard for me to say no or set boundaries if I don\u0027t feel safe. But I have been learning to more and more and I recently did with someone twice where I set a boundary and then they pushed through it again and I setit again - and I feel proud of myself that I did that. it is much easier to set boundaries or say no or ask for what I need when I feel safe with someone, but I am learning to do it more. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok",

There are so many things that are in Halloween costumes and decorations out in the world that are actually used in cult torture and that can bring us back down to the memories and trauma, incmuding skulls, cut off body parts, spiders, black cloaks, masks, and more. It is a really rough time of year for me and for many other cult torture survivors. (Some detail in video).

      "description": "TW: cult torture, trafficking, detail. I was trafficked most of my life by the cult - as a child, as a teen, and even as an adult because I was still being tortured by them. As a child they used stories to entice mostly white het cis men to rent me, like that I was a virgin even though I have been SAed since I was a baby, but many men liked that story. I knew I was queer when I was about five or six; I just didn\u0027t have the language, but as a tween I could say I was lesbian and then the cult used that as a story to entice men to rent me, saying that they could turn me straight by SAing me. All of that created such psychological damage and some physical as well. It impacted my body image, my sense of self, my sense of safety, and more. And when I am really aware of the memories or triggered into it I can think about how men who rented me  might pass me in the street and they know what my body looks like and what they did to me, and I can feel ashamed even though the shame is not mine to hold. I wish we had such better supports in our society for survivors, and better interventions and more trauma-informed training. I am so grateful to be safe now and I wish safety and healing for all of us survivors. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #trafficking #traumatok",

My parents\u0027 friends were cult. And if they weren\u0027t cult then they were someone I was trafficked to. I also thought this because the cult told me that they were everywhere, all powerful, all hearing and all seeing and they made me believe this through different abuse scenarios. But I did have a gut sense that a few people might actually be kind, and I also gained hope through books and movies.

In between the two good therapists I have had, I had to educate every therapist and it can take up most of the session and feel exhausting and not like therapy. It can be hard to find a good therapist and I know I\u0027ll be in that position again. And also it can be a struggle to afford one, especially for those of us with extreme trauma like cult torture and the resulting DID. I\u0027m so grateful for my naturopath and the naturopath students who have been open to me educating them about cult torture and DID and they are kind and compassionate with me and can hear me and believe me, and it is still not therapy, though it is support. I wish there was so much more knowledge about this out in the world that is survivor and DID experience based. I think of my videos and how I educate, and my articles and some things that I put in my books, and I hope it will reach therapists and survivors who need it and also help the general public more. #cultsurvivor #ramcoasurvivor #mentalhealth",

I was taught to mask by my abusers, by the cult, because they wanted me to look more socially presentable and as if everything is more okay, and if you see someone with DID you know that there is trauma there, and you know if they\u0027re switching in and out that there had to be some kind of trauma. I also had a cult-involved partner who did not like the child parts of me fronting so easily and so also increased the torture around that to make us not switch so visibly. \n\nI also have experienced a lot of bullying in my life and the more I was myself and unmasked the more bullying I would get, both with the dissociative identity and the autism. I have been lucky to have had good therapist who I can completely unmask with and some good friends where I can completely unmask with and then some people in my life where I don\u0027t unmask as much but I can still unmask, I can still switch some in and out of folks inside, and also fidget or self soothe by rocking when I need to - I do constant fidgeting even when trying to mask - and I\u0027m really grateful for that because it is exhausting to mask.\n\nBut I feel like for me as an author working with my books and with publishers that they need to know that they can depend on me and that I am reliable and that they can work with me and that I\u0027m not a problem, and so then I feel like I have to mask, and I have to show that like I am one instead of all the many fragments of myself, even though I\u0027ve written a book about it about Dissociative Identity and cult torture (not yet published; it\u0027s out with editors) to have them feel more comfortable. I wish that the world was different, that we had more acceptance and compassion automatically for however we present and how we are in the world, and how we need to be; it would be so much less exhausting.\n\nSo I am most me when I am around people I feel safe with, layers of safety, and it is so much less exhausting and I am really grateful for it.\n\nBut to do these videos I am often me, Cheryl, and author folks inside me, and sometimes wise parts inside me, or mothering or parenting parts inside me to draw on certain wisdom. Then when I am talking about details about cult torture or DID I am drawing on parts of me who are knowledge-based parts who sit way up in my head who aren\u0027t as much in the body but who are very knowledge-based and can speak from that experience and speak from that information. I\u0027m blending folks inside together intentionally, or sometimes not intentionally, to present in a way that feels like people can hear me. But I wish I felt free to be all of me all the time because it would be so much less exhausting as long as we had compassion and empathy from other people; it could be so healing. And so those spaces where I actually have that with people feels freeing and healing and wonderful and I\u0027m really grateful for them. #dissociativeidentitydisorder #systok #cultsurvivor #ramcoa",

The cult frequently used confinement in conjunction with threats of death or that we were already dead to make this both physical and psychological torture such as drugging us up so we were paralyzed, putting us in a coffin and bearing us underground where there was very little air and we could not move. (More examples in video.) Cults do this to threaten and subdue victims because it is a form of isolation, a form of power and control and showing the victim that they have total control over the victims life or death, and a way to encourage splitting with the dissociative identity. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok",

It took me most of my life, even though I disclosed child sexual abuse at age 13 with a great uncle, I couldn\u0027t tell the authorities that my parents were torturing me and other people because I was living with my abusers and they killed kids in front of me and threatened to kill me and I knew they could and would. And then there\u0027s all the dissociation and the stuffing down of memories, and all the mind control messages put in there through torture to not remember and to not tell. When I remembered them and what they were doing to me I ran away from home, but they found me and brought me back over and over and over and would torture me at night. I wish that I\u0027d had more support and people who were trauma informed and cult informed who could help, but it can be hard to even have people hear us and believe us. I had to work so hard on inner communication and inner cooperation, to have everyone inside tell me who they remembered were our abusers, cut off contact , and work on the mind control messages. So I am grateful for every one of you who here and believe me and other survivors and then are more aware for other survivors you might come across. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok",

      "description": "TW: cult torture, detail. The cult frequently used needles for both physical and psychological torture. They used different sizes and thicknesses of needles, most did not have handles, a few did; the ones that did were used to twist to create more pain. The cult was very good at creating the most pain with the least physical visible effect, using different angles and knowing where to put the needles. There were regular men and some women who paid a huge extra fee in the trafficking to be taught torture techniques, and one of the torture techniques was using needles. Some of those people were very clumsy with the needles even though the cult first demonstrated on me then on another kid while the person who paid tried to torture me in the exact same way. Because they were clumsy it was bad in a different way where there was a lot more bleeding, and swelling that the cult had to bring down with ice. The cult is so practiced and deliberate that they don\u0027t leave effects like that. The cult also used psychological torture paired with the physical torture for doing things such as temporarily paralyzing my limbs using needles, telling me that they would kill the child in front of me if I didn\u0027t take the dagger away, and because I could not move or lift my arms I lunged forward and tried to grab it with my mouth but I could not pull the dagger from him and so he killed the child. That is psychological torture paired with physical torture. Cult always tries to create the most horrific combination of physical and psychological torture that they can. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok",

Survivors speaking out is a huge act of courage, even if it is just to one other person, and can make room for more survivors to be heard and believed, too.

      "description": "TW: cult torture. It\u0027s raining this morning and it feels like all the tears I can\u0027t cry, all the tears that I was taught not to cry by the torture, by the cult, and it gives me a feeling of lightness in my chest, of ease of some of the grief that I hold for so many things that the cult did, but also for the murder of Judy, and for all the other kids.\n\nSince I talked publicly about Judy I have been having so many more memories of her, and in every single memory we fought to protect each other, we fought against the cult even though we both got tortured more, we fought to protect each other. We tried to tell each other in so many ways that we were sorry for what the cult was forcing us to do, that the cult forced us to do to each other and the sexual assaults for the child p0rn0gr\u00E0phy, and even the murder at the end where the cult forced my six-year-old fingers over the handle of the knife to her neck.\n\nAnd even then I could see that she knew it was the cult\u0027s fault, that they were the ones to blame. Even then I could see her love for me and how we both knew the cult was the one to blame.\n \nBut for so many years I have held so much guilt in me, in my body, in my emotions, because they told me it was my fault because it was my hand on the handle even though I was 6 years old, and I fought them, but they were adults, adult males, some women. They overpowered me, they overpowered Judy, neither of us could stop it. It wasn\u0027t my fault. I can see that in my mind now and through lots of therapy too, it wasn\u0027t my fault, it wasn\u0027t Judy\u0027s fault either for any of what the cult forced us to do to each other, but her murder was not my fault.\n\n With the memories over \u0026 over \u0026 over, the connection we had, the soul bond we had, I feel closer to her \u0026 I feel the grief more.  \n\n I think of how the cult intentionally tried to increase the bond between us, \u0026 likely partnered us with each other, because we were so similar in how we were the only ones who looked at each other\u0027s eyes \u0026 would whisper apologies \u0026 in our touches \u0026 looking at each other with empathy \u0026 pain as the cult forced us to do what we did to each other. \n\nShe was the only other kid who did that with me \u0026 for me who made me feel seen \u0026 loved even in all the evil \u0026 the torture that was happening. I think the cult intentionally paired us so that it would be even more trauma when they murdered her, so it would break me \u0026 split me more \u0026 more \u0026 more. Because the cult wanted me to become like them; they wanted me to harden my heart. Judy was unregistered, born into the cult, \u0026 so they saw her life as worthless, except for torture, child p0rn0gr\u00E0phy, \u0026 the trafficking, \u0026 what they could do to both of us in the end.\n\nBut she had so much value. She was my friend, \u0026 she was a good soul, a good person. I loved her \u0026 I am grateful for her. I think we helped each other feel seen \u0026 loved when there was no one else doing that, when it was only torture \u0026 evil around us. I\u0027m so grateful for her.\n\nThe more I can talk about her the more I can release some of the guilt \u0026 the pain. It is still there. It was the cult\u0027s fault; I know that \u0026 I can see that so clearly for every other survivor who\u0027s been through the same thing, but the cult taught us it was our fault in everything they said \u0026 did. I think I am releasing it more now \u0026 I\u0027m grateful to.\n\nI love her \u0026 will never forget her,  \u0026 in my saying her name, Judy, other people will not forget her either, \u0026 the friendship she gave me \u0026 the ways we tried to protect each other \u0026 apologize to each other for something that was not our fault, \u0026 that matters.\n\n I hope if you\u0027ve been through the same or similar things you know it was not your fault either; it was the fault of the cult, the abusers, the tormentors. When we are children we have no power, no control \u0026 we are blameless \u0026 we are innocent \u0026 we are good. #cultsurvivor #ramcoasurvivor #traumatok",

There are so many ways and reasons and they are multi-layered including that the cult uses sophisticated mind control paired with torture to keep us silent; cults forcibly birth most of the babies and kids that they murder through cult members who have a uteruses; cult members look and sound respectable and go to church and have upstanding jobs; there are cult members who were police, lawyers, doctors, nurses, teachers etc.; and people are not very observant of trauma and often do not know the signs and do not put them together; and most physical signs are hidden internally or beneath clothes where no one would look, and the psychological signs even though they can be so obvious people aren\u0027t aware or they are excused away. And then we live in a society that doesn\u0027t even believe folks who speak out about SA. I hope as I speak out and more survivors do that more and more survivors are believed and heard and that awareness is raised and more survivors can get saved sooner. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok",

      "description": "TW: mind control from cult torture. when I have mind control happening from the Colts torture the first thing that helps is to recognize that it\u0027s happening, so recognize the repeated messages, sometimes in my abusers\u0027 voices, to hurt her kill myself, or seeing flashes of myself doing that like close ups which parts of me were taught to do by practicing. Then it helps to directly counteract those messages, remind everyone inside that the cult is cruel and diabolical and evil; everything they taught us is to only benefit them and hurt us and so we want the opposite of them, we want safety and compassion and healing and love. It helps to talk to others inside, to write out opposite messages. It can help to think of and visualize the people we love who we would never ever want to hurt and that can be an extra wall or a last wall. And it can also really help to ask someone safe who we care about to give us counter messages; their compassion and love can cut through the mind control and hate. I also have asked folks inside to counter the messages and alert me when it\u0027s happening. and I\u0027ve also used grounding and calming techniques, and staying in the present, helping folk inside see that this is the present not the past. And reminding folks inside that we don\u0027t want to die, we just want things to be happier and easier and find more love and compassion and good. These things help me and I hope they\u0027ll help you, too. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #mindcontrol #traumahealing",

      "description": "TW: cult torture, mind control, su1c1dal ideation. I had a rough mental health day yesterday after I told my naturopath and naturopath student a new-to-me, very painful torture memory. Doing that triggered off old mind control messages to unalive myself (which I will never do), combined with really intense, overwhelming despair, depression, grief. Usually I can recognize mind control going on but I was stuffing it down and having a hard time thinking through it. I used so many coping techniques including tapping, nervous system regulation techniques, homeopathic remedies, grounding, comforting, and it would shift it for a little while and then it would come back just as hard or harder. It took me most of the day to understand why that mind control got triggered - that I told a really painful new trauma memory. Then when I talked to my friend who is also a cult survivor she reminded me it wasn\u0027t just the specific trauma memory I told that is so raw and deep and more full than my memories usually are, it was also that I told a helping professional. I have so much mind control against doing that, and I remember very specific things the cult did to keep me from talking especially to any helping professionals. Once I connected it up it helped shift and move it a lot faster. It\u0027s still there some today but it\u0027s not as bad at all. We *can* move through mind control and old cult messages taught through torture. It helps to have inner communication, inner cooperation, awareness that mind control has been set off, and some support. More detail in my video. #cultsurvivor #mindcontrol #ramcoa",

      "description": "TW: cult torture, mind control. There are times of year when it feels so hard to get through and I don\u0027t know how I will, when the grief and sadness and despair and depression are so strong. I think when that happens I am reliving what I felt during the cult torture, as well as responding to old mind control messages to unalive myself that the cult deliberately gave to specific parts of me (DID). \nThere are many ways to help that. One is doing rescue work where I ask folks inside to take me back to when they felt that way, relive the memory with them, then send the abusers away in my memory, comfort the folks inside who were traumatized, give them new messages and ask if they want new jobs, or slowly change how they are in the world or with me. But I can only do that when I\u0027m feeling safe enough. Another way is to write out the old mind control messages or trauma or draw it out. Another is to talk to my therapist or a friend or support who can hear me with compassion and empathy. I also now use nervous system regulation techniques which can help my body feel safe and then folks inside feel safe and remind us that we\u0027re not being abused anymore, that we are safe, that we have choices now and can choose to find comfort. Comfort is also another big thing, it can help. I end up having chocolate, hugging squishmallows, hugging a person if I feel safe with them, reading a good book. I think if we\u0027re only doing one or very few of those things it makes it harder to get through. like when I was only processing memory all the time I was flooding. I needed to know the information but not in that way; it was overwhelming. But if I only do positive distraction or reassurance the trauma and all the emotion is still sitting there in me and it\u0027s not getting out, but a combination of those things helps. I hope these things might help you, too, and that you have support when you need it. #cultsurvivor #didsystem #mindcontrol #ramcoasurvivor #traumahealing",

      "description": "TW: cult torture survivor, Mother\u0027s Day. I have been dissociating so hard about Mother\u0027s Day because it is such a hard time of year for me; it is used in the  cult torture. Usually I am so dissociated from it that I can\u0027t stay aware of it until maybe the day but I still have a rough time leading up to it and on the day, so this year I am trying to stay more aware of it which is hard. But it was hard even without staying aware; I still had a rough time because of the time of year, and I think it\u0027s healthier to stay aware. Mother\u0027s Day is hard because of cults use it, increasing the torture, r@pe, and mind control and doing specific things. But it\u0027s also always been hard because I had an abusive mother who sexually abused me, physically abused me, psychologically abused me, and of course tortured me. And now this year I have the added awareness of the grief of my mother parts who were forcibly impregnated and forced to bear children in the cult torture and that is an added layer of deep grief. So I am trying to do things to self-soothe, maybe some art, definitely some treats, reading a good book or watching a good show, talking to a good friend about the trauma and to my therapist. I know that Mother\u0027s Day is hard for so many people for so many reasons. I hope if it\u0027s rough for you too that you also do some things that help you and don\u0027t hurt you, or soothing are comforting, that you get some support, and that it is not as hard as it has been before.

This is the first time I stayed fully aware of them instead of dissociating the way I used to, and I had near constant body memories, old programming messages to hurt myself or unalive myself which I will never do, flashes of memory of the ways they reenacted some of the religious aspects and used them, and other memories, and it was a struggle. But it was also easier because I talked a lot of the day with a cult curvivor friend and that helped a lot and I used a lot of positive distraction as well but stayed aware. But it was rough. I felt relief this morning before some depression and grief came at me but it was not as bad as the last few days; I am so glad it\u0027s over. I hope that you also had some support or used some good coping to get through if you\u0027re also a cult torture survivor or you found the weekend hard. #cultsurvivor #traumatok #traumahealing",

      "description": "TW: cult torture survivor. My neighbour was talking to me about the importance of forgiving even though she knows I\u0027m a cult torture survivor. I don\u0027t believe that we need to forgive our abusers to heal. I believe that we need to forgive ourselves for things that we feel responsible for even though they weren\u0027t our responsibility, like for me not being able to save other victims while I was being tortured. But I don\u0027t believe that we need to forgive our abusers. They chose to abuse and torture and rape and murder. And I have seen great healing in myself over the years without forgiving them. I think forgiveness is like accepting what they did or saying it\u0027s okay. If you personally feel like you need to forgive your abusers that is your choice but I think it\u0027s important not to push one\u0027s belief on anyone else. We each heal in our own way. #cultsurvivor #traumahealing #mentalhealth",

I was talking with another cult survivor who reminded me Easter is coming up. Easter is one of the times that cult increases very specific torture and mind control messages about unaliving ourselves if we\u0027re not still being tortured. For me it helps to realize that, to make that connection, and to specifically counter those messages. I would never unalive myself; I have lots of safeguards against it and I know it\u0027s old cult messages. I also think it helps to talk with other survivors or a therapist or with someone who can remind you that you have a hard time every year at certain times of year, and it is from the trauma and mind control and you\u0027re going to get through it. #cultsurvivor #traumatok #mindcontrol  #ramcoa #didsystem",

I was talking with my naturopath the other day about how I felt so guilty that I couldn\u0027t protect others in the cult torture even though I tried so hard. I couldn\u0027t even protect myself. She reminded me that I was one person facing a group of organized people with weapons who killed and tortured and raped, and how could I have protected others and myself? It\u0027s something that my therapist has told me before and reminded me of. It\u0027s something I know intellectually but I forget when I have new memories come forward and I am reliving them or I have parts of me who went through those memories come forward more in my body to tell me about them. I think it helps to remember how vulnerable we were, how organized the torture and my control and abuse was, and how even if we fought or even if we had parts of ourselves that felt like they were strong it wasn\u0027t their fault or our fault that we couldn\u0027t protect ourselves or others.

A few days ago I was having body memories of very specific torture that was done to me by the cult (more details in the video), but I was having trouble figuring out if it was body memory or not, because I used to assume that everything I felt in my body that didn\u0027t feel right was body memory because I was having trauma memories all the time, like nausea. But then I found out that some of the problems were physical (gluten intolerance, gall bladder, etc.) and so then I started assuming that everything was physical. But I think some is body memory and some is physical. I talked it through with a survivor friend and I think for me if it goes on for days and days and is a constant or is super intense or always happens around the same time like every night it\u0027s probably something to check out with a doctor. But if it comes and goes then it is likely body memory, especially if it is in specific areas where the torture was done and feels like the torture or responss I had to it. I may not have it right but it feels right for me for now. And I think it\u0027s always a good idea to check with a doctor. #cultsurvivor #traumatok #ramcoasurvivor #traumahealing",

      "description": "TW: cult torture survivor. \nWhen I was a child being tortured by my cult abusers, including my parents, I couldn\u0027t understand how they could enjoy and get off on my pain and my terror and that of the other kids. I still don\u0027t understand it. They were trying to make me like them, they were trying to mold me into their image and make me lack compassion and empathy and make me enjoy others\u0027 pain and they couldn\u0027t do it.\n\n I remember being about five maybe six, on an altar being r@ped and looking up at my r@pist, my abuser who was enjoying my pain and terror, who was getting off on it so much, and the cries of other kids being r@ped and tortured and abused, and thinking \u0022I will never be like you, I choose to be the opposite of you.\u0022 They tortured me more, they increased the mind control more, they forced me to do horrific things, but they couldn\u0027t make me like them, they couldn\u0027t take away my good soul. \n\nI kept splitting off parts of myself, some to do what they were forcing me to do so I wouldn\u0027t lose my innocence and my sanity, so that I could survive and live, but I also created parts of me to heal and work on healing, to try and get safe. \n\nThere were parts of me who would try and protect the other kids and even adults, protect them or help them in the ways that I could, and the cult could not stamp that out. Eventually they realized that and instead of trying to force me to be an abuser they kept putting me in the role of victim every time. But that didn\u0027t change it for me, my desire to get safe, my desire to heal, my desire to help others; they couldn\u0027t stamp that out. \n\nThey tried with everything in them; that included deliberate mind control and torture and skewed abuse scenarios, and they still couldn\u0027t do that, they still couldn\u0027t make me like them. That was true for me and for many other kids, though there were also many kids who did become like them and took their place or stood alongside them to enjoy torturing and murdering and r@ping other people. \n\nBut just because we\u0027ve been tortured or abused and deliberately put on the path of becoming like our abusers doesn\u0027t mean we become like them. We can fight back in all the ways we can, we can work on healing and getting safe, and then when we\u0027re safe we have even more choice and more ways to put good in the world and to protect ourselves and others. I hope you know that and you see that in yourself too. #cultsurvivor #traumatok #didsystem #dissociativeidentity #ramcoa",

      "description": "TW: cult torture survivor. Today is Dissociative Identity Disorder Awareness Day or DID Awareness Day. DID is much more common than many people think, and you may know someone in your life who lives with it. I\u0027m Cheryl Rainfield, author of SCARS, STAINED, HUNTED, VISIONS, and I live with polyfragmented DID as a direct result of the cult torture that I survived as a child, as a teen, as an adult. The parts of me were created as a child and a teen, but some even in later years as the torture continued. DID is not crazy; it is a creative, intelligent way of coping with extreme, ongoing childhood torture and abuse and mind control, a way to escape when we couldn\u0027t physically escape, when there was no other way to escape except for splitting off parts in the mind. And that\u0027s a huge part of how I survived and how I kept my sanity and how I kept my good soul intact.\n\nFor me it\u0027s been really important to work on inner cooperation and inner communication, and working with other parts inside of me, making sure that I and all parts of me are aware that it\u0027s the present and what\u0027s going on in the outside world. So I don\u0027t lose time anymore, but I worked for a long time to do that, and to work with everyone inside. It also helps me to do rescue work with parts of me, to listen to when they were created and how they were created, like the abuse or torture event, and then to go back and visualize saving them from that and helping them learn a new job if the job or the role that they have is not healthy one. \n\nBecause I am a cult torture survivor, not all the parts of me were created by me; there are some parts of me that cult intentionally to have very specific jobs and roles that they wanted, like having parts of me who would deny the memories, the abuse and trauma, who would make me doubt it, would keep me from remembering or keep me from talking, or who would hurt me emotionally or physically. Those are very specific jobs that the cult created in me and wanted, and it is common for cult torture survivors who have DID to have some of those jobs or roles inside. It helps so much to work with those parts of us, and to see that they\u0027re not scary; they were created because they had to or the cult would have continued and increased the torture and mind control, so it was survival. So their root or their true role underneath it all Is to protect us and help us survive and get through. So when you know that it helps; it helps make it so much easier to work with them even though they can put up a tough facade.\n\n I hope that if you know someone who has DID that you will listen to their experience, because everyone\u0027s experience can be a little or a lot different, and also read a book about it, or watch some videos, or read some articles. It helps to have people who could hear in a real way. #didawareness #dissociativeidentitydisorder #cultsurvivor #multiplepersonalities #ramcoasurvivor",

      "description": "TW: satanic cult torture survivor.  The people that are saying that cult abuse is not real, that satanic cult abuse is not real, that it\u0027s all \u0022satanic panic\u0022 and conspiracy theories, and where\u0027s the evidence, are using the same language that our cult abusers used, and that abusers use, and that\u0027s not a side that I would want to be on. I\u0027m Cheryl Rainfield, author of SCARS, STAINED, HUNTED, VISIONS, and I am a satanic cult torture survivor as well as a survivor of the KKK and Nazi Cults and some other smaller ones. My parents were part of intergenerational, interconnected cults, and so were my entire extended family and many of their friends. I am lucky to be alive and I am grateful to be alive.  \n\nSo some people ask where is the proof? First of all I think you should believe survivors when we speak out; it is horrific and painful and hard to talk about and we are some of the most silenced survivors in society. People so often don\u0027t want to believe even rape; they have trouble believing cult torture. Many of us survivors have internal scarring, where it wouldn\u0027t show, where most people wouldn\u0027t see, but my doctor found it. I had gouges in my teeth from when my father and other abusers used dental tools on me for torture, which my dentist found, which I have now ground down because of how many years I\u0027ve been grinding my teeth. \n\nThere is the truth in our words, and our memories, and our trauma. I would not have DID, dissociative identity disorder, without haven\u0027t had to split off parts of myself to survive the torture and the mind control, and having my cult abusers specifically, deliberately create splits and parts of me to take on jobs that they wanted those parts of me to take on, like finding ways to hurt myself emotionally and shut myself up and keep myself quiet. Those are very standard jobs cult abusers give us. I would not have the c-ptsd, the trauma, the triggers that plague me almost every day, the triggers down to trauma memories, the debilitating way that trauma memories can take me over and the effects of trauma, so many effects of trauma everyday and every night of my life. I have shown so many signs of abuse and extreme abuse and torture my entire life, and teachers and other people were usually concerned but didn\u0027t understand what they were seeing and didn\u0027t recognize it. \n\nWhen we tell you that we have been through torture we mean actual torture - physical torture, sexual torture, psychological torture. Satanic cult abuse is real, and there are so many survivors. Cult abuse is real and there are so many survivors. I call it cult torture because it was torture. We are here and I hope that you believe us and I hope that you don\u0027t fall into the trap that abusers want you to and use the phrases \u0022satanic panic\u0022 or \u0022conspiracy theories\u0022 to talk about satanic cult torture survivors.

      "description": "TW: satanic cult torture survivor.\nThere is a creator on tiktok, a fellow author, who is trying to discredit satanic cult survivors, saying that it is all \u0022satanic panic\u0022 and conspiracy theories, and that there was no evidence.\n\nYou may know me, I am Cheryl Rainfield, author of SCARS, STAINED, HUNTED, VISIONS, and I have been open since I was a teen about being a cult torture survivor. My parents and extended family were part of intergenerational, interconnected cults, and that included satanic, KKK, and Neo Nazi and some other smaller cults. This was incredibly organized and intentional. It was torture and mind control and trafficking. It was horrific and I\u0027m really grateful to be alive.\n\nI believe other survivors. I think it is so important to believe and hear other survivors. I think it\u0027s important to lift up voices of survivors. I know how hard it can be for people to hear and believe, to want to believe in our \u0022civilized\u0022 society that these horrific things happen. I think about how hard it is for so many people to believe a woman who\u0027s been raped, how many people try and tear her apart and say that she\u0027s lying, child sexual abuse survivors. Then you go to the extreme organized cult torture that happens in our society - people don\u0027t want to listen or believe, but it\u0027s real and it happens. There is proof.\n\nBut organized cults like this make it very hard persona virus to be believed and to see evidence but there is evidence. Go to website ra-info.org and also traumadissociation.com, and you will find links to and discussion about cases where they have found evidence of satanic cult abuse such as the McMartin case where they found tunnels and bones and cauldrons exactly where the kids of the daycare said they would be. That is eerily reminiscent of the tunnels that have been found under some Hollywood homes and extreme abuse that is very close to or is cult torture that is coming out about P Diddy and associates.\n\nI\u0027m going to talk about some detail about cult torture; it may be hard to hear and so if you don\u0027t want to hear please scroll away. One thing that cults do to try and destroy evidence and make sure that kids and teens and adults survivors when they speak out are not believed, is that they force us victims to ingest the flesh of people who were murdered, to get rid of a lot of evidence (and traumatize us more). It is done in many different ways including grinding up the bones.\n\nAnother thing that makes it harder for people to find evidence  is that in organized cult torture like I survived with satanic, KKK, and Nazi every person who is born assigned female at birth  or with a uterus is forced to bear a  child or children, usually multiple children, for the cult. The babies are usually born early, they are not registered in hospitals, they\u0027re not born in hospitals, they are born in cult settings and they are grown up to the age they are allowed to live. They are kept in cult settings only where they don\u0027t go to school, they don\u0027t have access to other things and then those kids are killed. That is a huge part of the murder that happens, the torture.\n\nThere are also a lot of people in positions of power; I remember police officers, social workers, judges, lawyers, doctors, and nurses, and they all worked in conjunction with each other so that there was as little possible evidence to be found, except of course in our bodies, and to help keep us silent. \n\nOrganized cults build on years and years of torture and mind control techniques to keep us silent, and so speaking out is so incredibly hard. I  hope that you can believe and hear survivors, and hold space for us even though it is so much pain and trauma. I think it\u0027s so important that we believe survivors, support survivors, and that we don\u0027t try and tear other survivors down.\n\n I\u0027m also very aware that in the organized cult torture, the satanic, KKK, and Nazi, that our abusers did sometimes dress up as police and doctors and nurses and teachers to try and make us be afraid of those people in positions of power and to keep us from talking. It was very intentional. But there were also cult members who had those professions in society.\n\nI don\u0027t believe that my cult abusers  actually believed in Satanism; I think they used the language and the clothing that they wore, and the religious artifacts, to try and discredit us more when we would actually talk because who wants to believe that? And to create more fear. And for Satanism they used Christianity in an upside down way and they used many of the same religious holidays and that makes it even more triggering for a cult torture survivors because there is a constant bombardment of language that is used in cult torture that is in our society and built into our society and our holidays.\n\n I hope you believe and listen to and support survivors and that you don\u0027t use phrases like satanic panic or conspiracy theories.\n\nThank you for hearing me. #cultsurvivor #ramcoasurvivor #believesurvivors",
