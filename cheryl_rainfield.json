It\u0027s September and I am already having a hard time around Halloween because in cult.torture they increase the torture and mind control starting from September all the way up to Halloween. There are so many things that are in Halloween costumes and decorations out in the world that are actually used in cult torture and that can bring us back down to the memories and trauma, incmuding skulls, cut off body parts, spiders, black cloaks, masks, and more. It is a really rough time of year for me and for many other cult torture survivors. (Some detail in video). So if you know a cult torture survivor you might want to check in with them or offer to hear them if they want to talk or just be gentle with them. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok",

      "description": "TW: cult torture, trafficking, detail. I was trafficked most of my life by the cult - as a child, as a teen, and even as an adult because I was still being tortured by them. As a child they used stories to entice mostly white het cis men to rent me, like that I was a virgin even though I have been SAed since I was a baby, but many men liked that story. I knew I was queer when I was about five or six; I just didn\u0027t have the language, but as a tween I could say I was lesbian and then the cult used that as a story to entice men to rent me, saying that they could turn me straight by SAing me. All of that created such psychological damage and some physical as well. It impacted my body image, my sense of self, my sense of safety, and more. And when I am really aware of the memories or triggered into it I can think about how men who rented me  might pass me in the street and they know what my body looks like and what they did to me, and I can feel ashamed even though the shame is not mine to hold. I wish we had such better supports in our society for survivors, and better interventions and more trauma-informed training. I am so grateful to be safe now and I wish safety and healing for all of us survivors. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #trafficking #traumatok",

There were a lot of cult members who lived on the street I grew up in, so many of them in the church, there was at least one cult member at every school that I went to who would report back on me, and in the very few extracurricular activities my parents allowed me to go to there was always a cult member. My parents\u0027 friends were cult. And if they weren\u0027t cult then they were someone I was trafficked to. I also thought this because the cult told me that they were everywhere, all powerful, all hearing and all seeing and they made me believe this through different abuse scenarios. But I did have a gut sense that a few people might actually be kind, and I also gained hope through books and movies. I\u0027m glad I held on to that hope that they were safe people in the world and that I found some over time, that there are kind and compassionate people in the world. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok",

In between the two good therapists I have had, I had to educate every therapist and it can take up most of the session and feel exhausting and not like therapy. It can be hard to find a good therapist and I know I\u0027ll be in that position again. And also it can be a struggle to afford one, especially for those of us with extreme trauma like cult torture and the resulting DID. I\u0027m so grateful for my naturopath and the naturopath students who have been open to me educating them about cult torture and DID and they are kind and compassionate with me and can hear me and believe me, and it is still not therapy, though it is support. I wish there was so much more knowledge about this out in the world that is survivor and DID experience based.

I was taught to mask by my abusers, by the cult, because they wanted me to look more socially presentable and as if everything is more okay, and if you see someone with DID you know that there is trauma there, and you know if they\u0027re switching in and out that there had to be some kind of trauma. I also had a cult-involved partner who did not like the child parts of me fronting so easily and so also increased the torture around that to make us not switch so visibly. \n\nI also have experienced a lot of bullying in my life and the more I was myself and unmasked the more bullying I would get, both with the dissociative identity and the autism. I have been lucky to have had good therapist who I can completely unmask with and some good friends where I can completely unmask with and then some people in my life where I don\u0027t unmask as much but I can still unmask, I can still switch some in and out of folks inside, and also fidget or self soothe by rocking when I need to - I do constant fidgeting even when trying to mask - and I\u0027m really grateful for that because it is exhausting to mask.\n\nBut I feel like for me as an author working with my books and with publishers that they need to know that they can depend on me and that I am reliable and that they can work with me and that I\u0027m not a problem, and so then I feel like I have to mask, and I have to show that like I am one instead of all the many fragments of myself, even though I\u0027ve written a book about it about Dissociative Identity and cult torture (not yet published; it\u0027s out with editors) to have them feel more comfortable. I wish that the world was different, that we had more acceptance and compassion automatically for however we present and how we are in the world, and how we need to be; it would be so much less exhausting.\n\nSo I am most me when I am around people I feel safe with, layers of safety, and it is so much less exhausting and I am really grateful for it.\n\nBut to do these videos I am often me, Cheryl, and author folks inside me, and sometimes wise parts inside me, or mothering or parenting parts inside me to draw on certain wisdom. Then when I am talking about details about cult torture or DID I am drawing on parts of me who are knowledge-based parts who sit way up in my head who aren\u0027t as much in the body but who are very knowledge-based and can speak from that experience and speak from that information. I\u0027m blending folks inside together intentionally, or sometimes not intentionally, to present in a way that feels like people can hear me. But I wish I felt free to be all of me all the time because it would be so much less exhausting as long as we had compassion and empathy from other people; it could be so healing. And so those spaces where I actually have that with people feels freeing and healing and wonderful and I\u0027m really grateful for them. #dissociativeidentitydisorder #systok #cultsurvivor #ramcoa",

It took me most of my life, even though I disclosed child sexual abuse at age 13 with a great uncle, I couldn\u0027t tell the authorities that my parents were torturing me and other people because I was living with my abusers and they killed kids in front of me and threatened to kill me and I knew they could and would. And then there\u0027s all the dissociation and the stuffing down of memories, and all the mind control messages put in there through torture to not remember and to not tell. When I remembered them and what they were doing to me I ran away from home, but they found me and brought me back over and over and over and would torture me at night. I wish that I\u0027d had more support and people who were trauma informed and cult informed who could help, but it can be hard to even have people hear us and believe us. I had to work so hard on inner communication and inner cooperation, to have everyone inside tell me who they remembered were our abusers, cut off contact , and work on the mind control messages. So I am grateful for every one of you who here and believe me and other survivors and then are more aware for other survivors you might come across. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok",

      "description": "TW: cult torture, detail. The cult frequently used needles for both physical and psychological torture. They used different sizes and thicknesses of needles, most did not have handles, a few did; the ones that did were used to twist to create more pain. The cult was very good at creating the most pain with the least physical visible effect, using different angles and knowing where to put the needles. There were regular men and some women who paid a huge extra fee in the trafficking to be taught torture techniques, and one of the torture techniques was using needles. Some of those people were very clumsy with the needles even though the cult first demonstrated on me then on another kid while the person who paid tried to torture me in the exact same way. Because they were clumsy it was bad in a different way where there was a lot more bleeding, and swelling that the cult had to bring down with ice. The cult is so practiced and deliberate that they don\u0027t leave effects like that. The cult also used psychological torture paired with the physical torture for doing things such as temporarily paralyzing my limbs using needles, telling me that they would kill the child in front of me if I didn\u0027t take the dagger away, and because I could not move or lift my arms I lunged forward and tried to grab it with my mouth but I could not pull the dagger from him and so he killed the child. That is psychological torture paired with physical torture. Cult always tries to create the most horrific combination of physical and psychological torture that they can. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok",

The cult demands silence; it is what allows them to continue, and they reinforce the need for silence in so many different ways, including torture, specific mind control, creation or splitting off of folks inside (dissociative Identity) for specific jobs to keep us silent or keep us from remembering or make us doubt our memories), elaborate abuse scenarios related to talking equals death or pain for us and others, and murder, and more. Survivors speaking out is a huge act of courage, even if it is just to one other person, and can make room for more survivors to be heard and believed, too. And when we are heard with compassion and empathy it helps cut through the mind control. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok",

      "description": "TW: cult torture. It\u0027s raining this morning and it feels like all the tears I can\u0027t cry, all the tears that I was taught not to cry by the torture, by the cult, and it gives me a feeling of lightness in my chest, of ease of some of the grief that I hold for so many things that the cult did, but also for the murder of Judy, and for all the other kids.\n\nSince I talked publicly about Judy I have been having so many more memories of her, and in every single memory we fought to protect each other, we fought against the cult even though we both got tortured more, we fought to protect each other. We tried to tell each other in so many ways that we were sorry for what the cult was forcing us to do, that the cult forced us to do to each other and the sexual assaults for the child p0rn0gr\u00E0phy, and even the murder at the end where the cult forced my six-year-old fingers over the handle of the knife to her neck.\n\nAnd even then I could see that she knew it was the cult\u0027s fault, that they were the ones to blame. Even then I could see her love for me and how we both knew the cult was the one to blame.\n \nBut for so many years I have held so much guilt in me, in my body, in my emotions, because they told me it was my fault because it was my hand on the handle even though I was 6 years old, and I fought them, but they were adults, adult males, some women. They overpowered me, they overpowered Judy, neither of us could stop it. It wasn\u0027t my fault. I can see that in my mind now and through lots of therapy too, it wasn\u0027t my fault, it wasn\u0027t Judy\u0027s fault either for any of what the cult forced us to do to each other, but her murder was not my fault.\n\n With the memories over \u0026 over \u0026 over, the connection we had, the soul bond we had, I feel closer to her \u0026 I feel the grief more.  \n\n I think of how the cult intentionally tried to increase the bond between us, \u0026 likely partnered us with each other, because we were so similar in how we were the only ones who looked at each other\u0027s eyes \u0026 would whisper apologies \u0026 in our touches \u0026 looking at each other with empathy \u0026 pain as the cult forced us to do what we did to each other. \n\nShe was the only other kid who did that with me \u0026 for me who made me feel seen \u0026 loved even in all the evil \u0026 the torture that was happening. I think the cult intentionally paired us so that it would be even more trauma when they murdered her, so it would break me \u0026 split me more \u0026 more \u0026 more. Because the cult wanted me to become like them; they wanted me to harden my heart. Judy was unregistered, born into the cult, \u0026 so they saw her life as worthless, except for torture, child p0rn0gr\u00E0phy, \u0026 the trafficking, \u0026 what they could do to both of us in the end.\n\nBut she had so much value. She was my friend, \u0026 she was a good soul, a good person. I loved her \u0026 I am grateful for her. I think we helped each other feel seen \u0026 loved when there was no one else doing that, when it was only torture \u0026 evil around us. I\u0027m so grateful for her.\n\nThe more I can talk about her the more I can release some of the guilt \u0026 the pain. It is still there. It was the cult\u0027s fault; I know that \u0026 I can see that so clearly for every other survivor who\u0027s been through the same thing, but the cult taught us it was our fault in everything they said \u0026 did. I think I am releasing it more now \u0026 I\u0027m grateful to.\n\nI love her \u0026 will never forget her,  \u0026 in my saying her name, Judy, other people will not forget her either, \u0026 the friendship she gave me \u0026 the ways we tried to protect each other \u0026 apologize to each other for something that was not our fault, \u0026 that matters.\n\n I hope if you\u0027ve been through the same or similar things you know it was not your fault either; it was the fault of the cult, the abusers, the tormentors. When we are children we have no power, no control \u0026 we are blameless \u0026 we are innocent \u0026 we are good. #cultsurvivor #ramcoasurvivor #traumatok",

There are so many examples of it, from trying to make us believe that we are completely responsible for all the torture and SA and murder, to constantly change in the rules on us and making us think that if only we had done the right thing that someone wouldn\u0027t have been murdered or tortured, to pretending to rescue us and tell us that they love us and then turn around and hate us and torture us more, usually by the \u0022other mother\u0022 or \u0022other father,\u0022 and so much more. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok",

There are so many ways and reasons and they are multi-layered including that the cult uses sophisticated mind control paired with torture to keep us silent; cults forcibly birth most of the babies and kids that they murder through cult members who have a uteruses; cult members look and sound respectable and go to church and have upstanding jobs; there are cult members who were police, lawyers, doctors, nurses, teachers etc.; and people are not very observant of trauma and often do not know the signs and do not put them together; and most physical signs are hidden internally or beneath clothes where no one would look, and the psychological signs even though they can be so obvious people aren\u0027t aware or they are excused away. And then we live in a society that doesn\u0027t even believe folks who speak out about SA. I hope as I speak out and more survivors do that more and more survivors are believed and heard and that awareness is raised and more survivors can get saved sooner. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok",

      "description": "TW: mind control from cult torture. when I have mind control happening from the Colts torture the first thing that helps is to recognize that it\u0027s happening, so recognize the repeated messages, sometimes in my abusers\u0027 voices, to hurt her kill myself, or seeing flashes of myself doing that like close ups which parts of me were taught to do by practicing. Then it helps to directly counteract those messages, remind everyone inside that the cult is cruel and diabolical and evil; everything they taught us is to only benefit them and hurt us and so we want the opposite of them, we want safety and compassion and healing and love. It helps to talk to others inside, to write out opposite messages. It can help to think of and visualize the people we love who we would never ever want to hurt and that can be an extra wall or a last wall. And it can also really help to ask someone safe who we care about to give us counter messages; their compassion and love can cut through the mind control and hate. I also have asked folks inside to counter the messages and alert me when it\u0027s happening. and I\u0027ve also used grounding and calming techniques, and staying in the present, helping folk inside see that this is the present not the past. And reminding folks inside that we don\u0027t want to die, we just want things to be happier and easier and find more love and compassion and good.

      "description": "TW: cult torture, mind control, su1c1dal ideation. I had a rough mental health day yesterday after I told my naturopath and naturopath student a new-to-me, very painful torture memory. Doing that triggered off old mind control messages to unalive myself (which I will never do), combined with really intense, overwhelming despair, depression, grief. Usually I can recognize mind control going on but I was stuffing it down and having a hard time thinking through it. I used so many coping techniques including tapping, nervous system regulation techniques, homeopathic remedies, grounding, comforting, and it would shift it for a little while and then it would come back just as hard or harder. It took me most of the day to understand why that mind control got triggered - that I told a really painful new trauma memory. Then when I talked to my friend who is also a cult survivor she reminded me it wasn\u0027t just the specific trauma memory I told that is so raw and deep and more full than my memories usually are, it was also that I told a helping professional. I have so much mind control against doing that, and I remember very specific things the cult did to keep me from talking especially to any helping professionals. Once I connected it up it helped shift and move it a lot faster. It\u0027s still there some today but it\u0027s not as bad at all. We *can* move through mind control and old cult messages taught through torture. It helps to have inner communication, inner cooperation, awareness that mind control has been set off, and some support. More detail in my video. #cultsurvivor #mindcontrol #ramcoa",

      "description": "TW: cult torture, mind control. There are times of year when it feels so hard to get through and I don\u0027t know how I will, when the grief and sadness and despair and depression are so strong. I think when that happens I am reliving what I felt during the cult torture, as well as responding to old mind control messages to unalive myself that the cult deliberately gave to specific parts of me (DID). \nThere are many ways to help that. One is doing rescue work where I ask folks inside to take me back to when they felt that way, relive the memory with them, then send the abusers away in my memory, comfort the folks inside who were traumatized, give them new messages and ask if they want new jobs, or slowly change how they are in the world or with me. But I can only do that when I\u0027m feeling safe enough. Another way is to write out the old mind control messages or trauma or draw it out. Another is to talk to my therapist or a friend or support who can hear me with compassion and empathy. I also now use nervous system regulation techniques which can help my body feel safe and then folks inside feel safe and remind us that we\u0027re not being abused anymore, that we are safe, that we have choices now and can choose to find comfort. Comfort is also another big thing, it can help. I end up having chocolate, hugging squishmallows, hugging a person if I feel safe with them, reading a good book. I think if we\u0027re only doing one or very few of those things it makes it harder to get through. like when I was only processing memory all the time I was flooding. I needed to know the information but not in that way; it was overwhelming. But if I only do positive distraction or reassurance the trauma and all the emotion is still sitting there in me and it\u0027s not getting out, but a combination of those things helps. I hope these things might help you, too, and that you have support when you need it. #cultsurvivor #didsystem #mindcontrol #ramcoasurvivor #traumahealing",

      "description": "TW: cult torture survivor, Mother\u0027s Day. I have been dissociating so hard about Mother\u0027s Day because it is such a hard time of year for me; it is used in the  cult torture. Usually I am so dissociated from it that I can\u0027t stay aware of it until maybe the day but I still have a rough time leading up to it and on the day, so this year I am trying to stay more aware of it which is hard. But it was hard even without staying aware; I still had a rough time because of the time of year, and I think it\u0027s healthier to stay aware. Mother\u0027s Day is hard because of cults use it, increasing the torture, r@pe, and mind control and doing specific things. But it\u0027s also always been hard because I had an abusive mother who sexually abused me, physically abused me, psychologically abused me, and of course tortured me. And now this year I have the added awareness of the grief of my mother parts who were forcibly impregnated and forced to bear children in the cult torture and that is an added layer of deep grief. So I am trying to do things to self-soothe, maybe some art, definitely some treats, reading a good book or watching a good show, talking to a good friend about the trauma and to my therapist. I know that Mother\u0027s Day is hard for so many people for so many reasons. I hope if it\u0027s rough for you too that you also do some things that help you and don\u0027t hurt you, or soothing are comforting, that you get some support, and that it is not as hard as it has been before.

This is the first time I stayed fully aware of them instead of dissociating the way I used to, and I had near constant body memories, old programming messages to hurt myself or unalive myself which I will never do, flashes of memory of the ways they reenacted some of the religious aspects and used them, and other memories, and it was a struggle. But it was also easier because I talked a lot of the day with a cult curvivor friend and that helped a lot and I used a lot of positive distraction as well but stayed aware. But it was rough. I felt relief this morning before some depression and grief came at me but it was not as bad as the last few days; I am so glad it\u0027s over.

I don\u0027t believe that we need to forgive our abusers to heal. I believe that we need to forgive ourselves for things that we feel responsible for even though they weren\u0027t our responsibility, like for me not being able to save other victims while I was being tortured. But I don\u0027t believe that we need to forgive our abusers. They chose to abuse and torture and rape and murder. And I have seen great healing in myself over the years without forgiving them. I think forgiveness is like accepting what they did or saying it\u0027s okay. If you personally feel like you need to forgive your abusers that is your choice but I think it\u0027s important not to push one\u0027s belief on anyone else.

I was talking with another cult survivor who reminded me Easter is coming up. Easter is one of the times that cult increases very specific torture and mind control messages about unaliving ourselves if we\u0027re not still being tortured. For me it helps to realize that, to make that connection, and to specifically counter those messages. I would never unalive myself; I have lots of safeguards against it and I know it\u0027s old cult messages. I also think it helps to talk with other survivors or a therapist or with someone who can remind you that you have a hard time every year at certain times of year, and it is from the trauma and mind control and you\u0027re going to get through it. #cultsurvivor #traumatok #mindcontrol  #ramcoa #didsystem",

I was talking with my naturopath the other day about how I felt so guilty that I couldn\u0027t protect others in the cult torture even though I tried so hard. I couldn\u0027t even protect myself. She reminded me that I was one person facing a group of organized people with weapons who killed and tortured and raped, and how could I have protected others and myself? It\u0027s something that my therapist has told me before and reminded me of. It\u0027s something I know intellectually but I forget when I have new memories come forward and I am reliving them or I have parts of me who went through those memories come forward more in my body to tell me about them. I think it helps to remember how vulnerable we were, how organized the torture and my control and abuse was, and how even if we fought or even if we had parts of ourselves that felt like they were strong it wasn\u0027t their fault or our fault that we couldn\u0027t protect ourselves or others. It\u0027s so important that we have compassion for ourselves. #cultsurvivor #ramcoa #traumatok #didsystem",

A few days ago I was having body memories of very specific torture that was done to me by the cult (more details in the video), but I was having trouble figuring out if it was body memory or not, because I used to assume that everything I felt in my body that didn\u0027t feel right was body memory because I was having trauma memories all the time, like nausea. But then I found out that some of the problems were physical (gluten intolerance, gall bladder, etc.) and so then I started assuming that everything was physical. But I think some is body memory and some is physical. I talked it through with a survivor friend and I think for me if it goes on for days and days and is a constant or is super intense or always happens around the same time like every night it\u0027s probably something to check out with a doctor. But if it comes and goes then it is likely body memory, especially if it is in specific areas where the torture was done and feels like the torture or responss I had to it. I may not have it right but it feels right for me for now. And I think it\u0027s always a good idea to check with a doctor. #cultsurvivor #traumatok #ramcoasurvivor #traumahealing",

I still don\u0027t understand it. They were trying to make me like them, they were trying to mold me into their image and make me lack compassion and empathy and make me enjoy others\u0027 pain and they couldn\u0027t do it.\n\n I remember being about five maybe six, on an altar being r@ped and looking up at my r@pist, my abuser who was enjoying my pain and terror, who was getting off on it so much, and the cries of other kids being r@ped and tortured and abused, and thinking \u0022I will never be like you, I choose to be the opposite of you.\u0022 They tortured me more, they increased the mind control more, they forced me to do horrific things, but they couldn\u0027t make me like them, they couldn\u0027t take away my good soul. \n\nI kept splitting off parts of myself, some to do what they were forcing me to do so I wouldn\u0027t lose my innocence and my sanity, so that I could survive and live, but I also created parts of me to heal and work on healing, to try and get safe. \n\nThere were parts of me who would try and protect the other kids and even adults, protect them or help them in the ways that I could, and the cult could not stamp that out. Eventually they realized that and instead of trying to force me to be an abuser they kept putting me in the role of victim every time. But that didn\u0027t change it for me, my desire to get safe, my desire to heal, my desire to help others; they couldn\u0027t stamp that out. \n\nThey tried with everything in them; that included deliberate mind control and torture and skewed abuse scenarios, and they still couldn\u0027t do that, they still couldn\u0027t make me like them. That was true for me and for many other kids, though there were also many kids who did become like them and took their place or stood alongside them to enjoy torturing and murdering and r@ping other people. \n\nBut just because we\u0027ve been tortured or abused and deliberately put on the path of becoming like our abusers doesn\u0027t mean we become like them. We can fight back in all the ways we can, we can work on healing and getting safe, and then when we\u0027re safe we have even more choice and more ways to put good in the world and to protect ourselves and others. I hope you know that and you see that in yourself too. #cultsurvivor #traumatok #didsystem #dissociativeidentity #ramcoa",

      "description": "TW: cult torture survivor. Today is Dissociative Identity Disorder Awareness Day or DID Awareness Day. DID is much more common than many people think, and you may know someone in your life who lives with it. I\u0027m Cheryl Rainfield, author of SCARS, STAINED, HUNTED, VISIONS, and I live with polyfragmented DID as a direct result of the cult torture that I survived as a child, as a teen, as an adult. The parts of me were created as a child and a teen, but some even in later years as the torture continued. DID is not crazy; it is a creative, intelligent way of coping with extreme, ongoing childhood torture and abuse and mind control, a way to escape when we couldn\u0027t physically escape, when there was no other way to escape except for splitting off parts in the mind. And that\u0027s a huge part of how I survived and how I kept my sanity and how I kept my good soul intact.\n\nFor me it\u0027s been really important to work on inner cooperation and inner communication, and working with other parts inside of me, making sure that I and all parts of me are aware that it\u0027s the present and what\u0027s going on in the outside world. So I don\u0027t lose time anymore, but I worked for a long time to do that, and to work with everyone inside. It also helps me to do rescue work with parts of me, to listen to when they were created and how they were created, like the abuse or torture event, and then to go back and visualize saving them from that and helping them learn a new job if the job or the role that they have is not healthy one. \n\nBecause I am a cult torture survivor, not all the parts of me were created by me; there are some parts of me that cult intentionally to have very specific jobs and roles that they wanted, like having parts of me who would deny the memories, the abuse and trauma, who would make me doubt it, would keep me from remembering or keep me from talking, or who would hurt me emotionally or physically. Those are very specific jobs that the cult created in me and wanted, and it is common for cult torture survivors who have DID to have some of those jobs or roles inside. It helps so much to work with those parts of us, and to see that they\u0027re not scary; they were created because they had to or the cult would have continued and increased the torture and mind control, so it was survival. So their root or their true role underneath it all Is to protect us and help us survive and get through. So when you know that it helps; it helps make it so much easier to work with them even though they can put up a tough facade.\n\n I hope that if you know someone who has DID that you will listen to their experience, because everyone\u0027s experience can be a little or a lot different, and also read a book about it, or watch some videos, or read some articles. It helps to have people who could hear in a real way. #didawareness #dissociativeidentitydisorder #cultsurvivor #multiplepersonalities #ramcoasurvivor",

      "description": "TW: satanic cult torture survivor.  The people that are saying that cult abuse is not real, that satanic cult abuse is not real, that it\u0027s all \u0022satanic panic\u0022 and conspiracy theories, and where\u0027s the evidence, are using the same language that our cult abusers used, and that abusers use, and that\u0027s not a side that I would want to be on. I\u0027m Cheryl Rainfield, author of SCARS, STAINED, HUNTED, VISIONS, and I am a satanic cult torture survivor as well as a survivor of the KKK and Nazi Cults and some other smaller ones. My parents were part of intergenerational, interconnected cults, and so were my entire extended family and many of their friends. I am lucky to be alive and I am grateful to be alive.  \n\nSo some people ask where is the proof? First of all I think you should believe survivors when we speak out; it is horrific and painful and hard to talk about and we are some of the most silenced survivors in society. People so often don\u0027t want to believe even rape; they have trouble believing cult torture. Many of us survivors have internal scarring, where it wouldn\u0027t show, where most people wouldn\u0027t see, but my doctor found it. I had gouges in my teeth from when my father and other abusers used dental tools on me for torture, which my dentist found, which I have now ground down because of how many years I\u0027ve been grinding my teeth. \n\nThere is the truth in our words, and our memories, and our trauma. I would not have DID, dissociative identity disorder, without haven\u0027t had to split off parts of myself to survive the torture and the mind control, and having my cult abusers specifically, deliberately create splits and parts of me to take on jobs that they wanted those parts of me to take on, like finding ways to hurt myself emotionally and shut myself up and keep myself quiet. Those are very standard jobs cult abusers give us. I would not have the c-ptsd, the trauma, the triggers that plague me almost every day, the triggers down to trauma memories, the debilitating way that trauma memories can take me over and the effects of trauma, so many effects of trauma everyday and every night of my life. I have shown so many signs of abuse and extreme abuse and torture my entire life, and teachers and other people were usually concerned but didn\u0027t understand what they were seeing and didn\u0027t recognize it. \n\nWhen we tell you that we have been through torture we mean actual torture - physical torture, sexual torture, psychological torture. Satanic cult abuse is real, and there are so many survivors. Cult abuse is real and there are so many survivors. I call it cult torture because it was torture. We are here and I hope that you believe us and I hope that you don\u0027t fall into the trap that abusers want you to and use the phrases \u0022satanic panic\u0022 or \u0022conspiracy theories\u0022 to talk about satanic cult torture survivors. Thank you for listening. #cultsurvivor #ramcoasurvivor #believesurvivors",

      "description": "TW: satanic cult torture survivor.\nThere is a creator on tiktok, a fellow author, who is trying to discredit satanic cult survivors, saying that it is all \u0022satanic panic\u0022 and conspiracy theories, and that there was no evidence.\n\nYou may know me, I am Cheryl Rainfield, author of SCARS, STAINED, HUNTED, VISIONS, and I have been open since I was a teen about being a cult torture survivor. My parents and extended family were part of intergenerational, interconnected cults, and that included satanic, KKK, and Neo Nazi and some other smaller cults. This was incredibly organized and intentional. It was torture and mind control and trafficking. It was horrific and I\u0027m really grateful to be alive.\n\nI believe other survivors. I think it is so important to believe and hear other survivors. I think it\u0027s important to lift up voices of survivors. I know how hard it can be for people to hear and believe, to want to believe in our \u0022civilized\u0022 society that these horrific things happen. I think about how hard it is for so many people to believe a woman who\u0027s been raped, how many people try and tear her apart and say that she\u0027s lying, child sexual abuse survivors. Then you go to the extreme organized cult torture that happens in our society - people don\u0027t want to listen or believe, but it\u0027s real and it happens. There is proof.\n\nBut organized cults like this make it very hard persona virus to be believed and to see evidence but there is evidence. Go to website ra-info.org and also traumadissociation.com, and you will find links to and discussion about cases where they have found evidence of satanic cult abuse such as the McMartin case where they found tunnels and bones and cauldrons exactly where the kids of the daycare said they would be. That is eerily reminiscent of the tunnels that have been found under some Hollywood homes and extreme abuse that is very close to or is cult torture that is coming out about P Diddy and associates.\n\nI\u0027m going to talk about some detail about cult torture; it may be hard to hear and so if you don\u0027t want to hear please scroll away. One thing that cults do to try and destroy evidence and make sure that kids and teens and adults survivors when they speak out are not believed, is that they force us victims to ingest the flesh of people who were murdered, to get rid of a lot of evidence (and traumatize us more). It is done in many different ways including grinding up the bones.\n\nAnother thing that makes it harder for people to find evidence  is that in organized cult torture like I survived with satanic, KKK, and Nazi every person who is born assigned female at birth  or with a uterus is forced to bear a  child or children, usually multiple children, for the cult. The babies are usually born early, they are not registered in hospitals, they\u0027re not born in hospitals, they are born in cult settings and they are grown up to the age they are allowed to live. They are kept in cult settings only where they don\u0027t go to school, they don\u0027t have access to other things and then those kids are killed. That is a huge part of the murder that happens, the torture.\n\nThere are also a lot of people in positions of power; I remember police officers, social workers, judges, lawyers, doctors, and nurses, and they all worked in conjunction with each other so that there was as little possible evidence to be found, except of course in our bodies, and to help keep us silent. \n\nOrganized cults build on years and years of torture and mind control techniques to keep us silent, and so speaking out is so incredibly hard. I  hope that you can believe and hear survivors, and hold space for us even though it is so much pain and trauma. I think it\u0027s so important that we believe survivors, support survivors, and that we don\u0027t try and tear other survivors down.\n\n I\u0027m also very aware that in the organized cult torture, the satanic, KKK, and Nazi, that our abusers did sometimes dress up as police and doctors and nurses and teachers to try and make us be afraid of those people in positions of power and to keep us from talking. It was very intentional. But there were also cult members who had those professions in society.\n\nI don\u0027t believe that my cult abusers  actually believed in Satanism; I think they used the language and the clothing that they wore, and the religious artifacts, to try and discredit us more when we would actually talk because who wants to believe that? And to create more fear. And for Satanism they used Christianity in an upside down way and they used many of the same religious holidays and that makes it even more triggering for a cult torture survivors because there is a constant bombardment of language that is used in cult torture that is in our society and built into our society and our holidays.\n\n I hope you believe and listen to and support survivors and that you don\u0027t use phrases like satanic panic or conspiracy theories.\n\nThank you for hearing me. #cultsurvivor #ramcoasurvivor #believesurvivors",
