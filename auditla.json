I believe there are a lot of good people in that building who don\u2019t belong trapped in there. This is my honest plea to you.\n\nIf you ever decide you\u2019re ready to go\u2026 I\u2019ll be right here, ready to scoot you out myself.\n\n#DearKen\n#AuditLA\n#ItsACult\n#scientology",

Of course all of a sudden I was having connection issues. I guess Janet has a jammer. I hope she got the message that she is not wanted or welcomed here any longer.  Thank you Kristi for spotting her in the crowd. I missed the evil elf.",
