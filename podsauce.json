      "description": "In this extended interview, hear Caroline Cole and Rebecca Mellinger, hosts of \u201CTrapped in Treatment,\u201D go into more detail about how their podcast exposes the troubled teen industry, the influence of their executive producer #ParisHilton, and how communities can support young people.\n\nThe idea for this podcast was sparked when Caroline and Rebecca accompanied Paris to a rally in Utah for survivors of the Provo Canyon School, a so-called mental health treatment school/facility for troubled teens that Paris attended. While these sorts of \u201Ctroubled teen\u201D facilities have been around since the 1960s, Senators and advocates have been trying to shed light on the abuses that they and others have suffered inside. The release of Paris\u2019 2020 documentary This Is Paris truly shifted the tides when Paris opened up about the PTSD she suffered from the four different \u201Ctroubled teen\u201D boarding schools she attended in her youth.\n\nAlong with Paris, Caroline and Rebecca realized that this is a pervasive issue that #TrappedInTreatment would not only expose to the public, but give other survivors of these schools a platform to share their stories.\n\nAlesha asks the two how parents are convinced to send their children to these schools and what they are told happens inside their walls. Caroline explains that with a lack of regulations, extreme marketing techniques, and lots and lots of lies and deception, parents don\u2019t believe their children about what\u2019s happening, and children are told to not even bother trying to accuse the schools of wrongdoing.\n\nRead the full article here: https://podsauce.com/episodes/trapped-in-treatment-extended-interview/\n\n#Podcast\n\nFollow us on social\n\uD83C\uDF00 https://twitter.com/thepodsauce\n\uD83C\uDF00 https://www.instagram.com/thepodsauce\n\uD83C\uDF00 https://www.facebook.com/thepodsauce/\n\n\uD83C\uDF00 Podsauce covers the world of podcasting to help podcast lovers and newbies #GetATaste for new series and can\u2019t-miss episodes\u203C\uFE0F",
