That\u0027s when it hit me: this isn\u0027t just bad television, it\u0027s cult-like behavior.

Everyone\u0027s playing a role, mass fawning to keep the system running, even though we all know it\u0027s broken. I also break down why CBS\u0027s recent promise to \u0027get real\u0027 is likely just another rebrand, \u0026 why the actual revolution in media won\u0027t come from corporations\u2014it\u0027ll come from citizen journalists on the ground risking something to tell the truth. People are starved for authenticity. The inertia of these broken systems is powerful, but the future belongs to those who drop the performance \u0026 speak unfiltered truth.

      "description": "After spending over 10 years in a cult, I became obsessed with recognizing the patterns. And now? I see them everywhere\u2014especially in our political tribes. Everyone\u0027s busy calling the other side a cult while refusing to examine their own behavior. In this episode of WTF is on my Mind?!, I\u0027m asking you to do something uncomfortable: question YOUR side. Not theirs. YOURS. Using \u201CThe Village\u201D by M. Night Shyamalan as a metaphor, I break down how echo chambers work, how we justify our worst behavior, and why both sides think only the OTHER guys have been captured by extremists. Here\u0027s the test: if you\u0027re listening to this thinking \u0022yeah, but MY side is different\u0022 - you may have proved my point. This isn\u0027t about left vs right. It\u0027s about recognizing when you\u0027ve stopped thinking and started defending. When accountability becomes shunning. When influence becomes coercion. When you\u0027re so convinced you\u0027re fighting Nazis that you can\u0027t see your own reflection and everything becomes an option, including violence. I went through this humbling. It was the best thing I ever did. And thousands of people are doing it right now\u2014waking up and realizing what they believed was deranged. Are you brave enough to look? If this video made you uncomfortable, good. Share it with someone who needs to hear this. And if you\u0027re angry at me right now, I get it. Just ask yourself why.

      "description": "In this episode of WTF is on My Mind?!, I sit down with Dr. Peter Salerno \u2014 a retired psychotherapist and author who has spent decades studying personality disorders, psychopathy, and complex trauma. Our conversation dives straight into one of the most heated debates in psychology: are narcissists shaped by trauma and upbringing, or are some people simply born with traits that evolve into full-blown disorders? Dr. Salerno challenges the conventional belief that all narcissism stems from childhood wounds, pointing to research in genetics and neuroscience that shows a far more complicated picture. We also unpack his concept of \u201Ctraumatic cognitive dissonance\u201D \u2014 the paralyzing confusion survivors experience when an abuser deliberately installs contradictory realities in their minds. It\u2019s not just internal conflict; it\u2019s an engineered state of disorientation that keeps people stuck in toxic relationships and systems of control. From there, the discussion widens: we explore how support groups can restore a shattered sense of reality, why some people lose touch with their identity after abuse, and what it really takes to rebuild a self when you were never given the space to form one in the first place. We also look at narcissistic emptiness, the myth of the \u201Chidden shame,\u201D and why grandiosity \u2014 not insecurity \u2014 may actually be the engine driving narcissistic behavior. The conversation doesn\u2019t stay confined to therapy rooms. We talk about the ways these dynamics show up in society at large \u2014 from political polarization to media manipulation \u2014 and how it all echoes the same psychological warfare found in abusive relationships. This was a fascinating and unsettling deep dive into human psychology, which left me with a whole new lens on abuse, personality, and power.

      "description": "In this episode of WTF is On My Mind?!, filmmaker and whistleblower Mark Vicente explores what happens when we try to understand an irrational or dangerous mind. Whether it\u2019s a cult leader, an abuser, or the mainstream media\u2014attempting to \u201Cmap\u201D insanity can destabilize one\u2019s own sanity. Brain Talk: How Mind Mapping Brain Science Can Change Your Life \u0026 Everyone In It - by David Schnarch Mark unpacks the concept of mind mapping\u2014our brain\u2019s instinct to model the thoughts and intentions of others\u2014and shows how it becomes distorted in high-control environments. Drawing from his experience inside NXIVM, he reflects on: The hyper-vigilance around Keith Raniere. The split between a \u201Ccult self\u201D and the real self. The chaos of \u201Cspaghetti brain\u201D when irrational behavior is normalized. But this is more than just a story about cults. Mark connects these patterns to everyday life, revealing: How media propaganda and lies mimic cult indoctrination. Why truth-tellers are often branded \u201Cextremists.\u201D The cost of normalizing hypocrisy, duplicity, and deception as \u201Cbusiness as usual.\u201D At its core, the episode is about the hidden psychological toll of mapping madness\u2014and why feeling disturbed may actually be the sanest response to the world right now.

      "description": "In this episode of WTF Is On My Mind?!, Mark Vicente pulls back the curtain on one of the most insidious tools of social control: shunning \u2014 not just as a personal act of rejection, but as a systemic, psychological weapon masquerading as moral high ground.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about cults. It\u2019s about how cult behavior has gone mainstream \u2014 how families, political factions, media outlets, and activist circles now use public exile and cold silence to punish dissent and demand conformity. Drawing on a recent New York Times opinion piece that unintentionally exposes the creeping logic of ideological purity, Mark examines the difference between healthy boundaries and coercive exile, between critical thinking and performative allegiance.\n\nHe also reflects on his own experience inside NXIVM, where shunning was formal doctrine \u2014 and how eerily familiar those same dynamics look in our current cultural climate. From mocking deaths to cutting off loved ones for their beliefs, we\u2019re in dangerous territory when belonging becomes conditional on orthodoxy \u2014 be it political, medical, or spiritual.\n\nBut all is not doom and gloom. This episode also looks at how the spell can break \u2014 how real human connection, outside the algorithms and echo chambers, can restore our capacity for nuance, empathy, and even disagreement without destruction.\n\nMark\u2019s take is blunt, piercing, and layered with lived experience \u2014 and it just might make you think twice about who\u2019s really being \u201Ccultish.\u201D\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/13/opinion/family-politics-arguments-right-wing.html\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1m0iyya/nyt_is_it_time_to_stop_snubbing_your_rightwing/\nSupport the show\nThe views and opinions expressed on WTF is on my Mind?! do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast or Mark Vicente.

      "title": "Epstein, Political Blackmail \u0026 Why No One\u2019s Coming to Save Us!",
      "description": "What happens when people finally see through the lies? Mark Vicente breaks down the Epstein cover-up, government blackmail operations, and why we can\u0027t wait for heroes to save us. Mark connects the dots between cult dynamics and political power structures, drawing from his experience as a NXIVM whistleblower.\n\nThe Epstein Cover-Up and What It Really Means: Mark digs into why the official narrative around Epstein\u0027s death and the missing client list feels so transparently false. But here\u0027s the twist: those blatant lies aren\u0027t meant to convince you or me. They\u0027re messages to the people on that list, telling them they\u0027re protected. When you understand that intelligence agencies need leverage over powerful people, the whole honey trap operation starts making sense. There\u0027s missing tape footage, there are allegations of lists, and Mark knows some of the women involved personally. This isn\u0027t conspiracy theory territory anymore.\n\nHow Government Blackmail Actually Works: Drawing from his NXIVM experience, Mark explains how Keith Raniere\u0027s \u0022Faust\u0022 blackmail organization was basically a small-scale version of how intelligence agencies operate. Raniere didn\u0027t invent this shit, he learned it from somewhere. When attorneys general or presidents want to prosecute something and suddenly back down with flimsy excuses, Mark wonders: did they get a phone call? A visit? Maybe a threat against their family? The system runs on leverage, and the people we think are in charge aren\u0027t the ones with real power.\n\nWatching Both Political Parties Split Apart: Mark sees something fascinating happening right now. The Israel-Palestine issue has bifurcated the Democratic Party. The Epstein cover-up is splitting Republicans. Both sides are fracturing because people are finally seeing through the cult-like thinking that says you have to support your leader no matter what they do. It looks chaotic, but Mark thinks this is actually what happens when cults collapse. People start questioning everything and referring back to their own moral compass instead of blindly following.\n\nWhy We\u0027re Done Waiting for Heroes: The most hopeful part of this whole mess? When you finally accept that there are no great leaders coming to save us, you\u0027re left with yourself. Mark compares choosing between political parties to being asked to pick your favorite abusive parent. Maybe they\u0027re both just abusive, and maybe it\u0027s time to stop looking for the perfect mommy or daddy figure. The legendary people from the movies aren\u0027t in politics. They might be in us, and that realization forces you to become the kind of leader you\u0027ve been waiting for.\n\nMentioned in This Episode:\nWhitney Webb - \u0022One Nation Under Blackmail\u0022\nEric Weinstein on media narratives\nFrank Parlato and his anti-NXIVM blog\nKeith Raniere\u0027s \u0022Faust\u0022 blackmail organization\nSupport the show\nThe views and opinions expressed on WTF is on my Mind?! do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast or Mark Vicente.

      "description": "In this deeply intimate conversation, Mark sits down with his old friend Karen Unterreiner \u2014 a woman who spent 4 decades at the epicenter of what the world came to know as NXIVM. Once a high-ranking member, deeply entangled both professionally \u0026 personally with Keith Raniere, Karen shares her long journey of waking up from psychological captivity. What does it mean to have your entire adult identity shaped by someone else\u0027s manipulative design? How do you start to rebuild a self when that self was never fully yours to begin with? Karen \u0026 Mark dive into the mechanics of grooming, the slow erosion of boundaries, \u0026 the double binds that kept people loyal. They unpack the devastating misuse of \u0027ethics\u0027 as a weapon, the shame loops that silenced dissent, \u0026 the emotional landmines survivors navigate when they begin to deprogram. Together, they reflect on friendship, betrayal, \u0026 the unexpected ways connection can spark liberation \u2014 even years after separation. This episode is not just about NXIVM. It\u0027s about the broader pattern of coercive control \u2014 in groups, relationships, families, \u0026 institutions \u2014 \u0026 what it takes to truly reclaim your mind. \u26A0\uFE0F Content Warning: This episode contains discussion of psychological abuse, grooming, coercive control, gaslighting, \u0026 long-term trauma.

Drawing from his own lived experience in NXIVM (aka ESP), Mark explains how these systems use circular logic, linguistic reframing, and fear-based conditioning to keep followers compliant and questioning outsiders. He explores: The emotional traps of \u201Cbeing at cause\u201D The psychological architecture of films like The Village How certain keywords trigger shame, dismissal, or moral superiority The chilling trend of algorithmic censorship around trauma-related crimes Why courage means examining your own side \u2014 not just pointing fingers at \u201Cthem\u201D This one might ruffle some feathers. But if no one\u2019s pissed off\u2026 is he even doing his job?

      "description": "In this expletive laden \u0026 unfiltered solo episode, Mark Vicente dives deep into the subtle, insidious ways abusive individuals \u0026 systems exploit our longing to grow, reflect, \u0026 \u0027be better.\u0027 He explores the psychological unraveling that happens when introspection is hijacked to suppress personal agency. Drawing from his lived experience in NXIVM, Mark unpacks how coercive groups often encourage relentless self-examination not to empower, but to disable. The more you question yourself, the less you question them. He shares how terms like \u0027narcissism on a spectrum\u0027 \u0026 \u0027interdependence\u0027 are weaponized to gaslight dissent \u0026 justify control\u2014especially over sensitive, self-aware individuals. The episode also takes aim at the modern digital landscape, where platforms like YouTube reward hysteria, obedience, \u0026 superficiality while shadowbanning nuanced, divergent voices. Mark wrestles with a painful dilemma: should he tailor his messaging to appease the algorithm gods\u2014or remain steadfastly authentic \u0026 risk invisibility? This is a reflection on the price of truth, the cost of being \u0027too sensitive,\u0027 \u0026 the mind games that keep good people doubting themselves while abusers thrive. Themes Explored: \u2022 Weaponized introspection \u0026 the psychology of disempowerment \u2022 Narcissistic abuse vs. healthy self-assertion \u2022 False narratives around \u0027everyone\u0027s a narcissist\u0027 \u2022 Coercive control in high-control groups \u2022 The trap of endless personal responsibility \u2022 Digital censorship, shadow-banning \u0026 algorithmic obedience \u2022 The tension between authenticity \u0026 visibility in online spaces The views \u0026 opinions expressed on WTF is on my Mind?! do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast or Mark Vicente.

      "description": "In this powerful \u0026 revealing episode, filmmaker Mark Vicente sits down with Dr. Karen Mitchell, founder of the Kalmor Institute \u0026 the author of one of the most groundbreaking PhD theses ever written on dark personalities. https://kalmor.com.au/ https://x.com/karenmitchell__ Karen shares the results of decades of research \u0026 direct experience, unveiling a chilling but deeply important truth: narcissists, psychopaths, Machiavellians, cult leaders, toxic executives, \u0026 coercive controllers may all be subsets of one single high-level predator\u2014what she calls the Persistent Predatory Personality (PPP). Together, Mark \u0026 Karen explore: - How these individuals operate in corporate, medical, religious, \u0026 legal systems - Why many are high-functioning, charming, \u0026 completely hidden - How academia \u0026 the justice system often enable or overlook this abuse - Why \u0027the mask\u0027 of empathy is often just a calculated act - The emotional, mental, \u0026 reputational devastation experienced by targets - Red flags to look out for\u2014and why reporting often makes things worse before it gets better - The tragic impact on children, families, \u0026 even democracy This is not just a conversation about abuse. It\u0027s a call to wake up to the patterns, the tactics, \u0026 the systems that allow this behavior to thrive. If you\u0027ve ever dealt with narcissistic abuse, manipulation, or invisible harm\u2014this episode is essential. Key Topics: - The truth behind the \u0027Dark Triad\u0027 \u0026 the \u0027Dark Tetrad\u0027 - Why most research has been looking in the wrong place - The danger of self-reporting studies when studying liars - Coercive control: from domestic violence to cult dynamics - Why dark personalities are attracted to power, law, medicine, \u0026 even charity work - The difference between true predators \u0026 trauma survivors who mimic similar behaviors - Why our society is desperately under-equipped to deal with these people The views \u0026 opinions expressed on WTF is on my Mind?! do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast or Mark Vicente.

      "description": "In this solo episode, filmmaker \u0026 truth-seeker Mark Vicente shares what\u0027s been stirring in his mind\u2014from the deeply personal to the culturally explosive. He starts with an exploration of dignity\u2014what it is, why it matters, \u0026 how it\u0027s the missing ingredient in many conversations about boundaries \u0026 self-respect. Through stories \u0026 personal insight, he dives into the internal work required to reclaim one\u0027s worth, especially after experiences of coercive control, narcissistic abuse, or cult entanglement. Mark also challenges the idea that we can simply \u0027move on\u0027 from trauma. Drawing from his conversations with cult survivors, he shares why unprocessed pain never truly stays buried\u2014and how it inevitably seeps into our relationships, our bodies, \u0026 our choices if left unhealed. Then things take a turn: he unpacks recent archaeological discoveries beneath the Pyramid of Khafre using SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) scans\u2014findings that seem to confirm the theories long ridiculed as \u0027conspiracies.\u0027 He calls out the mainstream resistance to new truths, especially when they disrupt long-held narratives. This leads into a passionate reflection on shadowbanning, censorship, \u0026 algorithmic suppression\u2014including what appears to be a deliberate silencing of a previous podcast episode featuring a Black female guest whose voice, ironically, challenges the very systems that claim to protect marginalized voices. Lastly, Mark questions what we even mean when we say \u0027the world.\u0027 Is it the real world\u2014or the carefully filtered version we\u0027ve been fed through screens, algorithms, \u0026 corporate media? This episode is messy, real, \u0026 deeply human. It\u0027s not about having answers\u2014it\u0027s about asking better questions. If you\u0027ve ever felt like the world\u0027s gone mad, this one\u0027s for you.

      "description": "My Thoughts on Cult Mentality and Moral Dilemmas \u2013 Alison Mack, NXIVM, and Beyond In this episode: I dive into some deep and personal reflections about the dangers of avoiding moral questions, both in cults and in society at large. Drawing from my own experiences with NXIVM, I talk about Alison Mack, her attempts to question her role, and how Keith Raniere manipulated her into silence. I also explore how this same kind of gaslighting happens beyond cults \u2013 in politics, social movements, and even everyday life, when we stay loyal to our \u0022team\u0022 at the cost of our own moral compass. It\u2019s about confronting the uncomfortable questions and staying curious, no matter where you find yourself. 00:00 - Intro Teaser: Are We the Baddies? I begin with the question no one wants to ask but must: \u201CAre we doing something wrong?\u201D This sets the stage for a deeper look into avoiding moral questioning. 02:00 - Alison Mack\u2019s Story Alison Mack once questioned her role in NXIVM, but Raniere manipulated her into doubting herself, a classic gaslighting move to keep her compliant. 04:30 - Gaslighting in NXIVM Raniere\u2019s tactic of framing questions as selfish behavior stopped people from critically thinking about the organization and its practices. 06:15 - Cult-Like Behavior in Society I discuss how this same tactic plays out in broader society, where groups refuse to question themselves and silence internal doubts. 08:00 - Fragmentation in Cults I reflect on a high-ranking NXIVM member who, under years of manipulation, became disconnected from reality, but no one dared to question her. 10:00 - Blind Loyalty in Groups I explore how group loyalty, in both cults and politics, can lead people to defend actions they would normally find immoral. 12:00 - Denial of Evil I discuss how people deny or justify real issues, like child trafficking, simply because the \u0022enemy\u0022 points them out. 13:45 - Defending Processed Food I reflect on how processed food has become defended by some, not because it\u2019s healthy, but because the opposing side says it\u2019s bad. 15:00 - Cults and Psychosis I emphasize the need for self-reflection to avoid falling into cult-like thinking, where group loyalty overrides personal values. 17:00 - Questioning Your Own Side I encourage viewers to challenge their own group when wrongdoing is evident, even if it means facing backlash. 18:00 - Final Thoughts: Stay Curious I end with a reminder to always stay curious, keep questioning, and avoid falling into blind loyalty or groupthink.

      "description": "The Dangers of Intolerance: Culty Behavior in Today\u0027s World In this episode, I delve into the unsettling parallels between cult behavior and the current climate of intolerance we see online and in society. Drawing from my experiences as a whistleblower against NXIVM and my understanding of manipulative dynamics, I explore how rigid ideologies and \u0022thought policing\u0022 mirror the very patterns of control used by cults. Key Points Discussed: Cults and Boundaries: How cult leaders establish unspoken rules and boundaries, making members fearful of stepping outside them. Ethics Police: The role of \u0022ethics police\u0022 in cults and how similar behaviors are emerging in the digital age, with individuals scrutinizing who others follow or what they say online. Toxic Empathy: The concept of \u0022toxic empathy,\u0022 where well-meaning individuals abandon true empathy in favor of aggressively enforcing their ideological beliefs. Labeling and Censorship: How modern-day label makers and censorship reflect cult-like mechanisms to control thought and silence dissent. The Importance of Curiosity: Encouraging open-mindedness and empathy as antidotes to the growing societal tendency to shut down differing perspectives. Join me as I unpack these crucial issues and encourage a more thoughtful and open approach to navigating complexity. 01:00 Recognizing the Patterns of Abuse in Cults 03:58 The Power of Label Makers in Shaping Public Opinion 09:10 The Importance of Curiosity, Open-Mindedness, and Empathy 14:49 The Dangers of Censorship and Silencing Opposing Viewpoints 19:39 Embracing Diversity of Thought Support the Show.

The trainer engages in manipulative and predatory behavior, including blackmailing clients and sharing explicit videos without consent. Despite clear crimes being committed, law enforcement has been unresponsive. Also BTW - The contrast between the trainer\u0027s charming facade and his conscienceless actions is mind-boggling.

We look at the ethical implications of A.I. and the lack of regulations and ethical constraints in its development. Adam discusses the state of Hollywood, describing it as a corrupt industry driven by money and power. He explores the impact of A.I. on storytelling and expresses his worries about the loss of creativity and the homogenization of content. We discuss Nolan A.I. - a creative tool that empowers writers and filmmakers by providing co-writing, coverage, and deliverable creation features. It focuses on the individual creator\u0027s style and ideas, rather than relying on pre-existing works. Adam asserts that this particular A.I. is designed to enhance creativity and provide objective feedback, eliminating biases and nepotism often found in the industry. It allows creators to retain control over their work and bypass traditional gatekeepers. The goal is to put the power back in the hands of creatives and disrupt the current education and production systems. However, we always need to be mindful of the ethical use of A.I. and the potential for it to be misused by those in power.

We discuss Adam\u0027s background as a bodyguard and close protection specialist, his experiences in the Mormon Church, and his journey of leaving the church. We also touch on the investigations department within the church and the control it exerts over its members. We explore themes of abuse, manipulation, and the fear of leaving a religious community. Adam discusses his journey from Mormonism to questioning and leaving the church. He talks about the indoctrination he experienced as a child and the fear-based teachings about God. We also explore propaganda and how it is prevalent in various aspects of society, including politics and intelligence operations. Adam emphasizes the importance of questioning and critical thinking in order to see through the lies and manipulation. He reflects on his journey as a filmmaker and the challenges he has faced in the industry. Adam discusses the importance of creating his own content and owning it, rather than acquiescing to the powers that be in Hollywood. He also explores the cult-like nature of the entertainment industry, highlighting the propaganda and manipulation that exists within it. 00:00 Intro 03:11 Adam\u0027s Background as a Bodyguard and Close Protection Specialist 13:06 The Investigations Department within the Mormon Church 27:22 Discovering Abuse and Questioning the Church 36:43 Leaving the Church and Facing the Consequences 38:36 Indoctrination and Fear-based Teachings 43:09 Questioning and Leaving the Church 44:08 Recognizing Patterns of Propaganda 47:30 The Power of Questioning and Critical Thinking 52:22 Finding Truth and Authenticity 01:19:25 Creating Your Own Content and Owning It 01:33:20 The Cult-Like Nature of the Entertainment Industry 01:44:12 Valuing Life and Personal Relationships 01:50:42 Favorite Films: \u0027The Grey,\u0027 \u0027Man on Fire,\u0027 and \u0027Blade Runner\u0027 Support the Show.

      "description": "In this Episode: Guy Pearce talks about why he reached out to me. We had an amazing, deep, and honest conversation covering cults, groups, his fascination with The Vow, and his take on acting and being human.Guy Pearce was born October 5, 1967 in the UK to Margaret Anne and Stuart Graham Pearce. His father was born in Auckland, New Zealand, to English and Scottish parents, while Guy\u0027s mother is English. Pearce and his family initially traveled to Australia for two years, after his father was offered the position of Chief test pilot for the Australian Government. Guy was just 3-years-old. After deciding to stay in Australia and settling in the Victorian city of Geelong, Guy\u0027s father was killed 5 years later in an aircraft test flight, leaving Guy\u0027s mother, a schoolteacher, to care for him and his older sister, Tracy.Having little interest in subjects at school like math or science, Guy favored art, drama and music. He joined local theatre groups at a young age and appeared in such productions as \u0022The King and I,\u0022 \u0022Fiddler on the Roof,\u0022 and \u0022The Wizard of Oz.\u0022 In 1985, just two days after his final high school exam, Guy started a four-year stint as \u0022Mike Young\u0022 on the popular Aussie soap Neighbours (1985). At age 20, Guy appeared in his first film, Heaven Tonight (1989), then, after a string of appearances in film, television and on the stage, he won the role of an outrageous drag queen in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994).He has amazed film critics and audiences, alike, with his magnificent performances in L.A. Confidential (1997), Memento (2000), The Proposition (2005), Factory Girl (2006), The Hurt Locker (2008), The King\u0027s Speech (2010) and the HBO mini-series, Mildred Pierce (2011). Next to acting, Guy has had a life-long passion for music and songwriting.Support the showWebsite: www.markvicente.comInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/markvicente/Twitter: https://twitter.com/markvicenteFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/markvicente/Theme Music: \u0022In Time\u0022 by Kollen",

      "description": "In this Episode: (PART 4 of 4) In March 2018 I recognized Keith Raniere was about to be arrested. Along with my fellow whistleblowers, we had spent the previous 9 months trying to get people out of NXIVM. I made one final attempt en masse to get my friends (true believers) to wake up before Raniere was arrested. I wrote a long letter to a select few friends on \u2018the inside\u2019 on March 10th, 2018 - 16 days before Keith Raniere was arrested in a Mexican Villa on March 26th, 2018. I sent it mostly to lower ranks because I knew that if I included the top of the organization, the higher ranks would have blocked it. I needed my friends who received the letter to have time to absorb what I was saying before they had to report it up the chain of command. This was my desperate attempt to try and wake my friends up before the arrests began. ~ Mark Vicente\u00A0Sections of the letter: Shunning, Whistleblower, The Blame Game, The Appearance of Calm, VWEEK2016, Slavery. Remember Africa, The Enablers, Your Future Selves\u0022Mirreyes\u0022 (my kings) https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3026433/Mirreyes-rich-kids-Mexican-elite-use-Instagram-wealth.htmlYour Future Selves.\u00A0Well, my rant has come to an end. As I said, that is 0.5%. I am well aware that this LONG letter may not move any of you. Too many EM\u2019s and The Knife. Also, some of you may be True Believers. But at least we can collectively never look back and say I didn\u2019t express this. That I didn\u2019t try. I am writing this hopefully to your future selves who will look back at this, maybe years from now and say HOLY SHIT!

I am nevertheless aghast at the level of contempt for women and cruelty toward women that is at the rotten core of this group. Raniere succeeds in fulfilling his sadistic need to enslave others through a kind of battering, his twisted rationales convincing followers, and not just the women, that self-torture and torture of others builds character.\u00A0 In fact, what he does is utterly self-serving, exploiting others entirely to feed the delusion of his own omnipotence.

Teachers who haven\u0027t dealt with their psychological shit. Creating a kind of hell for yourself because you\u0027re not allowed to feel human. No compassion for self or others.

In the tradition of the landmark book Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism by Ch\u00F6gyam Trungpa, Spiritual Bypassing casts a lucidly critical eye on our deeply entrenched misuse of spirituality, furthering the body of psychological/spiritual insight into how we use (and abuse) spirituality. https://www.robertmasters.com/book/spiritual-bypassing/Robert Augustus Masters: Clarifying My PastFrom 1986 to 1994 I led an experimental psychospiritual community that gradually became a cult. I called myself its guide but was more its director and centerpiece. More often than I\u2019d like to admit, I was arrogant, aggressive, and misused my power, and those in the community paid the price for this.
