      "description": "We found surprising evidence that someone has been teaching students Tibetan values and beliefs within the Former Church of THE FAMILY cult, formerly run by Anne Hamilton Byrne and her followers.\n\nAnne\u0027s religion was loosely based on Tibetan / Psuedo - Bhuddist beliefs, combined with convincing her followers that she is the re-incarnation of none other than Jesus Christ himself.\n\nBased on this, and other thing we found.....we DO NOT recommend coming here at all, for your safety.\n\nEnjoy the video, and stay safe out there!",
