      "description": "In this gripping video, we delve into the harrowing story of the \u0022Nueva Luz de Dios\u0022 cult, which brought unimaginable horror to the remote indigenous community of Alto Terr\u00F3n, Panama, in January 2020. Discover how this sect transformed from benign religious activities to ritualistic killings, resulting in the brutal deaths of seven innocent villagers, including a pregnant woman and her five children. We explore the socio-economic and cultural factors that fostered such extremism, shedding light on the conditions of isolation and neglect within the Ng\u00E4be-Bugl\u00E9 region. Join us as we uncover the tragic aftermath, the subsequent legal actions, and the ongoing fight against extremist ideologies in marginalized communities.
