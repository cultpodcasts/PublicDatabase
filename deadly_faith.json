      "description": "In this episode, we explore the controversial \u0022Twin Flames\u0022 phenomenon, a spiritual belief that suggests each soul has a perfect counterpart, known as their twin flame, with whom they must reunite for ultimate spiritual enlightenment. While proponents claim these intense, sometimes tumultuous connections lead to profound personal growth, critics argue that it can foster harmful, cult-like behavior and toxic relationships. We delve into the psychological and emotional impact of twin flame teachings and how they can lead to a dangerous blend of obsession, dependency, and manipulation.",

      "description": "In this episode we go through the life and lies of Josh Duggar. Josh is the son and oldest child of Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar and a reality TV star from TLC\u0027s show 17 Kids and Counting. Just like many other well known \u0022christian\u0022 families they tried to bury their family secrets but journalists, hackers, and investigators wouldn\u0027t let that happen. Buckle up heathens because Josh Duggar is a disgusting predator and this episode can be hard to listen to at times.
