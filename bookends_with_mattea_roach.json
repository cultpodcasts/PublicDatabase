      "description": "To be a good cult leader, you\u2019ll need some natural charisma and a pathological desire for control \u2026 and according to Rob Benvie, it might also help if you\u0027re a bit of a buffoon. Rob explores this personality mix in his latest novel, The Damagers. The book follows a 15-year-old girl named Zina in 1950s America. After a tragic event, she becomes entangled in an isolated spiritual commune ... in other words, a cult. At the centre of the story is Zina\u2019s own desire for power, which puts her in a complicated struggle with the cult\u0027s magnetic but foolish leader. This week, Rob joins Mattea Roach to talk about why cult stories resonate today and what it means to have a vision for the way we live together. Liked this conversation?
