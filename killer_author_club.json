      "description": "Cl\u00E9mence Michallon is in the Killer Author Club talking all things Our Last Resort, a haunting thriller set against the eerie isolation of a remote Utah resort. She shares her deep research into cults (and her personal connection to the Nxivm cult), how a single haunting song sparked the idea for the novel, and what it takes to psych herself up to write in a language that isn\u2019t her native tongue. This week\u2019s episode is about resilience, reinvention, and the stories we\u2019re compelled to tell.\n\nOUR LAST RESORT is a most anticipated book of the summer by The New York Times, USA Today, Oprah Daily, Boston Globe, Marie Claire, Crimereads, Apple Books, Goodreads, Brit \u002B Co, She Reads.\n\nGet a copy here: Bookshop: https://bookshop.org/a/95801/9780593802762\n\nFor schedule, merch, past episodes, and more: www.killerauthorclub.com\nJoin the FB group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/7694003734005046\nSign up for our newsletter: https://killerauthorclub.com/join-the-club\n\nNote that Bookshop.org links are affiliate links.
