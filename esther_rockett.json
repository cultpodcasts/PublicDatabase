      "description": "Esther Rockett reads the first two chapters of her memoir \u0027Universal Predator: A Lone Woman\u0027s Fight To Expose Serge Benhayon and his Universal Medicine Cult - The Inside Story\u0027.\n\nAvailable now in paperback and eBook worldwide from Amazon, Kobo, Apple Books and more. Visit https://books2read.com/universal-predator to find your preferred retailer or ask for it at your local bookstore. \n\n\u0027Universal Predator\u0027 is the incredible true story of Esther\u0027s campaign to expose Serge Benhayon, the multimillionaire leader of Universal Medicine \u2014 a female-focused \u0027esoteric healing\u0027 enterprise marketing dubious services like Esoteric Breast Massage.\n \nEsther recounts her creepy first encounters with the former tennis coach and self-styled guru that lead her to investigate and blog about his operations. Her efforts to uncover his lucrative industry of exploitation bring fierce retaliation from his fanatical followers \u2014 devotee doctors and lawyers among them \u2014 who go all out to shut her down. \n\nWhen Benhayon sues her for defamation, she struggles with scarce resources to get her defence to trial.\n\nTold in Esther\u0027s inimitably incisive style, Universal Predator is a David and Goliath tale for the internet age: a true account of one woman\u0027s battle against a patriarchal money-raking cult. A post-New Age MeToo story, it\u0027s also a riveting courtroom drama. \n\nNo one can predict what will happen when the slippery manipulator enters the witness box in the Supreme Court of New South Wales and faces questions from Esther\u2019s veteran criminal and defamation lawyer Tom Molomby SC.",

She discusses the way that the cult underhandedly infiltrated the health sector, community organizations, workplaces, and educational establishments, and caused tension and distrust among local residents. She gives some guidelines on the way forward, a management plan for locals that minimizes harm to all involved, and options for legal remedies.\n\n*** Suggested plan for local committees dealing with Universal Medicine ***\n* Understand UM in general\n* Gather information on local UM identities\n* Monitor UM activities in the area\n     - events related to UM and its promoters,\n     - UM identities participating in community organisations, schools etc.\n* Use notification template to notify stakeholders and request that\n     - nothing UM related is to be promoted within the organisation in question\n     - UM identities make full disclosure of their links to UM and whenever they promote,             endorse or introduce anything or anyone UM related to the organisation.\n* Liaise with media to keep UM under scrutiny\n* Liaise with public representatives. Ask them what action they propose to take to protect  the community from UM\u0027s anti-social behaviours\n\nFor more info or to ask questions go to Esther\u0027s blog (copy and paste into your browser): https://universalmedicineaccountability.wordpress.com/2019/03/27/universal-medicine-cult-in-the-nsw-northern-rivers/",
