With its sights set less on saving lives and more on cashing in and accumulating guns, the formerly sterling reputation of Synanon began to tarnish. As soon as they began acting on their violent threats, the thin thread holding the whole group together frayed into oblivion.

They caught the eye of a journalist on TikTok reporting on cults, but once the group went viral, unsavory details about its leaders\u0027 past emerged. The group tried hiding its online activity, but some residents say the so-called doomsday cult has not stopped its pursuit of the small town.

When he and the rest of the UFOlogy cult take up residence in a Texas suburb, decked out in all white and cowboy hats, officials fear they may have a Heaven\u0027s Gate situation on their hands. Will it end as badly as everyone thinks, or will Hon-Ming Chen turn out to be just another false prophet? Support Sinisterhood",
