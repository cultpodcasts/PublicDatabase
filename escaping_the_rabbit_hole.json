      "description": "Episode Summary In this epsiode, my guest and I talk about her life in a religious cult. As well how she managed to escape. Quotes We Loved The Power of Self-Belief: \u201CThe thing or the, what\u2019s wrong in society is that are believing the lie that they\u2019re not enough.\u201D\u2014 Chantelle Neufeld [00:04:29 \u2192 00:04:36] Reprogramming Beliefs and Shifting Mindset: \u201CI just did it a little bit at a time\u2026When I started on that path to recognize it, and then shift to the path of what I wanted to see, what I wanted to feel, what I wanted to experience, what I wanted to create.\u201D\u2014 Chantelle Neufeld [00:21:43 \u2192 00:21:52] The Power of Personal Choice: \u201CWe\u2019re no better than the brainwashing people in cults if we\u2019re just trying to brainwash everybody into thinking our opinion is right and theirs is wrong.\u201D\u2014 Chantelle Neufeld [00:26:45 \u2192 00:27:51] Perfectionism and Social Anxiety: \u201CThe number one thing that\u2019s the problem with most cult survivors is actually social anxiety. The root of that is also feeling not enough.\u201D\u2014 Chantelle Neufeld [00:31:18 \u2192 00:31:25] The Power of Deep Breaths: \u201CThe deep breaths, I think, is across board, everybody can agree that that\u2019s a good thing because it\u2019s so easy to do, and it\u2019s easy to remember, and once you\u2019ve taken those deep breaths, you\u2019re settling into your own kinda trance where you can recognize when there\u2019s a thought or feeling that isn\u2019t being helpful to you and you can pivot towards your preferences and be like, I prefer this instead. Right?\u201D\u2014 Chantelle Neufeld [00:39:46 \u2192 00:40:10] The Power of Attention: \u201Cwe really need to realize that attention is, like, our highest currency, but that we have always a choice to direct our focus to what we want.\u201D\u2014 Chantelle Neufeld [00:46:02 \u2192 00:46:09] Guest Bio \u0026 Links https://www.chantellen.com/ Chantelle\u2019s Facebook Page Chantelle\u2019s Instagram page",
