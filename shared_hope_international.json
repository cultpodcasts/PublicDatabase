      "description": "In this deeply moving episode of Invading the Darkness, Lacey shares her experience navigating the legal system as a trafficking survivor\u2014and the lasting impact it had on her healing. From being retraumatized by the very systems meant to protect her, to becoming an advocate for change, Lacey sheds light on the urgent need for trauma-informed, survivor-centered support in every step of the justice process.\n\nHer story is a powerful reminder that justice must do more than prosecute\u2014it must protect, restore, and truly see the person behind the case.\n\nYou can help make the legal system more survivor-centered and trauma informed!
