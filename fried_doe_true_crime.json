      "description": "In the 1970s, a wave of cults gained popularity, and an alarming number of people began mysteriously disappearing. Enter Ted Patrick, the controversial figure dubbed the \u0022father of deprogramming.\u0022 In this episode, I unravel the gripping story of how Patrick took matters into his own hands, employing forceful deprogramming methods to rescue individuals entangled in the clutches of these elusive groups. Join me as I explore the tumultuous landscape of the 1970s cult phenomenon, where ideology clashed with personal freedom, and the line between liberation and infringement blurred.
