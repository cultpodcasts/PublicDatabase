      "description": "In part two of this wild 2-part convo, Liat chats with comedian and cult survivor Davey Jackson. In this second half, things get even deeper\u2014and somehow even funnier. Davey opens up about the psychological fallout of leaving a cult, the behavioral patterns that kept him stuck, and how comedy became his unexpected lifeline. Liat and Davey break down cult dynamics through a behavioral lens, sprinkle in some serious shade, and prove that healing doesn\u2019t have to be humorless. Don\u2019t miss this final dose of insight, laughter, and truth bombs.
