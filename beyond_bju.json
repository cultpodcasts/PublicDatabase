Drawing from Brene\u2019 Brown\u0027s book \u0027Atlas of the Heart\u0027 and insights from Dr. Ramini, I explore the profound impact of betrayal from trusted individuals and institutions. I discuss the symptoms and emotional toll of betrayal, including feelings of depression, anxiety, and shame. I highlight the specific betrayal experienced within high-control religious environments and abusive familial settings and reference the institutional betrayal exemplified by the cover-up culture at Bob Jones University, as detailed in the Grace Report. I emphasize the devastating consequences of these betrayals and share insights on healing.

Amanda shares her journey from growing up in a conservative Baptist community to her experiences at BJU as a resident assistant (RA), eventually transitioning into her role as a dorm counselor. She provides a rare glimpse into the stringent and invasive regulations enforced by the university, including the handling of self-harm, suicide, abuse, and LGBTQ\u002B students. Amanda discusses the limited training and tools available for counseling students and the pervasive culture of enforcement rather than empathy. She also reflects on her personal journey of accepting her sexuality after leaving BJU and offers support and advice for current students grappling with similar issues. This episode sheds light on the restrictive and often harmful environment within BJU and emphasizes the importance of finding freedom and authenticity beyond such institutions.\n\nAndrew\u0027s Links \nJOIN MY PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/4ndrewpledger \nFacebook Discussion Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1153866318625322/ \nMy Substack: https://speakingupandrewpledger.substack.com/ \nLinktree: https://andrewpledger.mypixieset.com/links\n -Music: https://www.purple-planet.com \n*Some audio is regenerated by AI because of mispronunciations and/or recording issues\u00A0\n\n Hosted on Acast.

She was forced to attend BJU in 2008, right after the death of her best friend.

Unaware of her autism at the time, Daisy grappled with academic struggles and navigating the toxic culture of BJU. She was subjected to bullying, scrutiny, and sexual harassment due to her body size.

I share my own experiences of being raised within the Independent Fundamental Baptist movement, highlighting the profound influence of indoctrination on identity formation, decision-making, and critical thinking processes.

      "description": "Leah Worley\u2019s time at BJU was marked by an invasive surveillance regime and a suffocating culture of authoritarianism. Targeted for her appearance, she found herself under constant scrutiny, with every aspect of her identity dissected and judged under the unforgiving lens of the university\u0027s rigid moral compass. Leah recounts chilling episodes of being stalked, publicly shamed, sexually harassed, and subjected to relentless intimidation by authority figures determined to break her down. Yet, amidst this turmoil, Leah\u2019s narrative is also one of awakening and empowerment. She describes the turning point when she decided to take control of her life, employing strategies to evade undue surveillance and reclaim her autonomy. This episode is a rallying cry for all those who have felt the weight of coercive control, a testament to the power of personal agency, and a reminder that even in the face of adversity, hope and renewal are possible.

      "description": "In this episode, we delve into the experiences of Joshua Bellis, whose family was intricately entwined with Bob Jones University (BJU). He shares his experiences of growing up as a missionary kid in Canada. His parents were missionaries with the Gospel Fellowship Association, a mission agency operated by BJU. Joshua also shares the story of his grandfather (James Bellis) who, despite his dedicated service to BJU, was neglected in his time of need, leading to a serious injury. Shockingly, it took a lawsuit threat for the institution to take responsibility. He also recounts a disturbing incident involving his uncle, a high-ranking BJU member, and the university\u0027s mishandling of a scandal, revealing the institution\u0027s prioritization of image over moral responsibility. Finally, Joshua opens up about his father\u0027s fall from leadership. Join us as we explore these stories of betrayal, disillusionment, and the struggle for justice.

In this updated episode, I add some of the recommendations section. The GRACE report is a 301-page report on the mishandling of sex abuse allegations at Bob Jones University. The report shows Bob Jones University responding to rape and abuse claims with woeful ignorance of state law, a near-complete lack of training in psychology and trauma counseling best practices, and an overarching campus culture that blames women and girls for any abuse they suffer, and which paints all sexuality-from rape to consensual sex-as equivalent misdeeds.

Listen to the IndoctriNation Podcast on Apple Podcasts , Spotify , and other platforms . Andrew Pledger is a content creator, activist, and writer who uses social media to share his story and inspire others. He is a religious trauma survivor who was homeschooled K-12 and raised in a fundamentalist Christian cult (Independent Fundamental Baptist movement). He brings awareness to spiritual and religious abuse. Being a part of the LGBTQ\u0026#43; community and experiencing religious trauma has inspired him to pursue psychology to help survivors. After being homeschooled, he found his way to Bob Jones University. He attended the fundamentalist Christian college for over three years until he was expelled in his last semester for sharing his story and denouncing fundamentalist teachings. Andrew comes on the show to share his experiences of the level of control and mental abuse he experienced at Bob Jones University. Andrew opens up to Rachel about his complicated relationship with his 2nd generation IFB parents, he compares the high-control culture he grew up within his family with the complete authoritarian control of Bob Jones University. Together Andrew and Rachel discuss the psychological impacts on adolescents living under the constant surveillance and harsh judgment of fundamentalism.

She joined the faculty at BJU and completed her Ph.D. from Indiana University. In 2007, she left BJU after being given an ultimatum: either resign or permit the BJU daycare to spank her 2-year-old son. She chose her son. In this episode, she provides an overview of the history of Bob Jones University. She is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication Studies at Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina. She holds a Ph.D. from Indiana University in Rhetorical Studies with a minor in American Studies. Her book, \u0027 Romancing the Difference: Kenneth Burke, Bob Jones University, and the Rhetoric of Religious Fundamentalism \u0027, was a scholarly attempt to stretch the boundaries of both Kenneth Burke\u2019s rhetorical theory on tragedy and comedy as well as stretch conservative evangelical\u2019s separatist frames. Her second book, \u0027 White Nationalism and Faith: Statements and Counter-Statements \u0027, tracks the religious arguments for and against white nationalism in America since the Civil War.

      "description": "Dr. Camille Lewis attended BJU in the 90s, where she earned both her bachelor\u0027s and master\u0027s degrees. She joined the faculty at BJU and completed her Ph.D. from Indiana University. In 2007, she left the school after being given an ultimatum: either resign or permit the BJU daycare to spank her 2-year-old son. She chose her son. In this episode, she provides an overview of the history of Bob Jones University.\nShe is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication Studies at Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina. She holds a Ph.D. from Indiana University in Rhetorical Studies with a minor in American Studies. Her book, \u0027Romancing the Difference: Kenneth Burke, Bob Jones University, and the Rhetoric of Religious Fundamentalism\u0027, was a scholarly attempt to stretch the boundaries of both Kenneth Burke\u2019s rhetorical theory on tragedy and comedy as well as stretch conservative evangelical\u2019s separatist frames. Her second book, \u0027White Nationalism and Faith: Statements and Counter-Statements\u0027, tracks the religious arguments for and against white nationalism in America since the Civil War. She is currently working on a manuscript entitled Klandamentalism. After nearly twenty years in the classroom, Camille is thrilled to be teaching Rhetoric \u0026 Strategy, Argumentation, Rhetorical Criticism, Great Speeches, and Public Speaking at Furman.
