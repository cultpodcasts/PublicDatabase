Amanda shares her journey from growing up in a conservative Baptist community to her experiences at BJU as a resident assistant (RA), eventually transitioning into her role as a dorm counselor. She provides a rare glimpse into the stringent and invasive regulations enforced by the university, including the handling of self-harm, suicide, abuse, and LGBTQ\u002B students. Amanda discusses the limited training and tools available for counseling students and the pervasive culture of enforcement rather than empathy. She also reflects on her personal journey of accepting her sexuality after leaving BJU and offers support and advice for current students grappling with similar issues. This episode sheds light on the restrictive and often harmful environment within BJU and emphasizes the importance of finding freedom and authenticity beyond such institutions.\n\nAndrew\u0027s Links \nJOIN MY PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/4ndrewpledger \nFacebook Discussion Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1153866318625322/ \nMy Substack: https://speakingupandrewpledger.substack.com/ \nLinktree: https://andrewpledger.mypixieset.com/links\n -Music: https://www.purple-planet.com \n*Some audio is regenerated by AI because of mispronunciations and/or recording issues\u00A0\n\n Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "Today, we\u0027re joined by Dan Parsons, a former student and staff of Bob Jones University. Before BJU he attended North Love Baptist Church. A church with its own scandals. This church also started the Christian IFB addiction program called Reformers Unanimous (RU). I highly recommend listening to the Preacher Boys Podcast as he covers this church extensively. (scroll to the bottom for links) In this episode, Dan offers us a intimate look into his experiences within these high-control religious environments. He recounts the extreme, fear-based tactics used to ensure compliance and conversion, including a shocking staged event at North Love Baptist Church. Dan also discusses the challenges he faced while working at Bob Jones University, revealing the authoritarian culture that permeated the institution and deeply affected his professional and personal life. He also shares a tragic story involving his daughter at a SBC church. Join us as we explore these critical themes, aiming to understand better the profound impact of fundamentalist indoctrination and the path towards recovery.

Targeted for her appearance, she found herself under constant scrutiny, with every aspect of her identity dissected and judged under the unforgiving lens of the university\u0027s rigid moral compass. Leah recounts chilling episodes of being stalked, publicly shamed, sexually harassed, and subjected to relentless intimidation by authority figures determined to break her down. Yet, amidst this turmoil, Leah\u2019s narrative is also one of awakening and empowerment. She describes the turning point when she decided to take control of her life, employing strategies to evade undue surveillance and reclaim her autonomy. This episode is a rallying cry for all those who have felt the weight of coercive control, a testament to the power of personal agency, and a reminder that even in the face of adversity, hope and renewal are possible.

He shares his experiences of growing up as a missionary kid in Canada. His parents were missionaries with the Gospel Fellowship Association, a mission agency operated by BJU. Joshua also shares the story of his grandfather (James Bellis) who, despite his dedicated service to BJU, was neglected in his time of need, leading to a serious injury. Shockingly, it took a lawsuit threat for the institution to take responsibility. He also recounts a disturbing incident involving his uncle, a high-ranking BJU member, and the university\u0027s mishandling of a scandal, revealing the institution\u0027s prioritization of image over moral responsibility. Finally, Joshua opens up about his father\u0027s fall from leadership. Join us as we explore these stories of betrayal, disillusionment, and the struggle for justice.

In this updated episode, I add some of the recommendations section. The GRACE report is a 301-page report on the mishandling of sex abuse allegations at Bob Jones University. The report shows Bob Jones University responding to rape and abuse claims with woeful ignorance of state law, a near-complete lack of training in psychology and trauma counseling best practices, and an overarching campus culture that blames women and girls for any abuse they suffer, and which paints all sexuality-from rape to consensual sex-as equivalent misdeeds.

After being homeschooled, he found his way to Bob Jones University. He attended the fundamentalist Christian college for over three years until he was expelled in his last semester for sharing his story and denouncing fundamentalist teachings. Andrew comes on the show to share his experiences of the level of control and mental abuse he experienced at Bob Jones University.

      "description": "Dr. Camille Lewis attended BJU in the 90s, where she earned both her bachelor\u0027s and master\u0027s degrees. She joined the faculty at BJU and completed her Ph.D. from Indiana University. In 2007, she left BJU after being given an ultimatum: either resign or permit the BJU daycare to spank her 2-year-old son. She chose her son. In this episode, she provides an overview of the history of Bob Jones University. She is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication Studies at Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina. She holds a Ph.D. from Indiana University in Rhetorical Studies with a minor in American Studies. Her book, \u0027 Romancing the Difference: Kenneth Burke, Bob Jones University, and the Rhetoric of Religious Fundamentalism \u0027, was a scholarly attempt to stretch the boundaries of both Kenneth Burke\u2019s rhetorical theory on tragedy and comedy as well as stretch conservative evangelical\u2019s separatist frames. Her second book, \u0027 White Nationalism and Faith: Statements and Counter-Statements \u0027, tracks the religious arguments for and against white nationalism in America since the Civil War. She is currently working on a manuscript entitled Klandamentalism. After nearly twenty years in the classroom, Camille is thrilled to be teaching Rhetoric \u0026 Strategy, Argumentation, Rhetorical Criticism, Great Speeches, and Public Speaking at Furman.
