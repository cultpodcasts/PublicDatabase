      "description": "After the end of Joseph Smith, Brigham Young led the Latter-day Saints west to the remote Utah Territory, but the move wasn\u2019t just geographical. In this video, we dive deep into the surprising doctrinal changes and theological shifts introduced by Brigham Young that reshaped Mormonism as we know it.\n\nFrom Adam-God theory, The Law of Adoption, and increased emphasis on plural marriage, to the creation of a theocratic system in the Utah desert, this video explores how the LDS Church began to diverge from its original teachings...and why.\n\nWe\u2019ll also examine how the rapidly changing world of the 19th century, from American expansionism to the discovery of gold in California, pushed the Mormons toward deeper isolationism, cultural preservation, and religious fundamentalism.\n\nIf you\u0027re interested in Mormon history, religious evolution, or the ways that belief systems adapt under pressure, this video is for you.\n\n\uD83D\uDC49 Don\u2019t forget to like, subscribe, and share if you want more deep dives into Mormon doctrine, American religious history, and untold stories of faith in flux.\n#mormonhistory  #brighamyoung  #ldschurch  #exmormon  #churchhistory  #polygamy #doctrinalshift #hiddenhistory  #americanreligion #utahhistory  #19thcenturyamerica  #faithvsculture \n\nShow Notes:\nBrigham Young\u2019s sermon the Adam-God Doctrine\n\u200B\u200B Journal of Discourses. 1:50-51; Friday, April 9, 1852; Sermon delivered by President Brigham Young in the Salt Lake Tabernacle, SLC, Utah.\nhttps://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/digital/collection/JournalOfDiscourses3/id/1861/\nHeber C.

      "description": "In this eye-opening episode, we uncover the long-suppressed story of Sarah Pratt, the wife of early LDS apostle Orson Pratt, and the explosive scandal that shook the foundations of Nauvoo in the 1840s. While Orson was away on a mission, Sarah found herself entangled in a bitter power struggle between Joseph Smith, the founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and John C. Bennett, a former ally turned outspoken critic of Smith. Accused of infidelity, Sarah became the target of vicious rumors, claims she always denied. But was she a victim of a smear campaign? And what role did early polygamy and shifting power dynamics play in what happened to her? As Orson returned and ultimately accepted polygamy, rising within the church hierarchy, Sarah\u2019s story faded into silence. Now, for the first time, we bring her narrative to light, revealing a complex, human story of loyalty, betrayal, and the hidden costs of religious authority. \u0026#x1f514; Subscribe for more forgotten stories from Mormon history and beyond. \u0026#x1f44d; Like and comment if you want to see more videos exploring the lives of early Latter-day Saint women. #MormonHistory #SarahPratt #JosephSmith #OrsonPratt #JohnCBennett #LDSChurch #Polygamy #UntoldStories #NauvooScandal",

We talk about the backlash, the public response, and why packaging polygamy for kids is such a complicated and charged endeavor.\n\nNote: Since recording this episode, the children\u2019s book has been edited due to the significant backlash it received.

      "description": "We decided to do this podcast together to have an open discussion from two different viewpoints. Last week, Kensley told some of her experience and her story of choosing to stay in the LDS Church and looking into Church History and particularly the history of polygamy. A lot of people asked to hear Joslyn\u0027s story who is no longer in the Church. In this episode, we talk about our upbringing, her experiences, what a faith transition can do to your life, and why it\u0027s important to have these kind of conversations with people from different perspectives.",

      "description": "Welcome to the first episode of our podcast Sisters Not Wives where we are looking at the history of Mormon polygamy from a female lens. This topic that has always been controversial and hence silenced and suppressed in the past and today. We\u0027re two sisters openly discussing the history of polygamy in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, also known as Mormon polygamy; what actually happened and how it still is impacting our beliefs, culture, and lives.\n\nPolygamy is generally either dismissed as irrelevant because the LDS church doesn\u0027t actively practice it today or it\u0027s quickly explained away using logical fallacies or claims to authority. Yet, issues such as divorce, celestial marriage, gender inequality, obedience, motherhood, fatherhood, loneliness, and many more are topics that are more relevant than ever in our day and all have roots in polygamy. So let\u0027s talk about it...",
