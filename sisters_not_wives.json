      "description": "The Mountain Meadows Massacre is one of the darkest and most disturbing events in Utah history and the truth is far more twisted than what most people have seen on screen.\n\nIn this episode, we break down where Netflix\u2019s American Primeval gets the story wrong, why its portrayal of frontier violence oversimplifies what really happened, and how last year\u2019s best-selling book None Left to Tell comes closer to capturing the emotional and human reality behind the massacre.\n\nWe walk through the actual historical events that led to the 1857 slaughter of the Baker-Fancher wagon train in southern Utah: the growing paranoia of the Utah War, the role of local Mormon militia members, the deception under a white flag of truce, and the brutal execution of men, women, and children. We also explore how the massacre was deliberately covered up for decades, with blame shifted away from those responsible and the truth buried in official narratives.\n\nFrom Hollywood dramatization to historical fiction to documented fact, this episode explores how fear, loyalty, and power converged to produce one of the most horrific massacres in Utah history.\n\nShow Notes:\nModern Scholarly Works\nWalker, Ronald W., Richard E.

      "description": "In November 2025, the LDS Church\u2019s Sunday School lesson on polygamy and Doctrine \u0026 Covenants Section 132 raised more questions than answers and for many, confirmed long-standing concerns about how the Church handles its own history.\nIn this episode of Sisters Not Wives, we break down what actually happened in that lesson and why it felt less like transparency and more like carefully managed silence.\nWe talk about:\n-\u00A0 How the lesson skirted around the truth of LDS polygamy\n- Why absolute obedience was emphasized instead of historical context\n- The fear Church leaders seem to have around open discussion\n- The deeply troubling parts of Section 132 that remain canonized today\n- Consent loopholes, biblical justifications built on logical fallacies, and sexist rules that harmed everyone\n- How \u201Cpretend transparency\u201D keeps members compliant but uninformed\nSection 132 isn\u2019t just a relic of the past. It\u2019s still scripture. And when you actually read it, the implications are unsettling.\nThis episode isn\u2019t about attacking faith. It\u2019s about telling the truth, asking better questions, and refusing to let institutional discomfort rewrite lived history.\n\uD83C\uDF99\uFE0F Subscribe for more honest conversations about Mormonism, polygamy, faith deconstruction and construction, and religious accountability.",

      "description": "Today, we\u0027re exploring how a rising climate of religious fervor, growing suspicion, and a sense of impending doom shaped life in Utah Territory during the 1850s. As tensions escalated between Latter-day Saint settlers and outsiders, the community braced for what many believed would be another invasion, this time from the United States government during the brewing Utah (Mormon) War.\n\nWe also look closely at the murder of Apostle Parley P. Pratt, a flashpoint that intensified fear, anger, and hostility across the region. These overlapping pressures\u2014spiritual, political, and personal\u2014created a volatile environment that ultimately contributed to the tragic events at Mountain Meadows in 1857.\n\nJoin us as we unpack the complicated, often overlooked factors that led to this pivotal moment in Western and Mormon history.",

In a time of famine, natural disasters, and desperation, many early Saints believed that shedding blood could restore their purity before God, a terrifying example of how faith and fanaticism can collide.\n\nJoin us as we dive into the untold history of how spiritual panic, charismatic leadership, and apocalyptic thinking led ordinary people to justify the unthinkable all in the name of redemption.\n\n#MormonHistory #BloodAtonement #LDSChurch #ExMormon #Mormon #ReligiousExtremism #MormonReformation #AmericanHistory #CultDocumentary #FaithAndFear #DarkHistory",

From exploring the origins of temple practices to confronting the pressures of worthiness interviews and modesty rules, this conversation opens space for honesty, healing, and hope.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about tearing down faith; it\u2019s about understanding it. We talk candidly about what\u2019s beautiful in the culture, what\u2019s painful, and what needs to change so that future generations can experience more authentic connection, compassion, and spiritual freedom within or outside of Mormonism.\n\nJoin the conversation, share your thoughts, and let\u2019s take the taboo out of talking about what really matters.\n\n#MormonCulture #LDSChurch #FaithJourney #ExMormon #MormonWomen #TempleCulture #EternalMarriage #FaithDiscussion #Deconstruction #SpiritualHealing #ReligiousTrauma #MormonPodcast #WomenOfFaith #HonestConversations #MormonStories #HealingFromReligion",

In this video, we dive deep into the surprising doctrinal changes and theological shifts introduced by Brigham Young that reshaped Mormonism as we know it.\n\nFrom Adam-God theory, The Law of Adoption, and increased emphasis on plural marriage, to the creation of a theocratic system in the Utah desert, this video explores how the LDS Church began to diverge from its original teachings...and why.\n\nWe\u2019ll also examine how the rapidly changing world of the 19th century, from American expansionism to the discovery of gold in California, pushed the Mormons toward deeper isolationism, cultural preservation, and religious fundamentalism.\n\nIf you\u0027re interested in Mormon history, religious evolution, or the ways that belief systems adapt under pressure, this video is for you.\n\n\uD83D\uDC49 Don\u2019t forget to like, subscribe, and share if you want more deep dives into Mormon doctrine, American religious history, and untold stories of faith in flux.\n#mormonhistory  #brighamyoung  #ldschurch  #exmormon  #churchhistory  #polygamy #doctrinalshift #hiddenhistory  #americanreligion #utahhistory  #19thcenturyamerica  #faithvsculture \n\nShow Notes:\nBrigham Young\u2019s sermon the Adam-God Doctrine\n\u200B\u200B Journal of Discourses. 1:50-51; Friday, April 9, 1852; Sermon delivered by President Brigham Young in the Salt Lake Tabernacle, SLC, Utah.\nhttps://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/digital/collection/JournalOfDiscourses3/id/1861/\nHeber C.

We dig into the historical records, analyze the scripture itself, and expose the efforts to rewrite church history to justify the rise of polygamy.

      "description": "In this eye-opening episode, we uncover the long-suppressed story of Sarah Pratt, the wife of early LDS apostle Orson Pratt, and the explosive scandal that shook the foundations of Nauvoo in the 1840s. While Orson was away on a mission, Sarah found herself entangled in a bitter power struggle between Joseph Smith, the founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and John C. Bennett, a former ally turned outspoken critic of Smith. Accused of infidelity, Sarah became the target of vicious rumors, claims she always denied. But was she a victim of a smear campaign? And what role did early polygamy and shifting power dynamics play in what happened to her? As Orson returned and ultimately accepted polygamy, rising within the church hierarchy, Sarah\u2019s story faded into silence. Now, for the first time, we bring her narrative to light, revealing a complex, human story of loyalty, betrayal, and the hidden costs of religious authority. \u0026#x1f514; Subscribe for more forgotten stories from Mormon history and beyond. \u0026#x1f44d; Like and comment if you want to see more videos exploring the lives of early Latter-day Saint women. #MormonHistory #SarahPratt #JosephSmith #OrsonPratt #JohnCBennett #LDSChurch #Polygamy #UntoldStories #NauvooScandal",

In this episode, we dive deep into the little-known story of a cult-like religious group in early 19th-century Maine whose beliefs would profoundly shape early Mormon doctrine. Learn how eight of the twelve LDS apostles, sent as missionaries to England, encountered this group and then how their experiences helped influence the rise of polygamy in the church. Want to hear about Brigham Young\u0027s hot boy summer in Manchester and William Clayton\u0027s tell-all journals that look more like Love Island than missionary work? We gotchu.",

From his political maneuvering to his secret spiritual wifery and eventual excommunication, Bennett\u2019s story is a critical piece in understanding the backdrop of early Mormon polygamy.\n\nThen we fast forward to 2025, where a children\u0027s storybook about plural marriage recently made waves for its problematic moral lessons and highly sanitized take on one of the most fraught elements of church history. We talk about the backlash, the public response, and why packaging polygamy for kids is such a complicated and charged endeavor.\n\nNote: Since recording this episode, the children\u2019s book has been edited due to the significant backlash it received.
