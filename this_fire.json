Its time to learn the RIGHT and WRONG way to beat yourself up, as this month we take a look at the February 1989 episode of Fire By Nite: \u201CWhy Feel Guilt?\u201D Youth groups often get accused of breaking kids down, demolishing their self esteem, so that they can be built back up in the image of God (or\u2026maybe just the image of whichever church they were at\u2019s youth pastor). But here, Blaine and crew let us know that it\u2019s not all self flagellation and internalized hatred. Sometimes kids? Things aren\u2019t your fault\u2026except when they are\u2026but sometimes they aren\u2019t! I dunno, it\u2019s all a bit murky. At least we\u2019ve got the dulcet tones of CCM rocker girl Margaret Becker to look forward to! \u2014\u2014\u2014 This Fire is taking an in depth look at Fire By Nite - a Christian teen variety show produced at the height of the 1980s Satanic Panic.

While Fire By Nite was serving up the Satanic panic to teens already in the fold, we discover what the panic looked like to a mainstream audience, broadcast in PRIMETIME on NBC. Folks - this special was seen in the homes of over 19 million Americans when it broadcast. So if all of a sudden your otherwise secular parents took away your heavy metal music and D\u0026D monster manuals in late 1988? There\u2019s a pretty good shot this special was the reason why!",

Well, if you\u2019re interested - Steve and Alec may have discovered just such a thing, as the bros. sit down and watch the April 1988 episode of Fire By Nite, titled \u201CIf God is For You (Who Can Be Against You?)\u201D. You\u2019ll see that with the power of God, you\u2019ve already attained victory over any trials and tribulations that may come into your life. All you have to do is claim it!!\u2026\u2026oh, and by the way, while you\u2019re enjoying that tick mark in the W column\u2026God (via Blaine and crew) do have a favor to ask...if its at all possible, do you think you could you work on convincing your representatives in Washington to push for a constitutional amendment to force prayer into public schools? It would be really cool if you did\u2026pleeeeease? That\u2019s right! Its The Law of Attraction meets Christian Nationalism, on this very exciting episode of THIS FIRE!",

They take in the sights, ride some roller coasters, go to seminars, and try to get perspective into just what\u2019s happening in the CCM world today. Does Alec (a neophyte to the evangelical world) feel like a fish out of water? Does the festival live up to Steve\u2019s childhood nostalgia?

With the help of Blaine and crew we\u2019ve gained a whole new perspective on how to demonstrate commitment. With great strategies like: Pray more. And \u201Csubmit totally\u201D to your master. And \u201Cbe a prisoner of Jesus\u201D (no really, that\u2019s a real quote from the episode).

      "description": "We\u2019re back, and ready to PUMP. YOU. UP. With \u201CThe Power of Faith\u201D! On today\u2019s episode of This Fire, Steve and Alec take a look at Fire By Nite\u2019s manual for harnessing the power of prayer for fitness and fortune. With strong enough faith, you TOO can defeat debilitating illness, have stolen property returned to you, and learn to manifest miracles with ease. We also visit with evangelical bodybuilder John Jacobs and The Power Team, as we start to slide headlong into the satanic panic proper, and learn that even with all the evil and suffering in the world, God will always be there to help you break out of a pair of handcuffs to impress an arena of slack jawed onlookers. Oh, and before we forget! Feel free to stop by our new official website acquirethisfire.com, where you can download the show and drop us a line and give us YOUR thoughts on today\u2019s epsiode. Do you have memories of watching Fire By Nite as a kid? Did you grow up during the satanic panic? Do you have scathing criticisms of our podcast format? We would love to hear from you! #thisFire #fireByNite #rockandroll #truth #evangelical #christianity #jesus #christian #comedy #podcast #sketch #church #youthGroup #80s #90s #nostalgia #ccm #music #satanism #crunchylightbulb #bodyBuilding #powerTeam #johnJacobs",

Plus, did we mention skiing?! Because on this week\u0027s episode the FBN crew, and special musical guest Russ Taff, take over beautiful Winter Park Colorado for Youth Express \u002787! Which absolutely, positively in no way was just an excuse to shoot at a location where Blaine could get his downhill jam on!

But did you know that if you\u2019re not careful, those sick solos and drum fills can take over, and lead you down a path of degeneracy and Godlessness? On today\u2019s episode of This Fire, punk out with Steve and Alec as they trip the light fantastic and sample some of the \u201Cheaviest\u201D Christian rock 1987 had to offer. Find out what Fire By Night had to say about the influence rock (and or) roll had over America\u2019s youth, and stick around for the dulcet tones of one Mr. Mylon LeFevre and Broken Heart. We promise this episode does not go off the rails, and 100% guaranteed delivers the TRUTH about Rock and Roll.",

Spoiler alert, your depression MAY be caused by direct influence from the Prince of Darkness\u2122\uFE0F himself. Big yikes! But it\u2019s not all bad news, we also sample the musical stylings of preeminent Christian rock band Petra, and even a music video from a little known artist, one Ms. Amy Grant.
