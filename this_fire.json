Nope, today she\u2019s detailing grizzly murders, baby sacrifice, generational Satanists, and the psychologists just trying to make sense of it all.

You are an alien ambassador sent by President Jesus to reach out to the people of Earthrealm, and offer them eternal life. All you need to do is prepare for the return of the comet Hale-Bopp and\u2026..wait, sorry, wrong video for that last one.

With the dulcet tones of KLOVE all over the Billboard Hot 100, Steve and Alec are here to make sense of it all and figure out why all of a sudden mainstream audiences are so enthusiastically embracing the not quite country, not quite hip-hop, not quite pop m\u00E9lange that has become a staple of Christian contemporary music over the past decade. PLUS, we take a look back at our This Fire mixtape in progress, and compare the Fire By Nite featured CCM hits of the 80s, to what\u2019s going on in the scene today. Which era comes out on top?
