Lieu asked if there were any underage girls at that party or at any party that Trump attended with Epstein.\n\n\u201CThere is no evidence that Donald Trump has committed a crime,\u201D Bondi said.\n\nLieu then accused Bondi of lying under oath. He referred to a statement given to the FBI\u2019s threat operation station, in which a witness claimed he met a girl who said she was raped by Trump and Epstein. Lieu said the DOJ hasn\u2019t interviewed this witness.\n\n\u201CYou have not held a single man accountable. Shame on you,\u201D Lieu said. \u201CIf you had any decency, you would resign right after this hearing concludes.\u201D\n\nBondi responded by saying Lieu doesn\u2019t want to talk about the crime perpetrated by undocumented immigrants in his state of California.\n\nThe Department of Justice has released millions of pages of Epstein-related documents, photographs and messages.

      "description": "Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., questioned Attorney General Pam Bondi in an oversight hearing Wednesday.\n\nJayapal pressed Bondi on how the administration has handled the Epstein files. She addressed survivors seated behind Bondi in the hearing room, saying, \u0022if you are willing, please raise your hands if you have still not been able to meet with this Department of Justice.\u0022\n\nShe noted that every survivor present raised their hand.\n\nThe hearing offered an opportunity for lawmakers to question Bondi on a number of controversial issues involving the Justice Department, including around the Trump administration\u2019s failure to meet a Congress-mandated deadline to release all of its Epstein files; the legal justification for the administration\u2019s capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00E1s Maduro and strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific; as well as prosecutions of perceived Trump political rivals like James Comey and Letitia James. Bondi is seeking to revive both cases, which were already thrown out by a U.S. district judge.\n\nThe Department of Justice has released millions of pages of Epstein-related documents, photographs and messages. But it missed its deadline by more than a month, and the releases have been mired by missed redactions and accusations of key omissions. Millions of pages related to the investigation into the late convicted sex offender remain inaccessible, though the White House defends its review as thorough and complete.
