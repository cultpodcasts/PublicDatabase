      "description": "This video explores the shocking case of the so-called *Birmingham Bathing Cult*, led by self-proclaimed pastor Michael Oluronbi.  \n\nFor decades, Oluronbi manipulated children and families through a ritual he called the \u201Choly bath,\u201D convincing followers it was a spiritual cleansing. Behind this fa\u00E7ade, he carried out repeated sexual abuse, leaving victims traumatised and silenced by fear, superstition, and control.  \n\nBetween the 1980s and 2018, Oluronbi\u2019s crimes included grooming, rape, and forced abortions to cover up pregnancies caused by his abuse. His wife, Juliana, was later convicted for aiding him. In 2020, Oluronbi was sentenced to 34 years in prison, while Juliana received 11 years.  \n\nThis disturbing story highlights how faith and trust can be twisted into tools of exploitation, and why safeguarding against abuse within religious communities is essential.  \n\n\u2696\uFE0F Sources include BBC News, Sky News, ITV, and court reports.  \n\nLink to website here\nhttps://empresssparkle.co.uk/\n\n#BirminghamBathingCult\n#MichaelOluronbi\n#TrueCrimeUK\n#CultExposed\n#FaithAbuse\n#TrueCrimeDocumentary\n#SurvivorStories\n#CrimeHistory\n#JusticeServed\n#ProtectChildren",
