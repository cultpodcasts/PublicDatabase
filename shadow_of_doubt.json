      "description": "The Australian\u2019s investigative podcast Shadow of Doubt in 2023 raised serious doubts over the convictions of parents nicknamed Australia\u2019s most evil.

Now - a fresh development raises the possibility they could get out of jail. Read more about this story, plus see photos, videos and additional reporting, on the website or on The Australian\u2019s app. This episode of The Front is produced and presented by Claire Harve and edited by Joshua Burton.
