      "description": "administered by:\nIsraeli Educational Television.\nThe Third Wave was the name given by history teacher Ron Jones to an experimental recreation of Nazi Germany which he conducted with high school students.\n\nThe experiment took place at Cubberley High School in Palo Alto, California, during one week in 1969[1]. Jones, unable to explain to his students why the German citizens (particularly non-Nazis) allowed the Nazi Party to exterminate millions of Jews and other so-called \u0027undesirables\u0027, decided to show them instead. Jones writes that he started with simple things like classroom discipline, and managed to meld his history class into a group with a supreme sense of purpose and no small amount of cliquishness. Jones named the movement \u0022The Third Wave,\u0022 after the common wisdom that the third in a series of ocean waves is always the strongest, and claimed its members would revolutionize the world. The experiment allegedly took on a life of its own, with students from all over the school joining in;\n\nProducer: Fern Field",

      "description": "James Randy Carlos Channel Hoax\r\n\u0022Carlos\u0022 was the name of a 2,000-year-old spirit allegedly channeled by Jos\u00E9 Alvarez when he toured Australia in 1988. Channeling was all the rage in Australia and an Australian television program contacted James Randi about finding someone who might show Australians that channeling was something doubtful. \r\nRandi approached Alvarez, a performance artist and friend who had long toyed with the idea of creating such a character.\r\n The rest, as they say, is history. Alvarez\r\nlooked at videotapes of other people speaking in strange voices, pretending to be in touch with other worlds, and he picked it up right away. Eventually he went to Australia, took the performance into the Sydney Opera House before a rapt audience there, all handling crystals and beads and whatnot, and with charmed looks on their faces, attracted and enthralled by this man onstage, \r\nJos\u00E9 Alvarez, doing the Spirit of Carlos that was claimed to be 2,000 years old. His performance was very convincing, and actually better than the \u0022real\u0022 chanellers!\r\nHowever, all of the material that he produced was spurious. In the press releases he invented magazines and newspapers, he invented towns and cities and radio stations and TV channels and whatnot, that didn\u0027t even exist.\r\n He prepared videos of radio interviews and theater appearances that never happened. And just one phone call by the media back to the United States would have revealed the whole thing as a hoax. Even after it was all revealed on the Australian Sixty Minutes TV show, a week after the Opera House appearance, many continued to believe in \u0022Carlos\u0022 and his uninspired messages. (Randi, personal correspondence.)\r\nFor Alvarez, the creation of the character \u0022Carlos\u0022 was a performance/experiment to see how far he could take his creation, but his purpose was not to make people look foolish. He hoped to liberate them from a false belief. \r\nHowever, the result of the performance seemed to demonstrate how easy it is to create a cult from scratch and how, even when the truth is revealed to them, some still refuse to accept it. The \u0022Carlos\u0022 hoax also demonstrated how gullible and uncritical the mass media are when covering paranormal or supernatural topics. Rather than having an interest in exposing the truth, the members of the media were obsessed with \u0022Carlos\u0022 the phenomenon and transformed his character from a hoax to a myth.\r\nThe character Alvarez had so arduously created was transmogrified by the press. The media didn\u0027t even need to do any research to have determined that \u0022Carlos\u0022 was not genuine. The biggest clue was handed to them on a silver platter: \u0022Carlos\u0022 performed for free. He offered crystals from Atlantis for sale, but took orders rather than cash. Every journalist should know that the first sign of an authentic fake guru is greed.\r\nJos\u00E9 Alvarez had hoaxed an entire continent with his art. But he had created something that the media and his audiences would take from him and recreate to suit their own needs. One lesson here has to be the magician\u0027s refrain: deception requires cooperation. Another lesson might be that the need to believe in something like a \u0022Carlos\u0022 is so great in some people that we must despair of them ever being liberated. \r\nAlvarez continues to travel the world performing \u0022Carlos\u0022 in a malleable manifestation of his initial \u0022incarnation.\u0022 He appears on global network TV, and performs before large live audiences, engaging them in discussions regarding gurus and the dangers of passive acceptance of unquestioned belief. His goal? To bring people real enlightenment.\r\nHis ongoing exploration of the nature of belief, charisma, and power, and how they intersect, was featured at the 2002 Biennial Exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City.\r\nCarlos hoax - The Skeptic\u0027s Dictionary - Skepdic.com\r\nhttp://www.skepdic.com/carlos.html\r\n\r\nJames Randi Speaks: The Carlos Hoax - YouTube\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0hgP3ioAeA\r\n\r\nJames Randi Speaks: Carl Sagan - YouTube\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccReLF6M62Y\u0026feature=related\r\n\r\nFor the truth about \u0027channeler\u0027 JZ Knight-Ramtha RSE\r\nvisit:\r\nhttp://www.enlightenmefree.com",
