      "description": "In this episode, the host welcomes Jenny as she shares her harrowing journey growing up in the Independent Fundamental Baptist (IFB) movement. Jenny\u0027s story details her family\u0027s deep roots in IFB, the strict and oppressive rules she faced, and the challenges of living under a legalistic and controlling environment. She recounts traumatic experiences, including a public shaming at youth camp, and a disastrous, abusive marriage arranged within the IFB framework. Despite the adversity, Jenny discusses how she sought therapy, found her confidence and sexuality, and eventually escaped the confines of abuse, rebuilding her life. The conversation also touches upon her current views on religion, her relationship with God outside of organized religion, and her path to greater self-awareness and healing. Finally, the episode ends on a lighter note with rapid-fire questions about her newfound discoveries and experiences after leaving the IFB.",
