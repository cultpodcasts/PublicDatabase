      "description": "Amanda has alluded to her religious trauma from her past on this podcast before, and in this episode we decided to dig in. On one hand, we can get to know her better. On another hand, you might relate to her story. And on a third hand, we can all relate: because these same practices and tactics show up in corporate life and in online marketing.\u00A0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the beginning of what turned into a three-part series, so make sure to follow the podcast so you get notified when next week\u2019s episode drops, when we start to dig into Deconstruction. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Check out our YouTube Channel (new videos every Wednesday!):\n\n\nCome meet our FRIENDS. Totally new content (not the same as the podcast episodes).\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@BigBraveBusiness\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect with us on Instagram: \n\n\nwww.instagram.com/bigbravebusiness (http://www.instagram.com/bigbravebusiness) \u00A0\n\n\nFollow Sarah:\n\n\nwww.instagram.com/sarahkheeter (http://www.instagram.com/sarahkheeter) \n\n\nFollow Amanda: \n\n\nwww.instagram.com/amandanelsonreads (http://www.instagram.com/amandanelsonreads)",
