      "description": "An Israeli court previously ruled that an alleged Australian sex abuser Malka Leifer was mentally unfit to be extradited to Australia to face 74 counts of suspected sexual abuse and rape from 2008, when she was principal of a Jewish ultra-orthodox girls school in Melbourne. An Israeli private investigator has been covertly filming Leifer in Israel and has built a case that he claims proves she is a \u0027normal, healthy person\u0027.",
