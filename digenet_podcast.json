      "description": "In this video, we take a closer look at Grace Road Church and its operations in Fiji \u2014 a story that raises difficult questions about faith, leadership, success, and control.\n\nGrace Road built real businesses, infrastructure, and influence, presenting itself as a church with a clear mission and tangible results. But as its power grew, so did concerns about authority, governance, and boundaries.\n\nWe explore:\nWhether Grace Road functioned as a church, a movement, or something else\n\nHow success and scale can blur ethical lines\n\nWhen leadership vision turns into centralized control\n\nThe difference between strong belief and unhealthy dynamics\n\nWhy Fiji became central to the story\n\nThis video is not about attacking faith \u2014 it\u2019s about understanding how organizations can drift when growth outpaces accountability.\n\nComment below: Where should the line be between strong leadership and dangerous control?\n\nSubscribe for thoughtful breakdowns of power, belief systems, and modern institutions.",
