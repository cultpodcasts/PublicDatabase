      "description": "Our family\u0027s spiritual pilgrimage to Beth Sarim in search of Judge Rutherford, Abraham, or any ancient prince.  We chose this over Disney Land.  Plenty of photo shots of the mansion as well as the well groomed grounds.  Could not get to the back where the swimming pool was.  Neighbors questioned us to make sure we were not there to rob them. lol.  Neighbor said many stop to take photos of that home, and that the present home owner had nothing to do with Watchtower.  \n\nI explain why this time period that the Judge lived here is important to me having parents and grandparents struggling in the USA then.",
