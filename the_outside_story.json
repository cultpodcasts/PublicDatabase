Certainly this is a fine way to spend the short time remaining before the wicked world\u2019s end.\u201D\n\n - Kingdom Ministry May 1974 p.3 How Are You Using Your Life?\n\n\nThis is not the time to be toying with the words of Jesus that \u201Cconcerning that day and hour nobody knows , neither the angels of the heavens nor the Son, but only the Father.\u201D (Matt. 24:36) To the contrary, it is a time when one should be keenly aware that the end of this system of things is rapidly coming to its violent end. Make no mistake, it is sufficient that the Father himself knows both the \u201Cday and hour\u201D! \n\n-Watchtower 1968 Aug 15 p.494 Why Are You Looking Forward to 1975?\n\nIf you would like to verify the above quotes, but don\u0027t have access to hard copies of those publications, you\u0027ll need to install the Watchtower Library on DVD for Windows.
