You are a visionary who is aligned with today\u2019s times!\u201D \n\nChris Terry, the elusive founder of the IM Academy, certainly knows what his audience wants to hear. Accused of brainwashing and being the first-ever crypto cult, many feel that IM Academy is actually a global pyramid scheme using cryptocurrency as a dangerous lure to suck in and squeeze money out of the world\u2019s wide-eyed youth, selling dreams of both easy wealth and membership in a new world order? \n\nIn May of 2022, eight members of the Spanish chapter of the organization were arrested for fraud, misleading advertising, psychological coercion, the enticement of minors, and criminal organization. Will this Spanish scandal bring down the crypto cult or is it merely a speed bump on Christopher Terry\u2019s road to riches.\n\nThis episode of Cowboy Kings of Crypto was made in 2022.\n\nWatch more from this series: \n\nFrom Child Star to Eccentric Crypto Billionaire: Brock Pierce\nhttps://youtu.be/48dD21k10nU\n\nThe Dark Side of the Bitcoin Pharaoh\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA7eplSDKs\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

Preaching a mixture of QAnon and sovereign citizen beliefs, she claims she\u2019s fighting a secret, all-powerful cabal of pedophiles that controls both the US and Canadian governments. She also subscribes to a number of bogus, arcane legal theories that say her followers have immunity from existing laws, and that all current governments are secretly illegitimate. Members of her following have described abuse inside the group, including their leader threatening to execute them.\n\nThe Internet has ushered in an era of information overload, but it comes at a cost and \u2018the truth\u2019 is more subjective and contested than ever before. In \u2018Alternate Reality\u2019, we examine corners of the internet where conspiracy theories about the world have started to have a real impact on society.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

      "description": "The Waco siege of 1993 started on February 28th when the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) began the stand-off with the religious sect, the Branch Davidians. The group was led by David Koresh, whose birth name is Vernon Howell. The Branch Davidians, consisting of 91 members, including 25 children, resided in a compound east of Waco, called the Mount Carmel Center. \n\nUnder the suspicion of stockpiling weapons, the ATF attempted to serve search and arrest warrants. Having been warned of the raid, the Branch Davidians were prepared. This initial gunfire battle resulted in deaths on both sides (4 ATF agents and 6 Branch Davidian members) prompting the FBI to become involved. For the following 51 days, the Branch Davidians and law enforcement were at a long and gruesome stand-off, tragically resulting in a fire that took the lives of 76 members. \n\nIn this episode of \u0022I Was There\u0022, VICE meets with Byron Sage, a retired FBI agent, who was one of the lead negotiators during the Waco siege of 1993.\n\n00:00 Intro \n01:36 The Waco Siege \n04:16 Negotiations \n07:01 It was Unprecedented \n10:18 Push Came to Shove \n13:58 The Toughest Call I Ever Made in 50 Years\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.
