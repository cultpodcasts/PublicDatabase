      "description": "In this Fixing My Faith expos\u00E9, we reveal how the Governing Body quietly changed one of their oldest and most important end-times doctrines \u2014 the prophecy of \u201CPeace and Security\u201D from 1 Thessalonians 5:3.\n\nFor over 60 years, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses were taught with absolute certainty that the world\u2019s proclamation of \u201CPeace and Security\u201D would happen right before the Great Tribulation. It was promoted as a final sign\u2026 the prophetic trigger Witnesses were told to watch for.\n\nBut in the February 2026 Watchtower, buried deep in Questions From Readers, the Governing Body quietly slipped in a new version of the doctrine:\n\nNow there are two possibilities \u2014 and even they admit \u201Cwe do not know for sure.\u201D\n\nThis video compares the old doctrine vs. the new doctrine, using their own words from official JW videos and publications, including a clip from their teaching talk on 1 Thessalonians 5:3. The shift isn\u2019t new light \u2014 it\u2019s damage control, and it fundamentally changes the JW end-times timeline.\n\nIf you\u2019re waking up from Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses or need support:\n\uD83C\uDF10 www.exJWFriends.com\n\nFree community \u002B ex-JW certified therapists.
