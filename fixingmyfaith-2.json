Many were raised in the same system.

Many shaped their lives around that understanding, delaying careers, education, and retirement planning. In this video, we walk carefully through actual scenes from the Annual Meeting and examine how Bethel is now being reframed as temporary training, with reassignment back to the field presented as normal and expected.\n\nThis isn\u2019t speculation or rumor.\nWe watch what is said \u2014 and just as importantly, note what is not said.\n\nWe also place this announcement in context, following:\n\u2022 recent Governing Body Updates\n\u2022 a leaked internal letter sent to Bethelites\n\u2022 earlier messaging that quietly shifted expectations behind the scenes\n\nTogether, these developments point to a clear policy shift.\n\nThis video is not about mockery or outrage. It\u2019s about clarity \u2014 especially for those who served, sacrificed, or are trying to understand why things suddenly feel different.\n\n\uD83D\uDCCC Upcoming videos in this series will examine:\n\u2022 how suffering and persecution are framed as proof of truth\n\u2022 Armageddon messaging and claims of physical protection\n\u2022 how major changes are introduced without acknowledging reversals\n\nIf you\u2019re sorting through this and trying to make sense of it \u2014 you\u2019re not alone.\n\nLive your life with love.\nSee more of us on: Creekside Tails - RV Living @creeksidetailsRV \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpxz_Z7Dlb9LMfKx_Sgd57Q\n\n\uD83D\uDCD8 Featured Book: Heaven \u0026 Back in One Night\nOnce a devoted Jehovah\u2019s Witness, I now share a surreal, soul-searching journey that blurs the line between dream and awakening.\nWhat happens when you leave the dogma behind and seek truth on your own terms?\n\uD83D\uDC49 Get the book on Amazon\n\n\uD83C\uDF10 Join the ExJW Community:\n\uD83D\uDDE8\uFE0F Free Discord \u2013 Meet others, talk privately: https://discord.gg/6j3sEVzFRq\n\uD83C\uDF04 For real-life meetups: https://exjwfriends.com/\n\n\uD83D\uDE4C Support the Channel:\n\uD83D\uDCA5 Become a Member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVm5d9cJGHmhbi9JrQgAcXA/join\n\u2615 Donate via PayPal: https://paypal.me/gonegrid\n\nIf you believe Canadian tax dollars shouldn\u2019t support religious groups that practice discrimination or cover up abuse, please sign and share this petition:\n\uD83D\uDC49 https://www.change.org/p/stop-funding-organized-religions-in-canada-that-practice-discrimination\nYour voice helps show our government that these issues matter to voters and survivors.\n\n#ExJW #JWNews #JehovahsWitnesses #ReligiousFreedom #FixingMyFaith #CultAwareness #Deregistration",

Then we look at how identity typically works online, especially for larger websites, archives, and platforms that represent more than one person.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about fear or speculation.\nIt\u2019s about understanding how infrastructure, registration, and legal entities actually function in practice.\n\nTopics covered:\n\nA short, factual recap of the Watchtower subpoenas\n\nHow identity works on platforms like Google \u0026 Cloudflare\n\nWhy larger sites often operate under LLCs or organizations\n\nThe difference between individual users and multi-person platforms\n\nWhat this means for people sharing information vs. hosting archives\n\nWhy understanding the system matters more than panic\n\nNo predictions.\nNo accusations.\nJust clarity.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been following this story and wondering how worried you should be \u2014 this video is meant to help you think clearly, not react emotionally.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone.\n\n\u2014 Vern\nLive your life with love.\n\nSource:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLg0hmzj2vM\n\n\n\uD83D\uDCD8 Featured Book: Heaven \u0026 Back in One Night\nOnce a devoted Jehovah\u2019s Witness, I now share a surreal, soul-searching journey that blurs the line between dream and awakening.\nWhat happens when you leave the dogma behind and seek truth on your own terms?\n\uD83D\uDC49 Get the book on Amazon\n\n\uD83C\uDF10 Join the ExJW Community:\n\uD83D\uDDE8\uFE0F Free Discord \u2013 Meet others, talk privately: https://discord.gg/6j3sEVzFRq\n\uD83C\uDF04 For real-life meetups: https://exjwfriends.com/\n\n\uD83D\uDE4C Support the Channel:\n\uD83D\uDCA5 Become a Member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVm5d9cJGHmhbi9JrQgAcXA/join\n\u2615 Donate via PayPal: https://paypal.me/gonegrid\n\nIf you believe Canadian tax dollars shouldn\u2019t support religious groups that practice discrimination or cover up abuse, please sign and share this petition:\n\uD83D\uDC49 https://www.change.org/p/stop-funding-organized-religions-in-canada-that-practice-discrimination\nYour voice helps show our government that these issues matter to voters and survivors.\n\n#ExJW #JWNews #JehovahsWitnesses #ReligiousFreedom #FixingMyFaith #CultAwareness #Deregistration",

People move through different stages, often back and forth, at their own pace. None of these stages mean someone is weak, broken, or failing.\n\nIn this long-form meta discussion, I walk through:\n\nWhy discomfort comes before doubt\n\nWhy scripture-dumping often appears under pressure\n\nWhy anger is not failure \u2014 but agency returning\n\nWhy some people go quiet for a long time\n\nWhy others feel compelled to speak out\n\nAnd why we shouldn\u2019t rush anyone through their own waking-up process\n\nThis video is a continuation of the conversation started in my previous video about Watchtower\u2019s copyright subpoenas \u2014 where many viewers asked what I meant by the phrase \u201Canger is agency returning.\u201D\n\nThis is not about doctrine.\nNot about debate.\nAnd not about telling anyone where they should land.\n\nIt\u2019s about understanding the human process of waking up \u2014 with compassion.\n\nIf you\u2019re somewhere on this road, you\u2019re not alone \u2014 and you don\u2019t owe anyone speed.\n\nLive your life with love.\n\n\uD83D\uDD17 Support \u0026 community:\n\uD83D\uDC49 www.exJWFriends.com\n\n\uD83D\uDCD8 Featured Book: Heaven \u0026 Back in One Night\nOnce a devoted Jehovah\u2019s Witness, I now share a surreal, soul-searching journey that blurs the line between dream and awakening.\nWhat happens when you leave the dogma behind and seek truth on your own terms?\n\uD83D\uDC49 Get the book on Amazon\n\n\uD83C\uDF10 Join the ExJW Community:\n\uD83D\uDDE8\uFE0F Free Discord \u2013 Meet others, talk privately: https://discord.gg/6j3sEVzFRq\n\uD83C\uDF04 For real-life meetups: https://exjwfriends.com/\n\n\uD83D\uDE4C Support the Channel:\n\uD83D\uDCA5 Become a Member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVm5d9cJGHmhbi9JrQgAcXA/join\n\u2615 Donate via PayPal: https://paypal.me/gonegrid\n\nIf you believe Canadian tax dollars shouldn\u2019t support religious groups that practice discrimination or cover up abuse, please sign and share this petition:\n\uD83D\uDC49 https://www.change.org/p/stop-funding-organized-religions-in-canada-that-practice-discrimination\nYour voice helps show our government that these issues matter to voters and survivors.\n\n#ExJW #JWNews #JehovahsWitnesses #ReligiousFreedom #FixingMyFaith #CultAwareness #Deregistration",

      "description": "\uD83D\uDDDE\uFE0F Major update today on the $100 million federal lawsuit filed against Watchtower and the Governing Body of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.\n\nNew court documents show that the Governing Body has now been officially served in New York, meaning the case is fully active and moving forward. The filing also reveals that Watchtower sent representatives overseas before the lawsuit was filed, attempting to address the matter privately.\n\nOne of the biggest questions from viewers was whether someone living in another country can sue a U.S. organization \u2014 and this case gives us the answer. Yes, under U.S. federal law, international plaintiffs can bring a case against an American corporation or leadership body if decisions made in the United States are alleged to have played a role.\n\nThis update focuses only on the legal and procedural developments \u2014 no case details and nothing graphic. This is a neutral breakdown of what the documents say and what this could mean for Watchtower going forward, including the possibility of a new level of accountability for global policies.\n\nMore updates will follow as the filings continue.\n\nSource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix9qkekG3w0\n\nLive your life with love.\n\n\uD83D\uDCCC Support our community:\nwww.exJWFriends.com\n\n\uD83D\uDCD8 Featured Book: Heaven \u0026 Back in One Night\nOnce a devoted Jehovah\u2019s Witness, I now share a surreal, soul-searching journey that blurs the line between dream and awakening.\nWhat happens when you leave the dogma behind and seek truth on your own terms?\n\uD83D\uDC49 Get the book on Amazon\n\n\uD83C\uDF10 Join the ExJW Community:\n\uD83D\uDDE8\uFE0F Free Discord \u2013 Meet others, talk privately: https://discord.gg/6j3sEVzFRq\n\uD83C\uDF04 For real-life meetups: https://exjwfriends.com/\n\n\uD83D\uDE4C Support the Channel:\n\uD83D\uDCA5 Become a Member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVm5d9cJGHmhbi9JrQgAcXA/join\n\u2615 Donate via PayPal: https://paypal.me/gonegrid\n\nIf you believe Canadian tax dollars shouldn\u2019t support religious groups that practice discrimination or cover up abuse, please sign and share this petition:\n\uD83D\uDC49 https://www.change.org/p/stop-funding-organized-religions-in-canada-that-practice-discrimination\nYour voice helps show our government that these issues matter to voters and survivors.\n\n#ExJW #JWNews #JehovahsWitnesses #ReligiousFreedom #FixingMyFaith #CultAwareness #Deregistration",

It was promoted as a final sign\u2026 the prophetic trigger Witnesses were told to watch for.\n\nBut in the February 2026 Watchtower, buried deep in Questions From Readers, the Governing Body quietly slipped in a new version of the doctrine:\n\nNow there are two possibilities \u2014 and even they admit \u201Cwe do not know for sure.\u201D\n\nThis video compares the old doctrine vs. the new doctrine, using their own words from official JW videos and publications, including a clip from their teaching talk on 1 Thessalonians 5:3.
