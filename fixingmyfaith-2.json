      "description": "\uD83D\uDDDE\uFE0F Major update today on the $100 million federal lawsuit filed against Watchtower and the Governing Body of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.\n\nNew court documents show that the Governing Body has now been officially served in New York, meaning the case is fully active and moving forward. The filing also reveals that Watchtower sent representatives overseas before the lawsuit was filed, attempting to address the matter privately.\n\nOne of the biggest questions from viewers was whether someone living in another country can sue a U.S. organization \u2014 and this case gives us the answer. Yes, under U.S. federal law, international plaintiffs can bring a case against an American corporation or leadership body if decisions made in the United States are alleged to have played a role.\n\nThis update focuses only on the legal and procedural developments \u2014 no case details and nothing graphic. This is a neutral breakdown of what the documents say and what this could mean for Watchtower going forward, including the possibility of a new level of accountability for global policies.\n\nMore updates will follow as the filings continue.\n\nSource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix9qkekG3w0\n\nLive your life with love.\n\n\uD83D\uDCCC Support our community:\nwww.exJWFriends.com\n\n\uD83D\uDCD8 Featured Book: Heaven \u0026 Back in One Night\nOnce a devoted Jehovah\u2019s Witness, I now share a surreal, soul-searching journey that blurs the line between dream and awakening.\nWhat happens when you leave the dogma behind and seek truth on your own terms?\n\uD83D\uDC49 Get the book on Amazon\n\n\uD83C\uDF10 Join the ExJW Community:\n\uD83D\uDDE8\uFE0F Free Discord \u2013 Meet others, talk privately: https://discord.gg/6j3sEVzFRq\n\uD83C\uDF04 For real-life meetups: https://exjwfriends.com/\n\n\uD83D\uDE4C Support the Channel:\n\uD83D\uDCA5 Become a Member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVm5d9cJGHmhbi9JrQgAcXA/join\n\u2615 Donate via PayPal: https://paypal.me/gonegrid\n\nIf you believe Canadian tax dollars shouldn\u2019t support religious groups that practice discrimination or cover up abuse, please sign and share this petition:\n\uD83D\uDC49 https://www.change.org/p/stop-funding-organized-religions-in-canada-that-practice-discrimination\nYour voice helps show our government that these issues matter to voters and survivors.\n\n#ExJW #JWNews #JehovahsWitnesses #ReligiousFreedom #FixingMyFaith #CultAwareness #Deregistration",

      "description": "In this Fixing My Faith expos\u00E9, we reveal how the Governing Body quietly changed one of their oldest and most important end-times doctrines \u2014 the prophecy of \u201CPeace and Security\u201D from 1 Thessalonians 5:3.\n\nFor over 60 years, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses were taught with absolute certainty that the world\u2019s proclamation of \u201CPeace and Security\u201D would happen right before the Great Tribulation. It was promoted as a final sign\u2026 the prophetic trigger Witnesses were told to watch for.\n\nBut in the February 2026 Watchtower, buried deep in Questions From Readers, the Governing Body quietly slipped in a new version of the doctrine:\n\nNow there are two possibilities \u2014 and even they admit \u201Cwe do not know for sure.\u201D\n\nThis video compares the old doctrine vs. the new doctrine, using their own words from official JW videos and publications, including a clip from their teaching talk on 1 Thessalonians 5:3. The shift isn\u2019t new light \u2014 it\u2019s damage control, and it fundamentally changes the JW end-times timeline.\n\nIf you\u2019re waking up from Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses or need support:\n\uD83C\uDF10 www.exJWFriends.com\n\nFree community \u002B ex-JW certified therapists.
