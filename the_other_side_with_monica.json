I have not formally left, I am categorized as an inactive witness, so I guess this is me coming out! \n\nI\u0027m a bit awkward in the beginning, but I open up as the video goes along. I keep using the words religion, church, and organisation interchangeably throughout this video. I hope it\u0027s not too confusing for those that don\u0027t know much about this organisation. \n\nLinked below are a few resources to explore. \n\nPlease feel free to leave questions or any other related content you would like me to cover, maybe I\u0027ll create a part 2 about how I left in more detail and how the elders came to visit me twice after I stopped attending.\n\nResources:\nEscaping Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses: Inside the dangerous world of a brutal religion ://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDwHdj7plWo\u0026t=1155s\n\nAustralian Royal Commission playlist -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9q2ImaE_lg\u0026list=PLtizNalcHHE-nfRihJfOCI-_kA4Pis_JK\u0026ab_channel=JakkeControl\n\nMalawi \u0026 Mexico Oath of Allegiance  - https://www.jwfacts.com/verdadtj/atalaya/malaui-mexico-juramento-lealtad.php\n\nChanged teachings - https://www.jwfacts.com/watchtower/changed-watchtower-teachings.php\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMusic: \nJeff Kaale - Secret Sauce\n\n\nThank you for watching!\n\n#JW #Jehovah\u0027sWitnesses #Cult",
