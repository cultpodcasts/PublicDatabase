We discuss: What the Netflix docuseries got wrong\u2014and how she\u2019s correcting it. The emotional and creative process of writing a 200,000-word memoir over eight years. How storytelling, honesty, and empathy can help others escape manipulative relationships. Quotes from Sam: \u201CI was in a cult of one.\u201D \u201CPeople very often don\u0027t understand how this happens to someone who\u2019s intelligent, who went to a good school, and started a business. But it does happen.\u201D \u201CI started writing immediately after I got out of jail.\u201D \u201CI had no editorial control... They basically changed the reality of what happened.\u201D (on the Bad Vegan docuseries) \u201CI didn\u2019t want anybody telling me what I can and can\u2019t put in there... I wanted to have control over my story.\u201D \u201CThe book is long because I needed the reader to go through the psychological experience with me.\u201D \u201CI have all my receipts. I included actual journal entries, G-chats, texts, and emails.\u201D \u201CThe writing was therapeutic, but also grueling. Sometimes I felt like I was crawling up the wall and slithering out of my skin.\u201D \u201CI want the story to be useful. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve wanted all along.\u201D \u201CPeople tell me, \u2018I don\u2019t read books anymore, but I read yours.\u2019 That feels amazing.\u201D \u201CEven if you\u0027re never going to publish it, writing about what happened to you can bring real relief.\u201D \u201CI turned down a deal with a major studio because I didn\u2019t want to give up control of my story again.\u201D \u201CIt wasn\u2019t about power\u2014it was about protecting the integrity of the story.\u201D \u201CSomeone told me they left a toxic relationship because of reading my book. That alone makes it all worth it.\u201D",
