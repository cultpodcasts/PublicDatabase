      "title": "From The Archives:  What Could Bryan Kohberger Learn From The Lori Vallow Trial",
      "description": "Lori Vallow Daybell did not receive the death penalty due to a combination of factors primarily related to the management and timing of evidence disclosures by the prosecution. The defense argued that the prosecution\u0027s late submission of thousands of documents and pieces of evidence impeded their ability to adequately prepare for trial. Judge Steven Boyce ruled to remove the death penalty to ensure that Vallow Daybell\u0027s constitutional rights were protected, allowing her defense team sufficient time to review the evidence. The judge emphasized that his decision was not to penalize the state but to avoid potential reversible errors that could arise from discovery issues if a death sentence were imposed\u200B.\u00A0\u00A0\n\nThe implications of this decision might influence Bryan Kohberger\u0027s case, as his defense team could leverage similar arguments regarding evidence handling and procedural fairness. Kohberger, charged with the murders of four University of Idaho students, is facing the death penalty. His defense has been actively challenging the prosecution on various procedural grounds, including the handling and disclosure of DNA evidence and other investigative materials\u200B.\n\nIn this episode, we dive in and take a look at the possibility of Bryan Kohberger avoiding the death penalty due to prosecutorial misconduct.\n\n\n\n(commercial at 9:31)\n\nto contact me:\n\nbobbycapucci@protonmail.com\n\n\nsource:\n\nIdaho suspect Bryan Kohberger\u0027s team could use same tactic as cult mom Lori Vallow to avoid death penalty if convicted | The US Sun (the-sun.com)",
