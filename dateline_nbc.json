      "description": "After more than 13 hours of deliberation over three days, the New York jury found Combs not guilty on a RICO conspiracy charge, not guilty on a sex trafficking charge involving Cassie Ventura, and not guilty on a sex trafficking charge involving his ex-girlfriend \u0022Jane,\u0022 who testified under a pseudonym. He was convicted on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, then denied bond while he waits for his sentencing hearing. That hearing is scheduled for October but could move up. The prosecution is arguing he should be sentenced to around four and a half years, while the defense says the federal guidelines for his offenses put him closer to two years.
