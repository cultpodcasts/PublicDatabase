      "description": "The Source Family are one of the 20th century\u0027s most mysterious religious cults. Emerging from a famous Hollywood vegetarian restaurant where Yoko Ono, Marlon Brando and Woody Allen all were regulars, the Source Family were not your typical restaurant-owners. Fuelled by rock \u0026 roll, they had a secret cult led by professed guru, musician and (vegan) bank robber, Father Yod. Influenced by the teachings of Yogi Bhajan and the astrological age of Aquarius, they practiced utopian living, until they were chased out of LA forever.\n\nSubscribe to Parable for more Religious History documentaries! \n\nIt\u0027s like Netflix for history... \uD83D\uDCFA Sign up to History Hit, the world\u0027s best history documentary service and get 50% off using the code \u0027PARABLE\u0027 http://bit.ly/3e2c2Xs\n\nThis channel is part of the History Hit Network.
