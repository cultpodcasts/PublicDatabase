It spread through Discord, Telegram, and gaming platforms\u2014built around \u201Clorebooks,\u201D collections of coerced violence traded for status. In a strange twist, this harm group has connections to cybercrime groups we\u0027ve covered on this show before. Note: I was recording in an office, which between that and the subject matter, explains why my tone is pretty hushed in this one.
