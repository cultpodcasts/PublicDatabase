      "title": "Cargo Cults: When WWII Supplies Became a Religion",
      "description": "During World War II, isolated island communities in the South Pacific witnessed something extraordinary: aircraft landing with radios, weapons, food, and medicine\u2014then disappearing without explanation. When the war ended and the planes stopped coming, some local groups took a bold step.\nThey built imitation airstrips, crafted wooden radios, and created rituals to summon the cargo back.\n\nIn today\u2019s episode, Gordy explores the strange, profound world of cargo cults\u2014what they really were, how they started, and what they reveal about belief, colonialism, and the way we explain the unexplainable. From the mysterious figure of John Frum to modern-day uses of the phrase in science and tech culture, this story is far more relevant\u2014and unsettling\u2014than it seems.\nHow do people react when an alien world drops out of the sky\u2026 and then vanishes?\n\nWatch to the end to learn how a WWII legacy turned into ritual, mythology, and mimicry\u2014and why the term \u201Ccargo cult\u201D still echoes in conversations about science, programming, and even self-help culture.\n\nSources:\nWorsley, P.
