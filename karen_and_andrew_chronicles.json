      "description": "We were 17 years old, in love, and pregnant with our first daughter.\nWhat followed wasn\u2019t support\u2014it was punishment.\nIn this video, we share what happened after we told the elders in the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses about our pregnancy. We were called into a judicial meeting with three elders, asked deeply personal questions, and then given very different outcomes: one of us was reproved, the other disfellowshipped.\nBecause of that decision, we were forced to stay apart for 11 months during the pregnancy.\nWe were only allowed to see each other a handful of times.\nWe were told to treat our relationship like a business transaction.\nAnd we were too young, scared, and conditioned to be as outraged as we should have been.\nLooking back now, the emotional damage is impossible to ignore.\nWe\u2019re grateful beyond words for our daughter\u2014but we still grieve the time that was taken from us. This video is us finally saying out loud what we didn\u2019t know how to say back then.\nIf you\u2019ve experienced religious control, shunning, or separation\u2014or if you\u2019re questioning your faith\u2014we hope our story helps you feel less alone.",

      "title": "How Leaving Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Rewired Our Brains (The Part No One Talks About)",
      "description": "For most of our lives, we were taught that this life didn\u2019t really matter.\nAs Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, we believed the real life would come later \u2014 after Armageddon, in a \u201Cnew system,\u201D on a paradise earth. That belief quietly shaped everything: our goals, our urgency, our relationships, and even how we understood time itself.\nIn this video, we open up about what happens after you leave that belief behind.\nLeaving Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses didn\u2019t just change what we believed \u2014 it rewired our brains. Suddenly, forever disappeared. Time became finite. The weight of responsibility, family, purpose, and the fear of loss all hit at once. And with that came anxiety, grief, urgency\u2026 and the painful realization of how much time was already gone.\nWe talk honestly about:\nHow the \u201Cparadise earth\u201D teaching affects motivation and goals\nWhy time doesn\u2019t feel real when you believe you\u2019ll live forever\nThe emotional crash that happens when that belief is gone\nWhy ex-Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses often feel like they\u2019re \u201Cbehind\u201D in life\nAnd why kindness and patience matter so much for people leaving high-control religions\nIf you\u2019ve left the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses \u2014 or any high-control religion \u2014 you are not broken. You\u2019re relearning life in real time.\nAnd if you\u2019ve never been in one, we hope this helps you understand why leaving is so much more than just \u201Cwalking away.\u201D\nThanks for listening to our story. \uD83E\uDD0D\n\u2014 Andrew \u0026 Karen",

      "description": "This video means more than we can put into words.\nGrowing up as Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, we never celebrated Christmas. No tree. No lights. No ornaments. We spent our whole lives watching the world around us celebrate something we weren\u2019t allowed to experience.\nBut this year\u2026 everything changed.\nToday, we decorated our very first Christmas tree \u2014 together, as a family \u2014 and it was emotional, funny, chaotic, and healing all at the same time. \uD83C\uDF84\u2764\uFE0F\nFrom choosing lights and ornaments to naming our tree \u201CEleanor\u201D (because of course she needed a name \uD83D\uDE02), this moment is something we\u2019ll remember forever.\nIt\u2019s more than a tree.\nIt\u2019s freedom.\nIt\u2019s reclaiming memories we never got to have.\nIt\u2019s choosing joy \u2014 finally, on our own terms.\nIf you grew up in a high-control religion or you\u2019re on your healing journey too, just know:\nYou\u2019re not alone. And it\u2019s never too late to create new traditions.\nThank you for being here for our very first Christmas season.\nMore memories are on the way. \u2728",
