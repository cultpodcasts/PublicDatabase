Emily shares her journey from a life devoid of love and support within the cult to finding freedom and happiness. The conversation delves into the origins of His Way Ministries, the nature of cult leadership, family dynamics, and the impact of pro-life activism on her upbringing. Emily reflects on her childhood experiences, the transition to rural life, and the challenges of education in isolation, providing a poignant insight into the complexities of growing up in a cult. In this conversation, Emily shares her harrowing experiences of childhood exploitation, the impact of community support, and the trauma of witnessing a murder. She discusses the complexities of her family dynamics, the isolation she felt, and the pivotal moments that led her to seek independence and healing. The conversation highlights the stark contrast between the nurturing presence of individuals and the controlling nature of her family, culminating in a tragic event that changed her life forever.\n\nEmily\u0027s TikTok - \u00A0@emilyclede\n\nGet in Touch or Support:\u00A0\nPatreon - patreon.com/thecultvault\nCrimecon UK 2025 https://www.crimecon.co.uk - use code CULT for 10% off tickets!\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/cultvaultpod/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CultVaultPod\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/Cult-Vault\nGmail: cultvaultpodcast@gmail.com",

In this conversation, Cynane Shay shares her journey of political disillusionment and the impact of conspiracy theories on her family dynamics. She reflects on her inability to vote during the 2016 election due to conflicting beliefs about the candidates and discusses how her family\u0027s increasing obsession with Trump and conspiracy theories affected her perspective. The conversation delves into the rise of QAnon, the influence of COVID-19 on beliefs, and the challenges faced during her wedding planning amidst political tensions. Ultimately, Cynane describes her process of breaking free from indoctrination and finding clarity in her beliefs. In this conversation, Cynane Shay discusses the psychological underpinnings of conspiracy theories and cults, exploring how individuals seek order in chaotic environments.

It is an exciting time here as I embark on the Psychology of Coercive Control masters course at Salford University. As I am studying, I will be releasing remastered versions of the podcast\u0027s earliest episodes. Here is my first ever interview with guests David and Amelia, both speaking about their experiences in different sects of the Pentecostalism movement. There is an update from guests on the blog post linked at the top of this description. This episode originally aired on May 30th 2020. In this episode you will hear cleaner editing, enhanced audio and a much less educated Kacey! Let me know your thoughts and thank you to David and Amelia and to all the listeners who have stuck with the show.

August is International Cult Awareness Month. Please visit this website to learn more, find out how you can support, calls to action and survivor resources. International Cult Awareness Month (ICAM) is when communities come together to highlight the dangers and realities of cultic practices. We hope to provide support for those affected. Every August, ICAM aims to educate the public about cults and their harmful impacts.ICAM seeks to expose the covert operations of cults, equipping individuals with the necessary knowledge and resources to combat and prevent cultic manipulation.

In that time, I\u2019ve published over 250 survivor stories, interviewed countless experts in the field, from therapists, to lawyers, to domestic violence advocates and agencies. My philosophy for the podcast was to be different, and to me, that meant to be real, not clinical. My goal was to help survivors tell/validate their own stories, but to also validate and teach other survivors through those stories.

I have known Sam for over a decade and we have shared a lot of time together, travelled Europe together and completed a BA(Hons) Degree with one another. Never did I think he had been through something like this. This is a testament to how every day people all around us can be coerced into an abusive group.Watch the live chat back here - https://youtu.be/-ngMmHJr3N4Get in Touch or Support -Patreon -\u00A0patreon.com/thecultvaultCult Vault Shop -\u00A0cultvaultpodcast.com/shopCrimecon UK 2022 -\u00A0https://www.crimecon.co.uk/Instagram:\u00A0https://www.instagram.com/cultvaultpod/Twitter:\u00A0https://twitter.com/CultVaultPodReddit:\u00A0https://www.reddit.com/user/Cult-VaultGmail:\u00A0cultvaultpodcast@gmail.comSupport this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/cultvaultpodcast/exclusive-contentAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacyThis show is part of the Spreaker Prime Network, if you are interested in advertising on this podcast, contact us at https://www.spreaker.com/show/5704277/advertisement",

      "description": "In this episode I chat with the incredible author Heather Grace Heath about her memoir \u0022Lovingly Abused - A True Story of Overcoming Cults, Gaslighting \u0026 Legal Educational Neglect\u0022. We discuss her life growing up in Bill Gothard\u0027s IBLP \u0026 ATI and the problems around homeschooling and educational neglect. From Heather\u0027s website - In this highly relevant memoir, blending raw honesty and humor, Heather Heath\u2019s story begins with her mother\u2019s search for escape from childhood trauma, becoming perfect prey for a cult. It follows Heather\u2019s coming of age journey while enduring gaslighting,\u00A0educational neglect, suicide attempts, purity culture, realizing she was in a cult once she was physically trapped, the painful choice to be shunned for becoming a paramedic,\u00A0marriage, divorce, spiritual deconstruction, trusting again, reluctantly homeschooling through a pandemic, and finally discovering her own faith. Giving each reader insight into a hidden world using pop-culture comparisons, you\u2019ll feel as if you were having a\u00A0real-life conversation with her.\u00A0\u00A0This book\u2019s mission is to raise public awareness of hidden children all over America who are legally educationally neglected under the guise of religion. Seeing one such family on\u00A0TV is a cult\u2019s convenient distraction from the thousands of women and children who are invisible.\u00A0\u00A0Heather has committed to distribute fifteen percent of the book\u2019s sales profits to The\u00A0Coalition for Responsible Home Education, The Vashti Initiative, and The Amish\u00A0Heritage Foundation; non-profits supporting a child\u2019s right to an education and providing guidance to those leaving the abusive practices hidden behind religion, with little to no resources for independence. As similar non-profits emerge and funds allow, more of her profits will be allocated to them.\u00A0\u00A0Heather\u0027s Website - https://heathergraceheath.com/Falling Out with Elgen Strait Podcast -\u00A0www.fallingoutpod.comCult Vault Shop -\u00A0cultvaultpodcast.com/shopCrimecon UK 2022 -\u00A0https://www.crimecon.co.uk/Get In TouchInstagram:\u00A0https://www.instagram.com/cultvaultpod/Twitter:\u00A0https://twitter.com/CultVaultPodTumblr:\u00A0https://www.tumblr.com/blog/cultvaultReddit:\u00A0https://www.reddit.com/user/Cult-VaultGmail: cultvaultpodcast@gmail.comPatreon:\u00A0https://www.patreon.com/thecultvaultSupport this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/cultvaultpodcast/exclusive-contentAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacyThis show is part of the Spreaker Prime Network, if you are interested in advertising on this podcast, contact us at https://www.spreaker.com/show/5704277/advertisement",

Her father is currently a Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses Elder despite holding previous positions during his JW tenure that include bearing arms and political employment as well as committing bigamy and adultery. Does this hold consequence over Laurin\u0027s father\u0027s current position of Elder in the JW church? Should it hold consequence? Should his current behaviour come into question when he holds the power to shun individuals and enforce family seperation, trauma and significant decision making over his flock?We extend these questions to other people in positions of leadership and this is what we discuss at length in this episode.The mentioned TIKTOK video - https://www.tiktok.com/@iuniusfaber/video/7010430939784367366Vennie\u0027s e-book FREE UNTIL MARCH 8TH - https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cult-Child-Vennie-Kocsis-ebook/dp/B016L2HE8G/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1OJOF8V3R4RFC\u0026keywords=vennie\u002Bkocsis\u0026qid=1646421658\u0026sprefix=vennie\u002Bkocsis%2Caps%2C216\u0026sr=8-2Cult Vault Shop -\u00A0cultvaultpodcast.com/shopCrimecon UK 2022 -\u00A0https://www.crimecon.co.uk/Ally Awards -\u00A0https://www.cultvaultpodcast.com/about-3Get In TouchInstagram:\u00A0https://www.instagram.com/cultvaultpod/Twitter:\u00A0https://twitter.com/CultVaultPodTumblr:\u00A0https://www.tumblr.com/blog/cultvaultReddit:\u00A0https://www.reddit.com/user/Cult-VaultGmail: cultvaultpodcast@gmail.comPatreon:\u00A0https://www.patreon.com/thecultvaultSupport this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/cultvaultpodcast/exclusive-contentAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacyThis show is part of the Spreaker Prime Network, if you are interested in advertising on this podcast, contact us at https://www.spreaker.com/show/5704277/advertisement",
