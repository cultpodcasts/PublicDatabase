      "description": "In this week\u0027s shorter episode, I sit down to talk with the legendary forensic social worker Evan Stark who played a vital role in getting coercive controlled criminalised in the UK. Through Evan\u0027s career of fighting painstakingly beside women who have experienced all manner of abuse, Evan was able to compile his key text \u0022Coercive Control - How Men Entrap Women in Personal Life\u0022. As we head into learning about coercive control in domestic environments in the Psychology of Coercive Control masters course at the University of Salford, I thought this would be a perfect time to finally release this episode.

Known as one of the \u0022NXIVM Nine\u0022 - a group of original members - Susan watched insurmountable horrors unfold, as the company she believed in and dedicated her life too, began to turn toxic, exploitative and illegal.

As former members of the cult, our guests share their harrowing experiences, detailing the physical, emotional and sexual abuse, as well as the indoctrination tactics used by the group\u0027s leaders. But the voices of these 2 survivors are not just victims - they have become advocates for cult education and awareness. Jemima and Whisper are now the hosts of their own podcast, where they provide a platform for other survivors to share their stories and discuss the continuing relevance of cults in society today.Throughout this engaging and thought-provoking conversation, we explore the challenges of leaving a cult, the importance of support and community in recovery, and the power of speaking out against abuse and manipulation.Join us for this powerful conversation with two inspiring women who are working to create a safer, more informed world - TW, sensitive content ahead.Butterflies and Bravery - https://www.butterfliesandbravery.comPodcast Promotion - The Truth that Heals on Apple PodcastsCrimecon tickets available here - www.crimecon.co.ukGet in Touch or Support:Patreon - patreon.com/thecultvaultCult Vault Shop - cultvaultpodcast.com/shopCrimecon UK 2022 - https://www.crimecon.co.uk/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/cultvaultpod/Twitter: https://twitter.com/CultVaultPodReddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/Cult-VaultGmail: cultvaultpodcast@gmail.comThis show is part of the Spreaker Prime Network, if you are interested in advertising on this podcast, contact us at https://www.spreaker.com/show/5704277/advertisement",

      "description": "When being disfellowshipped from the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, individuals often experience being completely closed off and shunned from their own congregation. Often times, in high demand religious groups such as the JW\u0027s, this community is all the individual has ever known, including family and close friends. The strain placed on marriages adds an extra layer of turmoil. In Daniel O\u0027Brien\u0027s case, the relationship with his young sons would forever changed. In this episode, Daniel unpacks hypocrisy in the organisation, shunning and life after Jehovah. We also discuss Daniel\u0027s role in the world as a history teacher who implements critical thinking assignments into the classroom.Podcast Promotion - Generation Cult \u2013 A podcast about people who grew up in cults \u0022To Captive Hearts and Minds\u0022 - Ex-JW Poetry (jehovahs-witness.com)Crimecon tickets available here - www.crimecon.co.ukGet in Touch or Support:Patreon - patreon.com/thecultvaultCult Vault Shop - cultvaultpodcast.com/shopCrimecon UK 2022 - https://www.crimecon.co.uk/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/cultvaultpod/Twitter: https://twitter.com/CultVaultPodReddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/Cult-VaultGmail: cultvaultpodcast@gmail.comThis show is part of the Spreaker Prime Network, if you are interested in advertising on this podcast, contact us at https://www.spreaker.com/show/5704277/advertisement",

I have known Sam for over a decade and we have shared a lot of time together, travelled Europe together and completed a BA(Hons) Degree with one another. Never did I think he had been through something like this.

We discuss her life growing up in Bill Gothard\u0027s IBLP \u0026 ATI and the problems around homeschooling and educational neglect. From Heather\u0027s website - In this highly relevant memoir, blending raw honesty and humor, Heather Heath\u2019s story begins with her mother\u2019s search for escape from childhood trauma, becoming perfect prey for a cult. It follows Heather\u2019s coming of age journey while enduring gaslighting,\u00A0educational neglect, suicide attempts, purity culture, realizing she was in a cult once she was physically trapped, the painful choice to be shunned for becoming a paramedic,\u00A0marriage, divorce, spiritual deconstruction, trusting again, reluctantly homeschooling through a pandemic, and finally discovering her own faith. Giving each reader insight into a hidden world using pop-culture comparisons, you\u2019ll feel as if you were having a\u00A0real-life conversation with her.\u00A0\u00A0This book\u2019s mission is to raise public awareness of hidden children all over America who are legally educationally neglected under the guise of religion. Seeing one such family on\u00A0TV is a cult\u2019s convenient distraction from the thousands of women and children who are invisible.\u00A0\u00A0Heather has committed to distribute fifteen percent of the book\u2019s sales profits to The\u00A0Coalition for Responsible Home Education, The Vashti Initiative, and The Amish\u00A0Heritage Foundation; non-profits supporting a child\u2019s right to an education and providing guidance to those leaving the abusive practices hidden behind religion, with little to no resources for independence. As similar non-profits emerge and funds allow, more of her profits will be allocated to them.\u00A0\u00A0Heather\u0027s Website - https://heathergraceheath.com/Falling Out with Elgen Strait Podcast -\u00A0www.fallingoutpod.comCult Vault Shop -\u00A0cultvaultpodcast.com/shopCrimecon UK 2022 -\u00A0https://www.crimecon.co.uk/Get In TouchInstagram:\u00A0https://www.instagram.com/cultvaultpod/Twitter:\u00A0https://twitter.com/CultVaultPodTumblr:\u00A0https://www.tumblr.com/blog/cultvaultReddit:\u00A0https://www.reddit.com/user/Cult-VaultGmail: cultvaultpodcast@gmail.comPatreon:\u00A0https://www.patreon.com/thecultvaultSupport this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/cultvaultpodcast/exclusive-contentAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacyThis show is part of the Spreaker Prime Network, if you are interested in advertising on this podcast, contact us at https://www.spreaker.com/show/5704277/advertisement",

Her father is currently a Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses Elder despite holding previous positions during his JW tenure that include bearing arms and political employment as well as committing bigamy and adultery. Does this hold consequence over Laurin\u0027s father\u0027s current position of Elder in the JW church? Should it hold consequence? Should his current behaviour come into question when he holds the power to shun individuals and enforce family seperation, trauma and significant decision making over his flock?We extend these questions to other people in positions of leadership and this is what we discuss at length in this episode.The mentioned TIKTOK video - https://www.tiktok.com/@iuniusfaber/video/7010430939784367366Vennie\u0027s e-book FREE UNTIL MARCH 8TH - https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cult-Child-Vennie-Kocsis-ebook/dp/B016L2HE8G/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1OJOF8V3R4RFC\u0026keywords=vennie\u002Bkocsis\u0026qid=1646421658\u0026sprefix=vennie\u002Bkocsis%2Caps%2C216\u0026sr=8-2Cult Vault Shop -\u00A0cultvaultpodcast.com/shopCrimecon UK 2022 -\u00A0https://www.crimecon.co.uk/Ally Awards -\u00A0https://www.cultvaultpodcast.com/about-3Get In TouchInstagram:\u00A0https://www.instagram.com/cultvaultpod/Twitter:\u00A0https://twitter.com/CultVaultPodTumblr:\u00A0https://www.tumblr.com/blog/cultvaultReddit:\u00A0https://www.reddit.com/user/Cult-VaultGmail: cultvaultpodcast@gmail.comPatreon:\u00A0https://www.patreon.com/thecultvaultSupport this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/cultvaultpodcast/exclusive-contentAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacyThis show is part of the Spreaker Prime Network, if you are interested in advertising on this podcast, contact us at https://www.spreaker.com/show/5704277/advertisement",

This interview comes with themes of abuse and addiction and is difficult to listen too at parts. Discretion is advised. Madison depicts her time in a troubled teen facility that seconds as a housing environment for religious families. During her time, Madison struggled with abuse, sexuality, guilt around traumatic experiences and her wholehearted belief in hell - as well as trying to protect herself and others from sexual assaults that they were often then blamed for. With plenty of earmarks of the TTI, Madison\u0027s journey to independence and activism is truly inspiring.Salt Lake Tribune Article -https://www.sltrib.com/news/2022/02/14/utah-regulators-say-girl/ Morgan Stringer\u0027s Article - https://religiondispatches.org/for-lgbtq-people-christian-schools-can-be-traumatizing/https://trappedintreatment.com/https://www.unsilenced.org/https://www.breakingcodesilence.org/Cult Vault Shop -\u00A0cultvaultpodcast.com/shopCrimecon UK 2022 -\u00A0https://www.crimecon.co.uk/Ally Awards -\u00A0https://www.cultvaultpodcast.com/about-3Get In TouchInstagram:\u00A0https://www.instagram.com/cultvaultpod/Twitter:\u00A0https://twitter.com/CultVaultPodTumblr:\u00A0https://www.tumblr.com/blog/cultvaultReddit:\u00A0https://www.reddit.com/user/Cult-VaultGmail: cultvaultpodcast@gmail.comPatreon:\u00A0https://www.patreon.com/thecultvaultSupport this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/cultvaultpodcast/exclusive-contentAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacyThis show is part of the Spreaker Prime Network, if you are interested in advertising on this podcast, contact us at https://www.spreaker.com/show/5704277/advertisement",

Zack\u0027s activism and whistleblowing work has opened doors into institutional reform around the world - highlighting the abuse that happens in these troubled teen programmes. Zack breaks his story up by inserting perspectives from other people in Zack\u0027s life during these experiences, with his writing also peppered in research and psuedo-explanations about cults and captive organisations.Zack\u0027s website - https://www.deadinsaneorinjail.com/Crimecon UK 2022 - https://www.crimecon.co.uk/Ally Awards - https://www.cultvaultpodcast.com/about-3Troubled Teen Subreddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/troubledteens/Breaking Code Silence - https://www.breakingcodesilence.org/Get In TouchInstagram:\u00A0https://www.instagram.com/cultvaultpod/Twitter:\u00A0https://twitter.com/CultVaultPodTumblr:\u00A0https://www.tumblr.com/blog/cultvaultReddit:\u00A0https://www.reddit.com/user/Cult-VaultGmail: cultvaultpodcast@gmail.comPatreon:\u00A0https://www.patreon.com/thecultvaultSupport this podcast at \u2014 https://redcircle.com/cultvaultpodcast/exclusive-contentAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brandsPrivacy \u0026 Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacyThis show is part of the Spreaker Prime Network, if you are interested in advertising on this podcast, contact us at https://www.spreaker.com/show/5704277/advertisement",
