      "description": "Part 1 of the German TV interview for ARD - 1. program by TV journalist Peter Reichelt from Germany in Clearwater/Florida on 04. December 1998. - And thanks a lot to Mark Bunker from Clearwater. He brought the interview in 2025 to 4K quality!\n\n\u0022A hundred miles east of Los Angeles, two hours drive away. Below us is Gilman Hot Springs, the secret world headquarter of Scientology. This is where David Miscavige pulls the strings of his power. The site resembles a vacation resort. Grand houses, the golf course right next to them. Everything including the California sun. There is room for over a thousand people here, his private army. Only a few Scientologists know of this spot and its meaning. One of them, Jesse Prince, the former representative of David Miscavige, tells us what the picturesque setting conceals.\n\nPeter Reichelt (PR): Is this the headquarter of Scientology?\n\nJesse Prince: Yes.\n\nPeter Reichelt (PR): And David Miscavige lives there?\n\nJesse Prince: Yes, he lives there, yes...\n\nI was put in the RPF. It was in Happy Valley, just down the road from Gilman it is a 20 minute ride by car. You have to go through the Soboda Indian reservation and then you\u0027re there. David Miscavige assigned me, personally, because I wouldn\u0027t go along with his plan to get rid of Pat and Annie Broeker [the couple whom Hubbard had chosen to succeed him]. I refused to carry out his order. I refused to have anything to do with it, so he told me, \u0022OK, then you\u0027ll go right to the RPF.\u0022 \nThey woke me up at 5 o\u0027clock in the morning. They love this element of surprise. They brought me to a room; huddled there on the floor, crying and shaking violently was Vickie Aznaran, who, up to that time, had been David Miscavige\u0027s boss. The guards had tossed her in here and yelled at her, she was terribly afraid. Miscavige screamed at me, \u0022It\u0027s over. You had your chance. You made the wrong decision. You\u0027re going to the RPF!\u0022 Then he ordered me, \u0022Call me \u0027sir\u0027.\u0022 I will never forget that. I just looked at him and he yelled, \u0022Say it, say it, say it!\u0022 \nAnd I got up and I said, \u0022fuck you!\u0022 And I walked out of the room at which point several men tried to keep me there. But I have karate training and I knocked them down. I ran to my room to get my weapon, a semi-automatic. I still had it from Hubbard. Everybody there had weapons, semi-automatic, full automatic and .45 revolvers. I ran back to Miscavige and yelled at him, \u0022What are you going to do now?\u0022\nJesse Prince: Now David totally changed his character, he said, \u0022Jesse, you know, we\u0027ve been through so much. Please put the weapon away. Let\u0027s talk.\u0022 He did not take the weapon away from me. I put it willingly on the table. He said to me, \u0022Please accept your assignment to the camp. You are in a high position in the church, your behavior towards me has made an impression on everyone. So that Scientology does not fall apart and its authority is not destroyed, you have to go to the camp. And if you accept it, I will come and personally get you out and put you back in your old position.\u0022 I didn\u0027t believe that, but, at the time, I was convinced that it would be very bad if the entire organization fell apart because of me, so I conceded...\u0022",

      "description": "Now in 4K - The Stacy Young Interview by Peter Reichelt for German TV - 04. Dec.1998 in Clearwater about OSA and RPF\nThat is Stacy Brooks. She was a member of management of the Scientology secret service OSA and \u0022I was a puppet for over 15 years,\u0022 she said.\n\nStacy Brooks: You know you really, honestly believe, when you are a Scientologist, that it is the only route to happiness. And when you leave, you have no hope of ever being happy. You believe in this idea when you are in there, and I don\u0027t know how you can accomplish that belief. All I can do is describe it. Vaughn agreed to go back to the RPF because he truly believed that it was essential to life for him to remain a Scientologist. And this is the only way that they permit you to stay a Scientologist. For this reason people put themselves through the most humiliating, abusive and horrible experiences that you can imagine, for this deceptive and delusional idea.\n\nJesse Prince: Just like in a prison. Get up, wash, get dressed, all in ten minutes. Then you stand outside and shiver all over. In the early morning it is ice cold, everybody in a row. They count off like in jail, to make sure nobody has taken off. They tell you what your work is for that day. 20 minutes to eat and then off to the bus for work at headquarters.\n\nOff-camera commentator: In the near vicinity of the company\u0027s private golf course and the football field in Gilman Hot Sprints is another attraction in the Scientology program: a circular spot. In the middle is a palm tree. That\u0027s not meant for harmless games, that spot is for running. Today clockwise and tomorrow counter-clockwise around. The newest edition is said to be a water sprinkling system for overheated souls.\n\nJesse Prince: He put a big may pole up at his headquarters and his people had to run around it all day long. Further punishment for that part of the elite who have suddenly become a problem for David Miscavige. You run from sunrise until night, until you go to bed, always in circles, day and night, for weeks on end.\n\nStacy Brooks: Twelve hours a day around the pole, until you realize that you have done something wrong and you can think straight again. That is when you again be a proper Scientologist.",

      "description": "Jesse Prince interviewed by Chris Shelton November 10, 2018  \nChris Sheltons homepage: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF326xyA0QHI7Z5xAwKQDJg\nChris Shelton:\nThis week I interview Jesse Prince, former Scientologist and Sea Org member as well as the author of The Expert Witness, a book I reviewed a few weeks ago. Jesse worked at the highest levels of Scientology during its most turbulent and defining time directly under David Miscavige and he has some amazing stories to tell.\n\nJesse Prince and his fantastic book \u0022The Expert Witness\u0022:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Expert-Witness-Life-Top-Scientology/dp/1725992639\nJesse Prince:\nIch kam zum ersten mal mit Scientology im September 1976 in San Francisco in Ber\u00FChrung. Ende 1976 schloss ich mich der \u0022Elite Scientology Paramilitary Organisation\u0022 bekannt als Sea Organisation, ebenfalls bekannt als \u0022Sea Org\u0022. oder als die Abk\u00FCrzung \u0022SO\u0022 an. Sea Organisations Personal ist autorisiert, Scientologische Organisationen zu \u00FCbernehmen und zu kontrollieren und Personal, inklusive leitender Gesch\u00E4ftsf\u00FChrer und Anw\u00E4lte, zu degradieren bzw. zu f\u00F6rdern und die Gesellschaft zu leiten. \u0022SO\u0022 hat nicht nur die Macht \u00FCber die besagten religi\u00F6sen Scientology Organisationen, sondern ebenso herrscht die \u0022SO\u0022 \u00FCber die weltlichen Organisationen wie zum Beispiel WISE oder Bridge Publications. Bevor ich 1982 ins RTC abkommandiert wurde, hatte ich die meisten Erfahrungen mit Scientologys technischem Material, den aktuellen codierten Pr\u00FCfungs- und Verwaltungstechniken, die in der Organisation benutzt werden. Das gab mir die Zeit mich sehr mit diesem technischem Material vertraut zu machen. Das meiste davon war von Scientology Begr\u00FCnder L. Ron Hubbard geschrieben worden. Mein Wissen und meine Erfahrungen mit diesen Technologien war der Grund meiner Bef\u00F6rderung zu einer technischen Position beim RTC.\n\nIm Herbst 1982, wies L. Ron Hubbard an, den besten Supervisor/Cramming Officer unter allen Scientologen zu finden und diese Person zur Golden Era Productions (GOLD), zum trainieren der Seniormanagementstruktur zu schicken. Ein Supervisor bei Scientology ist wie ein Lehrer im Klassenraum. Ein Cramming Officer ist verantwortlich f\u00FCr die \u0022Korrektur\u0022 aller Leute, die Differenzen mit der Ausf\u00FChrung der Techniken von Dianetics und Scientology haben oder auch dem Dogma zu folgen. Mike Eldridge, ein pers\u00F6nlicher Abgesandter von L. Ron Hubbard , mit der Leitung der Suche der bestqualifiziertesten Personen zum Supervisor/Cramming Officer beauftragt, empfahl mich David Miscavige, der zum Schluss meiner Ernennung zustimmte. Ich wurde in die sogenannten \u0022Gold Era Studios\u0022, in der N\u00E4he von Hemet, Kalifornien transportiert um dort zu leben und zu arbeiten.  Es ist auch bekannt als \u0022Gold\u0022 oder einfach nur die \u0022Basis\u0022, wo das Hauptquartier des Seniormanagement beheimatet ist.\n\nVom Scientologischem Standard gesehen, war ich ein sehr hoch trainierter Pr\u00FCfer. Bei Scientology gibt es 12 Stufen von Pr\u00FCfern und Aufsichtspersonen, jede Stufe ist h\u00F6her als die andere. In diesem System wurde ich in die Klasse 9 eingestuft.  In meiner Position als Stv. GenIn. Ex, reiste ich in und ausserhalb der Vereinigten Staaten im Namen von RTC. Ich reiste nach Deutschland, Italien, Australien, Grossbritannien, D\u00E4nemark, Mexiko und Kanada. Diese Reisen waren dazu da, eine Infrastruktur  zusammenzustellen, die den Zweck hatte den Handel durchzusetzen.\n\nIch habe Erfahrungen mit den Patentrechten der verschiedenen L\u00E4nder in die ich reiste. Ich interviewete und st\u00FCtze Anwaltskanzleien, und setzte Personal an die Stellen, von denen aus sie RTC Report geben konnten. Ich war als Experte, Zeuge f\u00FCr Scientologische Technologien im Auftrag des RTC im Gericht von Los Angeles, 1985. 1983 auf Anordnung von L. Ron Hubbard, gr\u00FCndete ich eine Einheit genannt \u0022Tech Unit\u0022 mit dem RTC. Die \u0022Tech Unit\u0022 war verpflichtet die \u0022PC-Akten\u0022 auch \u0022Pre-Clear- Akten\u0022 genannt in allen Scientologischen Organisationen zu inspizieren und sicherzustellen. Die \u0022Tech Unit\u0022 stimmte 100 % mit dem \u0022Standard Tech\u0022 \u00FCberein.\n\nAls Hubbard 1986 starb, gab es einen Machtkampf bei Scientology f\u00FCr ungef\u00E4hr die n\u00E4chsten 18 Monate, wobei Hubbard bester und engster Freund (Pat Broeker) bei Scientology ausgeschlossen wurde. Die totale Kontrolle wurde von David Miscavige \u00FCbernommen, welcher die Organisation nach jedem der zu Broeker hielt absuchte und diesen entfernen liess. Weil ich nicht Teil eines von Miscaviges Machtkampf werden wollte, wurde ich meiner Position enthoben und unter Beaufsichtigung nach Happy Valley, angesiedelt tief in der W\u00FCste hinter dem Soboba Indianerreservat gebracht.",

Dezember 1998)\n\nDie TV-Dokumentation \u0022Inside Scientology\u0022 aus der TV Reihe \u0022Investigative Reports\u0022 des US-Senders A\u0026E bietet einen umfassenden Einblick in die Strukturen, Praktiken und Kontroversen der Scientology-Organisation in den 1990er Jahren. Moderiert wird sie von Bill Kurtis.\n\nIn der A\u0026E-Dokumentation \u201EInside Scientology\u201C wird die Rolle prominenter Mitglieder als Aush\u00E4ngeschilder der Sekte ausf\u00FChrlich beleuchtet \u2013 Namen wie Tom Cruise und John Travolta stehen dabei im Rampenlicht. Doch auch der \u00F6sterreichische K\u00FCnstler Gottfried Helnwein ist seit Jahrzehnten eng mit der Scientology-Sekte verbunden und fungiert als einer der wichtigsten europ\u00E4ischen Prominenten im Dienste der Organisation.\nHelnwein, international bekannt f\u00FCr seine verst\u00F6renden Darstellungen verletzter Kinder, wurde bereits 1972 Mitglied von Scientology und hat im Laufe der Jahre h\u00F6chste Fantasietitel der Sekte erworben: \u201EOperierender Thetan\u201C, \u201EAuditor IV\u201C und \u201EPatron\u201C \u2013 letzteres ein Status, der Gro\u00DFspendern vorbehalten ist, die die Kriegskasse der Organisation mitfinanzieren. In offiziellen Scientology-Publikationen wird Helnwein als Vorbild pr\u00E4sentiert, da er die Kunstvorstellungen des Sektengr\u00FCnders L. Ron Hubbard musterg\u00FCltig umsetzt und dessen Lehren \u00FCber Kinder als \u201Egeistige Wesen\u201C in seinen Werken widerspiegelt.\nSeine jahrzehntelange N\u00E4he zur F\u00FChrungsriege der Sekte ist belegt: Helnwein pflegte enge Kontakte zum Scientology-Geheimdienst OSA und nahm an Strategietreffen mit f\u00FChrenden OSA-Funktion\u00E4ren wie Mike Rinder und Klaus B\u00FCchele teil. Laut Aussteigerberichten war Helnwein der wichtigste deutschsprachige Scientologe und wurde gezielt in den Kampf gegen Kritiker und die deutsche Regierung eingebunden.\nTrotz dieser engen Verbindungen versucht Helnwein, sein Verh\u00E4ltnis zur Sekte \u00F6ffentlich im Unklaren zu lassen \u2013 ein kalkuliertes Spiel mit der eigenen Biografie, das immer wieder zu Skandalen und Ausstellungsabsagen f\u00FChrte, etwa im Wiener Stephansdom oder bei deutschen Ausstellungen. W\u00E4hrend die Sekte ihn als prominentes Aush\u00E4ngeschild feiert, bleibt sein k\u00FCnstlerisches Werk untrennbar mit den Lehren und der Propaganda von Scientology verwoben \u2013 ein weiteres Beispiel f\u00FCr die perfide Verzahnung von Macht, Manipulation und \u00F6ffentlicher Inszenierung, wie sie \u201EInside Scientology\u201C aufdeckt.",

This may include members who are deemed to have hidden evil intentions towards Scientology, members who are unproductive in their work or who produce poor-quality work.\n\nThe program includes manual labor tasks and the study of L. Ron Hubbard\u0027s works. The rehabilitation program may take more than a year to complete, and the Church has been accused of overworking and mistreating its participants.[2][3][4] Scholars, journalists, and former scientologists have characterized the RPF as a forced labor and re-indoctrination program comparable to the Soviet gulag system.\n\nThe Rehabilitation Project Force developed out of a predecessor group, the Mud Box Brigade, which was formed aboard L. Ron Hubbard\u0027s private fleet in the late 1960s.[5]:\u200A125\u200A[a] The mud box is a small perforated screening box fitted to the suction pipe in the bilge of a ship, and is designed to catch larger solid waste before it can choke the pipeline and potentially damage the pump. The Mud Box Brigade was assigned to clean out the mud box as well as fuel lines, water lines, bilges and other parts of the fleet\u0027s ships.[6]:\u200A341\u200A\n\nHubbard defined the role as being essentially a punishment duty for unsatisfactory workers: \u0022More candidates will be appointed regularly and promptly every time I find a freeloader who is loafing on post and drifting with the wind.\u0022[6]:\u200A349\u200A Hubbard later clarified that \u0022(T)his group is the most downstat [unproductive] and one gets assigned to it by being a freeloader, invisible on post, loafing and really goofing up on one\u0027s job.\u0022[6]:\u200A341\u200A\n\nIn 1969, Hubbard replaced the Mud Box Brigade with the Rehabilitation Unit, again intended for those removed or disciplined \u0022as ineffective or trouble.\u0022 Following an evaluation, the individual was to receive a set of \u0022specific recommendations which if followed will rehabilitate the individual as a highly effective and worthwhile Sea Org member.\u0022 Hubbard instructed that \u0022(T)he unit is [to be] worked hard during the day on a rigorous schedule on jobs assigned by the Review Chief handling corrective areas and jobs needing remedy and repair. The Unit itself is thus made into an effective ship\u0027s review team. It works on a one job, one time, one place formula completing each job before moving into the next. Each individual thus earns the right to the remedial services he or she will receive.\u0022[6]:\u200A341\u200A\n\nIn January 1974, the Rehabilitation Unit was replaced with the Rehabilitation Project Force, or RPF. According to Hubbard, \u0022the RPF has been created by the Commodore [Hubbard] so that redemption can occur. That is basically its only purpose.\u0022 He identified four categories of people who were to be assigned to the RPF: \u0022rockslammers\u0022 (people deemed to have hidden evil intentions, as detected by the E-meter); people who were unproductive and scored poorly on the Oxford Capacity Analysis personality test; \u0022repeated stat crashers\u0022, people who were held responsible for declines in Scientology organizations\u0027 productivity; and \u0022overt product makers\u0022, people who produced poor-quality work. As before, the unit was to work on \u0022one job, one place, one time.\u0022 A five-hour study period was to be implemented each day to improve the individuals\u0027 knowledge of Scientology.[7]",

      "description": "Why Tom Cruise unleashed at Channel Nine presenter Peter Overton: \u0027What an infuriating person\u0027\nOverton, one of Australia\u0027s most well-known presenters, has reflected on the 2005 interview, saying he\u0027ll \u0027never forget it\u0027.\n\n\u0027That was a hell of an interview, I\u0027ll never forget it,\u0027 Overton told Nine last year.\n\n\u0027I held my own and I was happy about that. I didn\u0027t change, that\u0027s who I am. I thought they were fair questions.\u0027\n\nMany Tom Cruise fans were not impressed with Overton\u0027s line of questioning/\n\n\u0027He was definitely stepping over the line,\u0027 one said. \n\n\u0027I thought Tom Cruise handled the whole thing pretty well. He came across as a fair-minded and well grounded and reasonable guy, but also one who won\u0027t put up with garbage,\u0027 a second said.\n\n\u0027The interviewer was trying to antagonise Tom to get a response out of him. What an infuriating person,\u0027 a third said.\n\n\u0027Tom did a good job in refraining himself from smacking his mouth,\u0027 a fourth said.\n\nCruise was pictured in Sydney over the weekend promoting his new film Mission Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One.\n\nIn the movie, the actor performs one of his most dangerous stunts yet - driving a motorcycle off a cliff and then parachuting to the bottom of a mountain. \nThe wild moment Tom Cruise tells Peter Overton to \u0027put his manners back in\u0027 over a question about his ex-wife Nicole Kidman has resurfaced as the Hollywood star turns to Australia to promote his new movie.\n\nCruise, now 60, accused Overton of \u0027crossing over a line\u0027 when he asked the actor about his relationship with Kidman four years after their divorce.\n\nCruise and Kidman separated in 2001 after 12 years of marriage amid rumours his commitment to Scientology had driven a wedge between them.\n\nThe couple adopted two children, daughter Isabella Jane in 1992 and son Connor Antony in 1995, but never had any biological children.\n\nIn the 2005 interview for 60 Minutes, Overton asks if Nicole was the love of his life.\n\n\u0027I love Nic very much, there\u0027s no question,\u0027 Cruise replied.\n\n\u0027And do you have a relationship where you talk, it\u0027s a parenting relationship, and talk professionally about each other\u0027s work?\u0027 Overton pressed.\n\n\u0027Listen, here\u0027s the thing Peter,\u0027 an unimpressed Cruise cuts in.\n\n\u0027You\u0027re stepping over a line now, you know you are.\u0027\n\nOverton tries to tell the actor that his questions are \u0027what people want to know\u0027.\n\n\u0027Peter. You want to know. Take responsibility for what you want to know,\u0027 Cruise says. \n\n\u0027Don\u0027t say \u0022what other people\u0022. This is a conversation I\u0027m having with you right now. So I\u0027m just telling you right now. Just put your manners back in.\u0027\n\n\u0027Do you think I was out of line?\u0027 a slightly bemused Overton replies. \n\n\u0027Yes, absolutely,\u0027 Cruise hits back. \n\nOverton \u0027apologises sincerely\u0027 for the question and the interview continues. \n\nCommunication Professor Alexander Lyon said the tone of the interview changed after Overton asked Cruise if Nicole had been the love of his life. \n\n\u0027He clearly didn\u0027t want to spend the interview talking about his ex-wife,\u0027 he said.  \n\nProfessor Lyon said Cruise had displayed two assertive behaviours to signal to Overton that he had crossed a line. \n\nFirst, the actor took a deep breath, pauses, and looks off to the side. \n\n\u0027The signal of discomfort has to show Peter that he\u0027s bumped up against something that Tom doesn\u0027t want to talk about,\u0027 he explained. \n\n\u0027Next, instead of answering the question, Tom asks two questions of his own.\u0027\n\nHe then shows a clip of Cruise asking the interviewer: \u0027What do you mean Peter? I mean, how do you even answer that question?\u0027\n\nThe communications coach said these questions were a great way to communicate boundaries, by holding the other person to account. \n\n\u0027I have to agree with Tom\u0027s approach here. Peter is pushing into some pretty personal territory and Tom is there to promote a movie. \n\n\u0027He has no obligation to talk about how much he loved his ex-wife or not.\u0027\n\nOverton, one of Australia\u0027s most well-known presenters, has reflected on the 2005 interview, saying he\u0027ll \u0027never forget it\u0027.\n\n\u0027That was a hell of an interview, I\u0027ll never forget it,\u0027 Overton told Nine last year.\n\n\u0027I held my own and I was happy about that.

Nun soll er in Wien ein Museum bekommen. Zurecht? \n\nJuli 2024 - Das \u00F6sterreichische Wochenmagazin FALTER-PORTR\u00C4T von Kultur-Chef MATTHIAS DUSINI/Wien \n\nDer Name Helnwein rauscht durch die Kan\u00E4le. Da die Aufregung \u00FCber eine \u00F6sterliche Intervention im Stephansdom, in Gmunden Emp\u00F6rung \u00FCber Transparente, die blutverschmierte M\u00E4dchen zeigen. Der Standard erinnert an seine Verbindungen zur Scientology-Sekte. \nDie Albertina widmete Gottfried Helnwein \u2013 Markenzeichen: schwarze Kleidung, Sonnenbrille, Haartuch \u2013 unl\u00E4ngst eine Retrospektive. Und nun soll der 75-J\u00E4hrige im Zentrum Wiens auch noch ein eigenes Museum bekommen. \nDamit sein Werk auch nach seinem Tod zug\u00E4nglich gemacht werden kann, will Helnwein eine Stiftung gr\u00FCnden. In Interviews weist er darauf hin, dass Politiker seine Idee unterst\u00FCtzten, etwa der Ex-Landeshauptmann von Nieder\u00F6sterreich Erwin Pr\u00F6ll oder Ex-Kanzler Sebastian Kurz. \nHelnweins Wunsch nach Unsterblichkeit und die Begeisterung einiger Politiker f\u00FChrten zum Projekt Helnweineum. Die positive Energie strahlt aus allen politischen Lagern. So besch\u00E4ftigt sich die kommunale, rote Wien Holding mit dem Plan. \u201CEr hat sein Vorhaben pr\u00E4sentiert und wir pr\u00FCfen, ob das ohne F\u00F6rderungen m\u00F6glich ist\u201D, kommentiert deren Sprecher.  \nAls m\u00F6gliche Liegenschaft wird das Veranstaltungszentrum der Akademie der Wissenschaften genannt, das in die Zust\u00E4ndigkeit des schwarzen Wissenschaftsministeriums f\u00E4llt.

Neben dem Investor Alexander Sch\u00FCtz bekennt sich der Immobilienmann Klemens Hallmann zu ihm. Hallmann und Helnwein erwarben gemeinsam das Barockschloss Ruegers im nieder\u00F6sterreichischen Riegersburg. Mit von der Partie auch Superfund-Gr\u00FCnder Alexander Baha, der die Albertina-Schau mit Leihgaben best\u00FCckte. \nWas spricht gegen den Plan, \u00D6sterreichs bekanntestem Maler ein eigenes Haus zu widmen? Um den Meister beurteilen zu k\u00F6nnen, lohnt ein Blick auf seinen Werdegang, der vom Hippie zum Malerf\u00FCrst f\u00FChrte.

      "description": "Part 1 - Scientology Investigative - Fredy Gareis Undercover in Berlin - German RTL Stern TV 2008\nFredy Gareis: Journalist und Undercover-Rechercheur\nFredy Gareis (geb. 1971) ist ein deutscher Journalist und Buchautor, der insbesondere f\u00FCr investigative Reportagen und Undercover-Recherchen bekannt ist. Er arbeitete unter anderem f\u00FCr das Magazin stern und ver\u00F6ffentlichte zahlreiche kritische Berichte zu gesellschaftlichen, politischen und religi\u00F6sen Themen.\nUndercover bei Scientology: Thorsten Brock alias Fredy Gareis\nIm Rahmen einer gro\u00DFangelegten Recherche f\u00FCr den stern schl\u00FCpfte Fredy Gareis 2007/2008 unter dem Decknamen Thorsten Brock f\u00FCr f\u00FCnf Monate in die Rolle eines Scientology-Interessierten. Ziel war es, aus erster Hand zu erfahren, wie die Organisation neue Mitglieder anwirbt, wie Kurse ablaufen und wie Scientologen auf pers\u00F6nliche Krisen reagieren.\nAblauf der Recherche\nEinstieg: Gareis meldete sich unter falschem Namen in der Scientology-Ortsgruppe Berlin an. Er gab vor, unzufrieden mit seinem Leben und offen f\u00FCr neue Wege zu sein.\nKurse und Auditing: Er nahm an zahlreichen Einf\u00FChrungs- und Aufbaukursen teil, darunter sogenannte \u201EAuditings\u201C (seelische Beratungen), die zentraler Bestandteil der Scientology-Lehre sind.\nBeobachtungen: Gareis dokumentierte, wie Kursleiter auf pers\u00F6nliche Probleme eingingen, wie Mitglieder zur Selbstreflexion angeleitet wurden und wie schnell neue Teilnehmer in das System eingebunden wurden.\nKosten: Er stellte fest, dass nahezu alle Kurse und Beratungen kostenpflichtig sind und dass Mitglieder bei Zahlungsproblemen oder Terminverst\u00F6\u00DFen unter Druck gesetzt werden.\nAusstieg: Nach Abschluss der Recherche beendete Gareis seine Mitgliedschaft und ver\u00F6ffentlichte seine Erfahrungen.\nErgebnisse und Ver\u00F6ffentlichungen\nstern-Reportage: Die Ergebnisse erschienen 2008 im stern unter dem Titel \u201EUndercover bei Scientology\u201C. Gareis beschrieb detailliert die Abl\u00E4ufe, Methoden und die Atmosph\u00E4re innerhalb der Organisation.\nBuchver\u00F6ffentlichung: Die Recherche wurde sp\u00E4ter in Buchform ver\u00F6ffentlicht und sorgte f\u00FCr gro\u00DFes Medienecho.\nTV-Beitr\u00E4ge: Gareis berichtete auch in Fernsehbeitr\u00E4gen \u00FCber seine Erfahrungen, etwa in Form von Interviews und Dokumentationen.\nReaktionen und Kontroversen\nScientology: Die Organisation warf Gareis vor, seine Rechercheergebnisse zu verzerren und Aussagen aus dem Zusammenhang zu rei\u00DFen.

      "description": "30. 9.2020 - Deutscher Verfassungsschutz: \u0022Scientology is a global conglomerate with clear, uncompromising extremist goals and infiltration strategies.\u0022\n \nLadies and gentlemen,\nI\u2019d like to welcome you to today\u2019s press conference, where we are presenting the new short film \u201CTen Tips on How Not to Get Fooled-Today by Scientologists\u201D and the updated edition of the brochure \u201CThe Scientology System.\u201D\n\nHere\u2019s today\u2019s agenda:\nFirst, we\u2019ll hear a speech from State Minister Joachim Herrmann.\nNext, Dr. Burkhard K\u00F6rner, President of the State Office for the Protection of the Constitution, will deliver a statement.\nAfterwards, we\u2019ll watch a four-minute short film, and then, as usual, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to ask questions.\nMinister Herrmann, the floor is yours.\n\nMinister Herrmann:\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. I am pleased to present, together with the State Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the updated brochure \u201CThe Scientology System\u201D and the new short film \u201CTen Tips on How Not to Get Fooled-This Time by Scientologists.\u201D Both are important educational tools.\nThe threat posed by the Scientology organization to our society is significant, even if it sometimes fades from public awareness amid other grave dangers like right-wing extremist attacks, international Islamist terrorism, or rising left-wing violence.\nUnlike other extremist groups, Scientology prefers to operate under the public radar. Their activities aren\u2019t focused on physical violence, but rather on conditioning individuals to submit unconditionally to the Scientology system. Through this, they seek total control over their followers, tolerating neither private secrets nor relationships with anyone critical of the organization.\nScientology promises its members that, by following \u201Cthe Bridge to Total Freedom,\u201D they\u2019ll become superhuman with paranormal abilities. In reality, people are drawn into a sophisticated system of psychological manipulation, ultimately finding themselves in a totalitarian organization that exploits them financially and drives them into mental dependency and social isolation.\nScientology\u2019s dangers are not just individual-they threaten society as a whole. The organization promotes its own definition of fundamental and human rights, which has nothing to do with the rights guaranteed by our constitution. Internally and externally, Scientology aims for a society functioning according to its totalitarian rules.\n\nThese examples show that Scientology is adept at leveraging current issues to spread its message to specific groups. Thanks to persistent educational work by our State Office, the number of Scientology members in Bavaria has remained steady at around 1,200. Among them are many young people raised in Scientology families-the so-called \u201CGeneration 2.0\u201D-who have internalized the ideology and rarely question it. Scientology sees these successful young members as ideal ambassadors to attract new recruits.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that we, as a state, continue to counter these dangerous developments and diverse activities with determination. I am therefore very pleased that our educational outreach continues with two new formats. For over 20 years, the brochure \u201CThe Scientology System\u201D has informed the public about the dangers posed by Scientology\u2019s ideology, with over 70,000 copies distributed, making it one of the most requested information brochures from the Bavarian Office for the Protection of the Constitution.\nThe new edition informs readers about Scientology\u2019s ideology, its recruitment strategies, internal hierarchy, and tactics against defectors and critics.\nThe second format is the new short film \u201CTen Tips on How Not to Get Fooled-This Time by Scientologists.\u201D This is the latest in a series of six educational films, covering topics from fake news to extremism. The new film highlights Scientology\u2019s strategies for targeting young people and binding them to the organization so tightly that life outside seems impossible or undesirable. \n\nThank you, Dr. K\u00F6rner, and your team at the State Office for your continued vigilance-not only against violent extremism but also against the quieter threat posed by Scientology.\nDr. K\u00F6rner:\nThank you, Minister Herrmann, for your kind words and your trust in our agency.\nThe Bavarian State Office for the Protection of the Constitution has been monitoring the Scientology organization since 1996. We have consistently warned about the dangers posed by Scientology in Bavaria, especially the risk of underestimating the group. It must not be dismissed as a fringe problem or mistaken for a harmless group of religiously motivated activists.\nScientology is a global conglomerate with clear, uncompromising extremist goals and infiltration strategies. It has a highly committed ideological base and aggressively targets its opponents. At the end of the day, Scientology is about ruthless profit maximization.",

Church officials say its enemies are out to destroy the organizations.\n\nCastile Canyon School\nIn the early 1980s, the Church of Scientology bought the Castile Canyon School adjacent to the Soboba Indian Reservation east of San Jacinto. It was opened as a boarding school in 1992 for children whose parents work at the Gilman Hot Springs complex.\n\nThe school is hidden from the public eye and not easily accessible. Motorists must drive through the reservation and take a long road owned by the church to get to the campus, which has a gate in front.\n\nScientologists say it\u0027s the perfect place to educate children, who live, work, study and play as a community.\n\nChurch critics say it\u0027s the perfect place to imprison members who have misbehaved or gone astray.\n\nThe German journalists Peter Reichelt and Ina Brockmann were approaching the entrance of the Scientology prison camp known as the RPF \u0022Castile Canyon School,\u0022 also referred to as \u0022INT Ranch\u0022 or \u0022Happy Valley.\u0022\nWhen they were just two miles away from the camp\u0027s entrance, an incident occurred. A short time later, only a mile from the entrance, they were subjected to \u0022false imprisonment.\u0022\n\nFalse imprisonment of the German TV journalists for ARD First program Peter Reichelt and Ina Brockmann after their helicopter flight to find the rpf prison camp \u201Ehappy valley\u201C near the scientology world headquarter GOLD in Gilman Hot Springs/California by air, where david miscavige lives, to find the for years vanished German wiebke hansen from Hamburg.\n\nThe 2 German TV investigative journalists get followed on their way to the prison camp 1 hour after leaving the helicopter airport near palms springs by a loadfull of scientology secret service cars, led by ken hoden, the boss of GOLD. \n\nThe Scientology OSA secret service agents finally got stopped the 2 German TV journalists roughly on an open public street only 1 mile before reaching the Scientology OSA and rpf labour camp entrance, only for Sea Org members, \u2026 see what happened\u2026\n\nSome church opponents in Germany, where Scientology is under intense scrutiny for alleged civil-rights abuses, say they suspect Wiebke Hansen, the former head of the group\u0027s church in Hamburg, is being held at the school against her will.\n\nIn March, German television journalists Peter Reichelt and Ina Brockmann came to investigate. They were placed under citizen\u0027s arrest by Scientology guards after they tried to get onto the property. They, in turn, made a citizen\u0027s arrest of the Scientologists, alleging false imprisonment. The cases were forwarded to the Riverside County district attorney\u0027s office, but no charges were filed.\n\n\u0022This is something we don\u0027t need to use the criminal venue to take care of . . . This is better taken care of in civil court,\u0022 said Assistant District Attorney Randy Tagami.\n\nDeputy DA Alina Freer said she inspected the school and film studios and found no evidence that people were being held against their will. She said Reichelt never mentioned Hansen by name.\n\n\u0022It appeared to be a private school and studio that is fully operational. I asked to see a lot of it. I saw the kids\u0027 dorm rooms.\n\nThere was not a building left unturned,\u0022 she said.\n\nReichelt said Scientology officials at the Hamburg mission told him Hansen is being held at the school for rehabilitation. He said Hoden of Golden Era Productions confirmed her whereabouts during the standoff...",

Until now, there was hardly any information about it. And certainly no pictures. The Mannheim TV journalist Peter Reichelt has succeeded in tracking down reformatories, so-called RPF\u0027s (Rehabilitation Project Forces) of the Scientology group.\nBy our reporter ANTON NOTZ \nTwo hours by car from Los Angeles, in a desert-like landscape, lies \u0022Happy Valley.\u0022 David Miscavage, the head of Scientology, has built an empire nearby that is as luxurious as it is mysterious. In \u0022Happy Valley,\u0022 however, things are different than in Club Med. Around 100 people from the elite Sea-Org unit have to do their penance here. \u0022The people are real prisoners. They are absolutely not there voluntarily,\u0022 says Gerry Armstrong, ex-coordinator of the Scientology secret service OSA, who says he spent two and a half years in penal camps. \nJesse Prince, formerly the second man in the Scientology leadership behind Miscavage, tells Reichelt on camera what goes on behind barbed wire and video-monitored walls. The camp internees have to work day and night like slaves. Prince also speaks from his own experience. He went through Happy Valley for disobeying orders. \u0022It was absolutely horrible. I slept in a chicken coop on the floor, rattlesnakes and scorpions all around me.\u0022 Hard labor, forced hypnosis, brainwashing - according to dropouts, these are the methods Scientology uses to bring \u0022doubters and failures\u0022 back in line. Not all, but those who are significant for the organization because they know too much or are an important cog in the world-spanning money machine. \nHow one has to rehabilitate oneself in a penal camp in Copenhagen is described by a once high-ranking Scientologist thus: No newspaper, no radio, talking to no one, eating everyone else\u0027s garbage, always working. Everyone is watching everyone else. With \u0022knowledge reports\u0022 one blackens the others. The Californian penal camp inside Miscavage\u0027s golden cage has another special feature, which Peter Reichelt discovered during a flight over the area: the \u0022track. Jesse Prince explains: Here, some \u0022deadbeats\u0022 run around a pole for twelve hours in order to become decent Scientologists again. \nPrince has freed himself from the clutches of the cult group. After numerous death threats, he lives separately from his family to protect them. Peter Reichelt and his colleague Ina Brockmann, who were forcibly detained by Scientology members on the open street during filming, have meanwhile completed a film that will be broadcast today at 10:45 p.m. on S\u00FCdwest 3.\nKapitel\n\nAlle ansehen\nTranskript\nDu kannst im Transkript mitlesen.\n\n\nTranskript anzeigen\n\nXENU TV\n40.000 Abonnenten\nVideos\nKanalinfo",

      "description": "2024: Helnwein - The OSA Spy: Austrian Artist Gottfried Helnwein Was Outed As A Longtime Scientology OSA Secret Service Spy By Former OSA Germany And Austria Executive Director For The OSA Secret Service Klaus B\u00FCchele\n\nThe Thumbnail Shows Both Nearest Scientology Friends Priscilla Presley and Gottfried Helnwein Together in Vienna/Austria on February 7, 2024\n\nTony Ortega About Former Scientology OSA Agent Klaus B\u00FCchele and Gottfried Helnwein interviewed by Peter Reichelt in 2024\n\nInterview Peter Reichelt with Klaus B\u00FCchele Part 1:\n\nhttps://tonyortega.substack.com/p/he-was-i...\n\nPart 2:\n\nhttps://tonyortega.substack.com/p/he-was-i...\n\nHere are parts of the intensive 2024 interview between Klaus B\u00FCchele and journalist Peter Reichelt:\n\nKlaus: ... I had more to do with Mike Rinder because the German Task Force also did a lot of public relations work.\n\nPeter: So propaganda for Scientology against Germany?\n\nKlaus: Yes, against Germany. Gottfried Helnwein was also embedded and active in our campaign.\n\nPeter: Helnwein was probably very, very important. He\u2019s been a Scientologist for 50 years.\n\nKlaus: Yes, but the importance of celebrities was not based on the number of years in Scientology, but on how much money you have and which important personalities you know and what influence you have on them. And if Helnwein has a lot of connections to politicians, or because he paints a lot of famous people, then of course he is very important for OSA because he can open a lot of doors for us. He has done that. But if you\u2019re a famous singer, for example, who has nothing to do with politicians, then it doesn\u2019t matter how long you\u2019ve been in Scientology. But then you are not interesting for OSA.\n\nPeter: But Helnwein also helped plan the big campaign against Germany, or at least he played a leading role in it. He appeared in Washington for OSA and testified there against Germany as an allegedly \u201Cpersecuted Scientologist,\u201D that he was being persecuted in Germany, etc. That must have been precisely coordinated with someone in OSA at the time.\n\nKlaus: Yes, absolutely right. That was agreed with Leisa Goodman and Mike Rinder back in 1996 and 1997. And partly also with Kurt Weiland. So not with me directly, I was only marginally involved. Of course I was involved in everything.\n\nPeter: You were the head of the, what is it called? You were the German Task Force In Charge in OSA International, you were the boss of the whole operation against Germany and Austria. How did you come to this high position, Germany Task Force In Charge OSA Int, that you became the boss of this extensive action in 1994? Whose idea was it? Did Miscavige personally have the idea to conduct this huge campaign against Germany?\n\nKlaus: I can\u2019t remember exactly who came up with the idea. It must have been Miscavige, Marty Rathbun, and Mike Rinder, that\u2019s just how it was. We had to do something big about Germany...\nThe campaign against Germany went on over two years under my leadership, I think. And then it was disbanded. I was actually against it ending because I had the feeling that we were making good progress. Mike Rinder informed me of the dissolution of the task force, \n\nI think in 1995/1996. That was when Gottfried Helnwein was with us in Los Angeles at the HGB for a meeting. We took Helnwein, Mike Rinder and I, to the airport in LAX after the OSA meeting and on the way back to the HGB I was alone in the car with Mike and he told me that \u201Cmy\u201D Germany Task Force was to be dissolved. It was to be integrated into the normal OSA organization. Then I said, that\u2019s nonsense, we\u2019re making great progress. But Rinder said the decision had been made and then I went back to the OSA legal office for a few months. That must have been at the end of 1996. So the task force existed for about 2 years.\n\nPeter: Why did you personally take Helnwein to the airport in Los Angeles?\n\nKlaus: He was in the HGB (the Office of Special Affairs World Headquarter) at the time.\n\nPeter: You discussed with him what his future role in the fight against Germany should be?\n\nKlaus: Yes, of course. That was the purpose of meeting with him, that was always the purpose. Who do you know? What can you do for us? Who do you know in Washington D.C.? And then he\u2019ll just tell us everything, who he knows where and how he can help. And that\u2019s how he practically becomes an OSA man.\n\nPeter: Then Helnwein was an OSA man for many years.\n\nKlaus: Yes, that\u2019s right. You could say that. Regardless of whether he has a contract with OSA or not, he has always worked for OSA. If he has an assignment like that, from me or from Linda Hamel, then of course we expect him to call us daily, or at least weekly, but more likely daily when it comes to important meetings, for example in Washington D.C., that he then calls us in the evening and reports back. \n\nSo in this respect, he is completely an OSA man.\n\nBack then, I had a lot to do in Germany and could do what I wanted because I was solely responsible for the whole project.",

In realizing just how deep the rabbit hole of manipulation and deceit of Scientology was, Chris created videos outlining how Scientology works.

      "description": "In 2000, four Scientologists who had reached the level of OT VII (Peter Alexander, Tory Christman and Greg \u0026 Debra Barnes) sat down to discuss the difficulties they faced on Scientology\u0027s upper levels.\n\nRemastered by great Mark Bunker for a new generation in 4K! \n\nMark Bunker Exposing Scientology Fraud and Abuse through streaming video.\n\nmarkbunker@gmail.com\nwww.youtube.com/@XENUTV\n39.700 Abonnenten\n499 Videos\n11.697.407 Aufrufe\nAm 15.03.2006 beigetreten\nVereinigte Staaten\n\nPeter Alexander:\nBanned film \u0027The Profit\u0027 appears on Web\n\nSunday, March 23, 2008\n\nCopies of The Profit, a 2001 film blocked from distribution in the United States due to a court injunction won by the Church of Scientology, appeared on the Internet Friday on peer-to-peer file-sharing websites and on the video sharing site YouTube.\n\nDirected by former film executive Peter N. Alexander, the movie has been characterized by critics as a parody of Scientology and of its founder L. Ron Hubbard. Alexander was a Scientologist for twenty years, and left the organization in 1997. The film was funded by Bob Minton, a former critic of Scientology who later signed an agreement with the Church of Scientology and has attempted to stop distribution of the film. Alexander has stated that the movie is based on his research into cults, and when asked by the St. Petersburg Times about parallels to Scientology and L. Ron Hubbard said: \u0022I\u0027ll let you draw that conclusion ... I say it\u0027s entirely fictional.\u0022\nThe film was released in August 2001, and was shown at a movie theatre in Clearwater, Florida and at a premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in France. A Scientology spokesman gave a statement at the time saying \u0022the movie is fiction and has nothing to do with Scientology\u0022. The Church of Scientology later took legal action in an attempt to stop further distribution of the film. The Church of Scientology claimed that the film was intended to influence the jury pool in the wrongful death case of Scientologist Lisa McPherson, who died under Scientology care in Clearwater, Florida.\nIn an October 2007 article, The Times described the film as \u0022banned in the US because of a lawsuit taken out against it by The Church of Scientology,\u0022 and Russ Kick\u0027s The Disinformation Book of Lists included the film in his \u0022List of 16 Movies Banned in the U.S.\u0022. An 8-minute teaser segment from The Profit appeared on the film\u0027s website and on the video sharing site YouTube in February 2008, and an attorney representing Bob Minton sent a letter to Luke Lirot requesting that the film clip be taken down. In a response letter, Lirot wrote that \u0022Rather than damage any asset of the LLC, the short clip merely keeps the film in the public eye, and in a positive way.\u0022\n\nOn Saturday, Scientology critic and Emmy award-winning journalist Mark Bunker put a streaming version of the film on his website, www.xenutv.com, and encouraged others to watch and discuss the film on a real-time chat channel. In a video posting to YouTube Saturday, Bunker said \u0022I did not do it. I had nothing to do with it ... I had nothing to do with this release at all. But I\u0027m happy it\u0027s out there ... people are finally having a chance to see it. A lot of people have been curious over the years and there\u0027s been a lot of interest in seeing the film, so finally you can.\u0022\n\n...",

He is also is best friends with his That 70\u0027s Show costars, Ashton Kutcher \u0026 Mila Kunis. Masterson may look to be another typical Hollywood celebrity, but behind the scenes he was attacking a large amount of women, many more than you\u2019ve heard about in the mainstream media. Danny Masterson, along with his siblings Chris Masterson \u0026 Alanna Masterson, is a lifelong member of the Church of Scientology. This case has had a lot of publicity because of the celebrities attached to it but unless you have been following this trial day after day from the people who were in court and following it all extremely closely, I think you\u2019ll be surprised by what really went on. The investigation took over seven years, and Leah Remini even put out a special episode of Leah Remini: Scientology \u0026 the Aftermath, covering Masterson\u0027s attacks on multiple women. This video will go over everything about Masterson, the accusations, trial, outcome, aftermath and more. Let me know your thoughts in the comments and a huge thank you to \u202A@GrowingUpInScientology\u202C who attended the Danny Masterson trial everyday and provided live updates throughout the trial.\n\u2714 Social Media - AshSilverInvestigates \n  / ashsilverinvestigates   - Coffee \u0026 Cults Insta\n\nAshton Kutcher, Mila Kunis Wrote Letters in Support of Danny Masterson Ahead of Rape Sentencing; Kutcher Called Him a \u2018Role Model\u2019\nAshton Kutcher and Mila Kunis were two of more than 50 people who wrote to the judge in the Danny Masterson sexual assault trial to support the convicted actor ahead of his sentencing, per court documents obtained by Variety.\n\nKutcher and Kunis, who are married and share two young children, starred with Masterson on Fox\u2019s sitcom \u201CThat \u201970s Show,\u201D which ran for eight seasons and 200 episodes between 1998 and 2006. Kutcher then starred with Masterson on Netflix\u2019s \u201CThe Ranch.\u201D Masterson was written out of the show in its third season, after being accused of sexual assault in 2017.\n\nKutcher and Kunis wrote letters in an effort to the urge the judge for a lesser sentencing. In Kutcher\u2019s letter, he referred to Masterson as a \u201Crole model.\u201D In Kunis\u2019 letter, she vouched for Masterson\u2019s \u201Cexceptional character\u201D and referred to him as an \u201Coutstanding older brother figure.\u201D\nMasterson had been facing 30 years to life, which is the maximum sentence allowed by law. His defense was asking for 15 years to life, so those who wrote letters to the judge were likely aware he would be getting at least 15 years in prison. On Thursday, he was sentenced to the maximum 30 years to life in downtown Los Angeles. He will be eligible for parole when he is 77 years old.\nOther stars from \u201CThe 70\u2019s Show\u201D who wrote to the judge include Debra Jo Rupp, who played Kitty on the sitcom, and Kurtwood Smith, who played Red. Masterson\u2019s famous family members also wrote letters in his support, including his siblings Alanna Masterson (\u201CThe Walking Dead\u201D), Christopher Masterson (\u201CMalcolm In the Middle\u201D), Jordan Masterson (\u201CLast Man Standing\u201D), as well as his brother-in-law Billy Baldwin and his wife, the actor and model Bijou Phillips. Other Hollywood names who wrote to the judge include actor Giovanni Ribisi; Jim Patterson, creator of Netflix\u2019s \u201CThe Ranch;\u201D Masterson\u2019s former publicist, Jenni Weinman; and TV director David Trainer, who worked on \u201CThe 70\u2019s Show\u201D and \u201CThe Ranch.\u201D\nKunis\u2019 letter adds: \u201CI wholeheartedly vouch for Danny Masterson\u2019s exceptional character and the tremendous positive influence he has had on me and the people around him. His dedication to leading a drug-free life and the genuine care he extends to others make him an outstanding role model and friend.\u201D\n\nBoth Kutcher and Kunis wrote about Masterson\u2019s drug-free lifestyle, and noted he was a positive force on their lives. During the trial, prosecutors said Masterson drugged women before sexually assaulting them.",

      "description": "JASON BEGHE: THE TV TOUGH GUY WHO TOOK ON SCIENTOLOGY \n2008 - Actor Jason Beghe gives this brutally honest (and rather delightfully profane) account of his experiences in Scientology.  Raw, funny and heartfelt, Jason talks about his experiences, what was promised and what wasn\u0027t delivered during his time on L. Ron Hubbard\u0027s Bridge to Total Freedom.\nThanks a lot to Mark Bunker:\nhttps://buymeacoffee.com/xenutv\nhttps://venmo.com/u/xenutv\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted...\nhttps://cash.me/$XENUTV\n\nThe \u0027Chicago P.D.\u0027 star used to be a poster boy for the church \u2014 when he left, things got ugly\nBy ANDY GREENE/Rolling Stone \nMARCH 30, 2015\nOne night about seven years ago, the actor Jason Beghe stumbled upon his own Wikipedia page. At the bottom he found a four-word phrase that nauseated him: \u201CPublic supporter of Scientology.\u201D Beghe, who currently stars in the hit NBC show Chicago P.D., had left the church in disgust months earlier, though he hadn\u2019t yet made that public. \u201CI wrote a non-confrontational assertion that I wasn\u2019t a Scientologist anymore, and Wikipedia kept rejecting it,\u201D he says. \u201CMy buddy explained the information had to be verified.\u201D\n\nBeghe decided to take more dramatic action. He posted a two-hour video on YouTube in which he claimed the organization was \u201Cvery dangerous for your spiritual, psychological, mental, emotional health and evolution.\u201D The video shot around the world. It also put him in Scientology\u2019s crosshairs. (They call Beghe \u201Cunreliable, dishonest and biased,\u201D and group him with other former members who have spoken out against the church. Click here to read a detailed letter where they respond to the allegations that Beghe makes in this Q\u0026A.)\nA journeyman character actor who\u2019s had roles in everything from Thelma \u0026 Louise to G.I. Jane, Beghe is the most charismatic talking head in Going Clear, the new Scientology documentary from director Alex Gibney. In the film, Beghe rails at the church in a raspy tough-guy voice (it was damaged after he yanked tubes out of his throat while hospitalized for a 1999 car accident). But Going Clear reveals only part of his story, and he phoned up Rolling Stone to tell us more.\n\nWhat did you think of Going Clear?\nI\u2019ve only had time to see a rough cut on my iPad. I\u2019m also not the guy to ask since it\u2019s all old news to me. I suspect it\u2019s going to be effective as a movie and parts are really eye-opening. I think it provides useful evidence and information to make people think twice about getting involved in Scientology. And hopefully if someone is involved, this might start greasing the path for them to get out.\nI think a lot of people who see this will learn things they never knew.\nThe funny thing is that it\u2019s all out there, but it\u2019s in Lawrence Wright\u2019s book or these small chatrooms. People find movies more accessible. \n\nI suppose before the Internet it was a lot easier for anyone to suppress information.\nYeah, they tried in the beginning, but they\u2019re so incompetent at handling these things. They always use a hammer. They don\u2019t have any fine tools. They\u2019re very rough. There was a great description of them by a guy in Anonymous. He said they\u2019re constantly shooting foot bullets. Every time they try to handle something, they shoot themselves in the foot. You can almost count on them to do it.\nThey must be doing something right if they\u2019re continuing to make all this money.\nWell, yeah, if you find that rewarding. There\u2019s easier ways to make money. I just think there\u2019s some kind of evil intention at the root of it if that\u2019s how you chose to do it.\nDid you worry that by speaking out like this they\u2019d come after you?\nNot really. As soon as I posted that video on YouTube they contacted me. It\u2019s interesting because they\u2019re very adept at pushing buttons. I thought, \u201CHuh, it\u2019ll be interesting to see how they\u2019ll try and do this with me.\u201D The first thing they did was send my quote/unquote \u201Cfriends\u201D to call me all hurt. They were like, \u201CGolly. . .You know. . .Golly.\u201D It was interesting since it showed they thought I cared about other people. After that I started to do more research and I learned stuff I didn\u2019t know when I made the first video. It was one thing to take money and rip me off, but when I heard about the shit with the Sea Org, the violence and the cruelty. . .It\u2019s one thing to take someone\u2019s bread. It\u2019s another thing to take their soul. I felt like I had something to do with it, so I became a little more active. For a couple of years I became a real pain in the ass to them, so they started to attack me with phony lawsuits. They tried to bankrupt me and they came close. What was the lawsuit?\nThey sent someone to my house and they filed this lawsuit saying I beat the shit out of him, which is not true. Was he a Scientologist? What happened?\nNo. He was some process server that they hired. They know how to push my buttons...",

Mathematik, Deutsch) hat eine nachrangige Bedeutung und nimmt weniger Zeit im Stundenplan ein.\nTypischer Stundenplan:\nMorgens: Gebete (Schacharit), Tora-Studium, Hebr\u00E4isch lesen.\nVormittags: Mischna und Talmud f\u00FCr die \u00C4lteren, Einf\u00FChrung in die Gebote und j\u00FCdische Werte f\u00FCr J\u00FCngere.\nNachmittags (eingeschr\u00E4nkt): Grundkenntnisse in s\u00E4kularen F\u00E4chern wie Mathematik, Deutsch, und grundlegendes Schreiben.\nReligi\u00F6se F\u00E4cher machen oft mehr als 70 % der Unterrichtszeit aus.\nF\u00FCr M\u00E4dchen (Beis Yaakov)\n\nSchwerpunk M\u00E4dchen:\nM\u00E4dchen erhalten ebenfalls Unterricht in j\u00FCdischen Themen, aber der Schwerpunkt liegt mehr auf praktischen religi\u00F6sen Pflichten (z. B. Gebete, Koscher-Regeln) und moralischer Bildung.\nDer s\u00E4kulare Unterricht ist bei M\u00E4dchen h\u00E4ufig etwas umfangreicher als bei Jungen, da sie keine Talmud-Studien betreiben.\nTypischer Stundenplan:\nMorgens: Gebete, Studium grundlegender j\u00FCdischer Texte, Geschichten aus der Bibel (Chumash).\nVormittags: Mathematik, Deutsch, Kunst oder Handarbeit.\nNachmittags: Ethik, j\u00FCdische Traditionen, sowie Aktivit\u00E4ten wie Singen oder Basteln.\nAuch hier \u00FCberwiegen religi\u00F6se Inhalte im Vergleich zu s\u00E4kularen F\u00E4chern.\nAllgemeine Merkmale des Unterrichts\nHebr\u00E4isch als Unterrichtssprache:\nEin Gro\u00DFteil des Unterrichts, insbesondere der religi\u00F6se Teil, wird auf Hebr\u00E4isch oder Jiddisch abgehalten.\nLehrer und P\u00E4dagogen:\nDie Lehrer in diesen Schulen kommen h\u00E4ufig aus der eigenen Gemeinschaft und sind nicht immer formal p\u00E4dagogisch ausgebildet, sondern eher religi\u00F6s geschult.\nS\u00E4kulare Pr\u00FCfungen:\nKinder in diesen Schulen m\u00FCssen, wie alle anderen, die Externistenpr\u00FCfung bestehen, was sicherstellt, dass sie ein Minimum an staatlich gefordertem Wissen erwerben.",

Despite his super-secret security protections, you can still reach him pretty easily by sending him a message at tonyo94 AT gmail.com \n\n \n\nTHE UNDERGROUND BUNKER FAQ\nHere are some of the questions we tend to get from readers\u2026\n\n \nWhy is this site called \u201CThe Underground Bunker?\u201D\n\nWhen we wrote about Scientology at The Village Voice, we jokingly began referring to writing from an underground bunker. It proved to be a popular running gag, so when we left the Voice and started an independent site, we thought it would be a familiar name for our regular readers.\n\nWhy do you use \u201Cwe\u201D to refer to yourself?\n\nIt\u2019s a columnist\u2019s conceit we use out of habit and for no good reason except that it amuses us.\n\nWhy do you write about Scientology?\n\nBecause it interests us. We started writing about Scientology with our first cover story for the Phoenix New Times in November 1995, and that experience only whetted our appetite for more. Some people cover Congress, other people cover the mafia, we cover Scientology. It\u2019s a fascinating story that is only getting more interesting with time, and we enjoy having a seat on the front row as this adventure unfolds.\n\nWere you ever involved with Scientology?\n\nNo.\n\nDoes Scientology hassle you?\n\nThe church, through its private investigators, has tried to make reporting on it difficult for many journalists. It\u2019s an occupational hazard.\n\nYou\u2019re very critical of Scientology. Why?\n\nWe don\u2019t like bullies.\n\nIs Scientology a cult?\n\nWe find \u201Ccult\u201D to be a completely meaningless word. At other websites, discussions about Scientology end up devolving into endless argument about words like \u201Ccult\u201D or \u201Creligion.\u201D At the Bunker, we call Scientology a church because that\u2019s what Scientologists call it and because we\u2019re more interested in what Scientology does than what it says about itself. Here\u2019s how we answered this question in March 2015 when it was asked by Caroline Modarressy-Tehrani on HuffPost Live\u2026\n\nWas the 2005 South Park episode about Xenu really what Scientologists believe?\n\nYes and no. An important point to keep in mind is that Scientology is a system of increasingly expensive courses, and only a minority of church members reach the highest levels of advancement. A church spokeswoman once told us that only about 10 percent of Scientologists reach the \u201COT\u201D levels, which include the story of Xenu the galactic overlord (in \u201COT III\u201D) that South Park had fun with. And even for those Scientologists who do reach OT III and higher, they spend only a very short time considering the Xenu material, and for the most part it has almost nothing to do with their overall experience in the church. (The Xenu story leads to church members then exorcising \u201Cbody thetans\u201D \u2014 disembodied alien souls which are attached to each one of us \u2014 and spend years and huge amounts of money to do so. Body Thetans are much more a part of the upper-level Scientology experience than Xenu, which is dealt with only briefly.) So while the Xenu material is undoubtedly a striking part of Scientology\u2019s esoteric system, and one that rightly does cast doubt on everything else L. Ron Hubbard came up with, when Scientologists tell you that Xenu has nothing to do with their experience in the church, they\u2019re probably telling the truth.\n\nDo people in the Church of Scientology read your website?\n\nYes they do. And we hear from some of them. But others are very good at shielding themselves from anything negative about Scientology.\n\nWe saw you in Alex Gibney\u2019s documentary, Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief. Were you paid for that appearance? And when were you interviewed?\n\nWe were very fortunate that Alex Gibney and Lawrence Wright included us in their great film about Scientology. Alex interviewed us in March 2014, and the movie debuted on January 25, 2015 at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. We were not paid for our appearance in the film, and we paid our own way to the premiere in Utah.",

      "description": "Scientologe Gottfried Helnwein und sein privater Steuerberater, Ex-Scientologe und enger Freund Erwin Annau in den 80er und 90er Jahren..\n\nARTE 13.2.2024 - von Markus Th\u00F6\u00DF - Ein sehr informative und spannende Dokumentation\n2016 gr\u00FCndete der Ex-Scientologe Erwin Annau das El Paraiso Verde, das gr\u00FCne Paradies. Corona-Geimpfte sind dort unerw\u00FCnscht. Er und seine Frau Sylvia verwandelten ein Feuchtgebiet von 16 Quadratkilometern im S\u00FCden von Paraguay in eine gigantische Gated Community mit bewaffneten Aufpassern...\n\nHelnwein und Annau:\nAusschnitt aus dem Buch \u0022Helnwein und Scientology\u0022 von Peter Reichelt:\n...Die nun nach Wien zu Helnwein flie\u00DFenden, weltweit erzielten, recht hohen Verkaufseinnahmen, waren auch der Hauptgrund, weshalb sich Helnwein seit 1981 auf besonders geschickte steuerliche Berater vertrauensvoll verlassen wollte und auch mu\u00DFte.\nDiesen fand Helnwein in dem Wiener Scientologen Dr. Erwin Annau, eine schillernde Figur in der \u00F6sterreichischen Scientologen-Szene. Erwin Annau, wurde der Steuerberater der \u0022 Gottfried Helnwein Ges.m.b.H. \u0022 in Wien sowie des Ehepaares Helnwein. Erstes Ziel Annaus war es, jeweils die offiziellen Einnahmen durch \u0022betrieblich\u0022 bedingte Ausgaben zu vermindern. Dabei verfiel man auf die geniale Idee, Gottfried Helnweins \u0022 Spenden \u0022 Kosten f\u00FCr Scientology-Kurse und Aufenthalte im rangh\u00F6chsten Scientology SEA ORG Hauptquartier FLAG in Clearwater/ Florida als \u0022k\u00FCnstlerische\u0022 Beratungen und damit betriebsbedingte Ausgaben zu verbuchen und abzusetzen.\nDas Hauptquartier FLAG half dabei gerne mit. Allein im Jahr 1982 stellte die\u0022 FSO\u0022 (FLAG SERVICE ORG, 210 S. Fort Harrison Ave., Clearwater, Florida 34616, USA) eine \u201ERechnung\u201C von umgerechnet \u00FCber DM 12.000, auf \u0022Gottfried Helnwein, Neustiftgasse in Wien\u0022 f\u00FCr \u201EKulturmanagement und Beratungskurse\u201C aus. Bezahlt werden sollte die Summe, auf Anweisung der FSO per Telex-\u00DCberweisung auf ein geheimes FSO Sonderkonto bei der Creditbank Luxemburg. \u00C4hnlich lief es auch in den folgenden Jahren bis zu Helnweins \u0022Auswanderung\u0022 nach Deutschland im Winter 1984 ab.\n1985 teilte Annau seinem Freund Gottfried voller Stolz und Arroganz \u00FCber die angebliche Dummheit der Wiener Finanzbeamten mit, die Helnweins Steuererkl\u00E4rung f\u00FCr das Jahr 1983 zu pr\u00FCfen hatten, da\u00DF das \u0022 Scientology Ausgabenmodell \u0022 wieder einmal, wie auch im Jahr zuvor, von den Finanzbeh\u00F6rden ohne Probleme akzeptiert worden war. Auch f\u00FCr die \u0022Helnwein GmbH\u0022 hatte Annau etwas parat. Neben Helnwein, beriet Annau auch andere Topscientologen in \u00D6sterreich steuerlich, u.a. J\u00FCrgen Walter Epple. Epple war wie Annau seit Herbst 1994 in einen umfangreichen Steuerhinterziehungsskandal verwickelt, in deren Untersuchung auch die \u0022Scientology \u00D6sterreich\u0022-Organisation eine tragende Rolle spielt. Grund: Ausstellung von diversen Scheinrechnungen.\nAuch die Firma \u0022 Gottfried Helnwein Ges.m.b.H. \u0022, die ebenfalls in die gro\u00DF angelegte Untersuchung der Wiener Finanzbeh\u00F6rden verwickelt ist, erhielt 1985, nach deren Feststellungen, eine \u201EScheinrechnung\u201C einer Epple Firma mit Sitz im schweizerisch-italienischen Steuerparadies Campione \u00FCber mehr als DM 120.000 f\u00FCr diverse \u0022Berater\u0022-T\u00E4tigkeiten des Herrn J.W Epple. Diese bestand aus zwei T\u00E4tigkeiten:\na. Bilanzanalyse f\u00FCr die Gesch\u00E4ftsjahre 1981 bis 1984 und \nb.Analyse und Perspektiventwicklung eines Scientology-Celebrity Centers unter der pers\u00F6nlichen Leitung von Gottfried Helnwein in Burgbrohl/Deutschland ab 1985. Besonders nach Durchsicht des Inhaltes des zweiten Komplexes wird deutlich, wie intensiv und detailliert von und mit Helnwein Aufbau und Durchf\u00FChrung einer neuen Scientology Organisation in Deutschland geplant war und die theoretischen Entwicklungskosten daf\u00FCr sogar noch in \u00D6sterreich steuerlich abgesetzt werden sollten.\nErwin Annau wirkte auch noch nach Helnweins Umzug von Wien nach Burgbrohl und seinem damit verbundenen Ausstieg als GmbH Gesch\u00E4ftsf\u00FChrer, als Nachfolger setzte er den \u0022Patron\u0022 Toni Morell ein, als sein Steuerberater. 1989 verschickte Annau an seine gesamte scientologische Kundschaft ein Rundschreiben, vornehmlich an Wiener \u0022 WISE \u0022 - Mitglieder, WISE ist die finanzkr\u00E4ftigste scientologische Unterorganisation, ausschlie\u00DFlich f\u00FCr Wirtschaftsunternehmen, Selbst\u00E4ndige und Freiberufler, die, gegen Zahlung eines hohen Mitgliedsbeitrages sowie Umsatzbeteiligungen, die \u00FCber Umwege an die Zentrale nach Florida flie\u00DFen, der Hubbard-Wirtschaftsdoktrin folgen d\u00FCrfen. In seinem Informationsbrief \u00FCbermittelte er die von der WISE- Zentrale in Clearwater erhaltene Anweisung \u0022alle zuk\u00FCnftigen Zahlungen auf das neue Konto bei der Creditbank Luxemburg, Stichwort \u0022FSO\u0022, einzuzahlen\u0022.\nAuch der Gesch\u00E4ftsf\u00FChrer des \u0022WISE\u0022-Mitgliedes, die \u201EGottfried Helnwein Ges.m.b.H.\u201C. Anton \u0022 Toni \u0022 Morell, beglich kurz nach Erhalt des Rundbriefes eine offene Rechnung f\u00FCr \u201EBeratert\u00E4tigkeiten\u201C mit einer Scheck-Zahlung von \u00FCber DM 17.000 durch Einreichung auf das ihm von Annau bekanntgegebene Konto bei der Creditbank in Luxemburg, zu Gunsten der \u0022 FSO \u0022in Clearwater...",

Einbruch und Diebstahl von Regierungsdokumenten\nDie wiederholten Einbr\u00FCche in Regierungsgeb\u00E4ude und der Diebstahl vertraulicher Dokumente durch das Guardian\u2019s Office w\u00E4ren als schwere Straftaten eingestuft worden. Da Hubbard als Anf\u00FChrer und Planer der Operation Snow White galt, h\u00E4tte er auch ohne direkte Beteiligung an den Einbr\u00FCchen die Verantwortung tragen k\u00F6nnen.\nEinbruch in Bundesgeb\u00E4ude und Diebstahl staatlicher Dokumente k\u00F6nnten mit bis zu zehn Jahren Gef\u00E4ngnis pro Vorfall bestraft werden, insbesondere wenn diese Straftaten gegen nationale Sicherheitsinteressen versto\u00DFen.\n3.

Illegale \u00DCberwachung und Abh\u00F6ren (Wiretapping and Surveillance)\nDie \u00DCberwachung und das Abh\u00F6ren von Regierungsbeamten verletzen das Federal Wiretap Act und das Recht auf Privatsph\u00E4re.\nIllegales Abh\u00F6ren kann eine Haftstrafe von bis zu f\u00FCnf Jahren und eine erhebliche Geldstrafe nach sich ziehen.\n5. RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) \u2013 Organisierte Kriminalit\u00E4t\nAufgrund der systematischen, koordinierten und illegalen Handlungen innerhalb der Scientology-Kirche und des Guardian\u2019s Office h\u00E4tte Hubbard unter Umst\u00E4nden auch nach dem RICO-Gesetz angeklagt werden k\u00F6nnen. Dieses Gesetz richtet sich gegen organisierte Kriminalit\u00E4t und erm\u00F6glicht es, Anklage gegen Personen zu erheben, die kriminelle Aktivit\u00E4ten organisieren oder koordinieren.\nBei einer Verurteilung unter RICO drohen Strafen von bis zu 20 Jahren pro Anklagepunkt, und RICO-Verurteilungen k\u00F6nnen Verm\u00F6gensbeschlagnahme umfassen.\nGesamte Strafh\u00F6he\nInsgesamt h\u00E4tte Hubbard bei einer Verurteilung f\u00FCr diese Anklagepunkte eine kumulative Haftstrafe von mehreren Jahrzehnten \u2013 potenziell bis zu lebenslanger Haft \u2013 erhalten k\u00F6nnen, je nach Umfang der Anklagen und der Urteile der einzelnen Straftaten. \nDa er als Hauptorganisator und treibende Kraft hinter der Operation Snow White galt, h\u00E4tten die Strafverfolgungsbeh\u00F6rden wahrscheinlich die maximale Strafe angestrebt.\nFinanzielle Konsequenzen und Reputationsverlust\nZus\u00E4tzlich zu den potenziellen Haftstrafen h\u00E4tte Hubbard hohe Geldstrafen und m\u00F6glicherweise eine vollst\u00E4ndige Verm\u00F6gensbeschlagnahme durch das RICO-Gesetz zu erwarten gehabt. Dies h\u00E4tte sein pers\u00F6nliches Verm\u00F6gen und das Verm\u00F6gen der Scientology-Kirche erheblich geschw\u00E4cht.\n\nZusammenfassend h\u00E4tte L. Ron Hubbard, w\u00E4re er verurteilt worden, die schwerstm\u00F6glichen Strafen des US-Justizsystems zu erwarten gehabt, die sich aus den koordinierten und gravierenden kriminellen Aktivit\u00E4ten der Operation Snow White ergaben. \n\nDiese Konsequenzen erkl\u00E4ren, warum Hubbard sich ab den sp\u00E4ten 1970er Jahren versteckte und bis zu seinem Tod im Jahr 1986 zur\u00FCckgezogen lebte.\n\nFOUNDING CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY OF WASHINGTON, D.C., INC., Appellant, v.

F\u00E4lschung von Dokumenten und Identit\u00E4tsdiebstahl\nDie F\u00E4lschung offizieller Dokumente (wie Ausweispapiere) und Identit\u00E4tsdiebstahl sind Bundesdelikte, die ernsthafte Konsequenzen nach sich ziehen.\nDokumentenf\u00E4lschung und Identit\u00E4tsdiebstahl k\u00F6nnen mit bis zu f\u00FCnf Jahren Haft pro Anklagepunkt bestraft werden.\n4. Illegale \u00DCberwachung und Abh\u00F6ren (Wiretapping and Surveillance)\nDie \u00DCberwachung und das Abh\u00F6ren von Regierungsbeamten verletzen das Federal Wiretap Act und das Recht auf Privatsph\u00E4re.\nIllegales Abh\u00F6ren kann eine Haftstrafe von bis zu f\u00FCnf Jahren und eine erhebliche Geldstrafe nach sich ziehen.\n5. RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) \u2013 Organisierte Kriminalit\u00E4t\nAufgrund der systematischen, koordinierten und illegalen Handlungen innerhalb der Scientology-Kirche und des Guardian\u2019s Office h\u00E4tte Hubbard unter Umst\u00E4nden auch nach dem RICO-Gesetz angeklagt werden k\u00F6nnen. Dieses Gesetz richtet sich gegen organisierte Kriminalit\u00E4t und erm\u00F6glicht es, Anklage gegen Personen zu erheben, die kriminelle Aktivit\u00E4ten organisieren oder koordinieren.\nBei einer Verurteilung unter RICO drohen Strafen von bis zu 20 Jahren pro Anklagepunkt, und RICO-Verurteilungen k\u00F6nnen Verm\u00F6gensbeschlagnahme umfassen.\nGesamte Strafh\u00F6he\nInsgesamt h\u00E4tte Hubbard bei einer Verurteilung f\u00FCr diese Anklagepunkte eine kumulative Haftstrafe von mehreren Jahrzehnten \u2013 potenziell bis zu lebenslanger Haft \u2013 erhalten k\u00F6nnen, je nach Umfang der Anklagen und der Urteile der einzelnen Straftaten. \nDa er als Hauptorganisator und treibende Kraft hinter der Operation Snow White galt, h\u00E4tten die Strafverfolgungsbeh\u00F6rden wahrscheinlich die maximale Strafe angestrebt.\nFinanzielle Konsequenzen und Reputationsverlust\nZus\u00E4tzlich zu den potenziellen Haftstrafen h\u00E4tte Hubbard hohe Geldstrafen und m\u00F6glicherweise eine vollst\u00E4ndige Verm\u00F6gensbeschlagnahme durch das RICO-Gesetz zu erwarten gehabt. Dies h\u00E4tte sein pers\u00F6nliches Verm\u00F6gen und das Verm\u00F6gen der Scientology-Kirche erheblich geschw\u00E4cht.\n\nZusammenfassend h\u00E4tte L. Ron Hubbard, w\u00E4re er verurteilt worden, die schwerstm\u00F6glichen Strafen des US-Justizsystems zu erwarten gehabt, die sich aus den koordinierten und gravierenden kriminellen Aktivit\u00E4ten der Operation Snow White ergaben. \n\nDiese Konsequenzen erkl\u00E4ren, warum Hubbard sich ab den sp\u00E4ten 1970er Jahren versteckte und bis zu seinem Tod im Jahr 1986 zur\u00FCckgezogen lebte.",

      "description": "The grand jury named L. Ron Hubbard as an unindicted co-conspirator\n\nDie Grand Jury nannte L. Ron Hubbard als nicht angeklagten Mitverschw\u00F6rer\n\n2023 You Tube Documentation by\ndarkfrontier.tv\nwww.youtube.com/@darkfrontier\n\n\nBurglaries and Lies Paved a Path to Prison\nEinbr\u00FCche und L\u00FCgen ebneten den Weg ins Gef\u00E4ngnis\n\nLos Angeles Times\nBy Robert W. Welkos and Joel Sappell\nJune 24, 1990\n\nIt began with the title of a fairy tale -- Snow White.\n\nThat was the benign code name Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard gave to an ominous plan that would envelop his church in scandal and send its upper echelon to prison, a plan rooted in his ever-deepening fears and suspicions.\n\nSnow White began in 1973 as an effort by Scientology through Freedom of Information proceedings to purge government files of what Hubbard thought was false information being circulated worldwide to discredit him and the church. But the operation soon mushroomed into a massive criminal conspiracy, executed by the church\u2019s legal and investigative arm, the Guardian Office.\n\nUnder the direction of Hubbard\u2019s wife, Mary Sue, the Guardian Office hatched one scheme after another to discredit and unnerve Scientology\u2019s foes across the country. Guardian Office members were trained to lie, or in their words, \u201Cto outflow false data effectively.\u201D They compiled enemy lists and subjected those on the lists to smear campaigns and dirty tricks.\n\nTheir targets were in the government, the press, the medical profession, wherever a potential threat surfaced.\n\nIn Washington, Scientology spies penetrated such high-security agencies as the Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Service to find what they had on Hubbard and the church.\n\nIn nighttime raids, they rifled files and photocopied mountains of documents, many of which the church had unsuccessfully sought under the federal Freedom of Information Act.\n\nThe thefts were inside jobs; the Guardian Office had planted one agent in the IRS as a clerk typist and another in the Justice Department as the personal secretary of an assistant U.S. attorney who was handling Freedom of Information lawsuits filed by Scientology.\n\nSo bold had they become that one Guardian Office operative slipped into an IRS conference room and wired a bugging device into a wall socket before a crucial meeting on Scientology was to be convened. The operative rigged the device so he could eavesdrop over his car\u2019s FM radio.\n\nThe U.S. was losing a war it did not even know it was fighting. But that was about to change.\n\nTwo Scientologists used fake IRS credentials to gain access to government agencies and then photocopied documents related to the church. Their conspiracy was exposed when one of the suspects, after 11 months on the lam, became worried about his plight and confessed to authorities, prompting the FBI to launch one of the biggest raids in its history.\n\nArmed with power saws, crowbars and bolt cutters, 134 agents burst into three Scientology locations in Los Angeles and Washington.\n\nThey carted off eavesdropping equipment, burglar tools and 48,000 documents detailing countless operations against \u201Cenemies\u201D in public and private life.\n\nIn the end, Hubbard\u2019s wife and the others were found guilty of charges of conspiracy and burglary. The grand jury named Hubbard as an unindicted co-conspirator; the seized Guardian Office files did not directly link him to the crimes and he professed ignorance of them.\n\nIn a memorandum urging stiff sentences for the Scientologists, federal prosecutors wrote:\n\n\u201CThe crime committed by these defendants is of a breadth and scope previously unheard of. No building, office, desk, or file was safe from their snooping and prying. No individual or organization was free from their despicable conspiratorial minds. The tools of their trade were miniature transmitters, lock picks, secret codes, forged credentials and any other device they found necessary to carry out their conspiratorial schemes.\u201D\n\nThe 11 defendants were ordered to serve five years in federal prison. All are now free.",

      "description": "SECRET SCIENTOLOGY COMPOUND - Few non-Scientolgists have ever been inside the secret Scientology compound. \n\nFormer Chief of Police, Tim Gallegos, describes what it was like.\n60 Minutes Australia TV 24.3.2014\n\nTrementina Base is the popular designation for a property of the Scientology-affiliated Church of Spiritual Technology (CST) near Trementina, New Mexico, US.\nAccording to the CST, an entity formed to manage the Church of Scientology\u0027s copyright affairs, the purpose of the base is to provide storage space for an archiving project to preserve Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard\u0027s writings, films and recordings for future generations. Hubbard\u0027s texts have been engraved on stainless steel tablets and encased in titanium capsules underground. The project began in the late 1980s.\n\nThe Church of Scientology protects Hubbard\u0027s writings with \u201Cextraordinary zeal.\u201D Copies of Hubbard\u0027s text are preserved and hidden behind fences, in deep vaults, guarded by tight security. The underground compound \u201Cstands as a symbol of the timelessness of Hubbard\u2019s texts and as a three-dimensional manifestation of the \u2018purity of Hubbard\u2019s legacy.\u201D\n\nThe base includes a number of dwellings and the archives themselves, the latter in a network of tunnels. The base also has its own private, paved airstrip, the San Miguel Ranch Airport (NM53).\n\nThe property history of Trementina Base is complex. The Federal Register shows that CST has owned two properties in the same area at different times. The one they originally built the underground vault on, between 1986 and 1992.\n\nDepartment of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management Number: G-910-G3-0006-4210-04; NMNM 83264\nThe United States issued an exchange conveyance document to the Church of Spiritual Technology, a California corporation, on August 24, 1992, for the surface estate in the following described land in San Miguel County, New Mexico, pursuant to section 206 of the Act of October 21, 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1716).\nNew Mexico Principal Meridian T. 15 N., R. 22 E. ...Containing 400.00 acres (1.6187 km2).\nIn exchange for the land described above, the Church of Spiritual Technology conveyed to the United States the surface estate in the following described land located in San Miguel County, New Mexico:\nNew Mexico Principal Meridian T. 17 N., R. 23 E. ...Containing 400.00 acres (1.6187 km2).\nThe values of the Federal public land and the non-Federal land in the exchange were appraised at $28,000.00. The public interest was served through the completion of this exchange.\nCST purchased the original site in 1986 for $250,976, then invested millions in building an underground vault on the property. The Federal Register record says both properties were valued at only $28,000 at the time of the land swap in August 1992. However, footage from KRQE TV shows the presence of a vault built into the mountainside between the runway and the CST logo.\nAn aerial photograph showing the base\u0027s enormous Scientology symbols on the ground caused media interest and broke the story in November 2005. According to a Washington Post report, the Church\u0027s first reaction was to attempt to suppress the information:\n\nThe church tried to persuade station KRQE not to air its report last week about the aerial signposts marking a Scientology compound that includes a huge vault \u0022built into a mountainside,\u0022 the station said on its Website. ... Based in Los Angeles, the corporation dispatched an official named Jane McNairn and an attorney to visit the TV station in an effort to squelch the story, KRQE news director Michelle Donaldson said.\nThe church offered a tour of the underground facility if KRQE would kill the piece, the station said in its newscast. Scientology also called KRQE\u2019s owner, Emmis Communications, and \u201Csought the help of a powerful New Mexican lawmaker\u201D to lobby against airing the piece, the station reported on its Web site.\nThe huge symbols on the base, distinguishable only from an aerial view ([7] 35\u00B031\u002728.56\u0022N 104\u00B034\u002720.20\u0022W), are specifically those of Scientology\u0027s Church of Spiritual Technology.[8] Former members of the Church have said that the symbol marks a \u0022return point\u0022 for Scientologists to help find Hubbard\u0027s works when they travel here in the future from other places in the universe.\nOther locations\nReportedly, two similar bases maintained by the Church of Spiritual Technology are located in Petrolia, California (40\u00B023\u002715.55\u0022N 124\u00B018\u002719.05\u0022W), and Creston, California (35\u00B027\u002712.29\u0022N 120\u00B029\u002759.20\u0022W), both for archiving permanent backups of Hubbard\u0027s every written and spoken word. Internal Revenue Service records show that Scientologists spent $13 million in 1992 to preserve Hubbard\u0027s fiction and non-fiction writings on 1.8 million stainless steel discs, and recorded his lectures on 187,000 nickel records. The Church of Spiritual Technology symbol also appears at the Petrolia location and in the middle of a track at the ranch in Creston, California where L. Ron Hubbard died.",

It is run by Miscavige and some of\nhis lieutenants, which is a revolving door of a few people. It is run by Miscavige, his oligarchs who run the production facilities in LA (Bridge, Dissem Center, Compilations.) The International Base where Gold is, is not long the seat of power. \n\nI want to answer your question about who invented the Scientology Network. It was Miscavige\u0027s brain child in 2016. I helped set it up and did a lot of the work developing their public mission statement. It was originally set up to be an extension of Freedom magazin -- Freedom TV.  \n\nFinally Scientology Network started on March 12, 2018, introduced by David Miscavige. Gottfried Helnwein attended front row the Miscavige celebration show in Scientology Clearwater.\n\n2019 - Helnwein started as a prominent Scientology celebrity promotion person at the Scientology Network TV ... until 2024 online. The only Scientology celebrity.\n\nMiscavige had spent a fortune investigating his enemies like Lawrence Wright, Alex Gibney, Tracy McManus, Tom Tobin and Joe Childs and was going to \u0022expose\u0022 them on his new TV network. He spent a million dollars on SMP and never got Freedom TV off the ground. The investigative journalists he hired to work for Freedom all left in\ndisgust because they hated Miscavige, one of the five stayed because he\u0027s worried about\nlosing his greencard. This is why SMP is a $100M disaster!\n\nThe \u0022Documentary Showcase\u0022 on the Scientology Network was Miscavige\u0027s idea.\nThey purchase broadcast rights from filmmakers whose films they want to be\npositioned with. Make no mistake about it, the Scientology Network paid a rental fee to show the \u0022The Dreaming Child\u0022. I know how the \u0022Documentary Showcase\u0022 works. I\ncurated the first season.\n\nOSA would not contact Helnwein. Miscavige hates OSA. They are incompetent, foolish underlings to him. He would have been contacted by an executed at SMP.

He has made super-high-quality films of Scientology facilities, using a 4K camera mounted on a drone.\nYou have never seen Scientology\u2019s secretive compounds like this.

So while they\u2019re available, please give them a good look.\n\nToday, we\u2019re embedding two flyovers of Scientology\u2019s 500-acre international management headquarters near Hemet, California. Known as \u201CInt Base\u201D to Scientologists, it\u2019s also called \u201CGold\u201D or \u201CGold Base\u201D because it houses the studios of Golden Era Productions, where Scientology makes its films.\n\nWhen you play the videos, make sure to full-screen them so you can take in the incredible detail.\n\nWe sent some screenshots from the videos to Tom DeVocht \u2014 a man who worked at the base over two lengthy stints, the last ending in 2005. In the shot below from the opening of the first video, he pointed out that \u201Cberthing\u201D \u2014 a set of newer apartment buildings \u2014 can be seen in the middle of the picture.\n\n\u201CBerthing was one of the things I got declared for,\u201D DeVocht says, referring to being \u201Cdeclared\u201D a \u201Csuppressive person,\u201D which is how a Scientologist is excommunicated. Construction of the berthing apartment buildings had been taking a long time, but DeVocht was aware that when they were finished, Scientology leader David Miscavige was going to use them to lock away dissident members.\n\n\u201CI didn\u2019t complete them so DM could lock up the SPs there. Fuck that, I\u2019m not locking anyone up,\u201D he says, which is what got him in trouble.\n\nAlso in the frame, at the bottom of the picture on the right side, you can see a building that DeVocht says was a special gym constructed for the use of Miscavige and his best bud, Tom Cruise.\n\nThe view then moves on to take in a closer look at one of the most significant places in the compound, Building 50, the offices of the Religious Technology Center and its chairman, Scientology leader David Miscavige. It\u2019s a massive building that houses elaborate rooms dedicated to Miscavige\u2019s use \u2014 rooms that we gave you a good look at a couple of years ago.\n\nDeVocht says that on the far side of Building 50, you can see a long, rectangular building. That\u2019s a garage for Miscavige\u2019s automobiles. And to the right, out of the picture, there\u2019s a power plant that was built to make sure that Int Base has its own electricity supply. DeVocht says that Miscavige complained that noise from the power plant would be heard from his offices, so they had to make sure that it was far enough away, and that Building 50 was built like a tank, so the noise wouldn\u2019t bother him.\nThe view then moves to the left, and we get our first really good look at Bonnie View and the outbuildings near it.\n  \nBonnie View was the name of a Scottish-themed residence that was on this spot when the church bought the property, which had been a resort known as Gilman Hot Springs. L. Ron Hubbard liked the Bonnie View house, modest as it was, and intended to live in it when he was visiting the base and no longer in hiding. But Miscavige had the house torn down and replaced with this much larger version.\nWhen we asked what was in the building today, DeVocht says the place is filled with items from Hubbard\u2019s life.\nThe view turns again to the left, and downhill, back toward the highway that bisects the compound. From this view we can see quite a few buildings clustered in front of us.\u201CThere are maybe just a couple of staff members in Bonnie View now. It has all of LRH\u2019s artifacts. His Boy Scout stuff. It\u2019s supposed to be a museum, and there was talk that maybe someday it would be open to the public.\u201D He adds that construction of the house was rushed and shoddy. \u201CThat place was built as badly as Building 50. In a major quake, that building will come down.\u201D\n\nHe also learned that the artifacts in the house are just replicas. \u201CThe originals are kept in a vault at CST,\u201D he says, referring to the Church of Spiritual Technology, the strange Scientology entity that digs vaults in various places for storing Hubbard\u2019s writings so they survive a nuclear holocaust.\n...\nAs for the structures around Bonnie View, the small building to its right, with a peaked roof, is a garage that houses Hubbard\u2019s Dodge Dart and his Bluebird motorhome...",

      "description": "Biggi Reichert...The Strange Death Case not only of the German woman Biggi Reichert - a documentary - NTV 2014\n\nStill unsolved!!!\n\nPosted on September 24, 2011 by Mark C. Rathbun\n\nI am investigating the circumstances and cover up of the 2006  untimely and unfortunate death of a senior  German Scientologist.\n\nBiggie was an OT VIII.  She was also an IAS Patron.\n\nBiggi married an apparently wealthy Scientologist real estate speculator Juergen Reichert.   Biggi learned after the wedding that Juergen  was in fact deep in debt.\n\nIn 2000 Biggi was Mission Holder of the Augsburg Mission.\n\nIn 2006 Biggi Reichert was the Public Exec Sec at the Hamburg Scientology organization.\n\nIn 2006 Biggi wrote a note to the Flag Solo NOTs Director of Processing that she had allegedly attained the pinnacle of the Bridge, yet the two ruins she got into Scientology to handle were still her ruins: the Second Dynamic (sex, marriage and the rearing of children) and money.  At the time she and her husband were in debt to the tune of approximately ten million Euros (or 16 million US dollars). Biggi had begun a liaison of some sort with a Scientologist banker named Axel Rudel.\n\nBiggi went to Flag for a handling. Her return ticket indicated she intended to stay for two weeks.  After four days at Flag, she was escorted to the airport by two Scientologists.   One of those escorts was reportedly OT VIII Rainer Bierman. Biggi flew back to Hamburg.  She took off in her car.\n\nShe spent three days at the horse ranch of her Scientologist friend Gloria Schluter.                     .\nOn the final day of her visit Biggi was found dead in the garage in her car.  Sleeping pills were spread about the front seat.  The car was fitted with a hose directing the exhaust into the seating compartment.  Autopsy determined she died of carbon monoxide poisoning; and that though she had consumed sleeping pills the dosage was not enough to have caused her death.  A will of sorts was left behind in Biggi\u2019s hand distributing what few possessions she still owned.\n\nBiggi\u2019s scalp contained more than a dozen small third degree burns.  While each burn was about the size of a cigarette ember, they were determined forensically to not be cigarette burns.  Her hair did not appear to be burned; leading to the conclusion the burns were carefully administered.  The burns were determined to most likely have occurred while Biggi was in Florida.\n\nJuergen Reichert disappeared and is not cooperating with police.  Gloria Schluter did not provide any substantive information.  The \u201Cchurch\u201D has been mum, as per usual, as if it was a matter that its staff knew nothing about. And of course they provided none of the tomes of documents such matters by policy would require they write and file.  The United States government is reluctant to provide assistance to the German government in getting to the bottom of this, having been effectively bought off by David Miscavige\u2019s agents.\n\nScientologists in good standing who inquired of the church about the disappearance of Biggi were lied to.  They were told that Biggi suddenly suffered a heart attack and died, period.\n\nIf anyone has any information leading to the resolution of the mystery surrounding the death of Biggi Reichert, please share them.  If you require anonymity, contact me at my secure address, howdoesitfeel@hushmail.com.\n\nPlease, if  you have any possibly relevant facts, pass them along for the benefit of Biggi.\n\nMinimally, Biggi was abandoned by her \u201Cchurch\u201D and her \u201Cfriends\u201D.\n\nWe apparently are the only friends she\u2019s got left.\n\nMarty Rathbun\n\n\n\nabout the documentary NTV 2014:\n\nIn this film, we investigate three cases of deaths of Scientology members. We find incomplete police investigations, suspicious circumstances and family members who are convinced there is more to their loved ones deaths\u2019 than meets the eye.\n\nMake sure you subscribe to get your regular crime fix:    / realcrime  \n\nFrom \u0022Scientology: Mysterious Deaths\u0022\n\nBiggi Reichert aus Bayern war ein prominentes Mitglied der Psycho-Sekte.

      "title": "Artist Gottfried Helnwein and his relation to Bruce Hines - \u0022Auditor To The Stars\u0022 like Tom Cruise..",
      "description": "Auditing Gottfried Helnwein by Bruce Hines in Clearwater/Florida \nNot only Gottfried Helnwein, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman had been audited by Bruce Hines, former Scientology Auditor To The Stars.\n\nFebruary 2023 - About auditing the Austrian artist Gottfried Helnwein by Bruce Hines.\n\n\u0022I met Gottfried in the early 1980s at the Flag Land Base in Clearwater, Florida. That is where the Flag Service Organization is located. ...A few years later I was in the Sea Org and on staff at Flag, where I was an auditor. Because I spoke German, I often audited people from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. In about 1983 Gottfried Helnwein was assigned to me to audit him. I recall that for a time before that, he had been dissatisfied with Scientology because, after he was audited on Expanded Dianetics, he got a physical condition that caused him to lose all his hair. Even his eyebrows. He wore a wig and glasses. \n\nHe liked me as an auditor. He returned to Flag at least once after that first visit and requested that I audit him. So he was again assigned to me as his auditor. \nIn his earlier auditing he had reached the level of \u0022NOTs\u0022 (New Era Dianetics for Operating Thetans) and so at Flag, he needed an auditor who had been trained on that type of auditing. I was such an auditor, and I was also one of the few who could also audit in German. For that reason, Gottfried was assigned to me to audit him. He did not make a special request. Flag auditors usually were auditing three or four or five people per day, seven days per week.\n\nGottfried did not call me to get auditing. He made arrangements with the Flag Service Organization to go there to receive continue in his auditing \u0022up the Bridge.\u0022 Auditing is arranged in levels. Generally a person will pay money to Flag and then go there to do their next level, or a few levels. They believe that this is how they can make progress to the high states that Scientology promotes.\n\nI audited Gottfried on two or three of his trips to Flag. Each trip lasted about a week. The length of the sessions vary, but usually they last about 30 minutes (at the level of NOTs).\n\nSo, I began auditing Gottfried. It was not because I had some special status as a \u0022celebrity auditor.\u0022 In my work at Flag, I did occasionally audit a celebrity, and I also did later after I had been promoted to the International Base near Hemet, California. Gottfried liked me as an auditor. When he referred to me as the king of auditors, it was just his way of saying that he thought I was a very good auditor.\n\nAs his auditor, I did have his \u0022pc file.\u0022 An auditor must have the folder of the person they are auditing. A person being audited usually has many auditing folders. A written record is kept of every session and these are arranged chronologically in the folders. The contents of these files are confidential.\n\nI did not have access to his ethics files, nor to his CF files. CF stands for Central Files. ethics files are kept in the Ethics Section of the organization and contain reports that might have been written about the person, notes made by the Ethics Officer, and possibly some other things. I don\u0027t know what was in Gottfried\u0027s files. The CF file contains copies of letters that people working for the sales area of the organization may have written to the person, plus any replies from the person. These letters are efforts to sell services or books to public Scientologists.\n\nI don\u0027t recall giving Gottfried a Sec Check. That kind of action became more common in later years. The questions I asked Gottfried in the auditing had to do with locating and getting rid of \u0022body thetans.\u0022 These are supposedly, according to Scientology theory, spiritual beings that are stuck to the body of the person being auditing. It is a major part of a Scientologist\u0027s quest to achieve special abilities, as promised by Scientology promotional materials. I can say that this method does not work, as I audited hundreds of people using these techniques and none of them acquired any super abilities.\n\nThe auditing sessions that I performed on Gottfried took place in my auditing room in the Fort Harrison Hotel in Clearwater.\n\nI believe the last time I audited Gottfried was in 1985. There was nothing special about the auditing. I didn\u0027t learn anything unusual about him. I remember him loving to engage in lively conversations. He told interesting and funny stories.\n\nI left Flag in 1986, having been sent to California. I became staff at the International Base. There I was good friends with Kurt Weiland. He had been GO staff in Munich while I was in Germany. \n\nI did not see Gottfried again until I happened to run in to him at the Celebrity Center in Los Angeles in 1994. He was there with Renate. He was being handled there, as a celebrity, because he had said in an interview that he was jewish. Scientology management thought he should be telling people that he was a Scientologist, not that he was a jew. \n\n\n\nVideo comes from NBC Nightline 2007",

      "description": "2017 - CNN TV host and author Reza Aslan about his new spiritual travel series \u0022Believer.\u0022\n\n\u0022Believer\u0022 is a documentary series that follows Aslan as he experiences various religious traditions all over the world. Instead of just observing, Aslan immerses himself in customs and faith rituals around the globe, exploring 6 religions: Ultra-Orthodox Judaism in Israel, Scientology in the U.S., Hindu asceticism in India, Vodou in Haiti, Santa Muerte in Mexico, and an apocalyptic doomsday cult in Hawaii.\n\nDeutschlandfunk 2017\n\nCNN-Doku \u201EBeliever\u201C\nReligion als TV-Spektakel\n\nDie ARD sendet derzeit die Themenwoche \u201EGlauben\u201C \u2013 bei CNN lief gerade die Doku-Serie \u201EBeliever\u201C. Darin besucht Religionswissenschaftler Reza Aslan sechs kuriose Religionsgemeinschaften. Er tanzt mit ultraorthodoxen Juden durch Jerusalem oder oder isst mit einem Aghori-Asketen in Indien angeblich menschliches Gehirn. Der Skandal ist programmiert.\n\nReza Aslan hat \u00C4rger mit einem \u00E4lteren Asketen. Der droht, Aslan den Kopf abzuschneiden, wenn er nicht aufh\u00F6rt, so viele Fragen zu stellen. Reza Aslan ist US-amerikanischer Religionswissenschaftler und Medienprofi. Er ist als TV-Experte gefragt und produziert selbst Fernsehserien. Er hat zwei Bestseller geschrieben, einen \u00FCber den Islam, einen \u00FCber Jesus.\nHier ist Aslan als Reporter unterwegs f\u00FCr seine CNN-Doku-Serie \u201EBeliever\u201C \u2013 Glaubender. Der Privatsender CNN befasst sich immer wieder mit Religionsthemen. In der ersten Folge von \u201EBeliever\u201C besucht Reza Aslan die Aghori, eine Hindu-Gemeinschaft in Indien. Er erkl\u00E4rt:\n\u201EEs ist eine kleine asketische Bewegung. Sie stellen ihren Glauben unter Beweis, indem sie sich selbst verunreinigen. Sie reiben sich mit der Asche von Toten ein. Sie essen verrottende Leichen. Sie trinken ihren eigenen Urin.\u201C\nIsst der CNN-Reporter Menschenhirn?\nReza Aslans Anspruch ist es, Religionen nicht nur vorzustellen, sondern mitzumachen. Also scheint er, mit dem Asketen menschliches Gehirn zu essen. Zumindest sagt Aslans \u00DCbersetzer, der r\u00F6tliche Brocken, den Aslan sich in den Mund steckt, sei Menschenhirn. \u00DCberpr\u00FCfen kann der Zuschauer das nat\u00FCrlich nicht. Danach droht der Aghori-Asket, den Reporter mit seinen F\u00E4kalien bewerfen. So weit geht das Mitmachen dann aber doch nicht. Aslan rennt davon.\nAslan: \u201EPretty sure that is not the Aghori I was looking for.\u201C\nIn Indien den F\u00E4kalien gerade noch entkommen, trifft Aslan zuhause in den USA ein Shitstorm. Die einen emp\u00F6ren sich, dass CNN ein \u201EKannibalen-Sender\u201C sei. Andere kritisieren, Aslan stelle den Hinduismus klischeehaft dar. Eine Gruppe Hindus demonstriert vor einem CNN-B\u00FCro in Chicago. Tats\u00E4chlich wollten Aslan und CNN offenbar einen skandaltr\u00E4chtigen Auftakt f\u00FCr ihre \u201EBeliever\u201C-Reihe im Fernsehen.\n\u201EEin gro\u00DFes Tabu in Indien\u201C\nAber Skandal hin, Skandal her, Aslan macht klar: Bei den Aghori handelt es sich um eine Minderheit unter den Hindus. Die Aghori wollen mit den strengen hinduistischen Reinheitsregeln brechen \u2013 und zwar radikal. Das hat Folgen in der indischen Gesellschaft \u2013 positive Folgen. Denn auch andere Hindus \u00FCberdenken ihre Vorstellungen von Reinheit, erkl\u00E4rt Aslan:\n\u201ESie k\u00FCmmern sich um die Schwachen, Hungrigen und Armen. Sie fassen Kranke und Unber\u00FChrbare an. Ein gro\u00DFes Tabu in Indien. Sie machen das, weil sie glauben, dass Gott in jedem Menschen lebt. Nichts kann die Menschen von Gott trennen. Das ist eine sch\u00F6ne Idee.\u201C\nReza Aslan hat selbst eine bewegte religi\u00F6se Biografie. Er wuchs in einer schiitischen Familie auf, schloss sich als Jugendlicher evangelikalen Christen an und konvertierte als Student zur\u00FCck zum Islam. Da f\u00FChle er sich jetzt am meisten mit der Mystik verbunden, dem Sufismus.\nKosmopolitische Religiosit\u00E4t\nF\u00FCr Reza Aslan scheinen die unterschiedlichen Religionen letztlich auf dieselbe Wahrheit zu verweisen. Er verk\u00F6rpert eine liberale, kosmopolitische Religiosit\u00E4t. Mit dieser blickt er in den sechs Folgen von \u201EBeliever\u201C auf sechs kleinere Religionsgemeinschaften \u2013 manche w\u00FCrden sagen \u201ESekten\u201C. Auch auf Scientology.\nAslan: \u201EScientology ist wahrscheinlich die erfolgreichste neue amerikanische Religion der letzten hundert Jahre. Sie hat sich auf der ganzen Welt verbreitet.\u201C\nIn Deutschland wird kaum noch \u00FCber Scientology geredet. Was ganz und gar unvorstellbar ist hierzulande: Scientology als Religion ernst zu nehmen. Reza Aslan aber tut das. Er will zeigen, dass Scientology nicht immer gleich Scientology sei, indem er eine Abspaltung im israelischen Haifa besucht.\nScientology eine \u201Egro\u00DFe Religion der Welt\u201C?\nAslan verschweigt nicht, dass Scientology vorgeworfen wird, Druck auf seine Mitglieder auszu\u00FCben und ihnen das Geld aus der Tasche zu ziehen. Er kommt aber zu dem Fazit \u2013 f\u00FCr europ\u00E4ische Ohren vielleicht etwas \u00FCberraschend:\n\u201EWenn die Scientology-Kirche lernt, weniger Kontrolle auf ihre Mitglieder auszu\u00FCben, k\u00F6nnte sie in hundert Jahren eine der gro\u00DFen Religionen der Welt sein.\u201C",

      "description": "Marty Rathbun - Scientology\u0027s Infamous Defector Takes On David Miscavige | Scientologists at War (2013) | Full Film\n\nMeet Scientology\u0027s highest-level defector, Marty Rathbun. As the former Inspector General of Ethics in the organisation, Rathbun worked closely with its leader, David Miscavige, and celebrity follower Tom Cruise. Now he lives in small-town America: a man under siege. With incredible access, this doc captures the shocking measures the church will take to pressurise and discredit defectors. A rare insider-view of the highly secretive organisation.\n\n\nMark C. \u0022Marty\u0022 Rathbun (born 1957) is a former senior executive of the Church of Scientology who last held the post of Inspector General of the Religious Technology Center (RTC), the organization that is responsible for the protection and enforcement of all Dianetics and Scientology copyrights and trademarks.\n\nAs the inspector general, Rathbun led the RTC\u0027s international Inspector General Network, collectively responsible for internal maintenance and consistency of Scientology\u0027s practices and procedures in its organizations, and for ensuring perfect adherence to all Church policies as attributed to Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard.\n\nRathbun left the Church of Scientology in 2004 and became an independent Scientologist, later stating that he considers himself non-religious.\n\nSince 2016, Rathbun began criticizing former church members on his blog. He has also spoken out against prominent critics of Scientology, prompting speculation that he may have returned to the Church.\n\nScientologists at War\nA one-hour feature on Mark Rathbun titled Scientologists at War, directed by Joseph Martin and produced by Danielle Clark and Michael Simkin was broadcast on June 17, 2013, on British Channel Four.\n\nOn November 10, 2013, The Passionate Eye, an investigative TV series rebroadcast the program as a premiere in Canada on CBC Television, describing it as an investigation into \u0022the pressure tactics used to discredit and silence members who leave the church.\u0022\n\nHarassment claims\nIn 2013, Mark Rathbun\u0027s wife Monique, a non-Scientologist, filed suit against the Church of Scientology alleging four years of harassment by the church. The suit was withdrawn in May 2016, Monique saying, \u0022My husband and I have effectively achieved the primary purpose that the lawsuit was originally intended to serve by our own independent efforts\u0022. In October 2014, Rathbun filmed an encounter which showed three members of the church\u0027s top management abusing him at Los Angeles International Airport.\n\nMark Rathbun ist die Nummer zwei der Organisation. Dann steigt er aus, weil er die Gewalt nicht mehr ertr\u00E4gt. Ein Gespr\u00E4ch \u00FCber die Klauen der \u0022Church\u0022, die bis ins Wei\u00DFe Haus reichen.\n\nEin reuiger S\u00FCnder ist Mark Rathbun nicht. Er f\u00FChlt sich mehr wie Frankenstein, der ein Monster schuf, das er nicht mehr kontrollieren kann, sagt er. Er sieht mit Schrecken das Ergebnis.\n\nBraun gebrannt sitzt der 54-J\u00E4hrige in einem Hotel in Hamburg und erz\u00E4hlt von seiner Zeit bei Scientology. Mark Rathbun war einmal die Nummer zwei der Organisation, bis er vor sieben Jahren ausstieg. Jetzt ist er der gr\u00F6\u00DFte Widersacher der Sekte und ihres Anf\u00FChrers David Miscavige. Er will, dass Schluss ist mit dem \u201EWahnsinn\u201C. Auf seinem Internet-Blog ruft er dazu auf, eine Petition an die US-Regierung zu unterzeichnen: \u201EWir fordern, dass das Justizministerium unverz\u00FCglich eine Untersuchung der Aktivit\u00E4ten der Church of Scientology beginnt.\u201C\n\nAnfang September war Mark Rathbun zu Besuch in Hamburg. Er kam, um \u00F6ffentlich \u00FCber Scientology zu reden. Um \u201Eauszupacken\u201C, wie das Ursula Caberta nennt, die Hamburger Sektenbeauftragte, die ihn eingeladen hatte. Caberta war f\u00FCr Rathbun fr\u00FCher so etwas wie der Teufel pers\u00F6nlich.\n\nAndererseits hat sich Mark Rathbun zwar vom \u201ESystem Scientology\u201C gel\u00F6st, aber nicht von Scientology. Er sagt: \u201EIch bin und bleibe Scientologe.\u201C Er verdammt die Praxis, aber nicht die Ideologie des 1986 verstorbenen Sektengr\u00FCnders L. Ron Hubbard. Er ist ein Scientologe, der Scientology mit Scientology bek\u00E4mpft. Ein befehlsgewohnter Mann, der umwerfend nett und \u00E4tzend arrogant sein kann. Einer, der von sich sagt: \u201EIch bin kein Opfer. Ich habe Dinge getan, die schlecht waren. \n\nW\u00E4hrend der vier Tage in Deutschland hat Rathbun enth\u00FCllt, wie eine verh\u00E4ltnism\u00E4\u00DFig kleine extremistische Gruppe die Au\u00DFenpolitik des m\u00E4chtigsten Staates der Welt beeinflussen kann. \u201EWir haben ein Problem mit Deutschland gehabt\u201C, sagt er, \u201Eund das haben wir in Washington geregelt \u2013 mit sehr viel Geld.\u201C Immer wieder ger\u00E4t er beim Reden \u00FCber die \u201EChurch\u201C unwillk\u00FCrlich ins \u201EWir\u201C. \u201EWir sind in der Lage, einem Politiker Zehntausende Dollar zu spenden, ohne dass auff\u00E4llt, woher das Geld kommt. \n\nDer Trick ist: Hunderte von Scientologen zahlen auf das Konto ein. Niemand wei\u00DF, dass es Scientologen sind.\u201C Einsatz unbegrenzter Geldmittel \u2013 das ist der Schl\u00FCssel zu allem, sagt Rathbun.",

      "description": "We are the Children of Scientology\nWelcome! We\u2019re SO glad you\u2019re here!\n\nhttps://www.childrenofscientology.com\n\nMelissa Paris, Valeska\u2019s Sister, And Her Own Ordeal in Scientology\u2019s Cadet and Sea Orgs: \n\nForced to Marry at 16 with the son of the Scientology artist Gottfried Helnwein, Cyril Helnwein.\n\nby TONY ORTEGA\n\nIn December of 1996, Melissa Paris was 16 years old, and had been married for a few months to a man she says she was forced to wed. An unpleasant match, the marriage ended when Melissa left him \u2014 and Scientology\u2019s hardcore and controlling Sea Org \u2014 two years later.\n\nBut that was in the future. In the months after her wedding, she was in a unique position, and she knew it. Her husband, Cyril Helnwein, who was himself a teenaged Sea Org member of about 18, was from a wealthy family. The son of an internationally famous artist, Cyril had means. So, when they had returned, after the wedding, to grueling weeks of menial, unpaid labor that she had already endured for two years as an underaged Sea Org member at L. Ron Hubbard\u2019s legendary former home in England, Saint Hill Manor, she asked her rich young husband to grant her a wish.\n\nFly me to a ship. The Freewinds. For our honeymoon.\n\nMelissa asked this, not really out of a romantic notion, but knowing it might be her only chance to see her sister, Valeska, who had just been put aboard the ship against her will...\n\nAt 16, she had started to date a young man named Cyril Helnwein, who was a couple of years older. Then she found herself in the EPF, and her superiors got even more demanding of her.\n\nThe Estates Project Force is a sort of boot camp for Sea Org members, and it is something a Sea Org worker can be assigned to do again if they are not performing up to standards.\n\n\u201CI sucked. I don\u2019t conform or follow retarded orders,\u201D she says.\n\nBut she had few alternatives. She was separated from her family, who had their own Sea Org assignments to fulfill. Melissa says she was given an ultimatum: marry Cyril Helnwein, or get kicked out of the Sea Org.\n\n\u201CI was told that the only way I would be able to stay would be if I married him. I\u2019d actually broken up with him right before that and\u2026a high level executive told me that I needed to get back together with him ASAP. I was threatened with being dropped off in the middle of East Grinstead.\u201D\n\nWhy, I asked, were executives pushing her into the match?\n\n\u201CThe guy\u2019s father was pretty famous, and he wanted to marry me.\u201D\n\nCyril\u2019s father is Gottfried Helnwein, a well-known Viennese-born fine artist who these days splits his time between Ireland and Los Angeles. \n\nOver his career, Helnwein has avoided questions about his status as a Scientologist, but databases show that he\u2019s taken courses since at least 1978, and judging by plaques he\u2019s received, he\u2019s been a major donor.\n\nDespite his wealth, however, his son and daughter-in-law, as Sea Org members, lived a spartan lifestyle.\n\n\u201CAt the beginning, we lived in a room with bunk beds,\u201D Melissa says.\n\nA few months after their wedding in the summer of 1996, Melissa asked Cyril to take her on a Caribbean honeymoon.\n\u201CLike I said, his family was really wealthy. I asked him if we could go to the Freewinds for our honeymoon, so I could see my sister.\u201D In December, they went, and she turned 17 during their week on board.\n\n\u201CThe ship was in the \u2018ABC\u2019 islands,\u201D she says, referring to the three islands, Aruba, Bonaire, and Cura\u00E7ao, that the ship tends to visit, even to this day.\n\nShe knew her trip would be a complete surprise to her sister, who had been moved to the Freewinds in September of that year \u2014 against her will, Valeska says. She believes that church leader David Miscavige had her moved there to make sure she disconnected from her mother and was unable even to communicate with her. (\u201CThey took our passports, too,\u201D Melissa says, vouching for what Valeska has alleged, that every visitor on the ship gives up his or her passport when they arrive.)\n\nOn the ship, Valeska worked as a waitress for her first six years, and was never able to leave the vessel without an escort. And even though her sister had flown so far to see her, during the week Melissa and Cyril were on board, they rarely got to see Valeska.\n\u201CShe would come at her dinner time. And during the week she got one half-day off.\u201D Just one half day, I asked? \u201CYeah, half a day.\u201D\n\nValeska, 19, and her sister Melissa, 17, said goodbye at the end of the week. They wouldn\u2019t see each other again until 2009.\n\nMelissa and Cyril returned to England, but Melissa says she was miserable in her marriage, and in her work. A little more than a year after her trip to the Freewinds, she began planning to leave. She told her superiors that she wanted out, and she convinced her father, who lived in Chicago, to fly her out in May, 1998. She was finally done with the Sea Org.\n\n\u201CI didn\u2019t tell Cyril I was leaving,\u201D she says. She just left him without saying a word...",

This photo was provided by the Church of Scientology as a handout.\n\nEmily Armstrong Over Alleged Danny Masterson Support\n\u201CDo your fans know about your friend Danny Masterson? Your rapist friend,\u201D Mars Volta musician wrote highlighting her ties to Scientology\n\nTHE MARS VOLTA\u2019S Cedric Bixler-Zavala recirculated a sharp criticism of Linkin Park\u2019s new vocalist, Emily Armstrong, over her ties to the Church of Scientology and alleged support of convicted rapist Danny Masterson.\n\n\u201CDo your fans know about your friend Danny Masterson? Your rapist friend,\u201D Bixler-Zavala wrote in a comment posted on the Instagram page of Armstrong\u2019s band, Dead Sara, last year. \n\nBixler-Zavala\u2019s wife, Chrissie Carnell-Bixler, was one of several women who accused Masterson of sexual assault. While the actor was not convicted on the charges tied to her allegations, he was found guilty on charges brought by two other Jane Doe accusers. Carnell-Bixler is also part of a civil suit against Masterson, who was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison. \n\nBixler-Zavala and Carnell-Bixler are also both former Scientologists, and they\u2019ve long accused the Church of Scientology of harassing them over their pursuit of justice against Masterson, a prominent Scientologist himself. Armstrong has ties to Scientology, too: There\u2019s a photo (featured above) of her and Bixler-Zavala at the Scientology Celebrity Centre in 2013 for a gala celebrating the Church\u2019s 44th anniversary; and in 2020, Armstrong showed up to the courthouse ostensibly to support Masterson during his trial (via journalist/Scientology watchdog Tony Ortega.)\n\nLast year, Bixler-Zavala left a comment on Dead Sara\u2019s Instagram page, which he screen grabbed and reposted on his Stories following the announcement that she\u2019d joined Linkin Park. (It appears Bixler-Zavala has since deleted the story, but it\u2019s still up on Carnell-Bixler\u2019s Stories.)\n\n\u201CI\u2019m surprised none of you wrote a letter on Danny Mastersons behalf since your corny ass singer showed up to support him in the prelims,\u201D Bixler-Zavala said. \u201CRemember Emily? Remember how your fellow scientologist goon squad surrounded one of the Jane Doe\u2019s when she was trying to leave the elevators? The court sheriffs had to escort her away from your awful cult\u2026 How do you reconcile the homophobia found in the teachings of [L. Ron Hubbard] book Dianetics?\u201D (A rep for Linkin Park and Armstrong did not immediately return Rolling Stone\u2019s request for comment.) \n\nIn a Story of her own, Carnell-Bixler called Armstrong a \u201Chardcore Scientologist who supported convicted serial rapist both in and out of court\u201D (referring to Masterson, though not mentioning him by name). \u201CEmily Armstrong is a true believer of the Scientology cult/criminal organization that engages in human and child trafficking, child and elder abuse, the coverups of countless [sexual assaults] on children and adults.\u201D (The Church has faced numerous trafficking and abuse claims over the years, which it has denied.) \n\n\nEmily Armstrong und Scientology und sein Geheimdienst OSA - Die dunkle Wahrheit \u00FCber das Linkin Park Comeback\nWissenswert - 1,59 Mio.

Kaum hat die Band am Freitag (06. September 2024) ihre Reunion verk\u00FCndet, gab es bereits die ersten kritischen Stimmen.

Die Tram rattert Richtung Messe, wo sie ganz in der N\u00E4he wohnt.\nDie 35-j\u00E4hrige Schweizerin war 13 Jahre lang Mitglied der Scientology-Sekte. Die Mutter ihrer besten Freundin hatte sie angeworben, als sie mit 15 Jahren in einer Lebenskrise steckte. Die aus den USA stammende internationale Organisation gibt vor mit ihren scientologischen Kursen und Trainingsmethoden, Zitat \u0022ungenutztes geistiges Potenzial und wahre F\u00E4higkeiten\u0022 im Menschen freisetzen zu k\u00F6nnen.\nGehorsam und Unterordnung spielen bei den Scientologen eine zentrale Rolle. Was die \u00FCbergeordneten Scientologen von ihren Untergebenen verlangen, wird gemacht. Und zwar rund um die Uhr, an sieben Tagen der Woche.\nO-Ton 05 Sabrina David:\nEs gibt einen Stundenplan in Scientology. In der ersten Zeit, wo ich Mitarbeiter war, ging der von 9 Uhr morgens bis 11 Uhr abends, jeden Tag. Und wenn man sich dann darangehalten hat, dann wurdest du angerufen. Und wenn du nicht erreicht wurdest, dann ist jemand zu dir rausgefahren und hat dich reingeholt. Oder wenn man zu fr\u00FCh ging abends, nicht bis um elf blieb, sondern um halb elf ging, dann hat man das auch kontrolliert.\nSprecherin 1:\nIn Deutschland werden die Scientologen vom Verfassungsschutz \u00FCberwacht. Zu Recht, wie Sabrina David findet. Den gr\u00F6\u00DFten Teil ihrer Scientology-Zeit hat sie in\nBerlin verbracht, wo die Sekte ein repr\u00E4sentatives Geb\u00E4ude mit viel Glas und Stahl unterh\u00E4lt. Sabrina David hat den Aufenthalt dort als extrem repressiv erlebt. Jeder bespitzelte jeden. Privatheit gab es nicht. \u00DCber die moralische Reinheit der Mitglieder wachten sogenannte Ethik-Beauftragte.\nO-Ton 06 Sabrina David:\nIn Scientology muss man alles aufschreiben \u00FCber andere Personen. Wenn man zum Beispiel gesehen hat, der Peter ging gestern 5 Minuten vorher, bevor er gehen darf, raus, dann bist du verpflichtet als Mitarbeiter und als Scientologe das aufzuschreiben. Wenn du das n\u00E4mlich nicht tust, und man findet raus, dass du das gewusst hast, dann droht dir das gleiche Schicksal wie diesem armen Mitarbeiter.\nUnd deswegen wird alles aufgeschrieben. Und dann wirst du halt reingerufen und musst dich da hinsetzen mit so einem Ethik-Beauftragten. Und dann fragt der so: \u0060Ja, hier habe ich den Bericht bekommen \u2013 was sagst du dazu?\u201C. Und dann musst du Stellung dazu nehmen. Und je nachdem, was drinsteht, kriegst du eine Handhabung.\nSprecherin 1:\nSabrina David musste auch eigene vermeintliche Fehler aufschreiben und beichten. Mithilfe eines L\u00FCgendetektors pr\u00FCfte die Ethik, ob sie auch wirklich alles offengelegt hatte. Selbst, wenn sie krank sind, m\u00FCssen Scientologen gehorchen. Arztbesuche sind unerw\u00FCnscht, viele Medikamente sind verboten.\nO-Ton 07 Sabrina David:\nSchmerzmittel, Antibiotikum und das ganze Zeug durfte man nur nehmen, wenn man die Erlaubnis hatte von der Person, die sozusagen dich \u00FCberwacht, was dein K\u00F6rper und dein Geist miteinander zu tun haben. [Da musste man die Erlaubnis holen.]\nSprecherin 1:\nSabrina David hat in ihrer Scientology-Zeit zwei Weisheitszahn-OPs, eine\nNierenbeckenentz\u00FCndung und etliche Blasenentz\u00FCndungen ohne Medikamente durchgestanden. Weil sie trotz einer 90-Stunden-Woche fast kein Geld verdiente, a\u00DF sie kaum. Als sie ausstieg, wog sie gerade noch 46 Kilogramm. Warum hat sie den menschenverachtenden und krankmachenden Befehlen so lange gehorcht?\nO-Ton 08 Sabrina David:\nIch war halt die ganzen Jahre \u00FCberzeugt, dass das, was ich mache, dass ich damit dem Planeten helfe. Dass ich zur Kl\u00E4rung des Planeten beitrage. Dass die Technologie von Scientology die Menschen befreit. Ja, das hab\u2018 ich halt geglaubt\u2026 ich ging halt davon aus, dass ich den Menschen helfe. Sei das jetzt durch pers\u00F6nliche Gespr\u00E4che oder durch Verkaufen von B\u00FCchern oder Rekrutieren von neuen Mitarbeitern. Die Absicht war: \u0060Ja, ich helfe diesen Leuten\u00B4.\nSprecherin 1:\nWer gehorsam ist, sieht darin oft einen Nutzen. Die Scientology-Sekte versprach der 15-j\u00E4hrigen Sabrina David, dass sie die Welt zu einem besseren und friedlichen Ort machen kann, wenn sie sich den Regeln und Befehlen von Scientology beugt. Eine L\u00FCge, wie sie heute wei\u00DF.",

      "title": "Michelle Leclair -  Escaping Scientology and Fighting for the Woman I Love",
      "description": "Perfectly Clear: Escaping Scientology and Fighting for the Woman I Love \n\n10.09.2018\n Michelle LeClair, former scientologist and author of \u201CPerfectly Clear,\u201D shares her story of leaving the church after having been a member since 1989. In her book, LeClair claims that government investigations into her and her business partner were instigated by the Church of Scientology, a claim the church, as well as an official for the California Dept. of Business Oversight denies.\n\n-------------------------------------------\nThe revelatory memoir by former \u0022poster girl for Scientology\u0022 Michelle LeClair about her defection from the Church, her newly accepted sexual identity, and the lengths to which Scientology went to silence it.\n\nFor years, Michelle LeClair, former President of Scientology\u0027s international humanitarian organization, tried to reconcile her sexual orientation with the anti-gay ideology of the church. Michelle finally ends her horrific marriage, finds the love of her life, a woman, and ultimately leaves the Church. But the split comes at a terrible price. Her once pristine reputation is publicly dragged through the mud, the police raid her home, her ex-husband tries to gain full custody of their children, and the multi-million dollar business she built from scratch is utterly destroyed.\n\nIn this tell-all memoir, Michelle offers an insider\u0027s perspective on Scientology\u0027s pervasive influence, secret rituals, and ruthless practices for keeping members in line. It\u0027s a story of self-acceptance, of finding the strength and courage to stand up for your emotional freedom, and of love prevailing.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nEscaping Scientology: Woman writes about ordeal after discovering her \u0027truth\u0027\nNedra Rhone Tribune News Service  |  The Daytona Beach News-Journal\nMichelle LeClair was just a teenager when she was first introduced to the Church of Scientology. She had moved from Norman, Okla., to Los Angeles where she felt adrift and alone, the perfect conditions, she said, for being recruited into what she now identifies as a cult with diminished power.\n\n\u201CNobody cares what the Church of Scientology has to say anymore. They are like the little man behind the curtain who doesn\u2019t have the strength and power he thought he had. Everyone is aware this is a cult that is built on lies\u201D.\n\nAfter more than two decades as a high-donor member of the church, LeClair, 45, said the organization sought to destroy her and her livelihood when she came out as a gay woman. The realization that she would not be accepted as her authentic self led to her defection in 2010. LeClair, who has lived in Atlanta since 2015 with her music-producer partner, Tena Clark and LeClair\u2019s children from a previous marriage, details her journey in a new memoir, \u201CPerfectly Clear,\u201D \n\nThe church also denied that it has any official position on homosexuality. \u201CInstead of accepting responsibility for her actions, Ms. LeClair appears to be peddling fiction,\u201D said the statement. \u201CWe hope Ms. LeClair can someday find solace.\u201D\n\nLeClair wanted to share her story to expose the Church of Scientology and its treatment of gay people, said LeClair who believes the church subjected her to gay conversion therapy as a teenager.\n\nSince moving to metro Atlanta, LeClair and Clark have worked to rebuild. LeClair was concerned when in 2016, the Church of Scientology opened a location in Sandy Springs. \u201CI felt very sad for Atlanta that this cult has made its way into such an amazing town,\u201D she said. \u201CI don\u2019t feel it is my right to tell anybody what their religion should be but you have a very dangerous cult that just landed in your backyard and that is very concerning to me.\u201D\n\nClark has also supported the family financially while LeClair has pondered her next career move. An entrepreneur at heart, she has been building a non-toxic luxury beauty brand that will launch next year. And now that she is able to regain her insurance license, she is also considering a return to the industry.\n\nLeClair has dedicated proceeds from her book to a trust for her insurance clients. She said she hopes her story will help anyone who has struggled to be their authentic self, to walk out of an abusive relationship, to escape Scientology or to rebuild after failure. \u201CI want people to know we have a choice,\u201D she said.\n\nAs for Scientology, that is a chapter that is finally in her past. \u201CI look at Scientology as something that enveloped my life for many years, that stole my ability to explore my sexuality, that forced me to live a life of sorrow and pain and I refuse to let it define me today,\u201D LeClair said. \u201CI have a new definition of success and that is how hard do I love? How many kisses do I give my partner and my children every day? What am I doing in the world to give back for the second chance that I have?\u201D",

Security gates have been installed which operate 24 hours a day, and the Church plans to distribute swipe cards to residents. All of these security measures were implemented prior to receiving council approval.\nLynne Saville, a councilor at Willoughby City Council in Sydney, and a resident in the area of 35 years, says she and her neighbours feel they\u0027ve been locked out.\n\u0022The residents in the area upset about the security measures that have been imposed. The people around here have been very confused and outraged really,\u0022 Councilor Saville told A Current Affair.\n\u0022The neighbours have always had a high sense of ownership about this property, they\u0027ve used it, they\u0027ve walked through it, they\u0027ve defended the creek, done bush regeneration here.\u0022\nBefore the block belonged to the Church of Scientology, it was the National Acoustic Laboratory, and was Commonwealth land. Walking trails connect the church\u0027s site to the adjoining Lane Cove National Park and Blue Gum Reserve, and members of the public have always had access.\n\u0022I think it\u0027s very unfortunate that the Church are now trying to change very reasonable conditions of consent to which they agreed at the time,\u0022 said Ms Saville.\nChurch staff are hoping followers from Taiwan, Indonesia, New Zealand and part of Asia will be able to worship at the centre as a \u0027beacon of freedom throughout the region\u0027. \nIn a media release, Mr Miscavige was described the facility as \u0027perfectly perfect\u0027. Some local residents had opposed the development in 2014 claiming it would disturb the neighbourhood. \nThe sprawling 145,000 square foot facility comes despite reports the religion has waned in popularity in Australia.   \nThe 2011 Census found little more than 2,100 Australians called themselves Scientologists. Church president Vicki Dunstan said the figure didn\u0027t reflect the church\u0027s membership. \nThe construction of the new \u0027continental base\u0027 also comes ahead of the release of a book about the religion in Australia by ABC journalist Steve Cannane. \nDubbed Fair Game, a blurb for the book says it will tell the \u0027fascinating story of Australia\u0027s vital involvement in the secretive, powerful and punitive cult\u0027.Facilities include 60 \u0027auditing\u0027 or spiritual counselling rooms - where technology called \u0027e-meters\u0027 are used; a chapel; grand auditorium; production studio; and an office devoted to L. Ron Hubbard.\n\n\nA Current Affair covers the realms of politics, crime, human rights, science, technology, celebrities and entertainment - all investigated by a dedicated team.

      "description": "How L.R. Hubbards criminal Scientology cult tried to bring down the great journalist Paulette Cooper.\n\nThe Unbreakable Miss Lovely\n\nIn 1971 Paulette Cooper wrote a scathing book about the Church of Scientology. Desperate to shut the book down, Scientology unleashed on her one of the most sinister personal campaigns the free world has ever known. The onslaught, which lasted years, drove her to the brink of suicide. The story of Paulette\u2019s terrifying ordeal is told in full for the first time in The Unbreakable Miss Lovely. It reveals the shocking details of the darkest chapter in Scientology\u2019s checkered history, which ended with senior members in prison, and the organization\u2019s reputation permanently damaged.\n\n\u201CA brilliant exposition of how a child who escaped the Nazis grew up to be hunted by the Church of Scientology\u201D \u2013 BBC journalist John Sweeney\n\n\u201CA page-turner packed with barely believable facts. The details are worthy of John le Carre\u201D \u2013 Jon Atack, author of A Piece of Blue Sky\n\nNathan Rabin, The A.V. Club: \u201CBefore Tony Ortega\u2019s The Unbreakable Miss Lovely, Cooper\u2019s story had never been told in full. It is one of the most remarkable and unlikely narratives in the sprawling field of Scientology expos\u00E9s. Ortega\u2019s specialty is his ability to contextualize Cooper\u2019s soap-opera life within the raging currents of history. Cooper embodied her times: She was a child of World War II and the Holocaust, an orphan of one of the 20th century\u2019s greatest tragedies who grew up to be the epitome of the chic New York career woman\u2026Scientology\u2019s persecution of Cooper comes to feel like a strange echo of the Watergate controversy riveting the nation at the same time. People who profess to be the victims of sinister, far-reaching conspiracies are often seen as crazy, but Cooper genuinely was the victim of a sinister, far-reaching conspiracy\u2026In the kind of twist that fills The Unbreakable Miss Lovely and makes it such a compulsively readable page-turner, Cooper discovers too late that, like far too many people in her life, [L. Ron] Hubbard Jr. (or \u201CNibs\u201D as he was known) was not what he appeared to be, and was probably a double agent working against Cooper on Scientology\u2019s behalf\u2026Cooper should have been destroyed by Scientology. But she proved astonishingly brave and bold. The book\u2019s title proves appropriate both because Cooper is model gorgeous but also unbreakable, with a spirit strong enough to stand up to an entire organization out to destroy her and everything she stands for. In that respect, the book is oddly inspiring.\u201D\n\nKirkus Reviews: \u201COrtega, in his nonfiction debut, describes a journalist\u2019s decadeslong battle against the Church of Scientology. There have been assertions of horror stories involving the Church of Scientology in a plethora of books, articles, documentaries, and interviews with ex-members. This new account focuses on Paulette Cooper, one of the first journalists to investigate what many see as the questionable moral practices of L. Ron Hubbard\u2019s religion\u2014and one of the first people, he says, to become a target of its vengeance. In a 1969 article in Queen magazine and later in a 1971 book, The Scandal of Scientology, Cooper offered a damning exploration of the church and its practices. \u201CMore than previous writers,\u201D notes Ortega, \u201CPaulette focused on the harassment of those who dared to speak up about Scientology, whether they\u2019d been in the church or not.\u201D In response to her words, Ortega says, the church set out to destroy her life with an unprecedented yearslong campaign of litigation, defamation, intimidation, and harassment that pushed the journalist nearly to the point of suicide. In Cooper, Ortega finds the perfect foil to what he portrays as the secretive, suppressive machinations of Scientology: she\u2019s a nearly archetypical newshound, savvy and scoop-obsessed, with a colorful history of committing fully to her work. For example, Ortega shares one anecdote of Cooper stowing away on a cruise ship for the sake of a travel piece, hiding in plain sight and stashing a change of clothes in a barroom piano. This book is far from just another look into the familiar, if terrifying, alleged tactics of the Church of Scientology; it\u2019s a profile of a fascinating reporter making her bones and taking her lumps in the fickle world of 1970s magazine journalism. Plucky, self-possessed, and fearless in the face of the many threats\u2013legal and otherwise\u2013against her reputation and person, Cooper is a figure whose name is worth knowing. A thrilling account of a reporter\u2019s duel with a controversial church.\u201D\n\nA recent Amazon 5-star review: \u201CI started the book during a vacation to Florida and my wife started reading it out loud while we drove. We both got hooked and the book kept us entertained during the entire trip to and from Florida. We were spellbound and had a hard time putting the book down. It was great entertainment. I\u2019ve been curious about the Cult for many years and this book enlightened me.\u201D",

      "description": "Valeska Paris also alleges physical and sexual abuse of children was common, and that she \u2018walked in on an adult Sea Org member, who was responsible for the children, masturbating on a boy\u2019s bed.\u2019\n\nEx-Scientologists Came Forward with Shocking Child Trafficking Claims. Now They Say They\u2019re Being Stalked.\n\nDaily Beast:\nKate Briquelet\nSenior Reporter\n\nUpdated Aug. 07, 2022 11:38AM EDT / Published Aug. 06, 2022 7:59PM \n\nVALESKA PARIS\n\nAccording to the amended complaint, Valeska Paris was indoctrinated into Scientology from the age of 4 by her parents, both of whom were Scientologists. The 44-year-old recalls enduring oppressive Scientology training at a young age that included being \u201Cscreamed at, verbally abused, and forced to listen to graphic descriptions of sexual content for hours at a time to condition her not to be upset or show any visible reaction and retain her composure in the face of verbal assault.\u201D\n\nParis alleges that by the age of 6, her parents enrolled her in Cadet Org, where she was forced to sign a billion-year contract pledging to serve Sea Org.\n\nShe lived in Cadet Org dormitories at Stonelands, in England, near Scientology\u2019s U.K. base, Saint Hill. \u201CValeska spoke only French and felt isolated from the other children and adults who spoke only English, until she learned to speak English,\u201D the lawsuit states, adding that she was upset to be separated from her mom and that adult Sea Org members punished her for being \u201Cdramatic.\u201D They allegedly forced her to wash pots and pans.\n\nAt the facility, the lawsuit alleges, Paris and other children were forced to work five hours, unpaid, cleaning the premises and providing childcare for newborns. The complaint adds that kids were permitted one day off every two weeks, and if they got sick, they were denied medical care; instead they were excused from work and isolated in their dorm. According to the lawsuit, Paris was denied medical treatment when she contracted mumps.\n\nParis also alleges physical and sexual abuse of children was common, and that she \u201Cwalked in on an adult Sea Org member, who was responsible for the children, masturbating on a boy\u2019s bed.\u201D She also claims that when she was 11, a 27-year-old male Sea Org member ordered her to lie on top of him in her bed because he was hiding from Sea Org staff. (She claims she was punished for reporting both of these encounters to an adult.)\n\nIn the amended complaint, Paris says that when she was 12, her Sea Org superior \u201Cordered her\u201D into a room with him to confess the \u201Ccrimes\u201D she had committed\u2014these being \u201Calleged sexual thoughts she had.\u201D When she branded him a \u201Cpervert,\u201D she was punished with \u201Clower conditions\u201D for a period of six months.\n\nOne of the more shocking new allegations in the amended complaint concerns Paris\u2019 secretive relationship with another Sea Org member, Chris Guider. She says that the two were married in March 2009 in a roadside ceremony, though because they did so without the blessing of their superiors, they were banished to a \u201Ca room with only broken-down furniture and no mattress on the bed,\u201D and Paris was physically dragged by a senior Sea Org officer to clean out \u201Cmaggot-infested garbage cans.\u201D Since Sea Org members were not permitted to have children, Paris alleges in the complaint that she \u201Cpurposely became pregnant.\u201D Though Paris contends there was a policy in place of \u201Cforcing women in Sea Org to have abortions,\u201D Paris refused because she knew such action would prevent her ability to leave.\n\nDuring her pregnancy, Paris maintains that she was \u201Cdenied any prenatal care\u201D and still subjected to \u201Cwork long hours and subsist on the squash pies, cereal, stale bread and other poor-quality food fed to Sea Org members.\u201D She says that because of her pregnancy, her fellow Sea Org members \u201Cshamed\u201D her and refused to speak with her, so she ate her meals alone in her tiny room. After six weeks, she \u201Cbegan bleeding\u201D and went to the emergency room, where she suffered a miscarriage.\n\nSea Org, Paris alleges in the complaint, finally allowed her to leave following her miscarriage\u2014though their harassment of her was far from over. Paris remembers taking a trip to Florida to visit her mother, who had previously fled Sea Org, where they were befriended by an undercover member of the Office of Special Affairs (OSA), or Scientology\u2019s intelligence wing. This covert OSA agent managed to convince Paris and her mother to allow her to stay with them, and was \u201Csecretly reporting their moves and conversations back to OSA.\u201D Not long after, Paris\u2019 father \u201Ccontacted her and abruptly informed her that he was disconnecting from her.\u201D Paris was confused because she\u2019d only confided in her mother about what she\u2019d been through.\n\nBecause of all these incidents, which Paris says is \u201Cconsistent with OSA\u2019s history of \u2018fair game\u2019 intimidation operations,\u201D she \u201Clives in constant fear that she or her family will be harmed.\u201D",

      "description": "Scientology chief\u0027s daughter attacks church\n\nABC News (Australia)\n19.05.2010\n\nScarlett Hanna, the daughter of the president of the Church of Scientology in Australia, Vicki Dunstan, has spoken out against the organisation.\n\nIn an exclusive interview on ABC News, Scarlett Hanna has detailed life growing up in the former Cadet Org: a group set up for the children of Scientology\u0027s elite unit, the Sea Org.\n\n\u0022The best way I can describe it is cattle,\u0022 she said. \u0022We were property of the organisation.\u0022\n\nShe said children of Sea Org members rarely had contact with their parents, lived in separate homes and were granted only 20 minutes each night with their parents.\n\n\u0022I can\u0027t describe it. It was just an incredibly lonely childhood. I had no-one to talk to or to look after to me, or to ask me how I was after school or any of those things that most of us take for granted,\u0022 Ms Hanna said.\n\n\nScientology chief\u0027s daughter attacks church\n\nThe daughter of the president of the Church of Scientology in Australia has spoken out against the organisation, describing it as toxic and accusing the church of tearing some families apart.\n\nIn an exclusive interview on ABC 1\u0027s Lateline, Scarlett Hanna has detailed life growing up in the former Cadet Org: a group set up for the children of Scientology\u0027s elite unit, the Sea Org.\n\n\u0022The best way I can describe it is cattle,\u0022 Ms Hanna said of their treatment. We were property of the organisation.\u0022\n\nMs Hanna is the only child of Vicki Dunstan, president of the Church of Scientology in Australia, and Mark Hanna, a former Asian/Pacific director of public affairs for the church.\n\nShe claims children of Sea Org members rarely had contact with their parents, lived in separate homes and were granted only 20 minutes each night with their parents.\n\n\u0022I can\u0027t describe it. It was just an incredibly lonely childhood. I had no-one to talk to or to look after to me, or to ask me how I was after school or any of those things that most of us take for granted,\u0022 Ms Hanna told ABC 1\u0027s Lateline.\n\nSarah McClintock, a current member of the Sea Org, grew up with Ms Hanna and rejects the allegations.\n\n\u0022What she is saying I did not experience. I don\u0027t know where she is coming from with such things. It really doesn\u0027t make any sense to me because I grew up with her. I was there with her and I think people are giving her things to say,\u0022 she said.\n\nSheila Huber, a former Sea Org member, says she witnessed poor treatment of children at the Church of Scientology in Los Angeles.\n\nMs Huber, a former executive establishment officer for the organisation, cared for children in the Cadet Org when she was 16 years old.\n\n\u0027Terrified of sunlight\u0027\n\nShe says she looked after around 30 infants all crammed into a one-bedroom apartment.\n\nMs Huber claims the children were only allowed outside once in eight months and they were terrified by the experience.\n\n\u0022They spent so much time in their cribs, day after day, night after night, that they wouldn\u0027t go in any space larger than the size of their cribs. They were terrified. They were terrified of the sunlight,\u0022 she said.\n\nMs Hanna says the Department of Community Services in New South Wales twice visited Cadet Org homes when she was a child.\n\n\u0022The furniture was dismantled by a division within the Sea Org that deals with labour and the kids were sent out for the day so it would appear they were living according to crowding laws,\u0022 she said.\n\nMs McClintock says she has no recollection of this occurring.\n\nMs Hanna says the worst part of her experience was the separation from her parents.\n\nHer father Mark Hanna was sent to the Church of Scientology\u0027s rehabilitation unit, the RPF, in the United States when she was a child.\n\n\u0022He was gone for several years probably two or three years,\u0022 Ms Hanna said.\n\n\u0022I lost my father. I had no-one to talk to - it was very humiliating.\u0022\n\nVirginia Stewart from the Church of Scientology in Sydney denies the church routinely separates family members.\n\n\u0022I don\u0027t actually agree it\u0027s been routinely done and I think in that instance in that family you would have to speak to the father and the mother about why they lived like that, why they chose to take that action,\u0022 she said.\n\nBut Ms Huber, who spent a year separated from her five-year-old boy while in the RPF, says she had little choice.\n\n\u0022I got surrounded by eight grown men, grown Sea Org members, and in a circle around me, telling me I am now going to the RPF,\u0022 she said.\n\nMs Hanna says she decided to speak out following the screening of a Four Corners story on Scientology on ABC1 earlier this year.\n\n\u0022I just think the church needs to take some accountability for what it was involved in, maybe apologise to some of these people that have had such traumatising experiences,\u0022 she said.\n\nThe Cadet Org no longer exists in the Church of Scientology. Ms Hanna\u0027s parents declined to be interviewed by Lateline.",

In The United States, Narconon is under investigation following several deaths at the Headquarters in Oklahoma. \nReport here: https://youtu.be/8gFqWh2dtOI\n\nNarconon costs around $30,000 per stay and has no medical certification. The group was recently ordered by authorities in Victoria to stop claiming that its program works and to publicly state that there is no medical or scientific evidence that it is effective. ORDER HERE: http://bit.ly/1NQxrQn\nThe program, invented by Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard, consists of several weeks spent in a sauna and a strict diet of mostly water, Niacin and vitamins.

Do you want to be supporting an organisation that defrauds, that blackmails, that falsely imprisons?\u0022 he asked.\n\n\u0022Because on the balance of evidence provided by victims of scientology you probably are.\u0022\n\nSenator Xenophon told Parliament the Church of Scientology is a criminal organisation that hides behind its \u0022so-called religious beliefs\u0022.\n\n\u0022The letters received by me which were written by former followers in Australia contain extensive allegations of crimes and abuses that are truly shocking,\u0022 he said.\n\n\u0022Crimes against them and crimes they say they were coerced into committing.\n\n\u0022There are allegations of false imprisonment, coerced abortions and embezzlement of church funds, of physical violence and intimidation, blackmail and the widespread and deliberate abuse of information.\u0022\n\nSenator Xenophon says the allegations are shocking.\n\n\u0022It is alleged that information about suspicious deaths and child abuse has been destroyed and one follower has admitted that he was coerced by the organisation into perjuring himself into deaths of his two daughters,\u0022 he said.\n\n\u0022These victims of Scientology claim it is an abusive manipulative and violent organisation.\u0022\n\nIn a statement, the Church of Scientology says Senator Xenophon has abused Parliamentary privilege and is being pressured by disgruntled former members who are unreliable witnesses.\n\nPETER JEAN\nPOLITICAL REPORTER - The Advertiser\nApril 8, 2015 \nSenator Nick Xenophon asks regulator to consider revoking Church of Scientology\u2019s registration as a charity\n\nA FEDERAL regulator has been asked to consider revoking the Church of Scientology\u2019s registration as a charity in the wake of a damning documentary about the religion.\n\nProminent Scientologist and Hollywood actor John Travolta on Wednesday rejected claims in the American documentary Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief that he was being held captive by the church which holds a \u201Cdirt file\u2019\u2019 on him.\n\nIndependent Senator Nick Xenophon is concerned by allegations in the film and has asked the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission to urgently review the church\u2019s registration.\n\n\u201CThese allegations included that the Church of Scientology ... tortures its members, that it has stolen US Government documents and requires current members to cut all ties with friends and family members,\u2019\u2019 Senator Xenophon said in a letter to the charities commission.\n\nHe said he was deeply concerned about the harmful influence the global Church of Scientology could be having on its Australian branches.\n\nIn 2009, Senator Xenophon used parliamentary privilege to reveal allegations from former members that the Church of Scientology had engaged in forced imprisonment, coerced abortions, physical violence and blackmail.\nActing Charities and Not-for-profits commissioner David Locke confirmed that the commission had received Senator Xenophon\u2019s letter and would respond directly to him.\n\nThe commission has revoked the registration of 10 charities since 2014.\n\nChurch of Scientology president Vicki Dunstan rejected the claims made in the film, including the allegations of torture.\n\nMs Dunstan said members of the church were encouraged to have friendships with people of other faiths.\n\nHigh-profile Scientologists include Travolta and fellow Hollywood star Tom Cruise.\n\nIn an interview with a US newspaper, Travolta said the Going Clear documentary was the product of people who were disgruntled with their experiences with Scientology.\n\nTravolta said he had personally found the church to be \u201Cnothing but brilliant\u2019\u2019, including after the sudden death of his son Jett in 2009\n\n\u201CI\u2019ve been so happy with my (Scientology) experience in the last 40 years that I really don\u2019t have anything to say that would shed light on (a documentary) so decidedly negative,\u2019\u2019 Mr Travolta told the Tampa Bay Times.\n\n\u201CI\u2019ve been brought through storms that were insurmountable, and (Scientology has) been so beautiful for me, that I can\u2019t even imagine attacking it.\u201D",

      "description": "Vicky Dunstan - The president of Scientology Australia and Asia talks about the cult, from its founding to the practices done within.\nThis story originally aired on March 14th 2010, on Seven News Australia Sunday Night.\n\nSpeech by Senator Xenophon Against The Criminal Organization Scientology\n\nSenator Nick Xenophon in 2009\nIn November 2009, independent senator Nick Xenophon spoke in the Australian parliament about the organisation, describing it as a \u0022criminal organisation\u0022 and saying that he had letters from former followers which included \u0022claims of abuse, false imprisonment and forced abortion\u0022. His staff interviewed a number of people who made the claims. Xenophon called for a parliamentary enquiry to investigate the church\u0027s activities and its tax-exempt status.\nIn March 2010, Xenophon\u0027s call for an inquiry was \u0022overwhelmingly rejected\u0022 by the Australian Senate, the senators voting 33 to 6 against with 37 abstentions; Xenophon said he would \u0022continue to push for an inquiry when parliament reconvenes in May\u0022. Xenophon provided further details of his position when he spoke to his motion and Australian Greens senators Milne and Brown also spoke in support. Liberal Party Senator Eric Abetz and Cory Bernardi spoke against.\nOn 22 June 2010, Senator David Feeney presented the report Persons referred to in the Senate \u2013 Ms Vicki Dunstan on behalf of the Church of Scientology Australia in parliament and moved that it be adopted. The report was a response \u0022to comments made by Senators Xenophon, Milne and Bob Brown in the Senate on 11 and 18 March 2010 during debates to refer matters relating to the Church of Scientology\u0022 and was tabled to provide \u0022a right of reply ... to persons who claim to have been adversely affected by being referred to, either by name or in such a way as to be readily identified, in the Senate\u0022. The effect of tabling the report was to enter the Church of Scientology\u0027s response to senators Xenophon, Christine Milne and Bob Brown, in full, into Hansard, the permanent public record of the Parliament of Australia.\nOn 2 May 2012, the speech caused controversy for reasons unrelated to Scientology when it was published by the Malaysian newspaper the New Straits Times in an article titled \u0022Observer under scrutiny\u0022 on its website with the word \u0022Scientology\u0022 replaced with \u0022Islam\u0022 to give the impression that Xenophon made an anti-Islam speech in Parliament. In April, Xenophon had visited Malaysia to independently observe an anti-government protest known as the Bersih 3.0 rally and had also made his support for opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim known to the public. The article written by Roy See Wei Zhi was apparently intended to turn public opinion in the Muslim-majority country against Xenophon. Upon learning of the article, Xenophon threatened to sue the New Straits Times for defamation, this resulted in the paper removing the article from the website.\n\nLitigation\n\nThe Church of Scientology has been involved in a number of lawsuits and threatened legal action during its five decade history in Australia.\n\nA suit was brought against Kevin Victor Anderson and his assistant Gordon Just who produced the Anderson Report, in 1971. The citations in the Victorian reports are: Hubbard Association of Scientologists -v- Anderson (1971) VR 788; Hubbard Association of Scientologists v. Anderson (1972) VR 340 [appeal of 1971 VR 740]; Hubbard Association of Scientologists International v Anderson and Just (No 2) (1972) VR 577. The Victorian Parliament passed special legislation to give the two immunity from these writs.\nThe Church of Scientology requested a tax exemption from wages originating from a religious institution based on the Victoria Pay-roll Tax Act 1971. The High Court asked the question on whether Scientology was to be accepted as a religion, and decided that they were. Scientology met the two criteria that they stipulated for the determination of whether an organization is religious; first \u0022belief in a supernatural Being, Thing or Principle\u0022 and second, \u0022the acceptance of canons of conduct in order to give effect to that belief.\u0022\nThe Church of Scientology also litigated against the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, which is Australia\u0027s domestic intelligence service.",

      "description": "Seven News reported that the deceased man was from Taiwan, which is Scientology\u2019s most targeted Asian center. There is a church in the southern city of Kaohsiung and 13 missions across the island.\n\nThe sprawling, 145,000-square-foot center in the Sydney district of Chatswood offers \u201Cunbridled expansion of spiritual progress for Scientologists across Australia, New Zealand and Asia,\u201D according to its website.\n\nIt was formerly the site of the National Acoustic Laboratory and was sold to the church in 2014 for a reported $37 million, according to CNN affiliate Nine News.\n\nScientology was accorded the status of an official religion, which gives it tax exemption, in Australia in 1983.\n\n\nPosted Thu 3 Jan 2019 at 3:40amThursday 3 Jan 2019 at 3:40am, updated Thu 3 Jan 2019 at 2:03pm\nStabbings at Sydney Scientology centre leave one man dead\n\nA man who was fatally stabbed in the neck at the Church of Scientology headquarters in Sydney has been described as a \u0022beloved member\u0022 of the Church.\nA 16-year-old boy was arrested after allegedly stabbing two men, killing one, at the organisation\u0027s headquarters in Chatswood, shortly after midday.\nThe two victims were Church employees, according to police, and were taken to Royal North Shore Hospital, where one died from a wound in his neck.\nDetective Chief Inspector Simon Jones said the teen had been asked to leave the Scientology premises.\nIn a statement, the Church of Scientology said the \u0022very unfortunate matter\u0022 was now in the hands of police.\n\u0022We cannot make any further comment beyond the fact that the victim was a beloved member of our Church,\u0022 the statement said.\n\u0022The Church is providing the police with any assistance needed in their investigation.\u0022\n\nPosted Tue\n\n 23 Nov 2021 at 4:12am\nTeen found not criminally responsible over stabbing death at Scientology headquarters\n\nA court has found a teenager who stabbed a man to death at the Church of Scientology headquarters in Sydney is not criminally responsible because he was living with schizophrenia.The Taiwanese national was 16 years old when he used a knife to stab 24-year-old Chih-Jen Yeh in the neck during an altercation on the Church of Scientology driveway in Chatswood on January 3, 2019.\nHe also wounded 30-year-old security guard Shannon Vaughan during the incident.\nThe court heard that during the confrontation the boy had been demanding to see a certain Scientology staff member, screaming in Mandarin: \u0022I\u0027ll give you two minutes to find him otherwise I\u0027ll kill everyone else here.\u0022\nThe teenager had previously been found not fit to stand trial on the grounds of mental illness.\nIn a special Supreme Court hearing Justice Hament Danji found the acts the accused had been charged with were proven, but he was not criminally responsible because he would not have known what he was doing was wrong. \nThe Supreme Court heard the confrontation happened a day after the teenager\u0027s mother had deleted data from his mp3 player, because a Scientology staff member told her the boy had been reading a novel with pornographic and violent themes.\nAfter discovering the data had been deleted the boy had assaulted his mother in a classroom at the church, before being escorted home by staff members. \nThe teenager returned to the church the next day, demanding to see one of the staff members who had promised to help him restore the novel.\nCCTV images captured the boy pulling his T-shirt over the handle of a 14.6cm long knife in his pocket, before he was stopped by Mr Vaughan, an interpreter and church member Chih-Jen Yeh. \nThe court heard the footage showed the teenager swinging the knife in an overarm style at Mr Vaughan, slashing his hand as he put his arms up in self defence.\nAfter several swings he then turned the knife towards Chih-Jen Yeh, who fell to the ground  after he was sliced across his neck.\nAs Chih-Jen Yeh lay bleeding and unconscious on the driveway, the teenager again demanded to see the staff member who\u0027d promised to help him restore the data.\nThe standoff continued until police arrived and told the teenager to drop the knife. \nHe was arrested and later charged with murder and wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.\nThe court heard two psychiatrists had assessed the accused as living with schizophrenia at the time of the crime, including disturbances in his thought, mood and perception.\nBoth experts agreed that the accused lacked the capacity to know what he was doing was wrong, and the judge concurred with their advice. \nAfter handing down his verdict Justice Danji ordered that the teenager continue to be detained under the mental health act.",

This may include family, friends, loved ones, work associates, acquaintances, or anyone else found Suppressive by the Church.\nDisconnection is a very touchy topic among Scientologists and critics both. Scientologists believe that Disconnection is generally a necessary action that, when undertaken, benefits the group as a whole.

These activities are: (1) forcible confinement, (2) physical maltreatment (through such things as hard exercise, physically demanding chores, poor diet, limited time for hygiene, and inadequate sleeping arrangements, etc.); (3) social maltreatment (through restrictions in verbal and written communication with others, degradation, very low pay, etc.); (4) intensive study of ideology, and (5) forced confessions of past alleged \u2018sins.\u2019 The goal of these activities is the alignment of the RPF inmates with the ideology of Scientology as directed by its leaders. This alignment comes about after the program has eliminated people\u2019s abilities or desires to criticize policies or the leaders who oversee their implementation. Remarkably, a 1955 booklet that Hubbard himself almost certainly wrote described psychopolitical techniques of subduing people and populations to totalitarian rule, and some of the techniques foreshadow the RPF policies that subsequently he approved for use against his own elite corps...\n\nNow to the secret compound that\u2019s been labeled degrading and inhuman,\n0:04\nwith allegations of men, women and children being kept virtual prisoners,\n0:09\nworking full-time and living in appalling conditions.\n0:11\nAnd the incredible thing is, it\u2019s right in the middle of a suburban neighborhood.\n0:16\nHere\u2019s Bryan Seymour with this world exclusive report with those who have escaped\n0:21\nand are now speaking out.\n0:28\nThis is the Australian prison\u2026\n0:31\nAnd right there you\u2019re telling me, kids, adults, foreign nationals are kept there,\n0:36\nbasically held prisoners, right here in the heart of Sidney.\n0:40\nPretty much.\n0:45\nI lived in a garage for about a year and a half, maybe two years.\n0:47\nGood Day, it\u2019s Brian Seymour from Today Tonight at Channel 7 and a couple of guests\n0:52\n\u2013 thank you, that\u2019ll be great, thank you.\n0:54\nShane\u2019s story is one of shocking abuse, child abuse.

And then David Miscavige came for an interview. I immediately had the impression that I was dealing with two professional Tupperware salesmen in Weiland and B\u00FCchele, who are quite whimsical.\n\nReichelt: What particularly interests me is that Klaus B\u00FCchele, Kurt Weiland\u2019s deputy, recently told me that he got such a scolding and so much trouble from him for organizing your interview with Miscavige and the result after publication that you can\u2019t imagine. He got into a lot of trouble, shortly before the RPF. Yes, because the interview didn\u2019t go as Miscavige, B\u00FCchele and Miscavige had imagined and promised. It went out of the Scientology control.\n\nLotter: Do you know the background to this scoop?\n\nReichelt: No, I don\u2019t.\n\nLotter: In 1994, I did a big investigative story about Scientology for the news magazine PROFIL in Vienna. And then Scientology threatened to sue me and PROFIL and we had a conversation with a lawyer in Vienna who represented Scientology against me. The whole thing was very unpleasant for him. But he represented Scientology anyway. He probably needed the money. But I don\u2019t think he really had anything to do with them, as far as I could see. But he signaled to me that there was a way to avoid a costly lawsuit against me by Scientology. I would have the opportunity to interview sect boss Miscavige in Los Angeles for PROFIL, on the condition that we agree in advance which questions may be put to him. Then things would work out.\n\nReichelt: And this young lawyer told you, watch out, we, Scientology, are giving you the unique opportunity to interview the boss, the big boss of the organization.\n\nLotter: Exactly, it was obvious that this lawyer in Vienna had already been instructed by the two leading Austrian Scientology agents Weiland and B\u00FCchele. As Austrians, both knew the then leading investigative news magazine PROFIL. And that certainly played a role. That was my impression. I had the same feeling when I first met them in Los Angeles. \u201CLet\u2019s take a closer look at the little guy and impress him first. We\u2019ll show him our great \u201CCelebrity Center\u201D. And show him, person to person, that we\u2019re only human.\u201D The two of them are very likeable salespeople for a special cause.\n\nReichelt: And it was always just B\u00FCchele and Weiland with you?\n\nLotter: Yes, exactly. Those were the two of them. They were the leading acts. And then we went to the HGB building around the corner from the Celebrity Centre in Hollywood. I had someone else with me as my \u201Cbuddy\u201D so that someone could confirm everything that was going to happen. There were also two tapes playing.\n\nReichelt: Where did the conversation with Miscavige take place? In the HGB building on the 11th floor?\n\nLotter: Yes, on the 11th floor, in the large conference room at Miscavige office. PROFIL had also hired a photographer from Los Angeles to take photos of this interview. The photos of Miscavige that were later published in PROFIL were shot by this photographer upstairs on the 11th Miscavige floor. The interview lasted almost an hour. B\u00FCchele and Weiland were also there.\n\nReichelt: What happened after the article was published? Was there any reaction from Scientology?\n\nLotter: Shortly after publication, I received a \u201Cfire letter\u201D in Vienna. From the sender: David Miscavige. With a golden letterhead, with his name on it. Written in blue. With very nasty content, full of insults against me from him. What a bad journalist and liar I am. It was very disappointing, the tirades of abuse Miscavige launched against me. Unbelievable, even today. The fact that Scientology got involved in this still amazes me today.",

It states that it is an \u0022international membership organization whose members use both L. Ron Hubbard management technology and embrace the responsibilities and ethical standards of WISE membership.\u0022\n\nMembership in WISE means that the owner(s) of the firm have embraced Hubbard\u0027s administrative ideas such as management by statistics and the Org board and have agreed to abide by a certain Code of Ethics which includes arbitration by a WISE mediator of any disputes with another WISE member.[1] That is the basic company membership. If the firm also wants to train its employees in the Hubbard administrative technology using WISE materials then they become a higher-level member by paying a pre-determined amount of money to WISE.[4] Some employees and prospective employees have objected to this formal training in that it is something that is also a part of Scientology and a number have filed discrimination lawsuits with mixed results.\n\nWISE headquarters are located in Los Angeles, California, 6331 Hollywood Blvd, in the Hollywood Guaranty Building. The corporate executives of WISE belong to the Sea Org of the Church of Scientology.\nHubbard College of Administration International, which provides a \u0022Degree program for an Associate of Applied Science Degree of Management and Administration\u0022, is located at 320 North Vermont Avenue, Los Angeles, California.\nWISE regional offices, which are at Church of Scientology locations, coordinate the local level Charter Committees.\nCharter Committees of established members in local areas provide guidance and dispute mediation between WISE members instead of using the civil courts.\nHubbard Management Consultants are WISE members licensed to sell services, seminars, training and courses based on Admin Tech and to encourage their clients to become WISE members. Consultants are encouraged to compete in the \u0022WISE Consultant Expansion Game\u0022 with weekly standings.[3] WISE consultants include \u0022MasterTech Computer Products\u0022, Sterling Management Systems, Survival Strategies Inc., Management Success and David Singer Enterprises.\n\nBayerisches Landesamt f\u00FCr Verfassungsschutz:\nScientology Organisationsstruktur und Tarnorganisationen:\nDie Scientology Organisation (SO) ist wie ein internationaler Wirtschaftskonzern organisiert und strukturiert.

As Hubbard reported in his \u0022management technology\u0022 dictionary:\n[t]he first RPF\u0027s RPF assignment was made because the person considered their [sic] RPF assignment amusing, an award [sic] and was therefore unable to recognize a need for redemption or any means to effect it. Until such time as the person recognized this need and of their [sic] own self- determinism requested to be included in the RPF redemption actions, the [RPF\u0027s RPF] restrictions applied\u0022 (Hubbard, 1975: 451 [emphasis in original]).\n\nPeople on the RPF\u0027s RPF were segregated from the RPF inmates in their work assignments, eating, sleeping, roll-call, and other activities. They were not paid, did not receive auditing, were not to receive more than six hours sleep, and received triple ethics penalties for offenses. Reflecting the fact that the RPF\u0027s RPF began on a ship, inmates in the program were allowed to work only \u0022on mud boxes in the E/R [engine room].\u0022 Moreover, they were allowed to communicate only with the person in charge of the RPF, and could \u0022not join RPF fully until acceptable amends [were] made to all RPF members\u0022 (Hubbard, 1975: 451 [emphasis in original]).\n\nThe long sought Scientology cult \u0022Flag Order 3434RB\u0022, \u0022Rehabilitation Project Force\u0022, 7 January 1974.\nBackground: Brainwashing in Scientology\u0027s Rehabilitation Project Force (RPF) (University of Alberta)\nTHE REHABILITATION PROJECT FORCE\nExcerpts:\nUNIFORMS\nThe RPF members wear BLACK boilersuit, or ethnically acceptable cleaning outfit in very dark blue.\n2.

      "description": "Great German TV Doc \u0022Scientology - The Trail of Mysterious Deaths\u0022 in Clearwater - 2019\nScientology - Auf der Spur mysteri\u00F6ser Todesf\u00E4lle\n\n18. January 2019 - \u0022Every day I think: This is a day my son won\u0027t experience.\u0022 US-American Victoria Britton fights back tears as she says this. Her 21-year-old son Kyle Brennan died of a gunshot wound in his father\u0027s apartment in Clearwater, Florida, on the evening of February 19, 2007. The exact circumstances of his death have still not been clarified. There are allegations that the Scientology psychology group is involved in the case. However, this has never been proven.\n\nThe Kyle Brennan case is just one of many cases linked to Clearwater, the capital of Scientology. In a documentary, ZDFinfo follows the trail of three mysterious deaths in the environment of the globally active psycho group. Clearwater, which is considered the Mecca of Scientologists, also plays a role in the unexplained death of veterinarian Biggi Reichert from Bavaria. She finds herself in what she sees as a hopeless situation when she comes to Florida in 2006 and seeks help at the Scientologists\u0027 headquarters. Shortly after her return to Germany, the 40-year-old\u0027s body is found in a car in Hamburg.\n\nMysterious deaths\n\nThe Hamburg criminal investigation department initially assumes that the vet committed suicide. During the autopsy, forensic experts discovered 28 injuries to the head that looked like burns. The Hamburg criminal investigation department then pressed charges against unknown persons for intentional bodily harm. Mysterious evidence points to a possible connection with Scientology. After two years, the case file is closed.\n\nAnother death in the Mecca of Scientology at the beginning of 2014. Russian businessman Yevgeny Zharkin falls from the eighth floor of a tall building in Clearwater. The investigation into the case of Yevgeny Zharkin has now also been closed. Yevgeny allegedly committed suicide. \u0022But we don\u0027t believe that,\u0022 says his mother Alle Zharkina. \u0022Yevgeny was not a weakling. He wouldn\u0027t have ended his life like that. I have a hunch that he wasn\u0027t alone in the room the last time we spoke on Skype. Someone was controlling him.\u0022\nWhy did these people have to die? What role does Scientology play in the deaths? And why do both US and German authorities often suddenly stop their investigations? \nIn search of answers to puzzling questions.\nAuf der Suche nach Antworten auf r\u00E4tselhafte Fragen.\n\n18. Jan 2019 - ZDF TV begibt sich in einer Dokumentation auf die Spur von drei mysteri\u00F6sen Todesf\u00E4llen im Umfeld des weltweit aktiven Psychokonzerns Scientology.\n \n\u0022Jeden Tag denke ich: Das ist ein Tag, den mein Sohn nicht erlebt.\u0022 Die US-Amerikanerin Victoria Britton k\u00E4mpft mit den Tr\u00E4nen, als sie dies sagt. Ihr 21-j\u00E4hriger Sohn Kyle Brennan stirbt am Abend des 19. Februar 2007 an einer Schussverletzung in der Wohnung des Vaters in Clearwater im US-Bundesstaat Florida. Die genauen Todesumst\u00E4nde sind bis heute nicht gekl\u00E4rt. Es steht der Vorwurf im Raum, dass der Psychokonzern Scientology in den Fall verwickelt ist. Nachgewiesen wurde dies allerdings nie.\n\nDer Fall Kyle Brennan ist nur einer von vielen F\u00E4llen, die mit Clearwater, der Hauptstadt der Scientologen, in Verbindung stehen. ZDFinfo begibt sich in einer TV-Dok. auf die Spur von drei mysteri\u00F6sen Todesf\u00E4llen im Umfeld des weltweit aktiven Psychokonzerns. Clearwater, das als Mekka der Scientologen gilt, spielt auch eine Rolle im ungekl\u00E4rten Todesfall der Tier\u00E4rztin Biggi Reichert aus Bayern. Sie befindet sich in einer in ihren Augen ausweglosen Situation, als sie 2006 nach Florida kommt und Hilfe in der Zentrale der Scientologen sucht. Kurz nach ihrer R\u00FCckkehr nach Deutschland wird die Leiche der 40-J\u00E4hrigen in einem Auto in Hamburg gefunden.\nR\u00E4tselhafte Todesf\u00E4lle\n\nDie Hamburger Kriminalpolizei geht zun\u00E4chst von einem Freitod der Tier\u00E4rztin aus. Bei der Obduktion entdecken die Rechtsmediziner 28 Verletzungen am Kopf, die wie Brandwunden aussehen. Daraufhin stellt die Hamburger Kripo Anzeige gegen Unbekannt wegen vors\u00E4tzlicher K\u00F6rperverletzung. Mysteri\u00F6se Indizien weisen auf einen m\u00F6glichen Zusammenhang mit Scientology hin. Nach zwei Jahren wird die Akte des Falls geschlossen.\n\nAnfang 2014. Ein weiterer Todesfall im Mekka der Scientologen. Der russische Gesch\u00E4ftsmann Jewgeni Zharkin f\u00E4llt aus dem achten Stock eines hohen Geb\u00E4udes in Clearwater. Die Ermittlungen im Fall von Jewgeni Zharkin sind mittlerweile ebenfalls eingestellt. Angeblich beging Jewgeni Selbstmord. \u0022Aber wir glauben das nicht,\u0022 sagt seine Mutter Alle Zharkina. \u0022Jewgeni war kein Schw\u00E4chling. Er h\u00E4tte sein Leben nicht so beendet. Ich habe die Vermutung, dass er nicht allein im Zimmer war, als wir das letzte Mal \u00FCber Skype sprachen. Jemand hat ihn kontrolliert.\u0022\nWeshalb mussten diese Menschen sterben? Welche Rolle spielt Scientology bei den Todesf\u00E4llen? Und warum stellen sowohl US-amerikanische als auch deutsche Beh\u00F6rden h\u00E4ufig ganz pl\u00F6tzlich ihre Ermittlungen ein?",

Die Produzenten sind Nico Hofmann und Benjamin Benedict.\nEntstehung\nDer Film kostete 2,5 Millionen Euro.[2] Er ist das erste Projekt eines deutschen Fernsehsenders, in dem das umstrittene Thema Scientology zu einem fiktionalen Stoff verarbeitet wird.[3] Aus Sorge vor rechtlichen Schritten seitens der Scientology-Kirche wurde der Film unter dem Decknamen Tatort: \u201EDer Tote im Sund\u201C gedreht.[4] Nach dem Bekanntwerden reagierte Scientology mit einer Pressekonferenz sowie einem eigenen Gegenfilm.[2] Das Erste nahm die Wiederholung des Films am Tag nach der Premiere aus dem Programm, da der Film aus Gr\u00FCnden des Jugendschutzes nicht vormittags ausgestrahlt werden durfte.[5]\nSWR-Fernsehfilmchef Carl Bergengruen erkl\u00E4rte bei der Berliner Filmpremiere, zum heiklen Thema Scientology bewusst einen Spielfilm produziert zu haben, da so mehr Menschen erreicht werden k\u00F6nnten als mit einer Dokumentation.[6]\nHandlung\nDer fiktionale Film zeigt, wie eine Familie mit Scientology in Ber\u00FChrung kommt und schlie\u00DFlich ihr gesamtes Leben davon beeinflusst wird.[7][8] Als der Protagonist Frank Reiners die Scientology-Kirche verlassen will, entbrennt zwischen ihm und seiner Frau, die weiterhin Scientology-Mitglied bleibt, ein Streit um das Sorgerecht f\u00FCr das gemeinsame Kind. Der Film spielt als R\u00FCckblende aus dem Gerichtssaal.\n\nRezeption\nDie Erstausstrahlung des Films am 31. M\u00E4rz 2010 um 20:15 Uhr[9][10] sahen 8,69 Millionen Zuschauer (Marktanteil: 27,1 %), doppelt so viele wie \u00FCblicherweise bei anderen Mittwochsfilmen im Ersten. Bei der Gruppe der 14- bis 49-J\u00E4hrigen konnten 2,20 Millionen Zuschauer und 17,3 % Marktanteil erreicht werden.[11]\nScientology bezeichnete die Produktion als \u201Eabsoluten Propagandafilm\u201C.[12]\nDie im Anschluss an den Film ausgestrahlte Talksendung \u201EHart aber fair\u201C zum Thema Scientology erzielte ebenfalls eine vergleichsweise hohe Quote: 7,47 Millionen Zuschauer sorgten f\u00FCr einen Marktanteil von 28,3 %, dies war die h\u00F6chste je erzielte Reichweite der Sendung.[11] In ihr nahm der Pressesprecher der Organisation Stellung zu dem Film.[13][14] Bei der \u00FCblichen Webausstrahlung der Talkshow war es der Redaktion aus rechtlichen Gr\u00FCnden nicht mehr m\u00F6glich, dokumentierende Einspieler zu Vorgehensweisen der Organisation anzubieten. Sie wurden mit einem Hinweis auf die Rechtslage ausgeblendet.\nAuch im Deutschlandfunk war der Film am Tag der Ausstrahlung Schwerpunktthema.[15] Es gab Interviews mit dem Filmemacher Niki Stein[16] sowie mit dem Berliner Journalisten Frank Nordhausen[17] und der Hamburger Scientology-Expertin Ursula Caberta.[18]\nAm 29. Februar 2012 wurde der Film erneut um 20:15 im ersten Programm der ARD und am 31.

      "description": "\u0022Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief\u0022 is a fantastic 2015 HBO doc about Scientology and its crimes. \nA devastating two hour documentary based on Lawrence Wright\u0027s book of the same name. Scientology is laid bare by a film that skilfully knits together archive footage, testimonials from former high ranking officials and public, and dramatic reconstructions.\n\nFilm adaptation\nMain article: Going Clear (film)\nGoing Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief is a 2013 non-fiction book about Scientology written by Lawrence Wright.\n\nThe book was adapted into a documentary film by HBO, directed by Alex Gibney, and premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 25, 2015. It had been stated by HBO documentary films chief Sheila Nevins that HBO had 160 lawyers review the film out of concerns about litigation by the Church of Scientology.[18] This was later called hyperbole by Gibney, though the film was scrutinized by HBO\u0027s lawyers.[19]\n\nGoing Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief is a 2013 non-fiction book about Scientology written by Lawrence Wright.\nThe book contains interviews with current and former Scientologists, the histories of founder L. Ron Hubbard and current leader David Miscavige, and analysis of the relationships of Tom Cruise and John Travolta to the organization. In an interview with The New York Times Wright said that \u0022There are a lot of people out there who were very high up in the church and know a lot about it who have become outspoken... I\u0027m very lucky to come along at a time when a lot of these people are ready to talk\u0022.[1] Wright also disclosed that he had received \u0022innumerable\u0022 letters threatening legal action from lawyers representing Scientology and celebrities who belong to it.[1] Wright spoke to two hundred current and former Scientologists for the book.[1]\nThe title of the book, Going Clear, is in reference to a stage of spiritual development in Scientology. In Scientology parlance, \u0022Clear\u0022 means a state of having freed oneself from \u0022subconscious memories of past trauma\u0022. Scientologists go through therapy sessions called \u0022auditing\u0022 as part of the process of becoming Clear.[2]\n\nClark Collis reviewed the book for Entertainment Weekly, writing:\nLawrence Wright, who won a Pulitzer for 2006\u0027s The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11, interviewed roughly 200 current and former Scientologists for the book, which began as a 2011 New Yorker article written with Haggis\u0027 cooperation. You can feel the heft of the research as he details Hubbard\u0027s establishment of the church in the \u002750s, its globe-spanning infiltration of government agencies in the \u002770s, and the more recent alleged physical abuse suffered by some members (the Church of Scientology denies many of the claims...) Going Clear is peppered with examples of the church lavishly accommodating its A-list members, particularly Tom Cruise, if not always dealing so well with its famous congregants\u0027 quips.[6]",

(0:12) He is a well-known member of the Scientology Church, but this man here now claims Tom Cruise is actually a victim of Scientology and its leader Dave Miscavige. (0:24) For two decades, he was the right hand of the Scientology bosses until he could no longer and fled.\n(0:30) An exit that he almost had to pay with his life.\n(0:36) His life is now so completely different, as he never planned it. (0:41) And it\u0027s a person\u0027s fault. (0:44) This is the last letter I got in 2018 from Dave Miscavige.\n(0:50) It is the absolute proof that Dave Miscavige considered me as a friend. (0:54) When I looked at this letter, it became clear to me that this is not a friendship, but another form of manipulation. (1:01) He brings people into a privileged position and then executes them.\n(1:07) This also happened with Mitch Brisker, he tells us, and it would have almost led to a suicide. (1:15) Los Angeles, Friday afternoon. (1:17) We have an appointment with the man who has left the inner circle of the Scientology sect.\n(1:25) Hello, my name is Mitch Brisker. (1:28) I was at Scientology for 50 years. (1:30) 30 of them I was the creative director of the global propaganda machinery of Scientology.\n(1:36) I left a couple of years ago. (1:38) I wrote a book with the title Scientology, the big lie, how I made an evil cult look good. (1:45) And now he wants to tell everything in front of our camera, what really happens behind the closed doors of the controversial sect.\n(1:51) It is his first interview on German television. (1:55) As a young filmmaker, Mitch Brisker joins Scientology.\n(2:04) Producing high-quality training videos. (2:10) They had fought until 1990 when I came there to make films that they could even show in public without being ashamed. (2:19) Then when Tom Cruise became Scientologist, it became an even bigger problem, because how could you show this old, terrible film to the biggest film star in the world?\n(2:30) The fact that I was able to make them at a very high quality was a big deal. (2:38) Miscavige often said, did Mitch see that? (2:41) He wanted me to advise him in all life situations.\n(2:46) So I was in a very privileged position. (2:53) Mitch Brisker is now responsible for all Scientology films. (2:58) Here are excerpts from various training videos of the cult, which he made and made available to us.\n(3:04) The 74-year-old today becomes a kind of right hand of David Miscavige. (3:08) There is a lot of talk about us and we understand that. (3:13) People are curious.\n(3:15) He describes the mighty cult leader today as follows. (3:19) He lives like a super celebrity. (3:22) He flies in private jets.\n(3:25) He eats in the best restaurants. (3:27) At our last meeting he wore these cufflinks. (3:31) I thought to myself, wow, these are exaggerated.\n(3:34) They were platinum, diamonds and Scientology logos. (3:41) They probably cost thousands of dollars. (3:43) And parishioners tear their backs.\n(3:47) They lose their homes. (3:48) They tear out their credit cards. (3:51) Or they are super rich, who get the feeling through their donations that they are connected to something that makes the world a better place.\n(4:02) But the world is still the same. (4:05) And the empty Scientologies act like a show, a facade, for which David Miscavige is richly gifted and hard to pay. (4:12) Two kinds of measures, says Mitch Brisker.\n(4:14) And he has to know it, because for decades he has been one of the closest confidants of Scientology. (4:21) He also knows the most intimate secrets, probably from and about Tom Cruise. (4:26) He is the most important member of the cult.\n(4:28) Or as the 74-year-old said ... (4:31) Tom Cruise is not the first victim of Scientology, but he is the most prominent victim. (4:38) Because how else could the leader of this religion sabotage so much in his life, in terms of all his marriages, the only biological offspring, the adoptive children.\n(4:49) And that is a form of abuse. (4:52) That does not mean that Tom Cruise does not also act abusively. (4:56) He has watched a lot of David Miscavige.\n(4:59) They mirror each other. (5:02) After all these experiences and his own dissonances, Mitch Brisker decides to leave Scientology in 2022. (5:09) And even to write a book.\n(5:11) Not an easy time for the filmmaker. (5:13) He is dropped by Scientology and even mentally finished. (5:18) It was rough because I wanted to kill myself.\n(5:21) It was rough because I was literally at risk of suicide. (5:24) Why? (5:25) Because by the end of 60 I was out of my business.\n(5:29) I have dedicated all my talents and my whole career for three decades to this organization, which now has less value for me. (5:38) And then, when I suddenly needed help and turned to them, because I was not satisfied with my behavior either, I was punished for it. (5:48) They even demand money after his exit.",

      "description": "Munich/Germany February 1998 - Germany OSA long-term Executive Director Sabine Weber in a legendary dialogue with Garry Scarff in front of the Scientology headquarter, around Garry a bunch of OSA agents fearing him...\n\nfootage by Peter Reichelt - first time ever aired today live\n\nOne day later the newspaper story about Garry Scarff with \u0022Mannheimer Morgen\u0022.\nFormer Scientology OSA agent Garry Scarff flew to Germany in February 1998 to protest against Scientology and OSA all by himself in front of the German Scientology headquarters in Munich. It was the first ever protest of its kind in Europe.\n\nShortly afterwards, on February 20, 1998, the following article appeared in a major German daily newspaper:\n\nGarry Scarff did not want to become a murderer\n\nFebruary 20, 1998 - \u0022Mannheimer Morgen\u0022 - German daily newspaper\nBy our editorial staff member Stephan T\u00F6ngi\n\nThe story sounds like something out of a crime novel, even if Garry Scarff\u0027s account is unemotional. The man has far more to tell than he wants to say in order not to incriminate himself. After all, according to his own statement, the American was a member of the Scientolo-gy sect from 1978 to 1991, the last six years in their \u0022Office of Special Affairs\u0022. He only drew the line when it came to murder.\n\nIn an interview with our newspaper, the high-ranking drop-out describes the department, abbreviated to OSA, as the \u0022Gestapo of Scientology\u0022. For him, the controversial association is \u0022criminal\u0022 - an esteem that, conversely, Scientology holds for people like him: \u0022Dropouts are considered \u0027suppressive persons,\u0022 Scarff introduces the thinking of the internationally active organization. \u0022If they criticize Scientology publicly, they are classified as \u0027criminals\u0027. And if, like me, they belonged to the leadership of the secret service, they are \u0027highly criminal\u0027.\u0022\n\nLet\u0027s flash back to 1985: Garry Scarff, born in 1956, had been a Scientology member for seven years.\n\nThe young man was therefore someone Scientology could rely on. \n\nHis first assignment, says the 41-year-old, took him all over the States: \u0022I had to steal critical books about Scientology from all kinds of libraries and replace them with Dianetics writings.\u0022 Whatever he couldn\u0027t smuggle out fell victim to the razor blade. Things soon became less harmless: He was set to destroy the largest aid organization for cult victims at the time called \u0022Can\u0022 (Cult awareness network). \u0022It was then what Germany is to Scientology today - the main enemy,\u0022 explains Scarff and recalls: \u0022First he maligned Can in letters to members of Congress, then he snuck in and stole personal files. \u0022We put so much pressure on a man who had abused his daughter that he testified against \u0027Can\u0027.\u0022 However, the double agent was discovered. \n\nUntil November 1991, Scarff admits today that he did not shy away from violence. For example, when ex-Scientologists demanded part of their course fees back: \u0022As a warning, I was supposed to set fire to a man\u0027s car. I poured so much gasoline on it that the whole garage burned down. \u0022Another time, he claims to have beaten up and strangled a woman so that she couldn\u0027t scream. This order was given to him by the current No. 2 in Scientology, Mike Rinder. Scarff: \u0022When I returned from such actions, people laughed, clapped and celebrated.\u0022\n\nSo now the \u0022special assignment\u0022 was issued that would have made the OSA man almost immortal \u0022for special affairs\u0022.\n\u0022You will be a hero of Scientology\u0022, he was promised at the very top. Scarff claims that he was supposed to commit two murders: of Cynthia Kisser, the director of \u0022Can\u0022, and Ford Green, a lawyer who took care of many cult victims at \u0022Can\u0022. According to Scarff\u0027s account, he was supposed to cut the brake cables on Kisser\u0027s car; and Green, who was known as a fast driver, was supposed to be killed on the Golden Gate Bridge in Los Angeles. Scientology still deals with its \u0022enemies\u0022 today as Hubbard had specified: Opponents may be \u0022sued, lied to or destroyed\u201C.\n\nHowever, Scarff took flight and spent 17 days in court giving evidence under oath. Nevertheless, he was unable to harm Scientology. Since then, he has been under constant surveillance, once they tried to kidnap him, another time they threatened him and his parents with murder. Finally, in 1997, he made a written agreement with Scientology to remain silent with immediate effect if he was allowed to see his mother - a practicing Scientologist - again in return. \u0022I stuck to it for a long time, but Scientology did nothing,\u0022 says Scarff. That\u0027s why he no longer feels bound.\n\nHe has no fear of revenge: \u0022If they want to kill me, there\u0027s nothing I can do about it anyway,\u0022 says Scarff with a shrug. Emotions only arise when he thinks about what he has done to others: \u0022I regret destroying the lives of others.\u0022 And he regrets that his life was also damaged.\u0022",

That\u0027s what prompted him to leave, says Scarf.\n\n[Speaker 1]\n\nIt was the worst thing I could ever be asked to do, which was to extinguish another human being\u0027s life. It is monstrous to see an opponent of the cult as an enemy of the magnitude that I was ordered to do. It was an order, not a request.\n\nI was pressured to carry out this murder. The plan was for her to lose control of her vehicle after the brake cables were cut. If that didn\u0027t work, I was supposed to ram her car from behind to cause an accident.\n\nI should do everything I can to make sure she\u0027s dead. If she did survive the accident, I was tasked with suffocating her with a pillow.\n\n[Speaker 2]\n\nScarf also testified under oath to these outrageous accusations, which Scientology denies.\n\n[Speaker 1]\n\nWhen we talked about the murder of the cult opponent, the atmosphere was very relaxed. There was a lot of laughter. The whole thing seemed like great fun.\n\nIt was a feeling of power. Power that we would have over that individual. And then we talked about what to do if the investigative authorities reacted so quickly that I could no longer escape.\n\nIn this case I should TKO. TKO, total knock out, i.e. suicide. And I was shown exactly how to do it.\n\nOne took his finger as if it were a revolver and pushed it into his mouth. He had to point it upwards so that the bullet would penetrate the brain stem. And then he told me that if you don\u0027t die right away, then at least your brain will be destroyed and you won\u0027t be able to talk and you\u0027ll just be a lifeless shell.\n\n[Speaker 2]\n\nScientology denies this too.

Rinder accuses Gary of publicly lying years earlier while working for an anti-cult organization.\n\nYes, says Gary, everything I did on behalf of OSA was a lie.\n\n\n\n\n\u0022Karin Spaink\nI write, therefore I am\nScientology is caught in the Net\n\nACTUALLY, THE TESTIMONY of Scientology-member Gerry Scarff is much more horrifying. Scarf was questioned under oath in 1993, and elaborated on the behaviour of Scientology\u2019s lawyers (of the Bowles \u0026 Moxon-firm, who are of course members of the cult too).\n\nThe complete declaration covers hundreds of pages that make your flesh creep. For the sake of good taste, I\u2019ll just quote the summary that the defendant\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Berry, gave to the court: \u201CIn his deposition, Mr. Scarff testified about various criminal and wrongful activities directed by or discussed in the presence of attorney\u2019s from the law offices of Bowles \u0026 Moxon, including: death threats, Scientology\u2019s Fair Game doctrine, plans to kill Cult Awareness Network president Cynthia Kisser and attorney Ford Greene, threats against witnesses, instructions to commit suicide, misdirecting and misleading investigations and prosecutions of Scientology, the filing of frivolous lawsuits, financial scams, lies and fraud by Scientology and similar activities.\u201D\u0022\n\n\n\nGarry Scarff has said that he used to be an OSA operative. He has made a number of statements about the inner workings of OSA, many of which are disputed by the Church. In a sworn deposition taken between July and August 1993 and submitted in Church of Scientology International vs. Steven Fishman and Uwe Geertz, Scarff testified, \u0022...I was directed, one, to go to Chicago, Illinois and to murder Cynthia Kisser, Cynthia Kisser being the Executive Director of the Cult Awareness Network, by a staged car accident.\u0022 The murder of Kisser did not take place and Scarff said, \u0022I could not bring myself to harm or kill anybody.\u0022 Scientology attorney Kendrick Moxon has called Scarff \u0022a liar\u0022 and Moxon also stated that \u0022Scarff\u0027s own father says he\u0027s a scumbag.\u0022 Scarff has also been said to \u0022flip-flop\u0022 by a representative of the former Cult Awareness Network.",

Bayerns Innenminister Joachim Herrmann und Dr. Burkhard K\u00F6rner, Pr\u00E4sident des Bayerischen Landesamts f\u00FCr Verfassungsschutz (LfV), haben heute die Neuauflage der Brosch\u00FCre \u201EDas System Scientology\u201C und den Kurzfilm \u002210 Tipps wie du dich nicht verarschen l\u00E4sst \u2013 diesmal von Scientologen\u201C vorgestellt.\n\nDie vielf\u00E4ltigen Aktivit\u00E4ten der Scientology (SO) sind eine nicht zu untersch\u00E4tzende Gefahr f\u00FCr den Einzelnen als auch f\u00FCr die Gemeinschaft. \u201EDie lautlose Gefahr, die von Scientology ausgeht, ger\u00E4t angesichts anderer gravierender Bedrohungen leicht in Vergessenheit. Umso wichtiger ist es, dass mit diesen beiden Formaten die Aufkl\u00E4rung der \u00D6ffentlichkeit weiter verst\u00E4rkt wird\u201C sagte Herrmann.\n\nScientology versucht \u00FCber jeden ihrer Anh\u00E4nger die totalit\u00E4re Kontrolle zu gewinnen, sie strebt im Innern als auch im \u00C4u\u00DFern eine nach ihren Regeln funktionierende Gesellschaft an. Das Landesamt f\u00FCr Verfassungsschutz stellt hierzu vermehrt \u201EMarketing\u201C-Aktivit\u00E4ten fest, um gezielt unterschiedliche Personengruppen anzusprechen. Hierbei nutzt Scientology auch Verunsicherungen aufgrund der Corona-Pandemie, um Menschen in schwierigen pers\u00F6nlichen Lagen zu gewinnen. \u201EDiesem ausgekl\u00FCgelten System aus psychologischer Manipulation muss entschieden entgegengetreten werden,\u201C betonte der Minister. \u201EDurch die sehr erfolgreiche Aufkl\u00E4rungsarbeit des Landesamtes f\u00FCr Verfassungsschutz konnte in den letzten Jahren einem Anstieg der Mitgliederzahlen in Bayern konsequent entgegengewirkt werden. Mit den beiden Formaten wird diese Aufkl\u00E4rung der \u00D6ffentlichkeit nochmals verst\u00E4rkt.\u201C\n\nSeit \u00FCber 20 Jahren kl\u00E4rt die Brosch\u00FCre \u201EDas System Scientology\u201C die \u00D6ffent\u00ADlich\u00ADkeit erfolgreich \u00FCber die SO auf. Sie z\u00E4hlt mit einer Gesamtauflage von bis\u00ADlang mehr als 70.000 zu den gefrag\u00ADtesten Informationsbrosch\u00FCren des Ver\u00ADfassungs\u00ADschutzes in Bayern.

Ranch\u0022 or \u0022Castile Canyon School\u0022. This property was also the location of the \u0022Int RPF\u0022 where Scientology International Management staff were sent for thought reconditioning. \n\nPeter Reichelt and his crew were searching for a German citizen, Wiebke Hansen (formerly the Executive Director of The Church of Scientology of Hamburg) who had fallen out of favor with David Miscavige and was forced into the Rehabilitation Project Force despite the fact she was not a Sea Org Member (totally unheard of). \n\nI was there and I am sad to say that I was not on the right side of history. \n\nThe full video of the 1998 interaction with the Peter Reichelt and Ina Brockmann at the Int Ranch Property can be found using the link below:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVzArpXgXnM\u0026t=1234s\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFm0cFJJkdI\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w68aZ_41hds\u0026t=2220s\n\nBruce Hines, former RPF inmate and the Auditor of Wiebke Hansen at the RPF and of the painter Gottfried Helnwein in Clearwater/Florida:\nYou are correct, Wiebke Hansen was in the Sea Org, and likely still is. But the odd thing was that she joined the Sea Org in order to do the RPF program. A high-ranking Sea Org member went to Hamburg to get Wiebke and then travel with her to Happy Valley. She was not in the Sea Org at that time. She joined while at Happy Valley. I spent hours per day for two years with Wiebke, so it would be impossible for me to tell you what she told me. I got to know her very well. She was my \u0022RPF twin.\u0022 I audited her and she audited me.",

      "description": "Scientology celebrity Michael Pattinson describes how he became OT VIII on the ship \u0022Freewinds\u0022.\nMichael Pattinson\n\nInterviewed in March 1998 by German TV - journalist Peter Reichelt in L.A.\n\nhttp://www.xenu-directory.net/critics/pattinsonm1.htmlBeverly Hills, Ca 90211\n\nMichael Pattinson declaration:\n20 September 1997\n\nTO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN\n\nI strongly feel that it is my civic duty to bring to the attention of the competent authorities of the United States and other concerned countries a matter of severe abuses and destructive activities by the \u0022Church\u0022 of Scientology. I am at their disposition for more information on all of this.\n\nI was shocked at the use of top celebrities by Scientology to try and give an impression of it which, per my own experiences, is a false impression. When I compare the ridiculous charges made by Scientology against the German government with what I know Scientology (underlined) has been doing itself I find a very strong similarity indeed. I have decided to speak out about this publicly.\n\nI was, until earlier this year, one of Scientology\u0027s \u0022celebrities\u0022. I am a professional artist, having a 25 year career internationally with over 99% sales. I was in Scientology for 23 years, did very many courses, and reached the highest available level of \u0022New O.T.7\u0022 My knowledge of the inner workings of Scientology is extensive. I have information about the many instances of abuses of current and former Scientology members and of lies Scientology has generated about itself to give a wrong public impression.\n\nAmong the many things I can relate, here are just a few from recent times:\n\n1) From 1991 to 1996 I was the subject of vicious machinations by several \u0022churches\u0022 of Scientology to destroy my name and repute, and to involve me in expensive \u0022justice handlings\u0022 within the organization. Apart from the horrific emotional stress over five years it cost me well over $120,000 to clear my name of accusations of things I had never done in the first place! I have full documentation of all these multiple abuses.\n\n2) In June of 1996 I was held against my will in the Scientology, Clearwater, Florida facility and \u0022ordered\u0022 to pay $7,400 before they would let me out of the room. I did not want to pay for what the two staff members insisted I must have, and what ensued was a verbal battle, emotional trauma and an attempt at financial extortion. After a time I managed to escape the physical detention, but two \u0022Sea Org\u0022 members chased me right out into the streets of Clearwater to try to recapture me. I did not pay the money. This incident is on file with the Clearwater Police Department.\n\n3) In June of 1991 I was forced to pay, despite vehement protestations, the sum of $7,400 to Scientology on the \u0022Freewinds\u0022 ship. The ruse used on that Wednesday was that if I did not pay then they would withhold my passport from me until I did pay. They did so and I had to pay the money to get it back.\n\n4) At the end of 1996 I was subjected to [a] horrible kind of \u0022religious deprogramming\u0022 in the Scientology \u0022Fort Harrission Hotel\u0022. This was done, using an \u0022E-meter\u0022, by a top official of the \u0022Religious technology Centre\u0022 (RTC) namely Mr Marty Rathbun. I was interrogated for several hours on the most intimate personal religious beliefs (Christian) and his actions were designed clearly to get me to give up my Christian religious beliefs in exchange for RTC\u0027s \u0022eligibility authorization\u0022 to read a confidential publication about a defective \u0022OT level\u0022 I had previously completed (OT 7). His utter contempt for my religious beliefs were all to apparent. He felt that all other religions apart from Scientology should be destroyed and probably would be in time by Scientology, using RTC\u0027s programs of \u0022eligibility\u0027s\u0022 as the means of forcing people to give up other faiths.\n\nI also had to undergo many hours of \u0022false data removal\u0022 to try to \u0022get me to realize\u0022 that the ONLY valid religion was Scientology.\n\nIt did not work.\n\nMy considered, personal opinion is that Scientology is definitely NOT A RELIGION.\n\nThese are a few of the many things I can testify to.\n\nI declare under penalty of perjury under California Laws that the above is true and correct per my own personal experiences.\n\n20 September 1997 Sea Beach California\n\n_________________________\n\nsigned - Michael P Pattinson",

      "description": "Incredible - John Travolta-The Worst Actor For Scientology Fights Germany In Front Of US Congress Members\n\nTo the left of the very nervous Travolta, reading OSA\u0027s pre-written notes, is the famous Scientologist Norman Starkey, sitting at his side and holding his hand, and to his right is Scientologist\u0060s OSA secret service boss Kurt Weiland. \n\nWhat a \u0022great\u0022 triumvirate in September 1997 in Washington.\n\nThanks to Scientology\u0027s OSA International Secret Service, an incredible, unbelievable \u0022hearing\u0022 with John Travolta, Isaac Hayes and Chick Corea and their filthy attack full of lies on the German government is carried out without anyone objecting.\n\nA big win for Scientology, for now.\n\n\nL. Ron Hubbard\u0027s estate trustee Norman Starkey died in 2019 and Scientology didn\u0027t want anyone to know\n\nTONY ORTEGA\nSEP 19, 2023\n\nBit of a bombshell from Mitch Brisker last night at his YouTube channel: He says that Norman Starkey, former captain of the yacht Apollo and L. Ron Hubbard\u2019s trustee, died back in 2019 and Scientology has kept the news suppressed ever since.\n\nWe reached out to a few people to get some reactions.\n\nHana Whitfield, a fellow South African, met Starkey when she first joined Scientology at the Johannesburg org.\n\n\u201CNorman was on staff there. He was bright, chipper, cocky, full of life,\u201D she says. She left later to serve posts in Los Angeles and then with Sea Org, becoming captain of the Avon River while Starkey was serving with Hubbard on the flagship.\n\n\u201CHe did pretty well. Hubbard liked the type of man that he was. Brusque, ready to do it all. Results were all for Hubbard,\u201D Hana says with a laugh.\n\nBut the memory of Starkey that has stuck with her, she says, happened when she first joined.\n\n\u201CAfter I first joined Scientology and left nursing, we were both staying at the home of a staff member. She had a bunch of us students and staff sleeping over at her house. One night Norman tried to make it into my bed. And I was like, get the fuck away from me, Norman,\u201D she says. \u201CNo damn way. I pushed him out. I think he was half asleep. He rolled out of bed and was gone. I wasn\u0027t having it. That sort of stuck him in my memories.\u201D\n\n\nShe says that Starkey really came into his own as a Scientology executive with the restructuring of corporations in 1981. \u201CHe got a big role as top of ASI for quite a while. And from that point on, he was a big wig. He was one of the head honchos.\u201D\n\nAlso, she says, he was willing to subjugate himself to David Miscavige, the new leader.\n\n\u201CI don\u0027t think Norman ever really much squabbled with Miscavige. I think Miscavige made his pitch and took over, and Starkey was happy to hold on to a subordinate role, I got that impression.\u201D\n\nOne of the most vivid images of Starkey was provided by Mike Rinder in his book A Billion Years, when Norman caused a bit of a scene at Tom Cruise\u2019s 2006 wedding to Katie Holmes\u2026\n\nNorman Starkey, the executor of the estate of L. Ron Hubbard and Miscavige\u2019s sidekick for years at ASI, was taken out of the Hole by Miscavige to perform as minister for Tom Cruise\u2019s wedding to Katie Holmes. As a former captain of the Apollo and Hubbard\u2019s executor, he had high status and Miscavige had talked him up to Cruise through the years. Though internally labeled a Suppressive Person, Starkey was flown to Italy to participate in the so-called wedding of the century. He got drunk at the reception and tried to hit on Brooke Shields. Brooke\u2019s husband, Chris Henchy, complained to Miscavige.\n\nStarkey was sent back from Italy in disgrace and everyone in the Hole was punished for what he had done\u2014because it was our fault that we had not handled him. Even for the twisted thinking of the Hole, it was bizarre. How could we be responsible for what Starkey had done in Italy while under the direction of Miscavige? Another piece of the puzzle fell into place. (This wedding was also the beginning of the end for Leah Remini, as it was where she famously asked Tommy Davis, \u201CWhere is Shelly?\u201D And he just as famously responded, \u201CYou don\u2019t have the fucking rank to ask about Shelly.\u201D)\n\nThat\u2019s a classic.\n\nWe asked Mike for his thoughts on the news that Starkey has been gone so long.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s pretty incredible how they keep these things under wraps!\u201D he says.\n\n\u201DHe was the \u2018Trustee\u2019 of Hubbard\u0027s estate. Once CST got tax exemption, the instructions in the will were able to be carried out and he had no further duties with respect to Hubbard\u0027s \u2018legacy,\u2019\u201D Mike adds. \u201CHe remained at ASI for some time, but I don\u2019t recall exactly how long he was there and whether it was beyond 93 or not?\u201D\n\nLike Mike, Starkey ended up in Miscavige\u2019s prison, the Hole, at least until he was needed at the Cruise wedding.\n\nBut despite those high positions, and his role at the Cruise wedding, Starkey\u2019s passing was kept quiet by Miscavige. Our thanks to Mitch Brisker for bringing the news out.",

The Secretary of State of Interior, Regensburger, who is also on Ingoldstadt\u0027s town coun- cil, identified Mr. Helnwein as \u0060\u0060an internationally known Scientologist\u0027\u0027 and therefore \u0060\u0060it would not be acceptable\u0027\u0027 if the town \u0060\u0060supports this artist with exhibition rooms and offers a platform with the use of tax moneys.\u0027\u0027\n\n\nTHE AMBASSADOR OF\nTHE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY\nWashington, September 16, 1997\nSenator Alfonse D\u0027Amato,\nChairman, Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe 234 Ford House Office Building\nWashington, DC \n\nDear Senator D\u0027Amato:\nThank you very much for your letter dated August 25, inviting a representative of the Federal Republic of Germany to testify at the pub- lic hearing \u0060\u0060Emerging Intolerance in the Federal Republic of Germany,\u0027\u0027 to be held by the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe on September 18.

As you may know, I have proposed on several occasions to meet individually with various Mem- bers of Congress to explain Germany\u0027s approach to the Scientology or- ganization. While none of your colleagues expressed an interest in an exchange of views, I would be glad to renew my offer.\nIn the meantime, I enclose a background paper outlining the German position on the Scientology organization.

Among the papers that have carried full-page ads in the last couple of years are the New York Times, the Washington Post and the International Herald Tribune. In addition, theInternational Herald Tribune published a controversial open letter to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.\nThe Scientology organization has also distributed pamphlets such as \u0060\u0060The Rise of Hatred and Violence in Germany,\u0027\u0027 reiterating its allegations.\nThe open letter to Chancellor Kohl, written by a Hollywood lawyer with famous Scientology clients, appeared in early 1997in the International Herald Tribune.",

Graham Berry alerted me to this and I subsequently confirmed\nI will post his stories.\nFly high my friend. It is a good thing he fully left the cult before he passed. RIP\n\n\nThe self killing of Quentin Hubbard - the son of L.Ron Hubbard\n\nMichael Pattinson tells why Quentin Hubbard killed himself with the age of 22, because his father L. Ron Hubbard tortured him!\n\nGeoffrey Quentin McCaully Hubbard (January 6, 1954 \u2013 November 12, 1976), was the son of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard and his third wife, Mary Sue Hubbard. He died at the age of 22 in an apparent suicide.\n\nFormer Scientologists have said that Quentin was homosexual, and that this clearly caused him a great deal of personal torment as Scientology doctrine classified homosexuals as \u0022sexual pervert[s]\u0022 and \u0022quite ill physically.\u0022 Another source close to him claims that rumors of his homosexuality were due to his sometimes claiming to be that way in order to discourage women who were interested in him, to protect them from the consequences of his father\u0027s disapproval. Quentin is described as having had a gentle demeanor, with none of his father\u0027s bombast.\n\nIn 1975, the Sea Org moved to shore in Clearwater, Florida. Quentin was assigned to operations there but was often absent. Police discovered him unconscious in his car in Las Vegas on October 28, 1976, without any identifying documents. L. Ron Hubbard was furious at the news, shouting, \u0022That stupid fucking kid! Look what he\u0027s done to me!\u0022\u200A \n\nQuentin died two weeks later without having regained consciousness.\n\nAlthough a hose connected to the tailpipe was found in the car\u0027s window, a test for carbon monoxide was negative. Mary Sue Hubbard told Scientologists that Quentin had died from encephalitis. L. Ron Hubbard is said to have deteriorated rapidly after Quentin\u0027s death, becoming dishevelled and increasingly paranoid.",

      "title": "ExScientology RPF Prisoner Susanne Schernekau,explains the \u0022rules\u0022 in that private prison in Denmark",
      "description": "This video includes the only known footages of working RPF inmates, made by Peter Reichelt hidden in a car on the parking lot across the street on the backside of the Fort Harrison hotel, renovating the hotel suites for wealthy Scientologists visiting Clearwater from around the world. \n\nSusanne Schernekau, Ex-Prisoner in the Scientology RPF, explains the \u0022rules\u0022 in that private prisons.\n\nClearwater in August 1998. We succeeded for the first time in filming a group of RPF laborers. They were renovating the Scientology Fort Harrison Hotel. Even old women are exploited for this work where it is 110 degrees in the shade. Their daily wage: $1.50.\n\nChange of Location. At the center in Copenhagen. Another hotel. This time it\u0027s the Scientology Nordland Hotel, again with an integrated reform camp. Who would be surprised that they don\u0027t want us here? We have made an appointment with the Danish woman, Susanne Schernekau. Almost two years of her life was spent here behind this facade. The organization\u0027s buildings are all over Copenhagen. All are being renovated in order to bring Scientology\u0027s customers in at a fast pace. There is much work that needs to be done. As was the case with Wiebke H., Susanne was also accused of financial manipulation.\n\nSusanne Schernekau: My offense, according to Scientology, was financial fraud, or swindling, and that I had behaved very badly, for example, in Munich I had gone with a normal person to eat. Because I was married, that was not OK.\n\nOff-camera commentator: By November 13, 1989, she had gone too far. She was assigned to the RPF in Copenhagen, as this document shows. An offense is severely punished. Scientology\u0027s ethics are synonymous with total obedience, suppression and forced re-education. That is where people end up who make mistakes. Forced laborers are produced according to need, sometime more, sometimes less.\n\nSusanne Schernekau: For instance, in Copenhagen there was a building which was a total wreck. And we cleaned it from top to bottom, cleaned all the pigeons off the window ledges, rats and mice and so forth. We began to paint, carpet, renovate, everything. We were always the last to eat. Only breakfast was really OK. Other than that the food was very bad; the beds were very bad. We slept twelve people to a room.\n\nOff-camera commentator: The solidarity of the group is emphasized, especially in the elite Sea Org. Created by Hubbard, it is the heartbeat of Scientology. His private army. They want world domination and that needs an army, and into this one come only the best. Immortality, power, consensus and invincibility. Rattling sabers and then the fall, unexpected and final.\n\nSusanne Schernekau: You live with the conviction that you already have everything under control. And when that does not happen, you realize that you do not have everything under control. And somehow the whole idea that you were part of an elite group plunges headlong into the ground. You begin the RPF with a black arm band. Then, if your ethics go well, you get a white arm band. The difference is: with the black arm band and as a married person in the Sea Org, you may not see your husband. You may not speak to him if he does not speak with you. With the white arm band you may spend three hours per week together with your second dynamic, that means your family, your husband and possibly children. You may still not speak with your husband unless he speaks to you. Then you get more. That means that you can earn a gold arm band. With a gold arm band, you may spend one night a week with your family.\n\nOff-camera commentator: You can picture the structure of the RPF as Susanne drew it up in the camp and learned by heart. Chief of the group - but a co-prisoner at the same time - is the BOSUN. Under him is the EST_O, responsible for the assignment of work, and the MAA, who is responsible for keeping the rules of the camp. Under that is the TECH, responsible for the material and the equipment. QUAL supervises the performance of the work. The rank and file form the individual sections A, B and C. Work groups have up to ten people. These are assigned to the actual renovation work - as is the case here in Clearwater. The control over each other is omnipresent and thorough. None can escape it.\n\nSusanne Schernekau: You keep all the others under observation and know that all the others are watching you and each other. That is normal. Anybody can get out of line. That means that other people bring it to your attention with a knowledge report, that you have made a mistake. That means you have to look at that mistake face on and handle it somehow, in some way. And then show the group that you have made up for it.\n\nOff-camera commentator: Those are the Knowledge Reports with which one shows his true loyalty. Everybody watches everybody else, everybody betrays everybody else and puts this down on paper. Here Susanne turns in another work group to their superiors.",

      "description": "Gerry Armstrong - The First Scientology RPF Prisoner in the Scientology Headquarter at the Fort Harrison Hotel Garage in Clearwater/Florida.\n\nInterview by Peter Reichelt with Gerry Armstrong December 6, 1998 in front of the fort Harrison.\n\nAt the Fort Harrison, Gerry Armstrong, Dennis Erlich and other RPF inmates slept in bunks on the third floor of the outdoor parking structure that adjoins the hotel, so they inhaled exhaust fumes from cars. \nApparently the women\u2019s sleeping facilities were nearby, because Anne Rosenblum wrote:\nIn December, 1978, we were moved to a storage area in the garage. It was a partly wooden, partly cement, enclosure built against one of the garage walls. It was built to be a storage area, but as the RPF grew so large, it was made the RPF\u2019s girl\u2019s sleeping area. Wooden bunks were built, that were about 1/2 to 1/3 the size of a regular twin bed. The bunks were built 3 and 4 stacks high, and were put in there side-by-side. Our \u2019mattresses\u2019 were pieces of foam cut to fit the bunks. It was like crawling into a hole to get into bed. You couldn\u2019t even sit up because of the bunk above you, and it was difficult to try to turn over because they weren\u2019t wide enough. The worst problem was that being in the garage, we inhaled all the car fumes when cars would go through, in addition to the noise of cars that [people taking courses] and staff would make dri- ving in and out.\nIt seems remarkable that health, zoning, or safety inspectors never discovered these inappropriate sleeping quarters at the Fort Harrison, but Hana Whitfield explained that \u201Dall RPFers were practised and skilled in transforming their normal RPF sleeping areas into what looked like a regular furniture storage space, and doing so in a very short period of time\u201D.\nFor all of the deprivations that RPF members suffered, they still received almost no salary. During his 1977 period in the RPF, for example, Armstrong indicated that he received about $4.30 a week for a hundred or more hours work. Likewise, \u201DIn the RPF,\u201D Robert Vaughn Young revealed, \u201DI got paid five dollars a week for fourteen months\u201D.\n\nChildren And Teens on the RPF\nNumerous indicators point to the probability that teenagers and pre-teens are subject to the RPF program. These indicators include: accounts from several former adult members; an internal Scientology document that refers to a children\u2019s RPF program; a reporter\u2019s account in a newspaper article; and television footage that apparently shows teenagers on the RPF program in Los Angeles unloading from a bus.\n\nThe RPF and Scientology\u2019s Hollywood Stars\nSocial implications exist concerning the findings of this study, specifically for one of America\u2019s largest and most profitable industries\u2013entertainment. Scientology boasts about the Hollywood stars who are proud to be members and who often serve as spokespersons for various Scientology causes. It seems likely, however, that inmates working in RPF programs built or renovated facilities that some of the Scientology movie stars use, including the renovation of the Celebrity Center in Los Angeles. Scientologist \u201DSB\u201D claims to have met both Tom Cruise and Lisa Marie Presley while working as an RPFer on these renovations. \n\nEqually serious is the probability that at least some of these prominent stars know, or ought to know, about the abusive RPF program but have not spoken out against it.",

Known by his nom de guerre, \u201CHappy Smurf,\u201D Scarff at one time was a constant presence on the Scientology online forums, and had a seemingly encyclopedic data collection about just about anyone who ever was anyone in Scientology or Scientology watching.\n\nOn the other hand, he was known for having helped Scientology\u2019s spy wing, the Office of Special Affairs, and had owned up to it. At one point, Scarff, who said in a sworn statement that he had been a Scientologist from 1982 to 1992, admitted to helping Scientology run a \u201CFair Game\u201D retaliation operation against California attorney Ford Greene \u2014 but Scientology to this day denies that Scarff was ever a Scientologist at all. The church also denies that he was working for the church to infiltrate Greene\u2019s office. \u201CThere\u2019s not a scrap of evidence to support anything he says,\u201D a church official told California Lawyer magazine in 1994.\n\nIn 2012, Scarff wrote, \u201CIt is a fact I was a long-time OSA operative that did some bad shit and hurt some people. I have spent years making amends to people. Many have been gracious with their forgiveness; several choose to hold a grudge and live with the belief \u2018once OSA, always OSA.\u2019 I can live with that.\u201D\n\nScarff was also known for lying about having a connection to the 1978 Jonestown massacre. In the late 1980s, he claimed to have been a member of the Peoples Temple and had lost a father and son in the carnage at the compound in Guyana. None of it was true, and he later said in a sworn statement that he had invented the story on orders from Scientology to create chaos for the Cult Awareness Network \u2014 but it\u2019s almost impossible to know if any of that explanation has any truth to it either.\n\nWhen we got to know Scarff in the 1990s, we knew about his flip-flopping past and let him know that we would be unable to use him as a quoted source in stories. But on the other hand, we didn\u2019t hesitate to credit him last year when he tracked down new photos of Tommy Davis hobnobbing in his new Hollywood job on behalf of Australian billionaire James Packer. (Tommy has now left that job, and is back to working in the world of real estate investment.) Over the years, Garry was always very helpful to us, and he understood that we were careful only to use information from him that could be independently verified.\n\nLast year, just a few days after Garry had found those new Tommy Davis photos, he put up a notice on his Facebook page indicating that he and his doctors had decided that his worsening health problems were going to force him to accept living at a care facility where he would have infrequent access to the Internet. After that, he posted just a few things through October.\n\nWhatever one thinks of Garry Scarff and his claims, we think it\u2019s a shame that he passed away without notice. The last time we saw him, he came out for our Los Angeles stop on our 2015 book tour. We\u2019re glad he did.",

He has made a number of statements about the inner workings of OSA, many of which are disputed by the Church. In a sworn deposition taken between July and August 1993 and submitted in Church of Scientology International vs. Steven Fishman and Uwe Geertz, Scarff testified, \u0022...I was directed, one, to go to Chicago, Illinois and to murder Cynthia Kisser, Cynthia Kisser being the Executive Director of the Cult Awareness Network, by a staged car accident.\u0022 Kisser was not killed, and Scarff said: \u0022I could not bring myself to harm or kill anybody.\u0022[18]\n\nOffice of Special Affairs (OSA), formerly the Guardian\u0027s Office, is a department of the Church of Scientology International. According to the Church, the OSA is responsible for directing legal affairs, public relations, pursuing investigations, publicizing the Church\u0027s \u0022social betterment works,\u0022 and \u0022oversee[ing its] social reform programs\u0022. Some observers outside the Church have characterized the department as an intelligence agency, comparing it variously to the CIA or the KGB.[1][2][3] The department has targeted critics of the Church with dead agent operations and character assassination.[4][5]\nOSA is the successor to the now-defunct Guardian\u0027s Office,[6] which was responsible for Operation Snow White and Operation Freakout; both are in Department 20 in the Scientology organizational chart. The most recently known Commanding Officer for OSA International is Linda Hamel,[7] succeeding Mike Rinder, who has since departed from the Church of Scientology and become a fierce critic of the organization, appearing as a co-host on Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath.",

      "description": "Mike Rinder, former Scientology\u0027s OSA (Office of Special Affairs International) secret service worldwide boss, is observing the anti-Scientology protesters like Frank Oliver and Gerry Armstrong and reporting live to David Miscavige by phone what\u0027s going on in front of the Fort Harrison Hotel - Clearwater, Dec. 5, 1998\n\n\nClearwater Picket\nAnd McPherson Memorial\n5 December 1998\n(as posted to alt.religion.scientology on 6 December 1998)\n\nSaturday\u0027s picketing started off at 10:00 in the morning. Apart from a couple of OSA photographers and a pubescent uniformed \u0022security guard\u0022 on a bicycle, the streets were barren of Scientologists. Windows all had shutters, blinds, or paper obscuring them, and only rarely did I see people stealing furtive glances through Venetian blinds.\n\nThe picketers split up into two groups: one took the Fort Harrison, and the other (the one in which I spent the morning) gathered in front of the former Clearwater Bank building. Response from the non-Scientologist public was extremely heartening; there was an almost continuous barrage of cheers, honks, thumbs-ups, and other signs of support. Notable things I heard shouted from the cars that passed: \u0022You\u0027re doing the right thing!\u0022 \u0022We want them out!\u0022 \u0022They\u0027re a murdering cult!\u0022\n\nSo one of the many times a particular green-shirted OSA photographer pointed his digital camera at me, I held my hand next to my head and started making the gesture. To my utter surprise, he immediately pivoted around and started snapping pictures of someone else! \n\nThey had several plain white vans painted with \u0022Happy Holidays\u0022 and several non-religious holiday symbols (wreaths, bows, candy canes, and so forth) which were driven around by OSA personnel. When stopped at traffic lights, they sat completely immobile, staring straight ahead. When they had to turn onto a street with picketers, they turned without looking at where they had to go! It was fortunate that they didn\u0027t cause an accident by such dangerous driving habits.\n\nAbout this time, they were trying to fill up Flag buses with people -- presumably to take them to lunch -- and it was obvious that they were trying to manoeuvre the streets in such a manner that they would avoid seeing any picketers. So some of us went up to one of the streets behind the Fort Harrison, and sure enough, along came a Flag bus. But through the tinted windows, we could see at least two hundred Sea Orgers packed in like dorm students stuffing a phone booth -- truly less than standing room only. Surely that had to be some kind of safety violation; if so, Scientology is quite willing to break the law (and endanger its people\u0027s safety) in order to keep them from seeing anything that contradicts Scientology\u0027s official line. Returning to that Ability Magazine, \u0022When individuals are restrained from confronting life they accrue a vast ability to have difficulties with it.\u0022\nAfter lunch, we returned to picket the Fort Harrison. \n\nThe police presence was strong; I counted at least 15 uniformed officers, and more who drove by in cars and vans (and one K-9 unit -- Harry, you\u0027re a good dog!) I didn\u0027t even try to get an accurate count of picketers, but I\u0027d estimate we started off with something around 30 or 40. \n\nI wondered what the OSA photographers thought about the fact that we received so much support, and not one bypasser yelled any disagreement with us.\nThe media was out in force; television cameras, newspaper and magazine reporters galore. Naturally, there were Scientology officials giving their point of view, and if I\u0027m not mistaken, I saw a very tense-looking Brian Anderson wearing eyeglasses. \n\nFlag vans -- though not the \u0022Happy Holidays\u0022 ones -- kept driving in and out of the garage, halting the picketers as they entered and exited. I thought it was strange that it was always the same four, and often they seemed completely empty (though occasionally they would have people in them). So after a line of four of them had gone in, I stood at the entrance to the garage, even after the police let people start walking again, and watched as one van after another simply turned around and came back out, halting the line again. \n\nTwo other picketers, a German man and an American woman (I\u0027ll let them tell the story more fully if they want to) wrapped themselves in the flags of their respective countries and embraced, symbolically rejecting Scientology\u0027s attempts to drive a wedge between the two countries.\nAt 7 PM, we began a memorial service for Lisa McPherson.

      "description": "Sid Klein, Clearwater Police Chief, interviewed by Peter Reichelt during the Anti-Scientology picket on Saturday, Dec. 5, 1998, in front of the Fort Harrison Hotel \n\nScientologists Attack Police Chief Sid Klein In Letter\n\nSt. Petersburg Times\nDate: December 7, 1997\nby Thomas C. Tobin\n\nThe Church of Scientology raised the temperature Saturday in its new campaign against Clearwater Police Chief Sid Klein, calling him \u0022reactionary\u0022 and bigoted, and blaming him for \u0022a two-decade pattern of discrimination\u0022 against the church.\n\nScientology also made clear that their dispute is with Klein and not other officials at City Hall.\n\nBut Klein\u0027s boss, City Manager Mike Roberto, called the church\u0027s statements \u0022extremely discouraging\u0022 and said he fully supports the chief.\n\n\u0022I think our attention really needs to be on the bigger issues in the community and not on these kinds of fights,\u0022 Roberto said. \n\nThe church kicked off the campaign against Klein Friday night as 3,000 to 4,000 Scientologists held candles and demonstrated in front of police headquarters, many of them angrily chanting, \u0022Sid Klein, what\u0027s your crime?\u0022\n\nOn Saturday, church officials turned up the heat in a nine-page letter to Klein and during interviews with reporters as about 30 anti-Scientology protesters picketed Scientology\u0027s Fort Harrison Hotel.\n\nThe pickets were marking the death of Lisa McPherson, the 36-year-old Scientologist who died in 1995 after fellow church members cared for her over 17 days. Police this month are expected to conclude their two-year investigation of the death.\n\nScientology\u0027s letter, signed by church spokesman Brian Anderson, outlined an array of grievances against Klein, at one point refering to him derisively as \u0022Big Sid.\u0022\n\nIt also demanded \u0022straight answers\u0022 to the church\u0027s questions Friday concerning police department records. The church has strongly suggested it is planning a civil rights lawsuit against the city and has put Klein on notice that he should keep any relevant documents in order, including tape recordings of his conversations.\n\n\u0022I want assurance that you aren\u0027t destroying evidence,\u0022 Anderson wrote, adding later in the letter: \u0022Stop acting like I\u0027m trying to stir up controversy. We have a several-year record of doing everything in our power to create friendly community relations.\u0022\n\nThe letter accused Klein\u0027s department of being obsessed with Scientology, of turning the McPherson case into \u0022an international incident,\u0022 and of giving aid and comfort to the anti-Scientology protesters who picketed Friday and Saturday in front of the Fort Harrison Hotel.\n\nIt said the church had records showing police stole Scientology materials during an inspection of a church property. It also said complaints of church members are too often dismissed and kept in a separate file labeled \u0022Scientologist.\u0022\n\n\u0022Enough of your disingenuous claims of objectivity,\u0022 Anderson wrote.\n\nBut he ended the letter writing: \u0022We\u0027d like to be your friend,\u0022 and offered a holiday wish for a \u0022brighter future which we all should have together.\u0022\n\nKlein could not be reached after the letter was released, but his spokesman, Wayne Shelor, dismissed it as \u0022a schizophrenic diatribe.\u0022\n\nHe said it is another Scientology attempt to \u0022subvert and pervert\u0022 the police investigation into McPherson\u0027s death.\n\nKlein was interviewed earlier Saturday after Scientology officials began to outline their positions to reporters.\n\n\u0022I fully anticipate they\u0027re going to file a lawsuit at one time or another,\u0022 the chief said. \u0022It doesn\u0027t matter what we do anyway. Then, the burden of proof will be on them.\u0022\n\nOne of Anderson\u0027s complaints was that Klein and his officers chose to stand watch over the anti-Scientology protesters Friday night instead of going to watch the church\u0027s protest against Klein.\n\nTo Anderson, that proved Klein\u0027s lack of objectivity. It demonstrated that Klein had more interest in the anti-Scientology efforts than in the church\u0027s protest.\n\nKlein said his officers were surprised Friday night when thousands of Scientologists appeared two blocks away for a march around police headquarters and the Clearwater office of the Times. He said church officials had promised not to demonstrate against the anti-Scientology protesters.\n\nChurch officials insisted Saturday they had kept their promise. They weren\u0027t counter-demonstrating, they explained. They were marching for the separate purpose of protesting Klein\u0027s policies.\n\n\u0022That\u0027s a matter of interpretation,\u0022 Klein said.\n\n\u0022All of which could have been avoided if they had just told us,\u0022 Klein said. \u0022It\u0027s their little games that are very frustrating.\u0022\n\nEpilogue: Sid Klein, Clearwater\u2019s innovative police chief, dies at 78, March 18, 2020\nIn three decades on the job, Klein built a modern police department, tackled race relations and dealt with a newcomer to town called the Church of Scientology.",

      "description": "Inside \u2018Freewinds\u2019, the Church of Scientology\u2019s ship of fear and the marriage of Melissa Paris and Cyril Helnwein, the son of celebrity Scientologist Gottfried Helnwein\n\nHere is the complete statement of the legal claim against David Miscavige:\n\nhttps://kohnswift.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ScientologyComplaint.pdf\n\nMelissa Paris, Valeska\u2019s Sister, And Her Own Ordeal in Scientology\u2019s Cadet and Sea Orgs: Forced to Marry at 16 the son of the Scientologist Gottfried Helnwein, the SeaOrg member Cyril Helnwein\n\nby TONY ORTEGA \n\nGottfried Helnwein and his son Cyril - Cyril was forced to marry his girlfriend, the only 16 yrs young SeaOrg member Melissa Paris \n\nhttps://www.villagevoice.com/melissa-paris-valeskas-sister-and-her-own-ordeal-in-scientologys-cadet-and-sea-orgs-forced-to-marry-at-16/\n\nDecember 1, 2011\nIn December of 1996, Melissa Paris was 16 years old, and had been married for a few months to a man she says she was forced to wed. An unpleasant match, the marriage ended when Melissa left him \u2014 and Scientology\u2019s hardcore and controlling Sea Org \u2014 two years later.\nBut that was in the future. In the months after her wedding, she was in a unique position, and she knew it. Her husband, Cyril Helnwein, who was himself a teenaged Sea Org member of about 18, was from a wealthy family. The son of an internationally famous artist (more on that later), Cyril had means. So, when they had returned, after the wedding, to grueling weeks of menial, unpaid labor that she had already endured for two years as an underaged Sea Org member at L. Ron Hubbard\u2019s legendary former home in England, Saint Hill Manor, she asked her rich young husband to grant her a wish.\nFly me to a ship. The Freewinds. For our honeymoon.\nMelissa asked this, not really out of a romantic notion, but knowing it might be her only chance to see her sister, Valeska, who had just been put aboard the ship against her will.\nAnd so, in December 1996, the Paris sisters were briefly reunited after not seeing or communicating with each other for two years......\n\nand this happened to her sister Valeska on the \u0022Freewinds\u0022:\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald\nBy Ben Schneiders\nApril 29, 2022 \n\nWhen Laura Baxter was accused of monopolising the attention of actor Tom Cruise aboard Scientology\u2019s Caribbean cruise ship in 2004, she says her punishment was to be locked in an \u201Cextremely hot\u201D engine room of the Freewinds ship.\nShe was shouted at by church officials and then for three days she says she was only allowed to leave to eat for a few minutes at a time or return to her room to sleep for a few hours. She had to urinate in a bin out of fear of being punished for going to the bathroom unaccompanied, she alleges.\n\nThat 2004 birthday celebration for Cruise is mentioned \u2013 although the actor is not directly named \u2013 as part of an important legal claim lodged in a Florida court that accuses Scientology of child trafficking, covering up multiple sexual assaults and forced labour. There is no suggestion Cruise was aware of Baxter\u2019s situation.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the case are all now resident in Australia. Gawain Baxter, who is a citizen, and residents Laura Baxter and Valeska Paris, are seeking significant \u201Ccompensatory and punitive damages\u201D against Scientology leader David Miscavige and five Church-related organisations for alleged human trafficking.\n\nThe three were part of Scientology\u2019s \u201CSea Org\u201D and \u201CCadet Org\u201D entities. They were required to sign billion-year contracts to provide free or cheap labour to the church. \n\nThe plaintiffs say they endured years of emotional, physical and psychological abuse, in particular while spending more than a decade aboard Freewinds in what the lawsuit described as \u201Ca world filled with abuse, violence, intimidation and fear\u201D.\n\nThe 86-page legal claim from US law firms Kohn and Cohen details allegations of how children as young as six years old were separated from their parents who relinquished custody to the \u201CCadet Org\u201D and later \u201CSea Org\u201D.\n\nWhile living on the Freewinds\u2013which never docks in US ports or territorial waters \u2013 he had his passport confiscated and worked 16 to 24 hours a day in unsafe working conditions, he alleges. \n\nThe other plaintiff, Valeska Paris, who now lives in Australia, had parents who were Sea Org members and was brought up as a Scientologist. By six years old she says she was in the Cadet Org and over more than a decade was sexually assaulted on multiple occasions as a minor, she claims.\n\nShe alleged the physical and sexual abuse was commonplace in the Cadet Org, and she had to relive her sexual assaults with adult male interrogators and was punished for reporting them. \n\nParis said she was a personal assistant to Miscavige and worked 16-hour days as a 15-year-old and was \u201Csleep-deprived, poorly fed and constantly verbally abused by adult supervisors\u201D. She said she became suicidal and eventually ended up doing forced labour at a Scientology site in Australia and had her passport confiscated.",

IRELAND - The Helnwein Scientology Celebrity Center\nANTJE VOLLMER STAYS AT GOTTFRIED HELNWEIN\u0027S IRISH HOME\nAntje Vollmer, vice-speaker of German parliament, spends her vacation at the home of Gottfried Helnwein and his family in Ireland where she meets with artists, writers, actors, musicians and other people active in the fields of culture. For the past 3 years, every summer, Gottfried Helnwein is inviting creative people from all over the world to stay at his home in Ireland.\n\n\nyou tube channel about Helnwein, Vollmer and Scientology:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWrSukZJheY\n\nTAZ - Berlin newspaper - 7. February 1998 by Axel Kintzinger:\n\n...Church and state sect commissioners are suspicious of Vollmer, who holds a doctorate in theology, above all because of her brilliant advocacy for her friend, the painter and Scientologist Gottfried Helnwein. \n\nVollmer\u0027s involvement was \u0022politically tasteless beyond compare\u0022, says Ursula Caberta, head of the Scientology working group at the Hamburg Interior Ministry. In response to Helnwein\u0027s consideration of moving his residence, Vollmer dared to make a historical comparison: \u0022It is unacceptable that German artists have to flee to America today.\u0022\n\nThis reminder of the fate of Brecht, Mann, Feuchtwanger and many others who had to leave Nazi Germany is now also too much for the Greens: \u0022A stupid statement,\u0022 judges their federal managing director Heide R\u00FChle today, \u0022incomprehensible in light of the experience of German fascism.\u0022 \n\nR\u00FChle also denies Vollmer\u0027s criticism of the Enquete Commission. It works \u0022very objectively\u0022, as R\u00FChle has convinced herself. With regard to Claudia Roth\u0027s initiative in the European Parliament, R\u00FChle is now also urging \u0022objectification of the discussion - on both sides\u0022....\n\nsome more news:\n\n...For Bonn-based sect critic Ingo Heinemann, Gottfried Helnwein is \u0022the most prominent artist Scientology can use to advertise in the German-speaking world\u0022. So far, however, the painter, who lives near Koblenz, has refused to be labeled a member of the psycho-sect. In recent years, he has brought numerous lawsuits against newspapers, television stations, party groups and individuals in order to have his contacts with the organization denied. \n\nHe has even received strong political support in these efforts: Bundestag Vice President Antje Vollmer (Greens) has repeatedly defended Helnwein from his critics. Now the painter himself is to stand trial. Scientology critic Heinemann, a lawyer on the board of a nationwide self-help organization, has filed a criminal complaint on suspicion of trial fraud....\n\n...SPIEGEL: The Hamburg Scientology commissioner Ursula Caberta has accused the Green Vice President of the Bundestag, Antje Vollmer, of possibly unsuspectingly passing on information from the commission to Scientology.\n\nAbel: This accusation is not that specific. Of course, every member of the Commission must consider what might leak out of this circle and who might benefit from such knowledge. We have no secrets, but you have to be allowed to think out loud internally.\n\nSPIEGEL: Ms. Vollmer, who supports the Scientology-affiliated artist Gottfried Helnwein, has claimed that some \u0022cult hunters\u0022 are becoming more and more like cult followers.\n\nAbel: Such statements, especially from high-ranking politicians, can easily be taken out of context and misunderstood. Ms. Vollmer herself has admitted that she still knows too little about Scientology. Perhaps it would be better to shift down a gear when making such public statements.\n\nAbel: There is no reason whatsoever to expel experts. Organizations such as Scientology and others are already trying to create a mood among politicians. The Commission\u0027s work must be all the more objective. It is about findings and facts. The politicians should then deal with them...",

He is a very good friend of mine and also an artist. Arthur always needed money, although he is financially supported by the organization. Arthur from Los Angeles came to Burgbrohl for the first time in 1986 through another Scientologist, who in turn knew Gottfried. He worked at the castle with Helnwein for several months. That was great fun. He stayed until he ran out of money and then flew back to the USA. In 1988 or 1989 Arthur had to spend several months in the RPF labor camp \u0022Happy Valley\u0022 near Los Angeles because he had once again made derogatory remarks about Scientology and his father (!). Immediately after his release at the end of 1989, he returned to Burgbrohl to Helnwein for several months for further \u0022regeneration\u0022. . \n\nIt was great for Helnwein that Arthur Hubbard lived with him for so long. He made a big deal out of it. I didn\u0027t. For me he was just Arthur and he\u0027s a clean and funny guy. That showed that I\u0027m not a \u0022good\u0022 Scientologist. For them, someone like Arthur is something very special. Gottfried treated him like a raw egg, handled him with kid gloves. Very carefully. He was very careful about what you said to him, how you spoke to him. That was totally stupid.\nHelnwein also kept auditing polders and other files on the people who were audited at the castle. Including mine. Everything I said there was written down in detail and filed by Renate Helnwein in polders and kept in the castle...\u0022\nThis is what Peter Schmitz, who lived at the Helnwein Castle in Burgbrohl/Germany for many years, had to say about his experiences at the castle with Helnwein and Arthur Hubbard...\u0022",

      "description": "Scientology and his prison camps for children, called RPF, in Clearwater/Florida and Los Angeles\n\nFootage from the German TV docu the RPF \u0022Happy Valley\u0022 by Peter Reichelt\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w68aZ_41hds\n\nPublished by:\nInterior Ministry\nD-20537 Hamburg\n\nThe Scientology Organisation, its methods, its business practices and above all its victims and their fate continue to arouse the interest of the public. In recent years various media reports have also highlited one aspect of the Organisation, the \u201DRehabilitation Project Force\u201D \u2013 or RPF.\u0022 \n\nChildren And Teens on the RPF\n\nNumerous indicators point to the probability that teenagers and pre-teens are subject to the RPF program. These indicators include: accounts from several former adult members; an internal Scientology document that refers to a children\u2019s RPF program; a reporter\u2019s account in a newspaper article; and television footage that apparently shows teenagers on the RPF program. \n\n1. Accounts About Children and Teens from Former Adult Members\nTwo adults who had been in the RPF on the Apollo reported that they knew of a pre-teen who was in the program. Monica Pignotti stated that a twelve year old girl was in the RPF during the same time that she was (Kent Interview with Pignotti, 1997: 30). Likewise, Dale related that he saw an eleven-year old girl (whom he knew) on the Apollo\u2019s RPF after he himself had been in it (Kent Interview with Dale, 1997: 4). An additional account of a child on the RPF came from Pat, who insisted that she knew a six-year-old (whom she named) who went into the program in Los Angeles because he was \u201Dout 2-D\u201D \u2013 Scientology\u2019s term for either sexual problems or family difficulties (Kent Interview with Pat, 1997a: 32). Finally, a former Sea-Org member who uses the pseudonym, Steve Jebson, posted on the alt.religion.scientology newsgroup that he had \u201Dpersonal knowledge\u201D about a twelve or thirteen year old boy being assigned to the RPF\u2019s RPF in Los Angeles (Jebson, 1997).\n2. References to Children on the RPF in a Scientology Document\nThis testimonial evidence identifies that children and teenagers were in various RPF programs with adults. An internal Scientology document, however, indicates that Hub- bard had established a special RPF for children and subsequent Scientologists in lea- dership positions reinitiated the program (presumably after it had lapsed for some reason). The available document is a poor-quality photocopy written by Nedra Cohee in 1989, who was working with the program for Sea Org children called the Cadet Org. Cohee\u2019s stated purpose for producing the letter was that s/he felt the \u201Dneed to re-insti- tute the Children\u2019s RPF...\u201D (Cohee, 1989). As background to the request for renewing the program, the author discussed its history:\nIn 1976 when the Commodore [i.e., Hubbard] re-established the Cadet Org, he also included the childrens RPF as apart of this.... In 1986-87 when myself and [another person] put back in the advices concerning the Cadet org, the re-instituting of the Childrens RPF was very instrumental as one of the successful actions done which 10X\u2019d [knocked out?] the Cadet Org at that time.\nThe Childrens RPF was run per the FO\u2019s [sic: Flag Orders, which are similar to Sea Org policy letters] on the Childrens RPF (3434 series)... (Cohee, 1989).\nIf this passage is accurate, then Hubbard himself established the Children\u2019s RPF in 1976, and policies exist about its operation in the Flag Order 3434 Series dedicated to the RPF in general.\nThe one page letter or memo also provides insight into the lives of children in and associated with the Cadet Organization. Cohee wrote that there were \u201Dseveral Cadets and blown Cadets [i.e., runaways] who need to go to the children\u2019s RPF.\u201D While most of the Cadets were improving and \u201Dproducing,\u201D \u201Da very small percentage are enturbu- lative [i.e., disruptive] sources and are sabotaging efforts to set the scene right.\u201D One boy (named in the text) was a special problem, and:\nhe needs to be moved off everyone\u2019s lines [i.e., taken out of the orga- nization\u2019s daily operations] and put into the Childrens [sic] RPF. [He] recently took a razor blade and cut X\u2019s in his skin up and down both arms. He is psychotic in PT [present time] and needs close supervision (Cohee, 1989).\nIn summary, some of the children in the Cadet Org were disruptive to the point of running away, and one obviously troubled youth was self-mutilating. Cohee\u2019s respon- se, however, was to advise that the boy should receive close supervision in the Child- ren\u2019s RPF program, but never recommended professional counselling or other profes- sional assistance for him.\nA final indicator that teens are RPF inmates comes from a 1984 newspaper article published in the Clearwater Sun:\rThe young man \u2013 by all appearances a teen-ager \u2013 crouched on the dark, narrow stairway as he scrubbed the sixth-floor landing in the former Fort Harrison Hotel, the \u2019flag Land Base\u2019 headquarters of the Church of Scientology...\u0022",

Kopie an Robert Sch\u00F6ller und Gudrun.\n\nHELNWEIN WISSENSBERICHT\n\nBETRIFFT: ROBERT SCH\u00D6LLER UND GUDRUN\nBurgbrohl, 25. September 1985\nVor zwei Wochen besuchte mich mein Freund Robert Sch\u00F6ller hier in meinem Haus ( in Burgbrohl d.A. ) , seine 2. Dy ( Zweite Dynamik = Ehefrau oder Lebensgef\u00E4hrtin d.A. ) Gudrun begleitete ihn. Bevor Ro\u00AD\nbert Gudrun nach Flag brachte, hatte sie gegen\u00FCber SCN ( Hubbards Lehren d.A. ) eine sehr ablehnende Haltung . Das war ungef\u00E4hr vor einem Jahr, ich schrieb damals einen Wissensbericht an den FSO MAA (ranghoher Ethikoffizier in Flag / Clearwater d.A.) . Robert blieb f\u00FCr etwa ein Jahr in der FSO (Flag Service Organisation in Clearwater d.A.), ging nach OT 3 hinauf und hatte viele Gewinne, er arbeitete auch am Restaurationsprojekt.\nZur gleichen Zeit bewegte sich Gudrun fast nicht auf der Br\u00FCcke, und wie mir Robert bei seinem letzten Besuch hier erz\u00E4hlte, ist sie be\u00AD z\u00FCglich SCN noch immer unsicher. Laut Robert hat sie noch Freunde, die gegen SCN sind. Weiter sagte mir Robert, da\u00DF Gudrun in New York einen ausgestiegenen Klasse 12 Auditor ( Helnwein ist ein Klasse 4 Auditor d.A. ) traf, der ihr sagte, da\u00DF SCN ein Schei\u00DFdreck sei.\nRobert sagte mir au\u00DFerdem, da\u00DF Gudrun die OT 3 Daten kennt. Ich fragte ihn: \u0022Wer hat es ihr verraten?\u0022 Er sagte: \u0022Ich habe vergessen sie danach zu fragen, ich wei\u00DF es nicht. \u0022\nGudrun enturbulierte auch meine Umgebung hier, als sie mit Robert hier wohnte, ohne mich danach zu fragen, versuchte sie einen meiner Mitarbeiter von seinem Posten abzuziehen ( off post d.A. ) , damit er einen Job f\u00FCr sie erledigen sollte, ohne mich zu fragen.\nDies ist richtig. gezeichnet: Gottfried Helnwein \u0022\n\nGUDRUN DERLIN\nWie verlief die Beziehung zu Sch\u00F6ller ? Gudrun Derlin in ihrer autobio\u00AD graphischen Darstellung im M\u00E4rz 1997 weiter: \n\u0022 Ostern 1982. Mit 30 Jahren begegne ich Robert, einen hochbegabten Wiener Maler in Ham\u00ADburg. Beginn einer Liebesbeziehung und Entschlu\u00DF ihn zu managen. Umzug nach Wien. Aufregendes Leben aus Koffern. \nEs verst\u00E4rken sich die Partnerprobleme. R.S. kann nicht mehr verbergen, da\u00DF er Scientologe ist. Er wurde Anfang der 70er Jahre von seinem Wiener Malerfreund Gottfried Helnwein, w\u00E4hrend sei\u00ADnes Studiums auf der Akademie f\u00FCr Bildende Kunst in Wien, \u0022 in Sciento\u00ADlogy \u0022 hineingezogen. \nKurz darauf besuchte Gudrun Derlin, zusammen mit ihrem Freund, Helnwein auf dessen Schlo\u00DF in Burgbrohl. Das Ende ist bekannt.\nZusammenfassend analysiert Gudrun Derlin ihr Erlebtes mit Heln\u00ADwein: \n\n\u0022Sehr bezeichnend f\u00FCr mich ist, da\u00DF sich Helnwein oft in Milit\u00E4r\u00AD kluft ablichten lie\u00DF. Er offenbart, auch f\u00FCr den neutralen Beobachter deutlich sichtbar, gleich zweifach sein wahres Wesen: seine Sympathie f\u00FCr den Faschismus sowie sein Bed\u00FCrfnis etwas verbergen zu m\u00FCssen, mit einem Tarnanzug. \u00C4hnlich verh\u00E4lt es sich mit Helnweins jahrzehn\u00ADtelangem Verstecken seiner Vollglatze unter diversen schwarzen lang\u00ADhaarigen Per\u00FCcken. Wie mir Robert erz\u00E4hlte, fielen Helnwein Mitte der 70er Jahre in Wien innerhalb kurzer Zeit alle seine Haare, auf die er im\u00ADmer so stolz gewesen war, aus. \n\nAnla\u00DF soll eine schiefgelaufene Auditing\u00AD Sitzung gewesen sein. Mehr wollte er dazu nicht sagen. PR Genie Heln\u00ADweins Ziel war und ist es, ich h\u00F6rte es Anfang der 80er Jahre sehr oft aus seinem Mund, w\u00E4hrend diverser Abendessen in seiner Wiener Privat\u00ADwohnung, weltber\u00FChmt zu werden, egal wie, man analysiere seine \u0022Schockbilder\u0022, hinter denen \u00FCbrigens auch ein St\u00FCck Scientologyideo\u00ADlogie steht -, um dadurch als Meinungsmacher Einflu\u00DF auf die \u00D6ffent\u00ADlichkeit zugunsten von Scientology zu gewinnen.\n\nIch lernte Helnwein als radikal den Hubbardschen \u0022 Lehren \u0022 hinge\u00AD gebenen J\u00FCnger kennen. Seine Sprache war immer scharf und kompro\u00AD mi\u00DFlos \u0022 pro Scientology \u0022 und contra den \u0022 aberrierten ( verr\u00FCckten ) Rest der Welt \u0022, insbesondere vermeintliche Scientology Gegner! Ei\u00AD nes seiner Lieblingsw\u00F6rter war z.B. \u0022 gnadenlos \u0022. \n\nEr litt unter starken Minderwertigkeitskomplexen und hoffte sie wohl durch Scientology abbauen zu k\u00F6nnen. Durch ihn wurde mein damaliger Freund Robert Sch\u00F6ller zu Beginn der 70er Jahre in Wien \u0022 on lines \u0022 gebracht, d.h. f\u00FCr Scientology angeworben. \n\nHelnwein ist ein T\u00E4ter, kein Opfer! \u0022",

They were roused at 6:30 am and given half an hour to carry out cleaning assignments. At 7 am they were formed up into seven different Divisions, each under a Division Head, for a morning muster in front of the Commanding Officer Cadet \u2013 a fellow Cadet. The children stood to attention with the Division Heads saluting while the Master-at-Arms, another child, read out a military-style report on each Division\u0027s status. Uniforms were inspected and the personal hygiene of each child was checked, with their breath and armpits smell-tested and their hair inspected for lice.[4]:\u200A52\u201353\u200A\nPunishments were imposed for lateness or failing inspections. Lateness was particularly harshly punished, ranging from being issued with a chit to having a bucket of ice water poured over the offender\u0027s head. Failing a berthing inspection would result at the very least in receiving a chit. An offender might alternatively be ordered to white-glove the room (cleaning it so well that a person wearing white gloves could run their hands over the surfaces without getting them dirty) or in extremis being ordered to sleep overnight in Pig\u0027s Berthing, an old mattress in a rat- and bat-infested derelict building on the site.[4]:\u200A52\u201353\u200A Zoe Woodcraft, who was there at the same time as Miscavige Hill, wrote that she recalled \u0022two girls about nine years old who were forced to spend the night there and in the middle of the night they ran screaming and crying from the building.

      "description": "Der Wirtschaftsjournalist Wolf Lotter sprach 1994 im Rahmen einer Reportage des \u00F6sterreichischen Magazins Profil mit David Miscavige. Es war eines der ganz wenigen Print-Interviews, die Miscavige weltweit jemals gegeben hat \u2013 insgesamt waren es genau zwei. 2010 interviewte ich wiederum Lotter dazu \u2026\nWenn Sie sich an die Situation des Interviews zur\u00FCckerinnern: Wie war ihr Eindruck, ihr Gef\u00FChl in Bezug auf die Person von David Miscavige?\nWolf Lotter: \u201EWer glaubt, dass David Miscavige oder andere Scientology-Gr\u00F6\u00DFen irgendwie \u201Aabgedreht\u2018 sind, der irrt sich. Das sind Profis. Ich hatte den klaren Eindruck, mit Marketingprofis an einem Tisch zu sitzen. K\u00FChl, professionell und unverbindlich. Also, es ist nicht so, dass er im Gespr\u00E4ch explodiert, wenn ein Journalist ihm aus der ziemlich langen Liste belastender Aussagen \u00FCber Scientology vorliest. Stellen Sie sich einfach den Vorstandsvorsitzenden eines weltweit arbeitenden Konzerns vor. Und stellen Sie sich vor, dem sagt man beispielsweise, das in einer seiner Fabriken Giftgas ausgetreten ist. Der Mann wird wahrscheinlich weder zu heulen anfangen noch zu toben, sondern sich ruhig hinsetzen und sagen: \u201ADar\u00FCber haben wir keine qualifizierte Information\u2018 und auch wenn sie Zeugenaussagen, Bilder, Fotos und andere Dokumente vorlegen, solange die ganze Geschichte abwiegeln, wie seine Anw\u00E4lte durchhalten.\nEs ist ja merkw\u00FCrdig, dass so viele Leute glauben, wenn es um Sekten, Kirchen, Religionen oder andere Unternehmen aus der \u00DCbersinnlichkeits-Industrie geht, dass deren Repr\u00E4sentanten sozusagen vom eigenen \u201ASpirit\u2018 ergriffen sind. So ist das nicht. Die handeln als k\u00FChle Manager. Und so reden sie auch.\u201C\nWie stand es mit Sympathie oder Antipathie?\nWolf Lotter: \u201ENun, ich habe vor dem Interview eine Reihe von ziemlich kritischen Beitr\u00E4gen \u00FCber Scientology ver\u00F6ffentlicht. Aber Scientology konnte mir nichts anhaben. Dass das nicht gerade dazu f\u00FChrt, dass man sich ineinander verliebt, k\u00F6nnen Sie sich vielleicht vorstellen. Aber nochmals: Ich kann nicht behaupten, dass mir eine offensive Aggressivit\u00E4t, so wie ich Sie durchaus aus den Briefen und Reaktionen von Scientology auf meine Arbeit kannte, bei meinem Interview in Los Angeles entgegen strahlte. Man war sachlich.\u201C\nWarum glauben Sie, hat er Ihnen bzw. dem Profil dieses Interview gew\u00E4hrt? Miscavige tritt ja sonst \u00F6ffentlich kaum auf?\nWolf Lotter: \u201EDass sich Scientology darauf eingelassen hat, wundert mich eigentlich heute noch. Ich kann nur vermuten, dass es eine Rolle gespielt hat, dass zwei hochrangige Scientologen in der unmittelbaren Umgebung von Miscavige \u00D6sterreicher waren, der damalige Chef des B\u00FCro f\u00FCr Spezielle Angelegenheiten Kurt Weiland beispielsweise. Ein Spa\u00DFvogel, wie er im Buche steht: Er begr\u00FC\u00DFte mich am Hollywood Boulevard mit einem breiten \u201AGr\u00FC\u00DF Gott\u2018.\u201C\nHatten Sie w\u00E4hrend des Interviews das Gef\u00FChl, dass er bestimmten Themen bewusst auswich bzw. sie ihm unangenehm waren? Wenn ja, bei welchen Themen hatten Sie dieses Gef\u00FChl?\nWolf Lotter: \u201ENicht das Gef\u00FChl, sondern die sichere \u00DCberzeugung. Alles, was Scientology vorgeworfen wird, ist im Grunde nach Miscavige nichts weiter als feindliche Propaganda. Das sind nat\u00FCrlich die Grenzen des Machbaren eines Frage-Antwort-Interviews: Wenn der Gespr\u00E4chspartner grunds\u00E4tzlich alle Themen, die kritisch sind, mit dem Hinweis abblockt, das sei erfunden, \u00FCbertrieben oder schlicht eine Gemeinheit, dann k\u00F6nnen Sie im Grunde nichts anderes tun, als die Dokumente und Aussagen, die diese Vorw\u00FCrfe st\u00FCtzen, in einem gesonderten Text zu ver\u00F6ffentlichen.\nStellen Sie sich folgende Situation vor: Sie konfrontieren den Scientology-Chef mit sehr klaren Aussagen eines ehemaligen f\u00FChrenden Scientologyfunktion\u00E4rs zum Thema Finanzen und den Umgang mit Mitgliedern. Der sagt: \u201AAlles L\u00FCge. Alles nicht wahr. Rache!\u2018 Was ich damit sagen will: Man kann viele dieser Fragen in einem Interview nicht kl\u00E4ren.\nViel aufschlussreicher war eigentlich meine Tour durch die angeschlossenen Scientology-Anstalten, etwa das sogenannte Celebrity-Center, in dem Promis wie Tom Cruise und John Travolta auftauchten \u2013 und eine Handvoll B- und C-Schauspieler. Mir hatte man zum Beispiel eine Drehbuchautorin aus Deutschland aufgedr\u00E4ngt, die einen ziemlich wirren Eindruck gemacht hat. Das Management wei\u00DF, was es tut. Das Fu\u00DFvolk nicht.\u201C\n\nEs geht darum, etwas zu verkaufen. Make money, make more money \u2013 das alte Credo von Hubbard.\u201C\n\nDas Interview mit Wolf Lotter f\u00FChrte Wilfried Handl, langj\u00E4hriger Scientology-Aussteiger und damaliger Chef von Scientology-\u00D6sterreich.",

All we knew at the time was that it was top secret.\nOur helicopter flight begins at minute 10:35 - the destination was the RPF (Rehabilitation Project Force) prison camp \u0022Happy Valley\u0022 and the secret Scientology World Headquarters GOLD near Gilman Hot Springs. \nWe wanted to find Wiebke Hansen, a German Scientologist who had been missing for years and was supposedly very famous at the time.\nFrom minute 44.40, our adventure to reach the \u0022Happy Valley\u0022 prison camp by car begins from my camera perspective. We had flown over it by helicopter a few hours earlier. Now we wanted to fight our way through by car. We made it through the Soboba Indians\u0027 territory, but then, 2 miles before the RPF gate, it began: the grand entrance of Ken Hoden, Managing Director of Golden Era Productions.\nLet us surprise you with what follows...\n\nPeter Reichelt / Germany\n\n15.

Zu seiner Verbindung zu Scientology sagt er nur wenig\nOlga Kronsteiner, Peter Reichelt, Fabian Schmid\n21. Oktober 2023, 07:00\n696 Postings\n\nGottfried Helnwein z\u00E4hlt zu den prominentesten K\u00FCnstlern \u00D6sterreichs und wird hierzulande entsprechend hofiert \u2013 von Museumsmanagern, vom Kunsthandel und auch von Regierungsprominenz. Oft traf der K\u00FCnstler etwa Ex-Kanzler Sebastian Kurz (\u00D6VP): 2018 bei der ersten Ringturmverh\u00FCllung mit einem Sujet Helnweins (I saw this), kurz darauf beim Staatsbesuch in Irland, im Bundeskanzleramt (2018, 2020) und beim Weihnachtspunsch. Wer sich bei solchen Auftritten in wessen Ruhm sonnte, blieb unklar.\nZwischendurch kam sogar die Idee eines eigenen Museums auf, wie der \u0022Malerf\u00FCrst\u0022 im aktuellen News-Interview erz\u00E4hlt. Vor Jahren schon habe ihm der damalige nieder\u00F6sterreichische Landeshauptmann Erwin Pr\u00F6ll (\u00D6VP) ein solches angeboten, zuletzt soll auch Kurz diesen Wunsch ge\u00E4u\u00DFert haben. \u0022Wer wei\u00DF, was die Zukunft bringt\u0022, merkt der zwischen Irland und Florida pendelnde K\u00FCnstler an. Sein k\u00FCnstlerischer Nachlass, so viel steht schon fest, wird in \u00D6sterreich eine Heimat finden: nicht in der Albertina und auch nicht am Standort des ehemaligen Essl-Museums, das er \u0022als Museum meiner Werke\u0022 f\u00FCr \u0022v\u00F6llig ungeeignet\u0022 h\u00E4lt, wie auf Anfrage in Erfahrung zu bringen war.\n\nUm Worte selten verlegen\n\nDie f\u00FCr sein Business relevante B\u00FChne bekommt Helnwein, der am 8. Oktober seinen 75. Geburtstag feierte, schon l\u00E4nger von Albertina-Direktor Klaus Albrecht Schr\u00F6der: etwa ab kommender Woche mit der zweiten gro\u00DFen Retrospektive (\u0022Realit\u00E4t und Fiktion\u0022) innert zehn Jahren, zus\u00E4tzlich zur Pr\u00E4sentation seiner Arbeiten zu anderen Gelegenheiten oder mit Gastauftritten im Youtube-Kanal des Museums, wo er \u00FCber Werke der Klassischen Moderne doziert.\n\nUm Worte ist Gottfried Helnwein selten verlegen, insbesondere nicht, wenn es um die Gefahren der Political Correctness oder die zunehmende kommerzielle Orientierung der Kunst geht. Oder auch um Donald Trump, der die Pr\u00E4sidentschaftswahl der USA 2024 gew\u00E4nne, so er nicht vorher eingesperrt, umgebracht \u0022oder die Wahlen massiv gef\u00E4lscht\u0022 w\u00FCrden, wie er News jetzt erkl\u00E4rte.\n\nWor\u00FCber der K\u00FCnstler dagegen \u00F6ffentlich nicht zu sprechen bereit ist: \u00FCber seine Verbindungen zu Scientology, die er in der Vergangenheit teils vehement bestritt. Dem STANDARD vorliegenden Dokumenten zufolge wurde Helnwein im Jahr 1972 Mitglied dieser umstrittenen Organisation. Deren Boss David Miscavige gr\u00FCndete 2018 den Privatsender Scientology-Network, auf dem Helnwein mit einer Doku (Gottfried Helnwein and the Dreaming Child, 2011) gefeaturt wird.\n\nDie allj\u00E4hrlich anl\u00E4sslich des Geburtstags ihres Gr\u00FCnders L(afayette) Ron Hubbard veranstaltete Gala im Scientology-Mekka Clearwater (Florida) besuchte das Ehepaar Helnwein zuletzt 2019 ebenso wie den anschlie\u00DFenden \u0022Patrons\u0022-Ball f\u00FCr Gro\u00DFspender der Organisation. Solche Veranstaltungen sind nur Mitgliedern vorbehalten. Seit der Pandemie fanden keine mehr statt.\n\n... Auf einen langen Fragenkatalog sowie Nachfragen \u2013 etwa zu seinem Erscheinen bei der Scientology-Gala \u2013 reagierte Helnwein nicht.\n\nObwohl er aus Sicht von Scientology wohl wertvolle Arbeit geleistet hat, wie die Organisation in ihren Medien \u00FCber die Jahre berichtete. Etwa als er 1976 in Wien mit dem sogenannten Zentrum f\u00FCr Kunst und Kommunikation ein \u0022Celebrity Center\u0022 gr\u00FCndete. Diese Organisationseinheiten sind f\u00FCr die Gewinnung von Prominenten zust\u00E4ndig, um sie f\u00FCr Propagandazwecke zu nutzen.\n\nDie Auseinandersetzung mit den Themen Schmerz, Verletzung und Gewalt pr\u00E4gt das Schaffen des 1948 in Wien geborenen K\u00FCnstlers, wobei ihm \u0022die Figur des verletzbaren und wehrlosen Kindes\u0022 als zentrales Motiv dient, ist auf der Website der Albertina nachzulesen. Berichten in Scientology-Publikationen zufolge vertreten diese Werke beispielhaft die Doktrin Hubbards: etwa wenn es um \u0022den chemischen Krieg gegen Kinder\u0022 geht, die Helnwein als \u0022Pillenz\u00F6glinge\u0022 visualisiert.\nFragen dazu lie\u00DF Helnwein, wie erw\u00E4hnt, unbeantwortet \u2013 auch jene, ob sich dieser Faktor f\u00FCr den Verkauf seiner Kunst (an Scientology-Kunden) als f\u00F6rderlich erwiesen habe......\n\nWarum sich Helnwein trotz seiner langj\u00E4hrigen Mitgliedschaft partout nicht zu Scientology bekennen will, war f\u00FCr den STANDARD nicht aufkl\u00E4rbar...\n\nIn einem Mail an die Autoren des Artikels beschwert sich die Ehefrau des K\u00FCnstlers \u00FCber die Recherche..\u0022Es ist offensichtlich, dass Sie einen Hassartikel schreiben werden und meinem Mann schaden wollen\u0022, beklagt Renate Helnwein, w\u00E4hrend ihr Mann beredtem Schweigen den Vorzug gibt. \n\n(Olga Kronsteiner, Peter Reichelt, Fabian Schmid, 21.10.2023)",

Helnwein hatte sich dagegen verwahrt, als Scientologe bezeichnet zu werden. In einem Proze\u00DF, den er gegen die Scientology-Kritikerin Jeannette Schweitzer angestrengt hatte, bekr\u00E4ftigte er dies mit einer eidesstattlichen Versicherung.\n\nJetzt outete Scientology sein prominentes Mitglied.

Helnwein tingelte Mitte Januar durch Regierungs- und Parlamentskreise in Washington, um Stimmung gegen Deutschland zu machen. Der Hamburger Anwalt Ralf Burmester pr\u00FCft derzeit eine weitere Strafanzeige wegen falscher Abgabe einer eidesstattlichen Versicherung. Im Fall einer Verurteilung drohen Helnwein bis zu drei Jahre Haft oder eine Geldstrafe.\n\nHelnwein und Scientology - 1997\nL\u00FCge und Verrat\nvon Peter Reichelt\nVerlag Brockmann und Reichelt\nISBN 3-923801-93-9\n\nSchon der Schutzumschlag macht Freude: es ist eine bissige\nscientology-bezogene Parodie des ber\u00FChmten \u0022Gabel\u0022 Bildes, von Gerhard\nHaderer. Ich selbst habe mindestens zehn scientology-bezogene B\u00FCcher\ngelesen; neue B\u00FCcher bringen somit kaum neues und sind schnell\n\u00FCberflogen. Dieses Buch ist jedoch anders, weil es scientology anhand\neines scientologen und seines Dunstkreises darstellt: den Maler\nGottfried Helnwein.\n\nAuf fast 500 Seiten wird die Geschichte eines Mannes erz\u00E4hlt der\njahrelang so sehr log, da\u00DF sich eigentlich s\u00E4mtliche Balken in den\nGerichtsgeb\u00E4uden h\u00E4tten biegen m\u00FCssen. Doch er kam damit durch, und warb\nsogar Unterst\u00FCtzer aus Presse, Fernsehen und Politik, die halfen ihn als\nden armen Verfolgten der fanatischen Sektenj\u00E4ger darzustellen. Egal\nwelche Beweise die Kritiker brachten - er stritt es einfach ab.\nDokumente wurden als F\u00E4lschungen dargestellt, Namenseintr\u00E4ge in\nscientology-Listen wurden abgestritten. F\u00FCr Helnwein war bei Bedarf zwei\nplus zwei eben f\u00FCnf oder drei. Doch nun ist eine\nerdr\u00FCckende Menge an Beweisen in einem *einzigen* Buch zu finden. Diese\nBeweise sind nicht nur Ver\u00F6ffentlichungen von scientology selbst,\nsondern viele Briefe in Helnwein\u0027s eigener Handschrift. Dies m\u00FC\u00DFte f\u00FCr\nziemliche Verwirrung bei den scientologen f\u00FChren. \n\nIm Gegensatz zu Autoren, die aus vorauseilendem Gehorsam nicht mal Namen\nnennen die jeder aus der \u0022Szene\u0022 kennt, nennt Reichelt Ro\u00DF und Reiter\nund druckt die Beweise schwarz auf wei\u00DF.\n\nDas Buch belegt wie Helnwein seit einem viertel Jahrhundert scientologe\nist.\nIn den 90ern wollte er davon nichts mehr wissen: er war kein\nscientologe, war nie einer gewesen, h\u00E4tte nur mal \u201Eein paar Kurse\u0022\ngemacht; wer etwas anderes druckte, bekam ein Proze\u00DF an den Hals.

      "description": "Berliner Zeitung vom 14.10.1996 - von Liane v. Billerbeck und Frank Nordhausen\nDer Pop-K\u00FCnstler Gottfried Helnwein und sein merkw\u00FCrdiges Verh\u00E4ltnis zur Scientology-Sekte: Die Hand, die ihn f\u00FCttert\nSchwarze Hippiem\u00E4hne, Stirnband und Sonnenbrille - das ist der exzentrische Gottfried Helnwein. Der einstige Schockmaler aus Wien ist inzwischen arriviert und hat gro\u00DFe Ausstellungen. Doch seit zwei Monaten agieren Helnwein und seine Freunde vor allem in den Medien. Sie erz\u00E4hlen von einer fast unglaublichen Rufmordkampagne: Verschw\u00F6rer wollten den Maler vernichten; deshalb verleumdeten sie ihn als \u0022Oberpriester\u0022 der Scientology-Sekte. Die Folge: Galeristen z\u00F6gen sich zur\u00FCck, Ausstellungen w\u00FCrden abgesagt. Sind das Hirngespinste, oder hat der K\u00FCnstler wirklich m\u00E4chtige Feinde?Der wahre Hintergrund der Aff\u00E4re hat nichts mit Ger\u00FCchten zu tun, sondern mit einem Gerichtsurteil, das erst jetzt bekannt wurde. Doch \u00FCber dessen Inhalt wollte der K\u00FCnstler nicht so gern reden, als er letzte Woche bei \u0022Boulevard Bio\u0022 Platz nahm; Thema: \u0022Ge\u00E4chtet und ausgegrenzt\u0022. Da erz\u00E4hlte er lieber wieder die Geschichte seiner Verfolgung. Weil er in seiner Jugend neben Yoga auch ein paar Scientology-Kurse besucht habe, werde er nun von \u0022Sektenj\u00E4gern\u0022 gehetzt, die ihn als Scientologen \u0022enttarnen\u0022 wollten. Seine Burg in der N\u00E4he von K\u00F6ln, so behaupteten seine Gegner, sei \u0022gar kein Atelier, sondern ein Tarn-Atelier\u0022, er selbst w\u00FCrde Menschen per \u0022Gehirnw\u00E4sche\u0022 in die Sekte holen.Dem treuherzigen Alfred Biolek versicherte Helnwein, Unbekannte h\u00E4tten sogar bei ihm eingebrochen; sp\u00E4ter seien Sammler vor ihm gewarnt worden. Als Hinterm\u00E4nner der \u0022Kampagne\u0022 vermutet er hysterische Pfarrer, die in ihren Kirchlein s\u00E4\u00DFen und auf \u0022sp\u00E4te Rache\u0022 f\u00FCr seine blasphemischen Bilder und seine Kritik am Katholizismus s\u00E4nnen. So entstehe ein Klima, \u0022das mich lieber ins Ausland gehen l\u00E4\u00DFt\u0022, sagte Helnwein. Danach erschien die Bundestagsvizepr\u00E4sidentin Antje Vollmer und nannte den K\u00FCnstler ein \u0022edles Wild\u0022, das geschlachtet werde, weil seine Kunst so provokativ sei.... Anl\u00E4sse daf\u00FCr gibt es zuhauf. Fast keine der Erz\u00E4hlungen des Malers h\u00E4lt einer kritischen \u00DCberpr\u00FCfung stand. Gottfried Helnwein, der nie Scientologe gewesen sein will, war in Wahrheit 20 Jahre lang der wichtigste Werbetr\u00E4ger der Sekte in Deutschland. Immer wieder wurde er in Scientology-Publikationen abgebildet und zitiert. \u0022Scientology hat bei mir eine Bewu\u00DFtseinsexplosion ausgel\u00F6st\u0022, sagte er schon 1975 in der Sektenpostille \u0022College\u0022. Als der Scientology-Guru L. Ron Hubbard 1986 starb, kondolierte der Maler mit anderen in einer FAZ-Anzeige: \u0022Hubbard hat nicht nur K\u00FCnstler inspiriert, sondern auch das Leben vieler Menschen bereichert.\u0022Helnwein-Bilder schm\u00FCckten sogar die Titel scientologischer Publikationen; das Sekten-Blatt \u0022Source\u0022 listete ihn und seine Frau jahrelang als Kursteilnehmer auf. 1990 verk\u00FCndete Helnwein in der Brosch\u00FCre \u0022L. Ron Hubbard - Der Autor und sein Werk\u0022: \u0022Scientology ist der gr\u00F6\u00DFte Durchbruch in der Geschichte der Erforschung menschlichen Denkens und Verhaltens.\u0022 Wenn es je einen deutschen Scientology-Prominenten gab, dann Gottfried Helnwein.Auch ehemalige Scientologen haben den Maler als Sekten-Genossen in Erinnerung. Doch merkw\u00FCrdig: Seit etwa 1991 gibt der K\u00FCnstler in der \u00D6ffentlichkeit das St\u00FCck: \u0022Bin ich\u0027s oder bin ich\u0027s nicht?\u0022 Er behauptete pl\u00F6tzlich, und auch wieder bei Biolek, all die Ver\u00F6ffentlichungen seien \u0022ohne sein Wissen\u0022 passiert; er habe der Scientology jetzt schriftlich untersagt, ihn zu zitieren. \u0022\u00DCber 20 Jahre will er davon nichts gemerkt haben - wer soll das denn glauben?\u0022 wundert sich der Bonner Sektenexperte Ingo Heinemann... Weil Helnwein jedoch nicht einen Beweis daf\u00FCr bringen konnte, da\u00DF er die Sekte wirklich abgemahnt hatte, erlebte er im Juni vor Gericht sein Waterloo - und das ist wohl auch der Grund, warum er so stark in die Medien dr\u00E4ngt. Helnwein war gegen eine Kritikerin vorgegangen, die ihn als Scientologen bezeichnet hatte. Doch das Oberlandesgericht Frankfurt am Main urteilte letztinstanzlich: \u0022Diese Behauptung ist wahr, denn Gottfried Helnwein ist Scientologe. Er bekennt sich jedenfalls zu dieser Organisation. Dies ergibt sich aus zahlreichen Umst\u00E4nden.\u0022 Das Verfahren f\u00F6rderte auch ein Scientology-Schreiben von 1992 zutage, wonach der Maler eine Lithographie \u0022zum Zwecke der Unterst\u00FCtzung von Narconon und OSA\u0022 auf den Markt bringen wolle - das eine ist eine scientologische Tarnorganisation, das andere der sekteneigene Geheimdienst...  Wof\u00FCr andere Gelder bestimmt waren, versuchen zur Zeit die Steuerfahnder in Koblenz herauszufinden, die im Fr\u00FChjahr das Malerdomizil Burg Brohl durchsuchten und dabei - wie jetzt durchsickerte - auf brisante Dokumente gesto\u00DFen sein sollen. Der Schl\u00FCssel zur Aff\u00E4re Helnwein? Sicher ist: Wer bei Recherchen auf besserverdienende Scientologen st\u00F6\u00DFt, stellt oft fest, da\u00DF sie auch Helnwein-Bilder kaufen... Scientologen sind offenbar gute Kunden: Man bei\u00DFt eben nicht in die Hand, die einen f\u00FCttert.",

      "description": "Date: Tue, 01 Feb 2000 16:33:19 -0800 \nStacy Brooks in Clearwater, Florida/USA\n\nThis morning Mark Bunker went with German film maker Peter Reichelt and Hans Michael Kassel, director of documentary film for the German TV station ARD, to Gottfried Helmwein\u0027s house on Palm Bluffs Road, about a mile and a half north of 33 N. Ft. Harrison. Gottfried is a Scientology artist in Germany who has apparently been denying he is a Scientologist, and Peter and Hans Michael were here gathering documentary footage to prove he is an active Scientologist.\n\nPeter asked Mark to go with them to Gottfried\u0027s house so Mark could video them walking up to the door of the house and knocking on the door. They had consulted with Wayne Shuler, the Clearwater Police Public Affairs Officer, about what they could and could not legally do, and they followed his direction to the letter.\n\nAs Mark was videotaping, a man ran out of Gottfried\u0027s house and assaulted Mark with a hammer. He hit Mark\u0027s camera twice but luckily did not hurt Mark, although Mark was extremely frightened and shaken when this man ran at him and struck him with a dangerous weapon. Fortunately Mark was able to get the assault on videotape and it will be available on Xenu-TV in about an hour.\n\nThe man then went back into the front door of Gottfried\u0027s house, and soon after that two police officers arrived. One of them, Officer Holsombach, works for the Church of Scientology at the white lines on Watterson Avenue as a paid gun to harass the staff of the Lisa McPherson Trust in his off hours. Mark spoke to the other one, Officer Kelly, and told him that a man had just assaulted him with a hammer and asked the officer if he wanted to see it on videotape. But Officer Kelly ignored what Mark was telling him. Instead, he asked Mark if he had informed the man that he was audiotaping him. Taken aback by the question, Mark replied that he had not. Then Officer Kelly told Mark that he was going to arrest him for audiotaping the hammer-wielding man without his knowledge!\n\nAt that point Mark called me and told me he was about to be arrested. I jumped in my car and went down to Gottfried\u0027s house. When I got there I saw two police cars and Mark, Peter and Hans Michael with the two police officers. There was also another elderly man that I didn\u0027t know. He turned out to be a groundskeeper for the Helmvein property.\n\nPeter was trying to talk to Officer Kelly but I could see that it was just getting him more and more aggravated and upset, so I told Peter to be quiet and let this police officer calm down, otherwise Mark was going to be arrested. The atmosphere was very highly charged and I was very worried about how Mark was going to be treated by these officers. They were obviously biased against Mark because they were doing nothing to apprehend the man who had assaulted Mark. Officer Kelly told Mark he knew he was part of LMT, and he asked the two Germans if they were also part of LMT.\n\nFortunately within a few minutes Sergeant John Zegzdryn arrived on the scene. I have had dealings with Sergeant Zegzdryn before and know that he is a fair, unbiased police officer. I was greatly relieved when he arrived.\n\nAs Officer Kelly was telling them that they could be arrested, he was addressing his comments particularly to Mark. When the groundskeeper gave them the official warning, he wasn\u0027t concerned about Mark at all and directed his statement to the two Germans who had actually walked up to the door of the house, while Mark had stayed on the public sidewalk\n\nThen Officer Kelly released them and told them they were free to go.\n\nThis was apparently all that was going to be done until Mark protested that nothing had been done about the man who had assaulted him with the hammer.\n\nThen Sergeant Zegzdryn called Officer Kelly across the street again and he then approached Mark to see if he wanted to file a complaint about the man with the hammer. Sergeant Zegzdryn was the first one who was willing to watch the videotape of the assault. Officer Kelly hadn\u0027t even been interested in looking at it. Mark said absolutely yes, he wanted the man arrested. The officers then spent time taking reports from everyone who had been there, and Mark repeated several times that he wanted the man arrested. But the police officers then told us that they were not going to arrest the man, that they were going to refer the matter to the state attorney\u0027s office.\n\nBob has already spoken to Doug Crowe in the state attorney\u0027s office and made it clear that we expect aggravated assault charges against this man.\n\nI\u0027ve just found out that the man who assaulted Mark with the hammer is named Richard Bernard, who is listed in Scientology cult publication \u0022Source Issue #80\u0022 among other cult publications.\n\nStacy",

      "description": "Helnwein and Scientology\nLies and Betrayal\nby Peter Reichelt\nPublished by Brockmann and Reichelt\nISBN 3-923801-93-9\n\nAlready the dust jacket is a pleasure: it is a biting\nscientology-related parody of the famous \u0022Gabel\u0022 picture, by Gerhard\nHaderer. I myself have read at least ten scientology-related books, so new books hardly bring anything new and are quickly skimmed.\n\nThis book, however, is different, because it presents scientology by means of\nscientologist and his circle of vapors: the painter Gottfried Helnwein.\n\nThe story of a man who lied so much for so many years that all the beams in the courthouses should have bent.\n\nBut he got away with it, and even recruited supporters from the press, television and politics, who helped him as the poor persecuted of the fanatical sect hunters. \n\nNo matter what evidence the critics brought - he simply denied it.\nDocuments were presented as forgeries, name entries in\nscientology lists were denied. For Helnwein, if necessary, two\nplus two was five or three. This went well for a while, because not\nevery critic had the overview; but then everything collapsed when\nhe lost a lawsuit against two critics. Nevertheless, he continued to deny\neverything and his willing helpers helped him. On the Internet\na number of clues had already appeared on the Internet; but now a\noverwhelming amount of evidence in a *single* book. \n\nThis evidence are not only publications of scientology itself,\nbut many letters in Helnwein\u0027s own handwriting. This should cause\nquite a bit of confusion among scientologists. Rumor has it that\nscientology spokeswoman Sabine Weber is already completely desperate,\nfears for her own future.\n\nIn contrast to authors who, out of anticipatory obedience, do not even mention names\nthat everyone in the \u0022scene\u0022 knows, Reichelt names horse and rider\nand prints the proofs black on white, and if it must be, even\neven Helnwein\u0027s signature on a painting is strongly enlarged,\nmaking the telltale \u0022OT\u0022 sign appear, the \u0022T\u0022 in the \u0022O\u0022.\n\nThe book proves how Helnwein has been a scientologist for a quarter of a century\nand that he has reached the OT5 and CL4 levels. \nHe joined Scientology in 1972; from 1974 to 1977 he directed the Center for Art and Communication, a kind of \u0022Celebrity Center\u0022 in Vienna. Then he kept more in the\nbackground; in 1985, Helnwein started a kind of \u0022secret\u0022 Celebrity Center in his castle at Burgbrohl. \n\nEven Hubbard\u0027s son Arthur was a guest for almost a year.\n\nIn the 90\u0027s he didn\u0027t want to know about it anymore: he was not a scientologist, was never one.\nhad only done \u0022a few courses\u0022; those who printed something else, got a lawsuit on his neck. \n\nThe money \u0022donated\u0022 by him and his wife Renate for \u0022just a few courses\u0022 is estimated at\nEURO 1.000.000.\nThe defendants could not have known that Helnwein had written to a scientology\nfunctionary with \u0022Dear Terminal\u0022. Since our fax may be intercepted, in the future I want to receive all \nComm only via the OSA computer\u0022. \n\nIt is to be hoped that prosecutors will buy this book, read it, and then prosecute Helnwein and his aides, Helnwein and his helpers for continued trial fraud.\n\nThe book was written in part in collaboration with ex-scientologist\nMartin Ottmann, who helped to evaluate documents and organizational structures.\nand organizational structures. (Martin appeared on the WDR program, and writes\noccasionally in alt.religion.scientology). Peter Reichelt himself does not belong\nnot part of the \u0022critic scene\u0022, but was from 1987 to 1993 Helnwein\u0027s\nadvisor and agent. This also makes the book special.\n\nIn addition to documents from Helnwein, television, courts and from the Internet\nthere are also facts that have not been known before: a raid in Austria, Hubbard\u0027s cooperation with Leni Riefenstahl, a conviction of Dietmar Sch\u00F6nherr (\u0022Raumschiff Orion\u0022), speculations about\nthe cause of Helnwein\u0027s hair loss, a high scientology credit of Bernhard \u0022Roncalli\u0022 Paul, a gentleman from the Federal Post Ministry, a sad letter from Carl Barks, and a\nSTASI-like report by Helnwein about the girlfriend of an artist-colleague. \n\n\u00A9 Tilman Hausherr - 1997",

      "description": "Garry Scarff, former Scientology OSA Agent, Interview by Peter Reichelt March 12.1998 in Los Angeles at his home in Downtown L.A..\n\nGarry Scarff, 1956-2017: A complex figure and dogged researcher\n\nBy Tony Ortega | October 31, 2017\n\nThanks to Jeffrey Augustine, we received confirmation Monday night that Garry Scarff died on April 12 at the age of 60, apparently without notice in the Scientology critic community.\n\nThat\u2019s a shame, because for all of the bizarre \u2014 and questionable \u2014 chapters of his life, Scarff was, at least to us, one of the most dedicated researchers into Scientology that we ever met, and someone we always enjoyed talking with.\n\nGarry Lynn Scarff was born on August 17, 1956. Known by his nom de guerre, \u201CHappy Smurf,\u201D Scarff at one time was a constant presence on the Scientology online forums, and had a seemingly encyclopedic data collection about just about anyone who ever was anyone in Scientology or Scientology watching.\n\nOn the other hand, he was known for having helped Scientology\u2019s spy wing, the Office of Special Affairs, and had owned up to it. At one point, Scarff, who said in a sworn statement that he had been a Scientologist from 1982 to 1992, admitted to helping Scientology run a \u201CFair Game\u201D retaliation operation against California attorney Ford Greene \u2014 but Scientology to this day denies that Scarff was ever a Scientologist at all. The church also denies that he was working for the church to infiltrate Greene\u2019s office. \u201CThere\u2019s not a scrap of evidence to support anything he says,\u201D a church official told California Lawyer magazine in 1994.\n\nIn 2012, Scarff wrote, \u201CIt is a fact I was a long-time OSA operative that did some bad shit and hurt some people. I have spent years making amends to people. Many have been gracious with their forgiveness; several choose to hold a grudge and live with the belief \u2018once OSA, always OSA.\u2019 I can live with that.\u201D\n\nScarff was also known for lying about having a connection to the 1978 Jonestown massacre. In the late 1980s, he claimed to have been a member of the Peoples Temple and had lost a father and son in the carnage at the compound in Guyana. None of it was true, and he later said in a sworn statement that he had invented the story on orders from Scientology to create chaos for the Cult Awareness Network \u2014 but it\u2019s almost impossible to know if any of that explanation has any truth to it either.\n\nWhen we got to know Scarff in the 1990s, we knew about his flip-flopping past and let him know that we would be unable to use him as a quoted source in stories. But on the other hand, we didn\u2019t hesitate to credit him last year when he tracked down new photos of Tommy Davis hobnobbing in his new Hollywood job on behalf of Australian billionaire James Packer. (Tommy has now left that job, and is back to working in the world of real estate investment.) Over the years, Garry was always very helpful to us, and he understood that we were careful only to use information from him that could be independently verified.\n\nLast year, just a few days after Garry had found those new Tommy Davis photos, he put up a notice on his Facebook page indicating that he and his doctors had decided that his worsening health problems were going to force him to accept living at a care facility where he would have infrequent access to the Internet. After that, he posted just a few things through October.\n\nWhatever one thinks of Garry Scarff and his claims, we think it\u2019s a shame that he passed away without notice. The last time we saw him, he came out for our Los Angeles stop on our 2015 book tour. We\u2019re glad he did.",

      "description": "Former Scientology Celebrity Artist Michael Pattinson Interviewed on March 9. 1998 in Los Angeles by Peter Reichelt for German TV \n\nKaren#1:\n\u0022I am sorry to report that our friend and wonderful Activist Michael Pattinson OT 8 has passed in April 2019. Michael was ripped off of $1/2 million dollars before he was put in lockdown in isolation on Freewinds...\u0022 \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/michael.pattinson1?fref=gs\u0026eid=ARCFFv9rKEeTMcCm-ASz4KK6Sg6KbxFofNkUODS2JluEuXKdCUr6GjMMCr2MNwK_OAbioQZRgEApxBAE\u0026dti=493248644086306\u0026hc_location=group\n\nMichael Pattinson:\n\u0022I completed New OT8 in February 1990 after being in Scientology since 1973. During that period I was mainly \u0022public\u0022 but did several years as a staff member in Paris Org as Qual Sec. I was a Scientology celebrity as an international fine artist, creating beautiful paintings of \u0022visualized\u0022 music. Many Scientologists (thousands) knew me personally from my art tours of orgs and missions in the early 1980s.\n\n1975 and later...\n\nThe whole crew and the most recently arrived \u0022public\u0022 (Hubbard term for clients of his organizations) all went by coach from Daytona Beach over to Clearwater late in 1975.\nWe arrived at the old Jack Tar Hotel on S. Ft Harrison Avenue and were assembled to be briefed on rooms, facilities etc. I the rooms there were the normal beds, drapes, shag carpets,...but no TVs. The hotel was clean-ish but was in relatively old condition.\nThe place was, however, a far better size and layout than the Neptune Motel, which was small in comparison.\n\nWe knew we had to lie, but we had no choice as the instruction came from the Guardian\u0027s Office\u0022 and from Ron Hubbard, who was \u0022in a secret location\u0022 locally. I did once see him drive by in a gold colored Cadillac but that was the only time I ever saw him.\nWe were to do our courses full-time and be totally dedicated to the job of getting done with our (vast) training programs and get back to our organizations as soon as possible.\n\nWhen the \u0022cover\u0022 was blown by the local press and Mayor Cazares we got a note from Ron that said \u0022look at these wogs; they get a person\u0027s \u0022withhold (secret) off, and then kick him when he is down!\u0022 We left it up the Guardian\u0027s Office to handle the resulting \u0022flap\u0022 (chaos created by Scientology but blamed on wogs).\n\nMy training was intensive and we were all studying up on the 11th floor above the ballroom. I did my daily training routines with Quentin Hubbard, as were both British and got on very well. I would try to bullbait him in the required communication drills but it was difficult to make him crack up or laugh. He looked mostly depressed and \u0022regrettably present\u0022. I used to ask him about Ron and being the son of the \u0022Source\u0022 of Scientology but he was not very open about it and I got a very definite impression that he wished he wasn\u0027t. We became very good friends in the time that followed. he also like my artwork (I had some photos of it). \n\nI also became good friends with Arthur Hubbard, the artist, and we spoke on many occasions. I was intending to publish a book on art and include Hubbard\u0027s Art Series in it. I had a contract with L. Ron Hubbard (secured via a senior Exec Rick Merwin) and Arthur made a cartoon \u0022Tone Scale\u0022 of emotions to be part of the book. Unfortunately, due to staff work schedules and lack of funds it never got published.\n\nI became good friends with Diana Hubbard, and Suzette too. They all knew me on a close first name basis and were specially interested in me as an artist. I never met Mary Sue Hubbard, or ever saw her at the Flag Land Base in Clearwater. Ron was also never seen there.\n\nMy own training went on, with some difficulty, as I felt out of my depth in the Class 12 internship with auditors who were leagues and parsecs ahead of me. Dennis Erlich was the junior Cramming Officer and was truly horrible. Anger and resentment was the underlying tone of the Flag internships. David Mayo was the senior Case Supervisor. Ray Mithoff was the Flag senior Case Supervisor. It was a close knit group of fanatical devotees tied together by frayed nerves.\n\nDavid Miscavige was, when I saw him, a tiny and wiry \u0022Commodore\u0027s Messenger\u0022 (Hubbard had made himself a Commodore of the Sea Org) who was officious and obnoxious like a mini tin-pot teen tyrant who had gotten out of hand and needed to be spanked by his Mom.\n\nOne of the most shocking but frequent occurrences was a staff member suddenly being marched off by Gestapo-like uniformed people and taken to the basement where they were forced to live in squalor and humiliation. They were not allowed to speak to any one who was not in the \u0022Rehabilitation Project Force\u0022 (RPF), had to wear dark blue overalls, run EVERYWHERE, clean the grounds of the hotel for most of the day, and study 5 hrs a day too. \nThey were literally outcasts and slaves, right in the U.S.A. Hidden but there, total slaves supposedly on a \u0022Bridge to Total Freedom\u0022...\u0022\n\nhttp://www.xenu-directory.net/critics/pattinsonm1.html",

Vaughn agreed to go back to the RPF because he truly believed that it was essential to life for him to remain a Scientologist. And this is the only way that they permit you to stay a Scientologist. For this reason people put themselves through the most humiliating, abusive and horrible experiences that you can imagine, for this deceptive and delusional idea.\n\nJesse Prince: Just like in a prison. Get up, wash, get dressed, all in ten minutes. Then you stand outside and shiver all over. In the early morning it is ice cold, everybody in a row. They count off like in jail, to make sure nobody has taken off. They tell you what your work is for that day. 20 minutes to eat and then off to the bus for work at headquarters.\n\nOff-camera commentator: In the near vicinity of the company\u0027s private golf course and the football field in Gilman Hot Sprints is another attraction in the Scientology program: a circular spot. In the middle is a palm tree. That\u0027s not meant for harmless games, that spot is for running. Today clockwise and tomorrow counter-clockwise around. The newest edition is said to be a water sprinkling system for overheated souls.\n\nJesse Prince: He put a big may pole up at his headquarters and his people had to run around it all day long. Further punishment for that part of the elite who have suddenly become a problem for David Miscavige. You run from sunrise until night, until you go to bed, always in circles, day and night, for weeks on end.\n\nStacy Brooks: Twelve hours a day around the pole, until you realize that you have done something wrong and you can think straight again. That is when you again be a proper Scientologist.",

      "description": "December 1997 - scientology \u0022RPF RPF\u0022 prisoner dressed in black together with an blue dressed RPF inmate in Clearwater, Florida, USA, on top of the roof of OSA HQ, Cleveland ST corner N Fort Harrison Ave, never seen before footage of an \u0022RPR RPF\u0022 scientology prisoner by TV - journalist Peter Reichelt from Germany.\nThis footage finally did not made it into the 1998 German TV documentary \u0022Missing in Happy Valley\u0022 about the Scientology RPFs \u0022Happy Valley\u0022, \u0022GOLD\u0022, Kopenhagen and Clearwater.\nThe footage was made on top of the Bank of America building in Clearwater on Cleveland Street.\n\nThe Creation of the RPF\u0027s RPF\nOn April 24, 1974, a Flag Conditions Order established the RPF\u0027s RPF. This program received people who were on the RPF but not progressing satisfactorily, or who thought that their assignment to the RPF was humorous. As Hubbard reported in his \u0022management technology\u0022 dictionary:\n[t]he first RPF\u0027s RPF assignment was made because the person considered their [sic] RPF assignment amusing, an award [sic] and was therefore unable to recognize a need for redemption or any means to effect it. Until such time as the person recognized this need and of their [sic] own self- determinism requested to be included in the RPF redemption actions, the [RPF\u0027s RPF] restrictions applied\u0022 (Hubbard, 1975: 451 [emphasis in original]).\n\nPeople on the RPF\u0027s RPF were segregated from the RPF inmates in their work assignments, eating, sleeping, roll-call, and other activities. They were not paid, did not receive auditing, were not to receive more than six hours sleep, and received triple ethics penalties for offenses. Reflecting the fact that the RPF\u0027s RPF began on a ship, inmates in the program were allowed to work only \u0022on mud boxes in the E/R [engine room].\u0022 Moreover, they were allowed to communicate only with the person in charge of the RPF, and could \u0022not join RPF fully until acceptable amends [were] made to all RPF members\u0022 (Hubbard, 1975: 451 [emphasis in original]).\n\nThe long sought Scientology cult \u0022Flag Order 3434RB\u0022, \u0022Rehabilitation Project Force\u0022, 7 January 1974.\nBackground: Brainwashing in Scientology\u0027s Rehabilitation Project Force (RPF) (University of Alberta)\nTHE REHABILITATION PROJECT FORCE\nExcerpts:\nUNIFORMS\nThe RPF members wear BLACK boilersuit, or ethnically acceptable cleaning outfit in very dark blue.\n2.

      "description": "Gerry Armstrong  - German TV Interview by Peter Reichelt on Dec.6.1998 - Scientology RPF in Clearwater, including an Interview with former Clearwater Police Chief Sid Klein and footage with former OSA boss Mike Rinder in front of Fort Harrison. \n\nGerry Armstrong:     \u0022I am an ordinary man who for over twenty years has been the target of extraordinary persecution by the U.S.-based Scientology organization. My case exemplifies a new type of \u0022religious\u0022 persecution being perpetrated by Scientology, persecution reinforced by the American justice system and government. But my case is not unique. There are thousands of people, including many here in Europe, who are similarly persecuted by Scientology. Mine, however, is the best-documented example, because of its duration and because of the steadfast refusal God has given me to be crushed or shuddered into silence. This synopsis can but scratch the surface of my story.\n\nInside Scientology\n          I was inside Scientology for over twelve years, from 1969, to when I escaped in 1981. For eleven years I was in the organization\u0027s inner pseudo-military core, the Sea Organization (SO). There I held a number of key positions, including the Legal Officer, Public Relations Officer and Intelligence Officer on board the organization\u0027s \u0022Flagship Apollo,\u0022 from which Scientology was managed and controlled internationally. I worked with Scientology founder and director and SO Commodore L. Ron Hubbard on board the ship, and later in Florida and California.\n\n \n\nHubbard\u0027s Biography Researcher\n          In my final two years in the SO, I had the task of collecting and assembling an archive of Hubbard\u0027s personal documents, and doing research for his biography. During the course of my research, I discovered and documented that Hubbard had lied about virtually every part of his life, including his education, degrees, family, explorations, military service, war wounds, scientific research, the efficacy of his \u0022 sciences\u0022 - Dianetics and Scientology - along with the actions and intentions of the organizations he created to sell and advance these \u0022sciences.\u0022\n          When I attempted to get Scientology executives to correct the lies that the organization was promoting about Hubbard, and which Hubbard promoted about himself, I was attacked and ordered to be security checked. A \u0022sec check\u0022 is an invasive, incriminatory Scientology interrogation technique using its E-meter lie detector. During my years in the SO, I had been subjected to hundreds of hours of sec checks, and had twice been ordered by Hubbard to the Rehabilitation Project Force (RPF) [1], the organization\u0027s punishment and reprogramming camps, for a total of twenty-five months. Rather than being again locked up and forced to submit to further abuse and degradation, I fled.\n\nFair Game\n          Immediately after leaving the organization, I became a target of Scientology\u0027s basic philosophy, policy and practice for dealing with criticism or opposition, which the organization calls \u0022Fair Game.\u0022 In one short description of this noxious concept, Hubbard wrote:\n\n\u0022ENEMY - SP Order. Fair game. May be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist. May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed.\u0022 [2]\n\n          An \u0022SP\u0022 in Scientology terminology is a \u0022Suppressive Person, \u0022 considered by the Scientologists to be supremely evil, without any rights, and meriting destruction. Scientology declared me a Suppressive Person in early 1982 and has been subjecting me to Fair Game ever since.\n\n          Pursuant to its Fair Game doctrine, Scientology or its agents have:\n\nassaulted me on multiple occasions;\nterrorized me on the freeway;\nstolen photographs from me;\nbroke into my car and stolen documents, a manuscript and original artwork;\nspied on me;\nthreatened to assassinate me;\nthreatened my family;\nharassed my neighbors;\npaid a corrupt police officer for a fake authorization to eavesdrop on me and my attorney and tap our telephones;\nillegally videotaped me;\nattempted numerous times to have me prosecuted on false criminal charges, including with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation;\nsued me six times;\ndriven me into bankruptcy;\ncarried out covert intelligence operations against me; and\ndefamed me with hundreds of Black PR publications.\n          Black PR or Black Propaganda is Scientology\u0027s policy and practice of destroying a person\u0027s reputation or public belief in him by willful and relentless slander and libel.

      "description": "Rare Footage made in August 1998 out of a car from the Parking Lot Downtown Clearwater/ South Osceola Ave facing the backside of the Scientology Fort Harrison Hotel\nThe Fort Harrison Hotel serves as the flagship building of the Flag Land Base, the Church of Scientology\u0027s spiritual headquarters in Clearwater, Florida, US. It is owned and operated by the Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization, Inc., a subsidiary of the Church of Scientology International.\nThe hotel has 11 stories and features 220 rooms, three restaurants, a swimming pool and a ballroom. The building is connected by a skywalk to the Flag Building.\n\nBRAINWASHING IN SCIENTOLOGY\u2019S REHABILITATION PROJECT FORCE (RPF) - Stephen A. Kent (PhD) Professor-Department of Sociology University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada: \n\u0022I also have viewed video footage that Peter Reichelt shot in Clearwater, Florida in December 1997 and August, 1998, which shows RPF members at work on Scientology facilities (Fort Harrison).\u0022\n\nOuttake from the 1999 German TV Movie \u0022Missing in Happy Valley\u0022 by Peter Reichelt:\n\u0022Off-camera commentator: The solidarity of the group is emphasized, especially in the elite Sea Organization, Sea Org for short. Created by Hubbard, it is the heartbeat of Scientology. His private army. They want world domination and that needs an army, and into this one come only the best. Immortality, power, consensus and invincibility. Rattling sabers and then the fall, unexpected and final.\n\nFormer RPF prisoner: Susanne Schernekau: You live with the conviction that you already have everything under control. And when that does not happen, you realize that you do not have everything under control. And somehow the whole idea that you were part of an elite group plunges headlong into the ground. You begin the RPF with a black arm band. Then, if your ethics go well, you get a white arm band. The difference is: with the black arm band and as a married person in the Sea Org, you may not see your husband. You may not speak to him if he does not speak with you. With the white arm band you may spend three hours per week together with your second dynamic, that means your family, your husband and possibly children. You may still not speak with your husband unless he speaks to you. Then you get more. That means that you can earn a gold arm band. With a gold arm band, you may spend one night a week with your family.\n\nOff-camera commentator: You can picture the structure of the RPF as Susanne drew it up in the camp and learned by heart. Chief of the group - but a co-prisoner at the same time - is the BOSUN. Under him is the EST_O, responsible for the assignment of work, and the MAA, who is responsible for keeping the rules of the camp. Under that is the TECH, responsible for the material and the equipment. QUAL supervises the performance of the work. The rank and file form the individual sections A, B and C. Work groups have up to ten people. These are assigned to the actual renovation work - as is they case here in Clearwater. The control over each other is omnipresent and thorough. None can escape it.\n\nSusanne Schernekau: You keep all the others under observation and know that all the others are watching you and each other. That is normal. Anybody can get out of line. Those are the people who least want to know themselves. That means that other people bring it to your attention with a knowledge report, that you have made a mistake. That means you have to look at that mistake face on and handle it somehow, in some way. And then show the group that you have made up for it.\n\nOff-camera commentator: Those are the Knowledge Reports with which one shows his true loyalty. Everybody watches everybody else, everybody betrays everybody else and puts this down on paper. Here Susanne turns in another work group to their superiors. The smallest necessity in the RPF camp must be asked for in writing. Susannne requested, \u0022I have only one work suit and no cap. Without a complete uniform I am breaking the regulations, and I have to wash my clothes urgently.\u0022 Request denied. Instructions: \u0022Wash your work clothes at night and hang them in the boiler room so that they will be dry in the morning.\u0022",

      "description": "25. February 1999 - The ARD - German TV film by TV journalists Peter Reichelt and Ina Brockmann about Scientology\u0027s RPF prison camps in USA and Europe:\n\nMissing in the Scientology RPF \u0022Happy Valley\u0022?\nThe reformatories of the Scientologists\nTV - ARD - SWR / NDR / HR / 3 SAT and ORF / 1999 and 2000 - since 2000 various repeats\n\nStuttgart News\nBACKGROUND, 25.02.1999: \nWhen people disappear in the \u0022Happy Valley\u0022 Scientology educates \u0022doubters and failures\u0022 behind barbed wire according to its own methods Stuttgart - Scientology maintains penal camps. Until now, there was hardly any information about it. And certainly no pictures. The Mannheim TV journalist Peter Reichelt has succeeded in tracking down reformatories, so-called RPF\u0027s (Rehabilitation Project Forces) of the Scientology group.\nBy our reporter ANTON NOTZ \nTwo hours by car from Los Angeles, in a desert-like landscape, lies \u0022Happy Valley.\u0022 David Miscavage, the head of Scientology, has built an empire nearby that is as luxurious as it is mysterious. In \u0022Happy Valley,\u0022 however, things are different than in Club Med. Around 100 people from the elite Sea-Org unit have to do their penance here. \u0022The people are real prisoners. They are absolutely not there voluntarily,\u0022 says Gerry Armstrong, ex-coordinator of the Scientology secret service OSA, who says he spent two and a half years in penal camps. \nJesse Prince, formerly the second man in the Scientology leadership behind Miscavage, tells Reichelt on camera what goes on behind barbed wire and video-monitored walls. The camp internees have to work day and night like slaves. Prince also speaks from his own experience. He went through Happy Valley for disobeying orders. \u0022It was absolutely horrible. I slept in a chicken coop on the floor, rattlesnakes and scorpions all around me.\u0022 Hard labor, forced hypnosis, brainwashing - according to dropouts, these are the methods Scientology uses to bring \u0022doubters and failures\u0022 back in line. Not all, but those who are significant for the organization because they know too much or are an important cog in the world-spanning money machine. \nHow one has to rehabilitate oneself in a penal camp in Copenhagen is described by a once high-ranking Scientologist thus: No newspaper, no radio, talking to no one, eating everyone else\u0027s garbage, always working. Everyone is watching everyone else. With \u0022knowledge reports\u0022 one blackens the others. The Californian penal camp inside Miscavage\u0027s golden cage has another special feature, which Peter Reichelt discovered during a flight over the area: the \u0022track. Jesse Prince explains: Here, some \u0022deadbeats\u0022 run around a pole for twelve hours in order to become decent Scientologists again. \nPrince has freed himself from the clutches of the cult group. After numerous death threats, he lives separately from his family to protect them. Peter Reichelt and his colleague Ina Brockmann, who were forcibly detained by Scientology members on the open street during filming, have meanwhile completed a film that will be broadcast today at 10:45 p.m. on S\u00FCdwest 3. \nStill living in the \u0022Happy Valley\u0022 is 51-year-old Wiebke Hansen, in Hamburg for ten years one of the most successful Scientology managers worldwide. In 1995, she disappeared without a trace, but her brother Jochen K\u00F6rner is now back in contact with her. He was recently able to visit her for a day in Hollywood. Wiebke Hansen produces advertising films for Scientology. In the evening, she returned to \u0022Happy Valley\u0022 more or less voluntarily. \u0022Re-education camps, we\u0027ve had all that before,\u0022 says Jochen K\u00F6rner, perplexed. \n\nFrankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\nby Michael Hanfeld\n25.02.99 \nHubbard\u0027s Camp\nScientology up close: \u0022Missing in Happy Valley?\u0022 \nWibke H. was high up. She steered the fortunes of her company throughout Germany. In the first years of her work, she was able to report constantly increasing sales to the headquarters in the United States. Her precipitous fall came when new disciples increasingly failed to materialize. This earned her a trip to \u0022Happy Valley,\u0022 where she is probably still today, and where, according to the research of Peter Reichelt and Ina Brockmann, it can hardly be very pleasant. For \u0022Happy Valley,\u0022 according to the findings and the statements of the two television journalists, is a re-education camp where disgraced members of the Scientology organization are kept like slaves and subjected to nasty ordeals. \nA former security chief of the organization, for example, reports on camera how the head of the Scientology security police \u0022SeaOrg,\u0022 David Miscavige, gets rid of disagreeable employees. \nThe authors let the brother of the disappeared Wibke H., with regard to the methods of Scientology described by them, formulate the conclusion: \u0022We\u0027ve been through this before.\u0022",

      "description": "A documentary about Scientology\u2019s Rehabilitation Project Force (the RPF) from producers Peter Reichelt and Ina Brockmann. The RPF is a prison and labor camp of Scientology. Ina Brockmann and Peter Reichelt have had nothing to do with sheriffs since the cowboy and Indian games of their childhood. In March 3, 1998, however, the natives of Mannheim received a letter at home from Larry D. Smith, the sheriff of Riverside County, California. The reason was that both freelance journalists were held by force on a public road for two and a half hours in the San Jacinto Mountains by members of the controversial Scientology organization in March. They had been filming a documentary about the organization\u0027s prison camp. The Scientology staff was investigated for unlawful detention and unlawful coercion, as Reichelt told the paper \u0022Mannheimer Morgen\u0022. The primary accused include Ken Hoden, second man after David Miscavige in the organization.   \n\u0022The jig is up,\u0022 shot through the heads of both Mannheim natives as it became obvious to them that they had been trapped. But one thing at a time. For years, Reichelt had been trying to show the true face of Scientology. In 1997 he published an explosive book which turned out to be one big accusation against Scientology starting from page one and going through page 489. In Spring he and his co-producer, Ina Brock, flew to the USA for a week to deliver the first photographs of the Scientologists\u0027 forced labor camp to the world. They had several names of Scientologists from their relatives in Germany, who had not seen any sign of life from them for years. Among them was Wiebke Hansen. She had been chief of the German offshoot of Scientology, and had apparently disappeared from the face of the earth in Fall of 1995. In California, the native of Mannheim hired a cameraman, a former police sergeant, as well as a pilot together with his helicopter and headed out in the direction of \u0022Happy Valley.\u0022 Life in the valley is - in spite of the name - anything but happy. In his book, Reichelt cited sworn testimony given by a former presiding member of US Scientology in 1994 before a judge. Andre Tabayoyon was not only an adherent of the empty teachings of L. Ron Hubbard, but had even been his butler before he left the sect - as security director. He described the camp as comparable to \u0022a type of gulag or concentration camp.\u0022 Several small, secret prison and work camps were supposed to be in the desert-like setting of \u0022Happy Valley.\u0022 According to Tabayoyon, high ranking Scientologists who had begun to doubt the teachings, as well as members of the Sea Organization elite unit, were interned there. Round the clock they were said to be under guard by armed watchmen who forced them to work. In addition, they underwent hours-long brainwashing sessions every day. According to Tabayoyon, 60 children and youths as well as 30 adults live in the camps today. Late in the morning of March 9, both of the curious Germans flew the 40 minutes from Palm Desert to the highly secret camp. From their lofty height, they spotted over 20 children and youth. \u0022When the caretakers noticed our helicopter, they quickly drove the camp inmates into the barracks,\u0022 said Reichelt. \u0022They immediately put several jeeps in motion in order to follow us on the ground.\u0022 Reichelt and his crew circled the area and let the cameras roll. Then they traveled back to the landing field. Somebody was already waiting for them... By motor vehicle they traveled - pressed and pursued by four passenger vehicles and jeeps, photographed and filmed by Scientologists - back again in the direction of \u0022Happy Valley.\u0022 They drove past \u0022Gold,\u0022 the secret seat of Scientology Chief Miscavige in Gilman Hot Springs. The name, \u0022Gold,\u0022 comes from the fortune in gold bars which are stored underground there, and which are under heavy guard, according to Tabayoyon.  \nThe Mannheim residents were driving through an Indian reservation on a public road. At that point, they recalled the warning given to them by the German consulate in Los Angeles that this area, \u0022because of the trigger-happy Indians\u0022, should only be visited with bullet-proof vests. However, the danger was lurking elsewhere: suddenly Ina Brockmann had to stamp on the brakes - a yellow bulldozer blocked the road. To the right and left were large trees, so that there was no way of getting around it. Behind that were two automobiles. Brockmann tried to turn around, but the pursuers, along with a white delivery van, cut off her retreat. Men sprang out of the cars and surrounded the vehicle of the people who had intruded into the secret world of Scientology - who were travelling, as mentioned, on a public road. \u0022You are Germans. You are all under arrest,\u0022 screamed the ringleader, who turned out to be Scientology Vice-chief Ken Hoden. Along with five armed men, he tried to intimidate Brockmann and Reichelt. His purpose was to obtain the surrender of the videocassette....",

Bisher gab es dar\u00FCber kaum Informationen. Und schon gar keine Bilder. Dem Mannheimer TV-Journalisten Peter Reichelt ist es gelungen, Besserungsanstalten, sogenannte RPF\u0027s (Rehabilitation Project Forces) des Scientology-Konzerns aufzusp\u00FCren.\nVon unserem Reporter ANTON NOTZ \nZwei Autostunden von Los Angeles entfernt, in einer w\u00FCsten\u00E4hnlichen Landschaft, liegt \u0022Happy Valley\u0022. David Miscavage, der Chef von Scientology, hat sich in der N\u00E4he ein ebenso luxuri\u00F6ses wie mysteri\u00F6ses Imperium erbauen lassen. Im \u0022Gl\u00FCcklichen Tal\u0022 jedoch geht es anders zu als im Club Med. Rund 100 Leute der Elite-Einheit Sea-Org m\u00FCssen hier b\u00FC\u00DFen. \u0022Die Menschen sind echte Gefangene. Sie sind absolut nicht freiwillig da\u0022, erz\u00E4hlt Gerry Armstrong, Ex-Koordinator des Scientology-Geheimdienstes OSA, der nach eigenen Angaben zweieinhalb Jahre in Straflagern verbrachte. \nJesse Prince, fr\u00FCher zweiter Mann in der Scientology-F\u00FChrung hinter Miscavage, erz\u00E4hlt Reichelt vor laufender Kamera, was hinter Stacheldraht und video\u00FCberwachten Mauern vor sich geht. Wie Sklaven m\u00FC\u00DFten die Camp-Internierten Tag und Nacht arbeiten. Auch Prince spricht aus eigener Erfahrung. Er ging durchs \u0022Gl\u00FCckliche Tal\u0022 wegen Befehlsverweigerung. \u0022Es war absolut f\u00FCrchterlich. Ich schlief in einem H\u00FChnerverschlag auf dem Boden, Klapperschlangen und Scorpione um mich herum.\u0022 Schwerstarbeit, Zwangshypnose, Gerhirnw\u00E4sche - das sind Aussteigern zufolge die Methoden, mit denen Scientology \u0022Zweifler und Versager\u0022 wieder auf Linie zu bringen versucht. Nicht alle, aber jene, die bedeutsam sind f\u00FCr die Organisation, weil sie zu viel wissen oder ein wichtiges Rad in der weltumspannenden Geldmaschinerie sind. \nWie man sich in einem Straflager in Kopenhagen rehabilitieren mu\u00DF, beschreibt eine einstmals hochrangige Scientologin so: Keine Zeitung, kein Radio, mit niemandem reden, den Abfall der anderen essen, immer arbeiten. Jeder beobachtet dabei jeden. Mit \u0022Wissensreporten\u0022 schw\u00E4rzt man die anderen an. Das kalifornische Straflager innerhalb von Miscavages goldenem K\u00E4fig kennt noch eine andere Besonderheit, die Peter Reichelt bei einem Flug \u00FCber das Areal entdeckt hat: den \u0022track\u0022. Jesse Prince erl\u00E4utert: Hier rennen manche \u0022Versager\u0022 zw\u00F6lf Stunden um einen Pfahl herum, um wieder anst\u00E4ndige Scientologen zu werden. \nPrince hat sich aus den F\u00E4ngen des Sekten-Konzerns befreit. Nach zahlreichen Morddrohungen lebt er getrennt von seiner Familie, um sie zu sch\u00FCtzen. Peter Reichelt und seine Kollegin Ina Brockmann, die w\u00E4hrend der Dreharbeiten von Scientology-Mitgliedern auf offener Stra\u00DFe gewaltsam festgehalten worden waren, haben inzwischen einen Film fertiggestellt, der heute um 22.45 Uhr in S\u00FCdwest 3 ausgestrahlt wird. \nNach wie vor im \u0022Gl\u00FCcklichen Tal\u0022 lebt die 51j\u00E4hrige Wiebke Hansen, in Hamburg zehn Jahre lang eine der erfolgreichsten Scientology-Managerinnen weltweit. 1995 verschwand sie spurlos, ihr Bruder Jochen K\u00F6rner hat nun wieder Kontakt zu ihr. In Hollywood konnte er sie vor kurzem einen Tag besuchen. Wiebke Hansen produziert Werbefilme f\u00FCr Scientology. Am Abend kehrte sie mehr oder weniger freiwillig ins \u0022Happy Valley\u0022 zur\u00FCck. \u0022Umerziehungslager, das hatten wir doch alles schon einmal\u0022, sagt Jochen K\u00F6rner ratlos. \nMedienkritik:\nFrankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\nvon Michael Hanfeld\n25.02.99 Feuilleton \nHubbards Lager\nScientology hautnah: \u0022Verschwunden im Happy Valley?\u0022 \nWibke H. war weit oben. Sie lenkte die Geschicke ihres Unternehmens in ganz Deutschland. In den ersten Jahren ihres Wirkens konnte sie der Zentrale in den Vereinigten Staaten stets steigende Ums\u00E4tze melden. Ihr j\u00E4her Fall nahte, als neue J\u00FCnger zunehmend ausblieben. Das trug ihr die Reise nach \u0022Happy Valley\u0022 ein, wo sie sich wohl noch heute befindet, und wo es, den Recherchen von Peter Reichelt und Ina Brockmann zufolge, wohl kaum sehr angenehm sein kann.
