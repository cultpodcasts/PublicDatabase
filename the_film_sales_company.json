      "description": "After graduating from college, young idealist Will Allen joined a spiritual community filled with like minded people looking for some answers to the basic questions of life, led by a charismatic but secretive guru.  Camera in hand, Allen documented 20 years of living inside this community, showing how his idealism began to unravel as more is revealed about the true nature of this cult. Speaking out publicly for the first time, and with unprecedented and unparalleled access, Holy Hell is a descent into a world no one, not even its participants, could have imagined.\n#independentfilm #documentarymovies #sundance #sundancefilmfestival #escaping #cult #cults",
