Well, if you assemble the ingredients for The People\u0027s Temple a bit differently you get Father Divine\u0027s cult. In part one of our deep dive into the man who changed the history of cults forever, Paige takes Mando and Andrea through the Civil War, Civil Rights, and several goofs along the way. So, join us and learn about the man who even Jim Jones tried to emulate. And remember: Don\u0027t Drink the Gatorade! (Welp, there goes that sponsorship.)",
