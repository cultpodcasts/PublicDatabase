      "description": "Doomsday cult leader Chad Daybell finally goes on trial for the murders of his wife, Tammy Daybell, and the children of his current wife, Lori Vallow Daybell. Lori was already found guilty of the murder of her children, Tylee and JJ, as well as Tammy Daybell. Chad and Lori were married only two weeks after Tammy\u2019s death, in an apparent scheme to rid themselves of everyone who got in the way of their happiness. Prosecutor Dave Aronberg, a/k/a the Florida Law Man, goes through the timeline of this tragedy and explains how justice has caught up with the doomsday couple. Lori received three life sentences and Chad is facing the death penalty in this Idaho trial. The big question is: Will Chad point the finger at Lori to save himself??",
