      "description": "In today\u2019s episode of Bite Back with Abbey Sharp, we get to sit down with ex-NXIVM cult member, Sarah Edmonson. Sarah is the star of the hit HBO series, The Vow, the author of Scarred, and the co-host of the podcast, A Little Bit Culty. In this episode, she details the extreme low calorie diets and exercise regimens that members of Keith Raniere\u2019s NXIVM cult were instructed to follow. We discuss the role of diet restriction in cults and control, how wellness MLM\u2019s use similar tactics as cults, and I will be leaving you with a list of red flags that your diet or wellness routine might actually be operating like a cult.
