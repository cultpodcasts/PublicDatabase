      "description": "This week\u2019s dilemma hits close to home. A listener\u2019s brother has thrown himself into a self-development program called Landmark, spending thousands and encouraging the rest of the family to do the same\u2014offering to even cover part of the cost. The catch? It\u2019s giving off major MLM and cult-like vibes.\n\nOur listener\u2019s sister has already signed up despite being unable to afford it, and the whole situation feels uncomfortable and coercive. In this episode, Victoria and Jess break down what Landmark actually is, why it\u2019s so controversial, and how to navigate the complex emotional dynamics when family is involved.\n\nWe unpack:\n\nWhat Landmark and other LGATs (Large Group Awareness Trainings) actually are\n\nThe red flags to look out for in these programs\n\nWhether Landmark is technically an MLM\u2014or something even more intense\n\nThe fine line between offering support and setting boundaries\n\nAdvice from the community, including past participants and those who\u2019ve tried to intervene\n\nThis one\u2019s a mix of real talk, financial caution, and emotional support\u2014because sometimes protecting your money means protecting your peace, even from those closest to you.\n\nHave you ever felt pressured to join something that didn\u2019t sit right with you?
