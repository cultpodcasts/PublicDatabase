      "description": "You may remember Bethany Joy Lenz from One Tree Hill (she was Haley James Scott on the show), but today she is being generous with her story of faith and freedom and identity, as she talks about the journey of finding herself in a cult, the manipulation she experienced, and the empowerment she found to break way from it all. She shares even more of this story and the destruction narcissism can cause in her brand new memoir, Dinner for Vampires , which, y\u2019all, I seriously couldn\u0027t put down. . . . .
