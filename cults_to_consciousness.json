      "description": "As a chiId, Michelle Dowd grew up on a mountain in the Angeles National Forest. She was born into an ultra-religious cult\u2014or the Field as they called it\u2014started in the 1930s by her grandfather, a mercurial, domineering, and charismatic man who convinced generations of young male followers that he would live 500 years and ascend to the heavens when doomsday came. Comfort and care are sins, Michelle is told. As a result, she was forced to learn the skills necessary to battle hunger, thirst, and cold; she learned to trust animals more than humans; and most importantly, she learned how to survive in the natural world.\n\u00A0\nAt the Field, a young Michelle lives a life of ab*se, poverty, and isolation, as she obeys her family\u2019s rigorous religious and patriarchal rules\u2014which are so extreme that Michelle is convinced her mother would sacrifice her, like Abraham and Isaac, if instructed by God. She often wears the same clothes for months at a time; she is often ill and always hungry for both love and food. She is taught not to trust Outsiders, and especially not Quitters, nor her own body and its warnings.\n\u00A0\nBut as Michelle gets older, she realizes she has the strength to break free. Focus on what will sustain, not satiate you, she tells herself. Use everything. Waste nothing. Get to know the intricacies of the land, like the intricacies of your body. And so she does.\n\u00A0\nUsing stories of individual edible plants and their uses to anchor each chapter, Forager is both a searing coming-of-age story and a meditation on the ways in which understanding nature can lead to freedom, even joy.\n\nFind Michelle:\n\nSubscribe to Substack\nPick up a copy of Forager: Field Notes for Surviving a Family Cult\u00A0\nhttps://www.instagram.com/michelledowdz/\nhttps://www.michelledowd.org/\n\n\nWe want to meet you in real life!

      "description": "Sosa Henkoma was 8 when he ran away from v*olence at home.  At 9 he was groomed by a gang in the UK, drawn into dr*g traff*cking while feeling abandoned in foster care.  He recounts the moment he had a shotg*n pointed to his head at 11 during a raid.  On this 12th birthday, just released from the hospital after being st*bbed, we has given his own shotg*n, and a bulletproof vest.  Trapped in a life of crime for the next decade, he ran g*ns and dr*gs between London and Liverpool, becoming known as \u201CThe Devil Walking on Earth\u201D.  \n\nSosa says said he counts himself lucky to still be alive after he was st*bbed at least 11 times and shot at twice.  It was only after Sosa was convicted and imprisoned that authorities deemed him to be a victim.  He describes how fatherhood, therapy and sheer luck saved him.\n\nFind Sosa on social media:\nwww.instagram.com/sosa_est\nwww.instagram.com/escaperoutes_uk/\nhttps://linktr.ee/sosa_est\n\nWe want to meet you in real life!

      "description": "Watch Part 1:  https://youtu.be/idrKmytaYdU?si=DCq0RJtPQXHnjuYW\n\nIn the early 2000s, after years of hard work and determination to break through as an actor, Bethany Joy Lenz was finally cast as one of the leads on the hit drama One Tree Hill. Her acting career was set to soar, but her personal life was beginning to unravel in ways her fans could never imagine. Unknown to the millions of viewers and even her costars, Lenz led a secret double life within a cult.\n\nAs an only chiId seeking belonging, Lenz thought she found a safe haven in a Bible study group with fellow Hollywood creatives. However, the group morphed into something more sinister\u2014a web of manipulation and fear under the guise of a church covenant called The Big House Family. Piece by piece, Lenz surrendered her autonomy, eventually moving to the Family\u2019s Pacific Northwest compound overseen by a domineering minister who convinced her to marry his son and secretly drained millions from her TV income without her knowledge. Family \u201Cminders\u201D assigned to her on set, \u201CMaoist struggle session\u201D\u2014inspired meetings in the basement of a filthy house, and regular counseling with \u201CLeadership\u201D were just part of the tactics used to keep her loyal.\n\nOnly when she became a mother did Lenz find the courage to escape and spare her chiId from a similar fate.

      "description": "In the early 2000s, after years of hard work and determination to break through as an actor, Bethany Joy Lenz was finally cast as one of the leads on the hit drama\u00A0One Tree Hill. Her acting career was set to soar, but her personal life was beginning to unravel in ways her fans could never imagine. Unknown to the millions of viewers and even her costars, Lenz led a secret double life within a cult.\n\nAs an only chiId seeking belonging, Lenz thought she found a safe haven in a Bible study group with fellow Hollywood creatives. However, the group morphed into something more sinister\u2014a web of manipulation and fear under the guise of a church covenant called The Big House Family. Piece by piece, Lenz surrendered her autonomy, eventually moving to the Family\u2019s Pacific Northwest compound overseen by a domineering minister who convinced her to marry his son and secretly drained millions from her TV income without her knowledge. Family \u201Cminders\u201D assigned to her on set, \u201CMaoist struggle session\u201D\u2014inspired meetings in the basement of a filthy house, and regular counseling with \u201CLeadership\u201D were just part of the tactics used to keep her loyal.\n\nOnly when she became a mother did Lenz find the courage to escape and spare her chiId from a similar fate. After nearly a decade (and with the unlikely help from a devoted\u00A0One Tree Hill\u00A0fan), she broke free from the family\u2019s grip, beginning her healing journey from deep trauma that reshaped her faith and identity.\n\nThe One Tree Hill\u00A0star opens up about everything in her New York Times\u00A0bestselling memoir, Dinner for Vampires.\n\nFind Bethany Joy Lenz \u0026 her book: \nwww.instagram.com/msbethanyjoylenz/\nhttps://linktr.ee/bethanyjoylenz\n\nWe want to meet you in real life!

Under it all, Magan was grappling with the reality that he was gay, in an extremely homophob*c household where gay people were seen as sub-human and worthless. Understanding that in Islam, it\u2019s written that gay men should be unalived by horrible means.

Rather than reporting the imam for the CSA, her family kept it a secret so it wouldn\u2019t affect the marriage prospects for Layla and their other chiIdren.

      "description": "Nazreen Bibi was born and raised in the UK in a Mirpuri Sunni Muslim household. During her childhood she was sent off to learn the verbatim account of the Quran, which included teachers who threat*ned v*olence and aggression using kitchen utensils and mullahs based in a semi.  Nazreen\u2019s parents insisted on putting a headscarf on her, and during her secondary school years she would take the scarf off during school hours and put it back on when school finished. \n\nOn her 16th birthday she had hopes of completing A levels and going to university however her parents had other plans.  Instead they travelled abroad to Pakistan, and Nazreen was married to her mother\u2019s cousin (her uncle), someone she knew nothing about.  She recalls asking her mother if she could say no and her answer was \u201Cno, your grandad gave his word\u201D and that was that.  Soon after her marriage, her mother told her that she was to do whatever her husband wanted and that if she refused s*x the devil would curse her all night. \n\nNazreen soon became pregnant and gave birth to her daughter at age 17. The following 12 years, Nazreen spent fighting for freedom, freedom to work, freedom to have phone and freedom to wear what she wanted to wear.  Fueled with anger at the end of her twelve-year marriage, she could see how religion and culture shaped her parents\u2019 choices and world view, and how the teachings of Islam demanded the total subjugation of women.  Nazreen\u2019s parents stopped talking to her after her divorce and so she rebuilt her life as a single parent.  Her experience only confirmed what she had now grown to accept in that Islam was designed by men for men. Divorced women were deemed as used goods, a women\u2019s identity and personhood reduced to her reproductive parts and womb. \n\nSince her divorce she\u2019s been actively engaged in local politics, completed her degree and runs her own business. Now an exMuslim, Nazreen recently has come out as an atheist, speaking out against the generational religious ab*se \n\nFind Nazreen on social media!\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@grumpymirpuri\n\nWe want to meet you in real life!

      "description": "Anneke Lucas was born in Belgium where, at the age of 6, she was sold by her mother to a s*x traff*cking p*dophile network for European elites.\nHer family\u2019s cleaning lady ab*sed and groomed her before colluding with a relative to pimp her out to the exclusive club for dr*g-fueled orgies. She would continue to be ab*sed and tortur*d as a s*x slave for years.  She had never gone to police with her claims because she was scared into silence after watching kids getting k*lled by sadistic members as a \u0022warning\u0022 to others.  \n\nAnneke Lucas survived some of the worst atrocities known to humankind before the age of 12.  After living in London, Paris and New York as a young adult, she moved to Los Angeles where she began therapy, yoga and meditation. Today, she is the founder and Executive Director of Liberation Prison Yoga, a non-profit organization based in New York.  Now an advocate for other survivors, Anneke openly speaks about her experience.  A story that truly emphasizes the power of hope, we dive into Anneke\u2019s story, and healing journey.\n\nFind and support Anneke:\nwebsite: https://annekelucas.com\nbook: https://annekelucas.com/book\ninstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/anneke.lucas/\n\nWe want to meet you in real life!

Kidn*pped from Lydia\u2019s father by her mother at 2 years old, she was told he was always searching for her so he could continue his Satanic practices. \r\n\r\nNot only was Lydia dealing with these imposed traumas, she was told if she ever broke the rules of Mormonism or told someone about her past, her whole family would be tracked down by the Satanists and k*lled.

She was born as a chiId celebrity in the notorious The Children of God cult, known for their extreme ab*se practices of polygamy, pedoph*lia, forced chiId marriages, religious prost*tution, and chiId traff*cking.  Daughter to Sara Kelley\u2014 part of leadership, and writer of \u201CThe Davidito Book\u201D(CSA manuscript)\u2014 when Serena left the compound she continued to lie about who she was.  As she had been brainwashed to lie, it was hard for her to track when she should tell the truth, which created a warped sense of identity. \n\nSerena describes how she worked her way back into the cult to retrieve a boy that she liked, what it was like escaping for a second time, and what it was like being out in the world, on her own, free to do whatever she wanted for the first time.  Going from the s*x cult to now a fully s*xually charged environment in a club, she explains her methods at the time of processing the horrific things she went through as a child, involving a numbing with dr*g use, and dancing away the trauma.\n\nSerena also recounts what it was like when just months before his murd*r-suic*de, an adult Ricky Rodriguez, whom \u201CThe Davidito Book\u0022 was written about, contacted her wanting to know where the author (her mother) was.  \n\nSerena reveals her journey with healing from the trauma, dealing with ill-equipped therapists, to ultimately finding plant medicine.  Serena is now a writer and Trauma Recovery Specialist, helping others heal past traumas using methods to connect the mind, body, and soul to find peace and purpose in life.\n\n\nWatch pt 1 of Serena\u2019s interview:  https://youtu.be/MeQDwb4_YY4?si=Kex82p3AFhOz3uGQ\n\nFind Serena:\n\nIG:  https://www.instagram.com/serkelley/\nsubstack: https://substack.com/@serenakelley\nYT:  https://www.youtube.com/@serkelley\nwebsite: https://serenakelley.com/\n\n\nSubscribe to our C2C \u0022CLIPS\u0022 Channel! https://www.youtube.com/@CultstoConsciousnessClips\n\nSupport C2C - Any donations are welcome and appreciated to support the making of this podcast.\n\nFind our FULL (uncensored) merch store here!\nhttps://cults-to-consciousness-shop.fourthwall.com/en-usd\n\nPatreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/cultstoconsciousness\n\nVenmo @sheliseann\n\nWe want to meet you in real life!

      "description": "CW:  CSA, SA, ChiId Traff*cking\n\nDavid Brandt Berg also known as\u00A0King David,\u00A0Dad, or\u00A0Grandpa\u00A0to followers, was the founder and leader of the cult generally known as the ChiIdren of God.  In 1968 it began as a new religious movement focused on spreading the Christian message.  As the decades progressed, the group targeted vulnerable people, and devolved as a counter to purity culture in which Berg pushed the idea that God is love, and love is s*x, therefore members should have s*x with any one.  COG attracted the attention of the international media and a British court case would find the group to be an authoritarian\u00A0cult which engaged in the systematic\u00A0physical and s*xual ab*se\u00A0of chiIdren, resulting in lasting trauma among survivors. \n\nToday\u2019s guest, Serena Kelley, was born and raised in the cult, and along with her mother, Sara, were two of the select few people in David Berg\u2019s inner circle.  When Ricky Rodriguez (another chiId within the cult) was ten months old, Berg asked Sara, one of Ricky\u0027s nannies, to start creating a document titled \u0022The Davidito Book\u0022 (also referred to as \u0022The Story of Davidito\u0022). The book contains descriptions of adults CSA-ing Rodriguez, describing this ab*se in a \u0022celebratory\u0022 tone.  Serena\u2019s mother would end of writing the horrific CSA handbook for the Children of God Cult, and was even proud of the fact, becoming known as \u201CSara Davidito\u201D.  \n\nSerena recounts what it was like growing up in the cult, alongside her brainwashed mother, facing constant mental, physical and s*xual abuse, while being forced to appear in CSA videos, and how at the age of 3, Serena was \u201Cgiven\u201D to Berg as a chiId bride and told she was going to be his forever.  \n\nThis is her story.\n\nFind Serena:\nIG:  https://www.instagram.com/serkelley/\nsubstack: https://substack.com/@serenakelley\nYT:  https://www.youtube.com/@serkelley\nwebsite: https://serenakelley.com/\n\nSubscribe to our C2C \u0022CLIPS\u0022 Channel! https://www.youtube.com/@CultstoConsciousnessClips\n\nSupport C2C - Any donations are welcome and appreciated to support the making of this podcast.\n\nFind our FULL (uncensored) merch store here!\nhttps://cults-to-consciousness-shop.fourthwall.com/en-usd\n\nPatreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/cultstoconsciousness\n\nVenmo @sheliseann\n\nWe want to meet you in real life!

When comedy clubs/restaurants were forced to ban her from performing, she took to social media and went viral.

      "description": "Following up her incredible interview recounting how she grew up in a religious community-turned-cult called the Center, today Patricia Walsh Chadwick joins us live to discuss what happened after.\r\n\r\nAt the age of seventeen she was forced out of her home, leaving behind her entire family, and without access to higher education. From her first job as a receptionist at a brokerage firm, she clawed her way up the ladder\u2014rung by rung\u2014in that bastion of male chauvinism: Wall Street. By going to college at night, she achieved her degree in economics from Boston University, and from there, she headed to New York City. With a drive that earned her the moniker \u201CWitch of Wall Street,\u201D she rose from the ranks of research analyst to portfolio manager, where she was responsible for billions of dollars in pension and endowment assets. A turning point in her life was giving birth to twins at the age of forty-five, and she continued forward in her career, becoming a global partner at Invesco. At the turn of the millennium, she left Wall Street behind and embarked on a second career as a corporate board director.\r\n\r\nWatch her initial interview here:  https://youtu.be/L36uYaBR7Ww?si=68e6mNqyqgLp_eAZ\r\n\r\nConnect with Patricia on social media: \r\nWebsite:  https://www.patriciachadwick.com/\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/patriciachadwickauthor\r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/patriciachadwick1/\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/patriciawalshchadwick/\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@patriciachadwick6951\r\n\r\nSubscribe to our C2C \u0022CLIPS\u0022 Channel! https://www.youtube.com/@CultstoConsciousnessClips\r\n\r\nSupport C2C - Any donations are welcome and appreciated to support the making of this podcast.\r\n\r\nFind our FULL (uncensored) merch store here!\r\nhttps://cults-to-consciousness-shop.fourthwall.com/en-usd\r\n\r\nPatreon\r\nhttps://www.patreon.com/cultstoconsciousness\r\n\r\nVenmo @sheliseann\r\n\r\nWe want to meet you in real life!

      "description": "From the age of six through her high school years, Patricia Walsh Chadwick was raised in The Center, an isolated, rural community of 100 members, including 39 children, led by Father Leonard Feeney, an excommunicated Jesuit priest, and managed with an iron fist by his spiritual alter ego, Catherine Clarke. Together, they created a monastic environment that demanded obedience, silence, chastity, and detachment from family, achieved by separating parents from their children and forbidding members to read newspapers, watch television, listen to the radio, or communicate with outsiders.  Patricia defied Sister Catherine\u2019s mission to mold her into a compliant, submissive nun. At 17, in the middle of the turbulent 1960s, she was expelled from her home in Still River, Massachusetts, without a hint of how to survive, much less thrive, in an unfamiliar and frightening world.  \n\nToday, Patricia has had a successful 30-year career in the investment business, culminating as a Global Partner at Invesco, as she he sits on a number of corporate boards and blogs on economic, social, and political issues.

      "description": "Zara Kay went viral when she was wrongfully arrested and detained for seemingly no reason. She tweeted that she needed help and since becoming an Australian citizen, she got the consulate involved. It appears that the Tanzanian, Islamic cult she grew up in, was unhappy with her outspoken (contradictory to teachings) opinions on social media and seems to have paid the Tanzanian police to arrest her while visiting home during the pandemic in 2020. No formal charges were made after ransacking her home and detaining her for hours. Soon after her release, personal information and messages were leaked to the public, her family and her received multiple death threats. She now runs The Faithless Hijabi where she provides support for ex Muslims. \n\nFind Zara on social media: \nIG: https://www.instagram.com/zarakayk/\nYT: https://www.youtube.com/@ZaraKayk (The Untethered Mind)\nWebsite:  https://www.faithlesshijabi.org/\n\nSubscribe to our C2C \u0022CLIPS\u0022 Channel! https://www.youtube.com/@CultstoConsciousnessClips\n\nSupport C2C - Any donations are welcome and appreciated to support the making of this podcast.\n\nFind our FULL (uncensored) merch store here!\nhttps://cults-to-consciousness-shop.fourthwall.com/en-usd\n\nPatreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/cultstoconsciousness\n\nVenmo @sheliseann\n\n**FULLY BOOKED** Our C2C vacation where we can meet you in real life and go on adventures together has sold out!

      "description": "Born into this hyper-strict cult in Wisconsin, Martha Glory Stecker Kartaoui was told she was one of the chosen people. Intense modesty rules and odd dietary restrictions were nothing compared to what she endured every weekend at the compound with her family. Groomed by the leader himself, Martha was chosen to move to the compound where she would be psychologically, emotionally, spiritually and physically tortured for 8 years until she could escape his tight grasp. \n\nNow, Martha is a certified life/health coach, spiritual mentor specializing in trauma. She\u2019s an Amazon Best Selling International Author, a dynamic speaker, and a skilled healing facilitator. As a cult survivor, she finds purpose and passion in leading healing retreats/workshops for others who have survived Cults or other high-controlled groups and their communities. Because she knows intimately the challenges of reclaiming one\u0027s identity outside the constraints of the cult culture, she\u2019s dedicated to assisting individuals seeking to reclaim their lives in order to thrive in their own journey towards self-discovery and divine fulfillment.\n\nMartha is building a platform (Cult-X) for those interested in connecting in a safe space to share experiences and find healing. Cult-X is a hub for resources, community, workshop/retreat opportunities, and group sharing.

Determined to find a loving community coupled with a thirst for spirituality and religion, she ended up joining the local Mennonite church. She later discovered that 2 men who had been her clients as a child, were part of this church. When she confronted leaders about their behaviors, now understanding their actions were wrong, she was told that she was not to be believed because she was not a baptized member yet. This was only the beginning of how she was tossed around as \u201Cdamaged\u201D or \u201Cpromiscuous\u201D between countless settlements and treated like property.

With some of her children already adults, she snuck out with the youngest 4 who were still very young.

After years of custody battles, she kept access to her kids, but the court ordered one son stay in a Hasidic school which gave him no secular education.

She was groomed to be a stay at home wife and mother, with so much emphasis placed on virtue and virginity. When she was ass*ulted at 14, she was told to repent and read a book authored by a high LDS authority which said she would be better off dead than without her virtue. When she didn\u2019t succeed, she gave her life even more to the church and when leaders, years later, told her to marry a man/stranger who had also just taken advantage of her, she called off her engagement to the love of her life and complied. Though devout and active members of the church, her parents were not allowed to attend her temple wedding due to extreme poverty making them unable to pay tithing. \n\nFind Jennie!\nTikTok @lifetaketwo https://www.tiktok.com/@lifetaketwo?_t=8oifKuMyiQY\u0026_r=1\nIG @lifetaketwojennie https://www.instagram.com/lifetaketwojennie?igsh=MWQ1ZGUxMzBkMA==\nYouTube @lifetaketwo7662 https://m.youtube.com/@lifetaketwo7662\nLinktree https://linktr.ee/lifetaketwo\n\nSubscribe to our C2C \u0022CLIPS\u0022 Channel! https://www.youtube.com/@CultstoConsciousnessClips\n\nSupport C2C - Any donations are welcome and appreciated to support the making of this podcast.\n\nFind our FULL (uncensored) merch store here!\nhttps://cults-to-consciousness-shop.fourthwall.com/en-usd\n\nPatreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/cultstoconsciousness\n\nVenmo @sheliseann\n\n**FULLY BOOKED** Our C2C vacation where we can meet you in real life and go on adventures together has sold out!

As Joe grew up, his dating life was non existent, and he felt \u201Cbehind\u201D.  It became evident that only a small portion of the men were having all of the wives, and that not all of the men would be married.  What made it more difficult was that if Joe wanted to \u201Ccome forward\u201D on a girl, he had to go through Daniel, and also the Prophet, who arranged the cult\u2019s marriages.  Things came to a head for Joe at 18, when his mother became sick with cancer and Daniel prescribed his own method to help her heal\u2014 fasting, as a way to \u201Cstarve the cancer\u201D, which Joe felt he couldn\u2019t go against.  When his mother died, he decided to leave the cult.  The only thing stopping Joe from starting over was The Order having control of his bank account.  \n\nResource for those escaping polygamy:\nhttps://holdingouthelp.org/\n\nJoe\u2019s Magic Music Show with Mayce:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jBPdLV1lQc\u0026t=88s\n\nFind Joe on social media:\n\nIG:  @johnjosephrobinson\nhttps://www.instagram.com/johnjosephrobinson\nYT:  https://www.youtube.com/@MagicPranksJohn\n\nSubscribe to our C2C \u0022CLIPS\u0022 Channel! https://www.youtube.com/@CultstoConsciousnessClips\n\nSupport C2C - Any donations are welcome and appreciated to support the making of this podcast.\n\nFind our FULL (uncensored) merch store here!\nhttps://cults-to-consciousness-shop.fourthwall.com/en-usd\n\nPatreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/cultstoconsciousness\n\nVenmo @sheliseann\n\n**FULLY BOOKED** Our C2C vacation where we can meet you in real life and go on adventures together has sold out!

One of the most sacred tenants of The Order, a fundamentalist polygamous break of sect of the mainstream mormon/LDS church, is living polygamy. Nephi knew he was gay, but hid it most of his life because living authentically was never an option for him. He was essentially assigned a wife at a young age and had 7 children before he realized he couldn\u2019t pretend anymore. His father, who had 14 wives and over 160 children was pushing him to take another wife, so he came out to him. Nephi was told he was gay for various reasons such as eating too much chicken and he needed to stay faithful lest he go to the depths of Hell.

After being kicked out for kissing a boy, forced to do free labor and write an apology letter to his parents, she finally reconnected with her love.

Having spent his childhood homeschooled by his mother, at 12, his parents decided to incorporate Bill Gothard\u2019s practices into his education.  As a form of pun*shment for having a girlfriend, at 16, Davey was sent to an intense IBLP training center.  Instead of correcting his \u201Cbad\u201D behavior, Davey further rebelled, which ultimately led him to spend 7 days in the Prayer Room, the center\u2019s solitary confinement, which only had a bible.  Davey recounts his losing-touch-with-reality experience, his attempts at escape, and now, all of these years later, going back to the center where the source of his decades of living with trauma began.

      "description": "As the 13th wife of FLDS leader Warren Jeffs, Ada Marie was extremely devout in her faith and belief in her prophet and husband. Even from prison, the entire church population was conditioned to believe he was innocent and persecuted by the government. However, as the years went on, Ada explains how his prophesies and commandments would get more and more odd and demanding. He would continue splitting up families, send people all over different states, disfellowship, then re-baptize and for some, completely cut them off. Ada was sent away for what was supposed to be 10 months. Five years later, she realized even if he allowed her back home, she wouldn\u2019t go. This is the slow process of how she deconstructed from the fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.\n\nWatch pt. 1 of Ada\u0027s interview here:  https://youtu.be/oPyXxqmL5oU?si=11Khmq2pesIDzYil\n\nConnect with Ada!\nIG: @adadraper1 https://www.instagram.com/adadraper1\nFB: Ada Draper https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100071254717945\n\nSupport Shelise\nAny donations are welcome and appreciated to support the making of this podcast\n\n**FULLY BOOKED** Our C2C vacation where we can meet you in real life and go on adventures together has sold out!

He claims that God commanded him to take dozens of wives, some of whom were as young as 12 years old. In his enormous temple/compound that his members built in Texas, he conducted what he called \u201Cheavenly sessions\u201D which were essentially big orgies with his wives, which he taped. Ultimately, his disturbing records is what got him put into prison, but he continues to send revelations, which get more and more outlandish, to his faithful members on the outside. \n\nConnect with Ada!\nIG: @adadraper1 https://www.instagram.com/adadraper1\nFB: Ada Draper https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100071254717945\nSupport Shelise\nAny donations are welcome and appreciated to support the making of this podcast\n\n**FULLY BOOKED** Our C2C vacation where we can meet you in real life and go on adventures together has sold out!

Having appeared in the Amazon docu-series,\u00A0Shiny Happy People, and written a harrowing memoir, A Well-Trained Wife\u00A0she reveals how she had to save herself and her family and details the ways that extreme views can manifest in a marriage.\n\nRecruited into the fundamentalist Quiverfull movement as a young wife, Tia Levings learned that being a good Christian meant following a list of additional life principles\u2013\u2013a series of secret, special rules to obey. Being a godly and submissive wife in Christian Patriarchy included strict discipline, isolation, and an alternative lifestyle that appeared wholesome to outsiders. Women were to be silent, \u201Ckeepers of the home.\u201D\n\nTia knew that to their neighbors her family was strange, but she also couldn\u0027t risk exposing their secret lifestyle to police, doctors, teachers, or anyone outside of their church. Christians were called in scripture to be \u201Cin the world, not of it.\u201D So, she hid in plain sight as years of abuse and pain followed. When Tia realized she was the only one who could protect her children from becoming the next generation of patriarchal men and submissive women, she began to resist and question how they lived. But in the patriarchy, a woman with opinions is in danger, and eventually, Tia faced an urgent and extreme choice: stay and face dire consequences, or flee with her children.\n\nPre order Tia\u2019s book: A Well-Trained Wife\nwww.tialevings.com\n\nFind Tia on social media!\nIG:  @tialevingswriter\nwww.instagram.com/tialevingswriter\n\nhttps://substack.com/@tialevings\nThe Anti-Fundamentalist\n\nOur C2C vacation where we can meet you in real life and go on adventures together has 3 spots left!

She was told he would even make the biggest decision of her life for her\u2014 who she was going to marry. She was gr**med to be a submissive wife under the patriarchy movement and stay-at-home daughters movement. Her homeschooling was completely unregulated and not much attention was paid to her education, because her sole purpose was to be a mother who eventually belonged to her husband. Terrified that anything less than strict obedience would land her in the fiery depths of Hell, she felt she had no choice but to go along with it well into her 20s.

      "description": "The Mormon church has always claimed to be accepting of everyone including the LGBTQ\u002B community. However, their actions and words spoken to the congregations paint a very different picture. You can be gay, but in order to receive all the blessings from God, you must remain celibate. It has come to our attention that in some wards (congregations), openly married gay couples have not only been able to keep their membership (rather than be excommunicated), but are allowed to take the sacrament and even hold important positions in the church. \r\n\r\nJoined by Dillan, who was recently featured on Jubilee\u2019s Middleground \u201CMormons vs Ex-Mormons\u201D, and @nuancehoe , we discuss these monumental changes in the right direction. \r\n\r\nAfter the live, you will be automatically redirected to another live stream on Carah\u2019s channel to hear more of Dillan\u2019s story:  https://www.youtube.com/live/tRYIIyI7fIE?si=OeCtP8XmRJltoPtJ\n\r\n\n\nFind Dillan\u0027s recent appearance on Jubliee\u0027s \u0022Can Mormons and Ex Mormons See Eye to Eye? | Middle Ground\u0022 video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Run1f29po8g\u0026rco=1\n\nCheck out Nuancehoe\u0027s reaction to Jublilee\u0027s video:\nMormons BOMB In Cringeworthy Debate | ExMo Jubilee Reaction\nhttps://youtu.be/ubja03yeDQc?si=ZKmpgt31yuxxSfz3\n\nCheck out Mormon Stories\u0027 reaction to Jubliee\u0027s video:\n\u0022Jubilee\u0027s \u201CMormons vs Ex-Mormons\u201D on Middle Ground - Ex-Mormon Cast Reacts | Ep. 186\u0022\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohJ4RSQJBzU\n\r\nMormon Stories Episode further expanding on the topic: \r\nMarried Gay Mormons Get Sacrament and Callings\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/DN4zFTCQL5w?si=CojKiUe_RdBWqsuB\r\n\r\nFind Nuancehoe \r\nYT @nuancehoe\r\nIG https://www.instagram.com/nuancehoe/\n\nOur C2C vacation where we can meet you in real life and go on adventures together has 6 spots left!

      "description": "Ben John: \u0022As a beginner entrepreneur/business owner in 2019, I was introduced to a book by Grant Cardone(The 10X Rule) that lured me into mentorship from him. After 3.5 years and $250k spent with Grant \u0026 his organization, I realized that I had ignored all the signs in that environment that encouraged me to idolize Grant as a God, seek him for success, disconnect with those who don\u2019t align with him or me, chase money, deceive, \u0026 manipulate others to get what I want. I later found that Grant is being operated by the church of Scientology and after looking into that myself, it made sense why he treats people badly \u0026 why he teaches entrepreneurs to unethically scale their business. I have been publicly speaking about this consistently so that people can be aware of not only Grant, but ALL self serving entrepreneurs who prey on people\u2019s fears to manipulate them \u0026 teach them how to deceive others. I\u2019ve done it regularly on my instagram/FB page, Instagram lives, \u0026 interviews.\u0022 Links to Ben\u2019s book, \u201CMisguided Mentor\u201D and businesses on his instagram page IG: @benjaminjohnmic FB: Ben\u2019s Massive Impact Our C2C vacation where we can meet you in real life and go on adventures together has 5 spots left!

      "description": "Celia was a daughter of the cult leader Ervil LeBaron, who practiced a fundamentalist Mormon teaching called Blood Atonement which meant taking lives in the name of God. Things got even more out of control when he was put in prison for his crimes and a hit list he created was beginning to be carried out by some of his younger followers. Thankfully, the practice of blood atonement, by way of the LeBarons has been disavowed today, but the effects of these tragic teachings still linger in the lives of those who were affected by it.

The women who are often assigned and married off at a young age, are forced to bear as many children as possible. Warren took it upon himself to separate mothers and fathers from their children at astonishing rates. We will discuss with Ceci Hendrickson (a former polygamist wife and mother) all of the ways they suffered in the FLDS. \r\n\r\nWatch her full episode here: \r\nhttps://youtu.be/rHwJhPrXpYg\r\n\r\nFind Ceci on Social!\r\nIG: @Ceci.Hendrickson\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ceci.hendrickson/\r\nClothing Line: https://pinkvalor.com/\r\nIG @pinkvalor\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/pinkvalor/\r\n\r\nOur C2C vacation where we can meet you in real life and go on adventures together has 7 spots left!

      "description": "Born and raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Katie\u0027s home life was less than perfect.  However, her parents remained very loyal to the teachings and the gospel of the LDS Church.  After years of SA from an older brother, Katie\u0027s sister reported it to the Bishop during a confession.  The Bishop advised to keep it a secret from everyone, including her parents, as the shame the perpetrator would have faced being forced to come home early from his LDS mission would have been, in his opinion, too great.  Due to this negligence more CSA circulated through their immediate family amongst the siblings, including Katie.  \n\nThe fundraiser for \u0022Darkness to Light\u0022 is currently being approved by YouTube.
