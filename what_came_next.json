      "description": " *Content warning: This episode includes discussion of coercive control, cults, cultic abuse, branding, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, rape, \u0026 sex slavery.  Sarah Edmondson is an actor, author, podcaster, victim advocate, \u0026 mother who has appeared in many publications and productions, including HBO\u2019s The Vow. She found her passion for the performing arts at a young age, and has seen great success in front of the camera. Her roles in front of them have drastically shifted over the last decade though; she now uses the spotlight to share her experiences in NXIVM. Sarah was tested to her limits by her journey within the multi-level marketing sex cult, and we are so grateful she was willing to talk to us about how she\u2019s turned what came next for her into education for the masses.
