      "title": "Epstein Files: Ex-Prince Andrew Arrested | Bill Gates Skips Delhi AI Summit | Rift In INDIA Bloc?",
      "description": "The global fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein files has reached a historic turning point with the arrest of former British royal Prince Andrew by Thames Valley Police on charges of misconduct in public office. The arrest, described as a \u0027seismic moment\u0027 in modern history, follows revelations of his alleged ties to the late sex offender. Simultaneously, the scandal has impacted high-profile events in India, where Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates withdrew from a scheduled keynote address at the India AI Impact Summit in Delhi. The transcript highlights a \u0027reckoning for the global elite,\u0027 noting high-level resignations across the US, UAE, and Europe, including DP World CEO Sultan Ahmed bin Salaim and Goldman Sachs Chief Legal Officer Kathy Romer. In India, the files have brought scrutiny to Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri and industrialist Anil Ambani regarding their past interactions with Epstein. While no legal culpability has been established for the Indian figures, the report questions the \u0027code of silence\u0027 surrounding their mentions in the documents. \n\n #PrinceAndrewArrest #EpsteinFiles #INDIABloc #BillGates #HardeepPuri #AnilAmbani #GlobalReckoning #BreakingNews #IndiaToday #RoyalScandal #JeffreyEpstein #AISummit #DelhiNews #KingCharles #KeirStarmer #Justice \n\n \nSubscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you\u0027ll never miss a new video.\n\nAll you need to do is PRESS THE BELL ICON next to the Subscribe button!\n\nIndia Today TV is India\u0027s leading English News Channel.

      "description": "Former BBC Editor Naresh Kaushik joins India Today\u0027s \u0027Five Live\u0027 to discuss the \u0027unprecedented\u0027 arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew. UK police took the royal into custody on 19 February 2026, at the Sandringham estate. Unlike previous allegations, this arrest stems from suspected \u0027misconduct in public office\u0027 related to sharing sensitive government data with Jeffrey Epstein during his tenure as a trade envoy. Kaushik describes the event as a \u0027stark\u0027 fall from grace for King Charles\u0027 brother, noting the Royal Family is under immense pressure. The discussion highlights that Andrew is being treated as a \u0027regular civilian\u0027 following the stripping of his royal titles. The segment also connects the global fallout of the Epstein files to India, noting Bill Gates\u0027 last-minute withdrawal from the India AI Impact Summit after his name featured in the documents. Kaushik suggests this arrest may be the \u0027tip of the iceberg\u0027, with other high-profile figures like Peter Mandelson potentially facing scrutiny. \n\n #PrinceAndrewArrested #EpsteinFiles #EpsteinScandal #itwebvideos #UKNews #RoyalFamily #KingCharles #NareshKaushik #FiveLive #IndiaToday #BreakingNews #BillGates #KeirStarmer #Sandringham #Justice #GlobalNews \n\n \nSubscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you\u0027ll never miss a new video.\n\nAll you need to do is PRESS THE BELL ICON next to the Subscribe button!\n\nIndia Today TV is India\u0027s leading English News Channel.

      "description": "In an exclusive interview with India Today, Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri lashed out at Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi, describing his conduct in Parliament as \u0027buffoonery\u0027 and \u0027politics by innuendo\u0027. Addressing allegations regarding his name appearing in the Jeffrey Epstein files, Puri clarified that his brief interactions with Epstein occurred between 2013 and 2014 as part of an official delegation for the Independent Commission on Multilateralism (ICM). He stated, \u0027I did not meet him on my own volition; I went to him as part of my work.\u0027 Puri revealed he had sent a detailed note to Gandhi in November 2025 explaining these facts after a \u0027winking\u0027 encounter in Parliament, yet the Congress leader chose to raise the issue on the floor. The Minister further defended India\u0027s trade deals, dismissing claims of \u0027surrender\u0027 to the US as nonsensical. He also addressed past social media attacks by TMC MP Mahua Moitra, suggesting that those attempting to \u0027milk\u0027 the controversy would face \u0027systemic retribution\u0027. \n\n #HardeepSinghPuri #RahulGandhi #EpsteinFiles #IndiaToday #IndianPolitics #Parliament #BJP #Congress #Exclusive #PoliticalNews #HardeepPuri #MahuaMoitra #TradeDeal #IndiaGrowth #BreakingNews \n\n \nSubscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you\u0027ll never miss a new video.\n\nAll you need to do is PRESS THE BELL ICON next to the Subscribe button!\n\nIndia Today TV is India\u0027s leading English News Channel.

      "description": "Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi launched a scathing attack on the government during the Budget debate in the Lok Sabha, alleging that the Prime Minister has \u0027sold India\u0027 because he is being \u0027choked\u0027 by powerful interests. Gandhi specifically targeted businessman Gautam Adani, claiming that the ongoing legal case in the United States is actually \u0027targeted to the Prime Minister of India\u0027 and the BJP\u0027s financial architecture. He further stirred controversy by mentioning the \u0027Epstein files\u0027, questioning why certain individuals are not in jail and asking who introduced them to Jeffrey Epstein. The speech faced heavy interruptions from the Chair and BJP\u0027s Ravi Shankar Prasad, who cited Rule 352 and 353, arguing that Gandhi was making \u0027wild allegations\u0027 against high authorities and ministers without substantive motions or prior notice. Gandhi also took a personal swipe at the presiding officer, calling him an \u0027ex-Congress member\u0027 whose \u0027heart is still here\u0027, while maintaining that the defense budget is being influenced by corporate interests. \n\n #RahulGandhi #LokSabha #Budget2026 #itwebvideos #Adani #EpsteinFiles #Parliament #IndianPolitics #BJP #Congress #PMModi #DefenseBudget #RaviShankarPrasad #Opposition #IndiaToday #PoliticalNews \n\n \nSubscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you\u0027ll never miss a new video.\n\nAll you need to do is PRESS THE BELL ICON next to the Subscribe button!\n\nIndia Today TV is India\u0027s leading English News Channel.

      "description": "On this Special Report, the focus is on the controversy surrounding US President Donald Trump and the unreleased Jeffrey Epstein files. Despite a 2024 campaign promise to release all documents, Trump has faced criticism from his own supporters for the delay. The programme highlights a damning Wall Street Journal report alleging a leaked birthday message from Trump to Epstein, which Trump has denied, reportedly filing a $10 billion libel suit in response. Addressing the fascination with the case, Trump stated, \u0027He\u0027s dead for a long time. He was never a big factor in terms of life...
