      "description": "On this Special Report, the focus is on the controversy surrounding US President Donald Trump and the unreleased Jeffrey Epstein files. Despite a 2024 campaign promise to release all documents, Trump has faced criticism from his own supporters for the delay. The programme highlights a damning Wall Street Journal report alleging a leaked birthday message from Trump to Epstein, which Trump has denied, reportedly filing a $10 billion libel suit in response. Addressing the fascination with the case, Trump stated, \u0027He\u0027s dead for a long time. He was never a big factor in terms of life... It\u0027s pretty boring stuff.\u0027 \n\n #DonaldTrump #JeffreyEpstein #EpsteinFiles #itwebvideos  #MAGA #USPolitics #WallStreetJournal #Lawsuit #PrinceAndrew #BillClinton #IndiaToday #SpecialReport #ViralVideo #NewsUpdate #TruthSocial #Justice \n\n \nSubscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you\u0027ll never miss a new video.\n\nAll you need to do is PRESS THE BELL ICON next to the Subscribe button!\n\nIndia Today TV is India\u0027s leading English News Channel.
