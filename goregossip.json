      "description": "There\u2019s an area of society that\u2019s shrouded in layers of darkness and mystery. An area that hides behind fake smiles, promises of \u201Cenlightment\u201D, and a false sense of community. Today we\u2019re talking\u2026. Cults. Cults have always fascinated me and I might make this a recurring series. There are some cults I probably won\u2019t touch with a 10 foot pole. Like one that\u2019s always in the news, there was a show about survivors and tons of celebrities are a part of. But there\u2019s plenty we can talk about besides them.\n\n00:00:00 Introduction to Cults\n00:03:00 The People\u0027s Temple and Jim Jones\n00:09:00 Heaven\u0027s Gate and Spiritual Transcendence\n00:15:00 Digital Cults and Modern Manipulation\n00:21:00 Conclusion and Reflections",
