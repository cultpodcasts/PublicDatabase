      "description": "In this episode, we dive into the complicated relationship between churches and interpersonal violence\u2014both when they contribute to the problem and when they try to help. First, we break down how religious leadership can sometimes follow a high-control \u2018playbook\u2019 that keeps people trapped in harmful cycles. Then, Aleesa unpacks what it looks like when churches actually step up to address these issues. We explore why prioritizing victim safety and sharing accurate information matters way more than churches trying to handle abuse without the right expertise.",

Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re bringing our cult radar along for the ride, too. And in predictable form there\u0027s some places where the model is less academic/psychology and more opportunistic \u0022guru bro\u0022 MLM vibe. Nonetheless if you\u2019ve got even 1/100th of Jennifer\u2019s enthusiasm for psychology talk, you\u2019re in for a treat.
