      "description": "Today, Jennifer is taking Aleesa (and all of you) on a deep dive into Spiral Dynamics\u2014a rainbow-colored model for understanding human development, both individually and collectively. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re bringing our cult radar along for the ride, too. And in predictable form there\u0027s some places where the model is less academic/psychology and more opportunistic \u0022guru bro\u0022 MLM vibe. Nonetheless if you\u2019ve got even 1/100th of Jennifer\u2019s enthusiasm for psychology talk, you\u2019re in for a treat. And if this episode leaves you wanting more, check out Rob Bell\u0027s 4 Part Series \u0022Me We Everybody\u0022 at https://open.spotify.com/episode/7IB6jHlfPM8d0rMmtE9v0k?si=2b7bfa25b5294ed3 or the book Spiral Dynamics by Beck and Cowan.",
