      "description": "We look at a number of Cults that are operating in Ireland, including \u0027The House of Prayer\u0027, \u0027Palmarians\u0027 and \u0027Scientologists\u0027\n\nWe speak with ex Scientology members as they blow the lid on one of the most famous cults of all time!\n\n \u0027Exposed: Ireland\u0027s Secret Cults\u0027 airs Tonight Monday 26th September, 2011 at 9pm on TV3\n\n\u0027Exposed: Ireland\u0027s Secret Cults!\u0027 takes a close look at a number of cults operating right here in Ireland.\n\nThe first of these cults is Christiana Gallagher\u0027s House of Prayer in Achill Co. Mayo. We go undercover to examine the source of her seemingly lavish life style and look at the credibility of some of her \u0022God given\u0022 predictions about the future of the world, as well as those running \u0027The House of Prayer\u0027 in her name.\n\nAlso exposed in the documentary is perhaps the most famous cult of all, \u0027Scientology\u0027! We look at their methods of extracting money from new recruits and how they manage to keep members loyal to the cult. We also speak to ex members who have worked within \u0027Scientology\u0027 itself and find out what attracts the likes of Tom Cruise to join such a cult!\n\nFinally, we expose perhaps the most mysterious of them all the \u0027Palmarians\u0027. \u0027Palmarians\u0027 originate in Spain but attract a large number of followers here in Ireland! We look at the cult\u0027s wealth and very strict rule set that can separate children from their parents.",
