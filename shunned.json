      "description": "Through gaslighting, one person or one group of people can become the reality check for an individual, whether that person wanted that reality check or not. A person is systematically broken down, detaching from themselves and attaching to the one doing the gaslighting. Cults often employ gaslighting to get oneness of mind, unity, sameness. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses don\u2019t just tell you what to think and how you should feel, they also demonize what YOU actually think and how YOU actually feel. Your thoughts and feelings are gradually replaced with theirs, as you start to doubt yourself and look to them to tell you if you\u2019re right or wrong in what you think, feel, and how you want to behave in this world. This is the first in a series where I\u2019ll break down the ways that the cult of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses is actively breaking individuals down, from what they do to why they do it to the real fruitage that it produces in those impacted by it. Learning what it looks like can help us to see remnants that may lie within ourselves, and perhaps even relationships that we may have kept or gravitated toward in our post-cult lives.

      "description": "Getting baptized as one of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses is a forever contract with a cult. In Justin\u2019s case, that decision to get dunked in a pool of water was made as a young man, a young man that knew he was gay. Because of that, ultimately he would never be able to be what they wanted him to be. He realized that if he were ever to be disfellowshipped from the cult because he was now an official member and they see being gay as a gross sin, he could now lose contact with his mother, the person that he cared about more than anything. The song that Justin chose to represent his journey is\u00A0Brand New Me by Alicia Keys.

But for many Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, their facial freedom was about to be granted as a result of something that is seemingly totally unrelated. Will these bearded brothers continue to grow their beards bred in captivity, or will they eventually become the free range beards that we all wish for them? Only time will tell, but this pandemic left its mark on the formerly fresh faces of these men.

      "description": "Finding a way out of a cult is one of the hardest things that a human can do. To find one\u2019s own way free, to take a stand against everything you\u2019ve ever known while knowing that it will cost you dearly, is hard. For many it costs them their entire family, and in this episode I talk with a couple that made it out together. That comes with its own unique challenges, and Natasha and Ben were open in discussing their struggles and victories along this path. Under the cover of Zoom meetings held during the height of Covid, Ben saw a path out of the cult of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. Listen to find out what that path was and how both of them found their way to freedom. The song that Natasha chose to represent her journey is\u00A0New Beginnings by Moonlight Scorpio, Equanimous, and Nyrus. The song that Ben chose to represent his journey is\u00A0Anthem Part 2 by Blink 182.

      "description": "Many people don\u2019t realize that Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses were among the many that were persecuted and brutally murdered by the German Nazi Party. Growing up, this was put to me as both a source of unusual pride but was also used to instill fear in me that someday this would likely happen again\u2026 to us, because it was always about us. We were told many JW centered stories about the event, and although I always knew intellectually that it was primarily the Jewish people that were targeted, it always felt like the event was really focused on us as Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. A trip in 2023 to St. Louis, and a spontaneous visit to the Kaplan Feldman Holocaust Museum that we didn\u2019t know existed until we were there, sparked a lot of feelings about that event and the portrayal of it by the cult of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.

No details were given, but it was foreboding. For the next few years Caressa, just 8 years of age, would face the abuse of that man. In time her story would come out, but unfortunately it would fall on deaf ears in the congregation, despite taking it to the police. A full decade later that \u201Cbrother\u201D in the congregation, still in good standing, would harm more innocent children and the congregation would disfellowship him. Who knows how many people he may have hurt in all of that time. For Caressa, this life of abuse and manipulation from her family, the cult, and this predator, left her no safe space. At the age of 17 she would ghost her family in search of safety, and a life of her own. This is her story.

      "description": "The Uprising Project is a new initiative in the community of former Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses to help these individuals with opportunities to find financial footing in a world that they were isolated from. According to one study by Pew Research of various religions and their incomes, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses had the lowest percentage of six figure household incomes at just 4%, while having the second highest percentage of household incomes below $30,000 per year at 48%*.  As a cult that promotes financial control by discouraging the pursuit of education, demonizing networking with anyone that is not of the same faith, and encouraging a lifestyle of devoting as much time to their religious pursuits as possible, it is no wonder that the group would struggle financially. Add to all of that the psychological warfare of abuse that leaves many feeling like they have no intrinsic value as an individual, and the subsequent extreme shunning for those that leave the group, and many continue to struggle after leaving. Financial stability is the basic ability to survive, and people need to survive before they can truly ever heal and have a possibility to thrive. The Uprising Project seeks to bring resources into the community to help individuals rise from the effects of prior abuses. Applications for inclusion in this project can be found at: https://exjwhelp.com/the-uprising-project/ The Rights and Religions Forum, and the Fellowship mentioned in the episode, can be found at: https://rarforum.org/fellows/ *https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2016/10/11/how-income-varies-among-u-s-religious-groups/   Are you struggling in some area of life?

Others, noticing the outward countenance as a result of that abuse, referred to her as \u201Cthe little girl without a smile\u201D. Being raised in the cult of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, she would be pushed into baptism at 17 years of age under false pretenses. As a result, just 6 months after being baptized, Natasha disassociated and left the cult behind, resulting in her shunning. Although the adults around her couldn\u2019t see what was really going on, a little girl named Yvette saw Natasha for who she really was and provided a safe space for her to be herself.

For Andrea, the cult reinforced the authority of her mom, and her mom ruled with fear. Under the ever watchful eye of a mother looking to mete out corporal punishment, the beatings were so bad that her sister took some for her out of fear that she would be killed. Their mother would die of cancer while they were still young, and Andrea\u2019s older sister cared for her while the congregation that had been silent about the abuse remained aloof. Only once it was thought that Andrea might need to be reprimanded by congregation elders did anyone reach out to her. Thus began the journey to freedom that she always wished to find.

I felt it would be a good idea to have a companion to the JW carts, the Awake to one\u0027s Watchtower of sorts. Thank you to those in my local area, including several never JWs, for giving me tips on where to find the carts. You made this possible. If you want to start your own cart, you can find all of the files and links to everything mentioned at the following link:\u00A0https://exjwhelp.com/exjw-activism/ Please subscribe to follow the journey and as this project continues and grows, you\u0027ll be the first to know when I make adjustments to the cart or release new files on various subjects that you can download for your own cart. These projects all have real costs attached to them. Parking, tolls, gas, cameras, equipment, carts, and so much more time than you would ever think editing and producing it all. Each episode of the regular Shunned Podcast takes probably 8 hours or so from start to finish, including fielding correspondence and making posts to share and production, editing, etc. My cart videos take a lot of time to produce. And I have websites and such that I put time and money into as well each month to host files for this project.

      "description": "In the concept of gaslighting, one person is trying to create the reality for another person in order to gain or maintain control of them. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are masters of gaslighting, weaponizing what is near and dear to others against them, shaming them for who they are and what they want in this life. For Taylor there was massive internal confusion as she got older and realized that there were parts of her personality that didn\u2019t actually come from the cult\u2019s influence. Those parts of her, such as the very normal and natural attraction to someone else, created great inner conflict and external turmoil in a world where her desires weren\u2019t allowed. And thus the realization that gaslighting can be internalized and turned against ourselves felt overwhelming to a young person not equipped to deal with the ramifications and grief caused by a life lived according to the influence of those with power around her. She realized that in order to continue to live the life she was given, she would have to gaslight herself out of things that she actually wanted. Ultimately she would come to grieve the parts of her that were lost during those times, the time lost, the people that could never truly love her for who she was but rather a vision of who they wanted her to be, and she would go on a quest to find herself. It is said that grief is just love without a home, so she went on a journey to find that home in herself by learning to love a person that others were incapable of loving because of their desire for control.

You might even be scared reading this, but if you are, that shows that what you\u2019ve been taught is very fear based, and you should absolutely question why someone would do that. Why would someone want to control what information you are exposed to? Courage isn\u2019t the absence of fear, but feeling the fear and doing it anyway. You are about to take a courageous step, one of many that can unlock a life that is founded in actual truth, not just what you\u2019ve been told is true. So take heart that others like you are out here, that we love you, that we\u2019ve been wherever you are today, and that you are doing the right thing for yourself even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it in the moment. There are other wonderful people out here that were hurt by something that was supposed to be good. Take this and go buy yourself your favorite coffee or treat. This money was donated by others that are out here. You are not alone.  With real love that doesn\u2019t shun, we send hugs and treats. ThisJwLife.com ShunnedPodcast.com ExJwHelp.com",

      "description": "Daniel knew from a young age that the cult of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses was supposed to come first in his life. In his teenage years Daniel would start to realize that something wasn\u2019t right and that \u201CThe Truth\u201D wasn\u2019t actually true, and he took those doubts to his father. His mother would soon be diagnosed with cancer that would take her life, and in that time he would push his doubts aside and try to give his mom something by getting baptized, as the religion was the focal point for the family even as they rallied around his mom. Later in life, as a father himself, Daniel would start to realize his disconnect again as he tried to indoctrinate his own kids, which would lead him to the discoveries that real research can bring. Ultimately it would cost him certain relationships because of their stand for the religion, but he had to do what was right and not simply what the religion he was given pushed upon him. Daniel referenced two resources in his episode:  Carl Sagan \u2013 The Demon-Haunted World \u2013 Science as a Candle in the Dark The Great Courses\u00A0, specifically a course on critical thinking. Upon researching it I found that Your Deceptive Mind \u2013 A Scientific Guide on Critical Thinking Skills can also be found on Amazon as an audiobook that looks much cheaper if you aren\u2019t into all of The Great Courses and I\u2019ll link that\u00A0HERE Support today\u2019s guest by leaving him a comment\u00A0HERE Support the show by donating to the cause on our Patreon page,\u00A0Patreon.com/shunned  Are you struggling in some area of life?

Although from the outside people may have seen them one way as they put on a good show, the realities didn\u2019t match up at home. Instead of living out loud, they had to be silent and to hide themselves, becoming small so as not to be seen in a home environment that didn\u2019t feel safe. Later in life Trish would be encouraged to even deny the existence of her sons by the wife of an elder, to make them invisible, as they were not who the cult wanted them to be either. This is a story of reclaiming a life that was a false show of something that wasn\u2019t real underneath, and of finding oneself and being free to be authentic.

Growing up in an abusive home with his stepdad, who was only 11 years older than him, Kevyn couldn\u2019t be himself. At an early age he had to be who he needed to be to survive at home and to try to make friends with the limited opportunities that he had as an isolated member of the cult of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. Eventually he would finally earn positive attention from his stepdad because he made it to Bethel, cult headquarters, where he quickly learned that not everyone there was who they appeared to be either. Finding the \u201Cdegenerate\u201D Bethelites, he learned that there was a world outside to explore, and eventually through several more changes he would find himself enlisting in the Army to leave the life that he had behind as he changed yet again to save himself.

Inside the cult of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, opportunities for failure abound and the constant refrain of \u201CI\u2019m never good enough\u201D echoes in the minds of those exposed to it. But what if a family that started out in the cult started to change the narrative? What would it be like to change the way you see the world as parents, and to then try to implement that change with your own children so as to give everyone a chance at success, instead of abundant focus on failing? How would you feel as that parent? What challenges would arise that perhaps you never even considered if you grew up JW yourself? What beautiful possibilities could lie ahead?

      "description": "Growing up, Rachel moved roughly 15 times between the ages of 5 and 19. Without much stability other than the consistency of the cult of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and her parents in her life, she was forced to move and adapt to new situations without attaching to anything. The out of control feelings and trauma stood to threaten her very existence, but eventually Rachel found better days outside of the cult and more stability in her life. This is Rachel\u2019s story. The songs that Rachel chose to represent her journey are\u00A0I Did Something Bad by Taylor Swift,\u00A0My Tears Ricochet by Taylor Swift, and\u00A0I\u2019m Not Angry Anymore by Paramore.

This is the underpinning of what it is to be one of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, to know that you don\u2019t deserve any chance at salvation as a good for nothing sinner, and to know that you don\u2019t even deserve the life that you have now. For Joel, he had something else going on internally that served as yet an extra obstacle to his existence in the cult, and he was left wondering how that could possibly be fair. Why would he have something above and beyond what others had to contend with to try to be good enough for a God that hated a part of who he was.

He found himself living for others because he just wanted to make his parents proud, but in the end he came to realize that when everything broke down, they didn\u2019t even know their own son. Unlike them, he came to the defense of a gay friend, he struggled to judge people with the harsh judgment of the cult, and ultimately he stood up for himself, a self that nobody ever knew.

That reality creates dissonance between who one is and who they have been raised and pressured to be by the adults around them. In this episode you\u2019ll learn about the fork in the road for Daniel where he had to choose between who he truly was, something he finally got to have a taste of, and who he was expected to be. He could actually realize all of the things that he ever wanted, or continue to be who other people wanted him to be. This was his point of no return, and the point at which he would be shunned.

      "description": "Coming from a cult that discouraged education and that even discouraged pursuing an upward trajectory in a career, as the cult activity itself was seen as our primary career, it can be hard to know where to start to find one. In this episode of the ExJwHelp series we will explore many career options that others have found that don\u2019t require a college education. There are many paths and perhaps seeing what others have found will be an inspiration to you. We don\u2019t have to settle for the default settings offered to us by a cult. Instead, we can learn from one another and find ways to move up and better the only lives that we actually have instead of waiting for false promises of a future that isn\u2019t coming.

      "description": "Fostered by a woman in the congregation of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, little Ashley caught the eye of the person that would adopt her as a part of their family. All Ashley wanted was to be \u201Cnormal\u201D, but her adoptive parents were in a cult that didn\u2019t allow for such. She would do all of the things asked of her by her adoptive family and tried to connect to the performative spirituality around her while ultimately feeling empty in that environment. Sadly, as Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses do, the very people that made the choice to adopt her into their family would also make the choice to shun her later when she wasn\u2019t who they wanted her to be. As mentioned in the episode, here\u2019s a link to\u00A0Episode 120 on How To Go To College\u00A0.

Trying to get the elders to understand the severity of the abuse in her home, words that fell on deaf ears, she would take the courageous step of leaving her marriage only to be looked down upon for doing so. Such is life when you\u2019ve been conditioned to tolerate abuse from an early age to endure the cult of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. In this episode you will learn JoHannah\u2019s story, sadly full of abuse in a cult that protects abusers (her dad was shunned for smoking while her childhood abuser ran free), but more than that you\u2019ll learn about the indomitable person and spirit that is JoHannah and her path out.

A mother that was dependent on alcohol and disfellowshipped from the cult of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses twice, move after move after move, including living with a grandmother that was also eventually disfellowshipped, there was a lot of chaos at times. Having not really been interested in \u201CThe Truth\u201D as JWs call it, a chance month of field ministry around the age of 16 with a young couple that showed him interest would change everything. Well, not quite everything, as Harrison was gay and knew it, but he would end up serving at the headquarters of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, Bethel. You\u2019ll learn about Harrison as a person, as a JW, and as a Bethelite, along with some insights into the culture of Bethel, a place that is idolized by members of the cult.

      "description": "After a night spent with her boyfriend talking, a relationship that as one of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses she wasn\u2019t supposed to have because he wasn\u2019t in the cult, a phone call comes in from Elizabeth\u2019s father wanting to know where she is. After replying that she was at Waffle House planning a wedding with her friend and that she just lost track of time, she told her boyfriend that now they had to go to Waffle House. Why? Because she had to \u201Cmake it be true\u201D.  If those four words aren\u2019t the epitome of what it is to be one of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, I don\u2019t know what is. The desire to \u201Cmake it be true\u201D, to ignore all evidence to the contrary, to continue to uphold a dedication coerced through cult influence often as children, and to justify the sunk cost at all costs, is what leads so many to stay in something that isn\u2019t good for them. It leads to people living an inauthentic life because they\u2019re in so far that they have to \u201Cmake it be true\u201D because the cost of leaving is so high although they\u2019ve already lost so much while being in. Elizabeth has such a story of her own to share, including a harrowing experience with a predatory cult member that she was saved from just before it got much worse.

Amanda is forced to hide her body with oversized clothes yet is called a slut at home.

      "description": "The cult of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses has some interesting takes on life and death. On one hand, as today\u2019s guest puts it, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses give up on life before it even starts because to them this world is going to end and this life is but a means to that end. On the other hand, they believe that they have the \u201Creal life\u201D talked about in scripture, even sporting the hashtag bestlifeever on some of their social media posts. And when someone no longer believes in the doctrine of their group, that person is viewed as dead to them. They are shunned and treated as though they are no longer living.  In a 1952 Watchtower magazine, a question from the readers was answered as follows: \u201C\u25CF In the case of where a father or mother or son or daughter is disfellowshiped, how should such person be treated by members of the family in their family relationship?\u2014P. C., Ontario, Canada. We are not living today among theocratic nations where such members of our fleshly family relationship could be exterminated for apostasy from God and his theocratic organization, as was possible and was ordered in the nation of Israel\u00A0in the wilderness of Sinai and in the land of Palestine. \u201CThou shalt surely kill him; thy hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people. And thou shalt stone him to death with stones, because he hath sought to draw thee away from Jehovah thy God, .\u00A0.\u00A0. And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is in the midst of thee.\u201D\u2014Deut. 13:6-11,\u00A0AS. Being limited by the laws of the worldly nation in which we live and also by the laws of God through Jesus Christ,\u00A0we can take action against apostates only to a certain extent, that is, consistent with both sets of laws. The law of the land and God\u2019s law through Christ forbid us to kill apostates, even though they be members of our own flesh-and-blood family relationship.\u00A0However, God\u2019s law requires us to recognize their being disfellowshiped from his congregation, and this despite the fact that the law of the land in which we live requires us under some natural obligation to live with and have dealings with such apostates under the same roof.\u201D As you can see, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses almost lament the fact that they can\u2019t kill apostates, people that leave their cult. Today\u2019s guest, at just 19 years of age, is very much on death row, so to speak. He is PIMO, or physically in the cult but mentally out. Because he no longer believes what he was brought up to believe, he knows that eventually he will be disfellowshipped, executed as it were. In fact, doing this interview could be that very death knell for him. His bravery in speaking out shows the depth of his desire to live free from the bonds put upon him as a child by his family. He hopes to inspire and encourage others to live free too. Everyone deserves that chance. The songs that he chose to represent his journey are\u00A0In The End by Linkin Park\u00A0and\u00A0The Nights by Avicii.

As he realized that he did not belong there once again, and as he felt this darkness in the Kingdom Hall, Dylan would do something that would change the course of his life. On the congregation\u2019s wifi while the meeting was going on, Dylan took a chance on Dylan for the first time. He took a chance to open a door that would lead him to eventual freedom even while sitting in a mental prison with everyone else. Listen to his story to learn about his family that was a constant in the congregation, his mother that married an ex-Scientologist and ended up in Africa, and what pushed him to have the courage on that fateful day to do something unthinkable for most in the cult of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. The song that Dylan chose to represent his journey is\u00A0I\u2019m Not Okay But I Know I\u2019m Going To Be by Raleigh Ritchie.

      "description": "Coming from a cult that actively discouraged even basic education at times, it can be daunting to even contemplate trying to pursue higher education. What is it like to be a non-traditional student? How can I afford to go? Are there ways to pursue this without the support of my parents? How do I even apply? In this episode we answer your questions as submitted through the Shunned Podcast Facebook group, r/exjw on reddit and so much more.  We talk strategies on how to finance your education, how to figure out what you even want to pursue, the unexpected benefits of the college experience, etc. You will hear the real world experiences of not just our main guest as she shares her experience and expertise in this field, but you will also get to hear four other short real world stories at the end to help round out your knowledge as you understand what this is like from people that have actually done it. This is the first in our ExJwHelp series. The goal is to do a follow-up episode on careers that one can pursue without a college education if that isn\u2019t for you, as well as self-employed or small business endeavors that you can strive for. The ExJwHelp series is part of the Cult Recovery Coaching program offered at ExJwHelp.com and the hope is to grow it to include a wide variety of topics that can help as you move forward in real and actionable ways.

      "description": "Being raised in the cult of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses involves being taught to chase love. If a person can only be good enough, one day their god will love them. But being taught this can lead to people going back to things that treat them poorly, whether it is their god, their religion, their family, etc. as a part of chasing that love. Aaron was both disfellowshipped and divorced and each time he went back, something that many have done, always holding out hope that this time will be different. It is tough to learn this lesson and many have been held in suspension, but Aaron has found more solid ground today and has learned his lessons from going back. The song that Aaron chose to represent his journey is\u00A0Amazing by Aerosmith. He also added\u00A0Take Me To Church by Hosier.

His great grandfather was of the anointed with the heavenly hope back in the 1930s when the option of an earthly hope was brought to the fore, his great grandmother holding that earthly hope. So this cult has its fingerprints all over the family, and Heath grew up only knowing one way of life. \u201CThere was no doubt. There was no room to doubt. There was no way to doubt.\u201D The prescribed path of a JW was set out before him, but a moment in 2003 changed everything for Heath.

The words spoken by her therapist in rehab, \u201CIn this religion, what do you really have\u201D, made Mackenzie look at the harsh realities of her life in the cult of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. Worried about what she would lose, she had to first take a look at what she really had. Sadly, what she had was a life that was so traumatic she developed DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder) and that had driven her to self harm. Failing to receive any real help from her family and the congregation, with a mother encouraging her to cut again because she was better to be around when self-harming, Mackenzie would find help with others that were working through their own pains that finally brought real support to her life.

      "description": "When we lose the ones we love, we say some words. We remember them. We reminisce about the good times, and it\u2019s for the memory of the ones we lose as well as for ourselves. Sarah was not given a proper funeral. This was due to her status of being Shunned (Disfellowshipped) from her religion, and as her husband I\u2019ve not had closure. Because of this I\u2019ve carried a burden and words unspoken for the last few years, and no one knows her full story \u2013 her struggles and final moments. Thank you to Michael Shemwell for helping me work through my loss and for putting together a way to remember Sarah and share her story. Sarah Nelson Harding will always be remembered by many as the light in the room, and the life of the group! She had such energy, and fun about her, a love for life and desire to grow. She was very artistic and expressed her feelings through drawing and painting, and had a wide range of loved music that was close to her heart to cover all of the emotions. She was adventurous and outgoing, and more so than I thought I ever was! Nearly every amazing memory I have was with her, and she only graced my life for less than 5 years. We polar plunged in the Fox River in the middle of a Chicago winter, and dove from the tops of cliffs into Cenotes in Mexico!! We rode a catamaran in the Caribbean and went Skydiving (indoor though)! She introduced me to karaoke and my own love of music, even meeting a political figure while singing karaoke one night, which turned into a dear friend of ours! She had a way about her, even when she sang in front on a crowd of strangers, she had no inhibitions and would belt out Journey as if she was on tour!! I would never have known that someone could sing so beautifully and be out of key!! Every time, she would get standing applause from the entire room!! We had a practice of eating healthy and being active, and that woman was very strong! Her red hair gave her the nickname of Red Beast!! And I was Uber Beast, to follow suit with the nickname and not necessarily because I was fit. She couldn\u2019t have children of her own, but she fiercely loved her niece and nephew, and her friends children that she referred to as her minions! But she would have been a wonderful mother had she had the opportunity. Sarah had so much life ahead of her! And I miss her every day, as many do. I can only imagine the pain in the heart of her family and friends that willfully shunned her and caused her great pain. They believe they were doing what God wanted them to do. I do not blame them. Rather, I encourage them to be WILLING to ask questions and seek answers. Shunning someone you love does not feel good, because it isn\u2019t. Someone else is telling you to lose your natural affection for someone in order to blackmail them to come back on hands and knees for an offense that you are not allowed to know the details of. Don\u2019t be manipulated. Truth does not mind being questioned. A lie does not like being challenged. \u2013 Cameron The song that Cameron chose to represent Sarah\u2019s story is\u00A0Far Behind by Candlebox.

      "description": "Trigger Warning \u2013 This episode deals with abuse and suicide. Born in raised in a family that looked the part of good Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, Nicole knew the truth. Her father was a violent alcoholic, her mother suffered from dissociative identity disorder (multiple personalities), and her escape was to spend time with another JW family on weekends that put her in the clutches of a sexual predator. When she reported what happened, she was threatened with disfellowshipping and shunning if she cooperated with the police. Sadly, this is just the beginning of a life spent dealing with cycles of abuse, and Nicole has had to put in a lifetime worth of effort to rise above circumstances while learning what a healthy life can be through it all.

From an early age she knew that it wasn\u2019t for her, but her mother let her know that she would never help her out if she wasn\u2019t a JW later in life and that pressure was intense. Because of that Jael would find herself going in and out of the cult. In the end she finds that continued exposure to the cult only leads to drama as couple from the local Kingdom Hall tries to steal her uncle\u2019s estate from the family. Sometimes it is okay not to fit in with the people that you\u2019ve been exposed to in life. The song that Jael chose to represent her story is\u00A0How To Disappear Completely by Radiohead.

But what she also experienced was her mother\u2019s reaction, a reaction that lacked care or compassion for the person that was now seen as lost, a reaction that lacked any real care for Nia as well. \u201CDon\u2019t you EVER embarrass me the way she embarrassed her mother!\u201D  And there you have a relationship summed up in one quick remark, a relationship that would leave Nia trying desperately to earn her mother\u2019s love, a love that should be natural and without conditions based on a particular cult belief system, but a love that Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses lack. If a person has to earn that love through performance based measures in a cult, that love can just as easily be lost. In this episode you\u2019ll follow Nia\u2019s journey from a little girl trying to earn her mother\u2019s love to a woman learning to love herself.

      "description": "\u201CHonestly I just always felt horrible about going, it never felt like this was my calling or this was where I needed to be. It was quite the opposite actually.\u201D Baptized at 15 as one of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, Christina knew that this really wasn\u2019t the place for her but did what she needed to do in order to get by. When her life took twists and turns over the years, she would at one point find herself living with her father and stepmother in strange circumstances. Medications were pushed on her, they would refuse to use the same dishes as her or share a bathroom with her, and of course shunning came into the relationship as well. The song that Christina chose to represent her story is\u00A0Beautiful Pain by Eminem.

      "description": "Rama was a spiritual teacher in the 80s and 90s who inspired many of his students while leading what many of his detractors would call a cult.\u00A0 He defied the typical vision of a New Age leader, trading in minimalism in favor of wealth and celebrity.\u00A0 He was also a man ahead of his time, encouraging his students to develop careers in computer science before that was mainstream.  For some, following Rama\u0027s lead worked out spiritually and financially.\u00A0 But for others, Rama\u0027s actions contradicted the version of him that he projected, others vanished, whistleblowers went to the media, and the group began to shrink and splinter.  In this 10 part investigative series, Jonathan Hirsch explores the life, death and and impact of Rama, also known as Dr. Frederick Lenz.

When her mother finally got serious about \u201CThe Truth\u201D, she had a rare opportunity to make her mom proud as her mom asked her to study, and she obliged. Za\u2019kaeda\u2019s story is one of trying hard to be someone she wasn\u2019t for people that didn\u2019t truly appreciate it only to be shunned in the end and then told by elders in her congregation not to dare trying to talk to her mother because this is already hard enough on her.

      "description": "Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses claim to be a religion guided by love. Throughout Joe\u2019s story a common them arises though: \u201Cwhere is the love?\u201D. We know that they practice shunning and call that love, but daily life inside of the cult also shows it to be sorely lacking. Joe\u2019s story involves a lack of love starting in the congregation and only gets more personal from there, as it does for many former Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. Note: There is an update to Joe\u2019s story available for those watching on YouTube. The link is in the description for this episode at\u00A0the shunnedpodcast YouTube Channel. The song that Joe chose to represent his story is\u00A0The Day That Never Comes by Metallica.

Not as a celebrity, nor anyone with clout, but as an average person going to a local church and trying to assimilate into the only life that you know? Laurel tells her personal story of growing up as a Scientologist, joining the Sea Org at just 13 years of age, getting married, her path toward becoming a \u201Cword clearer\u201D, and one particular way to leave the Sea Org to obtain freedom.  This isn\u2019t just a story about Scientology though, this is a story about how a belief system can impact a family, and ultimately this is a human story about a little girl growing up and facing some things that most people will never have to face. From the normal desire to fit in and make friends to her life being pulled into the extreme emotional control of the group, to having to stare into someone else\u2019s eyes without breaking gaze for hours at a time, Laurel has an experience to share.

Secret meetings, smuggling cult propaganda into the country, specious credentials, etc. But doing this work would backfire as it forced Geoff to realize certain things about the cult that he was involved in.

      "description": "One of the things that really stands out at times is how much people put into following these high control groups, or cults, and how little it takes to get a person kicked out and shunned. Years, even decades can be spent serving faithfully, but one simple statement by a once sincere follower can be all it takes to start the path to shunning. \u201CI wish they were just more open minded\u201D, a reasonable remark and a personal feeling expressed to the wrong person who told the elders started the process for Allison. Her answer to the infamous question often asked in their secret judicial committees, \u201Cdo you view Jehovah\u2019s organization as your authority\u201D, would seal her fate. A fourth generation Jehovah\u2019s Witness, and everything changed so quickly. There\u2019s often no credit for time served in a cult. The song chosen by Allison to represent her story is\u00A0Let The Mystery Be by Iris DeMent.

Today Z is a gender non-binary person that has found themselves after a life as one of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses that tried to force conformity rather than authenticity.

      "description": "Note: This episode gets very real, including potential triggers surrounding suicide and sexual assault. It is important to discuss the realities of these things and we hope that it helps others. Kayla was very brave in sharing her life story.  Sadly a cycle of abuse is often like a role that gets played over and over again. We typically think of it in the role of abusers that repeat patterns, but so do those who are abused. Kayla\u2019s story includes abusive behaviors from parents, her husband at the time, and of course the cult of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. At every turn when she needed something healthy she was met with unhealthy toxic behavior. This wasn\u2019t limited to her but also included some of her siblings. From growing up to being married to custody battles to dealing with pedophiles, the JWs sided with and allowed abuse to perpetuate on their watch.  Kayla is a strong person that not only made it through these situations but she\u2019s actively working to better her life as she heals from the trauma caused by members of a group claiming to have not only \u201CThe Truth\u201D doctrinally but also to have the happiest families on earth. They even use a hashtag for their cult, #bestlifeever. By their fruits you will recognize the true religion, according to them. Kayla\u2019s story shows yet again that their fruitage is not just rotten, but poisonous, as Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses utterly destroy families and individuals alike with their corrupt practices. The song that Kayla chose to represent her journey is\u00A0Heaven is a Place on Earth by Belinda Carlisle.

I knew I was letting Jehovah down.\u201D How does someone get to this place so young? Ramo was baptized at just 8 years old into a cult that denies one the ability to be themselves, that forces children into a mold whether it fits or not, and that lets them know from early on how defective they are. The only cure is to serve Jehovah by following whatever the cult says. \u201CThe crazier you sound, the better a witness you are.\u201D Ramo learned over time how to work the system to survive mentally and emotionally in a dysfunctional environment in both his family and the cult. Eventually he found his way to freedom and now he tells his story to help others see the realities found inside the cult of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.

      "description": "\u201CI\u2019m not sorry for who I am.\u201D When you think about that statement and life as one of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, it holds certain weight. But what if you were born into a body that didn\u2019t fit the person that you knew yourself to be? Meet Mitch, a trans man that had to go on quite a journey to be himself. When you grow up in a cult, where you are supposed to be like everyone else, it takes tremendous courage to be yourself. Sadly it often comes with a heavy price as well, but that freedom to be oneself is priceless.  Note: There were some technical issues recording this episode in video format via Zoom so both the video and audio versions have an awkward moment or three where we had trouble syncing up and one or the other of us ended up talking over the other. We did our best to overcome the lagging that we dealt with. The songs that Mitch chose to represent his journey are\u00A0My Immortal\u00A0and also\u00A0Bring Me To Life\u00A0by Evanescence. He also chose the song\u00A0In The End\u00A0by Linkin Park. Support the show by donating to the cause on our Patreon page,\u00A0Patreon.com/shunned  Are you struggling in some area of life?

Although it was all that she ever knew, she could see that some things didn\u2019t add up from an early age and struggled to adopt everything she had been told. She was told to shun her own mother by her father, while at the same time all she wanted was love and attention from her parents like any normal child. In her story you will learn what woke her up and her path out. This story does involve suicide attempts and sexual abuse.

      "description": "One reason that people are attracted to cults is that they are looking for stability in life. They may feel vulnerable and are looking for answers, something to hold on to that allows them to leave their troubles behind. Unfortunately the reality of what cults offer is nothing more than a surface level illusion of stability covering over deep dysfunction, beliefs that people use as an escape for their problems. It is like quicksand. It looks like firm ground but once you take the first step things just slowly get worse and worse. Stephanie grew up in a somewhat chaotic environment. She could be found beating her dolls while \u201Cplaying meeting\u201D because the dolls weren\u2019t listening. At fourteen her father started suffering from mental issues that altered his view of reality at times. Her home wasn\u2019t stable from the environment in it to where she physically lived, even moving in with another family at eighteen. Then in her pursuit of stability she would look for it in marriage and find anything but that. Disfellowshipped three times, Stephanie finally realized that what she was seeking could only truly be found in another life and she had to go find it. The song that Stephanie chose to represent her journey is\u00A0Praying by Kesha.

Some would equate shunning to exactly that, essentially aborting someone from your life and treating them as though they are dead. All because a person, even a mother\u2019s own son, simply chose another path. \u201CI just want to be normal\u201D, the words of a depressed 15 year old Mario growing up as one of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. Living in a self-described \u201Cpolice state\u201D in his own home, the harsh fundamentalist upbringing resulted in a life of frustration and anger where nothing was ever good enough in that environment to garner trust.  Mario overcame so much to finally have a chance to find himself, and he shares his story today to help others going through similar circumstances. We talk about his time growing up JW, how he was treated in his own home growing up after the shunning started, his time spent after being pushed out and the impact it had on him, and how he has continued to work on himself to grow into someone that he can be proud of. The song that Mario chose to represent his journey is\u00A0The Unforgiven by Metallica.

Often times people will say \u201Cit\u2019s not like you had a gun to your head so you had a choice\u201D, but they\u2019re wrong on both counts. JWs hold a god to your head, a god that will let you live if you make the right choice and that will kill you if you choose any other path. What kind of choice is that? It sounds more like extortion.  Ryan\u2019s baptism was just part of his story of looking for connection and stability. Instead of people talking to him they far more often talked about him. He tried everything to be what they wanted him to be, including undergoing conversion therapy to try to suppress his sexuality. Ultimately Ryan had to make a choice to be himself.

      "description": "Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses have a practice called \u201Cdisfellowshipping\u201D that at one point long ago even Watchtower estimated at costing them 70,000 members per year. Tens of thousands of people are cast out of their group and shunned to an extreme degree. They tell their members that the practice is one of love. Is that true? They also have a narrative about shunning that they tell the general public through the FAQ section of their official website. Are those answers true?  A letter was leaked on Twitter from a JW circuit overseer. Per direction from the organization he was looking for positive stories of shunning inside the organization. In particular they wanted to hear from those that openly express their confidence that the disfellowshipping arrangement is loving, and that they had personally benefited from this discipline. Preferably, the experiences should illustrate the points in the second, third, and fourth paragraphs in the article Do Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Shun Those Who Used To Belong To Their Religion (from their official website). That\u2019s exactly what they asked for word for word in their letter. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to look at. So follow along as we examine their words. As we do you\u2019ll hear from real life stories of people that volunteered to call in and leave voicemails in response to questions asked regarding the claims made by the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and Watchtower. Those familiar with the cult know that they refer to their doctrine as \u201CThe Truth\u201D. Let\u2019s see how honest they really are in the narrative that they sell the general public. I want to thank Andy, Chris, Stephanie, M.K., Patrick, Mario, Lydia, Lisa, \u201CJ\u201D, Vicki, and Rebecca for lending their voice and personal experiences to this project voluntarily.

      "description": "The year was 2014. The event was the annual meeting of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses streamed all over the world. And then it happened\u2026\u2026.\u201DTight Pants Tony\u201D was born. A young Karamat was watching, and if stumbling someone results in the person doing the stumbling being cast into the water with a millstone around his neck, ol\u2019 Tony Morris of the governing body of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses might need a bigger neck for all of the stumbling he did that day.  Karamat was a young enthusiastic member of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses but he also had friends outside of the organization and could never embrace the JW teaching that his friends would be killed in a fiery Armageddon by his God. He was an intelligent young man, one that started to wake up around the time of the annual meeting whereby Tony Morris ranted unintelligibly about women wearing \u201Cspanx\u201D and men wearing tight pants designed by the homosexuals. Let\u2019s also not forget his hatred of colorful or fun socks. On the world stage when he could have encouraged people in any way he saw fit, he went on a homophobic rant about clothing. He also railed against amusement parks if cult followers weren\u2019t spending time visiting the Watchtower headquarters, among other inane assertions such as what standing one should have in the congregation in order to be considered marriage material.  A young man of intelligence and emotional/mental honesty, Karamat would go on a journey toward more education and less ignorance. He couldn\u2019t abide by the elder\u2019s warnings to give up his \u201Cworldly\u201D friends on the outside, and of course he had an interest in relationships beyond friendships as a normal young man. He also had questions for which the elders didn\u2019t have answers. This resulted in him being kicked out of his home, being homeless for a time, suffering depression, losing people he thought were his friends because Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses truly shoot their wounded, and he started his life over at a young age. The song that Karamat chose to represent his journey is\u00A0Toussaint L\u2019Overture by Santana.

The parties, the relationship she had with her husband, and the relationships that he had outside of their relationship.

We start discussing some history of the Bible Students that I then researched later myself personally and found fascinating. But this story is much more than a throwback, this story features much of the modern issues within the cult of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. Joseph got caught up in a bad situation with an elder and his wife, ending up married to that elder\u2019s wife. Just like he got caught up as an adult with a cult, he was caught up in another bad relationship. He also saw other abuse while in the organization and knew that he wanted out of all of it.

Meeting this person at just 16 years of age would send her down an intense path of self-denial at the behest of him and others that would come into her life. Ultimately she was manipulated into doing what they wanted. For a religion that calls itself \u201CThe Truth\u201D this story involves so many lies, the ones told to others, the ones she told to herself, and the ones told to her. The cult dynamics were seen in her relationship early on.

      "description": "People get baptized as Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses for a myriad of reasons. Peer pressure, parental pressure, sometimes people feel like it will fix something in their lives. For Derek there was the hope that this 11 year old boy could erase the damage and shame he felt from the abuse he suffered at the hands of some of the girls in his life. The hope that somehow baptism would make him whole and feel safe. Derek has been through a lot in his life but he\u2019s now got a life of his own that he can be proud of and he offers some of the lessons he\u2019s learned to help others. This is a story of overcoming the past and the strength to create the things that a person wants in the present. The song that Derek chose to represent his journey is\u00A0Wash It Away by Nahko and Medicine for the People.

She had always led a double life, the one that she wanted, and the one that she was being forced into as one of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. As a child with no young people in her congregation her only friends were those older than her at the Kingdom Hall, or the occasional \u201Cworldly\u201D kid that she could have over as long as she spent that time studying and trying to indoctrinate them. This is a story of a person that knew that they didn\u2019t want to live a life that they were given and that eventually was pushed so far mentally and emotionally that she gave in and truly became sincere in her efforts to be everything that everyone had always wanted her to be. She finally wanted it. They had succeeded in making her low enough that she truly wanted to be one of them, and you will find out how that went through Rebecca\u2019s story in this episode.

We all want to see these children find love and belonging in a home. What happens when one of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses happens to be the foster parent? This is one person\u2019s story of being introduced to the cult through a foster parent.  Taira begins her journey into it at the ages of nine through eleven and it created a bond between herself and her foster parent, but also Jehovah, and that would stick with her for years as she searched for a permanent family. This is a really interesting personal story that gives insights into a situation that is very seldom talked about, and I think that there are lessons to be taken away from it. There are obvious issues such as the impact on a child that is seeking unconditional love and belonging only to find themselves in an extremely conditional relationship with Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.

      "description": "Fifty episodes. Fifty long form discussions looking into the lives of people that share the pain of shunning from cults or high-control religious groups. Fifty families that have been torn apart, fifty people that have had to grieve the loss of people that are still alive. Today we close in on roughly 200,000 individual downloads from people that have been touched by these fifty brave people that have chosen to speak up. Shunning is designed to take your voice away and by participating you\u2019re not only taking it back but you\u2019re amplifying it and people are listening.  I get the emails from people that listen because it gives them a greater understanding of their friend or relative that is in a cult. I get the emails from people that have been negatively impacted by these groups though never involved. I get the emails from people that have lost people that they cared about to suicide, or that have attempted themselves, or are feeling that way right now because of involvement with these religious groups. I also get the emails from people that have found these stories inspiring and healing, as well as emails from those that told their stories and found the experience cathartic and empowering. In a world where bullying is universally condemned, shunning is still not only practiced, but encouraged by large organizations that are given charitable status by the governments of this world. They need to see what kind of real \u201Ccharity\u201D these cults are about. The world at large needs to wake up to the realities of these groups and they should not be rewarded for their bigotry.  In this episode we will hear what telling their story has done for a handful of people that were generous enough to come back on the podcast to give some updates. It can be truly healing for the individual, and also through these stories we affect change. These people have impacted the lives of others in a positive way by telling their stories and sharing with the world.  You will hear from David, Sydney, Torah, \u201CV\u201D, Jenny, and myself in this episode. Life after shunning goes on, and we can find better things and happiness if we keep moving forward.

The former created many issues in the latter for young Xitlalitl as she struggled to fit in as they moved from place to place when her mom would have issues with people in the congregation. In the end when the constant gaslighting and the buy-in from congregation elders created a desperation to leave the situation, those feelings almost cost her everything. This is a callback to episode 29 with Nico as the two are in a relationship now and he helped her escape in more ways than one. This episode deals with BPD, depression, suicide, and the realities of the way the cult appeals to authority and recognizes title and position over people, from their beliefs to the way they \u201Chelp\u201D those in their midst.

      "description": "Kelsey was a kid that grew up sincere as one of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses but that ultimately followed his heart and lived a \u201Cdouble life\u201D. He always felt like something was off with the Witnesses but when he started being authentic they showed him who they truly were. He tells about waking up at 15 years old, his last time ever in the field ministry and how he left the cult behind, as well as how his life has gone since leaving. His is a story of trying to live someone else\u2019s life and then finding his own. Now he even has his own little life to look out for without any support or interest from the people that once called him family. The song Kelsey chose to represent his journey is\u00A0Unanswered by Suicide Silence.

A common theme seems to be the emotional desert that they all grew up in, a dearth of emotional health which is a hallmark of the JW faith. A lack of authenticity, not talking about the things that matter, pushing your feelings away, these are all ways to survive in a high control environment where daring to be yourself can have dire consequences.

So if you want you can watch the two of us talk over video chat on Youtube on the shunnedpodcast channel.\u00A0You can watch the interview HERE if you like. Candace was the bad kid growing up. Marked by those around her for being too funny, asking too many questions, and not coming from the right family. She wanted to have a good life, a life that she thought would come if she did the right things, just like Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses often teach. If she could be the perfect JW and marry a brother with privileges and be a pioneer then her life would be all that she imagined as a kid, when her family life wasn\u2019t what she wanted and she blamed her parents\u2019 shortcomings in life on their lack of JW activity.  After we finished the interview she shared a story about her uncle that is touching, so stick around for that even after it sounds like we\u2019ve wound down.

One of the things that Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses do poorly is supporting and looking out for the mental and emotional well-being of their members. Cassie experienced multiple changes in her life where she needed to be seen and helped within the congregation in a real way and they never managed to connect to her until later in life when they reached out in a judicial manner. She was ultimately saved in many ways by a high school cooking competition and the passion that she found. Cassie\u2019s brother suffered in his life as well and isn\u2019t with us today to tell his story, but we honor him by releasing this story today. For Brandon\u2026.  The song that Cassie chose to represent her journey is\u00A0\u201CGot It In You\u201D by Banners. In honor of her brother Brandon, she shared two songs that he liked.

They may not ever really \u201Creach out\u201D for more and more \u201Cprivileges\u201D in the congregation but just seek to make it through from one day to the next. Matthew was one such JW, trying to get by, trying to make his very serious JW mom happy as a kid, trying to keep his head down and to not be noticed. One day when he had his own children he realized that he couldn\u2019t make them live that same existence that he had and that things had to change.

Now we get to hear her story and she does a really good job of putting it all together and was fun to talk to. She became one of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in her early 30s after a guy that was doing some tree work at her house pitched her and introduced her to his wife for a Bible study. Having recently lost her grandmother and in the middle of grieving, they gave her a hope that she could cling to and that drew her in. This is a story of manipulation from the beginning until the end of her time in the cult. You\u2019ll find out how therapy, and Leah Remini helped her to wake up, and we have some great conversation about finding oneself after leaving.

This is a tough story to listen to and my heart goes out to her but she has overcome a truly traumatic childhood to create a good life for herself. Unlike most people that I interview she was never baptized, but she lived a life as a JW that needs to be told. There are a lot of patterns in this story that are repeated in many families in the organization. Sheltered from real life Nicole was in for some rude awakenings, and unfortunately the most abusive came from her own family. She eventually learned that she could trust nobody but herself.\u00A0  Nicole chose the song\u00A0\u201CEternal Sunshine\u201D by Jhene Aiko\u00A0to represent her journey.

You\u2019ll see through this interview that Adrian was one of those people that had humanity that even the cult couldn\u2019t break. That sensitivity though, the heartbreak of shunning not just once but twice, led to his becoming a heroin addict at a young age. One moment though helped him to break free of it all and to realize that he was responsible for the path his life would take and that nobody he had relied on growing up would help, that the only person he ultimately had was himself, and that he had enough value to be worth living a good life for. You can view more of Adrian\u2019s work on Instagram at xadriantrevorx The song that Adrian chose to represent his journey is\u00A0Stop the Fuckin\u2019 Car by Circa Survive. He was helped by the book Crisis of\u00A0Conscience by Raymond Franz\u00A0and he also mentioned the\u00A0exjw reddit group.

First, we\u2019re talking about a family that goes all the way back to the Rutherford days of the organization. Additionally, Andie was beat up for her beliefs, she was forced to move a lot for a reason that you won\u2019t see coming, and she spent time in Mexico to try to build an English speaking congregation but had to come home for another reason that you won\u2019t see coming. She talks openly about self-harm, about her own horrific rape, living in her car, and thoughts of suicide. Andie was one tough young lady that dealt with a lot and came out the other side. She should be very proud of herself. The song that Andie chose to represent her journey is\u00A0\u201CIf We\u2019re Honest\u201D by Francesca Battistelli.

She was involved in a cult early in her life that, translated from Afrikaans to English, means \u201CThe Chosen People\u201D. As one might imagine in a land where apartheid held strong for so long the cult was definitely racist. Lyla was only involved for a short time and you\u2019ll see why, but it created dynamics that impact her to this day, and set her on a path to try to help Amish youth here in America. This episode features two amazing songs from Lyla. The first that you will here is \u201CNot Coming Home\u201D and the second is \u201CBelow the Surface\u201D.  \u201CNot Coming Home\u201D \u2013 Proceeds go to the Amish Heritage Foundation  \u201CBelow the Surface\u201D by Lyla Illing The song that Lyla chose (by another artist) to represent her journey is\u00A0\u201CRunaway\u201D by Pink.

Dave has been diagnosed in the last few months with ALS, sometimes commonly known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, and he knows that he only has a finite time left in his life. This is truly inspiring story and we talk about a subject that few want to talk about, death. More than that, we talk about life, as death isn\u2019t as scary as never truly living.

Chloe, like so many, lived a double life and ended up getting married young to another JW. Today she shares custody of her daughter with that JW and at my request she provides some really amazing advice for others in that situation. There are a lot of things here that I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll relate to on some level. Special music by\u00A0Secret Cigarettes\u00A0and\u00A0Cats To Whip.

He told the story of his first Christmas in the Facebook group and it was such an amazing story that I had him call in and record it and played it on the show. Nico is one of the youngest guests that I\u2019ve had. He was able to break free from the cult with so much life ahead of him, but the life that he left behind is still fresh and he lost a lot of people that he cared about in the process. In his story you\u2019ll see what kind of person he his, how he tried to live that dub life, and also how things happened that led to him waking up. In fact, there\u2019s a story at the end that involves another person, and I know that you like I will want an update on them. So I have an update for you to share after the interview.

Yolanda faced verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse inside the cult of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, but she comes through with this tough and resilient spirit. Yolanda isn\u2019t officially shunned and we\u2019ve done things to protect her identity. She has become a haven for some shunned people in her local area. Her story needs to be told because it\u2019s indicative of a lot of what goes on behind closed doors inside the organization. They used to talk about a scripture that referred to whitewashed graves that looked nice but held dead men\u2019s bones inside. There is so much in this story that is going on that will show you inside just another JW family, and you\u2019ll see how some things like sexual abuse are perpetuated through the veil of secrecy in their hierarchy.

      "description": "Nicholas was a member of an online ministry that seems to have some hallmarks of a cult called Is, Was, and Will Be. This is a really unique look into how what seems to be a cult can get its hooks in someone that is never even present physically. Imagine getting sucked into an online world where your fellowship is primarily through email chats and a website with information on it. There must be some profound mental games being played. This is a great look into some of them. In fact, I don\u2019t mention it during the interview, but the term gaslighting comes to mind at times.  Teachings seemed to be somewhat misery and suffering based, Nicholas was wrestling with his own sexuality, and in the end the annihilation of the \u201Cself\u201D was something that caused him to be lost for some time. After much trauma therapy Nicholas is on his way back to finding himself again. Resources Mentioned: If you are interested in the coaching/support group opportunity you can sign up\u00A0HERE.

      "description": "This episode features a fascinating interview with someone that was raised in a racist family cult. It was very small, just 14 people or so in actuality, but the teachings of the leader were found online and attracted a lot of alt-right and neo-nazi supporters that were drawn to it. This is a look into the literal life cycle of a cult. It shows how it began, how it eventually came to an end, but how even then the beliefs still linger, which is the power of a cult. Last month\u0027s episode really shined a light on the narcissism present in Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, and this episode shows how one narcissist can impact so many people\u0027s lives, and how narcissism breeds narcissism among the group. We will not be using this guest\u0027s name. She picked a letter to go by so we\u0027ll call her V. I will also not be releasing the name of the cult or the website that was used. We live in a world right now that is more concerned with hunting people down based on what a person said years ago than they are looking at who a person is now. My guest has been impacted in this current climate, where employment can be affected based on affiliation with a thing at one point in a person\u0027s life simply because they were raised in it.\u00A0 I\u0027m not a proponent of outrage culture and I\u0027m not here to cause problems for people.\u00A0 V should be applauded for her present and not punished for her past.\u00A0 She showed bravery and the willingness to be vulnerable in telling us all about her life.

One begins to see others as objects to be controlled, and often becomes tone deaf to the feelings of others around them. Tamara\u2019s story is one that highlights these qualities in those around her. You will learn of her extremely isolated JW upbringing, you\u2019ll see once again that the elders fall short when it comes to dealing with sexual assault, and the pure lack of humanity exhibited by Witnesses when people are in need.\u00A0 Ultimately you\u2019ll see a strong person that escapes all of this, and when I did this interview it had only been months since the end of all of this.\u00A0 So she wasn\u2019t just strong enough to emerge from it all, she was strong enough to speak up so soon and to tell her story.

      "description": "A young girl finds herself in a new life, with new exciting hopes and dreams as part of the cult of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, but with very real fears of doom with a looming Armageddon. This story develops into a young JW marriage fraught with issues that often happen in such relationships. Added to that is a pregnancy followed by postpartum depression, and a spiral that leads into new relationships that ultimately help her wake up to the realities of a life that she was given at such a young age. Lyndi has a Youtube Channel dedicated to helping her JW daughter understand what happened someday. It is called To Shay, and it is a touching tribute to her daughter from a mom that just happens to see things differently now. Here is a link. The song that she chose to represent her journey is \u0022Be Like That\u0022 by 3 Doors Down. A movie that impacted her is called \u0022The Village\u0022. She was helped by the website JWfacts.com And of course, she was helped by the book  Crisis of Conscience, a must read for anyone associated with Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses.

      "description": "In this episode I was able to interview Torah Bontrager, a non-practicing Amish that is the founder of the Amish Heritage Foundation. Torah has been on MTV True Life, the Tim Ferriss Blog, Forbes.com, and the Huffington Post. Her desire is to reclaim the narrative and help tell a more accurate Amish story while working to help those that escape the church. With that said, Torah has her own intense story of escape and she\u0027s managed to create a life that she loves on the other side of that escape. So listen to Torah\u0027s story, learn about Amish culture, and understand more about the experiences of others around you. The song that Torah chose to represent her journey is Heroes by David Bowie, specifically the cover by Iva Davies and Icehouse. You can learn more about Torah Bontrager on her personal website here. You can learn more about the Amish Heritage Foundation here.

      "description": "Sadly no, there is not necessarily any pasta and an Apostafest. What there is constitutes a group of people that have all been shunned by everyone that they ever knew for no longer believing what they once did. How did we get to this place? Listen and see. An apostate is simply a person that no longer follows a particular faith. However, cults like Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses use the term \u0022apostate\u0022 in conjunction with such wonderful terms as \u0022mentally diseased\u0022 in order to brand anyone that disagrees with them unfavorably. So listen to the episode, and if you ever get a chance to attend such an event I\u0027d encourage you to do so. I hope that listening to the stories here help you to see how you would fit in.

This story has cars hidden in the woods for a getaway, living on boats, time spent in rehab, a JW group of \u201Clost boys\u201D that were dealing drugs, just your average story of leaving a cult. You can see that Jason is an explorer, a person driven to learn and try new things, and how stifling it would be growing up in a cult where that is discouraged. He made mistakes after leaving the cult and wants to help others to avoid doing the same. In fact, he\u2019s written a book about his experiences that goes into greater depth than we can do here. You can find his book entitled \u201CWorldly \u2013 How NOT To Leave A Cult\u201D on\u00A0Amazon HERE.

      "description": "One of the hallmarks of growing up as one of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses is that feeling that you\u2019re never \u201Cgood enough\u201D. It drives a lot of the depression seen in the cult, and is often something that people that leave take with them. Imagine if instead of just feeling less than because maybe you aren\u2019t hitting some goal of hours spent knocking on doors or taking care of responsibilities in the congregation that are expected of you the problem was something as personal and natural as your sexuality. In this episode we get an intimate look into what it\u2019s like to be gay growing up as one of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and it\u2019s impact on Fernando, which I\u2019m sure reflects at least parts of the experiences of many others.

Oh, and below is my favorite verse from the Book of Thomas.\u00A0 I told you I\u2019d include it, and I also promised that it was amazing, so I hope you enjoy.\u00A0 Remember, Thomas, like the other Gospel writers, was writing about the life and experiences that he had with Jesus.\u00A0 I wonder why this one wasn\u2019t included in the finished Bible\u2026.. \u201C(114) Simon Peter said to him, \u201CLet Mary leave us, for women are not worthy of life.\u201D Jesus said, \u201CI myself shall lead her in order to make her male, so that she too may become a living spirit resembling you males. For every woman who will make herself male will enter the kingdom of heaven.\u201D\u201D ",

      "description": "At the border of the states of Utah and Arizona lies another world, a community known as Short Creek.\u00A0 A patriarchal world of polygamy with sister wives, where women have few rights, and where certain men have all of the power.\u00A0 This episode is a fascinating look into a world that most will never enter, a world led by a man (Warren Jeffs) that now is serving a life sentence plus twenty years for child sexual assault. A brave woman named Brenda escaped from this community and gives us a detailed view into the life and feelings of those that live in the cult of the FLDS (Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints, a Mormon denomination).\u00A0 This is an intense story of being completely captive to a concept and the struggle for freedom by a woman with a big heart that overcame the lack of freedom over her own body and mind. In addition to this in depth interview, Brenda also has a documentary called \u0022If This Is Heaven, Then Give Me Hell\u0022 on Youtube:  Brenda also has a blog where you can learn more about her and her journey and another blog here. Brenda chose two songs to represent her journey.\u00A0 The first one that she mentioned is the theme song to Enterprise, a song that has a great message that resonates with her journey, but also a show that they enjoyed when they first left the cult. The second song that she chose is Brave by Sara Bareilles. Support Brenda by leaving her a comment HERE Leave us a review on iTunes Support the show by donating to the cause on our Patreon page, Patreon.com/shunned  All music performed by Podington Bear.",

Here are some resources that helped DJ in his path out: The Joe Rogan Experience - Joe interviews fascinating characters and thought leaders to bring their perspectives on living to life. Lloyd Evans\u0027 book  The Reluctant Apostate and his Youtube channel called John Cedars. And last, but certainly not least, the book that every ex-JW should read, from a former leader of the cult himself (Ray Franz), the book  Crisis of Conscience.\u00A0 This book has just recently been re-released to great fanfare in the ex-JW community.
