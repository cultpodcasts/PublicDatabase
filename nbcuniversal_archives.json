      "title": "Jonestown, Guyana - www.NBCUniversalArchives.com",
      "description": "Jim Jones founded the Peoples Temple in Indianapolis in 1956.  Twenty-two years later, on November 19, 1978, he became notorious for leading his congregants in mass suicides in his utopian settlement, known as Jonestown.   918 people - including children -- lost their lives to suicide or were murdered.  Congressman Leo J. Ryan was among them. NBC News reporter Don Harris and cameraman Robert Brown, on the scene covering events, were killed on the airstrip outside of Jonestown.   Much of the footage on Jim Jones and Jonestown Massacre has been assembled into a compilation reel at NBC News Archives.  \n\nTo screen this compilation click here:  http://www.nbcuniversalarchives.com/nbcuni/clip/51A02171_s01.do\n\n\u0022Like Us\u0022 on Facebook http://www.facebook.com/nbcuarchives\n\u0022Follow Us\u0022 on Twitter http://www.twitter.com/nbcuarchives",
