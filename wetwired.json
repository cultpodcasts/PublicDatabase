      "description": "Today we\u2019re looking at the life and prophecies of theosophist, cult leader, and deadbeat dad Edward Arthur Wilson, better known as Brother XII.\n\n\n\nBrother XII was an English occult leader who founded the Aquarian Society and its commune in Vancouver Island, British Columbia in the late 1920s. He was hounded with allegations of abuse, fraud, and even murder. He fled prosecution by burning down his compound and absconding with the group\u2019s gold in a tug boat. Legend has it that what he couldn\u0027t grab is still buried on the island.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re pleased to welcome archaeologist Steph Halmhofer back to the show. Researching Brother XII has been a passion project of hers, and she\u0027s here to tell us about him.\n\n\n\nFollow Steph on Twitter (https://twitter.com/Cult_Archaeo)\n\n\n\n\u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC\n\n\n\nFor $3 a month, listen to the rest of this episode and get an extra few subscriber only episodes every month.

Ballard, taking to heart the conviction that every problem can be solved with a gun, travels to Columbia, to set up his own Epstein island as a sting operation to catch pedophiles. \n\nAlong the way, Ballard, who believes no amount of entrapment is too much, single-handedly manages to dramatically expand the market for pedophiles while almost simultaneously making the Columbian jungle completely unsafe for NGOs.\n\nTim Ballard, one time head of Operation Underground Railroad, an organization that seeks to replicate his Columbian adventure but in other impoverished nations around the world, is now connected to something called the Spear Fund. \n\nSome extra reading:\nhttps://www.vice.com/en/article/4a3apm/anti-trafficking-group-with-long-history-of-false-claims-gets-its-hollywood-moment\nhttps://www.vice.com/en/article/k7z74x/tim-ballard-sound-of-freedom-operation-underground-railroad-stepped-away\nhttps://thespearfund.org/\n\nMusic:\nKevin Hartnell - Tree of Tears (CC BY 4.0)\nGianluca Sgalambro - Prayers (CC BY 4.0)\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nIf you liked this episode, consider supporting us on Patreon.

The show centered on the daily routines and challenges of the religiose Duggars, Jim Bob and Michelle\u2014and their 19 children.\n\nIn 2015, when he was 27 years old, Josh Duggar publicly apologized for molesting five girls, four of whom were his sisters when he was a teenager. The fifth girl was possibly a babysitter for the younger Duggar children.\n\nIn May 2022, Josh Duggar was found guilty on all charges and sentenced to 12 and a half years in prison followed by 20 years of supervised release and will have to register as a sex offender.\n\nWhat happened to Josh Duggar\u2019s victims is absolutely tragic. Though, after looking at his actions and crimes in the context of his upbringing, it\u0027s clear that he didn\u0027t just spring up in a vacuum.\n\nThe Duggars don\u2019t advocate child molestation, but as followers of Bill Gothard, they do subscribe to a number of beliefs that enable it.\n\nBill Gothard, the founder of both ATI and the Institute in Basic Life Principles (IBLP) was born on November 2, 1934. Gothard developed the Basic Youth Conflicts course into the Institute of Basic Youth Conflicts, and then later renamed it the Institute in Basic Life Principles. After trying unsuccessfully to develop a boarding school, in 1984 Gothard created a Christian homeschooling program called the Advanced Training Institute or ATI.\n\nBill Gothard himself was eventually removed from his leadership role at IBLP in 2014 after multiple women came forward with accusations that he had sexually harassed and/or sexually assaulted them. Later, in 2016, a group of 34 women (including all the women from the earlier group) filed a lawsuit alleging the same things and, additionally, that IBLP later tried to cover it up.\n\nMusic:\nAirglow - Innermission (CC-BY-NC-SA)\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0\n\nLucifer\u0027s Child - Fall of the Rebel Angels\n\nSubscribe to listen to the full episode and get more premium episodes:\nhttps://patreon.com/wetwired\n\nCome chat on the Wetwired Discord:\nhttps://discord.gg/fr62mpUy5c\n\nFollow us on Twitter at https://twitter.com/wetwiredpod and Instagram at https://instagram.com/wetwiredpod",

Though, after looking at his actions and crimes in the context of his upbringing, it\u0027s clear that he didn\u0027t just spring up in a vacuum.\n\nThe Duggars don\u2019t advocate child molestation, but as followers of Bill Gothard, they do subscribe to a number of beliefs that enable it.\n\nBill Gothard, the founder of both ATI and the Institute in Basic Life Principles (IBLP) was born on November 2, 1934. Gothard developed the Basic Youth Conflicts course into the Institute of Basic Youth Conflicts, and then later renamed it the Institute in Basic Life Principles. After trying unsuccessfully to develop a boarding school, in 1984 Gothard created a Christian homeschooling program called the Advanced Training Institute or ATI.\n\nBill Gothard himself was eventually removed from his leadership role at IBLP in 2014 after multiple women came forward with accusations that he had sexually harassed and/or sexually assaulted them. Later, in 2016, a group of 34 women (including all the women from the earlier group) filed a lawsuit alleging the same things and, additionally, that IBLP later tried to cover it up.\n\nMusic:\nAirglow - Innermission (CC-BY-NC-SA)\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0\nLucifer\u0027s Child - Fall of the Rebel Angels\n\n\u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC\n\nFor $5 a month, get an extra couple subscriber only episodes every month or so.

      "description": "We\u2019re taking a much-needed hiatus from our summer coverage of the fascists and Christian nationalists to talk about Maitreya Rael, the Last Prophet of the Elohim.\n\nRael, a former pop singer and street musician who had a little success with the song Miel et la Canelle, later founded an auto racing magazine called Autopop. Born Claude Vorilhon, he now leads the International Raelian Movement and claims that today there are more than 130,000 members worldwide. \n\nRael teaches his followers that 25,000 years ago, scientists from a far off planet came to Earth and created all life here as part of a genetic experiment. He claims to have first learned these truths from an extraterrestrial he encountered while hiking in his native France. He also tells his followers that he was later taken to visit that alien\u2019s home world, which they call the Planet of the Eternals. There he encountered firsthand the marvels of their advanced technology. \n\nNotable among their advances are thought projecting helmets, human clone sex robots, and huge computers that are able to constantly monitor every human being on the Earth.\n\nWhile on the Planet of the Eternals, the aliens, who call themselves the Elohim, gave Rael a mission:\n\nSpread the Message of the Elohim and\nBuild the Elohim\u2019s Embassy on Earth according to their specifications.\n\n\u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC\n\nFor $5 a month, get an extra couple subscriber only episodes every month. \n\npatreon.com/wetwired\n\nGet in on the ground floor of the Wetwired Discord.\n\ndiscord.gg/fr62mpUy5c\n\nFollow us on Twitter at twitter.com/wetwiredpod and Instagram at instagram.com/wetwiredpod",

We haven\u0027t talked much about what it looks like from the inside of an evangelical church or what the exit sign looks like.\n\nJesseca is known on TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube as the Queen of Heathens, and she knows a thing or two about evangelical Christianity in the US.

      "description": "As many of you have probably heard, back in August, Andrew Tate, notorious misogynist, failed reality show personality, and conspiracy theorist, had his profiles removed from every mainstream social media platform.\n\nTate, who initially got famous as a champion kickboxer, has been trying and failing for nearly a decade since retiring from combat sports to translate that success into really anything else.\n\nUnfortunately for the rest of us, at least by the way many people measure it, he\u0027s not really failing anymore. In June 2022, from the void of his D list celebrity status, Tate splashed down all over social media.\n\n\u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC \u26EC\n\nFor $3 a month, get an extra couple subscriber only episodes every month.
