      "description": "CONTENT NOTE\nContains discussion of coercion, manipulation, organizational abuse, and victim-blaming. Jack\u0027s direct, confrontational interviewing style may be activating for survivors.\n\nIn Part 2 (of 2), Cara and Jack explore what comes after you recognize harm in a community you loved. Cara shares her two-year journey attempting accountability through mediation\u2014believing transformation was possible, documenting patterns of harm, and slowly realizing the organization wasn\u0027t interested in genuine change. The conversation moves through the stages of disillusionment: from hopeful participant to concerned insider to reluctant whistleblower. Cara reflects on why she stayed in dialogue so long and what it took to finally walk away from the dream of accountability.\n\nJack and Cara discuss the mechanics of institutional betrayal\u2014how organizations respond to harm reports, the ways victims get blamed for their own trauma, and what happens when mediation becomes performance. Cara describes her current work supporting survivors and building alternative models for community and leadership. \n\nPart 2 of 2. For Cara\u0027s full ISTA origin story, start with Part 1.\n\nDISCLAIMER\nViews expressed represent individual opinions and experiences, not official positions of the podcast or producers.

      "description": "What happens when your friend\u0027s shampoo post on Facebook leads to five years in a commercial cult? Anti-MLM activist Julie Anderson joins Cara to trace her journey from desperately seeking work to becoming one of the most recognizable voices exposing multi-level marketing fraud. Julie explains how Monat recruited her through product testimonials, bonuses, and \u0022ignorance on fire\u0022\u2014the MLM term for recruits who don\u0027t understand what they\u0027re actually doing but do it with enthusiasm.\n\nJulie and Cara explore the mechanics of commercial cults: the VIP customer pipeline, and the three-month bonus trap. They discuss how MLMs normalize financial abuse through language control (\u0022it\u0027s your business!\u0022), prosperity gospel, and laws literally written by Amway lobbyists. Julie describes her breaking point\u2014a product that caused suicidal ideation, combined with her father\u0027s sudden death, and realizing she\u0027d hurt people. \n\nContent Note: Contains discussion of suicidal ideation, financial exploitation, and manipulation. Brief mention of grief and family loss.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nViews expressed represent individual opinions and experiences, not official positions of the podcast or producers. Content is not intended to malign any religion, group, organization, business, individual, or entity.\n\nABOUT GUEST\nJulie Anderson spent five years in two commercial cults simultaneously\u2014the multi-level marketing company Monat and the MLM coaching group Rank Makers. After realizing the full scope of what she\u0027d been part of, she turned everything she\u0027d learned about content creation and recruitment into a weapon against the industry itself. For four years, Julie became one of the most recognizable anti-MLM voices online, exposing the mechanics of commercial fraud and helping countless people recognize and exit exploitative schemes.\n\nThis is Julie\u0027s final interview. After nine years of creating content maniacally\u2014five years in, four years speaking out\u2014she has stepped away from social media to rest and heal. Her extensive body of work remains available to help others in the years to come.\nYouTube: https://youtube.com/@JulieAndersonvideos\n\nRESOURCES:\nSafer Sex-Positive and Spiritual Communities: 3SC.Community\nICSA (International Cultic Studies Association): ICSA.org\n\nCONNECT:\nConversations like these helped me get through the darkest times, and I hope they help us get through dark times together. \nIf this episode resonates with you, I\u0027d love to hear from you.\nQuestions or feedback: foolsgoldpodcast@proton.me\nSchedule a 30 min curiosity call with Cara: calendly.com/caracordonicoaching \nSubstack: https://caracordoni.substack.com/\nInstagram: @caracordoni\n\nLike what you\u0027re hearing?

      "description": "What happens when a journalist flips the script? In this episode, writer and comedian Jack Rikess interviews host Cara Cordoni about her journey into and out of The International School of Temple Arts (ISTA). Cara walks Jack through her three ISTA retreats, from the $2,500 promise of transformation to the reality of large group awareness training (LGAT) manipulation\u2014including sleep disruption, psychological pressure, and the dopaminergic highs that feel like enlightenment but can also be induced mania.\n\nJack brings his journalist\u0027s instinct for direct, no-holds-barred questioning (\u0022And what exactly happens with that carrot ritual? \u0022). His style is confrontational but not hostile\u2014he challenges, asks uncomfortable questions about sexuality and polyamory, and isn\u0027t afraid to express his opinion. Together, they find both absurdity and darkness in Cara\u0027s story, exploring how bright people miss obvious red flags and why she initially believed ISTA could be reformed.\n\nTRIGGER WARNING: Contains explicit discussion of sexual practices, manipulation, and coercive group dynamics.
