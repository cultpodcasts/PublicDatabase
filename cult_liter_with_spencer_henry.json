He\u2019d host star-studded parties at his eccentric vacation house. But one summer, Joe discovered that Ike was gone and everything he\u2019d thought he\u2019d known about his neighbor -- and the house next door -- was wrong. From Wondery, the company behind Dirty John and Dr. Death, and Bloomberg, \u201CThe Shrink Next Door\u201D is a story about power, control and turning to the wrong person for help for three decades. Written and hosted by Joe Nocera, a columnist for Bloomberg. The Shrink Next Door is now an Apple Original series, starring Will Ferrell and Paul Rudd.
