      "description": "The Church History Library of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints just dropped a revelatory bomb on the Mormon history community and we\u2019re gunna talk about it. John Taylor (prophet 1880-1887) wrote a revelation saying that the new and everlasting covenant is actually \u201Ceverlasting\u201D and cannot be revoked or abrogated. However, the prophet after Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, wrote the First Manifesto bringing the church into compliance with the law of the land. However, plural marriages continued to be performed. The Reed Smoot hearings turned the eyes of the nation to the kingdom of god in Deseret and every clandestine plural marriage put a lie to the Manifesto. Church leaders are excommunicated and it leads to the formation of the Fundamentalist Latter-day Saints. The church has suppressed this revelation in its vaults for nearly a century while openly denying that it even existed. After that we chat about more secrets hiding in plain sight with the movie National Treasure. We wrap with happy news about diabetes therapy and a gaggle of listener mail.

We take a look at the effects that policy had, the increasingly draconian measures the government is taking, and we read between the lines of Mormon church policies. We also look at the measures people are taking to improve the lives of LGBTQIA\u0026#43;. For Media of Great Price, we watched the lovely 2018 movie Rafiki about two lesbian women in Kenya. And we end with good news out of Paris about a new monument. Happy Pride Month!

      "description": "We\u2019re finishing The God Who Weeps by Terryl Givens and Fiona Givens. This is the first book in a trilogy of Mormon theology and we want to leave room in the year to get through it all. What does today hold for us? We start with a long discussion on the pre-mortal existence, transitioning into existence, then ascending to perfection thanks to Mormon beliefs. We didn\u2019t realize until pretty late in the project that the 5 chapters of the book are structured around the different stages of the Mormon Plan of Salvation (PoS), but it become clear pretty early on in our discussion. All told, the book is a marker of modern orthodox Mormon belief: pray, pay, and obey. They even have an ultra-conservative take on abortion that makes the official stance of the church seem like bleeding-heart liberals in comparison. Then we talk about The Meaning of Life, a Monty Python movie from 1983 that has a much more healthy way of looking at the random cosmic soup that led to human existence. We wrap with some happy news about the success of a slightly higher tax in Massachusetts that raised a bunch of money for all the things for which taxes are used. We round out by going through some delightful listener mail from the April Fools episode!

      "description": "We have a guest for our main segment this time. Chris Shelton is a cult expert content creator who eats, breathes, and sleeps high-demand, coercive groups. We discuss everything from what makes a group a cult, how to identify them, is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints a cult, and proper ways to approach conversations about high-demand groups. Be sure to check out our series collaborating on Chris\u2019s YouTube channel linked below. After that we discuss Don\u2019t Look Up, a 2021 movie about the cult of politics and a major natural disaster that affects everybody across the globe. To wrap up we have a brief chat about a gene-related study on mice and speech patterns before closing out with a review of all our listener mail from the Death Penalty series.

      "description": "It\u2019s time for part 2 of our Death Penalty series! Since this is a Mormon podcast, we first look into the history of Mormons and the death penalty. Joseph Smith and Brigham Young both ordered assassinations and fostered environments where random acts of violence became inevitable. The State of Deseret, Utah, has a comparatively bloody, theocratic history. Then we take a broader view of religion and capital punishment. After that, we look into the ethics/morals of capital punishment and give you a look at the Innocence project. We wrap by discussing your responses from Survey #1 as well as our own viewpoints on the subject. Survey #2: After listening to these episodes, we\u2019d like to hear if your insights or opinions have changed and how. https://forms.gle/Vjn48xzWgCWcJR8r8 Show Notes: Trump v United States: Oral argument on the former president\u2019s immunity claim: https://www.c-span.org/program/public-affairs-event/trump-v-united-states-oral-argument-on-the-former-presidents-immunity-claim/640481 23-939 Trump v United States (7/1/2024) https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf Account of hearing between circa 3 and 9 June 1837 state of Ohio v Joseph Smith for threatening to take life: https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/account-of-hearing-between-circa-3-and-9-june-1837-state-of-ohio-v-js-for-threatening-to-take-life/1#facts Joseph, in the Elder\u2019s Journal, discusses the Kirtland Bank and Warren Parrish and Grandison Newell\u2019s charges against hi: https://bhroberts.org/records/5tcqZf-vSQSfc/joseph_in_the_elders_journal_discusses_the_kirtland_bank_and_warren_parrish_and_grandison_newells_charges_against_him Orson Hyde, Life lessons learned: https://rsc.byu.edu/vol-3-no-2-2002/orson-hyde-life-lessons-learned Danites: https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/topic/danites Danite Manifesto: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Danite_Manifesto The Danite Constitution and Theories of Democratic Justice in Frontier America: https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5074\u0026context=byusq Journal of Mormon History Vol 30, No. 2, 2004: https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1043\u0026context=mormonhistory General Smith\u2019s views of the powers and policy of the government of the United States circa 26 January - 7 February 1844: https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-circa-26-january-7-february-1844/12#full-transcript Journal of Mormon History Vol 33, No 1, 2007: https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1049\u0026context=mormonhistory The Coming Storm: The murder of Jesse Thompson Hartley: https://user.xmission.com/~research/mormonpdf/storm.pdf The wound the never healed: https://www.prestopreservation.com/uploads/5/2/5/3/52533793/morrisite_story_small.pdf Official position on capital punishment of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints: https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/official-statement/capital-punishment The Movement to Abolish Capital Punishment in America 1787-1861: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1847110?read-now=1\u0026seq=8 \u201CCaedite eos.

      "description": "It\u2019s time to start a new year and new book for our long-form deep dive reviews of terrible Mormon books. And this one is\u2026 not terrible? The Givens present a form of Mormon theology which tries to \u201Cmake sense of life\u201D and we\u2019re here for any Mormon theology that doesn\u2019t include discrimination, sexism, and anything holding it over from its past. We dive into the introduction and first chapter of the book. But, what would a book review be without some due diligence about the authors? We spend the first portion talking about Terryl and Fiona Givens, their histories, publishing careers, and try to get a sense for what we can expect throughout this book.

      "description": "BYU and SLC anti-vice. We discuss the history of Charles A. Callis, his career in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and politics, and his final assignment before death, creating a sexual purity surveillance and counseling/therapy program for Mormons in the 40s. After his death, Spencer W. Kimball took the reins and vastly expanded the reach and purposes of the program, resulting in The Miracle of Forgiveness. Cleon Skousen was running raids on gay clubs and anybody else seen as commie enemies of god\u2019s country. The systems they created have adapted, evolved, and conformed to the times, but never gone away, as evidenced by the recent SL Tribue piece about BYU\u2019s retrenchment and culture of fear. Then we chat about Minority report, a Tom Cruise sci-fi flick with surprisingly profound concepts. We wrap with happy news about the first openly transgender congressperson in American history.

      "description": "Part 2 of Episode 150! Yay!! And now for something completely different. This episode is a bit of a departure from our regular show. We invite Alex Criddle and Cody Noconi, researchers into the psychedelic origins of Mormonism, to respond to the recent debate on the Mormon Book Reviews channel between ourselves and Mormon apologist, Brian Hales. Brian attempts to provide the apologetic response to the theory that Joseph Smith utilized psychedelics (entheogens) in the early history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in order to facilitate visionary experiences for the early Saints. Disinformation requires much greater effort than simply stating information so we do our best to debunk his debunking (rebunk the theory?). This one is a long haul so we split it into 2 episodes to make it a little more digestible.

      "description": "Part 1 of Episode 150! Yay!! And now for something completely different. This episode is a bit of a departure from our regular show. We invite Alex Criddle and Cody Noconi, researchers into the psychedelic origins of Mormonism, to respond to the recent debate on the Mormon Book Reviews channel between ourselves and Mormon apologist, Brian Hales. Brian attempts to provide the apologetic response to the theory that Joseph Smith utilized psychedelics (entheogens) in the early history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in order to facilitate visionary experiences for the early Saints. Disinformation requires much greater effort than simply stating information so we do our best to debunk his debunking (rebunk the theory?). This one is a long haul so we split it into 2 episodes to make it a little more digestible.

      "description": "Every General Conference the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announces new temples. We walk through the history surrounding a few of the worldwide temples, along with some of the subtle international political maneuvers necessary to open the door to a new temple project. Wherever the church wants a temple, leaders must curry the favor of local and national politicians and regulators, doing so with no legal oversight. This two-way-street of backscratching opens the way for national security risks. After that we jump into Hugh Nibley\u2019s Approaching Zion where he talks about gifts and laments how much people have to work for money when God provides everything we need. We round out with an update to the USDA guidelines for school food nutritional requirements being improved.

Names like Gazelam, Ahashdah, Pelagoram, Mahalaleel, Mahemson, Shederlaomach, and (most importantly) Talents, all appear concerning the Secret Combination of the United Firm, or United Order. We discuss the history of the names, who\u2019s involved, and why they appear in the first place. Huge thanks to Gene Judson of Latter-daily Digest for inviting us onto the show and suggesting the topic! After that we chat about a movie concerning a secret combination, Hot Fuzz!

      "description": "We did it! We FINALLY did it! After years and years and years of requests from many listeners we have finally taken a look at Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s very first Sherlock Holmes book \u2014 A Study In Scarlet. We look at the time period Doyle was writing it and why he would take on Mormonism in his first book. We also take a look at the impact the story had on how Mormons were treated in film. And since that book is an outsider looking into Mormonism, we decided that for the Media of Great Price segment, we\u2019d look at a film of an insider looking out of Mormonism. Yes, after many listener requests, we watched the shitshow that is the Mormon film 17 Miracles. Following that discussion we cleanse all palate\u2019s with some good news out of the UK about leaving a treaty that allows fossil fuel companies to sue governments. Enjoy your listener request episode!

We take a brief look at the beginnings of the California Gold Rush and how much the Mormons were involved, as well as the battle for control between Bloody Brigham and Samuel Brannan. Which also leads us into Part 1 of our deep dive into Approaching Zion by Hugh Nibley. We discuss the first two essays and show the contortions Hugh Nibley has to make in order to present Bloody Brigham Young as a utopian. And to wash that image from your eyes, we will close out with some fantastic news about, of all things, the most recent Super Bowl and renewable energy. Enjoy!

      "description": "Newest Apostle for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Elder Patrick Kearon, joins replaces M. Russel Ballard in the highest leadership body of the Mormon hierarchy. Who is he, from where does he come (professionally and otherwise), and what does his calling mean for the future of the wealthiest religion in the world? We do an apostolic profile with what publicly-available information can be found about Patrick Kearon, and his wife Jennifer Hulme-Kearon. After that we\u2019re joined by Jen from ExMo Candle Co. to discuss the winner in the Glass Box War for the official Destroying Angel candle. Then we chat about Thank You For Smoking, a movie about propaganda and the power of argumentation through the lens of Big Tobacco (\u2122) and finally we wrap with good news about an across-the-board cost of living increase for minimum wage workers.

Tanner presents a segment on the Kinderhook plates, drawing larger implications for how it disproves other Mormon scripture \u201Ctranslation\u201D claims. Then Will takes us on a journey through reconciling his relationship with his mom through LARPing (Live Action Role Playing) and making his own \u201Ctranslation\u201D of the Kinderhook plates. Then Julie gives us a rundown on the new Barbie movie starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. After that we\u2019re joined by Friend from Serbia (V) to discuss the ongoing situation involving Connexions and its leaders, Jodi Hildebrant and Ruby Franke.

We talk missionaries in Europe, political machinations, President Martin Van Buren, polygamy, the endowment ceremony, Freemasonry, The Book of Abraham, so many other gems! This period of April 1839-April 1842 is one of the most complicated and adaptive periods of Joseph\u2019s ministry and we hold on with the edge of our finger tips as the book rips us through it, hoping we aren\u2019t stopping to smell the shitpiles the book conspicuously ignores along the journey.

      "description": "The conclusion of the Missouri-Mormon war of 1838! Two events which are incredibly infamous in Mormon history, the Haun\u2019s Mill Massacre, and the Liberty Jail stint, feature throughout this episode. But we discuss the context that led to the circumstances and the criminal proceedings that resulted from the war once Joseph Smith and the Mormons had surrendered. While certain figures are vilified for turning against the prophet, we spend a bit more time with those individuals to see what they had to say for themselves.

      "description": "This episode is basically a standalone Saints episode! Why? You may ask. Because the book covers a massive and controversial time of early Mormonism, when Joseph Smith incited a civil war and lost. We compare the Saints book to the documents of the time and see how it shakes out with the following issues: excommunications of Oliver Cowdery, David and John Whitmer, and William W. Phelps, land disputes, The Salt Sermon, the Danites, the Army of Israel, the July 4th Oration, the Gallatin election day brawl, the siege of De Witt, the Mormon depredations and raiding of militia supply depots and stealing a cannon, the Battle of Crooked River, David W. Patten (Captian Fearnought) and his glorious blaze, Thomas B. Marsh and milk strippings, and the Mormon Extermination Order, along with some of the militia movements along the way. There\u2019s more to the story but that\u2019s a little teaser for this reading of Saints: The Standard of Truth, the official history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Then we discuss a sex scandal in the form of a gay witch hunt in the 1890s spearheaded by Rudger Clawson. The case is far more complicated than first blush would indicate and it serves as a case study for how the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has always had fucked up priorities when it comes to sex, gender, and relationships. After that we talk about To Won Foo, Thanks for Everything, a drag queen movie featuring Patrick Swayze and Wesley Snipes.

Pratt are introduced, as are the Partridge family, including 7 and 11 year-old Emily and Eliza. The book casually introduces the subject of polygamy, presumably to smooth over the subject in the coming chapters when the practice becomes more controversial and widespread. We end the segment discussing Ezra Booth and his expose letters after he was excommunicated from the church for speaking out against Joseph Smith. The episode ends with some good news from Minnesota about transgender health care!

We run through the stories of some early African-American members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Their stories are remarkable, their struggles real, their histories vague but inspiring. We try to place their stories within the larger context of slavery in Utah and what life might have been like at the time. Thank you to Century of Black Mormons project at the University of Utah for creating a wonderful resource with biographies of these historical figures. After that, we go through the 2000 movie, Remember the Titans (mighty, mighty, ti-tans!) and discuss how this football movie isn\u2019t really a football movie at all, but a movie about racism. Then we wrap with happy news about the recent SEC filing which charged the Mormon church with hiding assets and unfair investment practices.

We hone in on the element of \u201CInformation\u201D control within the larger BITE model to discuss how important controlling information is to the longevity of any cult. That leads us into our longer segment where we finally begin our review of Saints: The Standard of Truth, the new authoritative history book of early Mormonism published by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Part 1 discusses the early history of the Joseph Smith family, the supernatural visitations, the acquisition of the Gold Plates, and the authorship process of the Book of Mormon. Does this book cross the threshold of being New Mormon History, or is it simply a more sophisticated treatment of the same Old Mormon History? Yes, this segment is long, but mining mountains for minute morsels is a tedious task. We wrap with some happy news about repurposing defunct oil wells for green energy.

      "description": "Who even is Lavina Fielding Anderson?! In this classic deep dive we examine the life of Lavina Fielding Anderson and her contributions to the Mormon academic field. Her story serves as a case study of how far individuals can pressure the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from the inside before the institution\u2019s immune system responds. She\u2019s a powerhouse of a scholar, a pioneer in feminist Mormon studies, and an advocate for those who\u2019ve survived ecclesiastical abuse. The Mormon Alliance was the organization Lavina formed with Janice Allred to collect and publish survivor\u2019s stories and advocate on their behalf. Both suffered gruelling and abusive disciplinary processes for their advocacy attempting to reform Mormon practices and policies. History repeats itself and the timeline of Protect LDS Children and Sam Young was telegraphed by the experiences of Anderson, Allred, and the Mormon Alliance. We finish the episode with a review of Erin Brockovich and a happy environmental news item from Liverpool. Correction: At about an hour and a half in, Shannon referenced Victor Frankl when she meant Elie Wiesel.

      "description": "It\u2019s finally time for our long-awaited deep dive into New Mormon History. Put simply, NMH was a movement within the history department of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to confront controversial history and turn away from the apologetic and polemical Old Mormon History. The leading figure, Leonard Arrington, was the right person for the job. But, he didn\u2019t have the business chops to fight forces much larger than him in the form of Mark E. Petersen, Ezra Taft Benson, and Boyd K. Packer. The main segment is long as we chronicle the rise, fall, and resurrection of the New Mormon History movement and how the Joseph Smith Papers Project, as well as Saints: The Standard of Truth, are both the results of this movement pushing the church for academic legitimacy. In retrospect, Arrington is vindicated as an intellectual fighting for intellectual integrity while Packer spins in his grave. Then we discuss Finding Forrester as another example of the never-ending fight for academic honesty. We wrap with happy news of an invention set to tackle microplastics in our oceans.

      "description": "Education is a battleground for the hearts and minds of the future. The Church Education System of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was founded in 1980, but the history of education in Mormonism is far more complex. We do a deep dive into how the CES started and the sordid pasts of the various educational institutions attached to the Church at some point. There\u2019s also a tangential deep dive into seminary and the legal sphere of \u201Creleased time\u201D classes carving out exemptions where religion can be taught in public schools. Then we discuss the modern battlefield of public education by reviewing the 2012 documentary, The Revisionaries, focused on public school text books and the fight at the Texas Board of Education. We round out with a quick overview of the best news of our lifetime, recommendations by the Jan 6th Committee to criminally indict the former POTUS for the violent insurrection at the federal capitol building in January 2021.

      "description": "Our long-awaited deep-dive deconstruction of Adam-God Doctrine, or theory, depending on who you ask. What is it? Who taught it? Why is it controversial? How is it treated by the corporate Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints today? \u2018As we are, god once was, as god is we may someday become\u2019 is a tried-and-true Mormon doctrine and the Adam-Eve-Gods Doctrine fits perfectly within this logical loop. As the title of the doctrine alludes to, Heavenly Father took the form of Adam with one of his wives, Heavenly Mother Eve, to create and populate the earth, after which he went to Adam-ondi-Ahman, in Missouri, where he ascended back to godhood to continue his charge from Elohim to create worlds without end. Then we dive into the nearly-final segment of Bruce R. McConkie\u2019s Millennial Messiah. McCranky loves the idea of fire burning the sinners and his charged language justifies the physical suffering and burning of anybody who isn\u2019t Mormon or living its dictates. Further, when Jesus returns to reign in the millennium he will rule with an iron rod; the future dystopian Mormon theocracy is a dangerous and unforgiving land. How all these teachings pervade Mormon culture to this day can be seen by Mormons periodically carrying out the will of gods by causing the suffering and death of sinners and those who oppose the kingdom of God. Mormonism creates dangerous men, yet the church never suffers the repurcussions. We round out the episode with some happy news about cannabis legislation heading to President Biden\u2019s desk.

McConkie\u2019s Millennial Messiah where he continues to harp on his favorite topic, the end times. Turns out the book title is very revealing of the subject matter.

Then, because we know you just can\u2019t get enough of McCrankie, Shannon will give the 5th segment of Millennial Messiah which, surprise surprise, is all about the death and destruction that is going to happen in the second coming. Then we actually will end the episode leaving you with a feeling that the world isn\u2019t completely on fire with some really cool news about green infrastructure. So fasten your seatbelts.

      "description": "Finally, the long-awaited deep-dive of Paul H. Dunn! Dunn was a General Authority of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and a consummate liar. He tweaked or fabricated dozens of stories with a spiritual bend which caused Mormons to feel the spirit that what he was saying was true. He also committed financial fraud by cashing in on his high church rank and grandiose public personality. When all this came to light, shelves of believing Mormons came crashing down worldwide, and he was sent to a pasture up north by the apostles. He was, however, successfully insulated by church leadership from any legal repercussions. After that we review Plan 10 From Outer Space, a 90s Mormon sci-fi flick! We round out the episode highlighting the newly created 3-digit number for mental health resources.

Before that, however, we\u2019re doing a deep-dive into the history of the BYU center in Jerusalem. We discuss how it came to be, the hurdles overcome, and the strange and mysterious ways in which Mormon God works. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints punched far above its weight class in the sphere of international politics to shoehorn this place onto the Mount of Olives! Then we round out the episode with some happy news about scrap wood being used more sustainably.

How can it be used for benevolent or, conversely, malevolent, purposes? Why is music easier to remember than just about any other media we create or consume? We also discuss some history of hymns and folk music in the Mormon culture and tradition as markers for significant events or used to ensure conformity or battle public perceptions.

This launches us into the next installment of the Millennial Messiah by Bruce R. McConkie. He talks about the endtimes as well, along with the role of the Book of Mormon. The final chapter we cover he leans deep into the white supremacy of Mormon theology. Be prepared, because we weren\u2019t. Then we wrap the show with an op-ed in the Salt Lake Tribune from a long-time listener and patron, Dave Winslow, about the problems with violent rhetoric coming from the leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

      "description": "We examine the fascinating era of the 1970s feminist Mormon history studies. We focus on the central figure of Claudia Bushman and her push to build a non-existent world within Mormon studies. A group of east-coast women scholars began publishing controversial history in the form of Mormon Sisters and the resulting Exponent II quarterly journal. The official church historian, Leonard J. Arrington, encouraged and assisted where he could, but the General Authorities, especially Ezra Taft Benson, Mark E. Petersen, and Boyd K. Packer, couldn\u2019t handle the prospect of women scholars publishing in academic journals about Mormon women\u2019s issues. The retaliation, blacklisting, and PR fights quickly followed Claudia Bushman, Marueen Ursenbach Beecher, and Laurel Thatcher Ulrich as they worked to advance the burgeoning field. After that we review the movie/book Hidden Figures and discuss the new White House Press Secretary!

It\u2019s a long listen, but hearing us dissect #GenCON is much, much, MUCH better than actually watching the 10 hours for yourself, right? This episode has a general content warning as there are talks involving some damaging concepts including death of a child, suicide, and, of course, LGBTQ\u0026#43; issues because those mormon leaders just won\u0027t stop being bigots. So fasten your seatbelts. It\u2019s going to be a bumpy night!

      "description": "It\u2019s time to break into our next long-form review of Mormon literature; Bruce R. McConkie\u2019s Millennial Messiah! We get an idea for the purpose and objective of the book as well as McCrankie\u2019s pet issues right off the bat. He speaks of the heresies integral to false prophecy and warns of the various movements and political groups are anti-Christ. But before we crack open the spine of this tome, our main segment is a brief deep-dive into Mormon prophecy. What is it? From where does it come? How reliable are Mormon prophecies and can they be trusted? And the greatest question with which some believers may wrestle, what\u2019s Joseph Smith\u2019s batting average? We round out the show with some happy news about government diversity in Portugal!

      "description": "One of the most influential leaders of the modern Mormon church, Bruce R. McConkie, made a name for himself with his seminal 1958 work Mormon Doctrine, an encyclopedia of Mormon doctrine and theology. It immediately made waves in the community and the rest of the leadership decided to censor McConkie and the book was pulled from the shelves. With significant edits to address leadership complaints, the book was republished in 1966 and again massively edited and published in 1979 after the priesthood ban was lifted. We explore the life of Bruce McConkie and discuss the impact of Mormon Doctrine and McConkie, as well as the reasons for censure and highlighting necessary edits to tone the book down. Yes, this is the deep-dive on Bruce McConkie and Mormon Doctrine you\u2019ve been waiting for and this episode launches us into our next long-form book review of Millennial Messiah by Bruce McConkie!

Today we go through a brief deep dive into this fascinating figure. He became a close friend and then personal greatest enemy of Joseph Smith throughout a complicated sequence of events. Bennett is most renowned for his 1842 expose, The History of the Saints, which he wrote after his abrupt removal from all church, government, and military appointments. We deal with the charge that he was providing abortions and what the implications which follow actually mean. After that we review Reign of Fire, a Christian Bale and Matthew McConaughey dragon movie with surprisingly deep interpretations.

They suffered the wrath of withering public ire, but their story is immortalized as emblematic of the struggle for racial justice and equality in the 1960s and 70s. Join us as we learn their story and discuss Brigham Young University\u2019s fight to keep discriminating when it became illegal to do so. After that we discuss Small Foot, a movie about asking questions and breaking out of the shell in which people are raised.

      "description": "Our main segment features a piece done by NPR on their Hidden Brain podcast a few years ago. We discuss the type of mindset people need in order to be influenced for various purposes. Hope and fear feature in informing the mindset of a receptive brain when facts simply aren\u2019t enough. After that we get into the next segment of The Miracle of Forgiveness by Spencer W. Kimball. We read a couple of the most infamous passages from the book including the level of sin assessed on survivors of sexual assault and the implication that those who choose to end their own lives are unforgivable. This is a heavy segment but we lighten it up with some fun and a poetic reading by Shannon from the book. We finish the episode with happy news about black Santas!

We begin with a vicious anti-Mormon story about Henry Caswell (Caswall) and the Greek Psalter incident in Joseph Smith\u2019s Nauvoo church. Hugh Nibley considered this one of the longest-running anti-Mormon stories and spent a good deal of print trying to debunk it (unsuccessfully I might add). Then we talk a Nic Cage movie from 2000, Gone in 60 Seconds because why the hell not. Then we wrap up with some happy news about recent cannabis legislation. Next few episodes are going to be pretty heavy so we wanted to keep things light and fun today.

Then it\u2019s off to the next segment of Miracle of Forgiveness. Spence tells us about repenting or perishing, abandoning sin, and awakening to sins we\u2019re committing. He also spends some time justifying the holocaust and genocide of Native Americans after which he commits egregious sins against founding member of the church, Oliver Cowdery.

      "description": "A whole episode about Ezra Taft Benson and Cleon Skousen! We invite Dr. Matt Harris, author of the recent \u201CWatchman on the Tower; Ezra Taft Benson and the Making of the Mormon Right\u201D along with friend of the show, Joseph Geisner, to discuss the life and influences of Mormon Prophet, Ezra Benson. A product of the red scare and McCarthyism, Benson rose to prominence as Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s Secretary of Agriculture and continued to gain status as a radical right-wing conspiracy theorist general authority, eventually becoming prophet of the church in 1985. Arguably, no other individual has had more influence making Mormonism a conservative religion than Benson himself. Please pick up a copy of Matt\u2019s book from Benchmark Books here: https://www.benchmarkbooks.com/ or ring them up and have them send you a copy at 801-486-3111. After that, we do our next installment of Cleon Skousen\u2019s \u201CThe Naked Communist\u201D with added context from the interview. Then we round out the show with some happy news about high early-voter turnout during our important 2020 election.

We jump right in with a discussion about the most recent headlines sparked by the protests following George Floyd\u2019s death. A lot of legislation has been crafted in response to the protests, including an executive order from President Donald Trump. We examine the organizations he listed during the signing to determine the intent of the order, followed by looking at the text of the order itself. Once created, tools can be used for good and evil. Then we discuss CHOP, the occupation movement in Capitol Hill, Washington. The Seattle City Council crafted resolutions in response to the leverage held by the CHOP protestors joined by protests across the nation. Seattle chose to ban the use of chokeholds, riot control weapons, and officers covering their badge numbers. We weigh in on #DefundPolice and how useful it can be in sparking a conversation, but why does the \u201Cdefunding\u201D stop at police? Then we finally tackle the Mormon angle by examining the recent rulings in the Supreme Court concerning churches being \u201Cnon-essential\u201D services and LGBTQ\u0026#43; people actually being people with Title VII protections. We wrap the episode with some great media for understanding racism in America as well as coming out as gay to your family.

How do Elders A and B cope with being on a sales force for a product they know isn\u2019t real? They offer a window into the day-to-day life of missionaries stuck in the world of lockdowns while trying to be good people in spite of being missionaries. After that we dive into part 4 of Tad R. Callister\u2019s Case for the Book of Mormon: how to gain a personal testimony of the Book of Mormon. Can we be done with this book yet?!

      "description": "2019 in review! We read through the recent Jana Riess article about the most significant Mormon headlines of 2019 and discuss some highlights. Then we make predictions for what we might expect in 2020 and also what we\u2019d REALLY like to see in 2020 regardless of how probable they might be. Then we do our next segment of The Case for the Book of Mormon by Tad R. Callister concerning evidence for a historical Book of Mormon. We wrap up with a happy news story about a church in St. Louis paying off thousands of people\u2019s medical debts (yes, we have those in America). We finish off the episode with a bit of listener mail resulting from our Mormon Money series.

      "description": "Today\u2019s show centers around an interview with an anonymous person sharing her story of the Mormon welfare system. She\u2019s currently undergoing a divorce and found out in court the church has been paying her estranged husband\u2019s car and mortgage payments, over $18,000, for the past year on accounts bearing her name without her knowledge. When our interviewee attempted to find more information about the financial support for divorce and tax reasons, she was stonewalled by local leadership. She ran up the ranks to find more information only to be stonewalled by a senior attorney at Kirton-McConkie the primary law firm for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Her story is incredible and reveals a troubling aspect of the church welfare program; there are simply no checks and balances available to members when they suspect abuse or misappropriation of funds related to fast-offering funds from the Mormon Church.

      "description": "$100 billion (yes\u2026 with a \u201CB\u201D) is a lot of money for the church to be hoarding. Unfortunately, the media coverage has been inaccurate in many regards and has missed some of the larger issues contained in the expose \u201CLetter to an IRS Director\u201D by Lars Neilsen. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has become so wealthy and powerful it seems to simply operate by its own set of rules. The size of Ensign Peak Advisors (EPA) is larger than the media has discussed and the alleged violations regarding its disbursements to City Creek Center and Beneficial Financial Group (totally $2 billion) could threaten its tax-exempt status. Also included in the expose is the whistleblower discussing with EPA director, Roger Clarke, \u201Cworst practices\u201D which included \u201Cdeleting receivables\u201D and opening the way for \u201Cdark money\u201D payouts EPA made to unknown entities. The actual portfolio by Nov 2019 is estimated to be closer to $124 billion. We discuss a bit of the media coverage and wrap up with talking about how the church should use that money, could use that money, and how we\u2019d use that money. $124 billion is hard to conceptualize but we try our best.

      "description": "Wheeew what a doozey! We cover Mormon Money from the 1930s to the 1980s. When this much money gets involved and a church grows to have a significant international presence, money begets politics and politics feed money. Once Franklin S. Richards died another needed to carry the Mormon Money torch; here enters Henry Dinwoodey Moyle, a man with grand ideas and exponential growth intentions. He rolls out new missionary programs, local \u201Cbaseball baptisms\u201D sports leagues, carbon copy chapels, the new 28-story Church Office Building, and a litany of other aggressive expansion programs. After bankrupting many companies and chewing through untold resources, Moyle died leaving the church $32 million in debt but on a good path toward global expansion. N. Eldon Tanner, with the help of Marion Romney, takes the helm of Mormon Money and rights the sinking ship by filling leadership with more businessmen and lawyers than ever before. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also began to gain a national political foothold with George Romney running for President and subsequently being appointed Nixon\u2019s HUD Secretary. Gordon B. Hinckley is brought in as Tanner\u2019s protege to take the Mormon Money colossus rampaging across the planet. Part 3 will discuss the recent revelations concerning the church\u2019s $100 billion in holdings and Ensign Peak Advisors.

Mormon money is one of the most complicated subjects associated with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and we decided it requires a multi-part series to understand with some level of depth and context. Join us for part one where we start at the beginning with Joseph Smith, get into Brigham Young and the Mormon exodus to Utah in 1847, and tie together financial strands all the way into the Great Depression. Some topics of discussion: Joseph Smith as an entrepreneur, Brigham Young as a theocrat and tyrant, polygamy and the first manifesto under President Wilford Woodruff, complicated finances with intermingling the prophet\u2019s personal with the church\u2019s corporate assets, Joseph F. Smith and the church in near-bankruptcy he inherited in 1901, Franklin S. Richards and his rehabilitation program, the Corporation of the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (COP), The Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (CPB), and the trajectory upon which the church was set going into the Great Depression.

Braden and I also talk about a new documentary and discuss The Teachings of Don Juan. Then we round out the episode with a climate initiative in India.

We talk about the tough paradoxes introduced when institutionalized theological racism comes into conflict with an ever-expanding global religion.

A few months later, Russell Nelson stated it was actually \u201Crevelation\u201D born by 15 witnesses. This was before he was called as president of the church.

We tie a few stories together to figure out what the church is planning with a recent $2 million investment into the International African American Museum in South Carolina.

We take a brief high-level overview of how non-white people have been treated throughout the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Even though the Priesthood ban was lifted in 1978, racism didn\u2019t go anywhere. From overt examples of prophets advocating slavery, to covert and insidious racism pervading our everyday lives, if we don\u2019t talk about it it\u2019ll never stop being a problem. We wrap with talking about 12 Years a Slave and an initiative in New Orleans to curb homelessness in the wake of hurricane Katrina.

Joe walks us through nearly 80 years of Mormon history discussing disunity among General Authorities and censorship of General Conference addresses. As we broach more modern General Authorities we discuss how the modern conservative bend of the Mormon church was moved and shaped by prominent figures in the Quorum of Apostles. Ezra Taft Benson and the John Birch Society are the focus for a substantial part. Then Joe documents the lengths the Church will go to cover up controversial opinions from the pulpit, even going so far as to retape a portion of General Conference with a superimposed \u201Ccough track\u201D at the cost of $10-15,000.
