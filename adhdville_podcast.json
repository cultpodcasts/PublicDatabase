      "description": "Welcome back to ADHDville, where distractions are landmarks and the details are the main roads! This week, we\u2019re diving into a wild and unexpected topic: ADHD and cults. Why? Because when you\u2019ve got a brain that craves novelty, structure, and belonging, cults... or at least cult-like dynamics, can sometimes feel weirdly tempting. From authoritarian leaders to dopamine-fueled devotion, we\u2019ll explore why neurodivergent minds might be both susceptible to cults and the first to spot the red flags and bail. Plus, we\u2019ll share our own bizarre cult-adjacent experiences (including plastic cups, graveyard confessions, and a surprise cameo from P. Diddy\u2019s producer). So grab your barley coffee or green tea... we\u2019re heading into the bunker for this one. Let\u2019s go!",
