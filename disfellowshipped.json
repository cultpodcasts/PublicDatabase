      "description": "In this powerful conversation, Jeron opens up about his life-long journey with the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2014from growing up in the religion to leaving, returning, and ultimately exposing what he saw as corruption from within. We\u2019re going to share raw, honest reflections on our personal experiences with elders, the appointment process, and what it means to truly be led by the Holy Spirit.\n \n\nIn this discussion:\n \u2022 Child abuse cover-ups and the Australian Royal Commission\u2019s findings\n \u2022 Contradictions in JW teachings, including \u201Cnew light\u201D and doctrinal changes\n \u2022 The decline in JW membership and controversial policies like the blood transfusion ban\n \u2022 Challenges in retaining young members in the internet age\n \u2022 The shift in governing body policies (like allowing beards) and what it means\n \u2022 The emotional toll of being shunned by family and the power of authenticity over religious conformity\n \u2022 The commitment to helping others question, research, and heal from high-control religious environments\n\nWhether you\u2019re a current or former Witness\u2014or just curious\u2014this video invites thoughtful dialogue about truth, self-discovery, and the courage to walk away from control in pursuit of freedom and authenticity. I truly hope this helps someone to eventually be \u201CFreed From Cult Life\u201D.\n\nSubscribe to Jeron\u2019s channel here: https://youtube.com/@jeron_benton?si=If6fS_lDPx_DSY_Q\n\nFeel free to comment, like and share with someone who may need it.

      "description": "For almost ten years, I lived behind bars\u2014but that didn\u2019t stop me from preaching. As a devoted Jehovah\u2019s Witness, I continued to share the religion\u2019s teachings with fellow inmates, convinced I had the truth. Prison didn\u2019t wake me up. I studied the information from Watchtower religiously! The indoctrination was so strong that even in one of the harshest environments, I remained loyal to the organization. After my release, I got married and continued as a Jehovah\u2019s Witness\u2014until I was disfellowshipped. And that was the moment everything started to change.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in Part 1: \u201CGrowing up as one of Jehovahs Witnesses\u201D here\u2019s the link: https://youtu.be/FjlxFko8ADI?si=vQb5T7R3JbgWyybU\n\n\nThanks for taking time to listen to my story and I hope it helps you in some way.
