      "description": "Take a journey with me as I start to share my experiences growing up as one of JW\u2019s. In this brief video, I discuss a couple of the main reasons I decided that this organization is corrupt and dangerous to children. \n\nForgive me for the abrupt ending. I am learning how to make videos, so please bear with me on the editing lol.\n\nIn future videos I\u2019ll dive into my experiences and how JW\u2019s has affected my life. \n\nPlease comment below on your reasons for leaving and thank you for watching.",
