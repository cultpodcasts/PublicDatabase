      "description": "For almost ten years, I lived behind bars\u2014but that didn\u2019t stop me from preaching. As a devoted Jehovah\u2019s Witness, I continued to share the religion\u2019s teachings with fellow inmates, convinced I had the truth. Prison didn\u2019t wake me up. I studied the information from Watchtower religiously! The indoctrination was so strong that even in one of the harshest environments, I remained loyal to the organization. After my release, I got married and continued as a Jehovah\u2019s Witness\u2014until I was disfellowshipped. And that was the moment everything started to change.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in Part 1: \u201CGrowing up as one of Jehovahs Witnesses\u201D here\u2019s the link: https://youtu.be/FjlxFko8ADI?si=vQb5T7R3JbgWyybU\n\n\nThanks for taking time to listen to my story and I hope it helps you in some way. See you on the next video.\n\n#exjw #jehovahswitnesses #prison #indoctrination",

Or why so many changes to doctrines and beliefs that don\u2019t make any sense. \nAsk yourself: Could this be a business being ran? \nAm I in this because of the people I\u2019m close too? \nDo I really believe this so called paradise is really gonna come in my lifetime? \nWhy so many changes? Are they just trying to keep members active?\n\nBe objective. Use critical thinking skills. Be honest.\n\nLike, comment and share please. \n\nWake up!!!",
