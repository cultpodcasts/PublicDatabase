      "description": "Hey welcome back! \nIn this video, I just want those who affiliated with Jehovahs witnesses to just ponder for a moment on WHY they believe the continuous lie that Armageddon is on the horizon. Or why so many changes to doctrines and beliefs that don\u2019t make any sense. \nAsk yourself: Could this be a business being ran? \nAm I in this because of the people I\u2019m close too? \nDo I really believe this so called paradise is really gonna come in my lifetime? \nWhy so many changes? Are they just trying to keep members active?\n\nBe objective. Use critical thinking skills. Be honest.\n\nLike, comment and share please. \n\nWake up!!!",

      "description": "Take a journey with me as I start to share my experiences growing up as one of JW\u2019s. In this brief video, I discuss a couple of the main reasons I decided that this organization is corrupt and dangerous to children. \n\nForgive me for the abrupt ending. I am learning how to make videos, so please bear with me on the editing lol.\n\nIn future videos I\u2019ll dive into my experiences and how JW\u2019s has affected my life. \n\nPlease comment below on your reasons for leaving and thank you for watching.",
