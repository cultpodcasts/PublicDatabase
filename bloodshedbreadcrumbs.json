      "description": "In this episode, we peel back the layers of Jim Jones and the tragedy of Jonestown\u2014tracing how a charismatic preacher transformed a movement for justice into one of the deadliest cult catastrophes in modern history. Through survivor accounts, archival audio, and a clear-eyed look at the psychology of control, we follow the path from Indiana revival tents to a remote Guyanese jungle where over 900 lives were lost. This is the story of belief, manipulation, and the devastating cost of unchecked power.\n\nSupporters Club: https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/bloodshed-breadcrumbs--6711032/support\nFacebook: https://tinyurl.com/mryhyx8s\nPayPal: paypal.me/andrea123171\nCashApp: $reinventingandrea2\nIntro Music: Courtesy of Pixabay.com",
