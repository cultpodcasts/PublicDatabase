      "description": "In this video, Shannon, an ex-cult member and current mental health counselor, discusses an alleged cult that you may not have heard about yet. \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have been following the many allegations, you may know about Daystar, Joni Lamb, Perry Stone, or the number of other mega churches who are now being exposed, here\u2019s another to add to that list.\n\nThe \u201Cchurch\u201D and \u201Cministry school\u201D I discuss here is run by yet another from the \u201Cname it and claim it,\u201D era, a religious singer and \u201Cminister\u201D named Karen Wheaton who runs The Ramp in Hamilton, Alabama. Karen is close friends with Perry Stone (who has had allegations of SA, and been investigated for fraud) as well as Joni Lamb (the head of Daystar with allegations of not reporting SA of a child). \n\nAll of these \u201Cleaders\u201D have a surprising amount of both money, and abuse allegations. They also have something else in common\u2026\u2026.an inability to take accountability and repent.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nShannon was a member of a small trickle down cult that was based out of Russellville, AR from 2007-2021. This cult modeled themselves after The Ramp, which she attended several times, and followed their teachings, as her cult leaders idolized and wanted to be just like them. Her ex-cult leaders are now living in Hamilton, and are deeply involved in The Ramp.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLearn more:\n\nPerry Stone and Joni Lamb by visiting @theunction220  on YouTube, @JulieRoysReport  follow our cult story exposing The Ramp @GodComplexshow  on youtube.

This cult\u0027s leaders now live in Hamilton, Alabama working alongside The Ramp. \n\nAll claims are alleged and have not been proven in court. However, there are hundreds of examples from multiple members that back up these claims.\n\nWe must put an end to religious abuse, and taking advantage of teens and children who are vulnerable. We need to put a stop to the \u0022troubled teen\u0022 industry.\n\nTo learn more about allegations about The Ramp:\nYoutube: @GodComplexshow \nTiktok:\n@joeytrieb @thestephenwomack @jennysjourney0 \n@iamnotrosieo @epistemiccrisis\nFacebook: Stephen Womack",
