      "description": "Shawn met Mark and Leslie Dollar while in college, and sought a place where he could connect and help others. \n\nLike many who were entrapped by Mark and Leslie, it started off positive. But as time passed, it became clear that abuse was occurring. Shawn suffered verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse, and watched even more occur. Shawn is yet another member of this organization who was told to lie to the department of human services about rules that were not being followed. He saw students being degraded and made fun of. He saw contradictory behavior to what was being taught. He saw questionable treatment towards students and young adults.\n\nThough there is a growing number of survivors, and those being interviewed, many still support Mark and Leslie, and refuse to believe any of our allegations. \n\nMore interviews coming soon.\n\n#strange #true #truecrime #weird #cult #story #mystory #podcast #expos\u00E9 #documentary",

It\u0027s important that we continue to share truth about \u0022troubled teen\u0022 industries, religious abuse, and mistreatment.

      "description": "Updates on my investigation into my ex-cult leaders Mark and Leslie Dollar, who operated in Russellville, Arkansas from 2003-2021 under the guise of generous ministers to \u0022troubled teens,\u0022 and who are now operating in Hamilton, Alabama with The Ramp \u0022ministries.\u0022\n\nFor years, survivors have been denied the truth, that we suffered abuse of all kinds at the hands of Mark and Leslie, as well as other predators. Now we are coming together and coming forward with our allegations. There are around 47 survivors in our private group as well as many more coming forward all the time. This does not even include others impacted, such as parents and families.\n\nThe most disturbing allegations and findings yet seem to show that Mark and Leslie kept a predator on their board for years after learning of abuse, because he was a wealthy donor.\n\nConsistent patterns are arising as we cover their entire timeline operating their ex-cult/ministry \u0022Adullam Youth Outreach.\u0022 I will continue to share more survivor stories. Upcoming will also be discussions between myself and two other survivors who also went on to become mental health professionals. We will discuss common questions that survivors get, and problems faced.\n\nI will be taking a few weeks break, and updating with shorter videos if needed before releasing another interview.\n\n#theramp #theramphamilton #investigation #religiousabuse #religioustrauma #cultstory #cults #cultsandextremebeliefs #weirdandtrue #mentalhealthcounselor #podcast #isurvivied #survivor #conartist #ongoinginvestigation #ongoingstories #advocacy #russellvillearkansas #hamiltonalabama",

      "description": "Brook was left with no other option than to rely on others after finding herself facing homelessness, before she had even graduated from high school, in 2013.\n\nShe met Mark and Leslie Dollar through a church, and ended up utilizing their seemingly kind offer to come and live on their property. Having no other option, she had to accept. Unfortunately, she did not find any more safety or refuge while living with them than she found in any other situation she had been in.\n\nSome may argue that Mark and Leslie helped these young people. I am not above stating that they did indeed offer shelter and precisely THREE basic meals a day (no snacks provided). However, this can be true, and the fact that they abused and exploited these young people, is also true at the same time. Abuse occurred. Full advantage was taken of these young people. \n\nBrook experienced this abuse, as well as various inappropriate moments, while living with Mark and Leslie Dollar from age 18-22. Not only did Mark have a disturbingly close attachment to her, even making fun of his own wife to her, but she also experienced scary behavior from other boys that seemed to be encouraged by Mark. Mark continued to text her years after she left.\n\nIn addition, everything she did was controlled. Leslie threatened to take away Brook\u2019s vehicle, and also called her a slut and a whore, for not wanting to change jobs at their orders. Most adults were forced to work at the same location, just as the children were all forced to go to the same school, or later on, the same \u201Cpost education,\u201D The Ramp. Leslie constantly belittled Brook, as she has done others, usually calling her a slut and a whore.\n\nAs a reminder, Mark and Leslie Dollar abused dozens, if not a hundred, teens, before moving on to where they now work and associate, The Ramp, in Hamilton, Alabama, under Karen Wheaton. They are still using young people and teens for financial gain to this day.\n\nFind the podcast they were on that is suspicious as hell on Youtube \nWhat\u0027s Next God?

Unfortunately, some of those who pretend to offer safety and refuge are, in fact, abusive behind the scenes. \n\nMark and Leslie are yet another example of abuse in Dillon\u0027s childhood. Allowing untrained \u0022leaders\u0022 to decide punishment, humiliating him publicly for confessions made in private, and then further humiliating him by completely forgetting his birthday...meanwhile telling others how much of a \u0022family\u0022 they are offering these children.\n\nFortunately for Dillon, he was able to build a good life for himself and other children. He did not, \u0022come out with issues because he went in with issues...\u0022 He came out with additional trauma and abuse, and he then overcame it.\n\n#theramp #theramphamilton #hamiltonalabama #russellvillearkansas #arkansas #christiannews #cults #cultstory #mystory #speakup #religiousabuse #religioustrauma #cultsandextremebeliefs #strange #dark #cultmembers #sharingstories #cultstories #excultmember #podcast",

She had to leave by basically taking her things and leaving without telling anyone. By that time, she had been so oppressed for so long, she didn\u2019t know what to do with all of her freedom. She tried to mask her pain for years, until finally finding peace and happiness again through addressing her trauma. \n\nShaina shares her thoughts on gr**ming and ab*se, patterns she has seen, and concerns. When she was at the Dollar\u2019s \u201Cyouth outreach\u201D she was constantly scrutinized for her body size, and was even pressured to spend money on a weight consultant and gym membership. Shain passed out from \u201Cfasting\u201D several times, a noted solution for \u201Cthe spirit of gluttony.\u201D\n\nShaina is now reunited with her family, and her sister Sierrah, and is constantly working to build her happiness and help others do the same. Shaina is spiritual and mystic, you can learn more about her, and follow her own journey sharing videos (coming soon!) @PinkPanthressPrincess \n\nAs a reminder, Mark and Leslie Dollar abused dozens, if not a hundred, teens, before moving on to where they now work and associate, The Ramp, in Hamilton, Alabama, under Karen Wheaton.

We practically copied them. I knew they had moved to Hamilton around 2021, and were attending services there. But I had no Idea how deeply they were involved.\n\nThey are not only entangled in the real estate business run by The Ramp higher ups, but rumor has it they take in young people from The Ramp, and even potentially teach there.\n\nKnowing what I know, and also having experienced what I did, with dozens and dozens of others who personally suffered at the hands of these two abusers, I decided I must call them out by name and warn others.\n\n\n501c3 lookup I mentioned here:\nhttps://501c3lookup.org/adullam-youth-outreach_274551552\n\nFollow the journey with others against The Ramp here:\n@godcomplexshow \n\nCheck out this podcast where myself, and others have begun pairing with:\n@amongtheashespodcast \n\nSPOILER BELOW\nThe names of my abusers are Mark and Leslie Dollar, who ran Adullam Youth Outreach in Russellville, AR from 2007-2021. They are now living and working in Hamilton, and are still involved in youth ministry alongside The Ramp, who also has hundreds of allegations against them, in particular their leadership. Cases are being investigated by the FBI regarding many of these leaders. I have now submitted my own tip about my own abusers, and hope that naming them will help even one person avoid their trap.\n\n#theramp #theramphamilton #hamiltonalabama #karenweaton #cult #cults #cultstory #cultsandextremebeliefs #russellvillearkanas #counselor #therapist #cultsurvivor #news #religioustrauma #religiousabuse #abuseawareness",
