      "title": "BIG REVEAL of My Ex-Cult Leaders | Abusers of Dozens | Now They\u2019re at The Ramp in Hamilton, Alabama",
      "description": "In January of 2025 I began sharing my story of abuse that happened at the hands of ex-cult leaders and abusers of dozens others, who I will finally reveal in this video by name.\n\nI began sharing because there were a few whistle blowers speaking up about the same types of allegations against The Ramp, in Hamilton, Alabama, where my abusers currently are.\n\nMy abusers loved Ramp, and we went many times. We practically copied them. I knew they had moved to Hamilton around 2021, and were attending services there. But I had no Idea how deeply they were involved.\n\nThey are not only entangled in the real estate business run by The Ramp higher ups, but rumor has it they take in young people from The Ramp, and even potentially teach there.\n\nKnowing what I know, and also having experienced what I did, with dozens and dozens of others who personally suffered at the hands of these two abusers, I decided I must call them out by name and warn others.\n\n\n501c3 lookup I mentioned here:\nhttps://501c3lookup.org/adullam-youth-outreach_274551552\n\nFollow the journey with others against The Ramp here:\n@godcomplexshow \n\nCheck out this podcast where myself, and others have begun pairing with:\n@amongtheashespodcast \n\nSPOILER BELOW\nThe names of my abusers are Mark and Leslie Dollar, who ran Adullam Youth Outreach in Russellville, AR from 2007-2021. They are now living and working in Hamilton, and are still involved in youth ministry alongside The Ramp, who also has hundreds of allegations against them, in particular their leadership. Cases are being investigated by the FBI regarding many of these leaders. I have now submitted my own tip about my own abusers, and hope that naming them will help even one person avoid their trap.\n\n#theramp #theramphamilton #hamiltonalabama #karenweaton #cult #cults #cultstory #cultsandextremebeliefs #russellvillearkanas #counselor #therapist #cultsurvivor #news #religioustrauma #religiousabuse #abuseawareness",

      "description": "In this video, I briefly talk about what it\u2019s like growing up without a mother. My mom died from cancer when I was seven years old, and she was 40 years old. \n\nI have experienced a lot over the years, and had many repeated traumas. In my experience, there just isn\u2019t as much information or discussion out there about absent, or bad, moms. \n\nI am curious to know about those of you who may relate, and what you may want to discuss and explore.\n\nI worked hard to make happiness for myself, and life got better. I am now a mental health counselor, and recently began speaking out about my cult experience and current allegations against those cults. I want to expand my channel more into mental health, and helping others.\n\nThank you for following in my new journey. \n\n\n#womenhelpingwomen #counselor #therapist #mentalhealth #moms #motherlessdaughter #trauma #complextrauma #ptsd #childhooodtrauma #mystory #podcast #vlog #myjourney #newcreator #grief #growing #healing #helping #happiness #askmeanything",

Karen is close friends with Perry Stone (who has had allegations of SA, and been investigated for fraud) as well as Joni Lamb (the head of Daystar with allegations of not reporting SA of a child). \n\nAll of these \u201Cleaders\u201D have a surprising amount of both money, and abuse allegations. They also have something else in common\u2026\u2026.an inability to take accountability and repent.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nShannon was a member of a small trickle down cult that was based out of Russellville, AR from 2007-2021. This cult modeled themselves after The Ramp, which she attended several times, and followed their teachings, as her cult leaders idolized and wanted to be just like them. Her ex-cult leaders are now living in Hamilton, and are deeply involved in The Ramp.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLearn more:\n\nPerry Stone and Joni Lamb by visiting @theunction220  on YouTube, @JulieRoysReport  follow our cult story exposing The Ramp @GodComplexshow  on youtube.
