      "title": "A Cult Survivor\u0026#39;s Recap | The Full Story in 20 Minutes | \u0026quot;My Youth Pastors Became Cult Leaders\u0026quot;",
      "description": "If you\u0027re new here, you may just be learning that I am an ex-cult member and current mental health Counselor. This is the summary of my story, one in which I joined a youth group, and was groomed by my youth pastors to join their \u0022dream ministry,\u0022 in which they made money under the guise of the \u0022troubled teen industry.\u0022 These youth pastors feigned good intentions, but were slowly entrapping us, taking us further and further from our families, and independence. Once they gained our trust, they started a \u0022ministry\u0022 called, \u0022Adullam Youth Outreach.\u0022 This is the entity under which more than 50 teens and young adults (and counting) would go on to suffer abuse over the course of 14 years. \n\nFor the last six months, I, along with others, have shared stories of abuse, and exposed the truth of OUR side of the story, which was suppressed for so long. I have a 12 part series on those stories under my playlist, \u0022How NOT to Join A Cult,\u0022 where you can learn many more details of those allegations, where they are now, etc., which I briefly touch on here. \n\nI forgot to add this in, but here is what I\u0027ve learned through this process;\n**Some people deal with difficult things by not thinking about them. It isn\u0027t my place to judge how anyone\u0027s path unfolds. But, I am ok with the fact that not everyone will understand mine. Even if I struggle with that sometimes.\n**Two conflicting experiences often can exist at the same time. But abuse IS abuse, and an abuser can still seem \u0022nice,\u0022 or have excuses made for them. That is often why abuse is not straightforward, easy, or something anyone wants to have to address.\n**I feel an endless amount of closure, and surrealness. I always felt their exposure would make me re-evaluate spirituality and coincidence, and leave me with a lot to ponder, and it has. I just didn\u0027t know I would be the one exposing after all these years. \n**I even have less symptoms of CPTSD than I used to.\n**The support has greatly outweighed those who deny, or undermine, our allegations.\n**I do believe that there needs to be major reform in Christianity, especially surrounding mental health, accountability, protection of children, and healthy versus unhealthy group dynamics. Otherwise, these types of abuse will continue to happen.\n\nIf you\u0027re returning for my re-cap, what questions do you still have? What perplexed you the most? What key factors do you feel need to be changed in order to prevent this in the future? WHAT in the WORLD should I talk about next???",

Mark and Leslie refuse to take any accountability despite about 45 survivors who have come together over their shared abuse.

But as time passed, it became clear that abuse was occurring. Shawn suffered verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse, and watched even more occur. Shawn is yet another member of this organization who was told to lie to the department of human services about rules that were not being followed. He saw students being degraded and made fun of. He saw contradictory behavior to what was being taught. He saw questionable treatment towards students and young adults.\n\nThough there is a growing number of survivors, and those being interviewed, many still support Mark and Leslie, and refuse to believe any of our allegations. \n\nMore interviews coming soon.\n\n#strange #true #truecrime #weird #cult #story #mystory #podcast #expos\u00E9 #documentary",

Now we are coming together and coming forward with our allegations. There are around 47 survivors in our private group as well as many more coming forward all the time. This does not even include others impacted, such as parents and families.\n\nThe most disturbing allegations and findings yet seem to show that Mark and Leslie kept a predator on their board for years after learning of abuse, because he was a wealthy donor.\n\nConsistent patterns are arising as we cover their entire timeline operating their ex-cult/ministry \u0022Adullam Youth Outreach.\u0022 I will continue to share more survivor stories. Upcoming will also be discussions between myself and two other survivors who also went on to become mental health professionals. We will discuss common questions that survivors get, and problems faced.\n\nI will be taking a few weeks break, and updating with shorter videos if needed before releasing another interview.\n\n#theramp #theramphamilton #investigation #religiousabuse #religioustrauma #cultstory #cults #cultsandextremebeliefs #weirdandtrue #mentalhealthcounselor #podcast #isurvivied #survivor #conartist #ongoinginvestigation #ongoingstories #advocacy #russellvillearkansas #hamiltonalabama",

      "description": "Brook was left with no other option than to rely on others after finding herself facing homelessness, before she had even graduated from high school, in 2013.\n\nShe met Mark and Leslie Dollar through a church, and ended up utilizing their seemingly kind offer to come and live on their property. Having no other option, she had to accept. Unfortunately, she did not find any more safety or refuge while living with them than she found in any other situation she had been in.\n\nSome may argue that Mark and Leslie helped these young people. I am not above stating that they did indeed offer shelter and precisely THREE basic meals a day (no snacks provided). However, this can be true, and the fact that they abused and exploited these young people, is also true at the same time. Abuse occurred. Full advantage was taken of these young people. \n\nBrook experienced this abuse, as well as various inappropriate moments, while living with Mark and Leslie Dollar from age 18-22. Not only did Mark have a disturbingly close attachment to her, even making fun of his own wife to her, but she also experienced scary behavior from other boys that seemed to be encouraged by Mark. Mark continued to text her years after she left.\n\nIn addition, everything she did was controlled. Leslie threatened to take away Brook\u2019s vehicle, and also called her a slut and a whore, for not wanting to change jobs at their orders. Most adults were forced to work at the same location, just as the children were all forced to go to the same school, or later on, the same \u201Cpost education,\u201D The Ramp. Leslie constantly belittled Brook, as she has done others, usually calling her a slut and a whore.\n\nAs a reminder, Mark and Leslie Dollar abused dozens, if not a hundred, teens, before moving on to where they now work and associate, The Ramp, in Hamilton, Alabama, under Karen Wheaton. They are still using young people and teens for financial gain to this day.\n\nFind the podcast they were on that is suspicious as hell on Youtube \nWhat\u0027s Next God?

Unfortunately, some of those who pretend to offer safety and refuge are, in fact, abusive behind the scenes. \n\nMark and Leslie are yet another example of abuse in Dillon\u0027s childhood. Allowing untrained \u0022leaders\u0022 to decide punishment, humiliating him publicly for confessions made in private, and then further humiliating him by completely forgetting his birthday...meanwhile telling others how much of a \u0022family\u0022 they are offering these children.\n\nFortunately for Dillon, he was able to build a good life for himself and other children. He did not, \u0022come out with issues because he went in with issues...\u0022 He came out with additional trauma and abuse, and he then overcame it.\n\n#theramp #theramphamilton #hamiltonalabama #russellvillearkansas #arkansas #christiannews #cults #cultstory #mystory #speakup #religiousabuse #religioustrauma #cultsandextremebeliefs #strange #dark #cultmembers #sharingstories #cultstories #excultmember #podcast",

She had to leave by basically taking her things and leaving without telling anyone. By that time, she had been so oppressed for so long, she didn\u2019t know what to do with all of her freedom. She tried to mask her pain for years, until finally finding peace and happiness again through addressing her trauma. \n\nShaina shares her thoughts on gr**ming and ab*se, patterns she has seen, and concerns. When she was at the Dollar\u2019s \u201Cyouth outreach\u201D she was constantly scrutinized for her body size, and was even pressured to spend money on a weight consultant and gym membership. Shain passed out from \u201Cfasting\u201D several times, a noted solution for \u201Cthe spirit of gluttony.\u201D\n\nShaina is now reunited with her family, and her sister Sierrah, and is constantly working to build her happiness and help others do the same.

We practically copied them. I knew they had moved to Hamilton around 2021, and were attending services there. But I had no Idea how deeply they were involved.\n\nThey are not only entangled in the real estate business run by The Ramp higher ups, but rumor has it they take in young people from The Ramp, and even potentially teach there.\n\nKnowing what I know, and also having experienced what I did, with dozens and dozens of others who personally suffered at the hands of these two abusers, I decided I must call them out by name and warn others.\n\n\n501c3 lookup I mentioned here:\nhttps://501c3lookup.org/adullam-youth-outreach_274551552\n\nFollow the journey with others against The Ramp here:\n@godcomplexshow \n\nCheck out this podcast where myself, and others have begun pairing with:\n@amongtheashespodcast \n\nSPOILER BELOW\nThe names of my abusers are Mark and Leslie Dollar, who ran Adullam Youth Outreach in Russellville, AR from 2007-2021. They are now living and working in Hamilton, and are still involved in youth ministry alongside The Ramp, who also has hundreds of allegations against them, in particular their leadership. Cases are being investigated by the FBI regarding many of these leaders. I have now submitted my own tip about my own abusers, and hope that naming them will help even one person avoid their trap.\n\n#theramp #theramphamilton #hamiltonalabama #karenweaton #cult #cults #cultstory #cultsandextremebeliefs #russellvillearkanas #counselor #therapist #cultsurvivor #news #religioustrauma #religiousabuse #abuseawareness",

In my experience, there just isn\u2019t as much information or discussion out there about absent, or bad, moms. \n\nI am curious to know about those of you who may relate, and what you may want to discuss and explore.\n\nI worked hard to make happiness for myself, and life got better. I am now a mental health counselor, and recently began speaking out about my cult experience and current allegations against those cults. I want to expand my channel more into mental health, and helping others.\n\nThank you for following in my new journey. \n\n\n#womenhelpingwomen #counselor #therapist #mentalhealth #moms #motherlessdaughter #trauma #complextrauma #ptsd #childhooodtrauma #mystory #podcast #vlog #myjourney #newcreator #grief #growing #healing #helping #happiness #askmeanything",

      "description": "In this video, Shannon, an ex-cult member and current mental health counselor, discusses an alleged cult that you may not have heard about yet. \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have been following the many allegations, you may know about Daystar, Joni Lamb, Perry Stone, or the number of other mega churches who are now being exposed, here\u2019s another to add to that list.\n\nThe \u201Cchurch\u201D and \u201Cministry school\u201D I discuss here is run by yet another from the \u201Cname it and claim it,\u201D era, a religious singer and \u201Cminister\u201D named Karen Wheaton who runs The Ramp in Hamilton, Alabama. Karen is close friends with Perry Stone (who has had allegations of SA, and been investigated for fraud) as well as Joni Lamb (the head of Daystar with allegations of not reporting SA of a child). \n\nAll of these \u201Cleaders\u201D have a surprising amount of both money, and abuse allegations. They also have something else in common\u2026\u2026.an inability to take accountability and repent.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nShannon was a member of a small trickle down cult that was based out of Russellville, AR from 2007-2021. This cult modeled themselves after The Ramp, which she attended several times, and followed their teachings, as her cult leaders idolized and wanted to be just like them. Her ex-cult leaders are now living in Hamilton, and are deeply involved in The Ramp.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLearn more:\n\nPerry Stone and Joni Lamb by visiting @theunction220  on YouTube, @JulieRoysReport  follow our cult story exposing The Ramp @GodComplexshow  on youtube.
