      "description": "Syran Warner joins me on today\u2019s show. He\u2019s an independent journalist who previously worked for an alt-weekly in Minneapolis in several capacities over the course of 13 years. He now investigates cults in America and has begun exposing them, almost singlehandedly taking down The Body in Alaska and Profundity Yours in East Texas. Both have since relocated after Syran brought their practices to light. He has a fascinating story. We also get into Charles Manson, Jim Jones, and Scientology. Check it out!
