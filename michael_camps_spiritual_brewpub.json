      "description": "Michael chats with Gloria Beth Amodeo (goes by Beth) on her journey into and out of evangelical Christianity. Learn how a charming, insecure girl from a troubled family became a NYC evangelist for a Christian fundamentalist movement that sought to govern her every thought and action. We discuss Beth\u0027s book, God\u0027s Ex-Girlfriend, a wry, poignant, and unflinchingly honest memoir that unveils the cult-like operations of Campus Crusade for Christ and much of evangelicalism. Listen and learn the lessons Beth learned. Is the evangelical Jesus the real Jesus?
