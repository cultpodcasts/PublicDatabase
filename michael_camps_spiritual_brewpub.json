      "description": "Today, we discuss a very important book with our guest author Eric English. It\u0027s \u0022The Kingdom of Man: Evangelicalism and the Distortion of Christianity.\u0022 Eric and I discuss the history of the evangelical movement, what the milestones were when things went south, how we got to where we are today, and some critical correctives to go from a \u0022kingdom of man\u0022 to a more authentic society, based on divine love. We discuss: How did a small group of religious people become the most powerful political force in the U.S.? Why are Christians leaving this group? What is Christian Nationalism, and how does Donald Trump fit into this? Guest Eric English writes a column on the Patheos Progressive Christian channel and hosts a podcast called UNenlightenment. He holds advanced degrees in philosophy and theology.
