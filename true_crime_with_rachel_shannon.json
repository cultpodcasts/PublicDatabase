      "description": "This episode dives into one of the most disturbing true crime cases to emerge from an elite college campus. Larry Ray, a manipulative and charismatic father figure, infiltrated his daughter\u2019s social circle and gradually gained control over her friends using psychological abuse, coercion, and fear to exploit them over several years.\n\nThrough emotional manipulation, isolation, and financial control, Ray created a cult-like environment where young students were stripped of their autonomy and forced into submission. What began as trust and mentorship slowly turned into a nightmare of exploitation.\n\nThis story exposes how abuse can hide in plain sight, the dangers of unchecked authority, and the long-lasting impact of psychological control. A chilling reminder that cult dynamics don\u2019t always look the way we expect.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
