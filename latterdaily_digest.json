      "title": "Is the Mormon Church a Cult? Two Famous Aussies Say So!",
      "description": "Breaking this week! An explosive submission to the Victorian Parliamentary Inquiry into cults alleges the Mormon Church is operating as a cult on Australian soil. The Australian Post-Mormon Community claims the institution engages in deceptive recruitment, amasses staggering wealth through mandatory tithing, and lacks financial transparency. \n\nThe submission details alleged harms, including the abusive missionary system and intrusive private interviews with children and youth. Former members, prepared to offer oral testimony, urge the Victorian government to implement sweeping legal reforms and create a regulatory body to curb the institutional power and abuses.\n\nWant to create live streams like this?
