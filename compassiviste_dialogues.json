      "description": "Today, we\u2019re honored to share the incredible journey of Daniella Mestyanek Young.\n\nRaised in the notorious Children of God cult, Daniella escaped and transformed her life, ultimately becoming a U.S. Army captain and intelligence officer on the frontlines in Afghanistan. Her bestselling memoir, praised for its powerful storytelling, has been compared to Educated and The Glass Castle.\n\nIn this episode, we\u2019ll dive into Daniella\u2019s path to success, her insights into the complexities of group behavior, and her work in leadership and organizational psychology.

She put herself through high school and graduated as college valedictorian before commissioning into the US Army as an intelligence officer. That\u2019s where she really started to think about group behavior\u2026and seeing it, well, everywhere.\n\nDaniella deployed twice to Afghanistan (2011, 2014) and became a member of one of the Army\u2019s first Female Engagement teams (an experiment that put women into deliberate ground combat for the first time in Army history, and eventually led to the repeal of the sexist combat ban and the gender desegregation of the entire US military).\n\nShe is a proud daughter of the 101st, (that\u0027s the unit in Band of Brothers), a recipient of the Presidential Volunteer Service Award (from Obama, y\u0027all), and is currently pursuing a Master of Arts in Organizational Psychology at the Harvard Extension School (she focuses her research on group behavior, social norms, culture, extremism, leadership demagoguery and cults).\n\nKEY NOTES:\n\nThe Cult of Work: Is it Exploitation or Empowerment?\nThe Dream Sellers: How Manipulation Drives Modern Exploitation\nExploitation as a Profitable Model: The Business of Control\nA System of Justice for the Wealthy and Punishment for the Poor\nFrom Religious Zeal to Celebrity Worship: Why We Keep Chasing Illusions\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - Episode Trailer\n01:24 - Intro \u00A0\n03:16 - The Cult of Labor: Work or Exploitation? \u00A0\n11:55 - Selling the Dream: How Manipulation Fuels Modern Exploitation \u00A0\n17:14 - Exploitation as a Business Model \u00A0\n22:33 - Justice for the Rich, Punishment for the Poor: The Flawed System \u00A0\n28:39 - From Religion to Celebrity Culture: How We Keep Buying the Same Illusions \u00A0\n37:00 - How Societies Keep Women Fighting Each Other \u00A0\n43:47 - Why Instagram Is More Dangerous Than Nukes \u00A0\n47:47 - Feminism as a Path to a Sustainable Future \u00A0\n54:40 - Can the Publishing Industry Embrace Ethics Without Sacrificing Success? \u00A0\n01:04:20 - Healing or Hiding?
