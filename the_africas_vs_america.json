In the spring of 1985, the City of Philadelphia became the first in U.S. history to drop a bomb on a family of American citizens.

A family of Black radicals known collectively as MOVE, who found themselves ensnared in a city \u2014 and nation\u2019s \u2014 domestic war on Black Liberation. Over seven episodes, host Matthew Amha investigates the events that culminated in the MOVE bombing, and the long afterlife of a forgotten American tragedy. Through intimate conversations, The Africas VS. America offers an unseen look into the MOVE\u0027s origins and dynamics while looking ahead to the group\u0027s uncertain future.",
