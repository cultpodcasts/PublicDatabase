      "description": "Imagine being a mother separated from her infant by an oppressive group like the Sullivanians with cult-like control. In this episode hear Annie\u0027s heartbreaking journey to rescue her daughter Rosie from the Sullivanians. With the crucial help of a women\u0027s shelter\u0027s dedicated legal advocates, I helped Annie orchestrate a daring escape and go into hiding. There is urgency and tension in every step of her plan to reclaim her daughter. Listen to the emotional turbulence that eventually culminates in the courtroom battle for custody that exposes the spurious workings of the Sullivanians, threatening their existence. The episode also sheds light on the broader experiences of former members of the Sullivan Institute, including the emotional and social challenges they faced. Through gripping accounts from individuals like Ben and Karen, who risked everything for their freedom, and the eventual downfall of the group under Saul Newton\u0027s erratic rule, this is a poignant exploration of life within a cult. When joining a cult you are unaware of the full level of commitment you are about to make, or the extent to which your autonomy is about to be curtailed. I hope that by sharing my personal story and shedding light on the Sullivanians, I\u0027ve helped to explain why people are attracted to cults in the first place. In Annie\u0027s case, some are born into them, for some, it is the promise of a community or to better themselves, or the promise of sexual availability, but it is usually during a time of vulnerability in a person\u0027s life. This is the final chapter. My name is Shelley Feinerman. I hope you have found the podcast of interest and I thank you for listening. I went on to have a successful career, married, and have an amazing son.

      "description": "What if you found yourself trapped within a group that controlled every aspect of your life, from your relationships to how you spent your money? This episode unveils some of the dark realities inside the Sullivanians, the infamous cult that hid in plain sight on Manhattan\u0027s Upper West Side, in the years after Cora left. Learn about the group\u0027s manipulative tactics, inspired by the theories of Harry Stack Sullivan, which forced members into rigid and often detrimental lifestyles. These oppressive dynamics strained family bonds, induced severe anxiety, and left members grappling with emotional and financial turmoil. After 10 years Annie Steinman re-enters Cora\u0027s life. You will hear her how the Institute\u0027s brutal regime upended her life. With the absence of June Geddes, Saul\u0027s unyielding control became even more suffocating as the women of the group became mothers as Annie did.. Annie shares the protocols of pregnancy and the devastating loss of her daughter, Rosie, to the Institute\u0027s grip. Her story is a stark reminder of the profound personal costs of such manipulative environments. This episode is an eye-opening account of the search for autonomy and the enduring impact of living under such a repressive system.

In this episode and the next I will take a deeper dive into my relationship with Chris Crenshaw, first mentioned in episode four which covered Jonestown\u0027s and my realization the group was a cult and the group\u2019s exodus to Florida after The Three Mile Island accident and partial nuclear meltdown ( it might be worth a re-listen) and the Open Union, an independent socialist, activist, and education center where we met. The threads of love, and loss, were woven into the unyielding force of the Sullivanian\u0027s influence on me. Ollie briefly reenters my life and brings a flood of emotion and memories. We share a vulnerable conversation that navigates our shared history, the weight of regret, and love. As Ollie prepares to leave New York City, we grasp one more night together, and the promise of staying connected. This episode is more than a narrative; it\u0027s a testament to the resilience of the human heart and the profound impact of our choices\u2014intertwined with the relentless pursuit of personal freedom and political conviction becoming a catalyst for leaving the group and therapy As always thank you for listening and please share your thoughts if so inclined .

The shift coincided with Lewin\u0027s marriage to his second wife a soap opera actress and aspiring stage director. It was her idea to merge the two. Personal identities were subsumed by the Fourth Wall\u2019s collective thinking. Membership was mandatory along with its burgeoning monetary demands.

      "description": "After my sister\u2019s marriage, I began to feel trapped by the tendrils of my mother\u2019s expectations and my desire for independence. After five years I was ready to leave home. This episode unwraps the story of how I navigated the apartment\u0027s close quarters and the late-night disruptions of my mother\u0027s dating life and meeting Greg, also an art student from Queens College with his own tangled family web. We shared creative dreams and friendship, but because of the humiliation I experienced after Tommy I stubbornly refused his offer of love. Faced with an ultimatum and yearning, I accepted Greg and we began to build a life together. Unfortunately, our journey was fraught with the demands of Greg\u2019s narcissistic and bullying father and my mother\u0027s traditional views that clashed with my desire for self-discovery and happiness. Navigating the stormy seas of the 1960s generational divides and societal pressures, this episode delves into the emotional confrontation between my mother\u0027s cliched disapproval over our then unconventional choice to live together. Her concern for social optics clashed with my wanting to build a life with Greg. This episode explores how my desire for personal identity, love, and approval framed my future. Whether you are drawn to the echoes of familial bonds and the pursuit of individuality or have personally been faced with similar issues of independence, this story will resonate as it details the complexities of carving out one\u0027s path while honoring the roots from which we\u0027ve grown.

      "description": "Today\u0027s episode begins Thanksgiving Day three years after I became entangled with the Sullivanians a seemingly benign group that supported creativity but would morph into the singular cult that remained undetected on Manhattan Upper West Side. Annie was my roommate and friend, but I on that day I began to realize her ardent belief in the Sullivanians as the vanguard party that would would soon shape the world\u0027s future was all encompassing. On that frigid day we found our way to a Greenwich Village cafe where Annie also openly discussed wrestling with the presence of her mother in the group. I\u0027d often thought of Maria as an older sister and Annie as the younger but going forward, her declaration left me in the murky waters of uncertainty. The episode doesn\u0027t end at the caf\u00E9, though. Learn why I was referred to a fourth therapist in three years and how I wind up at Reliable Lists, Inc and how I\u0027m guided by Stan Arnold, my new therapist, to become part of that office\u0027s union drive. The episode culminates in an emotionally charged farewell,, as Maria Alena departs for Sierra Leone.

We\u0027re confronted with the superficiality of his gestures and his strange declaration, \u0022That\u0027s what fathers are for\u0022 and grapple with the innate desire for parental affirmation. Eight years pass and then during the rawest of conversations with my mother, she unveils secrets that have simmered beneath the surface for decades. Prompted by my therapist I\u0027m meeting with my father who amid the clinking of dinnerware, has some revelations of his own.

      "description": "Initially, the group was a vibrant blend of energy\u2014artists, musicians, writers, actors, politics, and interpersonal drama. Serena left the apartment, and Sandra Aguilar, the only minority in the group, was added to the mix. In the group, there was an elite hierarchy among the trainees, the therapists of the institute, and the people they dated, who were given preferential placement in the burgeoning Marxist classes. In this episode, you\u0027ll learn about the conflict created by Annie\u0027s decision to hire and then fire Steve Berman, a non-Sullivanian, as an instructor of Intro to Marxism based on the directive of Annie\u0027s therapist. This is another example of Annie\u0027s intractability and a foreshadowing of events to come as heard in the Aug 30, 2023, Through a Blue Window( getting out) episode. The episode takes an intimate and harrowing turn as it recounts the dictate given to me by my therapist after a call from my sister, the support I did receive, and the emotional wasteland I still can find myself wandering in a lifetime later. In the immediate aftermath of leaving the Sullivanians, in the quiet of my new apartment, I wrote an eulogy for my mother. This was the first step in helping me shape the trajectory of my life and 45 years later I still turn to it when I feel her presence and profound absence.

First with Kenny, my summer crush who loved me, but then taking a sharp turn to the unsettling encounter with Robert Scheinman the most popular boy in the senior class. Imagine a house party that veered off-course spiraling into chaos, an event that would leave my mother in a rage if found out. And the disappointment in realizing that for Robert it was only about sex. The intensity escalates with a chilling story that shifts to a .gripping account of a night that took an unwelcome turn, morphing from casual fun to an unwarranted assault. This narration bears the burden of exploitation and understanding consent and the scars left when ignored. This peeled-back narrative is marked by betrayal, that is as raw as it is real. By sharing these deeply personal stories, I hope to preserve a piece of history from the 1960s that emphasizes the enduring importance of finding the strength to speak out which I did not possess at the time.

Forget them already.\u201D And then Aggie uttered the phrase I\u2019d become all too familiar with during my short time with the Sullivanians. It was what Jackson had said to me and what I had said to Monica, It was a phrase that begins a sentence but stops all further discussion in its tracks. \u201CMy therapist said it was okay.\u0022 And then she continued, \u0022My therapist said it was okay for me to tell Liz to stop or else.\u0022 Twenty--four hours later Liz had disappeared, vanished, and with her Aggie\u0027s prescription of Valium. After a frenzied night trying to locate Liz. hoping the worst hadn\u0027t happened, we finally learned the truth and how Aggie\u0027s toxic behavior had been the catalyst that had pushed Liz to the edge.

A sixth-grade party goes horribly wrong taking with it my self-esteem as I enter Junior High School without friends. Wanting a more grown-up look for junior high school, Anita and I decided to cut our hair into the layered look, the au currant style of the time leaving me with dandelion fuzz every time the barometer went above fifty percent. I wore scarves, like Audrey Hepburn, I fantasied, but wound up looking more like old Mrs. McCormick, our next-door neighbor who\u2019d bang on the wall between our apartments when she was drunk, yelling, \u2018You dirty kikes.\u2019 With Anita gone and because of the Clifford incident, I didn\u2019t have a single friend when I started Kingsley Junior High School, but I\u2019d been placed in Honor Art and that\u2019s where I met Suzanne, only to be abandoned by her two years later when her desire to be popular became more important than our friendship and I was left behind. Eventually, I found a good friend in Rachel. We shared our first sexual experiences, which for me brought back the memory of the rape scene from Peyton Place, the movie that my mother took me to see as a ten-year-old, the traumatic scene that profoundly shaped my ideas about sex and, bolstered by my mother\u0027s continued mixed messages about what \u0022nice girls\u0022 do, just adding to my confusion and misconceptions. You will find out about the sealed envelope handed to me by my guidance for my mother to sign but instead found its way to the bottom of the sewer, torn into tiny pieces.

I\u0027d been in the group for six months, but I had no idea what to expect as I headed out to the East End of Long Island to spend the summer cleaning summerhouses. It was Memorial Day 1974, and during the long train ride, I finally learned the details of what had only previously been alluded to and the importance of maintaining a veil of secrecy from the locals. This episode is also about Monica Cipro, the first and only relationship I had with a woman, and despite falling in love with each other that summer, a cold wind of conflicting views about the group ended what had barely begun. I would spend four more years in the group.

      "description": "I was living in a group apartment but I wasn\u0027t officially in Sullivanian therapy. The next step in the process was to have a consultation with one of the four licensed therapists and as the day approached, my roommates were all a twitter. Though I had previously eschewed joining anything, from the Brownies to Gamma Gamma in high school, I seemed to adapt, one could argue, that I blossomed amidst the Arlettians, at first. Never mind that it meant severing all contact with my mother. Never mind that I allowed my friendship with Rachel to disintegrate like the yellowed edges of an old book. Never mind that I was staying up late, falling asleep, stretched like sinew on a bow. To cover all my additional group expenses I began to clean group apartments which led to a life-threatening emergency. After my recovery, I continued to clean and met a remarkable number of men in a matter of months and soon I was having sex with virtual strangers more men than I could count on the fingers of two hands.

Each history began with your earliest memory and ended on the day you entered the group and like Madame Defarge, all this information was knitted into the group\u2019s collective conscious with every detail deemed significant. History sessions were recorded with the trainees passing the tapes on to their supervisors and then in turn to Seth. Childhood trauma was the bedrock of therapy and the way in which Cora and the others in the group were controlled. Abandonment was a constant thread throughout Cora\u0027s life and the turmoil of one event in particular and the emotional roller coaster of unanswered questions it created. This episode delves into the inherent power and profound influence our childhood experiences wield over our lives and how Cora, \u0022in the twilight before sleep, flies out the window, into the mystery of a sudden disappearance and asks why.\u0022 The complete documentary Through a BlueWindow can be seen on my youtube channel shellfein1.

My therapist said I didn\u0027t have to give my reasons and that I could just ask the apartment to ask her to leave. You could either vote yes or no based on my request.\u0022 This is what Annie, my once-upon-a-time ally and friend in the group asked of our roommates, in the apartment where I had lived for three years. I had heard this uncompromising reasoning many times in my five years in the group. To me, it was bullying. In the end, it was majority rule and I had a week to leave. A group apartment was forming on the 12th floor of our building and that was where I wound up. This new apartment coming together in the middle of the winter didn\u0027t exactly include the cream of the Sullivanian crop, . A week after I moved upstairs, Stan, my fourth and final therapist - a former history teacher - in another bizarre twist, asked me if I wanted to move back because if I did, \u0027I should call the apartment and ask for a house meeting and say that I should be allowed to move back because Annie had bullied my roommates.\u0022 This is exactly what I had said to him weeks before. To this day, I don\u0027t know what held me to the chair because at the time every impulse I had was urging me to grab Stan by his bony shoulders and shake him until he fell apart. Listen to this episode and hear how Stan\u0027s incompetence and Annie\u0027s bullying helped me recover the resilience I thought was lost.

      "description": "CULT! Through a Blue Window: is a podcast that chronicles the rise and fall of the Sullivanian Institute and its members. This psycho-sexual therapy institute existed on Manhattan\u0027s Upper West Side from the 1970s through the 1990s, and in later years was characterized as a cult. I was a member of the Sullivanians for five years during which time I was directed to abandon family and friends. After learning of my mother\u0027s death in May 1975, while deeply entrenched in the Sullivanians, I was ordered not to go to the funeral, and I didn\u2019t, thus inextricably altering my life and a decision I regret to this day. The first hour-and-a-half podcast and ensuing chapters tell of these events, beginning with my earliest memory - a \u0027history,\u0027 if you will, to borrow from the Sullivanian lexicon and bedrock of their control. Once in the group members were instructed to break ties with their families, and in particular mothers, who were seen as toxic and the root of all neurosis. This philosophy was the engine that drove the Sullivanian ideology. In 2013, still haunted by the events of my involvement, I began to write a memoir. By trade, I am a visual artist and teacher, and also a poet and short story writer. I had no idea the deep dive and the many many iterations and years it would take to complete the book. I tried to get an agent or publisher, however, the book languished on my computer. Years passed, then with the advent of iMovie and using my memoir as the scaffolding I created a documentary. It was an official selection of New FilmMakers NY 2020 and a Spotlight Documentary Bronze award winner for artistic merit. Unlike other practicing therapists who worked under a strict code of ethics, there were no such boundaries for the Sullivanians or \u0022the group,\u0022 as the members of the Institute and their therapists were self-referentially known. Sex between patients and therapists, the wide use of Valium, and drinking were encouraged The Village Voice and NewYorkMagazine, documented these events in 1989, blowing the lid off the pathological and secretive lives of the group from its seemingly benign beginnings to the children and to the bravery of three former members and the custody battles that ensued. One, a very brave mother who was forced into hiding with her newborn baby, and two fathers who fought for custody after escaping. The Sullivanians were eventually brought down by their collective paranoia, and hubris. Through Blue Window recounts all these events in a podcast for anyone who would find it hard to wrap their head around the want or need to belong to a group like this and wants to understand why. This is my personal accounting tracing early childhood trauma that made me vulnerable to the lure of a group that painted itself as the vanguard party, where the patients were controlled by the information they revealed in sessions as well as by sex, sleep deprivation, and valium, This is what you will hear in Through a Blue Window: the podcast now available for download through many platforms: Apple, Amazon, iheartradio The documentary can be seen on my YouTube channel shellfein1.
