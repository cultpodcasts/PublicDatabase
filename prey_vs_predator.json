Lindsey opens up about her traumatic childhood experiences of manipulation, extreme discipline, and psychological abuse that left her anxious and struggling with PTSD. As a child, Lindsey felt unheard, afraid, and starved of creativity and authentic self-expression, but maintained an inner fire. Now empowered, Lindsey uses her voice to expose IBLP\u2019s tactics and bring hope to other victims seeking to break free. Her journey truly inspired us on Prey VS Predator and epitomizes the strength of the human spirit we love to highlight on our podcast.

We dig in to the outright manipulation and lack of responsibility shown by the Duggar parents, as well as the larger issues of systemic abuse enabled and perpetuated by the religious institution. We also explore the culture of victim-blaming, and share our own experiences dealing with spiritual abuse. Join us as we break down how predators maintain control by creating a community of perfect prey. Our hope is that by speaking out we can giver others a language to put this kind of abuse and thereby reclaim their voices through this understanding.

After watching the documentary \u0022Shiny Happy People\u0022, we knew we had to cover the fascinating and terrifying dynamics uncovered by this series. And, so, we begin a series of enlightening discussions about the controversial Duggar family. In this first video, we analyze the manipulative coercion and control tactics used in the Duggar\u0027s religious cult. Drawing from our own experiences, we explain how many mainstream churches subtly promote similar values that can enable abuse. We break down how fear, loving moments, isolation, and punishment are used to control victims and force obedience. Finally, we examine how predators exploit prey\u0027s innocence and desire for connection. We hope our discussion provides some insight into recognizing and challenging religious systems of abuse.

Acknowledging and respecting each other\u0027s boundaries is an undeniable part of any healthy relationship, and while it can be incredibly hard to uphold your own boundaries, it really is necessary for self-protection and self-respect. If you\u0027re in a relationship with a predator, understanding the dynamics of boundaries can not only be useful for self-protection, but it can also help you identify early signs of predatory behaviour that lead to abuse, such as anger, rage, resentment and rejection. Does any of this sound familiar? We would love to hear your story.

      "description": "Did you know that establishing healthy boundaries can protect you from emotional abuse? In this episode of Prey VS Predator, we do a deep dive into the importance of setting healthy personal boundaries as a safeguard against predators. Parental and societal influences mould our perception of boundaries for good and ill. Among other things, we explore the difference between real boundaries and pseudo-boundaries, the complications of boundary-setting, and share our personal experiences of setting boundaries, and how it is both easier and harder than you think Remember, prioritizing self-love and recognizing your value is key to maintaining emotional health. You have a right to set your own boundaries, just like other people have a responsibility to respect them. Does any of this sound familiar? We would love to hear your story.

In this episode of Prey VS Predator, we conclude our series with our guest Sophia. As we wrap up the conversation, Sophia shares the difficulty of confronting her community about her abusive husband\u0027s behaviour and the loss of many friends that followed this disclosure. Throughout this final chapter of our conversation, we explore the role of justice, compassion, and accountability when dealing with predators, especially in significant institutions such as the church. Sophia also stresses the importance of building mutually respectful relationships and the necessity of having an exit strategy and a supportive team when dealing with a controlling partner. This episode is filled with powerful insights about healing from abuse, setting boundaries, and recovering from abuse. If you\u0027re battling with similar experiences or know someone who is, Sophia\u2019s story will definitely resonate... but also offer some hope. Don\u2019t forget to reach out if you need help, and remember, you are not alone.

In this conversation, we do a deep dive with Sophia into the alarming power dynamics within religious institutions, and how this power is often rooted in a misguided loyalty to a narcissistic and predatory leader.

Today is our second conversation with Carla Shohet, a trauma and narcissistic abuse recovery psychologist in the U.K. In this episode, Carla discusses the central issue in trauma recovery: the mind/body connection. This, according to Carla, is THE ISSUE when trying to understand how trauma impacts people, and that even the body\u0027s seemingly unhelpful defence mechanisms are actually attempts to heal itself.

Now, in the aftermath of his divorce, Darrel struggles under the confusion and disorientation himself, even as he finds a new lease on life. Darrel\u0027s story proves that the predator and prey roles aren\u2019t strictly gendered. Men can be prey and women can be predators. In fact, given the tight-lipped default most men have concerning emotional issues, this is likely more common than we know. In this episode we explore Darrell\u2019s story, the red flags he feels he should have noticed in his ex, and how he finally managed to break free from his partner. We are so grateful for Darrel\u0027s willingness to share his story and be vulnerable with us.

This is Jill\u0027s story of intimate partner abuse. Jill\u0027s story is heartbreaking. Throughout her first marriage, her husband slowly showed himself to be a predator. But his abusive behaviour didn\u0027t start after they got married. According to Jill herself, her ex\u0027s predatory tendencies were clear to everyone around her... but not to her. Why? Why is it so hard to see the toxic behaviours in our partners? Why does it remain difficult even while we\u0027re in the middle of abuse? Why can we remain blind to it even while others, especially our kids, are telling us the person is no good? In this episode we explore the complexities of spousal abuse and how, even in the midst of abuse, there is hope.

Especially when you are already trying to distance yourself from your predator, setting up your own boundaries for self-care, how can you help your kids process and navigate their relationship with the predator when, quite often, it\u0027s not possible to cut ties completely? In this episode, we explore what a parent can do to support their child. Although you won\u0027t be able to protect them from abuse, you can help your children by working to be the best version of yourself, creating a safe place for your kids to experience their emotions, and working with your kids to develop a language for understanding their experiences.

Amber is one of our three courageous hosts. Besides being a performer, artist and coach, Amber\u2019s story and perspective is unique because her predator and emotional abuser is a parent. Amber\u2019s story undermines any notion that we can simply avoid these relationships. In fact, her experiences felt so normal that it took an outsider saying, \u201COh, it sounds like you were emotionally abused\u201D for things to click. And, worse still, she has to engage with her abuser on a regular basis. In this episode, Amber offers some great advice on how PREY can minimize the impact PREDATORS have on their lives, particularly in cases of parental abuse. Does any of what we discuss sound familiar?

It\u0027s also quite common for prey in these relationships to justify their predator in all sorts of ways, excusing their behaviors and accepting the narrative they\u2019re they\u0027re spinning: YOU\u2019RE the problem. YOU\u2019RE being selfish. YOU\u2019RE not taking THEM into consideration.

      "description": "Bren\u00E9 Brown, a powerful voice in the area of emotional abuse, often says that to people, your story is not for everyone. Sharing our story can be an incredibly vulnerable thing. It opens us up and exposes us to the judgement of others, which is not something we should do lightly, especially as prey - victims of emotional abuse - who are eager to remove any barriers to deeper relationships. It\u0027s also dangerous to accept the narratives others have created for us, which is something predators do to maintain control. Being able to see and name this control tactic can help prey regain power over their identity and grow into greater confidence and self-assurance.

Do you feel constantly gaslit, misled or made to feel inferior and unworthy of love?

      "description": "What is the language of abuse? Have you ever been told by a partner, friend of family member, \u0022I know you better than you know yourself\u0022? Amber, one of our hosts on this podcast, discusses how her mother used this phrase to control and manipulate - to tell her who she was and what she could accomplish. One of the most powerful ways predators control their prey is by imposing themselves on their prey\u2019s story. They can do this by laying claim to an insider\u2019s knowledge of another person, saying things like, \u201CI know you better than you know yourself\u201D. Amber experienced this with her mother who was constantly telling her who she was, her flaws and failures, and diminishing her successes. It may seem benign but this simple strategy is a powerful way predators shut up and shut down their prey. Does this sound familiar? We would love to hear your story.

      "description": "Welcome to Prey VS Predator! This podcast is all about helping people identify and put a language to emotional abuse. As survivors of emotional abuse, what we call PREY on this podcast, we three hosts (Jill, Amber and PJ) all draw from wells of personal experience to equip others with the language and tools they need to navigate relationships with predators. Tune in every week as we unpack what it means to be \u0027PREY\u0027 and \u0027PREDATOR\u0027, and how understanding these patterns of behavior can help us navigate our world.
