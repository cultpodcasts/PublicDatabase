In this episode, we dive deeper into our conversation with Carolyn from Hagar\u0027s Voice, an organization dedicated to supporting survivors of clergy sexual abuse. Carolyn discusses the systemic problems within churches that silence female victims, the patriarchal power structures, and the importance of trauma-informed advocacy in hopes of bringing the dark side of the church to light. We wanted to cover essential topics such as the DARVO response, empowering survivors, and the crucial steps churches can take to address abuse actively. We want to encourage you to engage in intentional, informed, and supportive actions, following the ten outlined principles by Hagar\u0027s Voice to support victims effectively.

In this episode of Prey versus Predator, with our guest Sarah, we discuss the impact of coercive religions and relationships on individuals, focusing on the concept of \u0027Post Traumatic Church Syndrome.\u0027 Sarah, from Sacred Unraveling, shares her personal story of leaving a coercive religion and an abusive relationship. She describes how both experiences had profound effects on her mental health, self-esteem, and ability to recognize and respond to red flags. Sarah outlines her journey of deconstruction - critically examining and re-evaluating her beliefs, leading to a process of healing and empowerment. In the second part of the episode, Sarah highlights the importance of having resources and language to understand and articulate experiences with coercion and abuse. Through Sacred Unraveling, Sarah aims to provide support and hope to others in similar situations, offering insights on recognizing abuse, reclaiming personal power, and the path to recovery. The discussion emphasizes the role of community, awareness, and the empowering realization that survivors have voices and choices.

Through a close reading of Little Red Riding Hood, we can actually find some helpful insights into predatory tactics! In this episode of Prey VS Predator, we explore elements of coercive control through the lens of this classic fairy tale, and look into how the wolf\u0027s behavior\u2014using love bombing, dismissiveness, and feigning victimhood\u2014parallels the tactics of predators in real life. We also examine how predators often manipulate perceptions to appear as victims, confusing their prey and exploiting their caregiving instincts. We hope this episode equips you with the knowledge and strategies to guard against predatory behavior, fostering a deeper understanding of coercive control dynamics in various contexts.

In this episode, we discuss the realities of dealing with coercive control within the context of separation and custody battles. Courtney shares her journey of escaping an abusive relationship, only to face ongoing legal and personal challenges, including manipulation, stalking, and intimidation from her ex-husband, even in the presence of law enforcement and judicial oversight. Despite obtaining multiple restraining orders and engaging in legal battles for the safety of herself and her children, Courtney details the systemic failures that often re-victimize survivors. She highlights the importance of understanding coercive control, the impact on children, and the struggle for legal recognition of non-physical forms of abuse. Courtney also discusses her advocacy work through NJprotectivemoms.org, aiming to support other survivors and push for legislative changes to address coercive control and abusive litigation in family law.

In this episode, we dive into the nuances of coercive control, a pervasive yet often misunderstood form of domestic abuse.

Welcome back to Prey Versus Predator. In this episode we explore the concept of \u0027flying monkeys\u0027 within the context of abusive relationships and narcissistic manipulation. A flying monkey is someone who a predator enlists in order to alienate and harass their victims in order to further the victim\u0027s isolation and trauma. We share many personal examples of how we have experienced these Flying Monkeys in our own lives. This episode offers insights on recognizing and dealing with flying monkeys, advocating for victims to establish boundaries and protect themselves from further harm. Additionally, it provides advice for listeners to avoid becoming flying monkeys themselves, highlighting the importance of questioning narratives that paint others in a negative light without evidence.

Welcome to part two of our conversation with Chad Harris, featured in the \u0027Shiny Happy People Duggar Family Secrets\u0027 docuseries! In this episode, Chad discusses his journey of escaping the highly controlling and cultish environment of the Institute of Basic Life Principles (IBLP) and its homeschooling branch, the Advanced Training Institute (ATI). Chad shares the physical and emotional repercussions of being raised in such an environment, his process of deconstructing his faith, and his pursuit of happiness outside of fundamentalism. He also touches on the systemic issues within IBLP, his goals to see the institution shut down and Bill Gothard brought to justice, and his current spiritual stance as an atheist open to possibilities. Finally, we discuss the grooming of males within IBLP, the impact of coercive control, and the importance of listening to one\u0027s authentic self.

      "description": "Chad Harris from Shiny Happy People shares his shocking story of living the majority of his life under the Controlling Cults known as the Independent Fundamental Baptist (IFB) Movement and the Advanced Training Institute (ATI). We are so excited to have Chad Harris on Prey VS Predator. Chad discusses his background growing up and living in the Independent Fundamental Baptist (IFB) church cult. Chad was raised in a strict and isolated environment, where his upbringing was marked by fear, emotional, and physical abuse under the guise of religious discipline. We learned that a turning point came when Chad began to question the abusive and secretive practices within the church, especially after learning about alleged crimes committed by respected members of the community, including Bill Gothard. Chad was mainly met with silence and avoidance, particularly from his father, a preacher who had previously been vocal against other injusticies. This revelation prompted Chad to leave the church, seek therapy, and eventually share his story publicly, contributing to the \u2018Shiny Happy People\u2019 docu-series on Amazon. We also dive into the complexities of distinguishing between Prey and Predator roles within such controlling environments, questioning how power dynamics and fear can silence dissent and perpetuate abuse.

      "description": "Is my partner a narcissist? That is a question that Dr. Tamara Knott seeks to answer through sharing her groundbreaking research on the five stages of narcissistic abuse. Dr. Tamara Knott has done extensive research on the stages of relationships with narcissistic partners. She identifies five stages: the foundations of the relationship, where partners experience some life transition; the stage below the surface, where one gets a peek at the narcissist\u0027s manipulative behaviors; the roller coaster stage, characterized by intense ups and downs; the recovery and leaving stage, where people start the recovery process before leaving the relationship; and the hindsight stage, where people look back on the relationship with clarity. We also take a look at the innate skills that narcissists possess and their ability to lure in and manipulate prey for long-term benefits. The conversation also touches on the origins of narcissistic behavior, suggesting it is a combination of nature and nurture. Dr. Knott emphasizes the importance of education and empowerment for those affected by narcissistic abuse. She offers counseling services through her website, www.adventurecounseling.com, and provides online counseling for those around the world.

      "description": "Ensuring our Children\u0027s safety is often a battle. Predators frequently use manipulative tactics, such as parental alienation, to disrupt prey post separation. This often leads to children\u0027s safety becoming jeopardized. In this episode we tackle this challenging topic and discuss how predators can manipulate family courts, which impacts the prey parents and the children involved. We further discuss reunification camps and the fact that they are an unregulated industry. We hope you enjoy this episode as we strive to bring awareness and change to this issue. Spread the word.

Lindsey opens up about her traumatic childhood experiences of manipulation, extreme discipline, and psychological abuse that left her anxious and struggling with PTSD. As a child, Lindsey felt unheard, afraid, and starved of creativity and authentic self-expression, but maintained an inner fire. Now empowered, Lindsey uses her voice to expose IBLP\u2019s tactics and bring hope to other victims seeking to break free. Her journey truly inspired us on Prey VS Predator and epitomizes the strength of the human spirit we love to highlight on our podcast. This is a must-listen for anyone who wants to understand spiritual abuse and the courage it takes to break out. We hope you enjoy the episode!

We dig in to the outright manipulation and lack of responsibility shown by the Duggar parents, as well as the larger issues of systemic abuse enabled and perpetuated by the religious institution. We also explore the culture of victim-blaming, and share our own experiences dealing with spiritual abuse. Join us as we break down how predators maintain control by creating a community of perfect prey. Our hope is that by speaking out we can giver others a language to put this kind of abuse and thereby reclaim their voices through this understanding. Victims NEED A VOICE, predators HAVE to be held ACCOUNTABLE, and as prey, we have to learn to trust our own instincts.

After watching the documentary \u0022Shiny Happy People\u0022, we knew we had to cover the fascinating and terrifying dynamics uncovered by this series. And, so, we begin a series of enlightening discussions about the controversial Duggar family. In this first video, we analyze the manipulative coercion and control tactics used in the Duggar\u0027s religious cult. Drawing from our own experiences, we explain how many mainstream churches subtly promote similar values that can enable abuse. We break down how fear, loving moments, isolation, and punishment are used to control victims and force obedience. Finally, we examine how predators exploit prey\u0027s innocence and desire for connection. We hope our discussion provides some insight into recognizing and challenging religious systems of abuse. Victims NEED A VOICE, predators HAVE to be held ACCOUNTABLE, and as prey we have to learn to trust our own instincts.

      "description": "Did you know that establishing healthy boundaries can protect you from emotional abuse? Welcome back to Prey VS Predator, and part 2 of our series on boundaries! In this episode of our podcast, we dive into the importance of maintaining healthy boundaries in relationships, and how this can be an essential tool for prey to protect themselves from abuse. We explore predatory tactics like \u0027hoovering\u0027, used to lure the prey back into relationships, and unpack the distinction between accidental VS deliberate boundary violations. Acknowledging and respecting each other\u0027s boundaries is an undeniable part of any healthy relationship, and while it can be incredibly hard to uphold your own boundaries, it really is necessary for self-protection and self-respect. If you\u0027re in a relationship with a predator, understanding the dynamics of boundaries can not only be useful for self-protection, but it can also help you identify early signs of predatory behaviour that lead to abuse, such as anger, rage, resentment and rejection.

In this episode of Prey VS Predator, we do a deep dive into the importance of setting healthy personal boundaries as a safeguard against predators. Parental and societal influences mould our perception of boundaries for good and ill. Among other things, we explore the difference between real boundaries and pseudo-boundaries, the complications of boundary-setting, and share our personal experiences of setting boundaries, and how it is both easier and harder than you think Remember, prioritizing self-love and recognizing your value is key to maintaining emotional health.

In this episode of Prey VS Predator, we conclude our series with our guest Sophia. As we wrap up the conversation, Sophia shares the difficulty of confronting her community about her abusive husband\u0027s behaviour and the loss of many friends that followed this disclosure. Throughout this final chapter of our conversation, we explore the role of justice, compassion, and accountability when dealing with predators, especially in significant institutions such as the church. Sophia also stresses the importance of building mutually respectful relationships and the necessity of having an exit strategy and a supportive team when dealing with a controlling partner. This episode is filled with powerful insights about healing from abuse, setting boundaries, and recovering from abuse. If you\u0027re battling with similar experiences or know someone who is, Sophia\u2019s story will definitely resonate... but also offer some hope. Don\u2019t forget to reach out if you need help, and remember, you are not alone.

      "description": "Welcome back Sophia! In this episode of Prey VS Predator, we continue to explore Sophia\u0027s harrowing journey of abuse. Sophia shares her experiences of spousal abuse and how the simplistic messaging she received from her religious community, messaging about unconditional love and self-sacrifice in marriage, perpetuated the cycles of abuse. In this conversation, we do a deep dive with Sophia into the alarming power dynamics within religious institutions, and how this power is often rooted in a misguided loyalty to a narcissistic and predatory leader. This is an episode you do NOT want to miss. *********************************************** PREY VS PREDATOR Follow us on for regular updates and words of encouragement!

      "description": "Darrell, a man, was the victim of domestic abuse, trapped in an abusive marriage, witnessing the abuse of his children. Now, in the aftermath of his divorce, Darrel struggles under the confusion and disorientation himself, even as he finds a new lease on life. Darrel\u0027s story proves that the predator and prey roles aren\u2019t strictly gendered. Men can be prey and women can be predators. In fact, given the tight-lipped default most men have concerning emotional issues, this is likely more common than we know. In this episode we explore Darrell\u2019s story, the red flags he feels he should have noticed in his ex, and how he finally managed to break free from his partner. We are so grateful for Darrel\u0027s willingness to share his story and be vulnerable with us.

This is Jill\u0027s story of intimate partner abuse. Jill\u0027s story is heartbreaking. Throughout her first marriage, her husband slowly showed himself to be a predator. But his abusive behaviour didn\u0027t start after they got married. According to Jill herself, her ex\u0027s predatory tendencies were clear to everyone around her... but not to her. Why? Why is it so hard to see the toxic behaviours in our partners? Why does it remain difficult even while we\u0027re in the middle of abuse? Why can we remain blind to it even while others, especially our kids, are telling us the person is no good? In this episode we explore the complexities of spousal abuse and how, even in the midst of abuse, there is hope.

Especially when you are already trying to distance yourself from your predator, setting up your own boundaries for self-care, how can you help your kids process and navigate their relationship with the predator when, quite often, it\u0027s not possible to cut ties completely? In this episode, we explore what a parent can do to support their child. Although you won\u0027t be able to protect them from abuse, you can help your children by working to be the best version of yourself, creating a safe place for your kids to experience their emotions, and working with your kids to develop a language for understanding their experiences.

How does it impact their brain? How should we, as parents and trauma victims ourselves, raise them to be as resilient and healthy as possible? For this episode we are excited to welcome back Dr. Christine Cocchiola! Dr. Cocchiola is a licensed clinical social worker, college professor and all-around advocate for victims of intimate partner abuse. As a survivor of spousal abuse, Dr. Cocchiola works to educate and research Coercive Control, including child maltreatment and trauma. Her expertise is in the areas of intimate partner violence, trauma, and child abuse, developing and presenting workshops on these topics both nationally and internationally. She is also the creator of the Protective Parenting Program, a program aimed at supporting protective mothers on their journey of healing their children. In this episode, we explore how our language of \u201Cprey\u201D and \u201Cpredator\u201D map onto Dr. Cocchiola\u2019s research and dive deep into the language of Coercive Control.

      "description": "What is Coercive Control? How does it relate to psychological abuse? How can we put a language to trauma? For this episode, we are really excited to welcome Dr. Christine Cocchiola. Dr. Cocchiola is a licensed clinical social worker, college professor and all-around advocate for victims of intimate partner abuse. As a survivor of spousal abuse, Dr. Cocchiola works to educate and research Coercive Control, including child maltreatment and trauma. Her expertise is in the areas of intimate partner violence, trauma, and child abuse, developing and presenting workshops on these topics both nationally and internationally. She is also the creator of the Protective Parenting Program, a program aimed at supporting protective mothers on their journey of healing their children. In this episode, we explore how our language of \u201Cprey\u201D and \u201Cpredator\u201D map onto Dr. Cocchiola\u2019s research and dive deep into the language of Coercive Control. We hope you enjoy the conversation. // ABOUT DR.

      "description": "Amber experienced parental abuse. Her predator was her parent, her mother, and now, as an adult, she struggles with the reality of her trauma. Amber is one of our three courageous hosts. Besides being a performer, artist and coach, Amber\u2019s story and perspective is unique because her predator and emotional abuser is a parent. Amber\u2019s story undermines any notion that we can simply avoid these relationships. In fact, her experiences felt so normal that it took an outsider saying, \u201COh, it sounds like you were emotionally abused\u201D for things to click. And, worse still, she has to engage with her abuser on a regular basis. In this episode, Amber offers some great advice on how PREY can minimize the impact PREDATORS have on their lives, particularly in cases of parental abuse. Does any of what we discuss sound familiar?

It\u0027s also quite common for prey in these relationships to justify their predator in all sorts of ways, excusing their behaviors and accepting the narrative they\u2019re they\u0027re spinning: YOU\u2019RE the problem. YOU\u2019RE being selfish. YOU\u2019RE not taking THEM into consideration. So, amidst the confusion of gaslighting, love-bombing, flips and outright lies, how on earth can you tell if you\u2019re actually being abused?

      "description": "Bren\u00E9 Brown, a powerful voice in the area of emotional abuse, often says that to people, your story is not for everyone. Sharing our story can be an incredibly vulnerable thing. It opens us up and exposes us to the judgement of others, which is not something we should do lightly, especially as prey - victims of emotional abuse - who are eager to remove any barriers to deeper relationships. It\u0027s also dangerous to accept the narratives others have created for us, which is something predators do to maintain control. Being able to see and name this control tactic can help prey regain power over their identity and grow into greater confidence and self-assurance.

In this episode we explore our own stories and all the complexities of \u201Cwhy not just leave\u201D? Does this sound familiar? We would love to hear your story.

      "description": "What is emotional abuse? What does it look like when there are no bruises or broken arms? Have you ever been told by a partner, friend or family member, \u0022I know you better than you know yourself\u0022? What about \u201Cyou don\u2019t have my best interests at heart\u201D? Do you feel constantly gaslit, misled or made to feel inferior and unworthy of love? It may seem benign and unintentional, but when these are patterns of behaviour (they are consistent and persistent) they become more than just momentary lapses in judgement or careless words - they become tactics used to shut up and shut down. Seeing these patterns can help us avoid these relationships or navigate them more effectively when we have to. Does this sound familiar? We would love to hear your story.

In the language we use on our podcast, she is a quintessential \u2018prey\u2019: kind, thoughtful and people-oriented.

Amber, one of our hosts on this podcast, discusses how her mother used this phrase to control and manipulate - to tell her who she was and what she could accomplish. One of the most powerful ways predators control their prey is by imposing themselves on their prey\u2019s story. They can do this by laying claim to an insider\u2019s knowledge of another person, saying things like, \u201CI know you better than you know yourself\u201D. Amber experienced this with her mother who was constantly telling her who she was, her flaws and failures, and diminishing her successes. It may seem benign but this simple strategy is a powerful way predators shut up and shut down their prey. Does this sound familiar? We would love to hear your story.
