      "description": "A Nigerian senator who alleged she was sexually harassed by one of the country\u0027s top politicians has told the BBC the Senate operates like a \u0022cult\u0022.\n\nA fortnight ago, Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan was suspended for six months after submitting a petition saying she had been harassed by Senate President Godswill Akpabio, which he denies.\n\nHis office also rejected the cult comparison - the latest twist in a row that has gripped Nigeria, raising questions about gender equality in the socially conservative nation.\n\nAkpoti-Uduaghan said she was being punished for speaking out against the system and that she now feared for her and her two-year-old\u0027s safety as her security detail had been stripped.\n\n#bbcafrica #natashaakpoti #nigerianews \n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/subscribetoafrica\r\nWebsite: https://www.bbc.com/africa\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/bbcnewsafrica/\r\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/bbcafrica/\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bbcafrica/",
