      "description": "In this episode of DisAllusioned Podcast, host Ari Sherwood speaks with Geoff Etherton, a former youth pastor in the Church of England, about his experiences in the church and the creation of Church Abuse Survivor\u0027s Day. Geoff was a pioneer in the church, and with creative freedom, he was able to establish a coffee shop in the church as a means for meaningful engagement with the public, regardless of religious beliefs. With a sudden change in leadership, he was quickly thrown into coercive dynamics. He discusses the challenges faced within church leadership, the failure to address abuse cases, and the church\u0027s perspectives and criticisms of mental health, detailing his experiences being pushed out of ministry for having depression. Geoff shares his personal journey of deconstruction and the significance of community support for those who have experienced church abuse. This led Geoff to start Church Abuse Survivor\u0027s Day, in order to give recognition, validation, and solidarity to those who have survived religious abuse.

      "description": "In this episode of the DisAllusioned Podcast, host Ari Sherwood continues her series into the philosophy behind cults, focusing on the concepts of authority and autonomy, tackling some foundational questions: What makes authority legitimate? Why should we obey authority? And can a cult be a legitimate authority? Ari gives an introduction into the philosophy of authority and the various philosophical perspectives, including those of Thomas Hobbes, Immanuel Kant, Plato, and John Stuart Mill, examining what makes authority legitimate and the moral obligations individuals have towards it. Ari emphasizes the importance of personal agency and the challenges faced by cult survivors in reclaiming their autonomy. Understanding what authority is, the relevance of autonomy and consent in legitimating authority, and the variations in philosophical approaches can help you in your own deconstruction and recovery process. \n\nThank you for watching DisAllusioned Podcast!
