      "description": "In this episode of the DisAllusioned Podcast, host Ari Sherwood continues her series into the philosophy behind cults, focusing on the concepts of authority and autonomy, tackling some foundational questions: What makes authority legitimate? Why should we obey authority? And can a cult be a legitimate authority?

Ari emphasizes the importance of personal agency and the challenges faced by cult survivors in reclaiming their autonomy. Understanding what authority is, the relevance of autonomy and consent in legitimating authority, and the variations in philosophical approaches can help you in your own deconstruction and recovery process. \n\nThank you for watching DisAllusioned Podcast!
