      "description": "Rachael Reign was 13 years old when she joined what she thought was a youth group\u2026 the next eight years of her life were dedicated to an organisation that she describes as a \u0027cult\u0027. We spoke to Rachael about her experience in the UCKG - a church with over 30 locations in the UK that has been accused by Rachael and other ex-members of dangerous, cult-like behaviour. The UCKG states that they are not a cult - and it is a registered charity in the UK. Rachael told us about her years within the church - the effect it has had on her life, the fear she felt around leaving and why she has created the UK\u2019s only black-led specialist support group for fellow survivors.
