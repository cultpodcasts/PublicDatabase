      "description": "Charles Milles Manson was born on November 12, 1934, in Cincinnati, Ohio. From the beginning, Manson\u0027s life seemed destined for chaos and marginalization. His mother, Kathleen Maddox, was only 16 years old when she gave birth, and Manson\u0027s father, Colonel Walker Scott, never officially acknowledged him.",
