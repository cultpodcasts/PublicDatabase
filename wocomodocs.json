      "description": "Helg Sgarbi, an attractive Swiss man, tries to extort 14 million Euro from BMW\u2019s major shareholder Susanne Klatten by threatening to publish intimate photos. Susanne Klatten, however, isn\u0027t afraid: the richest woman in Germany contacts the police and her blackmailer is arrested. The story goes public, and it turns out that this case is only the tip of the proverbial iceberg.\n\nSubscribe to wocomoDOCS: https://goo.gl/sBmGkp\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/wocomo\n\n\u00A9 2012, Licensed by First Hand Films\n\nThe money Sgarbi obtained through seducing and blackmailing several rich women most likely went directly to an Italian miracle healer named Ernani Barretta, and to his sect. Is Barretta really the mastermind behind the blackmailings?\nDuring the investigation, the Italian Barretta is also questioned but released due to lack of evidence. Who is this man who had been Sgarbi\u0027s friend for many years? Barretta first emerged as a \u0022miracle healer\u0022 in Zurich where Sgarbi had initially joined him.\nWhen Sgarbi is sentenced to six years in prison in Munich, one question remains unanswered: what happened to the millions? The trial against Barretta is still ongoing.",
