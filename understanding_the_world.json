      "description": "\uD83D\uDC49SUBSCRIBE : https://bit.ly/3Z5de2S \nIn this video, we explore five countries that have banned Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and investigate why governments have taken such drastic measures against this religious group. From Russia\u2019s declaration of \u201Cextremism\u201D to Singapore\u2019s strict national service laws, Tajikistan\u2019s legal crackdown, Eritrea\u2019s harsh repression, and Turkmenistan\u2019s refusal to recognize them, we reveal the political, cultural, and legal reasons behind these bans.\nJehovah\u2019s Witnesses are known worldwide for their door-to-door ministry, neutrality in politics, and refusal of military service. But in these countries, those same beliefs have led to imprisonment, loss of rights, and the complete outlawing of their communities.\nThis documentary-style video provides historical background, real cases of persecution, and the broader implications for freedom of religion and human rights. Whether you are studying world religions, human rights, or international politics, this video will give you a clear, factual overview of how and why Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses face bans in certain nations.\nDon\u2019t forget to like, share, and subscribe for more deep dives into global issues, faith, and freedom.\n\uD83D\uDCD6 Sources:\nHuman Rights Watch \u2013 https://www.hrw.org\nUSCIRF \u2013 United States Commission on International Religious Freedom \u2013 https://www.uscirf.gov\nWikipedia \u2013 Persecution of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses \u2013 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Jehovah%27s_Witnesses\nHRWF \u2013 Human Rights Without Frontiers \u2013 https://hrwf.eu\nUnited Nations Human Rights Committee \u2013 https://www.ohchr.org",
