During India\u0027s six-week election, voters and poll workers endured deadly heat waves, and vocal critic Arvind Kejriwal was sent to prison on corruption charges. This comes as Modi\u0027s opponents have accused the prime minister of using hate speech after he described Muslims in India as \u0022infiltrators.\u0022 Meanwhile, journalists who are critical of Modi have been expelled, investigated and raided by his government.
