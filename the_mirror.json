      "description": "A survivor of child sexual abuse has accused the Metropolitan Police of failing to bring a paedophile detective to justice, alleging he was protected because of Freemason links. John Hudson, a former Met detective sergeant, abused Marina Narayan from the age of six after fostering her as a baby. Despite being reported to police on three occasions, Hudson was never charged.\n\nThe case was uncovered by the Shirley Oaks Survivors Association and has renewed scrutiny of Freemasonry within policing. Relatives claimed Hudson was a Freemason and boasted of being tipped off by colleagues during investigations. Marina, now 60, has waived her anonymity to highlight what she says is a long-standing culture of secrecy and protection that denied victims justice.\n\nHer comments follow Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley\u2019s decision to require officers to declare Freemasonry membership, after intelligence suggested secret networks may have influenced misconduct cases. The Met accepts Hudson was never prosecuted and says the allegations underline the need for greater transparency and accountability.\n\nThe Mirror Facebook: http://facebook.com/dailymirror\nThe Mirror IG: http://instagram.com/dailymirror\nThe Mirror TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dailymirror\nThe Mirror Twitter: http://twitter.com/DailyMirror\nThe Mirror Homepage:  https://www.mirror.co.uk\n\nSign up for our newsletters: https://www.mirror.co.uk/email\n\n#metpolice #crime #freemasons",
