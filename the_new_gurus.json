      "description": "After The New Gurus was released, there was one question Helen Lewis was asked far more than any other: why are so many gurus men? Stuck for an answer, she journeys into the world of the Manosphere - home to \u0027Gigachads\u0027 and \u0027Sigma Wolves\u0027.   Joining Helen on her journey is a reporter who once got (consensually) punched by the world\u0027s most Googled man, Andrew Tate, plus the former Love Island contestant and now successful podcaster, Chris Williamson. Helen also takes to the mat to find out why three of her original subjects - Sam Harris, Joe Rogan and Russell Brand - all studied the same hardcore martial art.   What do men want? The answer, it seems, is very long podcasts.

How to get rich. How to manage our time.   Across 8 episodes, Helen Lewis travels through the strange, powerful and sometimes hidden digital spaces created by these new gurus. Where did they come from? How much power do these charismatic individuals wield? And why are so many of us turning away from the mainstream \u2014 mainstream medicine, mainstream politics and the mainstream media - and embracing the power of charismatic individuals instead?
