      "description": "After The New Gurus was released, there was one question Helen Lewis was asked far more than any other: why are so many gurus men? Stuck for an answer, she journeys into the world of the Manosphere - home to \u0027Gigachads\u0027 and \u0027Sigma Wolves\u0027.   Joining Helen on her journey is a reporter who once got (consensually) punched by the world\u0027s most Googled man, Andrew Tate, plus the former Love Island contestant and now successful podcaster, Chris Williamson. Helen also takes to the mat to find out why three of her original subjects - Sam Harris, Joe Rogan and Russell Brand - all studied the same hardcore martial art.   What do men want? The answer, it seems, is very long podcasts.

David Fuller was one of those who found this loose grouping of dissident gurus like Jordan Peterson, Joe Rogan and Sam Harris intoxicating \u2013 enough to leave the mainstream media and start his own YouTube channel.

      "description": "At Oxford University, fellow students remember Tom Ralis as a quiet, nerdy biology student who played percussion in the college orchestra. But even then, he had one ambition - to become a guru.   He reinvented himself as Tom Torero, a pick-up artist who approached women in the street for dates - a practice known as \u201Cdaygame\u201D. His transformation led to tragedy.  The New Gurus is a series about looking for enlightenment in the digital world.

How to get rich. How to manage our time.   Across 8 episodes, Helen Lewis travels through the strange, powerful and sometimes hidden digital spaces created by these new gurus. Where did they come from? How much power do these charismatic individuals wield? And why are so many of us turning away from the mainstream \u2014 mainstream medicine, mainstream politics and the mainstream media - and embracing the power of charismatic individuals instead?   Along the way, she considers the dubious benefits of \u2018butthole sunning\u2019, seeks help from some productivity gurus, meets a crypto millionaire who bought a football team, and wonders if the architecture of the internet will always drive us to extremes.
