      "title": "97: Overcoming Attachment Trauma in Relationships: A Conversation with Lou Lackman",
      "description": "In this episode of Revolutionise Your Love Life, Heather speaks with therapist Lou Lachman about how early attachment experiences shape adult relationships and self-connection. Lou shares their history of rotating caregivers within a cult, how that fracture in attachment led to people-pleasing and self-erasure in love, and the practices that now support authentic relating. They discuss the fawn response, learning to speak needs without fear, parts work, and becoming your own \u201Cmarriage arranger\u201D so choices come from an adult, regulated place rather than from younger parts. Key takeaways: Early attachment informs both how we connect to others and how we connect to ourselves. Repairing self-attachment requires time, practice, and compassionate awareness. The fawn response looks like saying whatever keeps the peace. It prevents truth, blocks differentiation, and slowly erodes intimacy. Parts work helps identify the age and need behind a reaction. Lou\u2019s Heart Holding practice meets that part with reassurance, which creates space for adult choice. Be your own marriage arranger. Choose partners who align with your values, help you feel larger and steadier, and can tolerate ordinary conflict. Healing is amplified in community. Small, facilitated circles provide co-regulation, shared courage, and faster integration. About Your Host: Heather has been working in mental and emotional health for over 30 years.
