      "description": "Thirty years ago this week, a fire broke out at a compound occupied by an apocalyptic cult outside Waco. The blaze ended a weeks-long standoff between federal authorities and the Branch Davidians. As it turned out NewsRadio 1080 KRLD in Dallas-Fort Worth played a central role in the early days of the standoff. News anchor Mike Rogers covered the standoff for KRLD and recounts his memories of the weeks spent in Central Texas. Then, therapist Rachel Bernstein, who specializes in cults and hosts a weekly podcast about them called\u00A0IndoctriNation, explains what draws people into these types of groups.",
