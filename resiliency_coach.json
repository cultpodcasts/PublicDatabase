      "title": "Episode 29 Raised In A Cult , She was Abused And Suffered Severe PTSD with Lori Christensen",
      "description": "Lori was raised in a cult and severely abused, which she repressed until her late 30\u0027s when she started to have flashbacks and seizures. Now with her new medical condition (flashbacks and seizures) she had to continue to work because she was a single mother needing to raise her children. Doctors didn\u0027t know what to do to help her and in the process misdiagnosed and overmedicated her. Medical professionals told her that she was stuck and she continued to get worst. She was devasted with her medical prognosis. She started off with 2-3 jobs, raising her sons, buying her own home to losing it all. She later found out that she was struggling with PTSD. She struggled with PTSD for many years, but she found a way to heal herself and others. The advice she gives 1. Don\u0027t give up 2. You\u0027re going to find a way 3. You\u0027re not the only one, we\u0027re here for you 4. It\u0027s important to remember the spiritual aspect of your healing Contact information loricayechristensen@gmail.com Facebook Lori Christensen",
