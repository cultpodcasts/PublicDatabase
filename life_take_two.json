Along the way I reference the biblical contrasts between \u201Ckill\u201D and \u201Cmurder\u201D and why that linguistic distinction has been central to debates about the death penalty and just war theory. \n\nThis is not a partisan takedown \u2014 it\u2019s a close read. I\u2019m arguing that language like \u201Cyou should kill those who kill\u201D is corrosive to democratic norms because it simplifies complex ethical questions into a slogan and normalizes vengeance as civic policy. If you care about how rhetoric shapes behavior and what it teaches the next generation about justice, this is for you. \nYouTube\n\nIf this video landed for you, like and subscribe for more cultural analysis.

We will be LIVE here in my channel Saturday Oct 11th at noon Pacific Time.\n\nChris\u0027s website:\n\nhttp://www.volpeforamerica.com/\n\nTed Talk:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPIQfdoIWxM\n\nTo donate to the campaign:\n\nhttp://www.volpeforameriac.com/donate\n\nIntroduction and Podcast Overview\nI\nMeet Chris Volpe: A Regular Joe with Big Dreams\nToday, I have a guest that I\u0027ve been so excited to talk to, and I am thrilled to share his story with you....\nBuilding Communities and the Denim Revolution\nSo right now, I, I do, before we logged on, when we were in the, uh, the quote unquote green room, we were joking about how, uh, we all have like, multiple jobs....\nChris Volpe\u0027s Journey: From Healthcare to Gaming\nAdditionally, , I\u0027m a teacher....\nThe Insulting Assumptions About Students\nWhat they\u0027re really telling you , as a student is that they think you\u0027re an idiot....\nChris\u0027s Political Awakening\nWhen was the moment?...\nTrump\u0027s Influence and Manipulation\nI really have ramped up my understanding of the political world, to be honest, since Donald Trump became president the first time....\nPersonal Reflections on Voting and Politics\nI was voting for Trump on a vibe because I did vote for Trump first election....\nTrump\u0027s Strategy and Public Perception\nI think, I think he\u0027s smarter than we realize....\nThe Narcissistic Traits of Trump\nThis is coming from narcissists....\nChaos and Confusion as a Political Tool\nwhen you\u0027re dealing with con men, one of the key things that they do is that they try to create chaos and confusion....\nThe Smoke and Mirrors of Trump\nI did a video recently where I say that Donald Trump is the wizard of DC and it\u0027s all smoke and mirrors and absolutely I think that that\u0027s what a lot of people, so that\u0027s exactly what you\u0027re talking about....\nThe Impact of Trump\u0027s Actions on Society\nHe just does not, he does not care about you....\nPolarizing Issues: Abortion and Beyond\nAnd so we are actually all in line with certain things., There\u0027s a lot of interesting conversations, which these abortion here for a second as an example, the vast majority of pro-life people are actually pro-choice....\nThe Death Penalty Debate\nI think the death penalty should cease to exist....\nChris\u0027s Senate Run and Public Engagement\nI\u0027d like to double back to what got you into your current state of running for office and Sure....\nProtecting Trans Rights and Fixing the Economy\nWe\u0027re gonna make sure that we protect trans rights....\nVision for America\u0027s Future\nAnd I have a vision, and I think a lot of Americans, it\u0027s, it\u0027s the moms too....\nChallenges of Political Leadership\nI could have a hour long plus conversation about the Democratic Party with you, and I think we could make some interesting, clips outta that because I, I share that, and one of the things that I, I like to remind people as I use the phrase I\u0027m running as a Democrat, which as opposed to I am a Democrat, because I do not, I do not tie my sense of identity in with a political party....\nEconomic Inequality and Corporate Responsibility\nAnd I, one of the things I, I\u0027ve mentioned before, uh, I\u0027ve said this on an interview maybe a month ago, but I was like, when is the last time that you think that John Husted, or even like someone like Jared Brown, who\u0027s, who\u0027s running a Democrat, like, when\u0027s the last time most of these politicians have had to worry about paying their rent or covering their groceries,...\nHealthcare and Education Reform\nAnd I think that we have seen since World War II where we did major investments in infrastructure and healthcare, where we really focused on small businesses, and education....\nThe Burden of Existence and Economic Collapse\nMm-hmm. So back to college....\nPersonal Stories of Medical Bankruptcy\nI had a medical bankruptcy....\nThe Role of Corporations in Society\nAnd I just think that in the United States of America, it is disgusting that I. A hardworking family that owns a family business....\nAffordable Housing and Wealth Disparity\nSo this idea we\u0027re not capable of utilizing money for the, pretty much everything that you were talking about there, that we can\u0027t find the money to provide healthcare or we can\u0027t rebuild our educational system into something that is, the envy of the world....\nThe Need for Radical Accountability\nIf you wanted to, reduce me down to, a couple things....\nGrassroots Campaign and Final Thoughts\n, Every dollar helps and I don\u0027t take any lobbyist or corporate money, so I\u0027m doing 100% grassroots support....\nClosing Remarks and Future Plans\nSo Chris and I will be going live....\n\n#jdvance #ohio #trump #maga #denimrevolution #america #politics #democrat #republican #governmentshutdown #feminist #liberal #workingclass",

This video pulls back the curtain on why the movement feels so polished and nostalgic, how it hides power, and why controlling women\u2019s bodies and choices is less about \u201Csubjugation\u201D and more about system replication.\n\nWe\u2019ll talk about:\n\nThe soft-focus marketing of domesticity vs. the hard math of power\n\nHow racial \u201Cpurity\u201D myths and demographic panic fuel the aesthetic\n\nProject 2025, and why policy always follows propaganda\n\nWhat real freedom looks like for women, families, and communities\n\nHow we build something healthier\u2014local, mutual, and human\u2014together\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever felt that tug of cozy nostalgia and the chill of your autonomy shrinking, this one\u2019s for you.

They happened to teenage girls.\n\nI\u2019m not one of Epstein\u2019s 1,000\u002B victims, but I am a survivor of other terrible men. And like them, people only see me as the 51-year-old grandmother I am today \u2014 confident, safe, thriving. What they don\u2019t see is the 14-year-old, 19-year-old, 22-year-old girl who lived through it.\n\nThis video is a plea: look past the woman on the screen and see the child behind her. Until we stop normalizing cruelty, until we believe women and protect girls, we are letting monsters run the world.\n\n\uD83D\uDC49 If you\u2019re a survivor, you are not alone.\n\uD83D\uDC49 If you\u2019ve ever been told to \u201Cmove on,\u201D this video is for you.\n\nBYU  man who received no jail time for horrific crimes:\n\nhttps://kutv.com/news/local/former-byu-baseball-player-sentenced-in-child-sexual-assault-case\n\nTo follow the incredible Robert Arnold:\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT638caQe/\n\nRobert\u0027s book is here:\n\n\nMy NPR interview is here:\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2024/12/17/nx-s1-5206673/tradwives-have-taken-over-tiktok-now-ex-tradwives-want-their-moment\n\n00:00 The Illusion of Justice\n00:34 Trump and Epstein: A Dark Connection\n01:09 The Silence of the Powerful\n02:19 A Survivor\u0027s Perspective\n04:08 The Weight of Trauma\n04:49 Empathy and Understanding\n07:43 The Invisibility of Scars\n10:40 The Monster Code\n21:50 Sympathy for the Villains\n25:09 A Call to Action\n\n#metoo #epstein #Trump #maga #epsteinsurivors #america #republican #unitedstates #victimsrights #feminist #exmormon #exmaga #lifetaketwo #democrat #woke #mormon",

      "description": "There is a reason why most women NEVER speak up about domestic violence: they\u0027re afraid. Afraid of retaliation, afraid of being blamed, afraid of not being believed, afraid of what people will think fo them if they know. \n\nEvery day for almost 6 years I have faced these fears and more, and have told my story DESPITE the fear, despite the threats, despite the personal cost of speaking.\n\nI was deeply inspired by Tarana Burke who said that her story WAS the power for change, and sparked the #metoo movement with her book. I decided it was time for a domestic violence me too, #metooathome I called it for a minute. There is so little meida about relational abuse, and my story was horrifying and tragic, but with a happy ending that softened it. Sharing my life has changed the lives of more people than I can keep track of, and it\u0027s been amazing to be part of empowering women. But it has NEVER BEEN EASY.\n\nBeing attacked by a heavily funded Mormon podcast for sharing the darkest, most terrifying moments of my life, a forced marriage to a stranger and the resulting decades of domestic terrorism, is despicable. These people lack concern, professionalism, and a soul.\n\nMy substack article about the day I realized I could not escape abuse:\n\nhttps://open.substack.com/pub/lifetaketwo/p/the-trad-wife-trap?r=35knav\u0026utm_medium=ios\n\nVideo where I read a letter from my ex mom-in-law to Jake telling him to stop abusing me:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/00uuQ-X3rpc?si=PhxhsDz34mhWXr0n\n\n#metoo #domesticviolenceawareness #marriage #mormon #exmormon #tradwife #wedding #feminist #liberal #MAGA #trump #churchofjesuschristoflatterdaysaints #lds #Utah #cults #divorce #survivor",

      "description": "Today a huge,  generously funded Mormon podcast released a hit piece on me. \n\nFor 24 years, I was the victim of brutal, life threatening domestic violence at the hands of a returned missionary who I was forced by my bishop to marry after he harmed me on our second date. \n\nI make very little money for sharing my story and shinding a light on domestic violence. I have always shared endless letters and voice recordings, screenshots, diary entries, and other private documents to bring to life the daily world of someone who lives with a dangerous man, and I have been as vulnerable and raw as possible because THINGS NEED TO CHANGE, and the only tool I have to bring any change about IS my lived experience. \n\nAnd today, today my life and my very transparent and utterly consistent story was targeted in defense of the Mormon church. \n\nThe tool of victim shaming and targeted defamation is intended to support the patriarchy in question, and was done with no concern at all for me. \n \nI am not a public figure. I don\u2019t have a crew that edits and scripts for me. I am one lone victim with a camera and a ring light dedicated to shining a light on relational abuse, and I am being targeted and harassed by a huge platform that represents the multi hundreds of billions of dollars Mormon church. \n\nBy the way I have read and posted the complete letter from my mom a hundred times at least.  I only hide the personal identifying details. There is NEVER a situation in which it\u2019s okay for a mom to have her daughter and grandchildren kicked out of their home, and my family has harassed and targeted me for years, long before I had an app called tik tok on my phone, simply because I wasn\u2019t Mormon anymore. \n\nLastly, I was trafficked. By international definition, forced marriages are human trafficking. \n\nThe Ward Radio video:\n\nfile:///var/mobile/Library/SMS/Attachments/6a/10/5E030973-7064-42F9-9FE1-61D007C380B5/5698378078287563825.jpg\n\nArticle about being stuck with a man who had a double life and wanted me dead:\n\nhttps://open.substack.com/pub/lifetaketwo/p/the-trad-wife-trap?r=35knav\u0026utm_medium=ios\n\n\n#domesticviolencesurvivor #abuseawareness #marriage #mormon #divorce #churchofjesuschristoflatterdaysaints #wife #tradwife #sahm #utah #cults #metoo#victimblaming #patriarchy #bullying #lds #exmormon",
