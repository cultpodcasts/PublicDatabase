      "description": "When two children vanish, their mother insists they\u2019re safe; but months later, they\u2019re found buried in the backyard of her new husband, a man who writes doomsday prophecies. In this episode, we unpack the chilling story of Lori Vallow Daybell the so-called \u201CCult Mom\u201D who believed she was chosen by God to lead 144,000 survivors into the end times. From a picture-perfect suburban life to murder charges, secret beliefs, and a trail of suspicious deaths, this case isn\u2019t just about faith gone wrong; it\u2019s about control, delusion, and the cost of blind devotion.
