      "description": "In Japan, the death penalty is done by hanging. Prisoners are only notified about an hour beforehand, and family members find out after the fact.\n\nSo Rika Matsumoto knew that any day, her father might be gone.\n\nHer father was Shoko Asahara, the leader of Aum Shinrikyo, a Japanese doomsday cult. On March 20, 1995, Aum members spread sarin gas in the Tokyo subway system during morning rush hour. 17 people died, and thousands more fell ill. Asahara was arrested, along with several other cult members. Rika was 12 years old.\nAsahara was executed on Friday, 23 years after the attacks.\nA few years ago, Matsumoto had begun to publicly campaign for a retrial for her father, saying that he had been mentally unfit to stand trial.\nBut even now that her father is dead, some people are still asking questions about what happened.\n\nTo see more about how Japan is still dealing with the deadliest attack on Japanese soil since WWII, watch the video above.\n\nSubscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News\n\nCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.com\n\nFollow VICE News here:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews\nTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vicenews\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo",

      "description": "The story of alleged cult NXIVM has all the makings of a binge-worthy docuseries. A secretive leader who allegedly had women branded with his initials, wealthy heiresses who helped finance the organization, and a Hollywood actress accused of luring in fresh recruits.\n\nBut before all that was public, back in 2007, NXIVM, correctly predicting in advance the firestorm of press that lurked ahead, hired Frank Parlato to help with its public relations.\n\nThey hoped he might go after detractors of the group accusing it of being a cult. He ended up exposing the story that made the alleged cult famous: that it had a secret sorority that was branding female \u0022slaves\u0022 with leader Keith Raniere\u0027s initials.\n\n\u0022I turned on an instant and said this is more than a cult. This is a deadly cult. This is more than a kooky group. This is a crazy group, a criminally insane group and it\u0027s not just Raniere,\u0022 Parlato said.\n\nRaniere and actress Allison Mack have since been arrested and face sex trafficking and forced labor charges. Both have pleaded not guilty. \n\nNXIVM denies its a cult and says it\u0027s working with the authorities to demonstrate Raniere\u0027s innocence. Their lawyers wouldn\u0027t comment for this piece.\n\nSubscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News\n\nCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.com\n\nFollow VICE News here:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews\nTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vicenews\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo",
