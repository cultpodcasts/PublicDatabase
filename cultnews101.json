      "description": "Maria Peregolise \nInterviewer: Patrick Ryan\n\nHE FIRST OF ITS KIND - Testimony from a 2nd Generation Adult, Born and Raised in, and Leaving a Cult Leader of The URANTIA Book.\n\nCulted Child is a memoir by the daughter of a Spiritual Prophet - a father who used the theology of The URANTIA Book as a framework for his secret conversations with her. These secrets shared his daily communications and miracles from God... Packed with research references and resources, Culted Child utilizes Peregolise\u0027s turbulent childhood experience as an opportunity to communicate the signs and symptoms of being raised in a Cultic or Manipulative Environment.\n\n\u201CThis harrowing and tragic story speaks to the mind-shattering complexity a child faces in surviving loving and being loved by a malignant narcissist . . . For the many, far more than we realize, who have grown up under the extraordinary control of a powerful, charismatic and deeply delusional parent, Peregolise\u2019s story of survival and ultimate freedom is a revelatory and inspiring gift of hope.\u201D\n\n-- Daniel Shaw, LCSW -- Traumatic Narcissism: Relational Systems of Subjugation, and Traumatic Narcissism and Recovery: Leaving the Prison of Shame and Fear\n\n\u201CCulted Child does indeed read like a novel, made all the more frightening by the fact that it is real. It really happened.\u201D\n-- Ron Burks, PhD -- Damaged Disciples: Casualties of Authoritarian Churches and the Shepherding Movement\n\n\u201CVivid episodes from childhood frame her memories with rational insights she discovered through her research in the cult recovery field. Culted Child shows Maria\u0027s strength of spirit, and will validate others who grew up in coercive families or groups.\u201D\n-- Nori Muster -- Betrayal of the Spirit\n\n\u201C. . . discusses the signs and symptoms of being raised in a cult or narcissistic environment, as well as the fantastical and outlandish content of the controversial book and the effects it has on its followers.\u201D\n-- Rachel Bernstein, LMFT -- IndoctriNATION Podcast\n\n\u201C. . . a marvelous memoir of her heroic struggle to both emerge from her father\u2019s cult and to reveal the story behind the formation of The Urantia Book cult.\u201D\n-- Joe Szimhart, Cult Information Specialist -- Santa Fe, Bill Tate, and Me: How an Artist Became a Cult Interventionist\n\nhttps://cultedchild.com/, Rachel Berstein, IndoctriNATION: Thought Adjusters w/ Maria Peregolise, iGotOut, Art Ascent, Gold Writer Award, ICSA Today.\n\ncultnews101.com",
