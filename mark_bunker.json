      "title": "Missing in Happy Valley (1999)  by Peter Reichelt \u002B Ina Brockmann (Now in 4K)",
      "description": "25. February 1999 - The ARD - German TV film by TV journalists Peter Reichelt and Ina Brockmann about Scientology\u0027s RPF prison camps in USA and Europe:\n\nMissing in the Scientology RPF \u0022Happy Valley\u0022?\nThe reformatories of the Scientologists\nTV - ARD - SWR / NDR / HR / 3 SAT and ORF / 1999 and 2000 - since 2000 various repeats\n\nStuttgart News\nBACKGROUND, 25.02.1999: \nWhen people disappear in the \u0022Happy Valley\u0022 Scientology educates \u0022doubters and failures\u0022 behind barbed wire according to its own methods Stuttgart - Scientology maintains penal camps. Until now, there was hardly any information about it. And certainly no pictures. The Mannheim TV journalist Peter Reichelt has succeeded in tracking down reformatories, so-called RPF\u0027s (Rehabilitation Project Forces) of the Scientology group.\nBy our reporter ANTON NOTZ \nTwo hours by car from Los Angeles, in a desert-like landscape, lies \u0022Happy Valley.\u0022 David Miscavage, the head of Scientology, has built an empire nearby that is as luxurious as it is mysterious. In \u0022Happy Valley,\u0022 however, things are different than in Club Med. Around 100 people from the elite Sea-Org unit have to do their penance here. \u0022The people are real prisoners. They are absolutely not there voluntarily,\u0022 says Gerry Armstrong, ex-coordinator of the Scientology secret service OSA, who says he spent two and a half years in penal camps. \nJesse Prince, formerly the second man in the Scientology leadership behind Miscavage, tells Reichelt on camera what goes on behind barbed wire and video-monitored walls. The camp internees have to work day and night like slaves. Prince also speaks from his own experience. He went through Happy Valley for disobeying orders. \u0022It was absolutely horrible. I slept in a chicken coop on the floor, rattlesnakes and scorpions all around me.\u0022 Hard labor, forced hypnosis, brainwashing - according to dropouts, these are the methods Scientology uses to bring \u0022doubters and failures\u0022 back in line. Not all, but those who are significant for the organization because they know too much or are an important cog in the world-spanning money machine. \nHow one has to rehabilitate oneself in a penal camp in Copenhagen is described by a once high-ranking Scientologist thus: No newspaper, no radio, talking to no one, eating everyone else\u0027s garbage, always working. Everyone is watching everyone else. With \u0022knowledge reports\u0022 one blackens the others. The Californian penal camp inside Miscavage\u0027s golden cage has another special feature, which Peter Reichelt discovered during a flight over the area: the \u0022track. Jesse Prince explains: Here, some \u0022deadbeats\u0022 run around a pole for twelve hours in order to become decent Scientologists again. \nPrince has freed himself from the clutches of the cult group. After numerous death threats, he lives separately from his family to protect them. Peter Reichelt and his colleague Ina Brockmann, who were forcibly detained by Scientology members on the open street during filming, have meanwhile completed a film that will be broadcast today at 10:45 p.m. on S\u00FCdwest 3. \nStill living in the \u0022Happy Valley\u0022 is 51-year-old Wiebke Hansen, in Hamburg for ten years one of the most successful Scientology managers worldwide. In 1995, she disappeared without a trace, but her brother Jochen K\u00F6rner is now back in contact with her. He was recently able to visit her for a day in Hollywood. Wiebke Hansen produces advertising films for Scientology. In the evening, she returned to \u0022Happy Valley\u0022 more or less voluntarily. \u0022Re-education camps, we\u0027ve had all that before,\u0022 says Jochen K\u00F6rner, perplexed. \n\nFrankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\nby Michael Hanfeld\n25.02.99 \nHubbard\u0027s Camp\nScientology up close: \u0022Missing in Happy Valley?\u0022 \nWibke H. was high up. She steered the fortunes of her company throughout Germany. In the first years of her work, she was able to report constantly increasing sales to the headquarters in the United States. Her precipitous fall came when new disciples increasingly failed to materialize. This earned her a trip to \u0022Happy Valley,\u0022 where she is probably still today, and where, according to the research of Peter Reichelt and Ina Brockmann, it can hardly be very pleasant. For \u0022Happy Valley,\u0022 according to the findings and the statements of the two television journalists, is a re-education camp where disgraced members of the Scientology organization are kept like slaves and subjected to nasty ordeals. \nA former security chief of the organization, for example, reports on camera how the head of the Scientology security police \u0022SeaOrg,\u0022 David Miscavige, gets rid of disagreeable employees. \nThe authors let the brother of the disappeared Wibke H., with regard to the methods of Scientology described by them, formulate the conclusion: \u0022We\u0027ve been through this before.\u0022",

I wanted to explain why I didn\u2019t think it was necessary to charge the two Scientologists who stole my signs. The financial cost of the yard signs is minor, and they are writing a check to reimburse the campaign, but the cost of eyeballs not seeing my signs leading up to election day is the real harm. Hopefully, getting the story out that Scientologists were so frightened of me winning that they stole the yard signs will make up for some of that damage.",

      "description": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Singer\n\nDr. Margaret Thaler Singer, (1921--2003) was a clinical psychologist and Professor Emeritus of the Department of Psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, U.S.\n\nSinger\u0027s main areas of research included schizophrenia, family therapy, brainwashing and coercive persuasion. Singer performed research at the University of Colorado\u0027s School of Medicine, Walter Reed Army Medical Center Institute of Research, the National Institute of Mental Health, the United States Air Force and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She received many awards for her work, including the Leo J. Ryan Memorial Award, the Research Scientist Award from the National Institute of Mental Health, and both the Hofheimer Prize and the Stanley R. Dean Award from the American College of Psychiatrists.\n\nIn the 1960s she began to study the nature of cults and mind control and served on the board of the American Family Foundation. She is the author of the book Cults in Our Midst. She gave expert testimony in several cult-related trials, including the 1976 trial of Patty Hearst, who had previously been kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army, and the 1977 hearing for five members of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon\u0027s Unification Church.\n\nIn 1987, as head of the APA taskforce on Deceptive and Indirect Techniques of Persuasion and Control for the American Psychological Association, Singer oversaw the production of a report that was later rejected by the APA\u0027s Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology. Thereafter, Singer\u0027s expert testimony in four subsequent cases was not accepted. In 1992 she sued the APA for \u0022defamation, frauds, aiding and abetting and conspiracy\u0022, but in 1994 she lost.\n\nArticles in The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times reported complaints by Singer and her family that she had been enduring harassment and death threats due to her \u0022battles\u0022 with the cults.",

Now conducted under the CCHR\u0027s banner, the campaign currently portrays psychiatry as an \u0022industry of death.\u0022 \r\n\r\n\r\nDemonstrations like the one at this year\u0027s meeting have become a fixture at the annual gatherings. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn this exclusive MedPage Today video report, APA President Nada Stotland, M.D., explains what it\u0027s like for a medical society that has, as she put it, its own dedicated hate group -- the impact on practicing psychiatrists, and how the group has responded.",

      "title": "Scientology: Jeff Stone\u0027s Changing Story",
      "description": "PirateofAnonymous has put together this look at how Supervisor Jeff Stone has railroaded an ordinance into place in Riverside County, California  to try to stop protests at Scientology\u0027s desert compound near Hemet.  \r\n\r\nCalled \u0022Gold,\u0022 this sprawling compound is where Scientology leader David Miscavige lives and rules over the organization.  The gates are constantly guarded, the iron fence covered with spikes and barbed wire to keep members of the Sea Org (Scientology\u0027s elite paramilitary unit) from leaving.\r\n\r\nSea Org members sign a billion-year service contract, pledging to return lifetime after lifetime to work for Scientology to help \u0022clear the planet,\u0022 which means to convert everyone to Scientology.  Some 2% of the population Hubbard described as Suppressive Persons.  SP\u0027s should be eliminated \u0022quietly and without sorrow,\u0022 he wrote.\r\n\r\nSea Org and staff members work about 90 hours a week and get about $50 a week in pay.  They receive one day off every other week unless Scientology feels they are \u0022downstat\u0022 (not producing as much as they did the week before)  in which case they lose that privilege.\r\n\r\nThey are not allowed to come and go as they please, their mail is read and their phone calls are monitored.  They are often cutoff from family members by Scientology\u0027s practice of Disconnection.   If a friend or family raises doubts about Scientology, they are told to handle the \u0022Potential Trouble Source.\u0022  If the member can not shut-up the person complaining, they are forced to write a Disconnection letter, telling them they will never speak to that person again.  This policy tears many families apart and has even done so to the Miscavige family.\r\n\r\nAt one point in the 90\u0027s, the care of babies was causing too many problems for management and slowing work down so a policy of forced abortions was instituted.  If a Sea Org member got pregnant, they were forced to abort the child or get expelled from their post, thus potentially \u0022losing their eternity.\u0022\r\n\r\nIf someone angers management for any reason, they can be put on the Rehabilitation Project Force.  The RFP is a grueling regimen of hard labor, intensive studying of the tech to correct their thinking and isolation form the rest of the members. Those on the RPF are not permitted to speak to anyone unless spoken to.  They are cut off from husbands or wives for months or even years at a time, until management feels they have groveled enough to return to the group.  They have been forced to run around a pole for eight hours a day in the grueling heat as punishment for an offense, and are fed rice and beans.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to just up and leave the Sea Org.  You are expected to \u0022route out\u0022 which can take up to six months or paperwork, confessions and auditing during which time they try to convince you to stay.  Should you flee without permission, they have been known to track people down and drag them back.\r\n\r\nWhether \u0022blowing\u0022 (the process of fleeing) or routing out, a staff or Sea Org member will be hit with a \u0022Freeloader Bill\u0022 in the tens of thousands of dollars for all the courses they received in exchange for the slave labor the member has performed.  Usually frightened by the consequences, the ex-member will generally be unaware that this bill is unenforceable in court.  \r\n\r\nMembers are trained never to go to outside authorities for help.  Any grievance is to be taken to Scientology\u0027s internal justice system, so Scientologists are wary of contacting the authorities with their complaints.  Even if they wanted to, they would not be able to make a complaint without Scientology hearing or reading about it as it happens.\r\n\r\nThese abuses and more are happening in Supervisor Jeff Stone\u0027s jurisdiction, under his watch.  But Stone does nothing to stop them.  Instead he accepts campaign contributions from Scientology\u0027s leader and jumps to propose a new law to stop the public from speaking out about these abuses.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Stone is complicit in the abuse of Scientology\u0027s rank and file members.  He should be ashamed of his actions.",
