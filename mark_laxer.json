Dismayed and seemingly alienated from his Church, Emmanuel journeys around the world in search of his genetic and spiritual origins, identity, and community. The science behind The Monkey Bible is accurate, up-to-date, and accessible, and the reader comes to understand the biological creation story as the adventure unfolds. While The Monkey Bible can be seen as the latest chapter in the larger-than-life debate between Darwinists and creationists, the novel is respectful of both sides, and strives to provide a gentle supportive bridge across which people who disagree can communicate. Ultimately, The Monkey Bible is a timely and necessary plea to alter the stories by which we define ourselves as a way to protect the countless creatures on the great tree of life, upon which all human life depends. The Monkey Bible is a compelling read and the potential audience extends well beyond those interested in biology, anthropology, wildlife conservation, mythology, and religion. Adults will enjoy this book and so will college students, whose fresh questions about their own origins will resonate with this novel. http://www.monkeybible.com/ \n\nUsing The Monkey Bible as inspiration, songwriter Eric Maring has written a companion music CD which uses the varied notion of lines to echo the novel\u0027s themes. The Line--at turns serious, light, joyous, exuberant, and brooding--praises our ability and need to explore our world and to ask questions, especially regarding our relationship to our planet, our religions, and ourselves. \n\n[The Monkey Bible]: \u201C\u2026brings Aldous Huxley into the genetic age.\u201D \n--Richard Wrangham, Harvard University \n\n[Eric Maring\u2019s The Line]: \u201CThe Line produces Graceland like heights of eclecticism and inventiveness, and mirrors the book\u2019s own already lyrical approach to philosophy.\u201D \n--Alexander von Bismarck, Executive Director, Environmental Investigative Agency \n\nEric Maring\u2019s website: https://www.maringmusic.com/\n\nMark Laxer\u2019s third book \nRama Trauma Trump: I Left the Cult and Now Look What Happened is the true story of a young man who falls prey to, then breaks away from, an increasingly authoritative and abusive charismatic leader. The narrative in this highly accessible graphic novel explores the importance of cult-proofing kids, communities, and nations. http://www.ramatraumatrump.com/",
