      "title": "INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION OF CULT TRAUMA",
      "description": "As a result of trauma and ongoing cult control practices, typically, parents who raised their children in cults are living in a cult-induced dissociative state that interferes with their ability to self-reflect and provide an empathic connection with their children. Instead, cult parents are induced to follow the self-serving demands of their leader rather than following their own inclinations. Typically, cultic practices leave their children vulnerable to emotional and physical neglect and abuse. To illustrate this process, the speaker will describe a relationship between a second-generation mother and her third-generation son. To clarify the effects of cult control on the mother-child relationship, the speaker will define dissociation and explore theories of early development, including how the mother-child early relationship impacts the child\u2019s brain and nervous system to provide insight into the third-generation son\u2019s early life experience and the consequences for adulthood.",
