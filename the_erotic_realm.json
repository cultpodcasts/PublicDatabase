      "description": "Bisexual. Celibate. Slave. Survivor.\nIn this episode of The Erotic Realm, I speak with Sergio, a 43 year old bisexual male slave who spent years in a religious cult, and the last four in celibacy.\n\n\nWe talk about erotic reclamation after cult life, redefining intimacy through BDSM, and the complex dance between submission and healing. From shame and silence to power exchange and surrender, Sergio offers a rare, reflective glimpse into the erotic psychology of someone rebuilding from the inside out.\n\n\np.s After recording, I learned that Sergio is now in a healthy and loving BDSM relationship. A beautiful evolution of the story you\u2019ll hear today.\n\n\nWe explore:\n\n     \n     \n  \u2022  What makes someone identify as a slave\u2014not just a submissive\n     \n     \n  \u2022  The psychology of celibacy and erotic suppression\n     \n     \n  \u2022  BDSM as a tool for healing and self-reclamation\n     \n     \n     \n  \u2022  The long arc from indoctrination to intimacy\n     \n     \n     \n  \u2022  Finding erotic power after religious shame\n     \n     \n     \n\nResearch Discussed: I Was Taught to See Sexuality as Something Evil: A Qualitative Study on the Impact of a Cult Childhood on Sexual Development (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Johannes-Jungbauer/publication/374030920_I_was_Taught_to_See_Sexuality_as_Something_Evil_A_Qualitative_Study_on_the_Impact_of_a_Cult_Childhood_on_Sexual_Development/links/650ab236c05e6d1b1c1d40aa/I-was-Taught-to-See-Sexuality-as-Something-Evil-A-Qualitative-Study-on-the-Impact-of-a-Cult-Childhood-on-Sexual-Development.pdf) \n\n\nProudly Sponsored by Captive Collars (https://captivecollars.com/)  Use theeroticrealm10 for $10 off any purchase of $50 or more OR Discount link here.
