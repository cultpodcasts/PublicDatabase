      "description": "Lily is a licensed clinical social worker in private practice in New York City, specializing in disordered eating and body image. \n\nWhen she was in college, Lily fell into a group that she now calls a \u201Cyoga cult.\u201D While the group Lily joined wasn\u2019t a multilevel marketing business per se, you\u2019ll discover through our conversation that it held a lot of similar qualities to MLMs and cults. Fortunately, Lily had a good friend who helped her spot the red flags in this group, and she eventually walked away. Now, Lily is here to discuss her own healing journey and her role as a therapist who helps others heal as well. \n\nConnect with Lily:\nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/thropetherapylcsw/?hl=en) \nWebsite (https://thropetherapy.com/) \nEmail: lily@thropetherapy.com (mailto:lily@thropetherapy.com) \n\n\nFull Soul Nutrition website (https://www.fullsoulnutrition.com/) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport the Show.
