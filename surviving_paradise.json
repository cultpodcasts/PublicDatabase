When the child leaves the organization as an adult, they shift to believing in \u2018spiritual loopholes\u2019 that aren\u2019t true\u2026 and don\u2019t seem to take responsibility for their failure to make little Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.

      "description": "What shocks YOU the most about Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses? I\u2019m often asked that question. The answer probably differs for everyone, but let\u2019s take a look at how millions of people devote themselves to a cult without ever knowing it\u2019s history, reading the Bible or being able to explain their \u2018life or death\u2019 beliefs. How are innocent people held captive to a life of ignorance about their own \u2018religion?\u2019 Why do they choose to bury their heads in the sand on \u2018generations,\u2019 blood, birthdays and more? Why are most JW\u2019s so uneducated, despite being baptized for decades? \u00A0We take a look at how the Governing Body of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses has molded millions of people into followers with a steady dose of fear and complacency that goes back over a century\u2026and keeps millions of publishers coming to your door, unable to answer basic questions about their faith. Don\u2019t worry\u2026 you won\u2019t hear \u201CI\u2019ll need to research that and come back with an answer\u201D\u2026 no \u2018return visits here!#jehovahswitnesses #exjw #exjehovahswitness #watchtower\u00A0TWITTER: @exjwpodcastINSTAGRAM: survivingparadisepodcastTWITTER: @exjwpodcastINSTAGRAM: survivingparadisepodcast",

      "description": "Why would anyone want to leave the \u0027spiritual paradise\u0027 that is Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses? We are prepared to give you well over 144,000 reasons why overlapping generations aren\u0027t a thing, facial hair is normal, Smurfs aren\u0027t demonized ... and Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses are a cult. In our first episode we cover \u0027who is this guy? where did he come from? And why is he starting a podcast now?\u0027With each episode we will laugh, cry, talk old doctrine, the new \u0027religion\u0027 and what it was like to grow up in the 70\u0027s and 80\u0027s as a Jehovah\u0027s Witness. It\u0027s very likely we will stray into hard hitting subjects like the magic of the cheese danish, being a kid in a Kingdom Hall with no windows ... and how some of us went from teenagers chasing girls at District Conventions, to the elders that busted the next generation. Let\u0027s hang out ... heal, laugh, reminisce!\u00A0TWITTER: @exjwpodcastInstagram: @survivingparadisepodcastTWITTER: @exjwpodcastINSTAGRAM: survivingparadisepodcast",
