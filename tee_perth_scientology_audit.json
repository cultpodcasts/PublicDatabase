      "description": "#fsciento\nAn undercover investigation in a Spanish org reveals kids heavily involved and other dodgy stuff!\n\nThe kids in this video are taking part in TR\u0027s\nREAD TO BELOW TO FIND OUT HOW IT AFFECTS THEM\n\nThe Scientology Communications Course (including its Training Routines, or TRs) can have negative effects on child development, particularly in areas of emotional growth, critical thinking, and social interaction.  \n\n1. Emotional Suppression \u0026 Stunted Emotional Development  \n-Children are forced to suppress natural emotions during drills like TR-0 (\u0022Confronting\u0022) and \u0022Bullbaiting\u0022 (where they are insulted or provoked but must remain unreactive).  \n- This can lead to difficulty expressing emotions in healthy ways, making them more prone to bottling up feelings, detachment, or emotional numbness.  \n- Over time, this teaches them to ignore discomfort and accept control, which can increase vulnerability to manipulation and abuse.  \n\n2. Increased Anxiety \u0026 Stress  \n- The rigid, repetitive nature of the drills creates an environment of constant pressure to perform perfectly.  \n- If a child fails a drill, they may be forced to repeat it over and over, leading to frustration, self-doubt, and anxiety.  \n- The high-stress environment can cause fear of failure, affecting confidence and self-esteem.  \n\n3. Loss of Critical Thinking Skills  \n- The course emphasizes rote learning and obedience over independent thinking.  \n- Children are taught to follow instructions without questioning, which can weaken their ability to analyze, debate, or think for themselves.  \n- This conditioning makes them more susceptible to future manipulation, as they learn to accept authority without skepticism.  \n\n4. Distorted Communication \u0026 Social Skills\n- The course does not teach natural communication skills but instead enforces robotic, scripted responses that may seem unnatural in real-life conversations.  \n- Scientology\u2019s version of \u0022communication\u0022 often involves controlling interactions rather than engaging in genuine dialogue.  \n- Over time, children may struggle with normal social cues, empathy, and emotional connection in relationships.  \n\n5. Indoctrination \u0026 Dependency on Scientology \n- The course frames Scientology as the only way to truly \u0022understand\u0022 communication, creating a dependency on its teachings.  \n- Children are conditioned to believe they need more Scientology courses to \u0022advance\u0022, increasing their risk of lifelong involvement.  \n\nThe Scientology Communications Course can negatively impact child development by promoting emotional suppression, increased anxiety, reduced critical thinking, unnatural social skills, and dependency on Scientology. \nIt hinders healthy psychological growth and increases vulnerability to manipulation\u2014potentially affecting them well into adulthood.",
