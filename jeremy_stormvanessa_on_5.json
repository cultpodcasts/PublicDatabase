      "description": "Should Andrew face police investigation?\n\nHe was of course known as Prince Andrew until Buckingham Palace announced last night he will be stripped of that title - he\u0027s also just now been struck off the peerage roll, effectively meaning he\u0027s officially lost his Duke of York title, too.\n\nThe family of Virginia Giuffre, the woman who accused Andrew of sexual abuse before she took her own life earlier this year, say she would be celebrating this news.\n\nBut her brother Sky Roberts told BBC\u0027s Newsnight they want things to go further.\n\nAndrew continues to deny all the allegations Virginia Giuffre made against him, which include sexually abusing her three times when she was 17.\n\nThere are also reports that Andrew handed confidential information about Giuffre to his police bodyguard so he could dig up information to use against her - but he has not commented on these claims\n\nJeremy Vine, Storm Huntley and Vanessa are on television every weekday at 9:15am until 1:30pm on Channel 5. \n\nSubscribe to the channel for more celebrity interviews, hot topics and debates: https://bit.ly/34DvAv4\n\nTwitter:  https://www.twitter.com/jeremyvineon5\nFacebook:  https://www.facebook.com/jeremyvineon5\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/jeremyvineon5\n\n#StormHuntley #PrinceAndrew #RoyalFamily",
