      "description": "Alisha Brache, Lisa M Harrison, Darius J Wright, \u201CAthena\u201D and hundreds of other psychics online are influencers who claim that humans live in a \u201Csimulation\u201D or matrix controlled by dark forces or lower energies that keep us ignorant and trapped. I briefly explore the roots of this recurring theme through some history. I also suggest that every one of these influencers will trap you in a more constricted matrix or world of their own psychic construction while promising to help you escape the big matrix that they define for you. OBEs are nothing more than a disorder called dissociation whether you bring it on consciously through auto suggestion or it happens spontaneously from stress. Teaching people to dissociate to reach the \u201Cother side\u201D is dumb and possibly dangerous.",

St. Augustine of Hippo emphasized grace and faith as well as \u201CGod\u2019s hidden election of those to whom God freely gives the gift of love,\u201D whereas St Thomas Aquinas \u201Cwas committed to the notion that grace goes not destroy nature but perfects it.\u201D (Dictionary of World Religions, K Crim, Ed.). These tendencies lead to conservative and progressive movements respectively. Both tendencies can lead to harmful cult behavior when deception, manipulation, and dispensing of existence occur. Healthy movements employ transparency, education, and a fair means of choosing out.",

I criticize a recent book The Essential Mae Brussell: Investigations of Fascism in America by Alex Constantine (2014). Constantine fits the paranoid conspiracy category in his many books.

      "description": "Cognitive Dissonance theory was tested by Leon Festinger and others in the mid-1950s when researchers infiltrated a small cult that was predicting the end of the world by flood. Their results were published in When Prophecy Fails in 1956. The cult in question was led by Dorothy Martin (1900-1992) who channeled a \u201Cspace brother\u201D called Sananda (the Christ) and Ascended Master Sanat Kumaris. As Sister Thedra, Martin eventually established her group ASSK in Sedona, AZ. \n\nPulitzer Prize winning author Alison Lurie published Imaginary Friends in 1967, a fictional account of When Prophecy Fails. \n\nI was motivated to post this by the recent assault on Congress by the Trump cult which is a mix of paramilitias, QAnon operatives, and citizens gone mad and amuck over a false belief in a \u201Cstolen election.\u201D\n\nCognitive dissonance occurs when disconfirming evidence counters string beliefs. The theory says that rather than change your mind, you will double down and rationalize your strong beliefs even after they are proven false. Indeed, the Sananda cult members for the most part stuck with the group beliefs after the prophecies by Sister Thedra failed several times. \n\nIt is painful to admit to being fooled or being wrong especially after investing a lot of time and effort and sacrifice to hold into a belief. Dangerous behaviors can arise when people who believe in the existence of a \u201Cdeep state\u201D feel cornered by the reality that they have been living in a fantasy world.",

While my parents shopped, I stood transfixed listening to the old man lecture the crowd about living a healthy life and pitching his liniment or tonic for joint and muscle pain. He was at one time early in the century one of the famous strongmen on the carnival and vaudeville circuits known for pulling several cars tied to his hair, breaking chains strapped around his chest by expansion through breath control, biting coins in half, etc. I saw him bend horseshoes and tear phone books in half. \n\nHe was born Yosselle Greenstein to a large and very poor Jewish family in Poland in 1893. Born prematurely, he was not expected to survive. His doctors told his mother that Yosselle at age 14 would likely die by age 18 due to an acute asthmatic condition. Greenstein ran away from home to join Volanko, a strongman wrestler with a Russian circus. Volanko convinced young Yosselle to follow a training regimen that would cure asthma. Greenstein at 5 feet 4 and a half inches as an adult not only overcame asthma, he became one of the famous strongman performers in America. \n\nI talk about Greenstein\u2019s approach to spirituality as a Jew among harsh anti-Semitic factions. \nI reference a book, The Spiritual Journey of Joseph L. Greenstein, The Mighty Atom: World\u2019s Strongest Man by Ed Spielman (1979). Spielman was the Emmy award winning creator of the television series \u201CKung Fu.\u201D",

      "description": "When we were around 5 years old, my friend Bart and I decided to throw stones at the full moon. The neighbor lady yelled at us for throwing stones into her yard. This is an example of a correlation illusion. We experienced (psychologically) that the moon was close to us. \nSee: http://jszimhart.com/blog/stoning_the_moon\n\nThe earliest astrology among Chaldean culture was moon centered, so the moon has influenced our myths, songs, and religions in exceptional ways. Full moons have been correlated to lunacy and the Transylvania Effect or people that believed in the moon cults surrounding vampires and werewolves since the Middle Ages in Europe \n.     If we assign 1 tidal unit to the force the moon has on a baby being born, science shows that the attending doctor\u2019s tidal force is 2,000,000 units and the mother\u2019s is 12,000,000 units!  The hospital building has 7,000,000 units. This is also called the mosquito effect of the moon in humans. I ran the numbers in the psych hospital where I work over a 2-year period and found no difference in average on admission activity on the day of, day before, and day after a full moon compared to any other day. Yet, after 20 years I continue to hear nurses and police officers swear that the full moon increases activity. In fact, more than half of hospital workers believe in a full moon effect.

Moses interpreted his experience of I Am that I Am and gave his people a code to live by, became their hero, but being human had his limits and flaws. I look at the ancient Hindu god Rudra that was an outsider god of destruction that later evolved to become Shiva, perhaps the most revered God among Brahmins today. Shiva as a Hindu high God has numerous cults and hero systems surrounding gurus, some of whom became manipulative narcissists/cult leaders. In other words, an ownership of a God concept can be overvalued. I talk about how this process can become individualized in terrorists like Anders Breivik who killed 77 people in 2011 claiming he was a Knights year Templar and savior of Christianity intending to save Europe from multiculturalism. Psychiatrists changed his initial diagnosis from paranoid schizophrenia to narcissism as a disorder after determining that he was not psychotic. Rather he held\u201Dextreme overvalued beliefs\u201D as a self-appointed hero within a Christian white supremacy hero system. So, God or a concept if god can serve as bait to drag us down the rabbit hole of a promising superior hero system.",

      "description": "During the past two centuries being born-again among many Christian denominations came to mean being saved. The born-again experience is akin to the enlightenment experience we discussed in #13. Being born-again is a form of knowledge, a knowing born of an experience defined by the social context and language in which the experience occurs. I cite I M Lewis from his book Ecstatic Religion, p 5, in his study of shamanism and spirit possession. Around 1990 I attended a weekend retreat for Christian men in New Mexico during which in the final day the session leader led the men in prayer and song. At one stage men began to speak in tongues and prophecy in the manner of charismatic Christians.  Four or five men gathered around me laying on hands appearing to call Jesus to show a sign through his grace that I was saved. I felt uncomfortable with what I saw as an influence technique, so I began to pray aloud in \u201Ctongues\u201D and they quickly pulled away praising God. I was praying in Hungarian. I discuss how the born-again experience can be manipulated by abusive churches referencing The Subtle Power of Spiritual Abuse by Johnson and Van Vonderen (1991) and The Discipling Dilemma by Flavil Yeakley, Jr. editor (1988). I also mention the Twice Born castes in Hinduism by comparison. Again, having a knowledge experience of being born-again or enlightened is no big deal in itself if the context is limiting and harmful.",

      "description": "Varieties of enlightenment as special, occult wisdom or knowledge as gnosis or cosmic awareness or self-realization occur in the claims of gurus, life coaches, mass therapy leaders, and cult leaders. Too often, enlightened teachers feel entitled to behave anyway they want with claims of transcending good and evil with \u201Cnon-dual\u201D awareness. Enlightenment claims come from seekers who have experience with entheogens (god drugs), shamanic techniques and meditation. I argue that enlightenment by itself is hardly special as any teenager can have enlightened spiritual insights comparable to meditation masters by using \u201Cshrooms,\u201D cannabis, and other psychotropics. Many seeker claims of enlightenment point to Buddhism or zen for context. I use Alexandra David-Neel and Werner Erhard as examples of popular, enlightened cult personalities who behaved badly and showed no signs of ethical governance. Pythagoras as guru formed a cult following 2500 years ago at a Greek colony in what was later southern Italy. Despite his genius his commune was elitist and he proved to be inept at general governance, refusing to defer to a more democratic alternative. Locals rebelled against the Pythagoreans, burning a meeting hall. Philosophy, that began with Pythagoras, evolved to cover a vast array of problems generally listed as problems of knowledge, conduct, and governance. Enlightenment is banal when the claimant has no sense of ethical conduct or governance.",

This instinct I had for Cartomancy was spontaneous\u2014no one taught me. Tarot cards have a similar origin as divining tools from a 14th century version of Egyptian playing cards that gained popularity in Europe, especially Italy and France. I use the Rider Deck developed by occultists in the Order of the Golden Dawn in the early 20th Century. Devotees of the cult of Tarot say it has ancient inspiration from the Egyptian god Thoth, an Ibis-headed deity associated with the moon, reckoning, writing, and wisdom. The modern Tarot deck of 78 cards appeared in the 19th Century. Though banned at times in Europe centuries ago due to it both being a form of sorcery as well as a gambling game, today even Christian users see it as a tool to communicate with God, the universe, or the inner self. I warn about bait and switch tactics that online Tarot readers use offering readings at little cost then switching by offering more expensive readings once you are hooked. I recommend reading A Wicked Pack of Cards by Decker, DePaulis, and Dummet (1996) [ https://www.amazon.com/Wicked-Pack-Cards-Origins-Occult/dp/0715627139 ] to get a thorough history of Tarot and its rich connection to the Occulture of the past few centuries.  And I warn that the most important card in the deck is the FOOL which translates to the JOKER in our modern playing cards. Beyond having some fun, don\u2019t be fooled by Tarot!",

      "title": "Astrology: myth for manipulating you",
      "description": "Astrology by most accounts is the queen of the occult arts of divination that include Tarot, Kabbalah, and reading tea leaves. I first seriously explored astrology in the late 1970s, getting my first professional reading of my horoscope from Alan Oken at his Voice of the Turtle gift shop in Santa Fe NM. I needed to know my rising sign, moon and sun signs to apply for entry into the Keeper of the Flame fraternity of a large Theosophy-based sect run then by Elizabeth Prophet. Astrologers seek precise information about birth time and place to better \u201Cread\u201D your star chart or horoscope. After I defected from  Prophet\u2019s cult in 1980, I learned how to cast a horoscope using an ephemeris, then got a good idea how to do a reading from professioal astrologers I knew. One old astrologer told me she only had to glance at a person\u2019s chart to do a reading. \u201CIt is all intuitive,\u201D she said. After two years of research I found that astrology is horrible as a predictive tool and totally unreliable reference as to a person\u2019s character. Astrologers who know how to read a chart with its thousands of relational aspects can easily get most customers to agree with a reading. It comes down to an influence game. Invariably, most people will find accurate information about themselves when tricked into reading the an astrologer\u0027s report on someone else\u0027s chart. Astrology can effect national decisions. I point to how in 1948 the New Indian government had to consult an astrologer for the auspicious moment when to sign their declarations of independence from Great Britain. After Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981, his wife Nancy consulted a celebrity astrology to names dates and times when the president could safely travel, thus causing havoc and unnecessary delays among White House staff decisions. Time Magazine had a cover feature in 1988 about \u201CAstrology in the White House.\u201D I mention that fundamentalist Christians have published books against astrology saying it is deceptive and is a tool of the devil. Skeptics have proven that astrology has no basis in reality, though it remains a popular psychological and cultural means for self reflection among young adults with a resurgence of interest since 2014. I warn that astrology can be easily overvalued and cause harm in relationships as well as decision- making.",

      "description": "In the installment of Cults in the Occulture, I explore the symbolic power of holy grail legends and quests concentrating on a tektite called Moldavite found primarily in the Moldavia region of Eastern Europe. Millions of years ago a meteor or comet impacted that area causing existing silica or sand to melt and hurtle through the air resulting in greenish glassy stones. Moldavite as a rare tektite has been valued by the Occulture as having transformative powers. Believers in its energy experience changes they say occur through the agency if Moldavite. I reference the book Moldavite: Starborn Stone of Transformation by Simmons and Parker (1989) with an endorsement and intro by Jean Houston, Director of the Foundation for Mind Research. I heard Houston, now in her early 80s, lecture about LSD effects on mind research she had done in early 1960s at my University of Dayton around 1967 where I was an undergraduate. Houston gained unwanted fame in 1993 as Hillary Clinton\u2019s spiritual therapist who had Clinton channel Eleanor Roosevelt and Gandhi to help Hillary write a book. Although this was actually an exercise in inspired meditation, the press had fun calling it a \u201Cseance.\u201D  In any case, Houston is firmly in the alternative spirituality realm of the Human Potential Movement. I reference a 2020 YouTube talk about the transformative power of Moldavite by Hibiscus Moon, a woman who got 33,333 views on her discourse that reminded me that the New Age Movement if the 1960s is yet alive and thriving!  Hibiscus said that Moldavite helps with ascension work and other spiritual quests, (she sold it from her store), but in the past two years due to a cosmic shift the green tektite\u2019s powers have diminished due to a cosmic shift. \n\nI mention in 1989 I purchased a tiny Moldavite at a Santa Fe NM New Age bookstore and rock shop as a sample for lectures. While in the shop, I observed two guys trying on expensive Moldavite jewelry and expressing euphoric feelings from contact with it. I felt nothing more than curiosity. My days of naive suggestibility to the symbolic jargon attending rocks and overvaluing the energy were over. \nThe authors Simmons and Parker first encounter stories about the Holy Grail as Moldavite from reading talks by Nicholas and Helena Roerich who founded the Agni Yoga sect I once followed in the late 1970s.",

Melton arranged for Stanley Krippner, a parapsychologist with his team to test JZ to rule out fraud and pathology, which Melton claims they did. I argue that they did not because there was no serious peer review and no similar studies with professionals character actors to compare. To me, Ramtha is nothing more than JZ Knight performing the character.",

Hall\u0027s esoteric history \u0022Secret Teachings of all Ages\u0022 gave me the impressive intellectual force (pseudo-intellectual as it turned out) to believe that Comte de St. Germain (18th Century occultist) was the real deal \u0022Master\u0022 revered by many Freemasons, Theosophists, and modern occultists to this day. Hall argued confidently that St. Germain was Francis Bacon who authored the Shakespeare plays [proven false]. I discuss my involvement with Summit Lighthouse (aka Church Universal and Triumphant) as an offshoot of the I AM cult. I discuss and recommend Foucault\u0027s Pendulum by Umberto Eco (1988) that features St Germain as a main character.  I borrowed \u0022Occulture\u0022 from Christopher Partridge, a scholar who has written and lectured extensively on the topic and calls occulture \u0022normal\u0022 throughout human history--in other words, most people are believers and actors in a phase of occulture even if they only read a daily horoscope in the paper, believe in the deep state behind government, or pray that God or an angel help an ailing mother. I mention books that expose the historic St Germain as a charlatan including Myth of the Magus by E M Butler (!948) and Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds by Charles Mackay (1852, 2nd ed.)",
