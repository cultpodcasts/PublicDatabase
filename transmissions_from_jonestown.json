This footage was saved by a former member as the assets of Peoples Temple were being collected and auctioned off.  This footage was likely shot in 1977-1978.",

      "description": "The Jonestown Massacre, one of the darkest chapters in modern history, occurred on November 18, 1978, in a remote jungle settlement in Guyana. Over 900 members of the Peoples Temple, led by charismatic yet manipulative preacher Jim Jones, died in what Jones called a \u0022revolutionary suicide.\u0022 Men, women, and children consumed cyanide-laced drinks or were forcibly poisoned. The tragedy unfolded after Congressman Leo Ryan visited Jonestown to investigate claims of abuse, only to be ambushed and killed at a nearby airstrip by Temple gunmen. \n\nIn the aftermath of the Jonestown massacre, families gathered at the Human Freedom Center in Berkeley, clinging to hope and bracing for devastating news. Teresa Cobb speaks about her brother, Jim Cobb, who had journeyed to Jonestown with Congressman Leo Ryan as part of the Concerned Relatives group. Wanda Johnson Kice reflects on the early days of Peoples Temple while anxiously awaiting word on her son, Tom Kice Jr., uncertain of his fate. Unbeknownst to her, her ex-husband, Tom Kice Sr., was one of the gunmen who ambushed the Congressman.\n\nWanda and Jim Cobb Sr. are overwhelmed by fear and sorrow, grappling with the agonizing uncertainty of their children\u0027s fate. A moment of relief emerges when they learn that Jim Cobb survived the airstrip attack by hiding in a tree. Wanda\u0027s adult son Wayne Pietila was part of the Concerned Relatives group but he did not go to Jonestown, he stayed behind in Georgetown. Wanda\u0027s  younger son Tom Kice JR and his father both died in Jonestown. \n\nThe Cobb family endured unspeakable loss that day. Among those who perished were Ava Cobb and her husband John Moss Brown, along with their baby Marchelle; Darlene Ramey and her baby Mayshawn; Sandy Cobb and her baby Monyelle; Brenda Cobb; Joel Cobb; and their mother, Christine Cobb. This video offers a somber look at the heartbreaking aftermath, the families left behind, and the enduring pain of those who lost so much in Jonestown.\n\nIn the months following the Jonestown massacre, the sorrow was compounded by a tragic reality\u2014no cemetery was willing to inter the bodies. For months, the remains of hundreds, many unclaimed and unidentified, awaited a resting place as the world recoiled from the horror of the event. Finally, Evergreen Cemetery in Oakland, California, became the first to open its gates, offering a solemn refuge for the victims. At the cemetery\u2019s first memorial service, Fred Lewis, Jynonna Norwood, and Guy Young stood in quiet remembrance, mourning lives lost too soon and the painful legacy left behind. The journey to find a place of peace for the deceased mirrored the tragedy itself\u2014a devastating tale of rejection, loss, and the search for humanity in the aftermath of unimaginable despair.\n\nThis video is intended for educational purposes and seeks to honor and memorialize the victims of the Jonestown tragedy.",

The voices of the choir lifted the spirits of the congregants, electrifying the audience. In 1973 the temple recorded the gospel funk album \u201CHe\u2019s Able\u201D. The altruistic message of equality expressed on the album, the optimism and high energy of the singers juxtaposes what we know will be their eventual fate in Jonestown. Yet in that moment in 1973 now etched on vinyl, the temples future is not yet set, and the dreamers still believe, and you can hear it. \u00A0This is the story behind the making of \u201CHe\u2019s Able\u201D.",

But what did Jim Jones believe? Jim Jones, the pied piper of lies, will forever be remembered as the self-proclaimed prophet who led his flock to the slaughter. Traditional Churches immediately distanced themselves from the Peoples Temple Christian church after the tragedy in Jonestown claiming that Jim Jones only used religion to introduce people to socialism. To assume that whatever the temple believed cannot be found in the Bible might seem reasonable, even comforting. Surely the foundation of a communist suicide cult could only grow outside of traditional religions and on foreign soil. But this assumption is wrong. Join us as we examine Jim Jones beliefs and his adventures with the Holy Ghost.",
