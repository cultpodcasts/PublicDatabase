As a social-psychologist, she studied \u201Cbehavior that broke the rules,\u201D and whether the worst parts of a person\u2019s behavior were innate, nurtured, or misunderstood. So when news broke in 1983 about a \u201Cnew\u201D form of child abuse that she had never heard of before, she was \u2014 as a researcher \u2014 intrigued, and \u2014 as a person \u2014 horrified. But as she began to investigate the cases, the details didn\u2019t add up.",

      "description": "In 1988, a young arts educator drove into a small town in Kentucky with a camera and a directive to teach photography to school kids. But she never got a chance. Instead, a full blown hysteria connecting her presence with other dark rumours swirling around about widespread ritual child sacrifice prompted a mad dash escape for her life. The truth behind the drama? Well, it involves Patrick Swayze and an environment where cops, social workers, teachers, parents and reporters were being primed to see Satanic crime everywhere.",
