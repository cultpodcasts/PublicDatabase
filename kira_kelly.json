      "description": "Hello everyone, in today\u0027s video, two of my friends and I discuss our experience with the Shincheonji cult\u0027s deception. Though it appeared to be a Bible study, there was actually more going on behind the scenes. The group behind this \u0022Bible study\u0022 would not be revealed to us until 10 months in the course. We would still be in this cult being brainwashed if it weren\u0027t for the Holy Spirit providing us wisdom and answering our prayers to questions we had. Satan is working hard, and I don\u0027t want anyone to endure this. Everything we were reading was taken directly from the Bible, but they were misusing it to make us share their worldview.Thank God we had a personal relationship with God and knew him personally. If not, we would have been taken in by the trap.",
