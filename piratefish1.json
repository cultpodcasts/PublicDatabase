      "description": "In this follow-up to their August 16, 2012 report (link below) NBC Rock Center takes another look at Narconon and its connection with the Church of Scientology.\n\nHarry Smith speaks with two ex-Scientologists and former Narconon executives Lucas Catton (Narconon Arrowhead, Oklahoma) and Eric Tenorio (Narconon Freedom Center, Michigan), who are both ashamed of their involvement with Narconon and Scientology. Both men give more damning testimony that exposes the organizations for the \u0022fraud\u0022 that they are, and in their words they describe Narconon\u0027s methods of treatment as \u0022pseudo-science\u0022, and Scientology as a \u0022cult\u0022 that trains its people to \u0022listen for the money\u0022.\n\nIf you have someone close to you who is in need of addiction therapy and you are concerned about finding qualified professional assistance please contact your local hospital or mental health facility for assistance in seeking out properly qualified, addiction therapy counselors and/or facilities near you.\n\n- Part 1; Scientology: The Narconon Lie\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thg31Lp4yB4\n\n- Read the full NBC.com article\nhttp://rockcenter.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/04/04/17600743-scientology-linked-rehab-narconon-under-fire-from-two-former-executives?lite\n\n.",
