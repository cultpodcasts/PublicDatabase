In this chilling conclusion to our two-part deep dive into Sheryl Ruthven\u2019s dark world, we follow her as she launches the notorious cat cult\u2014a bizarre and twisted extension of her control. Ruthven forced her followers to take in up to 30 cats each, demanding they prioritize these animals over their own families. With mounting financial demands and increasingly strange rituals, her grip tightened, driving her followers deeper into her warped and evolving religion. Join us as we uncover the full extent of Ruthven\u2019smanipulation and the devastating fallout that followed. Got a beer you want Doug toreview?

      "description": "NOTE: This episode was recorded prior to April 25, when Todd died. The previous episode was recorded after, because I wanted to address his death on the next episode that I released. Kevin from History Goon once agains joins Bill on this one, and as of the time of release, Kevin\u2019s podcast, History Goon has been released! Show link is with the links below.\n\nIn this episode of Crimes, Killers, Cults and Beer, we take a deep breath and dive into one of the most disturbing and controlling religious movements in modern America \u2014 the Word of Faith Fellowship, led by the iron-fisted Jane Whaley. From her pulpit in Spindale, North Carolina, Whaley built a cult cloaked in Christianity, where members endured public beatings, emotional manipulation, and \u201Cblasting\u201D prayers that sounded more like exorcisms than sermons.\n\nWe break down Jane\u2019s rise from math teacher to spiritual dictator, the shocking allegations of abuse and isolation, and the hold she maintained over followers for decades \u2014 even banning laughter, music, and contact with the outside world. It\u2019s a tale of spiritual control, psychological domination, and the terrifying power of blind faith.\nGrab a beer \u2014 you\u2019re gonna need it \u2014 and join us as we pull back the curtain on the Word of Faith Fellowship cult, where salvation came with a side of fear.\n\nHistory Goon Podcast https://open.spotify.com/show/5rFF8rzQPpRxvp3AQSobVe?si=ae033047e806492d\n\nGot a beer you want Doug to review?

Preacher wasn\u2019t just a gangster \u2014 he was the head of a ruthless criminal enterprise that ran Harlem like a sermon soaked in blood.\nFrom kidnapping and extortion to drug dealing and murder, Heatley\u2019s Preacher Crew turned fear into currency and loyalty into a death sentence. We\u2019re talking about a guy who turned a hotel into his personal torture chamber and handed down his own brand of justice like it was gospel. You\u2019ll hear how he rose to power, what brought him down, and why his story still sends a chill down New York\u2019s spine.\nWe also have sad news, regarding Todd, the first CKCB co-host, and we\u2019re joined once again by History Goon, Kevin Carleton...And, he has an announcement! \n\nBill\u2019s Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/ckcbill\nHistory Goon https://www.facebook.com/groups/historygoon\nThe Forget The Date episode with Kevin and Todd https://open.spotify.com/episode/3tfUyEIVgw8gCAAJnkCjbR\nSend us an email?, send it to ckcbpodcast@gmail.com\nhttps://www.instagram.com/crimeskillerscultsandbeer/\nhttps://twitter.com/CKC_Beer\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUyuqDB2Dlszhpc_pGca29w https://www.facebook.com/groups/257328477392782/",

As a kid, he was abused by a babysitter, which resulted in him becoming s-xually super charged for the rest of his life. \nHe got into ministry as well, and was heavily influenced by William Branham early on. He set up a hippie type church, that combined hippie culture with the Branham message. But as time went on, he became focused on s-x, which would later include relations with everyone, even children. \nHe wound up fleeing the US, and would fund his cult by forcing the women to go out and seduce men for money, a practice that he called flirty fishing. \nHe would do no time, and died in Portugal. The cult is still active today under the name The Family International. There\u0027s alot more to the story, so join us!\n\n\nGot a beer you want Doug to review?

An acting class, led by a Hollywood reject, who later turned his organization into a cult.

She was horrible. I recommend you go back and listen to that episode before listening to this one, if you haven\u2019t yet. \nBut the story didn\u2019t end when Ep 104 did. It went on for another 20 years, and I\u2019m joined tonight by Desti, who was born into this cult to the Haywards, who talked about (Not very nicely) in Ep 104. She is Nate\u2019s little sister.\nShe bravely tells her story about growing up in the cult in its second chapter, and in many ways, the second chapter was worse than the first. BUT, this story has the most satisfying end of any cult story I\u2019ve ever heard. \nDesti is amazing, and I admire her. So, once again, buckle up for an insane story, but at least this one has a happy ending.\n\nPart 1: https://www.ckcbpodcast.com/104-insane-canadian-cult-his-rest-christian-fellowship/\n\n\nhttps://www.ckcbpodcast.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/crimeskillerscultsandbeer/\nhttps://twitter.com/CKC_Beer\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUyuqDB2Dlszhpc_pGca29w\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/257328477392782/",

      "description": "Tonight, we\u2019re doing a cult! A lesser known cult that had its roots in the US, Canada, and elsewhere. A cult that had its own troubled teen industry camps set up to reprogram people...mostly kids who didn\u2019t tow the line of the doctrine. Sam Fife, and The Movement of God cult started in the early 1970s. It hit its peak in the late 70s, and ran strong into the 2000s, where it mostly fizzled out. This was a nasty one. It preached a sinless perfection doctrine, where in order to be a chosen one, you had to be completely without sin. But the cult leaders and elders were the ones who got to define what sin was. Child abuse was the norm, and pedophilia was blamed on the young female victim. They also taught faith healing. None of the leaders ever were brought up on criminal charges, but the survivors of this cult have ALOT to say. So, join us in this episode. Its a good one.

      "description": "Hey, everybody...This week\u2019s episode was an absolutely horrific story. Canadians do their cults crazy. The first one that comes to mind is the Anthill Kids. This cult isn\u2019t that bad, but it is in the Gertrude Baniszewski and Mother Anna\u2019s House of Prayer level of depravity. Its called His Rest Christian Fellowship, and there is literally nothing online about it that I could find other than a 2 minute news story from when they were arrested. I found the book when I was looking for a Canadian cult to cover. \nThis story of course has a crazy woman who thinks she\u2019s God\u2019s prophet, and there is lots of abuse at her hands, plus insane interpretations of the bible. There are also vulgar displays of judicial malpractice, although the police did a great job getting these people to the courtroom. It also has 2 incredibly brave kids. So, give it a listen, and tell someone about it. \nAnd this is a case of be careful what you wish for, because it was absolutely horrible. Paul and I were pissed off pretty much the entire episode. But this case needs to be better known. We are the first podcast to cover it, and I want other podcasts to cover it too. Also, I\u2019m including the link to the book because there\u2019s a lot that I left out. \n\nhttps://www.ckcbpodcast.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/crimeskillerscultsandbeer/\nhttps://twitter.com/CKC_Beer\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUyuqDB2Dlszhpc_pGca29w\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/257328477392782/\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/1777730007?psc=1\u0026ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details\u0026fbclid=IwAR0Q82P-Bchu0RuVzgzYb0XskVgQlPwFJAe-FSb9D-zDGuryaXo82dhqVPY_aem_AUr-wvsGwO37Ro3WwlBQW9vp7PXTM0GxE5t0iK554ptchbq5gmmvQ--fZOu6y1D9xgCQjXkQhQR3nEZGmo2JcOxo",

      "description": "Welcome to Episode 100! We made it! And, to celebrate, we\u2019re covering a hippie trippy drug cult. The Source Family. A cult that began when hustler/con artist, James Baker opened a health food store in California, in the 60\u2019s. With his money and fame from that, he discovered the grooviness of drugs, and began considering himself to be a guru. He ran those stores into the ground, and opened The Source, which was a health food restaurant. The stars of the time loved his health food restaurant. It was the place to be for A list Hollywood elites. He taught the teachings of the Age of Aquarius, and whatever else he dreamed up.\n\n\n\nHe would later change his name to Father Yod, and amassed a following of over 200 people, crammed into small houses. And as time went on, he got crazier and crazier, forcing orgies on his entire clan. His own version of faith healing was the gospel as well. It became a psychedelic boot camp of sorts. He also decided he deserved multiple wives, because he was God. \n\n\n\nIf there was any kind of legacy left behind, it was the music. He had a psychedelic traveling band, that made multiple albums, which are the Holy Grail to music collectors today. \n\n\n\nRun out of California due to allegations of underage liberties, he fled to Hawaii, where his life ended in one of the more creative ways for a cult leader to die.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s get Trippy Culty!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook CKCB Discussion Pub (https://www.facebook.com/groups/257328477392782/) \n\n\n\nFacebook Page (about:invalid#zCSafez)  Instagram (about:invalid#zCSafez)  Twitter(X) (about:invalid#zCSafez)   YouTube  (about:invalid#zCSafez)  Website (about:invalid#zCSafez)",

An off shoot from the Mormon church that occurred when the Mormons banned multiple wives. Warren\u0027s father, Rulon Jeffs became the prophet, and Warren was the heir apparent. Rulon made him the principal of a FLDS school, where Warren began crafting his warped view of Mormonism, and indoctrinating the students. When Rulon died, Warren assumed the role of prophet, and not only amped up the multiple wives, he also brought in child brides, and began trafficking young girls to creepy bootlicker men in the cult. He also instituted a set of the most draconian laws imaginable. Women were nothing more than breeding stock.   Join us as we destroy this creep. Its a very rough story, but we get through it by brutally mocking Warren. Part 2 comes next Saturday.  Twitter Facebook Instagram Website ",

They believed among other things that God would heal anything wrong with you, and going to doctors was a sin.\u00A0 The church had a very high body count of people dying of preventable ailments. And, if you died, it was because your faith wasn\u0027t strong enough, and you had unconfessed sin. They also believed that only the people in their church were going to heaven. Pair that up with isolating the congregation from their friends and families, and you\u0027re in for a world of shit. It had satellite branches all through the US and in several other countries. But, the kicker? It is still active. Buckle up. You\u0027re in for a hell of a ride!Part one is the story of Hobart Freeman and Faith Assembly.

Sergio was VERY good at developing female pop acts in Mexico. He had several platinum artists under his belt, and he was very well respected. Everything he touched turned to gold platinum. He was a gifted musician, and producer, and he had a knack for finding every client\u2019s individual strong spot, and he would bring this out in them. His record speaks for itself. But, if that\u2019s all he did, he wouldn\u2019t be featured on CKCB. He had a taste for underage girls, and married one of his acts. He was also an abusive tyrant prick. But once he discovered Gloria Trevi, and she became Mexico\u2019s top selling pop act of all time, he used his resume to entice many more young girls into his clutches, under the promise that he would \u201Cmake them a star!\u201D Before too long, he had a harem of girls that he was physically and sexually abusing, and he became the target of an international manhunt. One of his \u2018clients\u2019 who got the hell away from him was instrumental in bringing him down. Her courage is very admirable. Join us as we tell this riveting and unbelievable story.",

      "description": "This is a bizarre case. It takes place mainly in the Czech Republic, in 2007, but it bounces around in a weird game of cat and mouse. It was the biggest story in that part of the world for a very long time, as new wrinkles came to light. It has child abuse, obscure cults, cannibalism, and a girl who was sex trafficked, rescued, then vanished. But, things aren\u0027t always what they seem. Or, are they? This story begins when a video baby monitor being used by new parents picked up a stray signal from a similar device nearby. It showed a small naked boy, lying bound on the bare floor of a dark room with no windows. The new father called police, and the events that happened next over a few months are the most peculiar things you\u0027ve ever heard, with one of the craziest endings of any true crime story.\u00A0 Join us as we take you on this roller coaster ride of a case.

In this episode, we discuss his cross country run from the FBI, and his hypocritical activities that he indulged in along the way. His reasoning? He was learning about the evil world so he could better protect his followers. We also cover his arrest and trials, as well as his hilarious desperate attempt to maintain control of the cult while behind bars.  Follow us on social media, and say hi!

      "description": "Another guest on the show, and another cult! We\u0027re covering Heaven\u0027s Gate, the Crazy Comet Cult. We discuss Marshall Applewhite and Bonnie Nettle\u0027s background, and how they took this from a crazy idea to a legit cult that had close to 50 people when it ended. It ended of course, when the majority of the cult all committed suicide to advance to \u0022The Next Level\u0022 which was a planet where they would live for eternity in an existence devoid of personality, feelings, and sex. These people bought in 100% to the teachings, believing that Applewhite and Nettles were the second coming of Jesus Christ, who had the tickets to leave Earth and go away in a spaceship to a better eternity, and that the only way to get there was to off yourself. Castrations not withstanding.  We\u0027re joined by Dr Paul Meckes of the Conscious Radio Network, and their podcast, The Weekly S\u00E9ance, on YouTube, Spotify, and all other platforms. He was awesome, and I\u0027m sure he will be back soon.  Follow us on Facebook Twitter   ",

      "description": "Sorry about the confusion. We uploaded the unedited file accidentally! Its fixed now! We have a special one for you tonight. 16 year old Nora Ashleigh was taken from her bedroom at 3AM and taken into the wastelands of Utah, where she was abused and subjected to all types of cruelty, and even torture. She endured this for 2 years until she finally escaped, and never looked back. But this wasn\u0027t a kidnapping or human trafficking incident. This was done at the request of her own parents. The people who took her were part of a goon squad, that worked for the Troubled Teen Industry. Isolation camps used to reeducate teens with issues. Issues in most cases that were the result of bad or lazy parenting. And, this is all 100% legal, and in many cases backed by the government. Many politicians and celebrities have dumped their teenage children off on these legalized gulags.  This is a multi million dollar industry, that still exists right now, and it isn\u0027t going away any time soon. Now 36 years old, Nora has taken the fight to them, and has become an activist against these organizations, whose practices would be shut down if it was a cult, or a far right militia camp or religious fundamentalist group.  Hundreds of deaths are on the hands of these groups, yet the victims get swept away, and not one of them has been held accountable. Part one is Nora\u0027s personal experience at the hands of these sadists. Part two is her escape, and all she and other survivors are doing to raise awareness.  Click here for Nora\u0027s website She is launching a podcast, which we\u0027ll have the link for in part 2.  Facebook Twitter(X) Instagram Patreon Discord Website",

      "description": "Lou Castro (Real name, Daniel Perez) was a con man, and he was really good at it. Before too long into adulthood, he began concocting an unbelievable story that would rope in the unsuspecting and people who were at the end of their rope.\n\n\n\nHe began telling people that he was an angel, and that he was 1000 years old...Or several thousand years old...Or, that he had powers to see into the future and prophecy when people would die. He could also raise the dead. He could also bring people back from the dead. He himself had come back to life. Whatever he needed the story to be was what it was, and his small group of cultists believed every word of it. \n\n\n\nBut, he needed money, and lots of it. So, he talked his members into taking out huge life insurance policies on themselves, and then they would die, and Lou got all the money. \n\n\n\nHe had a compound in Kansas, nice cars, and he and everyone else were living large. \n\n\n\nHe also convinced them that he had to have sex with as many young girls as possible, so he could continue to be immortal. \n\n\n\nThis guy was a total douchebag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/crimeskillerscultsandbeer/)  Twitter(X) (https://twitter.com/CKC_Beer)   Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/CKCBPC)   Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/CrimesKillersCultsandBeer)   Website (https://www.ckcbpodcast.com/)",

We cover the police work that led to the fall of Angels Landing, with the help of 2 of his victims, and a remarkable man who came into the life of one of them.\n\n\n\nWe conclude with his insane trial, and his idiotic attempts to make the judge and jury believe that he was in fact an angel....with very selective memory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram  (https://www.instagram.com/crimeskillerscultsandbeer/)  Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/CKCBPC)  Twitter(X) (https://twitter.com/CKC_Beer)  Patreon  (https://www.patreon.com/CrimesKillersCultsandBeer)  Website (https://www.ckcbpodcast.com/)",
