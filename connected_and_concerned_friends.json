      "title": "Conversation with Dr Janja Lalich, cult researcher ",
      "description": "I was made aware of the work of Dr Janja Lalich through the \u0022Soul Bruises\u0022 poscast produced by a friend of mine, Christie Hodson.  Dr Lalich has been studying cults for over 40 years.  While the use of the term \u0022cult\u0022 to refer to the 2x2 church is controversial it feels like a conversation that needs to take place.  I recently had to opportunity to have a conversation with Dr Laliach.  We started talking about the struggle a number of us have to reconcile the harm done within the 2x2 church, to ourselves and others, and the positive aspects of it.  We then transition into other areas.  The last two years I have become increasingly aware of the great harm done to many (if not all) of us connected to the church.  This conversation is a direct look at some of that harm and may be quite hurtful to some who still find meaning and value in the church.\n\nMark Simmons\n\n[While this video is posted on the CCF site the views expressed are solely those of Dr Lalich and myself.
