      "description": "Steve VanDermyden and Bill Schueler joined me for a conversation about their experiences in purity culture in the 2x2 church and the work they are doing after leaving.  They share openly and vulnerably about the impact of their upbringing on their emotional health and how they show up in relationships.  Steve also brings insights from his professional work as a relationship coach.  We talk about the lack of healthy emotional and relational role models, how to navigate conflict, communication in realtionships, sex positivity and the challenge of maintaining individuality in relationships where we were taught to be codependent.  \n\nNotes and Resources : https://docs.google.com/document/d/105Q5aUOsU6-DT8IO9Cvyka5xtq8sCFP6sBMztCmmjKo/edit?usp=sharing",

      "description": "I sat down with Julia Postema and Jeremiah Gibson, both certified sex and relationship therapists, that themselves grew up in high-control religion and purity culture.   Even if you haven\u2019t listened to any purity culture episodes so far, I think this conversation will be incredibly helpful.  We talk broadly about how high-control religion affects our skills for being in healthy relationship.  Julia and Jeremiah pull from their own experiences as well as their work with clients and give helpful tools to begin the hard conversations with anyone you may be in relationship with, especially when there are significant differences to be worked through.\n\nWe talk through these questions and many others: What is a healthy relationship?  How do we have a healthy relationship?   How do we start talking about sexuality?  What relationship skills do we miss developing in purity culture?  How do we navigate disagreement?  How do we navigate relationships where each partner is not in the same place in deconstruction?  How is the work for men and women different coming out of purity culture and high control religion?\n\nLink to notes and resources: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M7h7Z2QQm6WMwdzGA9XZGMqtTHC2ztEfwkwzcxi9uj8/edit?usp=sharing",

      "description": "Mike Prussack and Mark Simmons joined me for a conversation about their experiences as men growing up in purity culture in the 2x2 church.  Purity Culture seems to have laid the biggest burden on women, but it is not without its effects on men.  I think it\u2019s important to have conversations about how it affected men both to help open conversations around shame and healing but also for those of us in relationship with men to better understand them and start growing healthy relationships together. I\u2019m grateful to Mike and Mark for their courage and vulnerability in sharing their own experiences.  These are not easy topics to navigate.  We do talk about porn, masturbation, and pre-marital sex among other sensitive topics.  Not as experts with any answers, but de-stigmatizing conversations on these topics and the shame that can come with them.  As always, choose to listen or not, pause or come back later if needed.  Listen to yourself and your body and what is right for you.",

Kim shares a bit of her own story and experience in high-control religion and purity culture and helps us to re-frame how we see our relationship with our bodies, our emotions, and our authentic selves. She brings an Eastern lens to her work which provides a holistic view of human development and sees our emotions and bodies as important parts of our selves, not separate from our spirituality.  I love that Kim shared so many small, practical things we can do to help ourselves reconnect. She shared several resources and a short embodiment practice at the end of the video.  I appreciated her gentle teaching and I hope you will too.\n\nLink to many resources on healing, how to find Kim, and additional notes: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nD7S2_tfCNS3coxQjFA1w30S11PhOef6zyP_tL_A2so/edit?usp=sharing",

      "description": "I was made aware of the work of Dr Janja Lalich through the \u0022Soul Bruises\u0022 poscast produced by a friend of mine, Christie Hodson.  Dr Lalich has been studying cults for over 40 years.  While the use of the term \u0022cult\u0022 to refer to the 2x2 church is controversial it feels like a conversation that needs to take place.  I recently had to opportunity to have a conversation with Dr Laliach.  We started talking about the struggle a number of us have to reconcile the harm done within the 2x2 church, to ourselves and others, and the positive aspects of it.  We then transition into other areas.  The last two years I have become increasingly aware of the great harm done to many (if not all) of us connected to the church.  This conversation is a direct look at some of that harm and may be quite hurtful to some who still find meaning and value in the church.\n\nMark Simmons\n\n[While this video is posted on the CCF site the views expressed are solely those of Dr Lalich and myself.

I am humbled by the courage shown by Linda, not only in sharing her story with us now, but by the fact of her continuing to move through a remarkable life the past many years as she carried this incomprehensible burden.\u201D\n\n\u201CLinda has her reasons for sharing this at this point and those are made clear in the watching. I hope that a takeaway for some of you might be the permission to find your own meaning from your experience, as she has.\u201D\n\nWe\u2019re grateful to Linda for allowing her story to be shared, and to Mark for creating the space to listen.",

While these teachings are widespread across Christianity, the 2x2 version adds its own unique layers\u2014reinforced by rules, silence, and systems of power.\n\nWe explore how purity is tied to control: from rules around sex, modesty, and celibacy to public shaming, rigid gender roles, and strict lifestyle expectations. These messages don\u2019t just shape belief\u2014they impact bodies, relationships, and identity.\n\nThis conversation is grounded in lived experience, months of research, and insights from Dr. Tina Schermer Sellers.\n\nTrigger warning: Discussion of sexual abuse, rape, and purity-based shame (non-graphic).\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1RLbhO9c99HTlEkLfrcJ2xxElw7HMYMeILR3GnpA_NpY/edit?usp=sharing",
