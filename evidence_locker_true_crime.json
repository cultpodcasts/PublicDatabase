      "description": "In celebration of Halloween, this week\u2019s episode is a re-release of one of our first episodes - still chilling... Adolfo Constanzo, also known as El Padrino (or the Godfather), was the leader of a cult that believed that Black Magic would shield their drug cartel from being busted. Adolfo encouraged human sacrifice, and countless people fell victim to the cult, later dubbed the Narcosatanists. When American medical student Mark Kilroy disappeared after a night out in Matamoros, the cult\u2019s sadistic activities finally came to light.
