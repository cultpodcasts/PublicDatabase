      "description": "The Apocalypse of John, commonly called the Book of Revelation, was indeed a revelation to 2 former Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, feeling their way cautiously toward true Christian faith after a traumatic departure from the cult which held them mentally captive for decades, the Watchtower. Most of the Revelation\u0027s most important lessons, it must be admitted, are right there on the surface of the book -- even in JW.org\u0027s own Bible, the New World Translation. But what is NOT there may have to be pointed out, so habituated are Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses to the \u0022cherry-picking\u0022 method of Bible use, which indeed is not Bible study at all, but proof-texting. That is, using Scripture not as the Word of God to an specific time, place and situation, but as a grab bag of references to \u0027prove\u0022 what you believe already.",

Not only, in their view, is he breaking the Sabbath by healing a man, but He is making a unique claim about His relationship with God. Were these critics right in their understanding of Jesus\u0027 claims? In His language about God and Himself, which follows the accusations (John 5:16-29), Jesus\u0027 unprecedented use of the terms \u0022the Father\u0022 and \u0022the Son\u0022 does not discourage His critics. Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses (JW.org/Watchtower) deny that Christ claimed to be equal with God. They also claim that He proclaimed the Tetragrammaton in public, in defiance of Jewish convention. Does Christ\u0027s consistent reference to \u0022the Father\u0022 and \u0022the Son\u0022 support either contention of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses?",

What do REAL experts say about the notion that the church has changed beyond recognition, especially in its doctrinal beliefs? One of the greatest of all New Testament scholars, Charles Kingsley Barrett (1917-2011), addresses this question at the end of his little book \u0022Church, Ministry, \u0026 Sacraments in the New Testament\u0022 (1985). Barrett concludes that while the church DID change in a significant direction at the end of the apostolic age, the change was not any drastic alterations of doctrine, though there were refinements indeed in that area. The major change, rather, was in church forms, specifically in the increased emphasis on sacraments and the external ritual of Christianity. Along with that change, an increased emphasis on human authority within the churches, resulting in a neglecting of Paul\u0027s great teaching about the role of ALL members of the \u0022body\u0022 in the creation of stability, maturity and unity in the whole church of Jesus Christ.",

Ray Franz lays the responsibility for the cold, inhuman treatment of \u0022apostates\u0022 at the feet of the Watchtower\u0027s idolatrous, blasphemous concept -- that God needs an \u0022Organization\u0022 to perform His work in the world.",

      "description": "Luke 18:9-14 -- the Pharisee \u0026 the tax collector go up to the Temple -- was a major factor in our deciding where Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses stood in the eyes of Christ. Who goes home justified -- declared righteous by God? The \u0027good religious Jew\u0027, or the apostate, the traitor to Judaism and his race? The shocking truth, from the JW standpoint, is that you cannot justify yourself before God by YOUR religious performance, nor by comparing your fidelity with others\u0027 infidelities. Only the humble penitent, who casts himself down before the throne of God\u0027s mercy, can stand finally in the presence of the Holy God.

Ray knew Peter to be a good man, a faithful friend -- and a follower of God and Christ. How could the Watchtower Society now treat such a man as an apostate, an \u0022antichrist\u0022, a \u0022wicked man\u0022 -- the descriptions which are found in the Society\u0027s favourite prooftexts for their disfellowshipping policies (2 John 7-11; 1 Cor 5:9-13).",

This ORG finally takes on a personality of its own -- an image which is bigger than and outside of human dimension.
