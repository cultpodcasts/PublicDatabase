      "description": "Deborah Frances-White is the woman behind The Guilty Feminist, the podcast that\u2019s sparked global conversations about modern feminism, contradiction, and calling ourselves in. She\u2019s a comedian, an author, a screenwriter, and a performer. But underneath all of that is someone who knows what it means to live in silence. Adopted at birth and raised in a strict religious community, Deborah grew up in a world shaped by rules, obedience, and fear. She was taught to conform. To behave. To stay quiet. And she did, for a while. In this episode of No Filter, Deborah shares the story of walking away from everything she was raised to believe, and how she found her voice in the aftermath. We talk about her new book, Six Conversations We\u2019re Scared to Have, and why she\u0027s choosing to say the things most of us are too afraid to. She speaks about gender non-conformity, shame, free speech, cancel culture, and the emotional impact of being publicly shunned. We also talk about comedy, and how it became the way she processes pain, connection and truth. This is a conversation about identity, courage, and what happens when you stop being the person everyone expected you to be.

In this raw and powerful conversation, Tim opens up about his time at Redfield College in Sydney - a school linked to Opus Dei. He speaks candidly about surviving conversion therapy, and the years he spent battling internalised homophobia. Tim also shares what it was like to grow up silenced, how that trauma shaped his relationship with his body, his family and his faith, and what it took to finally unlearn it all - and live as himself. This is a story of survival, truth, and reclaiming identity.

With hundreds of thousands of followers online, Belle had become a celebrated wellness influencer who\u0027d overcome terminal cancer and had cured herself with healthy eating and holistic therapies. But it was all a lie. The truth came to light when her friend, Chanelle McAuliffe, noticed gaps in Belle\u0027s story. The moment she exposed her deception is now the focus of the Netflix series Apple Cider Vinegar.

The first is the cult-classic TV series, One Tree Hill, where she played the role of Haley for ten years, alongside cast members Sophie Bush and Chad Michael Murray. Yet, what few people knew is that the entire time she was on the iconic show, she was in another kind of cult - the dangerous, isolating, manipulative kind. In this Australian exclusive, she shares her story with Mia Freedman and explains how she found herself in a cult to begin with, what it cost her - literally and figuratively - and what finally helped her find the courage to leave.
