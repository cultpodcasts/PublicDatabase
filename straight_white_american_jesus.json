      "description": "This episode delves into the recent controversies surrounding Opus Dei, a secretive and influential organization within the Catholic Church. According to a report from Infovaticana, Opus Dei faces a significant internal rupture that could see it fragmented into three distinct bodies, effectively dissolving its current structure. Annika Brockschmidt guest hosts in conversation with journalist Gareth Gore, author of \u0027Opus: The Cult of Dark Money, Human Trafficking, and Right-Wing Conspiracy inside the Catholic Church.\u0027 Gareth elaborates on the historical context and modern operations of Opus Dei, including its recruitment and coercive practices. He also highlights the organization\u0027s conflicts with the Vatican and ongoing abuse allegations.
