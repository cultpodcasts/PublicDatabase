      "description": "Please support this show by subscribing to patreon.com/montemader. Please leave a rating and review! Happy Halloween!!! In this episode, I am going to take you deep into one of the most bizarre and destructive moral panics in modern history \u2014 the Satanic Panic. From daycare witch hunts to heavy metal hysteria, the 1980s saw ordinary Americans convinced that the Devil had moved into their suburbs. Police were trained to spot pentagrams and candles as signs of ritual murder, therapists \u201Crecovered\u201D memories of occult abuse, and media outlets like Geraldo Rivera and Oprah fueled the flames. Innocent people were imprisoned, reputations destroyed, and entire communities torn apart \u2014 all in the name of protecting children from imaginary cults. Lets explore how this hysteria culminated in the West Memphis Three case \u2014 three teenagers convicted largely for wearing black and listening to Metallica. Nearly two decades later, DNA evidence revealed what fear had obscured all along: there was no cult, no ritual, and no Satanic conspiracy \u2014 just a community so terrified of darkness that it created its own. But the story doesn\u2019t end there. The same architecture of fear \u2014 hidden elites, child-trafficking conspiracies, and divine warfare \u2014 has found new life online through Pizzagate and QAnon. Monte connects the dots between the witch hunts of the 1980s and the algorithmic hysteria of the digital age, revealing how the Satanic Panic never really died \u2014 it just went viral. Through history, psychology, and media analysis, this episode asks a haunting question: Why do we keep needing a devil to blame? Sources \u0026 References: Pazder, Lawrence \u0026 Michelle Smith.

      "title": "20. Escaping a Cult w/ Dr. Steven Hassan",
      "description": "How can someone so intelligent end up with a cult like mindset? Someone who otherwise seems to have their life together? Seems to be so grounded? Anyone can fall into a cult, and even those who are deeply indoctrinated can get back out. Dr. Steven Hassan is a leading expert in cults, mind control, and undue influence, best known for transforming his own traumatic experience in a high-control group into a lifelong mission to help others recover from coercive persuasion. Born in Queens, New York, Hassan was raised in a Jewish family and, at age 19, was recruited into the Unification Church (commonly known as the \u201CMoonies\u201D). He quickly became a zealous member, working long hours and cutting ties with family and friends. After a serious car accident in 1976, his family organized a deprogramming intervention, which helped him leave the group and sparked his determination to understand how such manipulation occurs. Hassan earned a Master\u2019s in counseling psychology from Cambridge College and later completed a Ph.D. from Fielding Graduate University. Over the following decades, he dedicated himself to developing non-coercive methods of intervention, eventually creating what he calls the Strategic Interactive Approach. He also founded the Freedom of Mind Resource Center, which provides education, counseling, and expert support for individuals and families affected by cults, extremist groups, human trafficking, and political radicalization. Hassan is widely recognized for his development of the BITE Model (Behavior, Information, Thought, and Emotional control), which helps identify the key mechanisms by which authoritarian groups manipulate people. He also created the Influence Continuum, a framework for understanding the difference between healthy and destructive influence. His published works\u2014including Combating Cult Mind Control, Releasing the Bonds, Freedom of Mind, and The Cult of Trump\u2014have become foundational texts for understanding psychological manipulation and authoritarian control, not just in religious cults but in political movements and abusive relationships as well. He has helped thousands reclaim their autonomy and continues to shape the conversation on cult dynamics, political extremism, and mental freedom in the digital age. There\u0027s always hope that even someone who was raised in a cult or lost their way in one can find their way back out.",

      "title": "16. Children of God Sex Cult",
      "description": "In a world of cult like beliefs, propaganda, and manipulation its important to become experts on how these tactics work so that we can avoid them and so that we understand whats happening in the world around us. A little true crime break from the norm but an important discussion we have to continue to return to. HOW DO PEOPLE BELIEVE THIS? By using tactics we see everywhere. The Children of God, founded in 1968 by David Berg, was a sex cult that disguised itself as a Christian missionary movement. Berg, who called himself \u201CMoses David,\u201D claimed divine authority and used it to manipulate and control his followers through apocalyptic teachings and a series of writings known as \u201CMo Letters.\u201D Under his leadership, the group promoted sexual \u201Cfreedom\u201D that included disturbing practices like \u201Cflirty fishing,\u201D where women were encouraged to use sex to recruit new members. Even more sinister, Berg endorsed and participated in the sexual abuse of children, normalizing pedophilia within the group\u2019s teachings. He lived in hiding for much of his life to evade legal consequences, but continued to exert control over the group until his death in 1994. Berg\u2019s legacy is one of extreme psychological, spiritual, and sexual abuse, with many former members coming forward to expose the deep and lasting trauma they endured under his cult leadership.
