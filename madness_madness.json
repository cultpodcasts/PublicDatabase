(We also take a moment to mourn the death of its founder, Charles Paul Brown, who died in 2014 NO YOU SHUT UP!) Are we ready to spend our immortal lives eating the worst food imaginable? Before we decide, we\u0027ll take a look at The Waldorf School, founded by Rudolf Steiner, who dared to ask the question, \u0022What if we did like that Montessori lady but without applying any provable facts at all?\u0022 Steiner hated facts, so thank god he started a school. Speaking of school, this week it\u0027s book fair! Bring your rolls of pennies, as Amanda is not accepting loose coins.\u00A0",

It\u0027s pitted against Access Consciousness, which is a more traditional grift, but one that has a secret star from the wide world of sports! Described as \u0022Scientology Adjacent,\u0022 where \u0022Adjacent\u0022 means \u0022Shitty Clone,\u0022 Access Consciousness has currently shelled out for paid ads in Google search when you look for \u0022access consciousness cult.\u0022 Try it!

I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a reasonable explanation (there isn\u0027t). We\u0027re also partying down in an abandoned secretarial school, in Paris! That\u0027s thanks to Thierry Tilly, a run-of-the-mill creep who bled a family of French aristocrats dry, and if you\u0027re not noting any sadness in this sentence, you\u0027re not imagining things.

The founders of Ganas, which as it happens began as an unaccredited school for group therapy, are entirely with me on this one, and would like to interest you in a completely different, entirely legitimate diploma. But before you accept, two questions: Men, have you ever asked yourself, \u0022Am I denying my sacred manliness by not acting like some horrifying post-pubescent toddler all the fucking time?\u0022 Women, have you ever thought, \u0022I sure wish a gross little Boomer twerp from some shithole suburb outside Boston could tell me a lot of dumb fucking garbage about what I\u0027m doing wrong in my relationship!\u0022 Boy oh boy, is A.

Raelism (not realism) is, at the very least, a cult where you\u0027re less likely to be burned to death for the knights templar than France\u0027s other entry into the series.
