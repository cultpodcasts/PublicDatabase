      "description": "A new method of meditation is being promoted on YouTube by Bhante Vimalaramsi (born Marvel Logan), Delson Armstrong, and David Johnson, who call themselves Suttavadins. Their method is called TWIM (Tranquil Wisdom Insight Meditation) and their home base is Dhamma Sukha Meditation Center. They claim that this practice takes one all the way to full Awakening (Enlightenment). But is this really true? And is it safe? We expose the truth about TWIM.\n\n\uD83C\uDF99\uFE0F\uD83C\uDFA7 For those who wish to listen while on the go or those with sensory processing disorders who find music beds and sound effects interfere with their ability to attend to dialogue, a podcast mix of this presentation is now available on YouTube Music: \n\uD83D\uDC49\uD83C\uDFFD https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=NH7STU-llkg\n\n\uD83E\uDDE1 You can donate to show your appreciation \u0026 support on Ko-Fi:\n\uD83D\uDC49\uD83C\uDFFD https://ko-fi.com/BeingUntangled\n\n\uD83D\uDE4F Thanks to the following:\nVen.Thanissaro Bhikkhu, Ven.
