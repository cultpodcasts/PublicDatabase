      "description": "By popular demand, we are reissuing his unforgettable episode of Braving Business where we meet Crystal Ball, whose life is a testament to resilience, reinvention, and the power of embracing freedom. Raised in poverty and repression within the infamous \u201CShiny Happy People\u201D cult, Crystal\u2019s childhood was defined by control and fear. But breaking free was only the beginning. Crystal shares her journey through profound loss, including surviving Hurricane Michael, losing both grandparents, and helping her husband recover from a stroke\u2014all in one harrowing year. These challenges, combined with the unexpected catalyst of motherhood, pushed her to leave a 13-year corporate career and accidentally embark on a path of entrepreneurship. Now thriving in Panama City Beach, Crystal combines her passion for real estate and the coastal lifestyle as a successful entrepreneur and Sales Director of a boat club. She\u2019s also preparing to release her autobiography, \u201CDiary of a Cult Girl,\u201D in early 2025, a bold and deeply personal account of breaking generational cycles and reclaiming self-worth. In this episode, Crystal reveals: How her upbringing shaped her drive and why hyper-achievement can be a trauma response. The role of radical honesty and forgiveness in rebuilding her life. The hilarious story of how she offered her ex-husband as part of a real estate deal, which made headlines in the New York Post. What \u201Csuccess\u201D looks like now and how it\u2019s changed over the years. The values she\u2019s instilling in her children to break harmful cycles. Crystal\u2019s story is raw, inspiring, and a powerful reminder that healing, freedom, and purpose are within reach\u2014even in the face of unimaginable challenges. Key Takeaways: \u201CLife is a daring adventure or nothing at all.\u201D\u2014Crystal\u2019s favorite quote by Helen Keller encapsulates her journey of resilience and courage. How counseling, partnerships, and boundaries helped her overcome trauma and rebuild. Why she believes honesty and openness are the keys to resilience in life and business.
