      "description": "Parliamentary inquiry gathers further evidence on how high-control groups operate\u2014and the impact they have on the community. \n\nAdditional public hearings have been held, bringing in a wide range of voices, including tertiary sector organisations, the federal charities regulator, and people with lived experience. Their insights are helping build a clearer picture of how these groups operate, who they target, and what protections might be needed moving forward.",
