      "description": "Day 1 of a 30 Day Challenge:\n\nFor years, I carried beliefs, fears, and patterns I didn\u0027t even know were running me. Talk therapy helped \u2014 but it only went so far. That\u0027s when I discovered the truth: 95-97% of our beliefs, emotional patterns, and behaviors are stored in the subconscious mind. And if you want real change? You have to go deeper.\n\nThis is Day 1 of a 30-day experiment where I\u0027m rewiring one of my subconscious fears \u2014 being on camera. \uD83D\uDE2C\n\nI\u0027m not just teaching this. I\u0027m living it. Watch me do the work, stumble through it, and (hopefully) come out the other side transformed.\n\nIf you\u0027ve ever felt stuck in patterns you can\u0027t explain \u2014 this series is for you.\n\n\uD83D\uDD25 Follow the journey:\n\nInstagram: @theriseanywayproject\n\n#exJW #exjwstories #exjehovahswitness #cultsurvivor #igotout   #healingthroughstory #weriseanyway #subconsciousreprogramming #subconsciousmind #rewiring #personaldevelopmentcourse #attachmentstyles #nervoussystem #nervoussystemregulation #rewirethinking #rewireyourbrain",
