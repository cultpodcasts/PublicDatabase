      "description": "ICSA 2025 Conference - Montreal, QC \n-\nOmar Salda\u00F1a, Emma Antelo, Andrea Escudero, \u00C1lvaro Rodr\u00EDguez-Carballeira\n-\nWhat Fuels Extreme Progroup Behavior? The Devoted Actor Model in Group Contexts\n-\nAbstract: From the field of psychology, various theoretical models have been proposed to explain why individuals may engage in extreme behaviors, such as self-sacrifice or violence. The Devoted Actor Model is a recent theoretical framework addressing this phenomenon, particularly in the context of violent radicalization. This model posits that individuals who uphold certain sacred values and experience identity fusion with a group that shares these values\u2014feeling a profound sense of oneness with the group\u2014are willing to make exceptionally costly and extreme sacrifices for their beliefs and/or their group. Building on this premise, the present study examines the perpetration of abusive behaviors toward other group members, a dynamic commonly observed in coercive cults, as another form of extreme behavior. Specifically, the study aims to assess the willingness of members from various types of groups to engage in such abusive behaviors. To this end, a questionnaire was administered to over 300 active members of different groups, including religious, political, cultural, and personal development organizations. We explore the values that give purpose to these groups, whether members consider these values to be sacred, and what actions they would be willing to take to defend them. Furthermore, we analyze individuals\u0027 relationships with their groups, focusing on whether they experience identity fusion and how this relates to their willingness to defend the group, even at the cost of extreme sacrifices. The results of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the psychological mechanisms driving participation in potentially abusive group dynamics. \nThese findings provide valuable insights into the experiences of individuals who become victims of groups that promote such behaviors, thereby fostering a greater comprehension of the risks associated with extreme pro-group behavior.",

      "description": "ICSA 2025 Conference - Montral, QC\n-\nClaire Alison Hams, Zoe Lambert\n-\nAbstract: This co-presented video discussion by Claire Alison Hams (Post Cult Counsellor and PhD researcher, University of Chester) and Dr Zoe Lambert (Creative writing Lecturer, Lancaster University) explores their experiences of designing and running two pilot initiatives, hosted online in 2024 from the UK, to support recovery for ex-members of high control religions, groups and cults.\n\nIn September 2024, Claire designed and ran a 6-session online \u0027Recovery Group\u0027, via Humanists UK for 10 participants. Individual applicants were pre-met for 30 mins to discuss the group rationale and to have opportunity to ask questions. This was specifically described as \u0027not group therapy\u0027 but rather a series of specialist presentations by 5 ex-member therapists, on a range of topics relevant to recovery from high control. These covered the following topics: understanding the unique form of grief experienced by ex-members, the concept of doors to recovery, loss of community \u0026 isolation, understanding boundaries and having a voice, and sexuality and relationships. The aim was to create a closed-group, psychoeducational space held by therapists, which allowed for group connection and discussion. In November 2024 Zoe, supported by Claire, led a \u0027Writing for Wellbeing\u0027 3 session course, via Lancaster University for 10 ex-members from worldwide. Zoe explored with participants the powerful medium of writing into emotion, with a focus on \u0027writing for process not product\u0027, via journaling, poetry and story telling. Participants met with Zoe and Claire for 30 mins online prior to the course starting to provide an opportunity for questions and for them to learn about the background of the ex-member, whilst checking on their support network and reminders about self-care throughout the process.\n\nZoe and Claire candidly discuss both challenges, fears, benefits and joys of running these new pilot support initiatives, whilst sharing some of the anonymised feedback received from participants of both groups.",

      "description": "ICSA 2025 International Conference - Montral, QC\n-\nNicola Brophy\n-\nAbstract: This autoethnographic account examines the experience of engaging with art therapy as a second-generation adult who has left the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The transition away from such faiths often involves significant struggles with trust, fear, somatic reactions, and existential distress, as identified in various fields of research including psychology, sociology, counseling, and cult studies. However, limited research exists on creative therapies within this context. To facilitate a deeper exploration of the experience, the researcher draws upon her own journey, which has been scaffolded by personal therapy, education, and a safe, supportive environment, ensuring that the research remains ethical.\n\nUsing autoethnography, this dissertation delves into the researcher\u2019s engagement with art therapy over a span of 20 months. It incorporates journal entries and documentation of artistic processes in both group and individual settings, highlighting the barriers encountered in therapy and how these can be navigated through using art therapy as a modality. The findings reveal art therapy as a powerful tool for stabilization, emotional processing, and self-expression. Additionally, the research emphasizes the critical importance of the therapeutic environment and the therapist\u0027s understanding of high-demand religions and religious trauma, particularly in the early stages of therapy. The capacity of artmaking to quickly access emotions and memories underscores the necessity for practitioners to have qualifications in creative therapy, along with an awareness of the experiences of individuals who have left highdemand religions.",

      "description": "ICSA 2025 International Conference -- Montral, QC \n-\nKim Peirano\n-\nAbstract: In the age of social media, wellness culture has become a powerful force, shaping how we view health, self-improvement, and community. Beneath its glossy exterior lies a darker, cult-like undercurrent that can lead to isolation, manipulation, and harm. This presentation explores how influencers, ideologies, and isolation converge to create a modern wellness phenomenon with cultic features fueled by digital platforms.\n\nSocial media has amplified wellness culture, transforming it into a digital ecosystem where charismatic influencers position themselves as gatekeepers to exclusive knowledge, offering followers a sense of belonging and selfempowerment\u2014despite their lack of healthcare training, while promoting questionable health practices and products. We will also examine the origins of toxic individualism, tracing back to the Reagan era, where the promotion of personal responsibility and self-reliance was tied to purity and moral superiority. This narrative of \u0022self-made\u0022 success laid the groundwork for wellness culture\u2019s emphasis on personal responsibility for health, which often shifts blame onto individuals for their own struggles, particularly in areas like chronic illness, mental health, and body image. The connection between purity culture and wellness ideologies will be explored, showing how the pressure to \u0022be perfect\u0022 and \u0022fix yourself\u0022 continues to influence how we engage with wellness today.\n\nBy examining how social media algorithms reinforce echo chambers, this talk delves into how wellness communities isolate followers from diverse perspectives, deepening dependency on specific health ideologies and instilling fear of anything that strays from those ideologies. Drawing parallels to traditional cults, we will explore how wellness spaces use manipulation, emotional appeals, and coercive tactics to foster a sense of loyalty, making it difficult for followers to escape.\n\nThe session will conclude with a call for greater media literacy, encouraging individuals to critically assess wellness content online and recognize the potential harms of becoming entangled in digital wellness movements.",

      "description": "ICSA International Conference 2025 - Montreal, QC\n-\nGinger Zyskowski \n-\nAbstract: In the 1970\u2019s, cults were becoming more prevalent across the country. Young people were being recruited for membership and families were desperate to understand the attraction that captivated their children. This desperation led to an action called \u2018deprogramming\u2019 \u2013 a grass roots effort that was unethical and illegal. It consisted of kidnapping the family member and subjecting the person to hours of intense interrogation while trying to explain that he/she was under the influence of mind control. Having been a victim of a Ted Patrick kidnapping and deprogramming, as well as the victim of having my three small children abducted and taken across the country, will allow me to share the difficulties I faced resulting from such an extreme trauma and the lace of resources available to help with cult recovery and gain a better understanding of the complexities that accompany an intervention.\n\nMy cult recovery used the \u2018Humpty-Dumpty\u2019 method as I tried to pick up the pieces of my broken self and put them back together without any instructions. A better understanding of this process would have been appreciated as opposed to having judgements and comparisons thrust upon me. Whether the person is a walk-away, a castaway, or is kidnapped for a deprogramming, more needs to be done to help. I will share my story and my newly released book, \u2018Shattered \u2013 One Woman\u2019s True Story of Trauma, Coercive Control and Survival.\u2019 My recovery continues.",

      "description": "ICSA International Conference 2025 - Montreal, QC\n-\nAled Thomas, Edward Graham-Hyde\n-\nAbstract: The history of minority religions has been marked by (often hostile) interactions between minority religions and \u2018anti-cult\u2019 networks, usually consisting of former members of minority religions and/or concerned friends and relatives. Since the advent of online communication, hierarchical forms of anti-cult organisations (such as the Cult Awareness Network) have faded, giving way to more fluid networks of exmembers and \u2018never-ins\u2019 (anti-cult activists who were \u2018never in\u2019 the groups they are protesting). \nEx-member narratives have often been neglected, or even ignored, within scholarship on minority religions (see Wilson 1990). This paper seeks to remedy this by exploring the emergent forms of anti-cult activism activated in online spaces. It will demonstrate how online anti-cult discourses allows ex-members to navigate their lives following departure from a minority religion, in addition to framing their former experiences. The use of social media and podcasting platforms has allowed ex-members to publicly voice opposition and level accusations against their former movements, whilst allowing them to build an audience of \u2018followers\u2019 to engage with their activism. The paper will also demonstrate how these activisms have often developed beyond digital spaces into in-person protests and campaigns.",

      "description": "ICSA International Conference 2025 - Montreal, QC\n-\nNatalee Bigger Stockdale\n-\nAbstract: Self-alienation can be a debilitating symptom that halts the chance of normal living for victims of coercive control. There is a developing body of knowledge regarding the best practices for therapy, but there is still a gap in research for how to aid survivors of coercive control with clinical Art Therapy. Using Art therapy is an ethical and skillful modality that may be a helpful tool to aid in building self-connection after a person survives a cult. In this session Natalee will explore a theoretical Art Therapy directive. The art directive includes a drawing and coloring method to visually capture a personal somatic experience. An optional written process will be offered to inventory the environmental stimulus and attach language to sensations that result from the environmental stimulus. Through this method of documentation of events and bodily experiences a survivor can potentially utilize art as a recovery tool, selfconnection, and a safety container. Using Art Therapy as a tool can be used to build somatic awareness through providing reflective distance and while introducing opportunities for play. Natalee Bigger Stockdale Building self-connection through creative expression can also be a solution focused goal in therapy. Through the ethical use of Art Therapy with licensed and trained provider, Art Therapists can utilize visualized somatic practices to help clients externalize submerged shame and process in a contained and safe enough way.",

      "description": "ICSA International Conference - Montreal, QC\n-\nLiz Sallows, Dresden Andrea, Magdalene Leon\n-\nAbstract: Purity culture, with its emphasis on sexual abstinence as a measure of moral worth, is a powerful framework that has deeply affected many individuals, particularly within religious, patriarchal, and social communities. Though originally intended to promote sexual restraint, the consequences of these teachings extend well beyond sexuality, shaping individuals\u2019 understanding of their bodies, relationships, and personal autonomy. As Valenti (2009) notes, these messages continue to influence individuals long after leaving the environments where purity culture was central, affecting everything from personal identity to relationship dynamics and self-worth. Purity culture has deeply influenced individuals within many religious and social communities, shaping not only sexual ethics but also personal identity, relationship dynamics, and self-worth (Moslener, 2015). These teachings are woven into many people\u2019s self-concept, creating beliefs and patterns that are hard to unlearn and that can persist into adult life. For many, the effects of purity culture can be seen in how they approach intimacy, set boundaries, and view their own value.\nWith attention to both lived experiences and academic insights, this interdisciplinary panel will bring together speakers who have been directly shaped by purity culture, sharing how it has affected their lives and offering perspectives for those seeking to understand and heal. By exploring these personal narratives alongside research, we aim to foster understanding, inspire reflection, and provide resources for those impacted by purity culture, whether directly or indirectly. Prior to coming to this panel, we invite you to reflect on what purity culture means to you.",

      "description": "ICSA International Conference 2025 - Montreal, QC\n-\nRobin Boyle-Laisure\n-\nAbstract: Human trafficking is a federal and international crime, occurring at alarming rates. In the United States, every 2.5 hours, a child is taken by human traffickers.\nWorldwide, it is estimated that 27 million people are exploited for labor, services, and commercial sex. Also, at least 2,500,000 Americans have joined cultic groups during the past 30-40 years.\nHuman traffickers and cult leaders share similar modus operandi. Cults and traffickers strategically recruit, groom, and coerce their victims for profit. The media portrays human traffickers as strangers snatching children off of the street. While these incidents do occur, it is more common for the victim to know the trafficker. How this relationship develops is the central point of this talk. I will highlight a significant increase in the traffickers\u2019 use of the Internet for the exploitation of children and teenagers. I will also point out the lack of publicity about cult recruitment on college campuses, and the need for colleges to advise their students to be wary of recruitment. In my talk at the ICSA conference in Barcelona last July, I addressed common characteristics between human trafficking and cults. The talk in Montreal will touch upon those similarities, but it will also draw from research for my forthcoming book: \u201CTaken No More: Protecting Your Children Against Traffickers and Cults\u201D (forthcoming Bloomsbury 2025).",

      "description": "Respectful Conversations in an Increasingly Polarized World: What Have We Learned From Working With Current and Former Members of Cults and Victims and Survivors of Domestic Abuse?\n-\nICSA International Conference 2025 - Montreal, QC\n-\nRod Dubrow-Marshall, Linda Dubrow-Marshall, Kate Amber, Jennifer French Tomasic\n-\nAbstract: In a time when there is increased political polarization and conflict, the tendency to see the \u2018opposing side\u2019 as the enemy is almost overwhelming. Yet in the work that is done to help people exit and recover from abusive groups and relationships there is a widely acknowledged need to understand the attraction and nature of the trauma bond between the abuser or cult leader and those who follow them.\nThis approach mirrors the philosophy of ICSA in supporting open dialogue between individuals and groups with different views in the belief that this can bring benefits to all parties. At its heart, exit work or counselling requires a respect to be shown towards the victim or survivor while not ceding ground to the aberrant or harmful beliefs or practices into which they were coerced and indoctrinated (Giambalvo, 2018). In this roundtable panel discussion, four experienced professionals and researchers in the fields of cultic studies and coercive control will share and discuss their work with those that are victims or survivors of cults and domestic abuse and will draw out important lessons for working to depolarize the political landscape. Lessons for how to actively listen and encourage respectful dialogue will be applied to the task of bridging the huge divides in society post the US election in 2024. The need for re-humanization and the fostering of common ground offers the prospect of positive pathways from radicalized movements (Horgan et al, 2017), building on understandings from decades of exit and rehabilitation work with victims and survivors of coercive control across multiple settings including cults and working with survivors on their divorce and custody cases.",

      "description": "ICSA International Conference 2025 - Montreal, QC \n-\nSunny Naughton\n-\nAbstract: This presentation explores the intersection of mental health literacy with the recognition of signs and symptoms associated with cult engagement. Cult involvement can profoundly impact a person\u2019s mental health, sense of self, and well-being, often manifesting in subtle behavioral, cognitive, and emotional changes that may be difficult to discern. Understanding these indicators can empower friends, family members, and mental health professionals to approach suspected cult engagement with empathy, awareness, and effective strategies for intervention. \nThe talk will begin by defining key elements of mental health literacy and cult engagement, drawing on recent research that identifies cognitive, social, and emotional patterns commonly seen in individuals who may be influenced by cult-like organizations. We will discuss changes in personality, loss of autonomy, isolation from previous social networks, heightened secrecy, and an increased dependency on the group or its leader. Attendees will learn how these signs intersect with broader mental health indicators, such as anxiety, depression, and identity confusion, which can emerge in cult-influenced individuals.\nEqually important is the emphasis on self-care for those providing support. Helping someone entangled in cult dynamics can be emotionally taxing, as it often requires sustained patience, boundaries, and resilience against potential emotional manipulation. This presentation will outline self-care practices that protect the mental well-being of helpers, including setting limits, engaging in regular debriefs, building a support system, and maintaining personal emotional boundaries.\nBy fostering awareness and self-care, this talk aims to equip participants with the tools to navigate these complex situations effectively, helping individuals transition to a healthier, more autonomous life while safeguarding their own mental health in the process.",

      "description": "ICSA International Conference 2025 - Montreal, QC \n-\nCheryl Bawtinheimer, Ben Woodbury, Richard Marsh\n-\nAbstract: \nSegment 1 \nWho we are, what we do and why\u2013 the history of Get-a-Life - Presented by Cheryl Bawtinheimer The Get-a-Life Podcast, launched in October 2022, was created by four former members of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC) as a platform for ex-members to share their stories and experiences. The podcast emerged in the wake of the church\u0027s ongoing \u201Cpropaganda war\u201D with its critics, which has included legal action to shut down anti-PBCC websites and blogs. The rise of social media in the 2010s provided a safer space for PBCC critics, with platforms like Facebook offering greater legal protection. Inspired by the success of media coverage, such as the Klondike Papers scandal, the podcast allows former members to speak out publicly. The podcast is recorded on Zoom, edited in Canada, and published on YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Podcasts, with episodes ranging from interviews with former PBCC members to discussions with cult experts. The format is informal, often emotional, and incorporates humor and satire. The podcast has grown beyond personal testimonies, now covering documentary-style episodes about specific issues, and has become a vital resource for those seeking to expose abuse and connect with others who have left high-demand groups like the PBCC.\nSegment 2 \nOpening doors and lighting up dark places \u2013 the surprising reach of Get-a-Life - Presented by Ben Woodbury The Get-a-Life Podcast has gone further than its founders anticipated, reaching three key audiences: \n1. Current Members: Despite strict monitoring of social media use within the PBCC, the podcast has found a way to reach current members, often through Dropbox links. These members access the content covertly, and some have cited the podcast as a catalyst for leaving the church. \n2. Former Members: The podcast is primarily aimed at former PBCC members, providing a platform for shared experiences. It has been especially supportive for LGBTQ\u002B former members excommunicated for their sexual orientation and survivors of sexual abuse within the church, helping them find validation and community. \n3. The Media: Public interest in the PBCC and other cultic groups has grown, leading journalists and documentary makers to approach the Get-a-Life team for insights and information. The podcast has become a valuable resource for media outlets covering the church and its controversial practices. Overall, the podcast has fostered connection, healing, and greater public awareness about the PBCC and its impact on individuals.\n\nSegment 3 \nInformation, vindication, joy and pain, \u2013 the impact of Get-a-Life Podcast - Presented by Richard Marsh The Get-a-Life Podcast has had a profound impact on its audiences, far beyond mere education. For former members, it provides therapeutic value, helping them process trauma and challenge false narratives spread by the church. Many use it as a platform to counter the PBCC\u0027s smear campaigns, offering a form of self-vindication. The podcast also connects former members, fostering support groups for those with shared experiences, such as survivors of sexual abuse or LGBTQ\u002B ex-members facing rejection. For current PBCC members, the podcast challenges the church\u0027s controlling narrative by showcasing the successes and happiness of exmembers, undermining the church\u0027s claims that leaving leads to failure. Additionally, the podcast exposes the hypocrisy and scandals of the PBCC leadership, such as financial misconduct and abusive incidents, which are often hidden from current members. The podcast\u0027s impact extends to the PBCC itself, enforcing an unprecedented level of accountability. Journalists and documentary makers use the podcast as a critical source of information, helping to shed light on the church\u2019s practices. By offering a platform for confidential whistleblowing, the podcast ensures that abuses are publicly exposed, making it a powerful tool for both healing and activism.",

      "description": "ICSA International Conference 2025 - Montreal, QC\n-\nLinda Dubrow-Marshall, Kate Amber, Jennifer French Tomasic, Ashley McLean\n-\nAbstract: It has often been challenging for mental health professionals to establish trust with former cult members who have experienced significant deception, manipulation, and betrayal. Dr. Linda Dubrow-Marshall will begin the discussion with suggestions for how mental health professionals can overcome these obstacles to provide a safe space for former members to examine their cultic experience and to begin a healing process that promotes posttraumatic growth and resiliency, as well as guiding family members to embark on a parallel journey that promotes healing for the individual and the family as a whole. Kate Amber will discuss the application of The Quicksand Model\u2122, a comprehensive trauma-informed and survivor-centered framework that amalgamates decades of research on coercive control. The QSM\u2122 combines images, alliterations and the metaphor of quicksand to quickly and effectively train professionals on coercive control from the perspective of the entrapped target. Jennifer French Tomasic will discuss her MSc dissertation research on how the Internal Family Systems model can usefully be applied to psychotherapy with survivors of coercive control. Dr. Erin Falconer will analyze the application of evidence-based and guidelines-based approaches to recovery from complex trauma and dissociation to cult recovery.\nAshley McLean will discuss challenges therapists will face in the recovery processes of working with multigenerational victims who have experienced coercion and how it is important for therapists to find a balance betweenfocusing on pre-abuse life events when in therapy and building identity during the therapeutic process. Ashley draws upon empirical insights from case studies. Dr. Linda Dubrow-Marshall will conclude the session with overarching principles of best practice for mental health interventions with former members and their families.",

      "title": "Addressing Spiritual Violence: A Transformative Change to Non-Violent Spirituality",
      "description": "ICSA International Conference 2025\n-\nAini Linjakumpu\n-\nAbstract: The presentation addresses spiritual violence, a form of physical or non-physical violence that a religious community exerts against its own members. It is justified by faith or membership in the religious community, and it violates a person\u0027s rights and reduces their possibility to define their own agency, spirituality, and future. The paper proposes a multilevel approach to tackling this issue: remediation, prevention, and direct intervention. Drawing on Susanne Moser\u2019s theory of transformative change, the presentation advocates for gradual, deep change to address spiritual violence by engaging stakeholders and fostering collaboration. It analyzes policies, practices, resource flows, relationships and connections, as well as institutional mindsets and power dynamics. \nBased on the idea of transformative change, the presentation identifies five key methods for addressing spiritual violence. The first is \u201Crecognizing errors\u201D by acknowledging past mistakes within religious communities, a process that helps shift from denial to responsibility. The second method, \u201Csupporting victims\u201D, stresses the importance of providing non-coercive, compassionate environments for both current and former members, ensuring that victims of spiritual violence feel safe regardless of their relationship to the community. Third, \u201Cinternal development\u201D calls for the development of new social practices and theologies that promote non-violent spirituality. This involves revisiting religious doctrines to allow for flexibility and growth, fostering peaceful and supportive spiritual practices. The fourth method is \u201Cdialogue and connection\u201D with society at large. Religious communities, such as churches and religious movements, should actively engage in societal conversations, collaborating with scholars, media, and other societal actors. The final method focuses on \u201Cstructural responsibility\u201D, urging the evaluation of laws and institutions to prevent spiritual abuse and support victims. This includes evaluating how societal structures can better prevent spiritual violence and support its victims.",

      "description": "ICSA International Conference - Montreal, QC\n-\nFabienne Harford, Rod Dubrow-Marshall\n-\nAbstract: This presentation will share findings about the ways in which coercive control may become embedded and reenacted through culture. Much of the literature on coercive control has focused on the intentions and influence of individual leaders. Within the area of Spiritual Abuse, existing research often focuses on an individual leader\u0027s personality or agenda. This research aimed to investigate to what degree cultural systems, structures, and language perpetuate coercive dynamics, perhaps unconsciously.\nDirected Content Analysis was used to analyze published materials from two organizations across two phases.\nFirst, 35 documents from a mega-church, referred to as \u201CChurch A,\u201D were analyzed. Church A was a leading force in the 2000\u2019s New Calvinist Movement and was closed in 2014 after its leader, referred to as Pastor A, stepped down following allegations of abuse of power. By exploring the culture of Church A outside the direct influence of Pastor A, this research sought to determine to what degree and in what ways coercive control was systematized.\nThe second phase of the research used DCA to explore materials from a related organization, referred to as \u201CChurch-Network.\u201D ChurchNetwork, is a non-profit, originally formed by Pastor A, which aims to launch new like-minded churches and support existing churches through training and finances. While Church-Network separated itself from Church A in 2014, and denounced Pastor A, this study sought to determine if any coercive cultural practices from Church A had been unconsciously replicated through the Church- Network, potentially perpetuating abuse. This research provides insights that could help identify patterns of Spiritual Abuse and supports the potential that cultural elements could replicate and enact coercion without intentionality or awareness. These findings could demonstrate the usefulness of new preventive measures that address culture and have implications for broader understanding and protections around coercion",

Mandated shunning is a structured and coercive practice, often enforced by high-control (cultic) religious authorities, that compels group members to ostracise those perceived as violating the community\u2019s key tenets. This social exclusion results from formal or informal directives demanding cessation of all social and familial connections with the individual involved. The psychological, social, and economic impact on the shunned individual is often profound and enduring.",

      "description": "ICSA International Conference 2025 - Montreal, QC\n-\nJean Brown; Co-authors : Glenn Patrick Doyle, Deborah Goldstein\n-\nAbstract: In 2005, \u201CThe Secret\u201D book and DVD blew up, touting the \u201CLaw of Attraction\u201D to the multi-billion dollar/year self-help consumer market. James Ray became one of the franchise\u2019s breakout stars, appearing multiple times on Oprah, as well as Larry King, The Today Show, and other mainstream media outlets. He was \u0022the next Tony Robbins.\u0022\nIn October 2009, Ray\u2019s success was halted abruptly when three people died at his Spiritual Warrior retreat in Sedona, Arizona. In the ensuing criminal trial, Ray was convicted of negligent homicide and served 20 months in prison. At that time, though the term \u201Ccult\u201D was sometimes included in the conversation about this tragedy, the lack of understanding and lack of educated mainstream discourse about cultic phenomena was such that the term did not feel appropriate to what had happened. Yet James Ray\u2019s use of cultlike tactics was clear.\nThis presentation will describe the role that the media played in enabling James Ray\u2019s quick rise to self-help fame, and how the media was unable to adequately contextualize the tragedy of Spiritual Warrior. We will also discuss how media coverage of cultic phenomena in recent years has changed, thereby shifting the popular perception of cults and cultic phenomenon. The preponderance of storytelling through podcasts, docu-series, and memoirs has, to some extent, destigmatized the term \u201Ccult\u201D while humanizing cult survivors. We will finally argue that the critical piece that media coverage must acknowledge is the link between the self-help industry and cults. Bridging these two ideas is necessary to protect consumers from abusive, cult-like leaders and groups.",

      "description": "ICSA 2025 Conference - Montreal, QC\n-\nEmma Antelo, Andrea Escudero\n-\nAbstract: Survivors of abusive and high-control groups face a unique and complex set of emotional, cognitive and social challenges as they work to rebuild their lives while healing from profound trauma. Coping refers to the ways individuals respond to stressful or traumatic events, as for example by seeking emotional support, planning, self-blaming, denying or avoiding certain feelings. Research shows that adaptative coping strategies can mitigate the adverse psychological effects of interpersonal violence. However, little is known about the specific coping style and strategies that former members of these groups use during their recovery after leaving the group. Thus, the objective is to identify profiles of coping styles in victims of abusive groups, and their relationship with the psychological abuse and psychosocial distress experienced. In this empirical study, more than 400 former members from different religious, pseudo-therapeutic, pyramidal, and other groups have shared their experiences. Through Latent Profile Analysis, we identified distinct coping profiles based on the 14 different coping strategies described in the literature. Are certain coping profiles more likely depending on factors such as gender, age joining the group, time since exit, or whether the person has received psychotherapeutic treatment? How has the abusive group experience shaped these coping responses? Are certain coping profiles linked to higher levels of psychological and social distress? By exploring these questions, our findings may help to understand the victimization and recovery experiences of survivors of abusive groups, highlighting the role of coping strategies in managing both trauma and dayto-day life. Furthermore, these insights may help to guide therapists and counselors in providing more tailored adjusted support for this population.",

In many instances, clinical treatments for mental health conditions in and of themselves are considered in these movements as doorways or entrance and access points for demons to enter the mind and body of the individual seeking help. Consequentially, these deliverance sessions have come to be seen as a sacred alternative to modern medical or psychological interventions. The purpose of this talk will be to present the results of a recent exploratory study documenting empirically the level of abuse and psychological distress amongst survivors of deliverance ministries and to introduce a new psychometric designed to bridge the gap between the spiritual and psychophysiological realms, recently piloted successfully for the University of Salford, to measure said abuses, called the Deliverance Ministry Abuse Scale (DMAS).",

      "description": "ICSA 2025 Conference - Montreal, QC\n-\nHeidi Clemons\n-\nAbstract: Cult leavers and survivors often have a difficult time managing their personal financial responsibilities long after their coercive and controlling experiences have ended. The emotional and psychological distress caused by their experiences with money impairs their judgment and has significant influence in their money habits and behaviors, often leading to self-harmful money choices. A lack of adequate financial literacy continues to hinder trust and progress forward to develop adequate and healthy financial practices, made harder by the perception that personal finances are a socially taboo topic. Working closely with those who have experienced this level of financial abuse can change the trajectory of the survivor\u2019s relationship with money and positively influence their future money decisions. Due to this financial trauma, it is necessary to provide a safe, non-judgmental, and empathetic environment for the survivor to explore their own money story, understand how it influences their financial decisions, and add the layers of financial literacy that have been missing. Through demystifying and normalizing the discussion of personal finances, and through sound financial therapy and literacy education, those working with cult leavers and survivors can facilitate and foster a new financial paradigm that will enable survivors to thrive.",

      "description": "ICSA 2025 Conference - Montreal, QC\n-\nSarah Feliciano; Co Authors: Chitra Raghavan\n-\nAbstract: The present study utilized the coercive control framework to systematically assess coercion in cults. Former cult members (N=121) from various groups (e.g., psychological \u0026 self-help related) were interviewed via telephone for 1.5 to 3 hours. The sample was diverse; 63.64% female, 77.69% Caucasian, and 71.07% American; age ranged from 18-68 years old. An existing codebook of coercive control tactics was used by multiple coders with high interrater reliability (93.18%). Coercive control tactics were present in all 121 narratives. Of the eight coercion tactics queried, manipulation, intimidation, and microregulation were most frequently reported. Sexual coercion/abuse, deprivation, and degradation were reported least. The primary coercer(s) identified varied considerably, as over half of participants reported the collective group as equally responsible in their abuse (56.20%) and a fraction of participants reported a pair or small team of individuals as equally abusive (10.74%). Data also provided coercive subtactics specific to cults but rarely noted in sex trafficking or intimate partner violence settings, allowing for a nuanced understanding of abuse. Overall, findings suggest the coercive control framework can be reliably used to assess how power imbalances are created and maintained in cults to entrap members. This is the first application of coercion control to cultic study of its kind, with strong implications for improved communication between cult researchers. Similarities and differences across interpersonal abuse contexts will be discussed.",

      "description": "ICSA 2025 Conference - Montreal, QC \n-\nCyrus Abbasian\n-\nA Psychiatrist\u2019s Perspective of Cults - Extremist Violence \u0026 Vulnerability in Mental Health and Neurodiversity\n-\nAbstract: This presentation aims to examine the complex dynamics between violence, extremism, mental health, and neurodiversity, particularly in cultlike contexts. It explores how individuals with conditions such as ADHD and Autism, often coexisting with mental health issues, including substance misuse, may be at risk of cultassociated extremist involvement. Patients with anxiety, depression, and drug/alcohol misuse are more vulnerable to cult membership and exploitation, leading to extremism. Issues like reduced insight, lack of capacity, and safeguarding concerns will be discussed, with a focus on mental health factors that can leave vulnerable patients susceptible to manipulation and recruitment into extremist ideology. Drawing on clinical cases, I will illustrate how trauma and psychiatric diagnoses can predispose individuals to cult-linked extremist risks. Neurodiversity can make individuals more vulnerable to extremist influence. Special focus will be placed on the UK\u2019s Mental Health Act and safeguarding principles. Additionally, I will explore overlaps with PTSD, addiction, suicidality, and dissociation. This presentation also aims to provide a psychiatric framework for understanding the risks faced by neurodiverse individuals in cult settings, and offer treatment strategies. I am not an expert in cults. However, I have 25 years of experience as a clinician working in the UK, and during this time, I have assessed and treated patients vulnerable to cult influence, some of whom have been convicted and imprisoned for related extremism. An important aspect of any mental health risk assessment should include vulnerability to cult exploitation, and current legislation does not sufficiently prevent this. Similarly, training for clinicians is lacking, as cult membership is often considered a personal choice. Given the associated harms, there is a need for more robust clinical interest and scrutiny of cult membership, especially among vulnerable psychiatric patients, with appropriate staff training, so this form of coercive control is taken more seriously.",

      "title": "Self-Care Practices as an Aspect of Religious Trauma Recovery",
      "description": "ICSA 2025 Conference - Montreal, QC\n-\nLiz Sallows\n-\nAbstract: There are many aspects involved in recovery from cultic and religious abuse. Cultic abuse often carries with it the concept of putting one\u2019s self or personhood aside for the betterment of the cultic organization. The teaching, both overt and covert, that one is less than worthwhile, damages the innate sense of who we are and who we can be. The reduction of self worth, shown by not caring for specific needs, not listening when someone speaks, not validating concerns and feelings, or being told the base nature is wrong, suspect or even evil, can develop an inner struggle of acceptance that one has value after all. A significant area of recovery from this abuse is the development of a healthy sense of self, along with a firm sense of personal self-worth. While this recovery can take time, the development of an understanding of the advantages of a self-care practice as a tool to enable recovery has been seen to be significantly helpful. This understanding is helpful for those who are first generation survivors, and those who have left as further generations. This will be a presentation of what self-care truly is and how self-care can be so beneficial to those who have experienced cultic and religious abuse. The presentation will share how self-care can be presented and implemented, for professionals in the field of trauma recovery, as well as those who are assisting friends and family members who are in the process of reclaiming themselves.",

      "description": "ICSA 2025 Conference - Montreal, QC\n-\nAndrea Silverstone\n-\nAbstract: This session presents findings from a PhD research study examining peer-based interventions for survivors of coercive control in contexts such as cults, intimate partner violence (IPV), and sexual exploitation. Practitioners from diverse fields\u2014therapists, social workers, advocates, faith leaders, and lawyers\u2014will gain insights into the various types of peer-based interventions, their strengths and challenges, and evidence-based recommendations for effective practice. Peer-based treatment models have proven effective in empowering individuals through recovery narratives, fostering selfefficacy, and promoting connection. Research highlights their value for individuals recovering from coercive control, as such groups provide opportunities to relate to peers with shared experiences, aiding in the reconstruction of personal identity separate from the perpetrator\u0027s influence. This session explores various peer support approaches, including secular, faithbased, and trauma-informed models, supported by research from Alberta et al. (2015), Buckle et al. (2014), and Goldberg (2017). Evidence suggests that psycho-educational recovery methods, when integrated with flexible methodologies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Transtheoretical Models (TTM), are highly effective. Structured, intensive interventions, such as 16-week programs, yield significant improvements in reducing depression and increasing social support. The findings emphasize that peer-based support can be applied effectively in both individual and group settings, tailoring interventions to the unique needs of survivors. This session will synthesize research and practical insights from practitioners, fostering a deeper understanding of how peer-based interventions can empower survivors to rebuild their lives. Recommendations will address strategies for implementation, highlighting adaptability and the importance of shared lived experiences in facilitating recovery.",

It is a form of in-group love that is focused on an idealized self-image and feels threatened by a hated out-group. It can be assessed through four factors: Arrogance, admiration, entitlement and exploitation, and apathy towards others. This presentation will provide an overview of Collective Narcissism and its components.

Elle puise ses origines dans un mouvement br\u00E9silien d\u2019extr\u00EAme-droite : Tradition, Famille et Propri\u00E9t\u00E9 (TFP) et de son fondateur, Plinio Corr\u00EAa de Oliveira (1908-1995). Derri\u00E8re un combat id\u00E9ologique se cachait cependant une vocation mystique : la croyance dans une apocalypse imminente, nomm\u00E9e \u00E0 l\u0027interne par le mot fran\u00E7ais \u0022Bagarre\u0022, en vue d\u0027instaurer sur terre un R\u00E8gne marial au moyen d\u2019un ordre de chevalerie. Apr\u00E8s 1995, Jo\u00E3o Cl\u00E1 Dias (1939-2024) recentrera le mouvement, abandonnera tout aspect pol\u00E9mique pour se focaliser sur l\u2019\u00E9vang\u00E9lisation et sera approuv\u00E9 par le Vatican en 2001, mais \u00E0 l\u2019interne il y aura une radicalisation. Dans la vingtaine de pays o\u00F9 les HE sont \u00E9tablis, des activit\u00E9s sont organis\u00E9es dans le but de recruter des adolescents pour qu\u0027ils deviennent moines, esclaves et guerriers. \u00C0 la suite de plaintes, le Vatican a nomm\u00E9 en 2019 un commissaire pontifical, un processus opaque qui ne semble pas avoir donn\u00E9 de r\u00E9sultats concrets. Un proc\u00E8s a aussi \u00E9t\u00E9 initi\u00E9 \u00E0 S\u00E3o Paulo pour ali\u00E9nation parentale, torture, humiliations, abus physiques, psychologiques et sexuels.

      "description": "ICSA 2025 Conference - Montreal, QC\n-\nCarol Merchasin, Pamela Takefman\n-\nAbstract: One of the goals of survivors and their supporters is to hold cults accountable and ensure that others do not suffer abuse. But speaking out often comes with risks -- being ostracized, potential threats to physical safety, and, in today\u2019s legal climate, the risk of lawsuits. Cults often use defamation lawsuits to silence critics and survivors. This presentation will explore the essential elements of defamation, providing clear guidelines on holding cults accountable while avoiding legal pitfalls. We\u2019ll begin by examining what constitutes defamation \u2014specifically the false statement of fact that damages reputation, made with malice or negligence. Understanding these elements is crucial for those speaking out to ensure their words don\u2019t become the target of legal action. Next, we will discuss practical strategies to avoid defamation in spoken and written communications. This includes using verifiable facts, avoiding inflammatory language, and framing opinions clearly as opinions. Transparency and fact-checking are key to making strong statements without crossing legal lines. We\u2019ll also cover the status of AntiSLAPP (Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation) laws, which are designed to protect individuals speaking out on matters of public concern from retaliatory lawsuits. While these laws vary by jurisdiction, understanding how they can offer protection is vital for those challenging powerful groups like cults. Finally, we will outline what steps survivors can take if they are sued, including the importance of retaining legal counsel, dealing with frivolous claims, building a robust defense, and possibly countersuing for damages under Anti-SLAPP statutes. By the end of this session, attendees will have the tools to speak out against cult abuse while minimizing the risk of defamation claims",

Situating CSA in a broader context, it will reference recent events underscoring the crisis of abuse in faith settings, such as the United Kingdom Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA), the findings of the New Zealand Royal Commission of Inquiry on Abuse in Care and the Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to child sexual abuse (2017) and more recently Justin Welby\u2019s resignation as Archbishop of Canterbury. The core of the paper will highlight the findings from a large-scale survey run by the University of Salford, designed to explore the psychological well-being of former members of cultic group. It will focus on CSA within high-demand religious groups, gathering insights from over 600 respondents of the total sample of over 1100. This data, which reveals patterns of abuse prevalence, institutional responses, and the long-term impacts on survivors contributes new understanding to the complex dynamics within closed communities that may enable abuse, underscoring the need for targeted policies to improve transparency, accountability, and support for survivors in cultic group based contexts.",

      "description": "ICSA Conference 2025 - Montreal, QC\n-\nSomatic Psychotherapy for Cult Recovery: for Therapists and Survivors\n-\nNicola Ranson\n-\nAbstract: This presentation addresses how to safely access the wisdom of the body using somatic interventions. Topics include: Why resistance should be revered, how connecting to the environment through the senses can reduce hyper-vigilance, how the experience of pleasure can be a radical act, and how cultivating a feltsense of safety can be an antidote for a nervous system habituated to danger. Somatic psychotherapy is based on the body\u2019s innate capacity to return to a state of selfregulation. It can be inherently empowering (and healing) to experience the source of one\u2019s personal wellbeing as firmly located within our own physiology \u2014 the opposite of cultic indoctrination which externalizes agency. Somatic approaches have found their way into mainstream psychotherapy as trauma survivors and providers realize that a top-down cognitive approach can\u2019t always address symptoms that are experienced in the body. However, invoking physical sensations by using somatic approaches can be tricky. For a cult survivor who has been abused by someone in a position of power, a therapist\u2019s somatic interventions can sometimes feel more intrusive than regular psychotherapy, and well-intended psychotherapists may end up re-traumatizing their clients. Through both lecture and experiential exercises, Ranson draws from over 25 years of clinical experience and demonstrates how somatic psychotherapy can make it easier for therapists to see the subtle dynamics of trauma reenactment and find safe and appropriate interventions.",

      "description": "ICSA Conference 2025 - Montreal, QC\n-\nCaroline Ansley\n-\nAbstract: The medical workforce represent an influential body who are often as ignorant about the needs of cult-impacted people as the general population. They often have access to those still inside a cult \u2014 who either directly ask for aid from a doctor outside the group when they are unwell or injured, or are forced to access medical care due to urgency. The person may or may not disclose to their doctor that they are in a cult, though there are often clues for the astute and educated professional. Front line medical staff in New Zealand generally lack both the basic knowledge about cult activity, the ability to recognise a person who is in such a group, and the skills to support their recovery in a non-judgmental and trustbuilding way. In 2023 and 2024 a guidance was developed in New Zealand for health-workers - primarily for doctors, nurses and nurse practitioners - to use when consulting with people who either self-disclose that they are cult-impacted, or who rouse suspicion of such in the clinician. This guidance was developed with input from approximately 30 frontline health workers, survivors, and researchers. It is hosted by an online password protected website, which is used at point-of-care by community-based clinicians all over New Zealand on a day-to-day basis in their medical consultations. The publication of this guidance to support cultinformed clinical consultations increases substantially the possibility that cult-impacted people will find allies in their doctors, that their doctors will gain the important skills needed to approach them and engage their trust, and that health delivery will be better targeted to the specific medical needs to those traumatised by cults. In this presentation the author will describe the process whereby the guidance was developed and the response to the roll-out of the guidance across New Zealand.",

      "description": "ICSA Conference 2025 - Montreal, QC\nEmily Lehsten \n\n- \nAbstract: The purpose of my talk is to disseminate the results of my dissertation, which I completed at the University of Salford in Manchester, UK, under the supervision of Linda Dubrow-Marshall. I performed a qualitative case study that examined the lived experiences of six male former cult members over 18 using semistructured interviews and a demographic questionnaire to answer the questions: what experiences did these men go through, and why do these experiences matter? My research indicated that the victimisation of men in coercively controlling cultic environments is both similar and different to the abuses that women suffer. As there is little research on the abuses that men suffer in these environments, I used a thematic analysis to determine the themes across male experiences. Four themes presented themselves: Language is Key. Totalitarian language is woven into the men\u2019s stories and plays a crucial role in control. 2. The Many Faces of Abuse. Each of the men survived many types of abuse, including spiritual, psychological, and sexual. 3. Achievement As a Means of Coercion. Achievement is used as justification for punishment. 4. The Aftermath. This theme looks at the trauma suffered by these men as it impacts their post-cult lives. The experiences of these men are relevant as their plight has been overlooked in the wake of radical feminism, hegemonic masculinity, and harmful stereotypes. The problem arises when men are not taken seriously in their efforts to obtain help once they leave their cultic environment. This research aims to shed light on the victimisation of men in coercively controlling cultic environments to spur further research and policy practice to provide a serious yet compassionate response to abused men.",

A Thrilling Memoir of a Radical Identity Change and Survival\n-\nCathrine Moestue \n-\nAbstract: \u0022What happens when a life consumed by a cult becomes a powerful story of survival and resilience? Join me as I unveil the truth behind my memoir \u0027The Cult - They Called Me Roxy.\u0027\u0022 \nWould you participate if you had a chance to join a movement that could end world hunger? This is what my teacher in moral philosophy offered me when I was a 19-year-old student at Stockholm University back in 1984, with the historical backdrop of the famine in Ethiopia and a world that came together in Aid for Africa. I said yes to him, not knowing that his program was a scam, not knowing he operated under a false identity, not knowing I would be trapped for seven years. I came to believe in a conspiracy theory that changed my worldview upside down. I adopted beliefs that isolated me from my family and my authentic self. I became \u00ABRoxy\u00BB. Following the release of my book in September 2024, I have been invited to share my narrative across various media platforms, providing a unique opportunity to engage in a broader dialogue about cultic phenomena. In this presentation, I will not only show the audience the trajectory of the different stages of identity change that I went through from the 19-year-old \u00ABcheerful Cathrine\u00BB to becoming a stern \u00ABmoralistic Roxy,\u00BB but also explore the shifting perception of cults in my country. I will share personal pictures and describe how moral philosophy was used as a tool for manipulation and share with you a unique and personal insight into the radicalisation process and its push and pull factors. Together, we will explore the transformative power of storytelling and media in reshaping societal views, ultimately advocating for a more informed and compassionate approach to understanding the complexities of cult involvement.",

      "description": "ICSA Conference 2025 - Montreal, QC\n-\nYuval Laor\n-\nAbstract: This lecture will concern the relationship between awe and humor (not laughter), arguing that these are psychologically incompatible. I maintain that understanding this relationship can, in some cases, help people in their recovery from cultic abuse. There are three main theories of humor. First is humor as incongruity, where something is funny when it makes people realize that they were mistaken. Such humor is incompatible with awe because, unlike humor, awe makes people feel that something is \u201Creally real.\u201D The next theory of humor connects it with playfulness, and being unserious. This conflicts with awe which makes people feel that something is serious and important. Finally, we have humor that makes people look down on something by laughing at it. This is incompatible with awe, which often makes people feel that they are in the presence of something greater than themselves. In my past lectures at ICSA conferences concerned the emotion of awe, and its central role in cultic recruitment and other cultic dynamics. As such, memories connected to one\u2019s former cult are likely to be coupled with awe, an association that could hinder recovery. I argue that the awe coupled with memories of the cult can be expunged by laughing at cult\u2019s leadership and at one\u2019s experiences and behaviors in the cult (when it is possible). Removing the awe connected to people\u2019s memories of their former cult, can help them integrate what happened to them with the rest of their memories, which is likely to accelerate recovery. This means that laughing at the cult\u2019s leaders, practices and beliefs can be used to facilitate recovery. I suspect that particularly effective is meeting with other former members, where \u201Cinside jokes\u201D can be used to laugh at a shared cultic past.",

      "description": "ICSA Conference 2025 - Montreal, QC\n-\nIntergenerational Transmission of Cult Trauma: The Impact of Cult-Created Dissociation and a Cult-Created Harsh Conscience on Child-Rearing\n-\nLorna Goldberg, Doni Whitsett, William Goldberg; Co-authors : Dan Spence\n-\nAbstract: As a result of cult trauma and ongoing cult practices, typically, cult parents are living in a cult-induced dissociative state, which interferes with their ability to self-reflect and provide an empathic connection with their children. Instead, cult parents become malleable in following the self-serving demands of their leader rather than following their own inclinations. Typically, cult practices leave their children vulnerable to emotional and physical neglect and abuse. To illustrate this process, the speaker will describe a relationship between a second-generation mother and her third-generation son. This relationship will be presented as an example of intergenerational transmission of cult trauma. To clarify this process, the speaker will define \u201Cdissociation\u201D and examine theories of early development, including how the mother-child early relationship impacts the brain and nervous system. This will provide insight into the thirdgeneration son\u2019s early life experience and the consequences for adulthood. The speaker also will discuss the post-cult recovery process for a mother and her son, including the impact of collaborating on this paper. She will offer therapeutic recommendations for working with former cult members, highlighting the need to address transference and countertransference reactions, cult-induced dissociation and dysregulation, as well as the harsh conscience created by the cult.",

Situating CSA in a broader context, it will reference recent events underscoring the crisis of abuse in faith settings, such as the United Kingdom Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA), the findings of the New Zealand Royal Commission of Inquiry on Abuse in Care and the Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to child sexual abuse (2017) and more recently Justin Welby\u2019s resignation as Archbishop of Canterbury.\nThe core of the paper will highlight the findings from a large-scale survey run by the University of Salford, designed to explore the psychological well-being of former members of cultic group. It will focus on CSA within high-demand religious groups, gathering insights from over 600 respondents of the total sample of over 1100. This data, which reveals patterns of abuse prevalence, institutional responses, and the long-term impacts on survivors contributes new understanding to the complex dynamics within closed communities that may enable abuse, underscoring the need for targeted policies to improve transparency, accountability, and support for survivors in cultic group based contexts.",

      "description": "ICSA Conference 2025 - Montreal, QC\n-\nDissociation and Mindfulness: Mental Health Needs and Coping Strategies of Youth Raised in Cultic and High-Control Groups\n-\nLuna Cappelletti; Co-authors : Andra Smith, Angela Katherine Boland, William Wright\n-\nAbstract: Young people experience many stressors and have found variable methods to deal with them. Some, but certainly not an exhaustive list, include mindfulness, drug and/or alcohol use, religiosity, and dissociation. Each one can involve an altered state of consciousness. Mindfulness is a mental state characterized by the ability to be attentive and accepting of the present moment, and has been highlighted in recent years as a valuable stress management technique. Conversely, dissociation is marked by a discontinuity between the self and physical experiences, resulting in detachment from the present moment. Although dissociation is generally seen as pathological, examples of both dissociation and mindfulness practices can be found in various religious practices, and little research has compared the two in the context of religion. This relationship may be further complicated for former members of cultic and high-control religious groups, where practices like meditation that are often associated with mindfulness are sometimes used to elicit a disconnect from the self and the environment in a problematic way. In this presentation, we examine recent data collected from a university student sample and two community samples and compare scores of religiosity, mindfulness, substance use, dissociation, and well-being between current and former members of major and cultic/high-control religious groups. We also contextualize past mindfulness and dissociation research to cultic studies and highlight the potential drawbacks and benefits of comparing former members of major versus cultic and highcontrol religious groups in a research context.",

In this session Beth and Jacqueline will discuss the complexities and challenges of pursuing legal action against their abusers, drawing from their deeply personal journeys. As former students of a cult masquerading as an elite Canadian boarding school, they will share their compelling narratives, and the lessons learned throughout a 16-year legal battle. Granger and Gagnon will start with an overview of their unique experiences\u2014Jacqueline\u0027s early recognition of cult behavior and Beth\u0027s realization after escaping decades of indoctrination. This will set the stage for revealing what they learned about harnessing the justice system to hold their abusers accountable. They will share many lessons they learned along the way that would have helped them from the outset. Spoiler alert: Suing a cult, even one that went bankrupt, is not for the faint of heart. However, looking back, Beth and Jacqueline have no regrets. Despite the toll of litigation, they aim to illustrate how the journey led to healing and even societal change, setting legal precedents for future victims of systemic abuse.\nBeth and Jacqueline are not legal experts and aren\u2019t able to offer legal advice. They are, however, well acquainted with the challenges cult survivors might face when pursuing justice. This session will resonate with former cult members, mental health professionals, legal advocates, and anyone interested in the intersection of trauma, justice, and recovery. Their presentation will not only educate attendees about the legal landscape surrounding cults but also inspire them to reclaim their narratives.

High-control groups often impose rigid, unorthodox belief systems and restrictive social practices, making disaffiliation, disassociation, disfellowshipping, and shunning a complex and emotional process.\nThe following five research questions guided this study: How do current and former JW members of high-control groups navigate their transition out of the group, particularly regarding emotional, social, and spiritual adjustments? What are the primary challenges that current and former JW members of high-control groups face when dealing with the effects of group affiliation or disaffiliation? What intervention strategies can support current and former JW members in rebuilding healthy relationships and reintegrating into society? How do current and former JW members of high-control groups reconcile their past belief systems with their current values and worldviews? and What role do professionals (counselors, therapists, religious leaders, and many other professionals) play in facilitating effective interventions for current and former JW members?

In this lecture, I will outline some of the center\u0027s core tools and strategies, drawing on real-life case studies and examples to illustrate the challenges and solutions encountered in this critical work. Despite Israel\u0027s relatively small population of under 10 million, over 150 active cults have been documented. As the sole national resource dedicated to cult victims and their families, the Center has developed a holistic \u0022360-degree\u0022 approach to address a wide range of needs, from mental health support and legal counsel to assistance navigating social benefits, guidance through judicial processes, and efforts to dismantle harmful cult structures. Throughout the presentation, I will share key real-world scenarios, including: How the Center approaches the initial interaction with cult victims, ensuring their immediate safety and emotional support. -A case in which a cult leader was discovered operating within a statesupervised shelter for at-risk youth, and the steps taken to address this serious issue; the protocols followed when criminal acts related to cults are reported, and the challenges of navigating the legal system in these cases; the various services that cult victims and their families require, and the importance of offering flexible, tailored support to meet their diverse needs; the Center\u2019s response when Goel Ratzon, the leader of a notorious polygamous cult, was not convicted of enslavement despite widespread evidence of abuse. These examples will illustrate the complexities of working with cult victims, and highlight the Center\u2019s best practices for providing comprehensive, compassionate, and effective support. I will also discuss how these strategies can be adapted in different cultural and legal contexts to maximize their impact.",

We\u0027ll also deal with how lawyers can use the media in the interests of the proceedings, and play a preventive role regarding these issues.\nThe lawyer will need to use both the role of the traditional media and that of the new \u201Cmedia\u201D in order to broaden the dissemination of information. The judicious use of the media can be highly beneficial in bringing a case to trial. But the lawyer will have to fight against society\u0027s perception about sectarian phenomenon which is sometimes wrong. The same perception of the sectarian phenomenon, is more often conveyed by the media. This misperception can even be disseminated in courts and tribunals, by also legal professionals. However, preventive information can be beneficial in combating a perception of the sectarian phenomenon which is not in line with reality. We will therefore begin by examining how lawyers can play a preventive role in combating misinformation about sectarian phenomena (I) and, secondly, how the lawyer must fight for a proper trial and a fair assessment of the sectarian phenomenon, despite the image conveyed within society and/or by the media (II).",

      "description": "ICSA International Conference 2025 - Montreal, QC\n-\nPoints tournants dans les trajectoires de vie : comment les membres sortants de premi\u00E8re et de multig\u00E9n\u00E9ration construisent leur sortie et leur vie audel\u00E0 des groupes \u00E0 haute intensit\u00E9 d\u2019engagement\n-\nC\u00E9leste Goguen\n-\nAbstract: This presentation will describe the role that the media played in enabling James Ray\u2019s quick rise to self-help fame, and how the media was unable to adequately contextualize the tragedy of Spiritual Warrior. We will also discuss how media coverage of cultic phenomena in recent years has changed, thereby shifting the popular perception of cults and cultic phenomenon. The preponderance of storytelling through podcasts, docu-series, and memoirs has, to some extent, destigmatized the term \u201Ccult\u201D while humanizing cult survivors. We will finally argue that the critical piece that media coverage must acknowledge is the link between the self-help industry and cults. Bridging these two ideas is necessary to protect consumers from abusive, cult-like leaders and groups.\nCette communication vise \u00E0 identifier les \u00AB points tournants \u00BB, c\u2019est-\u00E0-dire les moments que les ex-membres de premi\u00E8re g\u00E9n\u00E9ration et de multig\u00E9n\u00E9ration reconnaissent comme d\u00E9terminants dans leur d\u00E9cision de quitter le groupe. Ces points de bascule sont \u00E9galement importants pour leur capacit\u00E9 \u00E0 s\u2019adapter \u00E0 la vie en dehors du groupe. Pour ce faire, nous analyserons les r\u00E9cits de 21 personnes qui ont v\u00E9cu dans des groupes haute intensit\u00E9 d\u2019engagement. En adoptant une approche narrative, il ne s\u2019agira pas seulement de relater les \u00E9v\u00E9nements individuels, mais de comprendre comment ces moments ont fa\u00E7onn\u00E9 et influenc\u00E9 leurs comportements apr\u00E8s leur sortie. Comme le souligne Presser (2015), \u00AB les individus ont tendance \u00E0 agir en coh\u00E9rence avec les r\u00E9cits qu\u2019ils construisent sur eux-m\u00EAmes \u00BB (p. 70).",

The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: One of the challenges in the pursuit of justice in relation to abusive religious cults is galvanizing authorities into action. Using KwaSizabantu Mission in South Africa as a case study, this paper examines how ex-members involved the media and how the subsequent media expos\u00E9 prompted authorities to investigate KSB, paying particular attention to the ongoing role of trauma in the lives of the survivors. It is well-documented that ongoing trauma symptoms have a direct bearing on the ability of former members to participate in legal and investigative processes to pursue justice and hold the perpetrators accountable.\n\nThe paper will give a brief overview of the childhood trauma experienced at KwaSizabantu as documented in the testimonies of survivors and the ongoing spiritual, physical, social, and psychological manifestations of childhood trauma throughout adulthood in the lives of those who have left KwaSizabantu. Using personal testimonies and video footage, we will discuss the impact of ongoing trauma, the media exposure, and investigative procedures on survivors attempting to seek justice. This will be done with a view to understanding broader ethical considerations in the handling of survivor testimonies. Specifically, the challenges of trauma-informed representation to aid survivors in speaking out will be examined in reference to the approach taken by investigative panels, the media, and KwaSizabantu itself. Because these investigations have coincided with the COVID pandemic, consideration will also be given to some of the ways in which lockdowns and restrictions mitigated or contributed to further trauma for the survivors.",

The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: The PsychoSocial Quicksand Model\u2122 is an educational resource and toolkit designed to help survivors, families, and the public better understand the nature of coercive control in abusive relationships and groups. The research reported in this presentation is a mixed-methods investigation into the validity and effectiveness of the PSQM\u2122 involving interviews and the completion of questionnaires. Participants (N=59) were recruited online and are a mixture of survivors of intimate partner violence, cults (both forms of coercion), and professionals in the field. Each participant watched a series of seven videos about the model and completed a series of evaluative questions about how helpful the model was to them. They also completed a series of questionnaires about their own experiences of coercive control and mental health. A subset of the participants (n=13) also volunteered to be interviewed about their experience of learning about the model. Analysis of the qualitative data indicated that the model was well received, with a broad theme reflecting core aspects of the model and a theme reflecting survivors\u0027 stories, indicating a good degree of resonance between the model and prior experiences. Quantitative analysis indicated that, with some of the model videos and questions, the survivors (some of whom were also professionals) showed greater appreciation than participants who were professionals with no survivor experiences. This is further evidence that the model reflects survivor experience and is potentially helpful to survivor recovery. Additional analysis indicates the extent to which reported levels of coercion and mental health vary according to participant group and following, as well as prior to, the watching of the model videos. There are some key implications for the further development of the PSQM\u2122 and for education, practice, and professionals in the field that need to be disseminated more widely.",

The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: In writing about my own experience thirty-five years after leaving Yogi Bhajan\u0027s cult of the American Sikhs, I have come to the conclusion that \u0022you can take a person out of a cult, but it is much harder to take the cult out of a person,\u0022 to paraphrase a common saying. Cults have a profound impact on every aspect of a person\u0027s identity and well-being, influencing their appearance, worldview, sense of agency, ethical framework, spiritual superiority, sense of shame, and more. Recovering from a cult entails reclaiming an authentic sense of identity, free from the distorted norms imposed by the cult in virtually every aspect of life. These norms are often deeply ingrained, and ex-cult members may not even be aware of their origin or their ongoing influence on their lives.\n\nFor instance, many eastern spiritual cults promote the belief in past life \u0022karma\u0022 as a determinant of current situations, such as social status within the cult or the justification for unethical behavior, such as sexual abuse by the cult leader. Since most cults consume every aspect of a person\u0027s beliefs, attitudes, practices, and lifestyle, former members face immense challenges to their sense of identity upon leaving, and it often takes many years to confront the lingering effects of the cult.\n\nThis presentation will delve into the various factors that continue to exert destructive influence even after physically leaving a cult, providing insights into the lasting impact on individuals. Additionally, it will offer options and strategies for regaining a healthy and authentic sense of identity.",

The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: When war breaks out, people can go through a training regime so they are ready to face the war on both sides. The skills taught can seem outrageous within a non-war situation. It can also seem at odds with human rights even within a war situation. So, one might see skills to use weapons as important but other tactics are less noted such as rape or captivity.\n\nPeople are also trained how to hold people captive or rape as the other side are seen as the enemy or subhuman even if say in a civil war, they lived close to each other. Rape can bring a feeling of shame so those that experienced this are less likely to say what happened or be believed.\n\nSo, during or after the war people who are trained may go abroad and even reach places like the United Kingdom. They will use tactics they learned in or for war to use on people not within a war zone. Sometimes if a survivor escapes it will be seen as domestic violence rather than war trauma which has a different flavour. They may say all authority figures such as police, military, the court system, religion etc will shoot you if you look at them. They may describe exactly which weapon they will use. It can make life after terrifying and one feels they will get killed just being in public. They may encourage you to act in ways that don\u2019t even make sense once away from the captivity.\n\nSo, what options do people have if they reached safety and are too scared to talk? I will also discuss what can help in the Western world.",

The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: During this time of COVID, our level of fear has risen greatly. People are afraid because of the ongoing and virulent nature of this illness, as well as its unpredictability. The fact that it can be so communicable and also have a long-lasting impact has caused a sharp increase in interest in conspiratorial thinking, psychics, healers, shamans, channelers, and the like who tout magical energy cures or peddle pseudoscience and protective potions.\n\nSimultaneously, there has been a lessening of civility and the impossibility, at times, of having a conversation about this issue without it erupting into a fight. Families and communities have been torn apart, and people have dealt with increasing isolation caused by social distancing and discord.\n\nAs we know, cult leaders and those pushing pseudoscience take advantage of these moments, providing replacement communities and preying on people\u0027s fears in order to ensnare them. This presentation will explore what causes us to say \u0022yes\u0022 to people offering us community and protection when there is a part of us inside doubting that this is the answer. It will investigate what people can be compelled to ignore within themselves and why good and important questions remain unasked.",

The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: Spiritual abuse is often an integral part of other experiences of harm and abuse for those in faith communities and related contexts. This paper will present some of the findings of a recent study conducted in the UK in partnership between a Christian domestic violence charity and a charity for divorced or separated clergy spouses/partners. The study focused on developing understanding and effective support for victims of domestic abuse in the Christian faith community. 199 respondents completed an online survey, of whom 69% had experienced domestic violence. Among these respondents, 60% had concurrently experienced spiritual abuse, highlighting the inter-relationship between these forms of harm. The paper will explore experiences of spiritual abuse within the context of domestic violence, including a discussion of key passages, teachings, and values identified as contributors to experiences of domestic abuse, as well as those that were seen as potentially helpful for those who have experienced this form of abuse. Importantly, it will draw on survivor suggestions for prevention, intervention, and response.",

The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: My presentation will discuss persistent challenges in Scientology research and the way forward. In my previous research, I analyzed the significance of expertise in grounding and justifying a religion\u0027s claim of legitimacy in the eyes of the law. I traced the emergence of CESNUR and, more broadly, a community of scholars who take a notably more favorable stance on Scientology, influencing the diversity of Scientology research. While I, like others, have criticized the rigor of their research, it will undoubtedly impact legal and political decision-makers. Building on my previous research, my presentation will explore the academic approaches and theories employed by these scholars in their analysis of Scientology. I will discuss and aim to refute their main assertion that prior to their involvement, Scientology research lacked sophistication by (1) focusing on Scientology\u0027s organizational behavior instead of its theology, beliefs, and practices, and (2) overly relying on testimonies from former members.\n\nWhile it is true that previous Scientology research has sometimes failed to distinguish adequately between Scientology\u0027s beliefs and organizational behavior, there are substantive legal and analytical justifications for studying Scientology\u0027s organizational behavior. Due to the comprehensive nature of Scientology\u0027s belief and governance system, its organizational behavior is often driven by and inseparable from its theology. Focusing solely on Scientology\u0027s theology presents an incomplete and misleading portrayal. A comprehensive and accurate understanding of Scientology, on the other hand, acknowledges its differences from other religions and new religious movements.\n\nThe criticism of relying on the testimonies of former members is, although not explicitly stated, ideological and misguided. It can partly be attributed to the objection of traditional Scientology scholars to using testimonies from current members. Both objections make unsupported, sweeping claims about reliability and detract from rigorous and nuanced academic analysis.",

The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: This presentation argues for the importance of identifying fraud and forgery as analytical categories for the study of religion when examining data from the ancient world into the contemporary period. It builds upon the foundational work of Arthur J. Droge, a scholar of Hebrew Bible/Old Testament, and Bart D. Ehrman, a New Testament scholar, both of whom wrote about fraud and forgery in the ancient world. The discussion then expands to include a wide range of religions throughout history, including several contemporary sects, cults, and/or \u0027new religions.\u0027\n\nWhile the focus of work on the ancient world is primarily on textual frauds and forgeries, a broader examination of religion encompasses fraudulent artifacts and both embellished and falsified religious credentials. Recent analyses of criminal acts emphasize the prevalence of religiously based affinity fraud. Many of these frauds and forgeries challenge the legitimacy and authority claims made by religious leaders and their followers, and some have had significant social, legal, and political impacts.\n\nMaryam Razavy will present a basic introduction to the topic of religious fraud, followed by a discussion of examples from major religious traditions. Stephen Kent will then extend the discussion to modern examples within sectarian groups. Phil Lord will conclude the presentation with a discussion of the legal treatment of religious fraud, highlighting several important cases.",

The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: Violent extremism is a growing worldwide problem that has received increased attention over the last twenty years, resulting in the advancement of knowledge on how people join, their involvement, and how they leave. An understudied area is people\u2019s experiences after they have left and are trying to reintegrate into mainstream society. Practitioners are often unequipped to assist in this transition, and tools are lacking to assess former extremists\u0027 psychosocial well-being and practical needs.\n\nKatharina Meredith, who studies violent extremism with Dr. John Horgan at Georgia State University, will present the findings of her Master\u2019s thesis on post-exit distress and coping. For the study, practitioners and former extremists were recruited for focus groups and interviews. A reflexive thematic analysis was used to summarize the topics and explore underlying themes. This resulted in an exploratory framework of post-exit distress and coping. Additionally, participants were invited back to provide feedback on the findings.\n\nThe post-exit distress framework includes dimensions such as mental health, emotions, physical health, daily life, legal matters, social relationships, exit and reintegration, safety, public image, identity, and worldview.\n\nThis exploratory study will lead to the development of a questionnaire and a follow-up study comparing former violent extremists and former cult members regarding post-exit distress and coping. Some of the themes found might already apply to former cult members, including \u0022feeling wired\u0022 (hypervigilance and the need to regulate stress levels after exiting), feeling disconnected from oneself and others, and the destabilizing nature of the initial years after leaving, characterized by internal and external chaos and uncertainty.",

The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: Ashlen Hilliard (she/her) will present her research conducted as part of the MSc Psychology of Coercive Control Program. Reproductive coercion interferes with an individual\u0027s rights and freedoms related to reproductive health decisions and decision-making to maintain power and control over the individual and prevent autonomy (Grace \u0026 Anderson, 2018). The accounts of those in cultic groups who experience a lack of reproductive autonomy are vital when reviewing existing definitions surrounding reproductive coercion. Existing understandings in the literature on reproductive coercion highlight that this particular form of coercion may be perpetrated by current or former intimate relationships, parents, or extended familial relationships (Grace \u0026 Anderson, 2018). However, in the context of those in cultic groups, the source of reproductive coercion may extend beyond an intimate relationship or family member. Potential sources of influence that may disrupt reproductive autonomy in cultic groups may include but are not limited to, the presence of a cult leader, cultural factors, or group ideological beliefs. Ashlen\u2019s research is the first exploratory analysis of the complex experiences of individuals who have experienced reproductive coercion while under the influence of a cultic or destructive group setting. Her research fills an identifiable gap in the literature by specifically studying how reproductive coercion manifests in destructive group settings, which has only been anecdotally alluded to from survivor accounts.",

The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: The lecture will start with a short review of previous lectures I gave about the nature of awe and the relationship between awe and the psychological state of fervor. What I didn\u0027t discuss previously is the counterintuitive subject of the causes of awe.\n\nThe most confusing aspect of awe experiences is that a person who experiences them can easily mistake what actually caused the experience with the conclusion that the person thinks the experience proves. For example, if a person sees a glass of water start to levitate, they might be filled with awe and conclude that a deity is sending them a message. What actually caused the awe experience is the levitating glass of water, but if you were to ask the person, they are likely to say that it was the presence of the deity that caused the glass to levitate, while the awe experience would just be seen as a side-effect.\n\nI will argue that awe comes about when people judge something as being sufficiently anomalous. Note that central to this claim is a person\u0027s judgment, meaning that there is nothing that is inherently awe-inspiring. It also means that almost anything can be thought of in a way that inspires awe. I will pay particular attention to the relationship between the causes and effects of awe and the sense of vastness (which is related to the vestibular sense, which has an interesting relationship with awe).\n\nBy understanding the causes of awe, we can see how people can be manipulated to feel awe, and more importantly, how cults can make sure that the potential recruit that they induce awe in comes to the \u0022correct\u0022 conclusion. After all, a levitating glass of water can psychologically \u0022prove\u0022 any faith.",

The speaker(s) of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: In recent years, the theory of identity fusion has been proposed to explain extreme behaviors conducted by people on behalf of a greater good, such as a group or a cause. This means that when individuals feel a sense of oneness with a group, they tend to prioritize the group\u0027s goals over their own well-being. Evidence has shown that strongly fused individuals are more likely to endorse extreme pro-group behaviors, such as being willing to fight for the group, volunteer for frontline combat, sacrifice their own lives, engage in morally questionable actions in support of the group, or accept violence in general. Researchers have explored the level of fusion individuals experience with various groups, including their country, sacred values, the military, their families, or political parties, among others. They have also studied how this fusion affects individuals\u0027 willingness to make costly sacrifices and engage in extreme behaviors in violent contexts, such as hooliganism and terrorism.\n\nInitially, it was hypothesized that abusive (or cultic) group members would have high levels of fusion. However, no empirical research to date has explored the role of this phenomenon in cults. The purpose of this study is to investigate how identity fusion with a group influences individuals not only to tolerate the abuse of other group members but also to have an inclination or willingness to perpetrate such abuse, particularly if they have previously been victims of it. To achieve this goal, we will compare how these phenomena manifest in both abusive and non-abusive religious groups. We expect to obtain results that help us better understand the violent dynamics that occur in cultic groups and may provide insights into whether it is necessary to implement certain strategies to reduce individuals\u0027 identity fusion in order to prevent group members from acting in ways that are unjust, illegal, or harmful to themselves or others.",

The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: It is widely reported by Brazilian media the recurrence of abuses perpetrated by alleged religious leaders against their followers. Unfortunately, many of the cases find obstacles in the legal process itself due to a lack of technical information from the magistrates involved. This serious problem, which is a new violence against victims of undue influence, would be easily circumvented if a specialized analysis were requested to assist judges in their decisions.\n\nWhile Brazilian attention focuses on victimology to explain the phenomenon, it is important to discuss the modus operandi of groups based on undue influence. These groups reproduce the social imaginary that the collective is always right, leading to the logical conclusion that any negative result is attributed to a single subject. However, culture is formed by a broad corpus that implies a habitus that can lead to absurdities. In other words, it is not possible for a single person to be responsible for a social phenomenon such as Bolsonarism.\n\nBringing this reflection to the logic of victimology in cults of undue influence, it is not the victim who should suffer socio-legal scrutiny, but the group that perpetrated the violence. This leads to one more issue: there is a support network for the abusive leader that needs to be addressed at the academic and legal level.\n\nThis talk aims to debate Brazilian cultural identity that favors the silencing of victims and protects criminals, highlighting laws concerning cases of undue influence in religious environments. This study is part of a post-doctoral research at the Federal University of Bahia. The methodological course involved a broad bibliographic review about undue influence in religious circles, as well as documentary analysis of judicial decisions and cases shared by the Public Ministry of five Brazilian states in which the investigated processes took place.",

The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: In recent years, scientific evidence has accumulated on the elements that characterize different forms of interpersonal violence that can occur in intense, continuous, close relationships. The purpose of this study was to examine the similarities that exist between violence perpetrated in abusive groups, intimate partner violence, and the sexual exploitation of children and adolescents. First, these forms of interpersonal violence involve a severe power imbalance between a victim who is usually in a situation of vulnerability and a perpetrator who holds some kind of authority. This power imbalance makes victims relatively unable to defend their own interests and feel increasingly powerless, helpless, and even more vulnerable. Second, the recurrence and duration of interactions over time are key elements to understand the phenomenon. Violence is perpetrated on a continuous and systematic basis, which allows the process to be gradually intensified and fosters the normalization of the abusive situation. Third, interpersonal violence involves the implementation of a wide range of psychological, sexual, and physical abuse strategies that directly impact the victims by affecting their emotions, cognitions, and behaviors, or indirectly by controlling their immediate environment. Scholars have identified several strategies that can be perpetrated against cult followers, women in couples, and sexually exploited minors alike, such as isolation, intimidation and threats, manipulation of guilt, or the redefinition of reality. Fourth, the primary goal of interpersonal violence in close relationships is to obtain submission and broad dominance over the lives of the victims, rather than to cause damage or simply obtain obedience to specific orders. For perpetrators, domination may produce satisfaction associated with the achievement of power, as well as other benefits related to the labor, economic, or sexual exploitation of the victims. A conceptual model that highlights the parallelisms between these forms of interpersonal violence may be useful to better understand the phenomenon.",

Miller\n -\nDisclaimer: This session was delivered for the 2023 ICSA Conference. The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: The focus of this proposed phenomenological study is to explore the lived experiences of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses (JW) students enrolled at secular higher education institutions and how the JW organization, along with its doctrines, impacts their collegiate experiences. A historical perspective of the JW organization, including its religious belief system, is presented to provide context for the proposed study. The study aims to answer three research questions: (1) What are the lived experiences of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses students who attend secular higher education institutions? (2) How do the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses organization and its doctrines impact the experiences of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses students attending secular higher education institutions? (3) How can educators help incorporate and support Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses students in secular higher education institutions?\n\nThe research questions will be addressed by conducting a series of three semi-structured interviews (Seidman, 2019) with five JW student participants who meet the sample criteria. Additionally, document analysis will be conducted on the JW organization\u0027s Watchtower Bible and Tract Society magazines and pamphlets, Awake and Watchtower. This proposed research study aims to contribute to the limited published research on JW students at secular higher education institutions and provide valuable insights for JW students making decisions about student services and programs. It also offers recommendations, strategies, and resources to educators and administrators seeking to support JW students.",

      "description": "Sexual Violence in Cultic Group Contexts: How Sexual Violence Is Perceived During and After Group Involvement - Marie-Andr\u00E9e Pelland, Celeste Goguen\n-\nDisclaimer: This session was delivered for the 2023 ICSA Conference. The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: Sexual violence is an experience of victimization shared by numerous North Americans. In the United States, one in five women and one in four men have been victims of attempted rape or rape during their lifetime (Smith et al., 2018). In a victimization survey, data shows that 81% of women and 43% of men recognize that they have experienced some form of sexual harassment and assault. In Canada, 39% of women and 35% of men have been sexually assaulted. Additionally, one in three (32%) women and one in eight (13%) men have experienced unwanted sexual behavior in public (Cotter and Savage, 2019). These statistics help us recognize that sexual violence is gender-based, and women are more likely than men to experience unwanted sexual violence in their lifetime. This can include diverse forms of sexual violence, from sexual harassment to sexual assault (Kelly, 1988).\n\nWhat is the situation of sexual violence in cultic contexts? Is this also a gender-based form of control? Is unwanted sexual behavior within a cultic group a reality as well? Can members freely give their sexual consent? How do members perceive behaviors that could be interpreted as sexual violence by outsiders? At what point in their trajectory does a former member recognize that what he or she experienced can be described as sexual violence?\n\nTo address these questions, we will analyze qualitative data from two sources: interviews and biographies. We will analyze thirty interviews with members and former members from various North American groups to comprehend their understanding of sexual violence within their community and their own experiences. To further our understanding, we will include former members\u0027 biographies, where they identified themselves as victims of sexual violence. Our results will aim to understand how sexual violence can be defined as a form of control over women\u0027s bodies.",

      "description": "Cultic Tendencies Within Denominational Churches: A Case Study of the Church of England - Stephen Parsons\n-\nDisclaimer: This session was delivered for the 2023 ICSA Conference. The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: This talk will explore three ways in which certain cultic strands have started to appear within a denominational church, the Church of England, in recent years. As a summary, I will give each of these three named cultic tendencies a two-word description - Binary Thinking, Narcissistic Exchange, and Artificial Community.\n\n1. Binary Thinking: Parts of the Church of England have increasingly aligned themselves with fundamentalist/binary ways of thinking. This black-white fundamentalist universe does not encourage imagination, wonder, or a sense of mystery. As a result, many CofE members are now deprived of spiritual creativity and the opportunity to deal with ambiguity and doubt.\n\n2. Narcissistic Exchange: There is an increasing tendency for CofE Christians to flock to large churches that require them to identify with and pour adulation on charismatic leaders. These leaders create a sense of power and excitement around them. On closer examination, we find a narcissistic bond between leaders and followers. This narcissistic feeding works in two directions. Leaders are encouraged in their grandiosity by uncritical worship of their charisma, while those who follow are fed with reassuring sermons about their salvation. However, there is little face-to-face pastoral support, and this narcissistic interdependency is ultimately unhealthy and sterile.\n\n3. Artificial Community: The need to belong is a strong motivation for people coming together. The community life offered by many \u0022successful\u0022 churches is strong on providing a sense of security and comfort but weak in addressing the true demands of maturity. Maturity encompasses conflict resolution and learning to live in a way that embraces differences.\n\nThe paper will conclude with a visual examination of church websites that illustrate each of these cultic tendencies.",

The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nThe resurgence of the cult of Simon Magus has found footing in the form of \u0022Deliverance Ministries\u0022 across the country, but particularly in the Appalachian mountain areas. These groups intertwine pseudo-psychiatric treatments popular in the 1970s, such as Neuro-Linguistic Programming and hypnotherapy, with existing treatments for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Practitioners claim that these treatments exorcise demonic presences in the lives of their clients. The overlay of Christian-based loaded language, combined with the popularity of current theological movements like the charismatic movement, helps fuel and create an environment for these practitioners to attempt to practice medicine without a license and prey upon victims of religious trauma who are seeking healing in those same charismatic Christian environments.\n\nThis paper will explore the forensic theological history of deliverance movements, their predominance in Appalachian mountain culture, their usage of manipulative psychotherapy frameworks disguised as punctuated exorcisms, an analysis of the clinical outcomes for individuals caught in the lucrative financial engine that these groups have designed, and recommendations for treatment and best practices for practitioners who are treating victims of these groups.",

These restrictions, however, have been progressively modified over the past twenty years. In this presentation, we will discuss the ways in which this group adapted during the COVID-19 pandemic, including how their stance toward modern technology underwent further alteration. Using qualitative data from first-hand accounts, we will look at how the PBCC was able to maintain many of their practices despite the significant alterations required to meet government requirements and how this was experienced by the members. We will also examine ways in which the PBCC is not only embracing the technologies they once avoided but is increasingly utilizing them as a means to further their separation from wider society.",

      "description": "Describing and Understanding Women\u0027s Experiences in Cultic Groups - Andrea Lagorse\n-\nDisclaimer: This session was delivered for the 2023 ICSA Conference. The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nThis talk will present the results of my master\u0027s thesis, which focuses on the specific experiences of women in a cultic context. Only a few studies have been carried out on this subject. Nevertheless, it seems that the cultic context provides an opportunity for leaders and the groups they have created to use psychological and sexual violence against women. Violence, gender inequalities, power relations, and stigmatization that women have suffered for decades in society are found in cultic contexts. These groups often maintain a patriarchal system that views women as inferior to men. It, therefore, seems relevant to look at women\u0027s experiences in cultic groups, especially in the Canadian social context, where women\u0027s rights are a central concern.\n\nThe main objective of this thesis was to identify the experiences of girls and women in cultic groups, with an emphasis on experiences of victimization, if applicable, based on the testimony of former members of such groups.\n\nUsing a qualitative methodology, eight in-depth life-story interviews were conducted with female former cult members. The participants\u0027 testimonies were analyzed from a feminist perspective, based on Stark\u0027s (2007) theory of coercive control.\n\nThe presented results show that women are subject to coercive control by the leader, which is reinforced by other members and sometimes by family members involved in the group. Participants are locked into roles that often stem from a patriarchal vision of women\u0027s place in society, forcing them to respond to the requirements of the leader and the community to whicxh they belong. Women also encounter difficulties when they leave the group, particularly in relation to seeking formal help. Considering the collected data, there is a real need for awareness, training, and research on understanding the specific cultic experiences of women to help them while respecting what they have experienced.",

      "description": "The Anti-Cult Movement in Russia - Dan Phillips, Tommy Valentine\n-\nDisclaimer: This session was delivered for the 2023 ICSA Conference. The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: \u0022Anti-cult\u0022 groups began to form in the 1970s in the United States in response to the perceived destructive nature of various new religious movements (NRM) (also known pejoratively as \u0022cults\u0022) that flourished in the 1960s. Parents, family members, and professionals of cults/NRM have since debated how cults/NRM should be viewed by society. Some have seen cults/NRM as destructive, and their members in need of saving through the use of techniques such as \u0022deprogramming.\u0022 However, there have been others who view the countermovement anti-cult groups as more destructive than those in the NRM themselves.\n\nSince the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, various parties in Russia have fought for legislation to ban religious groups that are seen as dangerous. The Russians have enacted legislation to prohibit various religious groups, such as the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, who were banned from Russia in 2017. Alexander Dvorkin has been on the frontline in the anti-cult movement in Russia. He is concerned that there exist destructive cults in Russia that attempt to control every aspect of their members\u0027 lives. Dvorkin wants individuals to have rights stronger than the rights of specific religious groups.\n\nThis presentation examines the post-Soviet anti-cult movement, the philosophy behind it, along with the major individuals and groups who are driving the anti-cult agenda. The Russian Orthodox Church, for instance, has supported the anti-cult movement, but there are other factors involved, not the least of which is Putin\u0027s desire to have the population united by one religion. Finally, Russia\u0027s anti-cult movement will be examined in the context of the Western anti-cult movement that occurred in the 1970s and 1980s in the United States.",

      "description": "You Should Write a Memoir! - Nori Muster\n-\nDisclaimer: This session was delivered for the 2023 ICSA Conference. The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: In 1997, Nori Muster published \u0022Betrayal of the Spirit,\u0022 a memoir about her ten years with the Hare Krishnas. For most of those years, she participated in covering up the organization\u0027s secrets. When she realized what was going on, she signed up for the UCLA Extension Writer\u0027s Program to learn how to tell the story. By the time she left the temple, she had a five-hundred-page doorstop of a manuscript. The final book was 213 pages.\n\nNori has been writing for publication since 1981 and will share what she\u0027s learned. The subjects include: how to decide what story you want to tell, what to include or leave out, the importance of your working title, how to obey slander and libel laws, where to seek feedback, when not to talk about your work, how to manage writer\u0027s block, whether to join a writing group or class, whether to publish, whether to self-publish, how to self-publish, how to write a memoir for future generations of your family, whether to use a pseudonym, how to choose a title, how to write a book proposal, and how to work with an agent or publisher.\n\nNori will present the information first and then open a group discussion. If you have ideas for writing a memoir or you\u0027re already in the process, this workshop will address your concerns. This workshop is designed to be inspirational, to help you get past the obstacles and on the road.\n\nYour goal may or may not include publishing, but simply putting your memories on paper is therapeutic because it helps get them out of your head. Reading and editing what you write helps you process your experiences. After the discussion, Nori will lead a writing exercise to brainstorm a title for your memoir.",

The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: My presentation will be about the troubled teen industry and its use of coercive control and thought reform as a form of \u0022treatment\u0022. This industry, which is mostly unregulated and unlicensed, manipulates desperate parents into thinking they will save children who are struggling with serious issues, including but not limited to trauma, neglect, learning disabilities, and severe mental health diagnoses. This industry utilizes coercive control and meets the same criteria as thought reform groups developed by Robert Jay Lifton. The aftermath for these children is devastating. Mental health professionals are often not trained in how to treat the survivors of this industry, and they just do not seem to fit in anywhere among survivor communities, or in the worst case, they unknowingly send clients to these programs for \u0022treatment\u0022. However, there is growing awareness through advocacy groups, and I\u0027d like to educate the cult community on how these survivors fit into the cult community and give them a voice and a place to belong. As a survivor of this industry and a mental health professional who is very passionate about working with cult survivors, I am excited to present this issue to my colleagues at the International Conference.",

Domestic abuse is now recognized as a widespread social problem   It is estimated that nearly half of all women and men will experience interpersonal aggression in a familial context during their lifetimes. This talk will suggest a connection between the power dynamic of domestic abuse, or as it is now often called, interpersonal violence, and the dynamic of coercive control in cultic groups.  I will present an overview of the stages and defining characteristics of coercive relationships, common to both domestic violence and cults. The talk will focus on Albert Biderman\u0027s eight coercive methods for eliciting compliance, including threats, degradation, trauma bonding, and isolation and how they manifest in both cults and domestic violence. Education to recognize and understand relationships of dominance and subjugation is the first line of defense against interpersonal violence of all types.",

      "description": "Generation Cult: Using New Media to Share Your Story (Dhyana Levey)\n\nPresentation at the International Cultic Studies Association annual conference in Manchester, UK in 2019. The public loves a good story and is especially interested in true tales about cults. Unfortunately, there\u2019s a lot of inaccurate information floating around about these high-demand, authoritarian groups. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for people who have had personal experiences with a variety of cults to share their stories. So, how does someone do that? Traditionally, writers have published books. Some are lucky enough to get a legitimate publisher, but that can be difficult, even more so now as that publishing industry has been in decline. But there are many other options now for people to share their stories. The internet and social media have become a very effective way to share information about cults, from online support groups to personal blogs to a simple confession on Facebook shared with your friends. Podcasts are an excellent way to learn about cults. There\u2019s one just called \u201CCults,\u201D another called \u201CWe\u2019re Starting a Cult,\u201D podcasts that just focus on a single cult like \u201CHeaven\u2019s Gate\u201D and then there\u2019s my own called \u201CGeneration Cult,\u201D that discusses people raised in high-demand groups. At first I thought traditional publishing was the only way to get my message to the public, but I learned how to make my own podcast and it wasn\u2019t that hard. Other people can do it, too. There are plenty of creative options out there now for former cult members to use to share their stories, they just have to know how to use them.",

      "description": "Developing the \u2018Totalistic Identity Theory\u2019 for cults and extremist groups\n(Rod Dubrow-Marshall, Ph.D.)\n\nResearch previously presented (Dubrow-Marshall and Martin 2008) has articulated the \u2018Totalistic Identity Theory\u2019 for cultic and extremist groups whereby it is advanced that members identity structures are largely dominated and fixed on the cult identity at the expense of many or all other levels and categories of identity and in a polarized or differentiated position in relation to other groups and society at large. This theory (Dubrow-Marshall 2007) is an extension of traditional social psychological theory on group identity (e.g. Turner\u2019s (1987) Self-Categorization Theory). Analysis of former cult members from the Wellspring Retreat and Resource Center in Ohio (Dubrow-Marshall \u0026 Martin 2008) has also shown a clear relationship between aspects of psychopathology and extent of identity with the group, thus providing evidence that a totalistic or polarized identity structure is harmful for group members.\nThis paper presents further analysis from the Wellspring sample advancing further a model for the specific psychopathology of former cult members. This analysis points to additional evidence for the \u2018Totalistic Identity Theory\u2019 and in particular aspects relating to the polarized identity position and its relationship to overall psychological well being and the perception by current group members of non-group members and the rest of the world and the behavioural correlates of such perceptions. The theory also points to and supports strategies for depolarization and de-identification with extremist groups and approaches to preventing initial recruitment to them.",

      "description": "Religious Conflict Resolution (Michael Langone, PhD.) \n\nResearch suggests that, in the West, hundreds of thousands of individuals join and leave\ncultic groups each year. Research studies also suggest that at least a sizable minority of\nthose who join cultic groups are adversely affected. The families of these group members,\nand probably many other families, tend to become concerned about their loved one\u2018s group\ninvolvement.\nRoughly 80 percent of the groups that cause concern are religious. The psychological,\npolitical, and occasionally commercial groups that aren\u2018t overtly religious often influence\nmembers\u2018 lives as though they were religions because they typically bring about a major\nshift in members\u2018 views of self, world, and other\u2014i.e., a conversion experience.\nDuring the past 25 years, most professionals who work with these families have emphasized\nhelping them persuade their loved ones to leave cultic groups. Exit counseling, a process\naimed at helping families create conditions under which their loved one will reevaluate a\ngroup involvement, has been very valuable to thousands of grateful families and group\nmembers. (Exit counseling is also often referred to as \u2015thought reform consultation.\u2016)\n\nNevertheless, only a very small percentage of families are able to proceed to an exit-\ncounseling intervention. In many cases, an intervention is not possible or even appropriate\n\nbecause the loved one\u2018s relationship to a group does not fit the typical pattern of\nexploitative manipulation associated with the subjects of exit-counseling interventions, even\nthough the family may have valid concerns. In other cases, the loved one may be so\nattached to the group (e.g., because of family ties within the group, decades of\ncommitment, fear of adjusting to the mainstream world) that his or her departure is\nunlikely, even with an intervention.\nVery little attention has been paid to this large majority of families for whom an exit\ncounseling is not feasible or appropriate. Livia Bardin\u2018s book, Coping with Cult Involvement:\nA Handbook for Families and Friends, offers some guidance. Ms. Bardin says that a cult\ninvolvement is often \u2015a situation to manage, not a problem to solve.\u2016\nThis talk will explore ways in which families can more effectively \u2015manage\u2016 a loved one\u2018s\ninvolvement in a group that causes concern, at least in part because of the nature of the\nconversion that it tends to bring about. The talk will approach the situation as a family\nconflict over what at least overtly are religious issues. Through lecture and discussion, the\nspeakers, a counseling psychologist, an educational/organizational consultant, and an exit\ncounselor (thought-reform consultant), will examine\n- How families and group members can come to better understand and appreciate\neach other\u2018s perspectives on the conflict that divides them.\n- How they can improve communication so as to reduce the level of conflict.\n- How they can negotiate mutual behavioral changes that will reduce the level of\nconflict.\n- How they can come to terms with the need to compromise so as to protect the love\nbetween them while respecting differences that divide them.",

      "description": "Reawakening Your Spirituality After a Cult Experience\n(Doug and Wendy Duncan)\n\nPresentation at the International Cultic Studies Association annual conference in Philadelphia, PA in 2018. Spiritual abuse is widespread and can be found in all religions. Cultic/spiritual abuse occurs when leaders use their position of authority to manipulate, control, and dominate. The cult leader portrays himself as the truth-bearer and members are led to believe that God has specifically chosen him to bring light into the world. The cult leader\u2019s claim that God has given him a unique and special revelation justifies his role as the leader and his right to exercise control over his members. Followers are taught to accept the leader\u2019s authority as divinely mandated. In whatever manner the abusive leader uses God, karma, salvation, the threat of damnation, the promise of enlightenment, or other spiritual promises/threats, the result is the same: spiritual abuse. Any doubts or questions are quickly extinguished by the leader utilizing intimidation, humiliation, and fear. Over time, the devotee adopts the cult\u2019s view of God and has difficulty leaving because of the fear that doing so means they are leaving \u201CThe Truth\u201D and even God himself. When an individual manages to separate from a cultic or spiritually abusive group, he faces myriad issues of a physical and psychological nature. Defining and reclaiming post-cult spirituality is often postponed while the individual sorts through day-to-day life outside the cult. However, acknowledging the damage and recapturing one\u2019s spiritual identity is a core task of recovery. How can we reawaken our spirituality? How do we fill that emptiness of the soul? How do we get past the feelings of confusion and disillusionment? How do we recapture a sense of purpose? This presentation will focus on:\n \nObstacles in transitioning out of a spiritually manipulative group/religion \nExpunging the image of the god of the cult \nRecovering your faith \nReconnecting with your spiritual self\u201D",

The speaker believes, in general, that dealing with conflicting viewpoints can be a healthy phenomenon. Dialogue expands our reality by helping us gain new insight into others as well as ourselves. In this presentation, the speaker will consider some factors that undermine ICSA\u2019s goal for dialogue among diverse groups and will suggest some ideas that might help members to connect. To understand the undermining factors, the speaker will focus upon the concept of transference and, also, upon the human tendency to stereotype those from groups that are different from their own. The speaker suggests that we should not let our expectation of others shape our reality. It is only possible to hear and learn from one another if there is a willingness to move past our assumptions. It helps to keep in mind the need to be humble, remembering that all are equals deserving of respect.",

This panel will attempt to cast a more realistic light on some of the less positive elements within the religion of Buddhism, which as a whole still tends to enjoy an unblemished, \u0022warm and fuzzy\u0022 standing in the public imagination. \n\n1. Ready to Mine: Zen\u2019s Legitimating Mythology and Cultish Behavior. Long-time practitioner and outspoken critic of Zen Buddhism Stuart Lachs will show how Zen\u0027s legitimating story and mythic history lays the groundwork for authoritarian-inclined charismatic leaders \u2012 called \u0022Zen masters\u0022 or roshi \u2012 to draw their followers into a world based on unquestioning obedience to the master, reliance on his approval, and an ethical framework dependent on his self-serving understanding. Though Zen presents its idealized masters as being fully in the world, spontaneous, and \u2012 most importantly \u2012 \u0022unattached\u0022, a state in which they are internally firm and free while remaining perceptually competent, this has hardly been the case in reality. Stuart will accordingly provide a number of examples of Asian and Western Zen masters who, along with their followers, have displayed cult-like behavior. Link to blog: https://buddhism-controversy-blog.com/2017/07/16/ready-to-mine-zens-legitimating-mythology-and-cultish-behavior/  \n\n2. Tibetan Buddhist monk Tenzin Peljor will explain how doctrinal issues and cross-cultural misunderstandings, for example about the concepts of faith and the guru in Tibetan Buddhism, can contribute to abusive spiritual systems. His review will begin with the highly controversial \u0022New Kadampa Tradition\u0022 and his own experiences with that movement, and then expand to other groups. Having run an online information portal about controversial Buddhist groups for many years, Tenzin can draw on numerous examples of suspect behavior from across the broad Buddhist spectrum. Link to PowerPoint: https://tenzinpeljor.de/PDF/ICSA2017.pdf \n\n3. How Zen Groups Respond to Allegations of Abuse. Zen teacher Christopher Hamacher will compare various Zen Buddhist groups from the perspective of how they have responded to abuse by their teachers. Based on a number of recent scandals, he will demonstrate how various Buddhist doctrines are invoked by the leaders and students, firstly to deny the abuse and/or refuse to intervene, and afterwards to deal \u0022compassionately\u0022 \u2012 i.e ineffectively \u2012 with the abuser. Christopher will then propose that, ultimately, the way a group reacts to allegations of misconduct may be a better indicator of its underlying dysfunction than the content of the allegations themselves.",

      "description": "Spiritual Issues in Counseling (Rev. Robert Pardon; Judy Pardon)\n2017\n\nSome apply the term spiritual abuse to any kind of psychological, physical, or sexual abuse that takes place in a religious context.  Others apply the term specifically to manipulations that damage a person\u0027s relationship to God or to his/her core self. Spiritual abuse has been reported in mainstream religious organizations as well as nonmainstream groups, such as cults.\n\nThe terms psychological abuse or emotional abuse refer to harms that overlap those associated with both of these conceptualizations of spiritual abuse. These harms include but are not limited to damaged self-esteem, induced dependency, impaired capacity to trust oneself or others, and emotional reactions such as anger, anxiety, and depression. In some cases, one\u0027s faith in God may also be shaken.\n\nTo a large degree, the choice of a term, psychological abuse or spiritual abuse, depends upon the framework (psychological or religious) with which the speaker/writer feels comfortable. This two-day conference finds value in resources coming from psychological and religious frameworks, though obviously some issues, e.g., questions about God\u0027s mercy, may require religious concepts to address properly. The conference is aimed at those who were spiritually abused, whether recently or in the past, family members concerned about a loved one, and helping professionals, including pastors and therapists.\n\nThe agenda will include the following topics:\n\nThe varieties of abuse\nCoping with triggers\nPersonal accounts of spiritual abuse\nPsychological issues in counseling\nSpiritual issues in counseling\nHow can churches and synagogues become spiritual safe havens\nSpiritual abuse victims dialogue with religious and mental health professionals\nOpen discussion",

These expectations carry severe consequences when not adhered to. While some groups suppress erotic development, others foster indiscriminate sexual activity creating an atmosphere that is inappropriately sexually charged and overstimulating. Anxiety surrounding sexuality may result in the sexual self becoming alienated. Messages instilled by the cult leader or belief system may continue in a person\u2019s psyche and body after a former member throws off the constricting cult norms and seeks to explore their own sexual potential. Learning to cope with these messages is necessary to be able to engage in healthy relationships. \n\nInsecure attachments characteristic of families in cults well as messages instilled by the cult often contribute to biological sexual dysfunction.

Each presentation will serve as a stimulus for questions and a discussion of clinical issues, which will occur during the following hour.\n\nDr Gillie Jenkinson will discuss the rationale for being informed by the Phases of Recovery and Growth when working with former cult members.

Individuals raised in cults may have never received appropriate medical care and may have many misconceptions about illness, doctors and medicine. This talk will explore how two second generation adult (SGA) former cult members overcame those barriers. You will hear from one SGA who become his own medical advocate and was able to form healing, therapeutic relationships with his medical team and doctors. The other speaker is an SGA who went to medical school after exiting the cult and has been a practicing family physician for 20 years. She will explore the issue from both perspectives and will specifically address stigmas attached to mental illness and psychiatric medicines.\n\nEva Mackey Meyrat, MD, is a second-generation adult former cult member and a facilitator of the ICSA CT Workshop for Those Born or Raised in Cultic Groups. Her mother became a devotee of an Indian guru in 1975 when she was one year old. He taught a branch of Hinduism called Advaita Vedanta, a non-dualistic philosophy which teaches that the self is one with the ultimate truth or reality. Half of Eva\u2019s childhood was spent in the ashram in India, where she and the other children were unsupervised much of the time. Despite the upheavals and instability that characterized her childhood, Eva managed to get out of the cult at the age of 16 and eventually earned her MD degree from the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. Dr. Mackey has a busy family practice, and she lives near Dallas with her husband and four children.\n\nCk Rardin, facilitator, ICSA CT Workshop for Those Born or Raised in Cultic Groups, was born in California. His parents raised him in a cultic Catholic group and when he reached adolescence, they signed over their parental rights to the group. Ck was then sent to the cult\u2019s headquarters in Itaquera, Sao Paulo, Brazil. He stayed in the group till age 26 when he gathered the courage and strength to leave the organization on his own. After leaving he became a certified EMT, then was certified and joined the American Society of Clinical Pathologists (ASCP ), with which he maintains his certification. He now runs his own IT consulting firm in upstate New York and spends much of his time involved in recovery from his experience, working to expose these groups (for example, assisting in research for MTV\u2019s production of The Cult Question) as well as helping others in their recovery.",

After they leave the cult, they may bring these beliefs and character traits with them. S/MGAs can discover that attitudes shaped within the cult might be impeding their present life. For example, in the cult, they were expected to reach perfection. This belief causes them to struggle with internalized pressure to be perfect after they leave. When S/MGAs fail at perfection, they typically might feel depressed or filled with shame. S/MGAs also might experience symptoms of C-PTSD, such as hypervigilant or hypovigilent (dissociative) behavior. Additionally, S/MGAs typically struggle with complicated emotions about their parents in the cult, and they might be uncertain about how to deal with their feelings after they leave the cult. Finally, the presenters will explore how post-cult relationships and therapy might aid former cult members.\n\nLorna Goldberg, LCSW, PsyA, Board Member and Past President of ICSA, is a clinical social worker and psychoanalyst in private practice and Director at the Institute of Psychoanalytic Studies. In 1976, she and her husband, William Goldberg, began facilitating a support group for former cult members that continues to meet monthly in their home in Englewood, New Jersey. She has cochaired ICSA\u2019s Mental Health Committee, published numerous articles in professional journals about her therapeutic work with former cult members, and contributed chapters to several important texts on psychotherapy and cults. Most recently Lorna coedited (along with William Goldberg, Rosanne Henry, and Michael Langone) Cult Recovery: A Clinician\u2019s Guide to Working With Former Members and Families (2017).

Lesbian and gay individuals who grow up in religious cults can face opposition and condemnation based on the individual\u2019s affectional/sexual orientation. This opposition may come from religious doctrines and teachings, cult/church leaders, and even from family members. As a result of this opposition and condemnation, LGB individuals may struggle with depression, anxiety, drug/alcohol abuse, self-mutilation, and suicidal ideation. The researcher will describe the lived experiences of LGB individuals who grew up in fundamental religious organizations/cults that have subsequently left these groups and discuss best counseling practices to work with these individuals, based on experience and research.\n \nAfter this session participants will be able to:\n1. Participants will gain an understanding of the collective experiences of former cult members who identify as LGB\n2.

This is not a \u201Cfun\u201D book. Nor is it a book that aims to validate feelings of anger, hurt, helplessness, and fear, although it does that to some extent. This book is a handbook, a tool designed to help you achieve a goal, namely, to help a loved one. As with all tools, the book requires effort to learn how to use it. It is not something that you merely read. It is something that you use, something that you wrestle with, that you come back to again and again.\n\nIf you are willing to give the requisite time and mental exertion that this book demands, I am confident that you will find it to be extremely helpful. It may not solveyour problem, for, as Mrs. Bardin states in the Introduction, a cult involvement is often a situation to manage, not a problem to solve. The book will, however, make you confident that you are doing all that you realistically can to manage, if not solve, the problem that has caused you so much distress.\n\nAbout the Author:\nLivia Bardin, MSW, is a clinical social worker who has been engaged with cult victims and their families for more than fifteen years. She is particularly interested in the interface between high-demand groups and cults and mainstream society. Her research in this area has been published in the Cultic Studies Review and the Journal of Public Child Welfare. Now retired, Ms. Bardin has provided training on cult-related issues for mental health professionals in the Washington area and elsewhere, She is the author of Coping with Cult Involvement: A Handbook for Families and Friends of cult members. In 2014 Ms. Bardin received ICSA\u0027s Margaret T. Singer Award.",

Each month will feature a different clinician discussing some aspect of clinical work. Each presentation will serve as a stimulus for questions and a discussion of clinical issues, which will occur during the following hour.\n\nDaniel Shaw LCSW will discuss his clinical approach to working with cult survivors. His approach is based on more than 25 years of experience as a psychoanalyst, and on his own experience of 13 years living and working in the ashram of a guru he came to see as a cult leader. He will discuss the importance of psycho-education, about the psychology of the cult leader, and about the effects on survivors of trauma. His approach emphasizes the importance of self-compassion, the antidote to self-alienation, through the use of self-reflection and self-regulation skills.\n\nAfter completing this webinar, participants will be able to:\n1. Define self-alienation and identify the symptoms of self-alienation in cult survivors. \n2. Identify the psychopathology of the traumatizing narcissist, including their specific abusive behaviors that negatively impact the functioning of cult survivors.\n3. Educate cult-survivor clients to develop self-reflection and affect regulation skills in their process of trauma recovery. \n\nBibliography:\nBenjamin, J. (1998).

This talk will focus on how unhealthy Christian churches may cultivate an environment for spiritual abuse to thrive, the role controlling theology can play in creating a high-pressure environment, and conclude with questions you can raise about a group to help evaluate spiritual abuse, the potential for it, or if high-control scenarios already exist. Understanding my experience was essential for my recovery to begin! The context for this discussion will pull from reflections of being a born and raised former member of a fundamentalist Christian sect.\n\nOverview of series:\nThis series is specifically for second and multi-generational adult former cult members, however, this is going to be the first program for S/MGAs that is open to all. In the past, ICSA workshops for this population have been limited to those who were themselves born or raised in cults. But we see the increasing need for those outside of this population to learn about the unique recovery issues relevant to S/MGAs.\n\nPresenter Bio:\nAshlen Hilliard is the Director of Events for the International Cultic Studies Association (ICSA). Before ICSA, she worked as a case manager in Salt Lake City, Utah that helped individuals leaving polygamy out west. Ashlen relocated to Portland, Oregon in 2020 where she is involved in local Spiritual Abuse Forum for Education (SAFE) Meetups for survivors of cultic and spiritual abuse. Ashlen facilitates support groups and meetings online for former members of cultic groups. \n\nHer current focuses with ICSA are event organization and former member outreach. Ashlen has also presented at multiple ICSA conferences, and continues moderating online conference and webinar programs. She has been interviewed on cults on NPR One Podcast Series with FGCU and The Tennessee Holler. She has published an article in ICSA Today 10.2 / 2019 on, The Genesis, Text, and Implications of Utah House Bill 214: Office for Victims of Crime Amendments.\n\nShe is currently pursuing her Masters in the Psychology of Coercive Control through the University of Salford.",

Children will dissociate from their emotional reactions to abuse or neglect in an attempt to protect themselves and survive in the face of overwhelming anxiety. Dissociation allows them to continue to rely on a frightening or abandoning adult. Children defend themselves further by identifying with their perpetrator\u0027s attitude. The cult leader or parent reinforces this attitude by creating a punitive and shaming world for the child. Living in such a harsh reality has numerous ramifications for the character of SGA/MGAs. SGA/MGAs continue to struggle with their harsh conscience after they leave the cult. To help, therapists can provide a compassionate and respectful environment where former cult members gain a broader sense of reality by connecting the present to the past. \n\nOverview of series:\nThis series is specifically for second and multi-generational adult former cult members, however, this is going to be the first program for S/MGAs that is open to all. In the past, ICSA workshops for this population have been limited to those who were themselves born or raised in cults. But we see the increasing need for those outside of this population to learn about the unique recovery issues relevant to S/MGAs.\n\nPresenter Bios:\nHeather Zweiback spent 8 years of her early childhood in a bible-based group.

Viewers will learn the difference between healthy and unhealthy attachment patterns. The cult involved parent is likely to display unhealthy attachment patterns which will negatively impact the child. Erickson\u2019s eight developmental stages will be reviewed with an emphasis on how they may not be successfully complete by children in cults. Children develop survival strategies in response the unhealthy caregiver and environment. These strategies, while necessary for the child, may create problems as the child grows into an adult. These problems include but are not limited to the following: Problems with the development of a unique identity and sense of self. 2. Trouble with affect regulation and inability to self-soothe. Those who were raised in cults often struggle with anxiety and depression. 3. Trouble with setting and maintaining healthy boundaries. 4.

Her mother became a devotee of an Indian guru in 1975 when she was 1 year old. He taught a branch of Hinduism called Advaita Vedanta; a non-dualistic philosophy which teaches that the self is one with the ultimate truth or reality. Half of Eva\u2019s childhood was spent in the ashram in India, where she and the other children were unsupervised much of the time. Despite the upheavals and instability that characterized her childhood, Eva managed to get out of the cult at the age of 16 and eventually earned her MD degree from the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. Dr. Mackey has a busy family practice, and she lives near Dallas with her husband and four children.",

Regardless of the primary focus of a particular cult (e.g. religious, political, therapeutic, philosophical, etc.) practically everyone who has been in one experienced feelings and reactions that were common to most cult encounters. These reactions and experiences were the predictable results of the group dynamics and manipulations common to all cults, even though their cult may have offered a self-serving mystical or magical explanation for them. For the initial presentation in this recovery workshop, the presenter will describe some common experiences of second-and multi-generation cult members (SGA\u0027s/MGA\u0027s). The goal of this presentation is to help the participants to define and describe these experiences as well as to consider non-mystical explanations for them.\n\nOverview of series:\nThis series is specifically for second and multi-generational adult former cult members, however, this is going to be the first program for S/MGAs that is open to all.

Carli McConkey was 21 years old when she happened upon New Age guru, Natasha Lakaev, and her personal development company, Life Integration Programmes, at the Mind Body Spirit Festival in Sydney, Australia in 1996. What at first appeared professional and promising, became a vehicle for psychological and physical abuse. Over the next thirteen years, Carli lost her freedom\u2026her mind\u2026and her family. This memoir demonstrates the subtle and insidious process of mind control, gives insights into the period of recovery after escape, and shows how determination and strength can overcome adversity.\u0022 You can purchase her book here: https://www.amazon.com/Cult-Effect-Story-Control-Australia-ebook/dp/B074DFJ3BH#:~:text=The%20Cult%20Effect%20is%20an,absolutely%20never%20signed%20up%20for.\n \nAbout the Author\n\u0022Carli McConkey spent over 13 years in a destructive cult from the age of 21 to 35 and escaped in January, 2010. She says \u0027escape\u0027, because she was brainwashed into believing that she could not leave. If she did, either her three children would be taken from her, or she and her family would die in Armageddon, prophesised by the cult leader for December 2012. Carli is a normal, everyday person, who is intelligent and from a loving family, and yet she found herself in this situation. Carli wishes to help educate family and friends of current and former cult members so that they are better able to understand the process of mind control and support their loved ones through recovery. She also hopes that sharing her story, personal insights and triumphs, will help support fellow ex-cult members and prevent others from falling prey to such predators. Carli completed a BA (Communication), majoring in Organisational Communication and Public Relations, at Charles Sturt University, Bathurst, in 1995. She has been rebuilding her career since leaving the cult, working as an Executive Assistant. Carli lives in Sydney with her three children.\u0022",

Muster joined the International Society of Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON)--the Hare Krishnas--in 1978, shortly after the death of the movement\u0027s spiritual master, and worked for ten years as a public relations secretary and editor of the organization\u0027s newspaper, the ISKCON World Review. In this candid and critical account, Muster follows the inner workings of the movement and the Hare Krishnas\u0027 progressive decline.\nCombining personal reminiscences, published articles, and internal documents, Betrayal of the Spirit details the scandals that beset the Krishnas--drug dealing, weapons stockpiling, deceptive fundraising, child abuse, and murder within ISKCON\u2013as well as the dynamics of schisms that forced some 95 percent of the group\u0027s original members to leave. In the midst of this institutional disarray, Muster continued her personal search for truth and religious meaning as an ISKCON member until, disillusioned at last with the movement\u0027s internal divisions, she quit her job and left the organization.\n\nIn a new preface to the paperback edition, Muster discusses the personal circumstances that led her to ISKCON and kept her there as the movement\u0027s image worsened. She also talks about \u0022the darkest secret\u0022\u2013child abuse in the ISKCON parochial schools--that was covered up by the public relations office where she worked. \nhttps://www.amazon.com/Betrayal-Spirit-Headlines-Krishna-Movement/dp/0252065662\n\nAbout Nori:\nNori Muster is a journalist, researcher, and artist based in Arizona. She earned her Master of Science degree at Western Oregon University studying creative art therapy. She started writing full time for publication in 1981, and published Betrayal of the Spirit, a memoir, in 1997.\nNori has written two follow-up books, Child of the Cult and Cult Survivor\u0027s Handbook. She writes journal articles on the subject, is a spokesperson to the media, and a regular presenter at International Cultic Studies Association (ICSA) conferences.\n\nNori wrote her own I Ching (Learning to Flow with the Dao), and her own positive thinking book (Dreaming Peace), for people in the post-9/11 world.

It focuses on how charismatic, authoritarian leaders control their followers\u2019 attachment relationships via manipulative social structures and ideologies so that, emotionally and cognitively isolated, they become unable to act in their own survival interests. Using the evolutionary theory of attachment to demonstrate the psychological impact of these environments, and incorporating the latest neuroscientific findings, Stein illustrates how the combined dynamic of terror and \u2018love\u2019 works to break down people\u2019s ability to think and behave rationally. From small local cults to global players like ISIS and North Korea, the impact of these movements is widespread and growing.\n \nThis important book offers clarity and a unique perspective on the dynamics of these systems of control, and concludes with guidance to foster greater awareness and prevention. It will be essential reading for mental health professionals in the field, as well as policy makers, legal professionals, cult survivors, and their families, as well as anyone with an interest in these disturbing groups. Students of social and developmental psychology will also find it fascinating.\u0022\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Terror-Love-Brainwashing-Attachment-Totalitarian/dp/1138677973",

For over a decade, gossip swirled around northern Utah that a secretive group of religious zealots were buying up homes to take over a developing neighborhood in an Ogden community. The homes were known far and wide for their immaculately landscaped yards. Rumors spread that a well-known landscaper in the city had proclaimed himself to be a prophet of god and was being commanded to start his own secret religion that promoted polygamy. It was also believed these extremists were stockpiling weapons as part of their doomsday beliefs. In reality, the leader was directing some of the most repugnant crimes against women and children ever seen in the state. The hidden atrocities of the cult may never have been discovered if not for the courage of one of its members. Thirty years later, victims reconnected with each other and with the lead investigator to address the shortcomings of the criminal justice system regarding child victims.\n\nYou can purchase \u0022Deceived\u0022 here: https://www.profilingevil.com/store/p/zionsociety",

By the time her older brother was ten, Lisa\u0027s father had him smoking pot. By the time Lisa was ten, Lisa\u0027s mother had them pledging their lives to the Unification Church (the \u0022Moonies\u0022) and self-appointed Messiah, Reverend Sun Myung Moon. As a child Lisa knew the ecstatic comfort of inclusion in a cult and as a teenager the torment of rebelling against it. As an adult, Lisa struggled to break free from the hold of abuse and the scars in her heart, mind, and psyche--battling her own addictions and inner demons and searching her soul for a sense of self-worth. Told in spirited candor, to the moon and back reveals how one can leave behind absurdity and horror and create a life of intention and joy. \n\nAbout the Author: The best seats Lisa Kohn ever had at Madison Square Garden were at her mother\u0027s wedding, and the best cocaine she ever had was from her father\u0027s friend, the judge. Lisa was raised in a religious cult (the Moonies) with her mom and in a life of \u0022sex, drugs, and squalor\u0022 in New York City\u0027s East Village in the 1970s with her dad. Lisa is now a teacher and public speaker who owns a leadership consulting and executive coaching firm and who works to bring to others the tools, mind-shifts, and practices she\u2019s found that have helped her heal from her crazy, mixed-up childhood.\nYou can read more at her website, www.lisakohnwrites.com, where you can also download the first chapter of her book, watch and read Lisa\u2019s interviews in media such as Megyn Kelly Today, Daily Mail, Marie Claire, and hear her podcast interviews for IndoctrNation, Generation Cult, and Lionrock. Lisa will always tell you that she is a native New Yorker, but she currently lives in Pennsylvania with her husband and two children, whenever they\u2019re around.

She is featured in the CBC investigative podcast Uncover: Escaping NXIVM and The Vow, the HBO documentary series on NXIVM. She is launching her own podcast \u201CA Little Bit Culty\u201D and initiating a movement for healing from cultic abuses called #IGotOut\u200B (igotout.org)\n\nAs seen in the HBO docuseries THE VOW: The shocking and subversive memoir of a 12-year-NXIVM-member-turned-whistleblower, and her inspiring true story of abuse, escape, and redemption. \u0022\u0027Master, would you brand me? It would be an honor.\u0027 From the second I climb onto the table, acutely aware that I am lying in the sweat of my sisters, I will have blocked that out. Lying there completely naked, I am at my most vulnerable but determined to prove my strength. I try to keep my legs closed as my body wills itself to protect my most private area. . . . I tell myself: I am a warrior. I birthed a human. I can handle pain. But nothing could have ever prepared me for the feel of this fire on my skin.\u0022\n\nScarred is Sarah Edmondson\u0027s compelling memoir of her recruitment into the NXIVM cult, the 12 years she spent within the organization, her breaking point, and her harrowing fight to get out, to expose Keith Raniere and the leadership, to help others, and to heal. Complete with personal photographs, Scarred is also an eye-opening story about abuses of power, female trust and friendship, and how sometimes the search to be \u0022better\u0022 can override everything else.",

      "description": "Psycho-Social Aspects of Belief in Conspiracy Theories (Bill Goldberg, LCSW, PsyA)\n\nMore than any other time in recent history, conspiracy theories have contaminated political thinking in this country. Bizarre theories and explanations for current events, both real and imagined, have become an acceptable part of our public dialogue; and some political leaders have given credence to speculations about the motivations of opponents that would once have been viewed as embarrassingly ludicrous.  In this lecture and conversation, we will explore this phenomenon from a psychoanalytic viewpoint. We will discuss the historical antecedents of today\u0027s conspiracy theories and the factors in the Information Age that make it unique. We will also discuss developmental and defensive factors that render otherwise intelligent individuals susceptible to conspiracy theories. \n\nLearning Objectives:\n\n1. Participants will be able to identify the similarities and differences between today\u2019s conspiracy theories and their historical antecedents.\n2. Participants will be able to identify the developmental factors that render people vulnerable to the appeal of conspiracy theories.\n3. Participants will learn intervention techniques that can help clients who believe in bizarre conspiracy theories.\n\nWilliam Goldberg, LCSW, PsyA, is a clinical social worker and psychoanalyst with over forty years\u2019 experience working with former cult members. He and his wife, Lorna, co-lead a support group for former cult members, which has been meeting for over forty years. It is the oldest group of its kind in the world. In 2007, Bill retired from the Rockland County, NY Department of Mental Health, where he directed several programs and clinics. He is presently an adjunct professor in the social work and social science departments of Dominican College and he is on the faculty of the Institute for Psychoanalytic Studies. Bill has published numerous articles. Bill is a frequent speaker at ICSA conferences, and he and Lorna have been the recipients of the Authentic CAN Hall of Fame Award and the Leo J. Ryan Award. In 2010, Bill was the recipient of ICSA\u2019s Lifetime Achievement Award.

      "description": "\u0022Traumatic Narcissism: Relational Systems of Subjugation\u0022\nInterview with Daniel Shaw by Joseph Szimhart\n\nIn this volume, Traumatic Narcissism: Relational Systems of Subjugation, Daniel Shaw presents a way of understanding the traumatic impact of narcissism as it is engendered developmentally, and as it is enacted relationally. Focusing on the dynamics of narcissism in interpersonal relations, Shaw describes the relational system of what he terms the \u0027traumatizing narcissist\u0027 as a system of subjugation \u2013 the objectification of one person in a relationship as the means of enforcing the dominance of the subjectivity of the other. Daniel Shaw illustrates the workings of this relational system of subjugation in a variety of contexts: theorizing traumatic narcissism as an intergenerationally transmitted relational/developmental trauma; and exploring the clinician\u0027s experience working with the adult children of traumatizing narcissists. He explores the relationship of cult leaders and their followers, and examines how traumatic narcissism has lingered vestigially in some aspects of the psychoanalytic profession. Bringing together theories of trauma and attachment, intersubjectivity and complementarity, and the rich clinical sensibility of the Relational Psychoanalysis tradition, Shaw demonstrates how narcissism can best be understood not merely as character, but as the result of the specific trauma of subjugation, in which one person is required to become the object for a significant other who demands hegemonic subjectivity. Traumatic Narcissism presents therapeutic clinical opportunities not only for psychoanalysts of different schools, but for all mental health professionals working with a wide variety of modalities. Although primarily intended for the professional psychoanalyst and psychotherapist, this is also a book that therapy patients and lay readers will find highly readable and illuminating.\n\nAbout the Author:\nDaniel Shaw, LCSW is a psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapist in private practice in New York City, and in Nyack, New York. He is a training analyst, teacher and supervisor of analytic candidates at the National Institute for the Psychotherapies in New York City.

      "description": "\u0022Whispering in the Daylight: The Children of Tony Alamo Christian Ministries and Their Journey to Freedom\u0022\nInterview with Debby Schriver by Joseph Szimhart\n\nBeginning in the 1960s in California, erstwhile music producer Tony Alamo became interested in authoritarian religion and, along with his charismatic wife, Susan, began gathering followers. By the 1970s, Tony Alamo Christian Ministries had established particularly strong footholds in Arkansas, as well as maintaining outposts in California. The ministry gained a legion of followers, with branches not only in the USA but in places as diverse as Africa and Sri Lanka. Even through their leader\u2019s eventual imprisonment under federal charges (related to transporting minors across state lines for sexual purposes), Alamo\u2019s vision survived\u2014and his community survives him today.\n\nWhispering in the Daylight: The Children of Tony Alamo Christian Ministries and Their Journey to Freedom is based on numerous interviews from group members and, more importantly, on interviews with the children\u2014second and third-generation followers. Author Debby Schriver chronicles how this group was formed, documenting its many abuses and its gradual adoption of cult-like behaviors and practices. Like many cult leaders, Tony Alamo had different faces. The public saw him as a somewhat self-important but harmless music promoter and designer of bedazzling denim jackets. Schriver chronicles firsthand the condemnation, rejection, and torment that the second-generation survivors of Tony Alamo\u2019s abuses experienced. Schriver\u2019s interviews, particularly those with children, illuminate the real horrors of the Alamos\u2019 behavior, ranging from economic exploitation, extreme forced fasts, and beatings, that resulted in permanent injury.\n\nSchriver\u2019s extensive research\u2014including interviews with Tony Alamo himself, harrowing visits to Alamo compounds, and witnessing gut-wrenching confrontations between freed children and their unreformed parents\u2014tells the story of a closed group whose origins and history are unlikely ever to be definitively unraveled.\n\nAbout the Author:\nDEBBY SCHRIVER has spent her career working with students, parents, and staff in the departments of student life and employee training and development at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. She is the author of In the Footsteps of Champions: The University of Tennessee Lady Volunteers, the First Three Decades, coauthor, with Jenny Moshak, of Ice \u2019n\u2019 Go: Score in Sports and Life, and coeditor, with Lucia McMahon of To Read My Heart: The Journal of Rachel Van Dyke, 1810\u20131811.\n\nYou can purchase Debby\u0027s book here: https://www.amazon.com/Whispering-Daylight-Children-Christian-Ministries/dp/1621903869",

Moderated by Ashlen Hilliard, ICSA\n\nA year ago Phil Elberg, former president of ICSA and winner of the first Margaret Singer Award for Advancing the Understanding of Coercive Influence spoke at a meeting of ICSA\u2019s New York Chapter. For the first time in a public forum Phil told the story of how while looking into a case in his law office against the leader of a drug rehabilitation program led by Miller Newton, he made the cultic connection to his sister\u2019s involvement with an abusive cult leader, Fred Newman, and how making that connection led to his success in exposing the cultic nature of Kids and Straight, Inc.  Phil\u2019s fascinating and moving talk included a discussion of his advocacy work in the troubled teen industry and other cultic groups including NXIVM and focused from the perspective of a practicing lawyer what \u201Ccult law\u201D is and is not.  It concluded with a discussion of the legal issues that people concerned about cults focus on.\n\n\u0022Keeping a family member from joining a toxic group;\nGetting them out if they are in;\nOnce they are in preventing a loved one from turning over financial assets \nAttempting to speak out about a cultic group (particularly on the internet) after leaving as part of the healing process and with the goal of helping others;\nSuing the group or its leaders for economic and emotional damages arising from cult involvement;\nDealing with family court issues of custody and visitation when one parent remains and one leaves;  \nUsing proof of brainwashing to excuse criminal conduct, mitigate a criminal penalty or convince prosecutors to pursue a prosecution of a group or its leader.\u0022\n\nICSA has decided to make Phil\u2019s talk available on the internet as a stimulus presentation and to then provide an interactive discussion with Phil Elberg, Bill Goldberg, Pat Ryan, and Joseph Kelly moderated by Ashlen Hilliard in which legal and related issues associated with these topics can be discussed.\n\nPhil Elberg, Esq. \u2013 pelberglaw@gmail.com \n\nWilliam Goldberg, LCSW, PsyA \u2013 bill@blgoldberg.com \n(blgoldberg.com)\n\nPat Ryan \u2013 pryan19147@gmail.com  \nJoseph Kelly -- joekelly411@gmail.com \n(CultNews101.com)\n(Cults101.org)\n(CultMediation.com): \n(Intervention101.com)\n(CultRecovery101.com)",

With a solid background in the entertainment field, he proposes that art is the antidote to thought reform. His presentation will encompass the mechanics of undue influence and cultic dynamics focusing on coercive institutionalized persuasion. His hope is to reach younger audiences as they enter careers in psychology and other social sciences. He works to create and promote media to illustrate the common dynamics of high-control groups wherever they appear: in the teen-treatment related programs, in religious failure, in strife at home, and as part of the US court system. Part of a larger plea for increased individual awareness, Zack Bonnie\u0027s mission is to educate the public - through the arts - about the systems applied in these institutions.",

These techniques were ostensibly employed to help Straight\u2019s victims overcome the problems and addictions that Straight claimed they had. Spin-offs still exist today.\n\nSunny is now a make-up artist/esthetician and a trainer in retail cosmetics. She was recently interviewed in the new movie, Surviving Straight Inc., a Documentary. Sunny was also the lead make-up artist for the film.\n\nMs. Linkfield is active with the International Cultic Studies Association and serves on the Board of Directors of the Community Alliance For the Ethical Treatment of Youth.

      "description": "Former Member Guilt and the Path to Self-Forgiveness (Nori Muster, Lorna Goldberg)\n\nWhen individuals join a dangerous cult, they unconsciously adopt the group\u2019s negative habits. Certain assumptions in the group\u2019s \u201Cperfect\u201D dogma contribute to this process, for example, leaders might openly profess \u201Canything is allowed if it\u2019s done for god,\u201D \u201Cthe guru said it\u2019s okay, so it\u2019s okay,\u201D and \u201Cthe laws of man do not apply to us because we dedicated ourselves to god.\u201D To prove themselves loyal, new recruits quickly learn to repress their gut feelings and rightly-felt doubts. Authoritarian groups operate under a \u201Cno talk\u201D rule, where it is considered a grave sin to acknowledge shortcomings in the hierarchy. For example, in ISKCON, the Krishna consciousness organization, they called it \u201Cblasphemy of a pure devotee\u201D to speak about anything the gurus did wrong. Meanwhile, gurus notoriously did dishonest things and involved followers in unethical behavior that would make any normal person feel shame. Gurus then use this shame to manipulate followers. While under the spell of the group, even good, honest people who join may internalize the attitudes of arrogance and denial. They may never uncover any reason to feel guilt. However, most often, former members who took part in crimes and abuses do feel guilt after they leave. Ex-members\u2019 guilt may be overly harsh, due to internalizing cult leaders\u2019 punitive and uncompassionate attitudes. In this presentation, Nori Muster will discuss her personal struggle overcoming post-cult guilt, and Lorna Goldberg and Nori will discuss reasons why former members may hold onto or deny the guilt they feel. Lorna will share self-forgiveness tools to help ex-members reframe their experiences, reduce their self-punishing attitudes, and free themselves from their groups once and for all.",

      "description": "Parent to Parent: Keeping Your Teen Safe and Prevention Before Recruitment: Where do we Begin? (Robin Boyle-Laisure and Andrea Laisure)\n\nThis talk will address various forms of harmful relationships affecting pre-teens, teenagers, and young adults. Attempts to lure minors and young adults into organizations take the form of religious or non-religious cults, with college campuses as vulnerable sites for recruitment. International human trafficking rings, have become increasingly difficult to police. Furthermore, as detailed in Rachel Lloyd\u0027s book, Girls Like Us, teenagers are often targets of commercial sexual exploitation. In addition, are incidents of one-on-one abuse between teens within romantic relationships. Previously depicted as \u0022\u0022domestic violence\u0022\u0022 among adults, there can be similar harmful dynamics between teenagers. In Part I of my talk, I would focus on how undue influence plays a role in the following: - Recruitment into cults; (many speakers will address this, so this would be short) - Recruitment into human trafficking rings; - Commercial sex industry; and - Abusive one-on-one romantic relationships. And Part II would be - how to talk to your pre-teen and teenager to prevent these relationships from forming; - warning signs for parents about abusive relationships their children may be having; - suggested ways to handle if you\u0027ve suspected a dangerous relationship; and - where to turn for help.\n\n\nPrevention Before Recruitment: Where do we Begin? \n\nAlexandra Stein \n\nIn 1952, Solomon Asch, the great social psychologist and scholar of social influence, wrote: \u201CThe greater man\u2019s ignorance of the principles of his social surroundings, the more subject is he to their control; and the greater his knowledge of their operations and of their necessary consequences, the freer he can become with regard to them.\u201D Unfortunately, there has been little progress in the 21st century on developing public education to remedy this ignorance of controlling social influence mechanisms and thereby increase resistance in the general population to recruitment to cults and extremist groups. This paper will examine why this might be so, and propose what steps can be taken to increase knowledge of social influence to strengthen this resistance. I will suggest that prevention of both cult involvement and radicalization to extremism requires teaching people, in an ideologically neutral way, specifically about totalist groups and relationships including the methods, structures and likely outcomes of such involvements. Current prevention efforts on extremism tend to be targeted at those already recruited, or at least exposed to recruitment attempts. I will suggest that we must start much earlier in the process and reinforce this education at all levels of learning. Educators and policy makers can contribute to this effort by drawing on the rich history of research in the social and psychological sciences that has accumulated over the past 70 years, along with contemporary scholarship.",

      "description": "Applying Cultural Competency to Work with Former Cult Members (Matthew Staton, MDiv Counseling)\n\nHow can we improve competence in counseling clients emerging from coercive religious backgrounds? Training and conceptual models for use with this specific population are scarce. However, research and anecdotal evidence indicate that each coercive group (broadly defined, a cult) creates its own culture, complete with a unique body of knowledge, morality, rules, literature, and terminology. This culture so shapes its adherents that second-generation adults often feel like third-culture kids when assimilating into mainstream culture after exiting the cult. A question we often encounter in our online cult-recovery groups is whether anyone can recommend a local counselor who \u201Cgets it\u201D \u2014 that is, someone who understands how deeply the cult\u0027s teachings are ingrained and can help them overcome the conditioned responses that inhibit their assimilation into society outside the cult. In this session, we will address the vacuum that exists for counselors working with this population by building on the premise that a cult is a culture. Approaching a cult as a culture provides counselors with an opportunity to apply their existing cultural competence. It also implies possible challenges for the client that might not otherwise be obvious in communicating between the cult and mainstream culture. We will use the knowledge and skills related to cultural competence in general to suggest interventions for working with those who have experienced abusive spiritual systems.",

      "description": "Can A Fish See Water? (Cathy Harris)\n\nCathy Harris is a former member of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. She committed to the group by baptism at 17 years old. After 23 years and a suicide attempt, she began attending college (in spite of the group\u2019s ban on higher education). After 3 years, at 43 years old, she made the decision to \u201Cdisassociate\u201D from the group, essentially ex-communicating herself. Reading Lifton\u0027s work, Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism: A Study of \u0022Brainwashing\u0022 in China and The Orwellian World of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses by Gary and Heather Botting was life-changing and put her on a path to leaving the religious group she had served for 26 years. Freedom and personal integrity\u2014foreign concepts in the group\u2014became paramount as she struggled to leave the cocoon of membership behind.

As Cathy tells her own story she will demonstrate her adaptation of Dr. Colin Ross\u2019 Trauma Model for treatment and she will answer:\n\nWho joins cults and why? \nWhat makes individuals begin to question their group involvement? \nWhat if no qualified support is available? \nHow can family members and friends help their loved ones who are involved? \nWhat challenges do survivors face as they recover? \nHow can parents help their children resist participation in cultic groups?",

      "description": "Ready to Mine: Zen\u0027s Legitimating Mythology and Cultish Behavior (Stuart Lachs)\n\nZen Buddhism was the first of Eastern religions to gain wide acceptance in the West post WWII. It was accepted mostly uncritically by artists and intellectuals alike. However, beginning in the 1970\u2019s, the most prominent Zen groups in America were wracked by scandal. In spite of these repetitive scandals caused by the sexual abuse of students by their supposedly enlightened Zen masters, Zen followers and academics have refused to associate the phrase \u201Ccultish behavior\u201D to these developments. This was not the case with a range of Christian oriented groups or with Asian teachers associated with other traditions or a variety of other groups, though the Zen scandals mirrored these groups. This paper will show how Zen\u2019s legitimating story and mythic history lays the ground work for authoritarian inclined charismatic leaders - titled Zen master or rosh i- to draw his followers into a world dependent on obedience, his approval and with an ethical frame dependent on the master\u2019s self serving understanding. Though Zen presents its idealized master as being fully in the world, spontaneous, unattached, a state in which one is internally firm and free while remaining perceptually competent in the world, this has hardly been the case. This is not an abstract conjecture as the paper will mention a number of examples of Zen masters, both Eastern and Western and their followers that displayed cultish behavior, while highlighting one case in particular. It is by explaining the mythic and idealized legitimating story of Zen that helps followers make sense of their lives and earlier choices when these groups implode. After all, the Zen mythology of the super human Zen master was developed over hundreds of years which makes it hard to counter for individuals breaking with a group when the Zen master\u2019s great attainment is shown to be wishful thinking.",

Issues include the effects of institutionalized sexual coercion, hypersexuality and/or sexual repression. Psychological abuse related to sexuality will be discussed, both in terms of sexual and intimacy issues while in the group, and after a person leaves the group. Strategies are offered for developing beneficial attitudes and behaviors related to sexuality and intimacy as a part of healing from cult involvement.",

      "description": "Brainwashing - Scientific Concept or Mere Label (Dr. Benjamin Zablocki; Daniel Shaw)\n\nBrainwashing is not an easy concept to pin down. For decades it has been the most controversial of all words in the vocabulary of those who try to understand cults. Many scholars even doubt whether something called \u201Cbrainwashing\u201D should be spoken of at all, regarding it as nothing more than an insulting label used to scare people about the activities of socially unpopular groups. On the contrary, I\u2019m going to argue here tonight that \u201Cbrainwashing\u201D is not only a valid scientific concept but an essential one if we are to have any hope of understanding cults and helping people recover from cults. For a complete understanding of brainwashing we should try to understand three things: (1) what precisely brainwashing is; (2) how it works; and (3) how victims of brainwashing may be cured. Because the concept has been so misunderstood, I\u2019m going to focus here mainly on defining what brainwashing is (and equally important what it is not). If there is time, I will also discuss what we know about how it works and how its harmful effects can be undone. For those interested, more on these topics can be found on my website: benzablocki.net and on my Facebook page \u201CBenjamin Zablocki.\u201D",

      "description": "On Being Born and Raised in a High-Demand Group (Jill Mytton)\n\nPurpose: The purpose of this paper is to stimulate awareness and discussion of the impact on child development of being raised in a high-demand group. Background: Influences from parents, teachers and other sources that promote and facilitate normal childhood development are important aspects of the early years of an individual\u2019s life. Despite an increase in research in the cultic studies field there is still relatively little literature regarding the impact on a child\u2019s development of being born and raised in a cultic group. Using a specific example of such a group, namely the Exclusive Brethren, this paper will explore the experiences of and impact on children being raised in high-demand groups Key points: The paper is based on an informal thematic analysis of descriptions and stories provided by former members via email and social media. Like many similar groups, the brethren exert considerable control over their members based on their doctrine of \u201Cseparation from evil,\u201D a doctrine many consider to be taken to extremes. Now that their children only attend Brethren schools, all influence from sources outside the group that could offer alternative perspectives or narratives are absent. A number of important themes have emerged including the experience of fear and guilt, the impact of such a closed separate life on social development, the lack of life skills that inhibits them if they leave, and the common experience of dissonance as the child seeks to resolve the messages from different environments and narratives. The paper will also present findings from a quantitative study that suggests that control imposed in childhood might resonate in adult life through long term psychological sequelae Conclusions: I will argue that control imposed in childhood may affect various aspects of child development and may later impact on adult mental health.",

      "description": "First Generation Parents and Second Generation Children (Lorna Goldberg)\n\nOne of the most painful aspects of the cult experience is the undermining of the natural bond between parents who are in cults and their children. This presentation will explore the numerous techniques that cult leaders use to diminish the empathic connection between 37 parents and their children. The presenter also will discuss the powerful feelings that emerge when exiting a cult. How can those who leave the cult better deal with potentially crushing emotions? Often there is intense guilt on the part of the parents. On the other hand, there is often intense anger on the part of the second-generation adults. These emotions can be so overwhelming that former cult members can become unable to move towards a more satisfactory life. This presentation will contend that these post-cult feelings not only are the result of facing the reality of the cult experience; but, also, are a legacy of identification with the cult leader\u2019s punitive and uncompassionate attitude, which results in a harsh conscience for cult members. The presenter will provide examples from her clinical work, from the support group that she facilitates with Bill Goldberg, from workshops with first generation parents, and from ICSA workshops with second-generation former cult members. All case material will be disguised.",

Each of these studies offers well-documented evidence of antisocial acts and behaviors by cult leaders toward cult members. These published accounts, as well as previously unpublished author research, are used to develop an explanatory model of the personality organization of the cult leader. Additionally, the emergence of dependent personality disorder and other psychological sequelae among cult members is investigated. Diagnostic criteria and descriptions describing antisocial personality disorder as published in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th Edition (1994) can be employed as part of the characterization of the personality organization of the cult leader. The author has participated as a clinical team member in the diagnosis of personality disorders for juvenile offenders in the California Juvenile Probation Department and for juvenile and adult offenders in the Colorado Department of Corrections. A number of peer-reviewed studies including studies by Martin, Langone, Dole, and Wiltrout, (1992); Tobias \u0026 Lalich, (1994); West \u0026 Martin, (1999); and Kent (2004), present findings from clinical interviews of ex-cult members, which report many different antisocial acts and behaviors by cult leaders. These accounts detail numerous instances of personal mistreatment, psychological intimidation, and physical and sexual abuse of cult members by cult leaders, and offer credible evidence for the hypothesis that cult leaders may meet minimum DSM-IV criteria for diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD).",

      "description": "Listening to the still small voice: Reclaiming the self after leaving religious totalistic groups (Catherine De Boer) \n\nMemberships in social groups are central to one\u2019s self- understandings and can provide individuals with purpose, meaning, and feelings of competence and value. At times, these memberships also can test and potentially compromise one\u2019s self-understandings. In either case, disengagement from a social group has identity implications, and \u201Cfinding,\u201D \u201C(re)claiming\u201D or \u0027discovering\u201D one\u2019s self is a crucial component of a successful leaving. Using disengagement from religious totalistic groups as its focus, an argument will be made that some individuals leaving such groups not only face identity challenges typical of other socialgroup leavings, but in addition may also need to cope with the impacts of mind control, trauma, abuse, and the ego destruction they experienced in the group. These unique challenges can make achievement of identity congruence postmembership especially difficult. This presentation will highlight findings from two research studies that investigated the identity implications of disengagement from a variety of social groups. The first study (2007) investigated voluntary disengagement; a current study is investigating forced leavings. These qualitative studies using a narrative analysis had as their central aims (a) to discover whether a disengagement process exists, and if so, to discover the defining characteristics and phenomenological aspects; (b) to describe the shifts in identity that accompany the process; and (c) to consider clinical or treatment implications. This presentation will make the following claims: (a) that social group disengagement is a definable social process, and what we know about this broader phenomenon bears relevance to exiting religious totalistic groups; (b) the degree to which the associated identity-based challenges are acknowledged and addressed could determine the trajectory of the individual\u2019s life, postgroup membership; and (c) a good 33 outcome includes the achievement of identity congruence and personal agency. Specific treatment strategies and practice implications will be discussed.",

These fundamental assumptions derive in large part from experience, rather than rational deliberation. In some conversions powerful inner experiences, whether manipulated (\u0022outer generated\u0022) or not (\u0022inner generated\u0022), may cause a person to adopt new fundamental assumptions. Sometimes, a new set of experiences can cause a convert to reject the new assumptions and leave the group. The resulting disillusionment may cause serious adjustment problems.

      "description": "A Practical Approach for Law Enforcement when Dealing with Cultic Groups (Mark Roggeman)\n\nMany people who have had an experience with cults because a relative became involved have been disillusioned when they have asked law enforcement for help.  The response they usually get is that there is not much that can be done unless there is illegal activity.  The police concern is that they may be interfering with the freedom of religion.  In the present day, police departments are successfully using problem-solving models through the Community Policing model.  This model can also be implemented when a questionable group comes to the attention of local police departments.  A simple approach that officers can take is to visit a group and let them know who they are and that they are there to assist them.  They can let the group know that the department is there to protect them from those who might dislike the group or who possibly threaten to cause harm.  The connection that results could possibly cause authorities to become aware of the group\u2019s behavior, so that the authorities may be able to observe any changes that might occur relative to the group that could signal a violation of the law or even harm to the members. Law enforcement, both local and federal, most often become involved with cults after a tragedy occurs, such as suicide, involvement in financial fraud, or a case that affects children through neglect or abuse, including sexual violations.  Most of these groups probably will never do anything that attracts the attention of law enforcement.  The problem is that illegal activities that are not known to anyone outside the group do go on because of the group\u2019s isolation from the rest of society.  This kind of situation is one in which officers become effective in gathering intelligence by getting to know the group.  The result is that officers may become aware of illegal activities.  I personally had members of a group in southern Colorado reach out to me because they did not know anyone one else outside the group.  Through this connection, authorities learned that children had died, they believe because medicine was denied as a result of the group\u2019s belief that to take medicine reflected a lack of faith. An article on cultic groups in the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin of September 2000 stated accurately that the potential for violence on behalf of members of biblically driven cults is determined almost exclusively by the whims of the cult leader.  Therefore, effective intelligence and analysis of such cults requires an extensive understanding of the cult leader. To address the concern of authorities about violating the protection of individuals\u2019 freedom of religion, officers need to be concerned only with behavior that may be harmful to people both inside and outside the group.  Granted, the beliefs may be the cause of the harmful behavior, but only the behavior is the cause for concern.",

      "description": "Saved by our Son (Russell H. Bradshaw)\n\nMost of the literature on childrenin high-demand groups focuses on how distraught parents and desperate families attempt to get young people out of a cultic group. This case study, set in both Sweden and the United States tells the opposite story. An adolescent, resisting the belief system of parents and the norms of the spiritual group he was raised in, revolted and struck out on his own path. He quickly found out that the leader was in fact, not the celibate and \u201Crealized\u201D guru he claimed to be, but a deceptive and manipulative narcissist. In the midst of his own alienation and suffering, he nevertheless struggled for several years trying to convince his \u201Ctrue-believer\u201D parents of the hypocritical behavior of the leader. He also had to contend with the morally corrupt rationalizations, denials, and double-standards adopted by the inner circle of first-class disciples and other followers who tried to destroy his credibility, his career, and his relationships. Finally, amidst death threats, police complaints, and an intense \u201Cinternet war\u201D that erupted when he created a web-site, which included first-person accounts of sexual abuse by several young women, he managed to convince his parents and drag them out of the group -after almost a quarter of a century of belief and devoted service to their Guru.Central to this case study is the psychodynamic theory of Erik Erikson concerning the adolescent stage of development labeled, \u201Cidentity versus role-confusion.\u201D The specific identity crisis at this stage is the necessity of choosing an identitystatus and the use of resistance behavior to develop this identity. In Erikson\u2019s theories, adolescent revolt, turmoil, and resistance are seen as positive attributes that are necessary to the positive development of personality",

Most ethical codes for mental health professionals include a commitment to self-care, and to ensure that they do not work in a way that becomes detrimental to their health or well-being.

Sue will present her research around how anger and rage are different processes requiring different therapeutic responses. Gillie will outline her research on cult pseudo-personality and discuss the interaction of this with anger and rage.\n\nIt is argued that, in many cults, anger may be projected outside the group and personal anger may go underground; as a consequence, a cult member may lose the capacity to develop and protect his or her unique identity. And as a consequence of this, the cult member may become vulnerable to the persuasion and control of a thought-reform program. Alienated from one\u2018s organismic self, an individual introjects a compliant \u0027pseudo-personality\u0027 (Jenkinson, 2008) which overlays the pre-cult personality. When genuine emotional responses are forsaken, life experiences remain unprocessed and unintegrated, and cult members may operate from a state of cold rage, which often continues after leaving the group.\n\nThere will also be some discussion about Sue\u2018s ideas on \u2017adult rage\u2018. She notes there is a difference between trauma-related and nontrauma-related rage, and she identifies the negative impact of the former and the positive impact of the latter on the aims and practice of social activism.",

      "description": "Critical Thinking Skills for Former Cult Members (Doug Duncan, M.S., L.P.C.; Wendy Duncan, M.A., L.B.S.W.)\n\nFormer cult members often ask themselves, \u0022How could I have been duped so easily?\u0022 While it is certainly the case that cult recruiters make manipulative, emotional appeals, bypassing the prospective member\u0027s reason and informed consent, there are certain learned cognitive skills we can all develop that help to make us more resistant to such manipulation. What are those skills? How can I develop my reason and intellectual discernment to make it more difficult for someone to sell me a bill of goods? What can I teach my children so that they will be less subject to the dark allure of a seductive cult recruiter? Drawing from some of the basic texts in critical thinking, Doug and Wendy Duncan will show why the acquisition of critical thinking skills is helpful in a variety of contexts. Obviously, one is less likely to be drawn into a cult when one can quickly recognize a manipulative, emotional appeal, but these skills have a broad utility in many areas of modern life, such as analysis of slanted news reports, identifying deceptive sales techniques, seeing through unethical public figures, and even in facilitating informed participation in our civic institutions. Indeed, it is hard to think of any other skill set that has so many important applications as does critical thinking. Doug and Wendy will give a quick overview of critical thinking in history, identify some of the basic skills, and then have some participatory exercises that will allow for experiential learning by the workshop participants. Learning these skills cannot only help former members to keep from being re-victimized by another high-demand group, it can also facilitate their recovery process by increasing their sense of empowerment. Since the topic is so broad and cannot be exhaustively covered in the short time available for this workshop, Doug and Wendy will have handouts with a bibliography to suggest how the participants can further develop their critical thinking skills.",

      "description": "The Colorado Model: A Workshop for Ex-Members (Carol Giambalvo; Rosanne Henry) \n\nFor the past sixteen years, ICSA has been developing a brief, time-limited, yet comprehensive group model for cult recovery, which we call the Colorado Model because it was developed and refined in that state. This model consists of weekend workshops that are open to former members of destructive cults who have applied and been screened for their compatibility for attendance. The Colorado Model differs from other workshops in its strong emphasis on psycho-education and its use of former member facilitators who are mental health professionals. The ex-member facilitator team, equipped with the important credentials of cult recovery often instills hope for those struggling with cult trauma.\n\nThe Colorado Model is similar to the Trauma Recovery and Empowerment Model (TREM). This approach uses an educational and supportive, skill-building curriculum that allows members to understand and acknowledge the impact of abuse while focusing their energies on developing techniques for mastery and enhancing     their existing strengths for coping with their current life events (Harris \u0026 Fallot, 2002). The Colorado Model adapts this approach to unique workshops that address the needs of former cult members.",

In order to manipulate followers, the cult leader is revered and group members believe that God has specifically chosen him and given him absolute authority.  The cult leader\u2019s claim that God has imparted a unique and special revelation justifies his existence as the leader and his right to exercise control.  Members of pseudo-Christian cults are taught to accept the cult leader\u2019s authority as divinely mandated.  Any doubt or questions are quickly extinguished by the leader or the group culture that dismisses external influences that contradict the groups stated mission or vision.  Through spiritual manipulation, the leader is able to obtain control over the devotees.  The tactics of manipulation include the use of guilt, peer pressure, intimidation, ridicule, and fear.  Over time, the cult member is deluged with fears of thinking independently, making wrong decisions, losing salvation, losing his relationship with God, experiencing extreme calamity if he leaves the group, and numerous other horrors.\nA panel discussion of former members of pseudo-Christian cults will focus on the spiritually manipulative techniques employed by their former cults.  The panel will focus on four primary areas:\n\nManipulative techniques used by leader(s)\nThe role of fear in pseudo-Christian cults\nObstacles in transitioning out of a spiritually manipulative group/religion\nReconnecting with faith after cult affiliation",
