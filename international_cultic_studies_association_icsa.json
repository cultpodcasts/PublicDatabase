The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: One of the challenges in the pursuit of justice in relation to abusive religious cults is galvanizing authorities into action. Using KwaSizabantu Mission in South Africa as a case study, this paper examines how ex-members involved the media and how the subsequent media expos\u00E9 prompted authorities to investigate KSB, paying particular attention to the ongoing role of trauma in the lives of the survivors. It is well-documented that ongoing trauma symptoms have a direct bearing on the ability of former members to participate in legal and investigative processes to pursue justice and hold the perpetrators accountable.\n\nThe paper will give a brief overview of the childhood trauma experienced at KwaSizabantu as documented in the testimonies of survivors and the ongoing spiritual, physical, social, and psychological manifestations of childhood trauma throughout adulthood in the lives of those who have left KwaSizabantu. Using personal testimonies and video footage, we will discuss the impact of ongoing trauma, the media exposure, and investigative procedures on survivors attempting to seek justice. This will be done with a view to understanding broader ethical considerations in the handling of survivor testimonies. Specifically, the challenges of trauma-informed representation to aid survivors in speaking out will be examined in reference to the approach taken by investigative panels, the media, and KwaSizabantu itself. Because these investigations have coincided with the COVID pandemic, consideration will also be given to some of the ways in which lockdowns and restrictions mitigated or contributed to further trauma for the survivors.",

      "description": "The PsychoSocial Quicksand Model\u2122: An Investigation Into the Efficacy of the Model for Survivors of Coercive Control and Professionals and Implications for Education and Practice - Kate Amber, Rod Dubrow-Marshall\n-\nDisclaimer: This session was delivered for the 2023 ICSA Conference. The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: The PsychoSocial Quicksand Model\u2122 is an educational resource and toolkit designed to help survivors, families, and the public better understand the nature of coercive control in abusive relationships and groups. The research reported in this presentation is a mixed-methods investigation into the validity and effectiveness of the PSQM\u2122 involving interviews and the completion of questionnaires. Participants (N=59) were recruited online and are a mixture of survivors of intimate partner violence, cults (both forms of coercion), and professionals in the field. Each participant watched a series of seven videos about the model and completed a series of evaluative questions about how helpful the model was to them. They also completed a series of questionnaires about their own experiences of coercive control and mental health. A subset of the participants (n=13) also volunteered to be interviewed about their experience of learning about the model. Analysis of the qualitative data indicated that the model was well received, with a broad theme reflecting core aspects of the model and a theme reflecting survivors\u0027 stories, indicating a good degree of resonance between the model and prior experiences. Quantitative analysis indicated that, with some of the model videos and questions, the survivors (some of whom were also professionals) showed greater appreciation than participants who were professionals with no survivor experiences. This is further evidence that the model reflects survivor experience and is potentially helpful to survivor recovery. Additional analysis indicates the extent to which reported levels of coercion and mental health vary according to participant group and following, as well as prior to, the watching of the model videos. There are some key implications for the further development of the PSQM\u2122 and for education, practice, and professionals in the field that need to be disseminated more widely.",

      "description": "The Many Facets of Identity Recovery on Escaping a Cult - Peter Blachly\n-\nDisclaimer: This session was delivered for the 2023 ICSA Conference. The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: In writing about my own experience thirty-five years after leaving Yogi Bhajan\u0027s cult of the American Sikhs, I have come to the conclusion that \u0022you can take a person out of a cult, but it is much harder to take the cult out of a person,\u0022 to paraphrase a common saying. Cults have a profound impact on every aspect of a person\u0027s identity and well-being, influencing their appearance, worldview, sense of agency, ethical framework, spiritual superiority, sense of shame, and more. Recovering from a cult entails reclaiming an authentic sense of identity, free from the distorted norms imposed by the cult in virtually every aspect of life. These norms are often deeply ingrained, and ex-cult members may not even be aware of their origin or their ongoing influence on their lives.\n\nFor instance, many eastern spiritual cults promote the belief in past life \u0022karma\u0022 as a determinant of current situations, such as social status within the cult or the justification for unethical behavior, such as sexual abuse by the cult leader. Since most cults consume every aspect of a person\u0027s beliefs, attitudes, practices, and lifestyle, former members face immense challenges to their sense of identity upon leaving, and it often takes many years to confront the lingering effects of the cult.\n\nThis presentation will delve into the various factors that continue to exert destructive influence even after physically leaving a cult, providing insights into the lasting impact on individuals. Additionally, it will offer options and strategies for regaining a healthy and authentic sense of identity.",

      "description": "War Trauma Outside of War Zones - Olivia Djouadi\n-\nDisclaimer: This session was delivered for the 2023 ICSA Conference. The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: When war breaks out, people can go through a training regime so they are ready to face the war on both sides. The skills taught can seem outrageous within a non-war situation. It can also seem at odds with human rights even within a war situation. So, one might see skills to use weapons as important but other tactics are less noted such as rape or captivity.\n\nPeople are also trained how to hold people captive or rape as the other side are seen as the enemy or subhuman even if say in a civil war, they lived close to each other. Rape can bring a feeling of shame so those that experienced this are less likely to say what happened or be believed.\n\nSo, during or after the war people who are trained may go abroad and even reach places like the United Kingdom. They will use tactics they learned in or for war to use on people not within a war zone. Sometimes if a survivor escapes it will be seen as domestic violence rather than war trauma which has a different flavour. They may say all authority figures such as police, military, the court system, religion etc will shoot you if you look at them. They may describe exactly which weapon they will use. It can make life after terrifying and one feels they will get killed just being in public. They may encourage you to act in ways that don\u2019t even make sense once away from the captivity.\n\nSo, what options do people have if they reached safety and are too scared to talk? I will also discuss what can help in the Western world.",

The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: During this time of COVID, our level of fear has risen greatly. People are afraid because of the ongoing and virulent nature of this illness, as well as its unpredictability. The fact that it can be so communicable and also have a long-lasting impact has caused a sharp increase in interest in conspiratorial thinking, psychics, healers, shamans, channelers, and the like who tout magical energy cures or peddle pseudoscience and protective potions.\n\nSimultaneously, there has been a lessening of civility and the impossibility, at times, of having a conversation about this issue without it erupting into a fight. Families and communities have been torn apart, and people have dealt with increasing isolation caused by social distancing and discord.\n\nAs we know, cult leaders and those pushing pseudoscience take advantage of these moments, providing replacement communities and preying on people\u0027s fears in order to ensnare them. This presentation will explore what causes us to say \u0022yes\u0022 to people offering us community and protection when there is a part of us inside doubting that this is the answer. It will investigate what people can be compelled to ignore within themselves and why good and important questions remain unasked.",

The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: Spiritual abuse is often an integral part of other experiences of harm and abuse for those in faith communities and related contexts. This paper will present some of the findings of a recent study conducted in the UK in partnership between a Christian domestic violence charity and a charity for divorced or separated clergy spouses/partners. The study focused on developing understanding and effective support for victims of domestic abuse in the Christian faith community. 199 respondents completed an online survey, of whom 69% had experienced domestic violence. Among these respondents, 60% had concurrently experienced spiritual abuse, highlighting the inter-relationship between these forms of harm. The paper will explore experiences of spiritual abuse within the context of domestic violence, including a discussion of key passages, teachings, and values identified as contributors to experiences of domestic abuse, as well as those that were seen as potentially helpful for those who have experienced this form of abuse. Importantly, it will draw on survivor suggestions for prevention, intervention, and response.",

The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: My presentation will discuss persistent challenges in Scientology research and the way forward. In my previous research, I analyzed the significance of expertise in grounding and justifying a religion\u0027s claim of legitimacy in the eyes of the law. I traced the emergence of CESNUR and, more broadly, a community of scholars who take a notably more favorable stance on Scientology, influencing the diversity of Scientology research. While I, like others, have criticized the rigor of their research, it will undoubtedly impact legal and political decision-makers. Building on my previous research, my presentation will explore the academic approaches and theories employed by these scholars in their analysis of Scientology. I will discuss and aim to refute their main assertion that prior to their involvement, Scientology research lacked sophistication by (1) focusing on Scientology\u0027s organizational behavior instead of its theology, beliefs, and practices, and (2) overly relying on testimonies from former members.\n\nWhile it is true that previous Scientology research has sometimes failed to distinguish adequately between Scientology\u0027s beliefs and organizational behavior, there are substantive legal and analytical justifications for studying Scientology\u0027s organizational behavior. Due to the comprehensive nature of Scientology\u0027s belief and governance system, its organizational behavior is often driven by and inseparable from its theology. Focusing solely on Scientology\u0027s theology presents an incomplete and misleading portrayal. A comprehensive and accurate understanding of Scientology, on the other hand, acknowledges its differences from other religions and new religious movements.\n\nThe criticism of relying on the testimonies of former members is, although not explicitly stated, ideological and misguided. It can partly be attributed to the objection of traditional Scientology scholars to using testimonies from current members. Both objections make unsupported, sweeping claims about reliability and detract from rigorous and nuanced academic analysis.",

The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: This presentation argues for the importance of identifying fraud and forgery as analytical categories for the study of religion when examining data from the ancient world into the contemporary period. It builds upon the foundational work of Arthur J. Droge, a scholar of Hebrew Bible/Old Testament, and Bart D. Ehrman, a New Testament scholar, both of whom wrote about fraud and forgery in the ancient world. The discussion then expands to include a wide range of religions throughout history, including several contemporary sects, cults, and/or \u0027new religions.\u0027\n\nWhile the focus of work on the ancient world is primarily on textual frauds and forgeries, a broader examination of religion encompasses fraudulent artifacts and both embellished and falsified religious credentials. Recent analyses of criminal acts emphasize the prevalence of religiously based affinity fraud. Many of these frauds and forgeries challenge the legitimacy and authority claims made by religious leaders and their followers, and some have had significant social, legal, and political impacts.\n\nMaryam Razavy will present a basic introduction to the topic of religious fraud, followed by a discussion of examples from major religious traditions. Stephen Kent will then extend the discussion to modern examples within sectarian groups. Phil Lord will conclude the presentation with a discussion of the legal treatment of religious fraud, highlighting several important cases.",

The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: Violent extremism is a growing worldwide problem that has received increased attention over the last twenty years, resulting in the advancement of knowledge on how people join, their involvement, and how they leave. An understudied area is people\u2019s experiences after they have left and are trying to reintegrate into mainstream society. Practitioners are often unequipped to assist in this transition, and tools are lacking to assess former extremists\u0027 psychosocial well-being and practical needs.\n\nKatharina Meredith, who studies violent extremism with Dr. John Horgan at Georgia State University, will present the findings of her Master\u2019s thesis on post-exit distress and coping. For the study, practitioners and former extremists were recruited for focus groups and interviews. A reflexive thematic analysis was used to summarize the topics and explore underlying themes. This resulted in an exploratory framework of post-exit distress and coping. Additionally, participants were invited back to provide feedback on the findings.\n\nThe post-exit distress framework includes dimensions such as mental health, emotions, physical health, daily life, legal matters, social relationships, exit and reintegration, safety, public image, identity, and worldview.\n\nThis exploratory study will lead to the development of a questionnaire and a follow-up study comparing former violent extremists and former cult members regarding post-exit distress and coping. Some of the themes found might already apply to former cult members, including \u0022feeling wired\u0022 (hypervigilance and the need to regulate stress levels after exiting), feeling disconnected from oneself and others, and the destabilizing nature of the initial years after leaving, characterized by internal and external chaos and uncertainty.",

The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: Ashlen Hilliard (she/her) will present her research conducted as part of the MSc Psychology of Coercive Control Program. Reproductive coercion interferes with an individual\u0027s rights and freedoms related to reproductive health decisions and decision-making to maintain power and control over the individual and prevent autonomy (Grace \u0026 Anderson, 2018). The accounts of those in cultic groups who experience a lack of reproductive autonomy are vital when reviewing existing definitions surrounding reproductive coercion. Existing understandings in the literature on reproductive coercion highlight that this particular form of coercion may be perpetrated by current or former intimate relationships, parents, or extended familial relationships (Grace \u0026 Anderson, 2018). However, in the context of those in cultic groups, the source of reproductive coercion may extend beyond an intimate relationship or family member. Potential sources of influence that may disrupt reproductive autonomy in cultic groups may include but are not limited to, the presence of a cult leader, cultural factors, or group ideological beliefs. Ashlen\u2019s research is the first exploratory analysis of the complex experiences of individuals who have experienced reproductive coercion while under the influence of a cultic or destructive group setting. Her research fills an identifiable gap in the literature by specifically studying how reproductive coercion manifests in destructive group settings, which has only been anecdotally alluded to from survivor accounts.",

The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: The lecture will start with a short review of previous lectures I gave about the nature of awe and the relationship between awe and the psychological state of fervor. What I didn\u0027t discuss previously is the counterintuitive subject of the causes of awe.\n\nThe most confusing aspect of awe experiences is that a person who experiences them can easily mistake what actually caused the experience with the conclusion that the person thinks the experience proves. For example, if a person sees a glass of water start to levitate, they might be filled with awe and conclude that a deity is sending them a message. What actually caused the awe experience is the levitating glass of water, but if you were to ask the person, they are likely to say that it was the presence of the deity that caused the glass to levitate, while the awe experience would just be seen as a side-effect.\n\nI will argue that awe comes about when people judge something as being sufficiently anomalous. Note that central to this claim is a person\u0027s judgment, meaning that there is nothing that is inherently awe-inspiring. It also means that almost anything can be thought of in a way that inspires awe. I will pay particular attention to the relationship between the causes and effects of awe and the sense of vastness (which is related to the vestibular sense, which has an interesting relationship with awe).\n\nBy understanding the causes of awe, we can see how people can be manipulated to feel awe, and more importantly, how cults can make sure that the potential recruit that they induce awe in comes to the \u0022correct\u0022 conclusion. After all, a levitating glass of water can psychologically \u0022prove\u0022 any faith.",

The speaker(s) of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: In recent years, the theory of identity fusion has been proposed to explain extreme behaviors conducted by people on behalf of a greater good, such as a group or a cause. This means that when individuals feel a sense of oneness with a group, they tend to prioritize the group\u0027s goals over their own well-being. Evidence has shown that strongly fused individuals are more likely to endorse extreme pro-group behaviors, such as being willing to fight for the group, volunteer for frontline combat, sacrifice their own lives, engage in morally questionable actions in support of the group, or accept violence in general. Researchers have explored the level of fusion individuals experience with various groups, including their country, sacred values, the military, their families, or political parties, among others. They have also studied how this fusion affects individuals\u0027 willingness to make costly sacrifices and engage in extreme behaviors in violent contexts, such as hooliganism and terrorism.\n\nInitially, it was hypothesized that abusive (or cultic) group members would have high levels of fusion. However, no empirical research to date has explored the role of this phenomenon in cults. The purpose of this study is to investigate how identity fusion with a group influences individuals not only to tolerate the abuse of other group members but also to have an inclination or willingness to perpetrate such abuse, particularly if they have previously been victims of it. To achieve this goal, we will compare how these phenomena manifest in both abusive and non-abusive religious groups. We expect to obtain results that help us better understand the violent dynamics that occur in cultic groups and may provide insights into whether it is necessary to implement certain strategies to reduce individuals\u0027 identity fusion in order to prevent group members from acting in ways that are unjust, illegal, or harmful to themselves or others.",

      "description": "Corpus, Habitus and Abuses in Religious Environment: A Debate on Cultural Identity and Victims\u2019 Silence - Tatiana Badaro\n-\nDisclaimer: This session was delivered for the 2023 ICSA Conference. The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: It is widely reported by Brazilian media the recurrence of abuses perpetrated by alleged religious leaders against their followers. Unfortunately, many of the cases find obstacles in the legal process itself due to a lack of technical information from the magistrates involved. This serious problem, which is a new violence against victims of undue influence, would be easily circumvented if a specialized analysis were requested to assist judges in their decisions.\n\nWhile Brazilian attention focuses on victimology to explain the phenomenon, it is important to discuss the modus operandi of groups based on undue influence. These groups reproduce the social imaginary that the collective is always right, leading to the logical conclusion that any negative result is attributed to a single subject. However, culture is formed by a broad corpus that implies a habitus that can lead to absurdities. In other words, it is not possible for a single person to be responsible for a social phenomenon such as Bolsonarism.\n\nBringing this reflection to the logic of victimology in cults of undue influence, it is not the victim who should suffer socio-legal scrutiny, but the group that perpetrated the violence. This leads to one more issue: there is a support network for the abusive leader that needs to be addressed at the academic and legal level.\n\nThis talk aims to debate Brazilian cultural identity that favors the silencing of victims and protects criminals, highlighting laws concerning cases of undue influence in religious environments. This study is part of a post-doctoral research at the Federal University of Bahia. The methodological course involved a broad bibliographic review about undue influence in religious circles, as well as documentary analysis of judicial decisions and cases shared by the Public Ministry of five Brazilian states in which the investigated processes took place.",

The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: In recent years, scientific evidence has accumulated on the elements that characterize different forms of interpersonal violence that can occur in intense, continuous, close relationships. The purpose of this study was to examine the similarities that exist between violence perpetrated in abusive groups, intimate partner violence, and the sexual exploitation of children and adolescents. First, these forms of interpersonal violence involve a severe power imbalance between a victim who is usually in a situation of vulnerability and a perpetrator who holds some kind of authority. This power imbalance makes victims relatively unable to defend their own interests and feel increasingly powerless, helpless, and even more vulnerable. Second, the recurrence and duration of interactions over time are key elements to understand the phenomenon. Violence is perpetrated on a continuous and systematic basis, which allows the process to be gradually intensified and fosters the normalization of the abusive situation. Third, interpersonal violence involves the implementation of a wide range of psychological, sexual, and physical abuse strategies that directly impact the victims by affecting their emotions, cognitions, and behaviors, or indirectly by controlling their immediate environment. Scholars have identified several strategies that can be perpetrated against cult followers, women in couples, and sexually exploited minors alike, such as isolation, intimidation and threats, manipulation of guilt, or the redefinition of reality. Fourth, the primary goal of interpersonal violence in close relationships is to obtain submission and broad dominance over the lives of the victims, rather than to cause damage or simply obtain obedience to specific orders. For perpetrators, domination may produce satisfaction associated with the achievement of power, as well as other benefits related to the labor, economic, or sexual exploitation of the victims. A conceptual model that highlights the parallelisms between these forms of interpersonal violence may be useful to better understand the phenomenon.",

(2) How do the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses organization and its doctrines impact the experiences of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses students attending secular higher education institutions? (3) How can educators help incorporate and support Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses students in secular higher education institutions?\n\nThe research questions will be addressed by conducting a series of three semi-structured interviews (Seidman, 2019) with five JW student participants who meet the sample criteria. Additionally, document analysis will be conducted on the JW organization\u0027s Watchtower Bible and Tract Society magazines and pamphlets, Awake and Watchtower. This proposed research study aims to contribute to the limited published research on JW students at secular higher education institutions and provide valuable insights for JW students making decisions about student services and programs. It also offers recommendations, strategies, and resources to educators and administrators seeking to support JW students.",

The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: Sexual violence is an experience of victimization shared by numerous North Americans. In the United States, one in five women and one in four men have been victims of attempted rape or rape during their lifetime (Smith et al., 2018). In a victimization survey, data shows that 81% of women and 43% of men recognize that they have experienced some form of sexual harassment and assault. In Canada, 39% of women and 35% of men have been sexually assaulted. Additionally, one in three (32%) women and one in eight (13%) men have experienced unwanted sexual behavior in public (Cotter and Savage, 2019). These statistics help us recognize that sexual violence is gender-based, and women are more likely than men to experience unwanted sexual violence in their lifetime. This can include diverse forms of sexual violence, from sexual harassment to sexual assault (Kelly, 1988).\n\nWhat is the situation of sexual violence in cultic contexts? Is this also a gender-based form of control? Is unwanted sexual behavior within a cultic group a reality as well? Can members freely give their sexual consent? How do members perceive behaviors that could be interpreted as sexual violence by outsiders? At what point in their trajectory does a former member recognize that what he or she experienced can be described as sexual violence?\n\nTo address these questions, we will analyze qualitative data from two sources: interviews and biographies. We will analyze thirty interviews with members and former members from various North American groups to comprehend their understanding of sexual violence within their community and their own experiences. To further our understanding, we will include former members\u0027 biographies, where they identified themselves as victims of sexual violence. Our results will aim to understand how sexual violence can be defined as a form of control over women\u0027s bodies.",

The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: This talk will explore three ways in which certain cultic strands have started to appear within a denominational church, the Church of England, in recent years. As a summary, I will give each of these three named cultic tendencies a two-word description - Binary Thinking, Narcissistic Exchange, and Artificial Community.\n\n1. Binary Thinking: Parts of the Church of England have increasingly aligned themselves with fundamentalist/binary ways of thinking. This black-white fundamentalist universe does not encourage imagination, wonder, or a sense of mystery. As a result, many CofE members are now deprived of spiritual creativity and the opportunity to deal with ambiguity and doubt.\n\n2. Narcissistic Exchange: There is an increasing tendency for CofE Christians to flock to large churches that require them to identify with and pour adulation on charismatic leaders. These leaders create a sense of power and excitement around them. On closer examination, we find a narcissistic bond between leaders and followers. This narcissistic feeding works in two directions. Leaders are encouraged in their grandiosity by uncritical worship of their charisma, while those who follow are fed with reassuring sermons about their salvation. However, there is little face-to-face pastoral support, and this narcissistic interdependency is ultimately unhealthy and sterile.\n\n3. Artificial Community: The need to belong is a strong motivation for people coming together. The community life offered by many \u0022successful\u0022 churches is strong on providing a sense of security and comfort but weak in addressing the true demands of maturity. Maturity encompasses conflict resolution and learning to live in a way that embraces differences.\n\nThe paper will conclude with a visual examination of church websites that illustrate each of these cultic tendencies.",

The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nThe resurgence of the cult of Simon Magus has found footing in the form of \u0022Deliverance Ministries\u0022 across the country, but particularly in the Appalachian mountain areas. These groups intertwine pseudo-psychiatric treatments popular in the 1970s, such as Neuro-Linguistic Programming and hypnotherapy, with existing treatments for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Practitioners claim that these treatments exorcise demonic presences in the lives of their clients. The overlay of Christian-based loaded language, combined with the popularity of current theological movements like the charismatic movement, helps fuel and create an environment for these practitioners to attempt to practice medicine without a license and prey upon victims of religious trauma who are seeking healing in those same charismatic Christian environments.\n\nThis paper will explore the forensic theological history of deliverance movements, their predominance in Appalachian mountain culture, their usage of manipulative psychotherapy frameworks disguised as punctuated exorcisms, an analysis of the clinical outcomes for individuals caught in the lucrative financial engine that these groups have designed, and recommendations for treatment and best practices for practitioners who are treating victims of these groups.",

These restrictions, however, have been progressively modified over the past twenty years. In this presentation, we will discuss the ways in which this group adapted during the COVID-19 pandemic, including how their stance toward modern technology underwent further alteration. Using qualitative data from first-hand accounts, we will look at how the PBCC was able to maintain many of their practices despite the significant alterations required to meet government requirements and how this was experienced by the members. We will also examine ways in which the PBCC is not only embracing the technologies they once avoided but is increasingly utilizing them as a means to further their separation from wider society.",

      "description": "Describing and Understanding Women\u0027s Experiences in Cultic Groups - Andrea Lagorse\n-\nDisclaimer: This session was delivered for the 2023 ICSA Conference. The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nThis talk will present the results of my master\u0027s thesis, which focuses on the specific experiences of women in a cultic context. Only a few studies have been carried out on this subject. Nevertheless, it seems that the cultic context provides an opportunity for leaders and the groups they have created to use psychological and sexual violence against women. Violence, gender inequalities, power relations, and stigmatization that women have suffered for decades in society are found in cultic contexts. These groups often maintain a patriarchal system that views women as inferior to men. It, therefore, seems relevant to look at women\u0027s experiences in cultic groups, especially in the Canadian social context, where women\u0027s rights are a central concern.\n\nThe main objective of this thesis was to identify the experiences of girls and women in cultic groups, with an emphasis on experiences of victimization, if applicable, based on the testimony of former members of such groups.\n\nUsing a qualitative methodology, eight in-depth life-story interviews were conducted with female former cult members. The participants\u0027 testimonies were analyzed from a feminist perspective, based on Stark\u0027s (2007) theory of coercive control.\n\nThe presented results show that women are subject to coercive control by the leader, which is reinforced by other members and sometimes by family members involved in the group. Participants are locked into roles that often stem from a patriarchal vision of women\u0027s place in society, forcing them to respond to the requirements of the leader and the community to whicxh they belong. Women also encounter difficulties when they leave the group, particularly in relation to seeking formal help. Considering the collected data, there is a real need for awareness, training, and research on understanding the specific cultic experiences of women to help them while respecting what they have experienced.",

      "description": "The Anti-Cult Movement in Russia - Dan Phillips, Tommy Valentine\n-\nDisclaimer: This session was delivered for the 2023 ICSA Conference. The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: \u0022Anti-cult\u0022 groups began to form in the 1970s in the United States in response to the perceived destructive nature of various new religious movements (NRM) (also known pejoratively as \u0022cults\u0022) that flourished in the 1960s. Parents, family members, and professionals of cults/NRM have since debated how cults/NRM should be viewed by society. Some have seen cults/NRM as destructive, and their members in need of saving through the use of techniques such as \u0022deprogramming.\u0022 However, there have been others who view the countermovement anti-cult groups as more destructive than those in the NRM themselves.\n\nSince the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, various parties in Russia have fought for legislation to ban religious groups that are seen as dangerous. The Russians have enacted legislation to prohibit various religious groups, such as the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, who were banned from Russia in 2017. Alexander Dvorkin has been on the frontline in the anti-cult movement in Russia. He is concerned that there exist destructive cults in Russia that attempt to control every aspect of their members\u0027 lives. Dvorkin wants individuals to have rights stronger than the rights of specific religious groups.\n\nThis presentation examines the post-Soviet anti-cult movement, the philosophy behind it, along with the major individuals and groups who are driving the anti-cult agenda. The Russian Orthodox Church, for instance, has supported the anti-cult movement, but there are other factors involved, not the least of which is Putin\u0027s desire to have the population united by one religion. Finally, Russia\u0027s anti-cult movement will be examined in the context of the Western anti-cult movement that occurred in the 1970s and 1980s in the United States.",

      "description": "You Should Write a Memoir! - Nori Muster\n-\nDisclaimer: This session was delivered for the 2023 ICSA Conference. The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: In 1997, Nori Muster published \u0022Betrayal of the Spirit,\u0022 a memoir about her ten years with the Hare Krishnas. For most of those years, she participated in covering up the organization\u0027s secrets. When she realized what was going on, she signed up for the UCLA Extension Writer\u0027s Program to learn how to tell the story. By the time she left the temple, she had a five-hundred-page doorstop of a manuscript. The final book was 213 pages.\n\nNori has been writing for publication since 1981 and will share what she\u0027s learned. The subjects include: how to decide what story you want to tell, what to include or leave out, the importance of your working title, how to obey slander and libel laws, where to seek feedback, when not to talk about your work, how to manage writer\u0027s block, whether to join a writing group or class, whether to publish, whether to self-publish, how to self-publish, how to write a memoir for future generations of your family, whether to use a pseudonym, how to choose a title, how to write a book proposal, and how to work with an agent or publisher.\n\nNori will present the information first and then open a group discussion. If you have ideas for writing a memoir or you\u0027re already in the process, this workshop will address your concerns. This workshop is designed to be inspirational, to help you get past the obstacles and on the road.\n\nYour goal may or may not include publishing, but simply putting your memories on paper is therapeutic because it helps get them out of your head. Reading and editing what you write helps you process your experiences. After the discussion, Nori will lead a writing exercise to brainstorm a title for your memoir.",

      "description": "The Cult of Troubled Teens - Melanie Friedman\n-\nDisclaimer: This session was delivered for the 2023 ICSA Conference. The speaker of this session does not speak on behalf of ICSA as an organization.\n-\nAbstract: My presentation will be about the troubled teen industry and its use of coercive control and thought reform as a form of \u0022treatment\u0022. This industry, which is mostly unregulated and unlicensed, manipulates desperate parents into thinking they will save children who are struggling with serious issues, including but not limited to trauma, neglect, learning disabilities, and severe mental health diagnoses. This industry utilizes coercive control and meets the same criteria as thought reform groups developed by Robert Jay Lifton. The aftermath for these children is devastating. Mental health professionals are often not trained in how to treat the survivors of this industry, and they just do not seem to fit in anywhere among survivor communities, or in the worst case, they unknowingly send clients to these programs for \u0022treatment\u0022. However, there is growing awareness through advocacy groups, and I\u0027d like to educate the cult community on how these survivors fit into the cult community and give them a voice and a place to belong. As a survivor of this industry and a mental health professional who is very passionate about working with cult survivors, I am excited to present this issue to my colleagues at the International Conference.",

Domestic abuse is now recognized as a widespread social problem   It is estimated that nearly half of all women and men will experience interpersonal aggression in a familial context during their lifetimes. This talk will suggest a connection between the power dynamic of domestic abuse, or as it is now often called, interpersonal violence, and the dynamic of coercive control in cultic groups.  I will present an overview of the stages and defining characteristics of coercive relationships, common to both domestic violence and cults. The talk will focus on Albert Biderman\u0027s eight coercive methods for eliciting compliance, including threats, degradation, trauma bonding, and isolation and how they manifest in both cults and domestic violence. Education to recognize and understand relationships of dominance and subjugation is the first line of defense against interpersonal violence of all types.",

      "description": "Generation Cult: Using New Media to Share Your Story (Dhyana Levey)\n\nPresentation at the International Cultic Studies Association annual conference in Manchester, UK in 2019. The public loves a good story and is especially interested in true tales about cults. Unfortunately, there\u2019s a lot of inaccurate information floating around about these high-demand, authoritarian groups. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for people who have had personal experiences with a variety of cults to share their stories. So, how does someone do that? Traditionally, writers have published books. Some are lucky enough to get a legitimate publisher, but that can be difficult, even more so now as that publishing industry has been in decline. But there are many other options now for people to share their stories. The internet and social media have become a very effective way to share information about cults, from online support groups to personal blogs to a simple confession on Facebook shared with your friends. Podcasts are an excellent way to learn about cults. There\u2019s one just called \u201CCults,\u201D another called \u201CWe\u2019re Starting a Cult,\u201D podcasts that just focus on a single cult like \u201CHeaven\u2019s Gate\u201D and then there\u2019s my own called \u201CGeneration Cult,\u201D that discusses people raised in high-demand groups. At first I thought traditional publishing was the only way to get my message to the public, but I learned how to make my own podcast and it wasn\u2019t that hard. Other people can do it, too. There are plenty of creative options out there now for former cult members to use to share their stories, they just have to know how to use them.",

      "description": "Developing the \u2018Totalistic Identity Theory\u2019 for cults and extremist groups\n(Rod Dubrow-Marshall, Ph.D.)\n\nResearch previously presented (Dubrow-Marshall and Martin 2008) has articulated the \u2018Totalistic Identity Theory\u2019 for cultic and extremist groups whereby it is advanced that members identity structures are largely dominated and fixed on the cult identity at the expense of many or all other levels and categories of identity and in a polarized or differentiated position in relation to other groups and society at large. This theory (Dubrow-Marshall 2007) is an extension of traditional social psychological theory on group identity (e.g. Turner\u2019s (1987) Self-Categorization Theory). Analysis of former cult members from the Wellspring Retreat and Resource Center in Ohio (Dubrow-Marshall \u0026 Martin 2008) has also shown a clear relationship between aspects of psychopathology and extent of identity with the group, thus providing evidence that a totalistic or polarized identity structure is harmful for group members.\nThis paper presents further analysis from the Wellspring sample advancing further a model for the specific psychopathology of former cult members. This analysis points to additional evidence for the \u2018Totalistic Identity Theory\u2019 and in particular aspects relating to the polarized identity position and its relationship to overall psychological well being and the perception by current group members of non-group members and the rest of the world and the behavioural correlates of such perceptions. The theory also points to and supports strategies for depolarization and de-identification with extremist groups and approaches to preventing initial recruitment to them.",

      "description": "Religious Conflict Resolution (Michael Langone, PhD.) \n\nResearch suggests that, in the West, hundreds of thousands of individuals join and leave\ncultic groups each year. Research studies also suggest that at least a sizable minority of\nthose who join cultic groups are adversely affected. The families of these group members,\nand probably many other families, tend to become concerned about their loved one\u2018s group\ninvolvement.\nRoughly 80 percent of the groups that cause concern are religious. The psychological,\npolitical, and occasionally commercial groups that aren\u2018t overtly religious often influence\nmembers\u2018 lives as though they were religions because they typically bring about a major\nshift in members\u2018 views of self, world, and other\u2014i.e., a conversion experience.\nDuring the past 25 years, most professionals who work with these families have emphasized\nhelping them persuade their loved ones to leave cultic groups. Exit counseling, a process\naimed at helping families create conditions under which their loved one will reevaluate a\ngroup involvement, has been very valuable to thousands of grateful families and group\nmembers. (Exit counseling is also often referred to as \u2015thought reform consultation.\u2016)\n\nNevertheless, only a very small percentage of families are able to proceed to an exit-\ncounseling intervention. In many cases, an intervention is not possible or even appropriate\n\nbecause the loved one\u2018s relationship to a group does not fit the typical pattern of\nexploitative manipulation associated with the subjects of exit-counseling interventions, even\nthough the family may have valid concerns. In other cases, the loved one may be so\nattached to the group (e.g., because of family ties within the group, decades of\ncommitment, fear of adjusting to the mainstream world) that his or her departure is\nunlikely, even with an intervention.\nVery little attention has been paid to this large majority of families for whom an exit\ncounseling is not feasible or appropriate. Livia Bardin\u2018s book, Coping with Cult Involvement:\nA Handbook for Families and Friends, offers some guidance. Ms. Bardin says that a cult\ninvolvement is often \u2015a situation to manage, not a problem to solve.\u2016\nThis talk will explore ways in which families can more effectively \u2015manage\u2016 a loved one\u2018s\ninvolvement in a group that causes concern, at least in part because of the nature of the\nconversion that it tends to bring about. The talk will approach the situation as a family\nconflict over what at least overtly are religious issues. Through lecture and discussion, the\nspeakers, a counseling psychologist, an educational/organizational consultant, and an exit\ncounselor (thought-reform consultant), will examine\n- How families and group members can come to better understand and appreciate\neach other\u2018s perspectives on the conflict that divides them.\n- How they can improve communication so as to reduce the level of conflict.\n- How they can negotiate mutual behavioral changes that will reduce the level of\nconflict.\n- How they can come to terms with the need to compromise so as to protect the love\nbetween them while respecting differences that divide them.",

      "description": "Reawakening Your Spirituality After a Cult Experience\n(Doug and Wendy Duncan)\n\nPresentation at the International Cultic Studies Association annual conference in Philadelphia, PA in 2018. Spiritual abuse is widespread and can be found in all religions. Cultic/spiritual abuse occurs when leaders use their position of authority to manipulate, control, and dominate. The cult leader portrays himself as the truth-bearer and members are led to believe that God has specifically chosen him to bring light into the world. The cult leader\u2019s claim that God has given him a unique and special revelation justifies his role as the leader and his right to exercise control over his members. Followers are taught to accept the leader\u2019s authority as divinely mandated. In whatever manner the abusive leader uses God, karma, salvation, the threat of damnation, the promise of enlightenment, or other spiritual promises/threats, the result is the same: spiritual abuse. Any doubts or questions are quickly extinguished by the leader utilizing intimidation, humiliation, and fear. Over time, the devotee adopts the cult\u2019s view of God and has difficulty leaving because of the fear that doing so means they are leaving \u201CThe Truth\u201D and even God himself. When an individual manages to separate from a cultic or spiritually abusive group, he faces myriad issues of a physical and psychological nature. Defining and reclaiming post-cult spirituality is often postponed while the individual sorts through day-to-day life outside the cult. However, acknowledging the damage and recapturing one\u2019s spiritual identity is a core task of recovery. How can we reawaken our spirituality? How do we fill that emptiness of the soul? How do we get past the feelings of confusion and disillusionment? How do we recapture a sense of purpose? This presentation will focus on:\n \nObstacles in transitioning out of a spiritually manipulative group/religion \nExpunging the image of the god of the cult \nRecovering your faith \nReconnecting with your spiritual self\u201D",

Unlike closed cult groups, ICSA firmly is committed to freedom of thought and expression. ICSA conferences provide an open arena for people from different backgrounds with diverse points of view. The speaker believes, in general, that dealing with conflicting viewpoints can be a healthy phenomenon. Dialogue expands our reality by helping us gain new insight into others as well as ourselves. In this presentation, the speaker will consider some factors that undermine ICSA\u2019s goal for dialogue among diverse groups and will suggest some ideas that might help members to connect. To understand the undermining factors, the speaker will focus upon the concept of transference and, also, upon the human tendency to stereotype those from groups that are different from their own. The speaker suggests that we should not let our expectation of others shape our reality. It is only possible to hear and learn from one another if there is a willingness to move past our assumptions. It helps to keep in mind the need to be humble, remembering that all are equals deserving of respect.",

      "description": "Panel: All Life is Suffering - Cultic Tendencies and Student Abuse in Buddhism (Christopher Hamacher [moderator]; Stuart Lachs; Tenzin Peljor)\n\nPresentation at the International Cultic Studies Association annual conference in Bordeaux, FR in 2017. This panel will attempt to cast a more realistic light on some of the less positive elements within the religion of Buddhism, which as a whole still tends to enjoy an unblemished, \u0022warm and fuzzy\u0022 standing in the public imagination. \n\n1. Ready to Mine: Zen\u2019s Legitimating Mythology and Cultish Behavior. Long-time practitioner and outspoken critic of Zen Buddhism Stuart Lachs will show how Zen\u0027s legitimating story and mythic history lays the groundwork for authoritarian-inclined charismatic leaders \u2012 called \u0022Zen masters\u0022 or roshi \u2012 to draw their followers into a world based on unquestioning obedience to the master, reliance on his approval, and an ethical framework dependent on his self-serving understanding. Though Zen presents its idealized masters as being fully in the world, spontaneous, and \u2012 most importantly \u2012 \u0022unattached\u0022, a state in which they are internally firm and free while remaining perceptually competent, this has hardly been the case in reality. Stuart will accordingly provide a number of examples of Asian and Western Zen masters who, along with their followers, have displayed cult-like behavior. Link to blog: https://buddhism-controversy-blog.com/2017/07/16/ready-to-mine-zens-legitimating-mythology-and-cultish-behavior/  \n\n2. Tibetan Buddhist monk Tenzin Peljor will explain how doctrinal issues and cross-cultural misunderstandings, for example about the concepts of faith and the guru in Tibetan Buddhism, can contribute to abusive spiritual systems. His review will begin with the highly controversial \u0022New Kadampa Tradition\u0022 and his own experiences with that movement, and then expand to other groups. Having run an online information portal about controversial Buddhist groups for many years, Tenzin can draw on numerous examples of suspect behavior from across the broad Buddhist spectrum. Link to PowerPoint: https://tenzinpeljor.de/PDF/ICSA2017.pdf \n\n3. How Zen Groups Respond to Allegations of Abuse. Zen teacher Christopher Hamacher will compare various Zen Buddhist groups from the perspective of how they have responded to abuse by their teachers. Based on a number of recent scandals, he will demonstrate how various Buddhist doctrines are invoked by the leaders and students, firstly to deny the abuse and/or refuse to intervene, and afterwards to deal \u0022compassionately\u0022 \u2012 i.e ineffectively \u2012 with the abuser. Christopher will then propose that, ultimately, the way a group reacts to allegations of misconduct may be a better indicator of its underlying dysfunction than the content of the allegations themselves.",

      "description": "Spiritual Issues in Counseling (Rev. Robert Pardon; Judy Pardon)\n2017\n\nSome apply the term spiritual abuse to any kind of psychological, physical, or sexual abuse that takes place in a religious context.  Others apply the term specifically to manipulations that damage a person\u0027s relationship to God or to his/her core self. Spiritual abuse has been reported in mainstream religious organizations as well as nonmainstream groups, such as cults.\n\nThe terms psychological abuse or emotional abuse refer to harms that overlap those associated with both of these conceptualizations of spiritual abuse. These harms include but are not limited to damaged self-esteem, induced dependency, impaired capacity to trust oneself or others, and emotional reactions such as anger, anxiety, and depression. In some cases, one\u0027s faith in God may also be shaken.\n\nTo a large degree, the choice of a term, psychological abuse or spiritual abuse, depends upon the framework (psychological or religious) with which the speaker/writer feels comfortable. This two-day conference finds value in resources coming from psychological and religious frameworks, though obviously some issues, e.g., questions about God\u0027s mercy, may require religious concepts to address properly. The conference is aimed at those who were spiritually abused, whether recently or in the past, family members concerned about a loved one, and helping professionals, including pastors and therapists.\n\nThe agenda will include the following topics:\n\nThe varieties of abuse\nCoping with triggers\nPersonal accounts of spiritual abuse\nPsychological issues in counseling\nSpiritual issues in counseling\nHow can churches and synagogues become spiritual safe havens\nSpiritual abuse victims dialogue with religious and mental health professionals\nOpen discussion",

These expectations carry severe consequences when not adhered to. While some groups suppress erotic development, others foster indiscriminate sexual activity creating an atmosphere that is inappropriately sexually charged and overstimulating. Anxiety surrounding sexuality may result in the sexual self becoming alienated. Messages instilled by the cult leader or belief system may continue in a person\u2019s psyche and body after a former member throws off the constricting cult norms and seeks to explore their own sexual potential. Learning to cope with these messages is necessary to be able to engage in healthy relationships. \n\nInsecure attachments characteristic of families in cults well as messages instilled by the cult often contribute to biological sexual dysfunction.

Each presentation will serve as a stimulus for questions and a discussion of clinical issues, which will occur during the following hour.\n\nDr Gillie Jenkinson will discuss the rationale for being informed by the Phases of Recovery and Growth when working with former cult members.

Individuals raised in cults may have never received appropriate medical care and may have many misconceptions about illness, doctors and medicine. This talk will explore how two second generation adult (SGA) former cult members overcame those barriers. You will hear from one SGA who become his own medical advocate and was able to form healing, therapeutic relationships with his medical team and doctors. The other speaker is an SGA who went to medical school after exiting the cult and has been a practicing family physician for 20 years. She will explore the issue from both perspectives and will specifically address stigmas attached to mental illness and psychiatric medicines.\n\nEva Mackey Meyrat, MD, is a second-generation adult former cult member and a facilitator of the ICSA CT Workshop for Those Born or Raised in Cultic Groups. Her mother became a devotee of an Indian guru in 1975 when she was one year old. He taught a branch of Hinduism called Advaita Vedanta, a non-dualistic philosophy which teaches that the self is one with the ultimate truth or reality. Half of Eva\u2019s childhood was spent in the ashram in India, where she and the other children were unsupervised much of the time. Despite the upheavals and instability that characterized her childhood, Eva managed to get out of the cult at the age of 16 and eventually earned her MD degree from the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. Dr. Mackey has a busy family practice, and she lives near Dallas with her husband and four children.\n\nCk Rardin, facilitator, ICSA CT Workshop for Those Born or Raised in Cultic Groups, was born in California. His parents raised him in a cultic Catholic group and when he reached adolescence, they signed over their parental rights to the group. Ck was then sent to the cult\u2019s headquarters in Itaquera, Sao Paulo, Brazil. He stayed in the group till age 26 when he gathered the courage and strength to leave the organization on his own. After leaving he became a certified EMT, then was certified and joined the American Society of Clinical Pathologists (ASCP ), with which he maintains his certification. He now runs his own IT consulting firm in upstate New York and spends much of his time involved in recovery from his experience, working to expose these groups (for example, assisting in research for MTV\u2019s production of The Cult Question) as well as helping others in their recovery.",

After they leave the cult, they may bring these beliefs and character traits with them. S/MGAs can discover that attitudes shaped within the cult might be impeding their present life. For example, in the cult, they were expected to reach perfection. This belief causes them to struggle with internalized pressure to be perfect after they leave. When S/MGAs fail at perfection, they typically might feel depressed or filled with shame. S/MGAs also might experience symptoms of C-PTSD, such as hypervigilant or hypovigilent (dissociative) behavior. Additionally, S/MGAs typically struggle with complicated emotions about their parents in the cult, and they might be uncertain about how to deal with their feelings after they leave the cult. Finally, the presenters will explore how post-cult relationships and therapy might aid former cult members.\n\nLorna Goldberg, LCSW, PsyA, Board Member and Past President of ICSA, is a clinical social worker and psychoanalyst in private practice and Director at the Institute of Psychoanalytic Studies.

She has cochaired ICSA\u2019s Mental Health Committee, published numerous articles in professional journals about her therapeutic work with former cult members, and contributed chapters to several important texts on psychotherapy and cults.

Lesbian and gay individuals who grow up in religious cults can face opposition and condemnation based on the individual\u2019s affectional/sexual orientation. This opposition may come from religious doctrines and teachings, cult/church leaders, and even from family members. As a result of this opposition and condemnation, LGB individuals may struggle with depression, anxiety, drug/alcohol abuse, self-mutilation, and suicidal ideation. The researcher will describe the lived experiences of LGB individuals who grew up in fundamental religious organizations/cults that have subsequently left these groups and discuss best counseling practices to work with these individuals, based on experience and research.\n \nAfter this session participants will be able to:\n1. Participants will gain an understanding of the collective experiences of former cult members who identify as LGB\n2.

This is not a \u201Cfun\u201D book. Nor is it a book that aims to validate feelings of anger, hurt, helplessness, and fear, although it does that to some extent. This book is a handbook, a tool designed to help you achieve a goal, namely, to help a loved one. As with all tools, the book requires effort to learn how to use it. It is not something that you merely read. It is something that you use, something that you wrestle with, that you come back to again and again.\n\nIf you are willing to give the requisite time and mental exertion that this book demands, I am confident that you will find it to be extremely helpful. It may not solveyour problem, for, as Mrs. Bardin states in the Introduction, a cult involvement is often a situation to manage, not a problem to solve. The book will, however, make you confident that you are doing all that you realistically can to manage, if not solve, the problem that has caused you so much distress.\n\nAbout the Author:\nLivia Bardin, MSW, is a clinical social worker who has been engaged with cult victims and their families for more than fifteen years. She is particularly interested in the interface between high-demand groups and cults and mainstream society. Her research in this area has been published in the Cultic Studies Review and the Journal of Public Child Welfare. Now retired, Ms. Bardin has provided training on cult-related issues for mental health professionals in the Washington area and elsewhere, She is the author of Coping with Cult Involvement: A Handbook for Families and Friends of cult members. In 2014 Ms. Bardin received ICSA\u0027s Margaret T. Singer Award.",

Each month will feature a different clinician discussing some aspect of clinical work. Each presentation will serve as a stimulus for questions and a discussion of clinical issues, which will occur during the following hour.\n\nDaniel Shaw LCSW will discuss his clinical approach to working with cult survivors. His approach is based on more than 25 years of experience as a psychoanalyst, and on his own experience of 13 years living and working in the ashram of a guru he came to see as a cult leader. He will discuss the importance of psycho-education, about the psychology of the cult leader, and about the effects on survivors of trauma. His approach emphasizes the importance of self-compassion, the antidote to self-alienation, through the use of self-reflection and self-regulation skills.\n\nAfter completing this webinar, participants will be able to:\n1. Define self-alienation and identify the symptoms of self-alienation in cult survivors. \n2. Identify the psychopathology of the traumatizing narcissist, including their specific abusive behaviors that negatively impact the functioning of cult survivors.\n3. Educate cult-survivor clients to develop self-reflection and affect regulation skills in their process of trauma recovery. \n\nBibliography:\nBenjamin, J. (1998).

This talk will focus on how unhealthy Christian churches may cultivate an environment for spiritual abuse to thrive, the role controlling theology can play in creating a high-pressure environment, and conclude with questions you can raise about a group to help evaluate spiritual abuse, the potential for it, or if high-control scenarios already exist.

Children will dissociate from their emotional reactions to abuse or neglect in an attempt to protect themselves and survive in the face of overwhelming anxiety. Dissociation allows them to continue to rely on a frightening or abandoning adult. Children defend themselves further by identifying with their perpetrator\u0027s attitude. The cult leader or parent reinforces this attitude by creating a punitive and shaming world for the child. Living in such a harsh reality has numerous ramifications for the character of SGA/MGAs. SGA/MGAs continue to struggle with their harsh conscience after they leave the cult. To help, therapists can provide a compassionate and respectful environment where former cult members gain a broader sense of reality by connecting the present to the past. \n\nOverview of series:\nThis series is specifically for second and multi-generational adult former cult members, however, this is going to be the first program for S/MGAs that is open to all.

Viewers will learn the difference between healthy and unhealthy attachment patterns. The cult involved parent is likely to display unhealthy attachment patterns which will negatively impact the child. Erickson\u2019s eight developmental stages will be reviewed with an emphasis on how they may not be successfully complete by children in cults. Children develop survival strategies in response the unhealthy caregiver and environment. These strategies, while necessary for the child, may create problems as the child grows into an adult. These problems include but are not limited to the following: Problems with the development of a unique identity and sense of self. 2. Trouble with affect regulation and inability to self-soothe. Those who were raised in cults often struggle with anxiety and depression. 3. Trouble with setting and maintaining healthy boundaries. 4.

But we see the increasing need for those outside of this population to learn about the unique recovery issues relevant to S/MGAs.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nEva Mackey Meyrat, MD, is a second-generation adult former cult member. Her mother became a devotee of an Indian guru in 1975 when she was 1 year old. He taught a branch of Hinduism called Advaita Vedanta; a non-dualistic philosophy which teaches that the self is one with the ultimate truth or reality. Half of Eva\u2019s childhood was spent in the ashram in India, where she and the other children were unsupervised much of the time. Despite the upheavals and instability that characterized her childhood, Eva managed to get out of the cult at the age of 16 and eventually earned her MD degree from the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.

Regardless of the primary focus of a particular cult (e.g. religious, political, therapeutic, philosophical, etc.) practically everyone who has been in one experienced feelings and reactions that were common to most cult encounters. These reactions and experiences were the predictable results of the group dynamics and manipulations common to all cults, even though their cult may have offered a self-serving mystical or magical explanation for them. For the initial presentation in this recovery workshop, the presenter will describe some common experiences of second-and multi-generation cult members (SGA\u0027s/MGA\u0027s). The goal of this presentation is to help the participants to define and describe these experiences as well as to consider non-mystical explanations for them.\n\nOverview of series:\nThis series is specifically for second and multi-generational adult former cult members, however, this is going to be the first program for S/MGAs that is open to all. In the past, ICSA workshops for this population have been limited to those who were themselves born or raised in cults. But we see the increasing need for those outside of this population to learn about the unique recovery issues relevant to S/MGAs.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nBill Goldberg, LCSW, PsyA, is a clinical social worker and psychoanalyst with more than forty years\u2019 experience working with former cult members. He and his wife, Lorna, colead a support group for former cult members, which has been meeting for more than forty years. It is the oldest group of its kind in the world. In 2007, Bill retired from the Rockland County, New York Department of Mental Health, where he directed several programs and clinics. He is presently an adjunct professor in the Social Work and Social Science departments of Dominican College, and he is on the faculty of the Institute for Psychoanalytic Studies. Bill has published numerous articles in books and professional journals and is a frequent speaker at ICSA conferences. Among other awards, in 2010, Bill was the recipient of ICSA\u2019s Lifetime Achievement Award. He is also coeditor of ICSA\u0027s Cult Recovery: A Clinician\u0027s Guide to Working With Former Members and Their Families, published in 2017.",

Carli McConkey was 21 years old when she happened upon New Age guru, Natasha Lakaev, and her personal development company, Life Integration Programmes, at the Mind Body Spirit Festival in Sydney, Australia in 1996. What at first appeared professional and promising, became a vehicle for psychological and physical abuse. Over the next thirteen years, Carli lost her freedom\u2026her mind\u2026and her family. This memoir demonstrates the subtle and insidious process of mind control, gives insights into the period of recovery after escape, and shows how determination and strength can overcome adversity.\u0022 You can purchase her book here: https://www.amazon.com/Cult-Effect-Story-Control-Australia-ebook/dp/B074DFJ3BH#:~:text=The%20Cult%20Effect%20is%20an,absolutely%20never%20signed%20up%20for.\n \nAbout the Author\n\u0022Carli McConkey spent over 13 years in a destructive cult from the age of 21 to 35 and escaped in January, 2010. She says \u0027escape\u0027, because she was brainwashed into believing that she could not leave. If she did, either her three children would be taken from her, or she and her family would die in Armageddon, prophesised by the cult leader for December 2012. Carli is a normal, everyday person, who is intelligent and from a loving family, and yet she found herself in this situation. Carli wishes to help educate family and friends of current and former cult members so that they are better able to understand the process of mind control and support their loved ones through recovery. She also hopes that sharing her story, personal insights and triumphs, will help support fellow ex-cult members and prevent others from falling prey to such predators. Carli completed a BA (Communication), majoring in Organisational Communication and Public Relations, at Charles Sturt University, Bathurst, in 1995. She has been rebuilding her career since leaving the cult, working as an Executive Assistant. Carli lives in Sydney with her three children.\u0022",

Muster joined the International Society of Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON)--the Hare Krishnas--in 1978, shortly after the death of the movement\u0027s spiritual master, and worked for ten years as a public relations secretary and editor of the organization\u0027s newspaper, the ISKCON World Review. In this candid and critical account, Muster follows the inner workings of the movement and the Hare Krishnas\u0027 progressive decline.\nCombining personal reminiscences, published articles, and internal documents, Betrayal of the Spirit details the scandals that beset the Krishnas--drug dealing, weapons stockpiling, deceptive fundraising, child abuse, and murder within ISKCON\u2013as well as the dynamics of schisms that forced some 95 percent of the group\u0027s original members to leave. In the midst of this institutional disarray, Muster continued her personal search for truth and religious meaning as an ISKCON member until, disillusioned at last with the movement\u0027s internal divisions, she quit her job and left the organization.\n\nIn a new preface to the paperback edition, Muster discusses the personal circumstances that led her to ISKCON and kept her there as the movement\u0027s image worsened. She also talks about \u0022the darkest secret\u0022\u2013child abuse in the ISKCON parochial schools--that was covered up by the public relations office where she worked. \nhttps://www.amazon.com/Betrayal-Spirit-Headlines-Krishna-Movement/dp/0252065662\n\nAbout Nori:\nNori Muster is a journalist, researcher, and artist based in Arizona. She earned her Master of Science degree at Western Oregon University studying creative art therapy. She started writing full time for publication in 1981, and published Betrayal of the Spirit, a memoir, in 1997.\nNori has written two follow-up books, Child of the Cult and Cult Survivor\u0027s Handbook. She writes journal articles on the subject, is a spokesperson to the media, and a regular presenter at International Cultic Studies Association (ICSA) conferences.\n\nNori wrote her own I Ching (Learning to Flow with the Dao), and her own positive thinking book (Dreaming Peace), for people in the post-9/11 world. She also published Positive Quotations, gathered during her research for Dreaming Peace.",

      "description": "Terror, Love, \u0026 Brainwashing: Attachment in Cults and Totalitarian Systems\u0022\nInterview with Alexandra Stein by Joseph Szimhart\n \n\u0022Written by a cult survivor and renowned expert on cults and totalitarianism, Terror, Love and Brainwashing draws on the author\u2019s 25 years of study and research to explain how almost anyone, given the right set of circumstances, can be radically manipulated to engage in otherwise incomprehensible and often dangerous acts.\n \nIllustrated with compelling stories from a range of cults and totalitarian systems, from religious to political to commercial, the book defines and analyses the common and identifiable traits that underlie almost all these groups. It focuses on how charismatic, authoritarian leaders control their followers\u2019 attachment relationships via manipulative social structures and ideologies so that, emotionally and cognitively isolated, they become unable to act in their own survival interests. Using the evolutionary theory of attachment to demonstrate the psychological impact of these environments, and incorporating the latest neuroscientific findings, Stein illustrates how the combined dynamic of terror and \u2018love\u2019 works to break down people\u2019s ability to think and behave rationally. From small local cults to global players like ISIS and North Korea, the impact of these movements is widespread and growing.\n \nThis important book offers clarity and a unique perspective on the dynamics of these systems of control, and concludes with guidance to foster greater awareness and prevention. It will be essential reading for mental health professionals in the field, as well as policy makers, legal professionals, cult survivors, and their families, as well as anyone with an interest in these disturbing groups. Students of social and developmental psychology will also find it fascinating.\u0022\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Terror-Love-Brainwashing-Attachment-Totalitarian/dp/1138677973",

For over a decade, gossip swirled around northern Utah that a secretive group of religious zealots were buying up homes to take over a developing neighborhood in an Ogden community. The homes were known far and wide for their immaculately landscaped yards. Rumors spread that a well-known landscaper in the city had proclaimed himself to be a prophet of god and was being commanded to start his own secret religion that promoted polygamy. It was also believed these extremists were stockpiling weapons as part of their doomsday beliefs. In reality, the leader was directing some of the most repugnant crimes against women and children ever seen in the state. The hidden atrocities of the cult may never have been discovered if not for the courage of one of its members. Thirty years later, victims reconnected with each other and with the lead investigator to address the shortcomings of the criminal justice system regarding child victims.\n\nYou can purchase \u0022Deceived\u0022 here: https://www.profilingevil.com/store/p/zionsociety",

By the time her older brother was ten, Lisa\u0027s father had him smoking pot. By the time Lisa was ten, Lisa\u0027s mother had them pledging their lives to the Unification Church (the \u0022Moonies\u0022) and self-appointed Messiah, Reverend Sun Myung Moon. As a child Lisa knew the ecstatic comfort of inclusion in a cult and as a teenager the torment of rebelling against it. As an adult, Lisa struggled to break free from the hold of abuse and the scars in her heart, mind, and psyche--battling her own addictions and inner demons and searching her soul for a sense of self-worth. Told in spirited candor, to the moon and back reveals how one can leave behind absurdity and horror and create a life of intention and joy. \n\nAbout the Author: The best seats Lisa Kohn ever had at Madison Square Garden were at her mother\u0027s wedding, and the best cocaine she ever had was from her father\u0027s friend, the judge. Lisa was raised in a religious cult (the Moonies) with her mom and in a life of \u0022sex, drugs, and squalor\u0022 in New York City\u0027s East Village in the 1970s with her dad. Lisa is now a teacher and public speaker who owns a leadership consulting and executive coaching firm and who works to bring to others the tools, mind-shifts, and practices she\u2019s found that have helped her heal from her crazy, mixed-up childhood.\nYou can read more at her website, www.lisakohnwrites.com, where you can also download the first chapter of her book, watch and read Lisa\u2019s interviews in media such as Megyn Kelly Today, Daily Mail, Marie Claire, and hear her podcast interviews for IndoctrNation, Generation Cult, and Lionrock. Lisa will always tell you that she is a native New Yorker, but she currently lives in Pennsylvania with her husband and two children, whenever they\u2019re around.

      "description": "Psycho-Social Aspects of Belief in Conspiracy Theories (Bill Goldberg, LCSW, PsyA)\n\nMore than any other time in recent history, conspiracy theories have contaminated political thinking in this country. Bizarre theories and explanations for current events, both real and imagined, have become an acceptable part of our public dialogue; and some political leaders have given credence to speculations about the motivations of opponents that would once have been viewed as embarrassingly ludicrous.  In this lecture and conversation, we will explore this phenomenon from a psychoanalytic viewpoint. We will discuss the historical antecedents of today\u0027s conspiracy theories and the factors in the Information Age that make it unique. We will also discuss developmental and defensive factors that render otherwise intelligent individuals susceptible to conspiracy theories. \n\nLearning Objectives:\n\n1.

      "description": "\u0022Traumatic Narcissism: Relational Systems of Subjugation\u0022\nInterview with Daniel Shaw by Joseph Szimhart\n\nIn this volume, Traumatic Narcissism: Relational Systems of Subjugation, Daniel Shaw presents a way of understanding the traumatic impact of narcissism as it is engendered developmentally, and as it is enacted relationally. Focusing on the dynamics of narcissism in interpersonal relations, Shaw describes the relational system of what he terms the \u0027traumatizing narcissist\u0027 as a system of subjugation \u2013 the objectification of one person in a relationship as the means of enforcing the dominance of the subjectivity of the other. Daniel Shaw illustrates the workings of this relational system of subjugation in a variety of contexts: theorizing traumatic narcissism as an intergenerationally transmitted relational/developmental trauma; and exploring the clinician\u0027s experience working with the adult children of traumatizing narcissists. He explores the relationship of cult leaders and their followers, and examines how traumatic narcissism has lingered vestigially in some aspects of the psychoanalytic profession. Bringing together theories of trauma and attachment, intersubjectivity and complementarity, and the rich clinical sensibility of the Relational Psychoanalysis tradition, Shaw demonstrates how narcissism can best be understood not merely as character, but as the result of the specific trauma of subjugation, in which one person is required to become the object for a significant other who demands hegemonic subjectivity. Traumatic Narcissism presents therapeutic clinical opportunities not only for psychoanalysts of different schools, but for all mental health professionals working with a wide variety of modalities. Although primarily intended for the professional psychoanalyst and psychotherapist, this is also a book that therapy patients and lay readers will find highly readable and illuminating.\n\nAbout the Author:\nDaniel Shaw, LCSW is a psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapist in private practice in New York City, and in Nyack, New York. He is a training analyst, teacher and supervisor of analytic candidates at the National Institute for the Psychotherapies in New York City.

      "description": "\u0022Whispering in the Daylight: The Children of Tony Alamo Christian Ministries and Their Journey to Freedom\u0022\nInterview with Debby Schriver by Joseph Szimhart\n\nBeginning in the 1960s in California, erstwhile music producer Tony Alamo became interested in authoritarian religion and, along with his charismatic wife, Susan, began gathering followers. By the 1970s, Tony Alamo Christian Ministries had established particularly strong footholds in Arkansas, as well as maintaining outposts in California. The ministry gained a legion of followers, with branches not only in the USA but in places as diverse as Africa and Sri Lanka. Even through their leader\u2019s eventual imprisonment under federal charges (related to transporting minors across state lines for sexual purposes), Alamo\u2019s vision survived\u2014and his community survives him today.\n\nWhispering in the Daylight: The Children of Tony Alamo Christian Ministries and Their Journey to Freedom is based on numerous interviews from group members and, more importantly, on interviews with the children\u2014second and third-generation followers. Author Debby Schriver chronicles how this group was formed, documenting its many abuses and its gradual adoption of cult-like behaviors and practices. Like many cult leaders, Tony Alamo had different faces. The public saw him as a somewhat self-important but harmless music promoter and designer of bedazzling denim jackets. Schriver chronicles firsthand the condemnation, rejection, and torment that the second-generation survivors of Tony Alamo\u2019s abuses experienced. Schriver\u2019s interviews, particularly those with children, illuminate the real horrors of the Alamos\u2019 behavior, ranging from economic exploitation, extreme forced fasts, and beatings, that resulted in permanent injury.\n\nSchriver\u2019s extensive research\u2014including interviews with Tony Alamo himself, harrowing visits to Alamo compounds, and witnessing gut-wrenching confrontations between freed children and their unreformed parents\u2014tells the story of a closed group whose origins and history are unlikely ever to be definitively unraveled.\n\nAbout the Author:\nDEBBY SCHRIVER has spent her career working with students, parents, and staff in the departments of student life and employee training and development at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. She is the author of In the Footsteps of Champions: The University of Tennessee Lady Volunteers, the First Three Decades, coauthor, with Jenny Moshak, of Ice \u2019n\u2019 Go: Score in Sports and Life, and coeditor, with Lucia McMahon of To Read My Heart: The Journal of Rachel Van Dyke, 1810\u20131811.\n\nYou can purchase Debby\u0027s book here: https://www.amazon.com/Whispering-Daylight-Children-Christian-Ministries/dp/1621903869",

Moderated by Ashlen Hilliard, ICSA\n\nA year ago Phil Elberg, former president of ICSA and winner of the first Margaret Singer Award for Advancing the Understanding of Coercive Influence spoke at a meeting of ICSA\u2019s New York Chapter. For the first time in a public forum Phil told the story of how while looking into a case in his law office against the leader of a drug rehabilitation program led by Miller Newton, he made the cultic connection to his sister\u2019s involvement with an abusive cult leader, Fred Newman, and how making that connection led to his success in exposing the cultic nature of Kids and Straight, Inc.  Phil\u2019s fascinating and moving talk included a discussion of his advocacy work in the troubled teen industry and other cultic groups including NXIVM and focused from the perspective of a practicing lawyer what \u201Ccult law\u201D is and is not.  It concluded with a discussion of the legal issues that people concerned about cults focus on.\n\n\u0022Keeping a family member from joining a toxic group;\nGetting them out if they are in;\nOnce they are in preventing a loved one from turning over financial assets \nAttempting to speak out about a cultic group (particularly on the internet) after leaving as part of the healing process and with the goal of helping others;\nSuing the group or its leaders for economic and emotional damages arising from cult involvement;\nDealing with family court issues of custody and visitation when one parent remains and one leaves;  \nUsing proof of brainwashing to excuse criminal conduct, mitigate a criminal penalty or convince prosecutors to pursue a prosecution of a group or its leader.\u0022\n\nICSA has decided to make Phil\u2019s talk available on the internet as a stimulus presentation and to then provide an interactive discussion with Phil Elberg, Bill Goldberg, Pat Ryan, and Joseph Kelly moderated by Ashlen Hilliard in which legal and related issues associated with these topics can be discussed.\n\nPhil Elberg, Esq. \u2013 pelberglaw@gmail.com \n\nWilliam Goldberg, LCSW, PsyA \u2013 bill@blgoldberg.com \n(blgoldberg.com)\n\nPat Ryan \u2013 pryan19147@gmail.com  \nJoseph Kelly -- joekelly411@gmail.com \n(CultNews101.com)\n(Cults101.org)\n(CultMediation.com): \n(Intervention101.com)\n(CultRecovery101.com)",

With a solid background in the entertainment field, he proposes that art is the antidote to thought reform. His presentation will encompass the mechanics of undue influence and cultic dynamics focusing on coercive institutionalized persuasion. His hope is to reach younger audiences as they enter careers in psychology and other social sciences. He works to create and promote media to illustrate the common dynamics of high-control groups wherever they appear: in the teen-treatment related programs, in religious failure, in strife at home, and as part of the US court system. Part of a larger plea for increased individual awareness, Zack Bonnie\u0027s mission is to educate the public - through the arts - about the systems applied in these institutions.",

      "description": "Former Member Guilt and the Path to Self-Forgiveness (Nori Muster, Lorna Goldberg)\n\nWhen individuals join a dangerous cult, they unconsciously adopt the group\u2019s negative habits. Certain assumptions in the group\u2019s \u201Cperfect\u201D dogma contribute to this process, for example, leaders might openly profess \u201Canything is allowed if it\u2019s done for god,\u201D \u201Cthe guru said it\u2019s okay, so it\u2019s okay,\u201D and \u201Cthe laws of man do not apply to us because we dedicated ourselves to god.\u201D To prove themselves loyal, new recruits quickly learn to repress their gut feelings and rightly-felt doubts. Authoritarian groups operate under a \u201Cno talk\u201D rule, where it is considered a grave sin to acknowledge shortcomings in the hierarchy. For example, in ISKCON, the Krishna consciousness organization, they called it \u201Cblasphemy of a pure devotee\u201D to speak about anything the gurus did wrong. Meanwhile, gurus notoriously did dishonest things and involved followers in unethical behavior that would make any normal person feel shame. Gurus then use this shame to manipulate followers. While under the spell of the group, even good, honest people who join may internalize the attitudes of arrogance and denial. They may never uncover any reason to feel guilt. However, most often, former members who took part in crimes and abuses do feel guilt after they leave. Ex-members\u2019 guilt may be overly harsh, due to internalizing cult leaders\u2019 punitive and uncompassionate attitudes. In this presentation, Nori Muster will discuss her personal struggle overcoming post-cult guilt, and Lorna Goldberg and Nori will discuss reasons why former members may hold onto or deny the guilt they feel. Lorna will share self-forgiveness tools to help ex-members reframe their experiences, reduce their self-punishing attitudes, and free themselves from their groups once and for all.",

      "description": "Parent to Parent: Keeping Your Teen Safe and Prevention Before Recruitment: Where do we Begin? (Robin Boyle-Laisure and Andrea Laisure)\n\nThis talk will address various forms of harmful relationships affecting pre-teens, teenagers, and young adults. Attempts to lure minors and young adults into organizations take the form of religious or non-religious cults, with college campuses as vulnerable sites for recruitment. International human trafficking rings, have become increasingly difficult to police. Furthermore, as detailed in Rachel Lloyd\u0027s book, Girls Like Us, teenagers are often targets of commercial sexual exploitation. In addition, are incidents of one-on-one abuse between teens within romantic relationships. Previously depicted as \u0022\u0022domestic violence\u0022\u0022 among adults, there can be similar harmful dynamics between teenagers. In Part I of my talk, I would focus on how undue influence plays a role in the following: - Recruitment into cults; (many speakers will address this, so this would be short) - Recruitment into human trafficking rings; - Commercial sex industry; and - Abusive one-on-one romantic relationships. And Part II would be - how to talk to your pre-teen and teenager to prevent these relationships from forming; - warning signs for parents about abusive relationships their children may be having; - suggested ways to handle if you\u0027ve suspected a dangerous relationship; and - where to turn for help.\n\n\nPrevention Before Recruitment: Where do we Begin? \n\nAlexandra Stein \n\nIn 1952, Solomon Asch, the great social psychologist and scholar of social influence, wrote: \u201CThe greater man\u2019s ignorance of the principles of his social surroundings, the more subject is he to their control; and the greater his knowledge of their operations and of their necessary consequences, the freer he can become with regard to them.\u201D Unfortunately, there has been little progress in the 21st century on developing public education to remedy this ignorance of controlling social influence mechanisms and thereby increase resistance in the general population to recruitment to cults and extremist groups. This paper will examine why this might be so, and propose what steps can be taken to increase knowledge of social influence to strengthen this resistance. I will suggest that prevention of both cult involvement and radicalization to extremism requires teaching people, in an ideologically neutral way, specifically about totalist groups and relationships including the methods, structures and likely outcomes of such involvements. Current prevention efforts on extremism tend to be targeted at those already recruited, or at least exposed to recruitment attempts. I will suggest that we must start much earlier in the process and reinforce this education at all levels of learning. Educators and policy makers can contribute to this effort by drawing on the rich history of research in the social and psychological sciences that has accumulated over the past 70 years, along with contemporary scholarship.",

Known as the \u201CCritical Thinker at Large\u201D to nearly 15,000 YouTube subscribers, Chris has been producing video content from Denver, CO since 2014. Following his exit in 2012 from Scientology\u2019s management group, the Sea Organization, Chris cultivated the specialized communication and organizational skills he developed through various roles in Scientology\u2019s management group, the Continental Liaison Office of the Western United States. Chris was a second-generation Scientologist, brought into the group at age three by his parents in California, and began working for Scientology after completing high school. After nearly 25 years of membership, Chris left Scientology. Motivated to expose his experiences in Scientology and to educate the general public on the beliefs, policies, practices, and dangers of the group, Chris published Scientology: A to Xenu (Graphicwerks, 2014), has produced dozens of solo broadcasts, has interviewed more than 100 guests for video and his \u201CSensibly Speaking\u201D podcast, edits the interviews and promotes them through social media channels. Chris appeared on Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath (A\u0026E, 2017) in Season One, Special Episode One. Three strong influences in his post-Scientology recovery include Carl Sagan\u0027s The Demon Haunted World, James Randi, skeptic.com, and Michael Shermer, who contributed to the reshaping of his worldview and his desire to promote critical thinking and reason as a counter to undue influence and thought reform techniques. Just one of Chris\u2019s near future goals includes university studies in undue influence and anti-extremism.",

      "description": "Applying Cultural Competency to Work with Former Cult Members (Matthew Staton, MDiv Counseling)\n\nHow can we improve competence in counseling clients emerging from coercive religious backgrounds? Training and conceptual models for use with this specific population are scarce. However, research and anecdotal evidence indicate that each coercive group (broadly defined, a cult) creates its own culture, complete with a unique body of knowledge, morality, rules, literature, and terminology. This culture so shapes its adherents that second-generation adults often feel like third-culture kids when assimilating into mainstream culture after exiting the cult. A question we often encounter in our online cult-recovery groups is whether anyone can recommend a local counselor who \u201Cgets it\u201D \u2014 that is, someone who understands how deeply the cult\u0027s teachings are ingrained and can help them overcome the conditioned responses that inhibit their assimilation into society outside the cult. In this session, we will address the vacuum that exists for counselors working with this population by building on the premise that a cult is a culture. Approaching a cult as a culture provides counselors with an opportunity to apply their existing cultural competence. It also implies possible challenges for the client that might not otherwise be obvious in communicating between the cult and mainstream culture. We will use the knowledge and skills related to cultural competence in general to suggest interventions for working with those who have experienced abusive spiritual systems.",

After 23 years and a suicide attempt, she began attending college (in spite of the group\u2019s ban on higher education). After 3 years, at 43 years old, she made the decision to \u201Cdisassociate\u201D from the group, essentially ex-communicating herself.

      "description": "Ready to Mine: Zen\u0027s Legitimating Mythology and Cultish Behavior (Stuart Lachs)\n\nZen Buddhism was the first of Eastern religions to gain wide acceptance in the West post WWII. It was accepted mostly uncritically by artists and intellectuals alike. However, beginning in the 1970\u2019s, the most prominent Zen groups in America were wracked by scandal. In spite of these repetitive scandals caused by the sexual abuse of students by their supposedly enlightened Zen masters, Zen followers and academics have refused to associate the phrase \u201Ccultish behavior\u201D to these developments. This was not the case with a range of Christian oriented groups or with Asian teachers associated with other traditions or a variety of other groups, though the Zen scandals mirrored these groups. This paper will show how Zen\u2019s legitimating story and mythic history lays the ground work for authoritarian inclined charismatic leaders - titled Zen master or rosh i- to draw his followers into a world dependent on obedience, his approval and with an ethical frame dependent on the master\u2019s self serving understanding. Though Zen presents its idealized master as being fully in the world, spontaneous, unattached, a state in which one is internally firm and free while remaining perceptually competent in the world, this has hardly been the case. This is not an abstract conjecture as the paper will mention a number of examples of Zen masters, both Eastern and Western and their followers that displayed cultish behavior, while highlighting one case in particular. It is by explaining the mythic and idealized legitimating story of Zen that helps followers make sense of their lives and earlier choices when these groups implode. After all, the Zen mythology of the super human Zen master was developed over hundreds of years which makes it hard to counter for individuals breaking with a group when the Zen master\u2019s great attainment is shown to be wishful thinking.",

      "description": "Brainwashing - Scientific Concept or Mere Label (Dr. Benjamin Zablocki; Daniel Shaw)\n\nBrainwashing is not an easy concept to pin down. For decades it has been the most controversial of all words in the vocabulary of those who try to understand cults. Many scholars even doubt whether something called \u201Cbrainwashing\u201D should be spoken of at all, regarding it as nothing more than an insulting label used to scare people about the activities of socially unpopular groups. On the contrary, I\u2019m going to argue here tonight that \u201Cbrainwashing\u201D is not only a valid scientific concept but an essential one if we are to have any hope of understanding cults and helping people recover from cults. For a complete understanding of brainwashing we should try to understand three things: (1) what precisely brainwashing is; (2) how it works; and (3) how victims of brainwashing may be cured. Because the concept has been so misunderstood, I\u2019m going to focus here mainly on defining what brainwashing is (and equally important what it is not). If there is time, I will also discuss what we know about how it works and how its harmful effects can be undone.

      "description": "On Being Born and Raised in a High-Demand Group (Jill Mytton)\n\nPurpose: The purpose of this paper is to stimulate awareness and discussion of the impact on child development of being raised in a high-demand group. Background: Influences from parents, teachers and other sources that promote and facilitate normal childhood development are important aspects of the early years of an individual\u2019s life. Despite an increase in research in the cultic studies field there is still relatively little literature regarding the impact on a child\u2019s development of being born and raised in a cultic group. Using a specific example of such a group, namely the Exclusive Brethren, this paper will explore the experiences of and impact on children being raised in high-demand groups Key points: The paper is based on an informal thematic analysis of descriptions and stories provided by former members via email and social media. Like many similar groups, the brethren exert considerable control over their members based on their doctrine of \u201Cseparation from evil,\u201D a doctrine many consider to be taken to extremes. Now that their children only attend Brethren schools, all influence from sources outside the group that could offer alternative perspectives or narratives are absent. A number of important themes have emerged including the experience of fear and guilt, the impact of such a closed separate life on social development, the lack of life skills that inhibits them if they leave, and the common experience of dissonance as the child seeks to resolve the messages from different environments and narratives. The paper will also present findings from a quantitative study that suggests that control imposed in childhood might resonate in adult life through long term psychological sequelae Conclusions: I will argue that control imposed in childhood may affect various aspects of child development and may later impact on adult mental health.",

      "description": "First Generation Parents and Second Generation Children (Lorna Goldberg)\n\nOne of the most painful aspects of the cult experience is the undermining of the natural bond between parents who are in cults and their children. This presentation will explore the numerous techniques that cult leaders use to diminish the empathic connection between 37 parents and their children. The presenter also will discuss the powerful feelings that emerge when exiting a cult. How can those who leave the cult better deal with potentially crushing emotions? Often there is intense guilt on the part of the parents. On the other hand, there is often intense anger on the part of the second-generation adults. These emotions can be so overwhelming that former cult members can become unable to move towards a more satisfactory life. This presentation will contend that these post-cult feelings not only are the result of facing the reality of the cult experience; but, also, are a legacy of identification with the cult leader\u2019s punitive and uncompassionate attitude, which results in a harsh conscience for cult members. The presenter will provide examples from her clinical work, from the support group that she facilitates with Bill Goldberg, from workshops with first generation parents, and from ICSA workshops with second-generation former cult members. All case material will be disguised.",

As an adult, she took her own little children to the same park.

Each of these studies offers well-documented evidence of antisocial acts and behaviors by cult leaders toward cult members. These published accounts, as well as previously unpublished author research, are used to develop an explanatory model of the personality organization of the cult leader. Additionally, the emergence of dependent personality disorder and other psychological sequelae among cult members is investigated. Diagnostic criteria and descriptions describing antisocial personality disorder as published in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th Edition (1994) can be employed as part of the characterization of the personality organization of the cult leader. The author has participated as a clinical team member in the diagnosis of personality disorders for juvenile offenders in the California Juvenile Probation Department and for juvenile and adult offenders in the Colorado Department of Corrections. A number of peer-reviewed studies including studies by Martin, Langone, Dole, and Wiltrout, (1992); Tobias \u0026 Lalich, (1994); West \u0026 Martin, (1999); and Kent (2004), present findings from clinical interviews of ex-cult members, which report many different antisocial acts and behaviors by cult leaders. These accounts detail numerous instances of personal mistreatment, psychological intimidation, and physical and sexual abuse of cult members by cult leaders, and offer credible evidence for the hypothesis that cult leaders may meet minimum DSM-IV criteria for diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD).",

      "description": "Listening to the still small voice: Reclaiming the self after leaving religious totalistic groups (Catherine De Boer) \n\nMemberships in social groups are central to one\u2019s self- understandings and can provide individuals with purpose, meaning, and feelings of competence and value. At times, these memberships also can test and potentially compromise one\u2019s self-understandings. In either case, disengagement from a social group has identity implications, and \u201Cfinding,\u201D \u201C(re)claiming\u201D or \u0027discovering\u201D one\u2019s self is a crucial component of a successful leaving. Using disengagement from religious totalistic groups as its focus, an argument will be made that some individuals leaving such groups not only face identity challenges typical of other socialgroup leavings, but in addition may also need to cope with the impacts of mind control, trauma, abuse, and the ego destruction they experienced in the group. These unique challenges can make achievement of identity congruence postmembership especially difficult. This presentation will highlight findings from two research studies that investigated the identity implications of disengagement from a variety of social groups. The first study (2007) investigated voluntary disengagement; a current study is investigating forced leavings. These qualitative studies using a narrative analysis had as their central aims (a) to discover whether a disengagement process exists, and if so, to discover the defining characteristics and phenomenological aspects; (b) to describe the shifts in identity that accompany the process; and (c) to consider clinical or treatment implications. This presentation will make the following claims: (a) that social group disengagement is a definable social process, and what we know about this broader phenomenon bears relevance to exiting religious totalistic groups; (b) the degree to which the associated identity-based challenges are acknowledged and addressed could determine the trajectory of the individual\u2019s life, postgroup membership; and (c) a good 33 outcome includes the achievement of identity congruence and personal agency. Specific treatment strategies and practice implications will be discussed.",

These fundamental assumptions derive in large part from experience, rather than rational deliberation. In some conversions powerful inner experiences, whether manipulated (\u0022outer generated\u0022) or not (\u0022inner generated\u0022), may cause a person to adopt new fundamental assumptions. Sometimes, a new set of experiences can cause a convert to reject the new assumptions and leave the group. The resulting disillusionment may cause serious adjustment problems. The impact and implications of inner experiences should be considered when trying to help former group members.",

      "description": "A Practical Approach for Law Enforcement when Dealing with Cultic Groups (Mark Roggeman)\n\nMany people who have had an experience with cults because a relative became involved have been disillusioned when they have asked law enforcement for help.  The response they usually get is that there is not much that can be done unless there is illegal activity.  The police concern is that they may be interfering with the freedom of religion.  In the present day, police departments are successfully using problem-solving models through the Community Policing model.  This model can also be implemented when a questionable group comes to the attention of local police departments.  A simple approach that officers can take is to visit a group and let them know who they are and that they are there to assist them.  They can let the group know that the department is there to protect them from those who might dislike the group or who possibly threaten to cause harm.  The connection that results could possibly cause authorities to become aware of the group\u2019s behavior, so that the authorities may be able to observe any changes that might occur relative to the group that could signal a violation of the law or even harm to the members. Law enforcement, both local and federal, most often become involved with cults after a tragedy occurs, such as suicide, involvement in financial fraud, or a case that affects children through neglect or abuse, including sexual violations.  Most of these groups probably will never do anything that attracts the attention of law enforcement.  The problem is that illegal activities that are not known to anyone outside the group do go on because of the group\u2019s isolation from the rest of society.  This kind of situation is one in which officers become effective in gathering intelligence by getting to know the group.  The result is that officers may become aware of illegal activities.  I personally had members of a group in southern Colorado reach out to me because they did not know anyone one else outside the group.  Through this connection, authorities learned that children had died, they believe because medicine was denied as a result of the group\u2019s belief that to take medicine reflected a lack of faith. An article on cultic groups in the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin of September 2000 stated accurately that the potential for violence on behalf of members of biblically driven cults is determined almost exclusively by the whims of the cult leader.  Therefore, effective intelligence and analysis of such cults requires an extensive understanding of the cult leader. To address the concern of authorities about violating the protection of individuals\u2019 freedom of religion, officers need to be concerned only with behavior that may be harmful to people both inside and outside the group.  Granted, the beliefs may be the cause of the harmful behavior, but only the behavior is the cause for concern.",

      "description": "Saved by our Son (Russell H. Bradshaw)\n\nMost of the literature on childrenin high-demand groups focuses on how distraught parents and desperate families attempt to get young people out of a cultic group. This case study, set in both Sweden and the United States tells the opposite story. An adolescent, resisting the belief system of parents and the norms of the spiritual group he was raised in, revolted and struck out on his own path. He quickly found out that the leader was in fact, not the celibate and \u201Crealized\u201D guru he claimed to be, but a deceptive and manipulative narcissist. In the midst of his own alienation and suffering, he nevertheless struggled for several years trying to convince his \u201Ctrue-believer\u201D parents of the hypocritical behavior of the leader. He also had to contend with the morally corrupt rationalizations, denials, and double-standards adopted by the inner circle of first-class disciples and other followers who tried to destroy his credibility, his career, and his relationships. Finally, amidst death threats, police complaints, and an intense \u201Cinternet war\u201D that erupted when he created a web-site, which included first-person accounts of sexual abuse by several young women, he managed to convince his parents and drag them out of the group -after almost a quarter of a century of belief and devoted service to their Guru.Central to this case study is the psychodynamic theory of Erik Erikson concerning the adolescent stage of development labeled, \u201Cidentity versus role-confusion.\u201D The specific identity crisis at this stage is the necessity of choosing an identitystatus and the use of resistance behavior to develop this identity. In Erikson\u2019s theories, adolescent revolt, turmoil, and resistance are seen as positive attributes that are necessary to the positive development of personality",

      "description": "Anger, Rage, and Relationship (Sue Parker Hall)\nCult Pseudo-Personality (Gillie Jenkinson)\n\nIn this session Gillie Jenkinson and Sue Parker Hall will explore how theories of anger and rage (Parker Hall, 2008) and the concept of pseudo-personality (Jenkinson, 2008) interact to support ex-cult members and therapists to make meaning of a cult experience and to identify important recovery tasks. Sue will present her research around how anger and rage are different processes requiring different therapeutic responses. Gillie will outline her research on cult pseudo-personality and discuss the interaction of this with anger and rage.\n\nIt is argued that, in many cults, anger may be projected outside the group and personal anger may go underground; as a consequence, a cult member may lose the capacity to develop and protect his or her unique identity. And as a consequence of this, the cult member may become vulnerable to the persuasion and control of a thought-reform program. Alienated from one\u2018s organismic self, an individual introjects a compliant \u0027pseudo-personality\u0027 (Jenkinson, 2008) which overlays the pre-cult personality. When genuine emotional responses are forsaken, life experiences remain unprocessed and unintegrated, and cult members may operate from a state of cold rage, which often continues after leaving the group.\n\nThere will also be some discussion about Sue\u2018s ideas on \u2017adult rage\u2018. She notes there is a difference between trauma-related and nontrauma-related rage, and she identifies the negative impact of the former and the positive impact of the latter on the aims and practice of social activism.",

      "description": "Critical Thinking Skills for Former Cult Members (Doug Duncan, M.S., L.P.C.; Wendy Duncan, M.A., L.B.S.W.)\n\nFormer cult members often ask themselves, \u0022How could I have been duped so easily?\u0022 While it is certainly the case that cult recruiters make manipulative, emotional appeals, bypassing the prospective member\u0027s reason and informed consent, there are certain learned cognitive skills we can all develop that help to make us more resistant to such manipulation. What are those skills? How can I develop my reason and intellectual discernment to make it more difficult for someone to sell me a bill of goods? What can I teach my children so that they will be less subject to the dark allure of a seductive cult recruiter? Drawing from some of the basic texts in critical thinking, Doug and Wendy Duncan will show why the acquisition of critical thinking skills is helpful in a variety of contexts. Obviously, one is less likely to be drawn into a cult when one can quickly recognize a manipulative, emotional appeal, but these skills have a broad utility in many areas of modern life, such as analysis of slanted news reports, identifying deceptive sales techniques, seeing through unethical public figures, and even in facilitating informed participation in our civic institutions. Indeed, it is hard to think of any other skill set that has so many important applications as does critical thinking. Doug and Wendy will give a quick overview of critical thinking in history, identify some of the basic skills, and then have some participatory exercises that will allow for experiential learning by the workshop participants. Learning these skills cannot only help former members to keep from being re-victimized by another high-demand group, it can also facilitate their recovery process by increasing their sense of empowerment. Since the topic is so broad and cannot be exhaustively covered in the short time available for this workshop, Doug and Wendy will have handouts with a bibliography to suggest how the participants can further develop their critical thinking skills.",

      "description": "The Colorado Model: A Workshop for Ex-Members (Carol Giambalvo; Rosanne Henry) \n\nFor the past sixteen years, ICSA has been developing a brief, time-limited, yet comprehensive group model for cult recovery, which we call the Colorado Model because it was developed and refined in that state. This model consists of weekend workshops that are open to former members of destructive cults who have applied and been screened for their compatibility for attendance. The Colorado Model differs from other workshops in its strong emphasis on psycho-education and its use of former member facilitators who are mental health professionals. The ex-member facilitator team, equipped with the important credentials of cult recovery often instills hope for those struggling with cult trauma.\n\nThe Colorado Model is similar to the Trauma Recovery and Empowerment Model (TREM). This approach uses an educational and supportive, skill-building curriculum that allows members to understand and acknowledge the impact of abuse while focusing their energies on developing techniques for mastery and enhancing     their existing strengths for coping with their current life events (Harris \u0026 Fallot, 2002). The Colorado Model adapts this approach to unique workshops that address the needs of former cult members.",

In order to manipulate followers, the cult leader is revered and group members believe that God has specifically chosen him and given him absolute authority.  The cult leader\u2019s claim that God has imparted a unique and special revelation justifies his existence as the leader and his right to exercise control.  Members of pseudo-Christian cults are taught to accept the cult leader\u2019s authority as divinely mandated.  Any doubt or questions are quickly extinguished by the leader or the group culture that dismisses external influences that contradict the groups stated mission or vision.  Through spiritual manipulation, the leader is able to obtain control over the devotees.  The tactics of manipulation include the use of guilt, peer pressure, intimidation, ridicule, and fear.  Over time, the cult member is deluged with fears of thinking independently, making wrong decisions, losing salvation, losing his relationship with God, experiencing extreme calamity if he leaves the group, and numerous other horrors.\nA panel discussion of former members of pseudo-Christian cults will focus on the spiritually manipulative techniques employed by their former cults.  The panel will focus on four primary areas:\n\nManipulative techniques used by leader(s)\nThe role of fear in pseudo-Christian cults\nObstacles in transitioning out of a spiritually manipulative group/religion\nReconnecting with faith after cult affiliation",
