Domestic abuse is now recognized as a widespread social problem   It is estimated that nearly half of all women and men will experience interpersonal aggression in a familial context during their lifetimes. This talk will suggest a connection between the power dynamic of domestic abuse, or as it is now often called, interpersonal violence, and the dynamic of coercive control in cultic groups.  I will present an overview of the stages and defining characteristics of coercive relationships, common to both domestic violence and cults. The talk will focus on Albert Biderman\u0027s eight coercive methods for eliciting compliance, including threats, degradation, trauma bonding, and isolation and how they manifest in both cults and domestic violence. Education to recognize and understand relationships of dominance and subjugation is the first line of defense against interpersonal violence of all types.",

      "description": "Generation Cult: Using New Media to Share Your Story (Dhyana Levey)\n\nPresentation at the International Cultic Studies Association annual conference in Manchester, UK in 2019. The public loves a good story and is especially interested in true tales about cults. Unfortunately, there\u2019s a lot of inaccurate information floating around about these high-demand, authoritarian groups. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for people who have had personal experiences with a variety of cults to share their stories. So, how does someone do that? Traditionally, writers have published books. Some are lucky enough to get a legitimate publisher, but that can be difficult, even more so now as that publishing industry has been in decline. But there are many other options now for people to share their stories. The internet and social media have become a very effective way to share information about cults, from online support groups to personal blogs to a simple confession on Facebook shared with your friends. Podcasts are an excellent way to learn about cults. There\u2019s one just called \u201CCults,\u201D another called \u201CWe\u2019re Starting a Cult,\u201D podcasts that just focus on a single cult like \u201CHeaven\u2019s Gate\u201D and then there\u2019s my own called \u201CGeneration Cult,\u201D that discusses people raised in high-demand groups. At first I thought traditional publishing was the only way to get my message to the public, but I learned how to make my own podcast and it wasn\u2019t that hard. Other people can do it, too. There are plenty of creative options out there now for former cult members to use to share their stories, they just have to know how to use them.",

      "description": "Developing the \u2018Totalistic Identity Theory\u2019 for cults and extremist groups\n(Rod Dubrow-Marshall, Ph.D.)\n\nResearch previously presented (Dubrow-Marshall and Martin 2008) has articulated the \u2018Totalistic Identity Theory\u2019 for cultic and extremist groups whereby it is advanced that members identity structures are largely dominated and fixed on the cult identity at the expense of many or all other levels and categories of identity and in a polarized or differentiated position in relation to other groups and society at large. This theory (Dubrow-Marshall 2007) is an extension of traditional social psychological theory on group identity (e.g. Turner\u2019s (1987) Self-Categorization Theory). Analysis of former cult members from the Wellspring Retreat and Resource Center in Ohio (Dubrow-Marshall \u0026 Martin 2008) has also shown a clear relationship between aspects of psychopathology and extent of identity with the group, thus providing evidence that a totalistic or polarized identity structure is harmful for group members.\nThis paper presents further analysis from the Wellspring sample advancing further a model for the specific psychopathology of former cult members. This analysis points to additional evidence for the \u2018Totalistic Identity Theory\u2019 and in particular aspects relating to the polarized identity position and its relationship to overall psychological well being and the perception by current group members of non-group members and the rest of the world and the behavioural correlates of such perceptions. The theory also points to and supports strategies for depolarization and de-identification with extremist groups and approaches to preventing initial recruitment to them.",

      "description": "Religious Conflict Resolution (Michael Langone, PhD.) \n\nResearch suggests that, in the West, hundreds of thousands of individuals join and leave\ncultic groups each year. Research studies also suggest that at least a sizable minority of\nthose who join cultic groups are adversely affected. The families of these group members,\nand probably many other families, tend to become concerned about their loved one\u2018s group\ninvolvement.\nRoughly 80 percent of the groups that cause concern are religious. The psychological,\npolitical, and occasionally commercial groups that aren\u2018t overtly religious often influence\nmembers\u2018 lives as though they were religions because they typically bring about a major\nshift in members\u2018 views of self, world, and other\u2014i.e., a conversion experience.\nDuring the past 25 years, most professionals who work with these families have emphasized\nhelping them persuade their loved ones to leave cultic groups. Exit counseling, a process\naimed at helping families create conditions under which their loved one will reevaluate a\ngroup involvement, has been very valuable to thousands of grateful families and group\nmembers. (Exit counseling is also often referred to as \u2015thought reform consultation.\u2016)\n\nNevertheless, only a very small percentage of families are able to proceed to an exit-\ncounseling intervention. In many cases, an intervention is not possible or even appropriate\n\nbecause the loved one\u2018s relationship to a group does not fit the typical pattern of\nexploitative manipulation associated with the subjects of exit-counseling interventions, even\nthough the family may have valid concerns. In other cases, the loved one may be so\nattached to the group (e.g., because of family ties within the group, decades of\ncommitment, fear of adjusting to the mainstream world) that his or her departure is\nunlikely, even with an intervention.\nVery little attention has been paid to this large majority of families for whom an exit\ncounseling is not feasible or appropriate. Livia Bardin\u2018s book, Coping with Cult Involvement:\nA Handbook for Families and Friends, offers some guidance. Ms. Bardin says that a cult\ninvolvement is often \u2015a situation to manage, not a problem to solve.\u2016\nThis talk will explore ways in which families can more effectively \u2015manage\u2016 a loved one\u2018s\ninvolvement in a group that causes concern, at least in part because of the nature of the\nconversion that it tends to bring about. The talk will approach the situation as a family\nconflict over what at least overtly are religious issues. Through lecture and discussion, the\nspeakers, a counseling psychologist, an educational/organizational consultant, and an exit\ncounselor (thought-reform consultant), will examine\n- How families and group members can come to better understand and appreciate\neach other\u2018s perspectives on the conflict that divides them.\n- How they can improve communication so as to reduce the level of conflict.\n- How they can negotiate mutual behavioral changes that will reduce the level of\nconflict.\n- How they can come to terms with the need to compromise so as to protect the love\nbetween them while respecting differences that divide them.",

      "description": "Reawakening Your Spirituality After a Cult Experience\n(Doug and Wendy Duncan)\n\nPresentation at the International Cultic Studies Association annual conference in Philadelphia, PA in 2018. Spiritual abuse is widespread and can be found in all religions. Cultic/spiritual abuse occurs when leaders use their position of authority to manipulate, control, and dominate. The cult leader portrays himself as the truth-bearer and members are led to believe that God has specifically chosen him to bring light into the world. The cult leader\u2019s claim that God has given him a unique and special revelation justifies his role as the leader and his right to exercise control over his members. Followers are taught to accept the leader\u2019s authority as divinely mandated. In whatever manner the abusive leader uses God, karma, salvation, the threat of damnation, the promise of enlightenment, or other spiritual promises/threats, the result is the same: spiritual abuse. Any doubts or questions are quickly extinguished by the leader utilizing intimidation, humiliation, and fear. Over time, the devotee adopts the cult\u2019s view of God and has difficulty leaving because of the fear that doing so means they are leaving \u201CThe Truth\u201D and even God himself. When an individual manages to separate from a cultic or spiritually abusive group, he faces myriad issues of a physical and psychological nature. Defining and reclaiming post-cult spirituality is often postponed while the individual sorts through day-to-day life outside the cult. However, acknowledging the damage and recapturing one\u2019s spiritual identity is a core task of recovery. How can we reawaken our spirituality? How do we fill that emptiness of the soul? How do we get past the feelings of confusion and disillusionment? How do we recapture a sense of purpose? This presentation will focus on:\n \nObstacles in transitioning out of a spiritually manipulative group/religion \nExpunging the image of the god of the cult \nRecovering your faith \nReconnecting with your spiritual self\u201D",

Unlike closed cult groups, ICSA firmly is committed to freedom of thought and expression. ICSA conferences provide an open arena for people from different backgrounds with diverse points of view. The speaker believes, in general, that dealing with conflicting viewpoints can be a healthy phenomenon. Dialogue expands our reality by helping us gain new insight into others as well as ourselves. In this presentation, the speaker will consider some factors that undermine ICSA\u2019s goal for dialogue among diverse groups and will suggest some ideas that might help members to connect. To understand the undermining factors, the speaker will focus upon the concept of transference and, also, upon the human tendency to stereotype those from groups that are different from their own. The speaker suggests that we should not let our expectation of others shape our reality. It is only possible to hear and learn from one another if there is a willingness to move past our assumptions.

This panel will attempt to cast a more realistic light on some of the less positive elements within the religion of Buddhism, which as a whole still tends to enjoy an unblemished, \u0022warm and fuzzy\u0022 standing in the public imagination. \n\n1. Ready to Mine: Zen\u2019s Legitimating Mythology and Cultish Behavior. Long-time practitioner and outspoken critic of Zen Buddhism Stuart Lachs will show how Zen\u0027s legitimating story and mythic history lays the groundwork for authoritarian-inclined charismatic leaders \u2012 called \u0022Zen masters\u0022 or roshi \u2012 to draw their followers into a world based on unquestioning obedience to the master, reliance on his approval, and an ethical framework dependent on his self-serving understanding. Though Zen presents its idealized masters as being fully in the world, spontaneous, and \u2012 most importantly \u2012 \u0022unattached\u0022, a state in which they are internally firm and free while remaining perceptually competent, this has hardly been the case in reality. Stuart will accordingly provide a number of examples of Asian and Western Zen masters who, along with their followers, have displayed cult-like behavior. Link to blog: https://buddhism-controversy-blog.com/2017/07/16/ready-to-mine-zens-legitimating-mythology-and-cultish-behavior/  \n\n2. Tibetan Buddhist monk Tenzin Peljor will explain how doctrinal issues and cross-cultural misunderstandings, for example about the concepts of faith and the guru in Tibetan Buddhism, can contribute to abusive spiritual systems. His review will begin with the highly controversial \u0022New Kadampa Tradition\u0022 and his own experiences with that movement, and then expand to other groups. Having run an online information portal about controversial Buddhist groups for many years, Tenzin can draw on numerous examples of suspect behavior from across the broad Buddhist spectrum. Link to PowerPoint: https://tenzinpeljor.de/PDF/ICSA2017.pdf \n\n3. How Zen Groups Respond to Allegations of Abuse. Zen teacher Christopher Hamacher will compare various Zen Buddhist groups from the perspective of how they have responded to abuse by their teachers. Based on a number of recent scandals, he will demonstrate how various Buddhist doctrines are invoked by the leaders and students, firstly to deny the abuse and/or refuse to intervene, and afterwards to deal \u0022compassionately\u0022 \u2012 i.e ineffectively \u2012 with the abuser. Christopher will then propose that, ultimately, the way a group reacts to allegations of misconduct may be a better indicator of its underlying dysfunction than the content of the allegations themselves.",

      "description": "Spiritual Issues in Counseling (Rev. Robert Pardon; Judy Pardon)\n2017\n\nSome apply the term spiritual abuse to any kind of psychological, physical, or sexual abuse that takes place in a religious context.  Others apply the term specifically to manipulations that damage a person\u0027s relationship to God or to his/her core self. Spiritual abuse has been reported in mainstream religious organizations as well as nonmainstream groups, such as cults.\n\nThe terms psychological abuse or emotional abuse refer to harms that overlap those associated with both of these conceptualizations of spiritual abuse. These harms include but are not limited to damaged self-esteem, induced dependency, impaired capacity to trust oneself or others, and emotional reactions such as anger, anxiety, and depression. In some cases, one\u0027s faith in God may also be shaken.\n\nTo a large degree, the choice of a term, psychological abuse or spiritual abuse, depends upon the framework (psychological or religious) with which the speaker/writer feels comfortable. This two-day conference finds value in resources coming from psychological and religious frameworks, though obviously some issues, e.g., questions about God\u0027s mercy, may require religious concepts to address properly. The conference is aimed at those who were spiritually abused, whether recently or in the past, family members concerned about a loved one, and helping professionals, including pastors and therapists.\n\nThe agenda will include the following topics:\n\nThe varieties of abuse\nCoping with triggers\nPersonal accounts of spiritual abuse\nPsychological issues in counseling\nSpiritual issues in counseling\nHow can churches and synagogues become spiritual safe havens\nSpiritual abuse victims dialogue with religious and mental health professionals\nOpen discussion",

      "description": "Overcoming Barriers to Healthy Sexuality for S/MGAs (Doni Whitsett)\n\nPart 1 of this series discussed some general sexual issues of S/MGAs. Part 2 addresses more specific issues with which this populations often struggles. \n\nThe life of a cult child is highly controlled and their personality shaped to conform to the expectations of the leadership. These expectations carry severe consequences when not adhered to. While some groups suppress erotic development, others foster indiscriminate sexual activity creating an atmosphere that is inappropriately sexually charged and overstimulating. Anxiety surrounding sexuality may result in the sexual self becoming alienated. Messages instilled by the cult leader or belief system may continue in a person\u2019s psyche and body after a former member throws off the constricting cult norms and seeks to explore their own sexual potential. Learning to cope with these messages is necessary to be able to engage in healthy relationships. \n\nInsecure attachments characteristic of families in cults well as messages instilled by the cult often contribute to biological sexual dysfunction.  This talk will address some specific sexual difficulties in the various phases of sexual response (i.e. desire, arousal and orgasmic phases) and offer suggestions for overcoming them.",

Each month will feature a different clinician discussing some aspect of clinical work. Each presentation will serve as a stimulus for questions and a discussion of clinical issues, which will occur during the following hour.\n\nDr Gillie Jenkinson will discuss the rationale for being informed by the Phases of Recovery and Growth when working with former cult members. She will explore how a psychoeducational approach can assist the individual to unlayer and dismantle their cult pseudo-identity. The therapist can then work with the former member\u2019s authentic autonomous identity and not the cult pseudo-identity. The client can then recover and grow, free of the influence and control of the cultic experience.\n\nGillie Jenkinson, PhD, is an accredited counsellor and psychotherapist in UK and is experienced in delivering counselling face-to-face as well as on the telephone and Skype. She served two internships at Wellspring Retreat Center, Ohio, and has many years\u2019 experience working with trauma, including survivors of spiritual and cult abuse, and sexual abuse. She has developed an approach to counselling former members - \u0022Time Away for Post-Cult Counselling.\u0022 Gillie was a member of an abusive Bible-based cult in the 1970\u2019s. She is a regular presenter at conferences and a published author, including a co-authoring a chapter entitled \u0022Pathological Spirituality\u0022 for a medical text book entitled Spirituality and Psychiatry, published by RCPsych Publications in UK - 2009.

Individuals raised in cults may have never received appropriate medical care and may have many misconceptions about illness, doctors and medicine. This talk will explore how two second generation adult (SGA) former cult members overcame those barriers. You will hear from one SGA who become his own medical advocate and was able to form healing, therapeutic relationships with his medical team and doctors. The other speaker is an SGA who went to medical school after exiting the cult and has been a practicing family physician for 20 years. She will explore the issue from both perspectives and will specifically address stigmas attached to mental illness and psychiatric medicines.\n\nEva Mackey Meyrat, MD, is a second-generation adult former cult member and a facilitator of the ICSA CT Workshop for Those Born or Raised in Cultic Groups. Her mother became a devotee of an Indian guru in 1975 when she was one year old. He taught a branch of Hinduism called Advaita Vedanta, a non-dualistic philosophy which teaches that the self is one with the ultimate truth or reality. Half of Eva\u2019s childhood was spent in the ashram in India, where she and the other children were unsupervised much of the time. Despite the upheavals and instability that characterized her childhood, Eva managed to get out of the cult at the age of 16 and eventually earned her MD degree from the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. Dr. Mackey has a busy family practice, and she lives near Dallas with her husband and four children.\n\nCk Rardin, facilitator, ICSA CT Workshop for Those Born or Raised in Cultic Groups, was born in California. His parents raised him in a cultic Catholic group and when he reached adolescence, they signed over their parental rights to the group. Ck was then sent to the cult\u2019s headquarters in Itaquera, Sao Paulo, Brazil. He stayed in the group till age 26 when he gathered the courage and strength to leave the organization on his own. After leaving he became a certified EMT, then was certified and joined the American Society of Clinical Pathologists (ASCP ), with which he maintains his certification. He now runs his own IT consulting firm in upstate New York and spends much of his time involved in recovery from his experience, working to expose these groups (for example, assisting in research for MTV\u2019s production of The Cult Question) as well as helping others in their recovery.",

After they leave the cult, they may bring these beliefs and character traits with them. S/MGAs can discover that attitudes shaped within the cult might be impeding their present life. For example, in the cult, they were expected to reach perfection. This belief causes them to struggle with internalized pressure to be perfect after they leave. When S/MGAs fail at perfection, they typically might feel depressed or filled with shame. S/MGAs also might experience symptoms of C-PTSD, such as hypervigilant or hypovigilent (dissociative) behavior. Additionally, S/MGAs typically struggle with complicated emotions about their parents in the cult, and they might be uncertain about how to deal with their feelings after they leave the cult. Finally, the presenters will explore how post-cult relationships and therapy might aid former cult members.\n\nLorna Goldberg, LCSW, PsyA, Board Member and Past President of ICSA, is a clinical social worker and psychoanalyst in private practice and Director at the Institute of Psychoanalytic Studies.

Lesbian and gay individuals who grow up in religious cults can face opposition and condemnation based on the individual\u2019s affectional/sexual orientation. This opposition may come from religious doctrines and teachings, cult/church leaders, and even from family members. As a result of this opposition and condemnation, LGB individuals may struggle with depression, anxiety, drug/alcohol abuse, self-mutilation, and suicidal ideation.

This is not a \u201Cfun\u201D book. Nor is it a book that aims to validate feelings of anger, hurt, helplessness, and fear, although it does that to some extent. This book is a handbook, a tool designed to help you achieve a goal, namely, to help a loved one. As with all tools, the book requires effort to learn how to use it. It is not something that you merely read. It is something that you use, something that you wrestle with, that you come back to again and again.\n\nIf you are willing to give the requisite time and mental exertion that this book demands, I am confident that you will find it to be extremely helpful. It may not solveyour problem, for, as Mrs. Bardin states in the Introduction, a cult involvement is often a situation to manage, not a problem to solve. The book will, however, make you confident that you are doing all that you realistically can to manage, if not solve, the problem that has caused you so much distress.\n\nAbout the Author:\nLivia Bardin, MSW, is a clinical social worker who has been engaged with cult victims and their families for more than fifteen years. She is particularly interested in the interface between high-demand groups and cults and mainstream society. Her research in this area has been published in the Cultic Studies Review and the Journal of Public Child Welfare. Now retired, Ms. Bardin has provided training on cult-related issues for mental health professionals in the Washington area and elsewhere, She is the author of Coping with Cult Involvement: A Handbook for Families and Friends of cult members. In 2014 Ms. Bardin received ICSA\u0027s Margaret T. Singer Award.",

Each month will feature a different clinician discussing some aspect of clinical work. Each presentation will serve as a stimulus for questions and a discussion of clinical issues, which will occur during the following hour.\n\nDaniel Shaw LCSW will discuss his clinical approach to working with cult survivors. His approach is based on more than 25 years of experience as a psychoanalyst, and on his own experience of 13 years living and working in the ashram of a guru he came to see as a cult leader. He will discuss the importance of psycho-education, about the psychology of the cult leader, and about the effects on survivors of trauma. His approach emphasizes the importance of self-compassion, the antidote to self-alienation, through the use of self-reflection and self-regulation skills.\n\nAfter completing this webinar, participants will be able to:\n1. Define self-alienation and identify the symptoms of self-alienation in cult survivors. \n2. Identify the psychopathology of the traumatizing narcissist, including their specific abusive behaviors that negatively impact the functioning of cult survivors.\n3. Educate cult-survivor clients to develop self-reflection and affect regulation skills in their process of trauma recovery. \n\nBibliography:\nBenjamin, J. (1998).

This talk will focus on how unhealthy Christian churches may cultivate an environment for spiritual abuse to thrive, the role controlling theology can play in creating a high-pressure environment, and conclude with questions you can raise about a group to help evaluate spiritual abuse, the potential for it, or if high-control scenarios already exist. Understanding my experience was essential for my recovery to begin! The context for this discussion will pull from reflections of being a born and raised former member of a fundamentalist Christian sect.\n\nOverview of series:\nThis series is specifically for second and multi-generational adult former cult members, however, this is going to be the first program for S/MGAs that is open to all. In the past, ICSA workshops for this population have been limited to those who were themselves born or raised in cults. But we see the increasing need for those outside of this population to learn about the unique recovery issues relevant to S/MGAs.\n\nPresenter Bio:\nAshlen Hilliard is the Director of Events for the International Cultic Studies Association (ICSA).

Children will dissociate from their emotional reactions to abuse or neglect in an attempt to protect themselves and survive in the face of overwhelming anxiety. Dissociation allows them to continue to rely on a frightening or abandoning adult. Children defend themselves further by identifying with their perpetrator\u0027s attitude. The cult leader or parent reinforces this attitude by creating a punitive and shaming world for the child. Living in such a harsh reality has numerous ramifications for the character of SGA/MGAs. SGA/MGAs continue to struggle with their harsh conscience after they leave the cult. To help, therapists can provide a compassionate and respectful environment where former cult members gain a broader sense of reality by connecting the present to the past. \n\nOverview of series:\nThis series is specifically for second and multi-generational adult former cult members, however, this is going to be the first program for S/MGAs that is open to all.

The cult involved parent is likely to display unhealthy attachment patterns which will negatively impact the child. Erickson\u2019s eight developmental stages will be reviewed with an emphasis on how they may not be successfully complete by children in cults. Children develop survival strategies in response the unhealthy caregiver and environment. These strategies, while necessary for the child, may create problems as the child grows into an adult. These problems include but are not limited to the following: Problems with the development of a unique identity and sense of self. 2. Trouble with affect regulation and inability to self-soothe. Those who were raised in cults often struggle with anxiety and depression. 3. Trouble with setting and maintaining healthy boundaries. 4.

Half of Eva\u2019s childhood was spent in the ashram in India, where she and the other children were unsupervised much of the time. Despite the upheavals and instability that characterized her childhood, Eva managed to get out of the cult at the age of 16 and eventually earned her MD degree from the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.

Regardless of the primary focus of a particular cult (e.g. religious, political, therapeutic, philosophical, etc.) practically everyone who has been in one experienced feelings and reactions that were common to most cult encounters. These reactions and experiences were the predictable results of the group dynamics and manipulations common to all cults, even though their cult may have offered a self-serving mystical or magical explanation for them. For the initial presentation in this recovery workshop, the presenter will describe some common experiences of second-and multi-generation cult members (SGA\u0027s/MGA\u0027s). The goal of this presentation is to help the participants to define and describe these experiences as well as to consider non-mystical explanations for them.\n\nOverview of series:\nThis series is specifically for second and multi-generational adult former cult members, however, this is going to be the first program for S/MGAs that is open to all.

Carli McConkey was 21 years old when she happened upon New Age guru, Natasha Lakaev, and her personal development company, Life Integration Programmes, at the Mind Body Spirit Festival in Sydney, Australia in 1996. What at first appeared professional and promising, became a vehicle for psychological and physical abuse. Over the next thirteen years, Carli lost her freedom\u2026her mind\u2026and her family. This memoir demonstrates the subtle and insidious process of mind control, gives insights into the period of recovery after escape, and shows how determination and strength can overcome adversity.\u0022 You can purchase her book here: https://www.amazon.com/Cult-Effect-Story-Control-Australia-ebook/dp/B074DFJ3BH#:~:text=The%20Cult%20Effect%20is%20an,absolutely%20never%20signed%20up%20for.\n \nAbout the Author\n\u0022Carli McConkey spent over 13 years in a destructive cult from the age of 21 to 35 and escaped in January, 2010. She says \u0027escape\u0027, because she was brainwashed into believing that she could not leave. If she did, either her three children would be taken from her, or she and her family would die in Armageddon, prophesised by the cult leader for December 2012. Carli is a normal, everyday person, who is intelligent and from a loving family, and yet she found herself in this situation. Carli wishes to help educate family and friends of current and former cult members so that they are better able to understand the process of mind control and support their loved ones through recovery. She also hopes that sharing her story, personal insights and triumphs, will help support fellow ex-cult members and prevent others from falling prey to such predators. Carli completed a BA (Communication), majoring in Organisational Communication and Public Relations, at Charles Sturt University, Bathurst, in 1995. She has been rebuilding her career since leaving the cult, working as an Executive Assistant. Carli lives in Sydney with her three children.\u0022",

Muster joined the International Society of Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON)--the Hare Krishnas--in 1978, shortly after the death of the movement\u0027s spiritual master, and worked for ten years as a public relations secretary and editor of the organization\u0027s newspaper, the ISKCON World Review. In this candid and critical account, Muster follows the inner workings of the movement and the Hare Krishnas\u0027 progressive decline.\nCombining personal reminiscences, published articles, and internal documents, Betrayal of the Spirit details the scandals that beset the Krishnas--drug dealing, weapons stockpiling, deceptive fundraising, child abuse, and murder within ISKCON\u2013as well as the dynamics of schisms that forced some 95 percent of the group\u0027s original members to leave. In the midst of this institutional disarray, Muster continued her personal search for truth and religious meaning as an ISKCON member until, disillusioned at last with the movement\u0027s internal divisions, she quit her job and left the organization.\n\nIn a new preface to the paperback edition, Muster discusses the personal circumstances that led her to ISKCON and kept her there as the movement\u0027s image worsened. She also talks about \u0022the darkest secret\u0022\u2013child abuse in the ISKCON parochial schools--that was covered up by the public relations office where she worked. \nhttps://www.amazon.com/Betrayal-Spirit-Headlines-Krishna-Movement/dp/0252065662\n\nAbout Nori:\nNori Muster is a journalist, researcher, and artist based in Arizona. She earned her Master of Science degree at Western Oregon University studying creative art therapy. She started writing full time for publication in 1981, and published Betrayal of the Spirit, a memoir, in 1997.\nNori has written two follow-up books, Child of the Cult and Cult Survivor\u0027s Handbook. She writes journal articles on the subject, is a spokesperson to the media, and a regular presenter at International Cultic Studies Association (ICSA) conferences.\n\nNori wrote her own I Ching (Learning to Flow with the Dao), and her own positive thinking book (Dreaming Peace), for people in the post-9/11 world.

      "description": "Terror, Love, \u0026 Brainwashing: Attachment in Cults and Totalitarian Systems\u0022\nInterview with Alexandra Stein by Joseph Szimhart\n \n\u0022Written by a cult survivor and renowned expert on cults and totalitarianism, Terror, Love and Brainwashing draws on the author\u2019s 25 years of study and research to explain how almost anyone, given the right set of circumstances, can be radically manipulated to engage in otherwise incomprehensible and often dangerous acts.\n \nIllustrated with compelling stories from a range of cults and totalitarian systems, from religious to political to commercial, the book defines and analyses the common and identifiable traits that underlie almost all these groups. It focuses on how charismatic, authoritarian leaders control their followers\u2019 attachment relationships via manipulative social structures and ideologies so that, emotionally and cognitively isolated, they become unable to act in their own survival interests. Using the evolutionary theory of attachment to demonstrate the psychological impact of these environments, and incorporating the latest neuroscientific findings, Stein illustrates how the combined dynamic of terror and \u2018love\u2019 works to break down people\u2019s ability to think and behave rationally. From small local cults to global players like ISIS and North Korea, the impact of these movements is widespread and growing.\n \nThis important book offers clarity and a unique perspective on the dynamics of these systems of control, and concludes with guidance to foster greater awareness and prevention. It will be essential reading for mental health professionals in the field, as well as policy makers, legal professionals, cult survivors, and their families, as well as anyone with an interest in these disturbing groups. Students of social and developmental psychology will also find it fascinating.\u0022\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Terror-Love-Brainwashing-Attachment-Totalitarian/dp/1138677973",

For over a decade, gossip swirled around northern Utah that a secretive group of religious zealots were buying up homes to take over a developing neighborhood in an Ogden community. The homes were known far and wide for their immaculately landscaped yards. Rumors spread that a well-known landscaper in the city had proclaimed himself to be a prophet of god and was being commanded to start his own secret religion that promoted polygamy. It was also believed these extremists were stockpiling weapons as part of their doomsday beliefs. In reality, the leader was directing some of the most repugnant crimes against women and children ever seen in the state. The hidden atrocities of the cult may never have been discovered if not for the courage of one of its members. Thirty years later, victims reconnected with each other and with the lead investigator to address the shortcomings of the criminal justice system regarding child victims.\n\nYou can purchase \u0022Deceived\u0022 here: https://www.profilingevil.com/store/p/zionsociety",

By the time her older brother was ten, Lisa\u0027s father had him smoking pot. By the time Lisa was ten, Lisa\u0027s mother had them pledging their lives to the Unification Church (the \u0022Moonies\u0022) and self-appointed Messiah, Reverend Sun Myung Moon. As a child Lisa knew the ecstatic comfort of inclusion in a cult and as a teenager the torment of rebelling against it. As an adult, Lisa struggled to break free from the hold of abuse and the scars in her heart, mind, and psyche--battling her own addictions and inner demons and searching her soul for a sense of self-worth. Told in spirited candor, to the moon and back reveals how one can leave behind absurdity and horror and create a life of intention and joy. \n\nAbout the Author: The best seats Lisa Kohn ever had at Madison Square Garden were at her mother\u0027s wedding, and the best cocaine she ever had was from her father\u0027s friend, the judge. Lisa was raised in a religious cult (the Moonies) with her mom and in a life of \u0022sex, drugs, and squalor\u0022 in New York City\u0027s East Village in the 1970s with her dad. Lisa is now a teacher and public speaker who owns a leadership consulting and executive coaching firm and who works to bring to others the tools, mind-shifts, and practices she\u2019s found that have helped her heal from her crazy, mixed-up childhood.\nYou can read more at her website, www.lisakohnwrites.com, where you can also download the first chapter of her book, watch and read Lisa\u2019s interviews in media such as Megyn Kelly Today, Daily Mail, Marie Claire, and hear her podcast interviews for IndoctrNation, Generation Cult, and Lionrock. Lisa will always tell you that she is a native New Yorker, but she currently lives in Pennsylvania with her husband and two children, whenever they\u2019re around.

      "description": "Psycho-Social Aspects of Belief in Conspiracy Theories (Bill Goldberg, LCSW, PsyA)\n\nMore than any other time in recent history, conspiracy theories have contaminated political thinking in this country. Bizarre theories and explanations for current events, both real and imagined, have become an acceptable part of our public dialogue; and some political leaders have given credence to speculations about the motivations of opponents that would once have been viewed as embarrassingly ludicrous.  In this lecture and conversation, we will explore this phenomenon from a psychoanalytic viewpoint. We will discuss the historical antecedents of today\u0027s conspiracy theories and the factors in the Information Age that make it unique. We will also discuss developmental and defensive factors that render otherwise intelligent individuals susceptible to conspiracy theories. \n\nLearning Objectives:\n\n1. Participants will be able to identify the similarities and differences between today\u2019s conspiracy theories and their historical antecedents.\n2. Participants will be able to identify the developmental factors that render people vulnerable to the appeal of conspiracy theories.\n3. Participants will learn intervention techniques that can help clients who believe in bizarre conspiracy theories.\n\nWilliam Goldberg, LCSW, PsyA, is a clinical social worker and psychoanalyst with over forty years\u2019 experience working with former cult members. He and his wife, Lorna, co-lead a support group for former cult members, which has been meeting for over forty years. It is the oldest group of its kind in the world. In 2007, Bill retired from the Rockland County, NY Department of Mental Health, where he directed several programs and clinics. He is presently an adjunct professor in the social work and social science departments of Dominican College and he is on the faculty of the Institute for Psychoanalytic Studies. Bill has published numerous articles. Bill is a frequent speaker at ICSA conferences, and he and Lorna have been the recipients of the Authentic CAN Hall of Fame Award and the Leo J. Ryan Award.

      "description": "\u0022Traumatic Narcissism: Relational Systems of Subjugation\u0022\nInterview with Daniel Shaw by Joseph Szimhart\n\nIn this volume, Traumatic Narcissism: Relational Systems of Subjugation, Daniel Shaw presents a way of understanding the traumatic impact of narcissism as it is engendered developmentally, and as it is enacted relationally. Focusing on the dynamics of narcissism in interpersonal relations, Shaw describes the relational system of what he terms the \u0027traumatizing narcissist\u0027 as a system of subjugation \u2013 the objectification of one person in a relationship as the means of enforcing the dominance of the subjectivity of the other. Daniel Shaw illustrates the workings of this relational system of subjugation in a variety of contexts: theorizing traumatic narcissism as an intergenerationally transmitted relational/developmental trauma; and exploring the clinician\u0027s experience working with the adult children of traumatizing narcissists. He explores the relationship of cult leaders and their followers, and examines how traumatic narcissism has lingered vestigially in some aspects of the psychoanalytic profession. Bringing together theories of trauma and attachment, intersubjectivity and complementarity, and the rich clinical sensibility of the Relational Psychoanalysis tradition, Shaw demonstrates how narcissism can best be understood not merely as character, but as the result of the specific trauma of subjugation, in which one person is required to become the object for a significant other who demands hegemonic subjectivity. Traumatic Narcissism presents therapeutic clinical opportunities not only for psychoanalysts of different schools, but for all mental health professionals working with a wide variety of modalities. Although primarily intended for the professional psychoanalyst and psychotherapist, this is also a book that therapy patients and lay readers will find highly readable and illuminating.\n\nAbout the Author:\nDaniel Shaw, LCSW is a psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapist in private practice in New York City, and in Nyack, New York. He is a training analyst, teacher and supervisor of analytic candidates at the National Institute for the Psychotherapies in New York City.

      "description": "\u0022Whispering in the Daylight: The Children of Tony Alamo Christian Ministries and Their Journey to Freedom\u0022\nInterview with Debby Schriver by Joseph Szimhart\n\nBeginning in the 1960s in California, erstwhile music producer Tony Alamo became interested in authoritarian religion and, along with his charismatic wife, Susan, began gathering followers. By the 1970s, Tony Alamo Christian Ministries had established particularly strong footholds in Arkansas, as well as maintaining outposts in California. The ministry gained a legion of followers, with branches not only in the USA but in places as diverse as Africa and Sri Lanka. Even through their leader\u2019s eventual imprisonment under federal charges (related to transporting minors across state lines for sexual purposes), Alamo\u2019s vision survived\u2014and his community survives him today.\n\nWhispering in the Daylight: The Children of Tony Alamo Christian Ministries and Their Journey to Freedom is based on numerous interviews from group members and, more importantly, on interviews with the children\u2014second and third-generation followers. Author Debby Schriver chronicles how this group was formed, documenting its many abuses and its gradual adoption of cult-like behaviors and practices. Like many cult leaders, Tony Alamo had different faces. The public saw him as a somewhat self-important but harmless music promoter and designer of bedazzling denim jackets. Schriver chronicles firsthand the condemnation, rejection, and torment that the second-generation survivors of Tony Alamo\u2019s abuses experienced. Schriver\u2019s interviews, particularly those with children, illuminate the real horrors of the Alamos\u2019 behavior, ranging from economic exploitation, extreme forced fasts, and beatings, that resulted in permanent injury.\n\nSchriver\u2019s extensive research\u2014including interviews with Tony Alamo himself, harrowing visits to Alamo compounds, and witnessing gut-wrenching confrontations between freed children and their unreformed parents\u2014tells the story of a closed group whose origins and history are unlikely ever to be definitively unraveled.\n\nAbout the Author:\nDEBBY SCHRIVER has spent her career working with students, parents, and staff in the departments of student life and employee training and development at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. She is the author of In the Footsteps of Champions: The University of Tennessee Lady Volunteers, the First Three Decades, coauthor, with Jenny Moshak, of Ice \u2019n\u2019 Go: Score in Sports and Life, and coeditor, with Lucia McMahon of To Read My Heart: The Journal of Rachel Van Dyke, 1810\u20131811.\n\nYou can purchase Debby\u0027s book here: https://www.amazon.com/Whispering-Daylight-Children-Christian-Ministries/dp/1621903869",

For the first time in a public forum Phil told the story of how while looking into a case in his law office against the leader of a drug rehabilitation program led by Miller Newton, he made the cultic connection to his sister\u2019s involvement with an abusive cult leader, Fred Newman, and how making that connection led to his success in exposing the cultic nature of Kids and Straight, Inc.  Phil\u2019s fascinating and moving talk included a discussion of his advocacy work in the troubled teen industry and other cultic groups including NXIVM and focused from the perspective of a practicing lawyer what \u201Ccult law\u201D is and is not.  It concluded with a discussion of the legal issues that people concerned about cults focus on.\n\n\u0022Keeping a family member from joining a toxic group;\nGetting them out if they are in;\nOnce they are in preventing a loved one from turning over financial assets \nAttempting to speak out about a cultic group (particularly on the internet) after leaving as part of the healing process and with the goal of helping others;\nSuing the group or its leaders for economic and emotional damages arising from cult involvement;\nDealing with family court issues of custody and visitation when one parent remains and one leaves;  \nUsing proof of brainwashing to excuse criminal conduct, mitigate a criminal penalty or convince prosecutors to pursue a prosecution of a group or its leader.\u0022\n\nICSA has decided to make Phil\u2019s talk available on the internet as a stimulus presentation and to then provide an interactive discussion with Phil Elberg, Bill Goldberg, Pat Ryan, and Joseph Kelly moderated by Ashlen Hilliard in which legal and related issues associated with these topics can be discussed.\n\nPhil Elberg, Esq. \u2013 pelberglaw@gmail.com \n\nWilliam Goldberg, LCSW, PsyA \u2013 bill@blgoldberg.com \n(blgoldberg.com)\n\nPat Ryan \u2013 pryan19147@gmail.com  \nJoseph Kelly -- joekelly411@gmail.com \n(CultNews101.com)\n(Cults101.org)\n(CultMediation.com): \n(Intervention101.com)\n(CultRecovery101.com)",

      "description": "Former Member Guilt and the Path to Self-Forgiveness (Nori Muster, Lorna Goldberg)\n\nWhen individuals join a dangerous cult, they unconsciously adopt the group\u2019s negative habits. Certain assumptions in the group\u2019s \u201Cperfect\u201D dogma contribute to this process, for example, leaders might openly profess \u201Canything is allowed if it\u2019s done for god,\u201D \u201Cthe guru said it\u2019s okay, so it\u2019s okay,\u201D and \u201Cthe laws of man do not apply to us because we dedicated ourselves to god.\u201D To prove themselves loyal, new recruits quickly learn to repress their gut feelings and rightly-felt doubts. Authoritarian groups operate under a \u201Cno talk\u201D rule, where it is considered a grave sin to acknowledge shortcomings in the hierarchy. For example, in ISKCON, the Krishna consciousness organization, they called it \u201Cblasphemy of a pure devotee\u201D to speak about anything the gurus did wrong. Meanwhile, gurus notoriously did dishonest things and involved followers in unethical behavior that would make any normal person feel shame. Gurus then use this shame to manipulate followers. While under the spell of the group, even good, honest people who join may internalize the attitudes of arrogance and denial. They may never uncover any reason to feel guilt. However, most often, former members who took part in crimes and abuses do feel guilt after they leave. Ex-members\u2019 guilt may be overly harsh, due to internalizing cult leaders\u2019 punitive and uncompassionate attitudes. In this presentation, Nori Muster will discuss her personal struggle overcoming post-cult guilt, and Lorna Goldberg and Nori will discuss reasons why former members may hold onto or deny the guilt they feel. Lorna will share self-forgiveness tools to help ex-members reframe their experiences, reduce their self-punishing attitudes, and free themselves from their groups once and for all.",

      "description": "Parent to Parent: Keeping Your Teen Safe and Prevention Before Recruitment: Where do we Begin? (Robin Boyle-Laisure and Andrea Laisure)\n\nThis talk will address various forms of harmful relationships affecting pre-teens, teenagers, and young adults. Attempts to lure minors and young adults into organizations take the form of religious or non-religious cults, with college campuses as vulnerable sites for recruitment. International human trafficking rings, have become increasingly difficult to police. Furthermore, as detailed in Rachel Lloyd\u0027s book, Girls Like Us, teenagers are often targets of commercial sexual exploitation. In addition, are incidents of one-on-one abuse between teens within romantic relationships. Previously depicted as \u0022\u0022domestic violence\u0022\u0022 among adults, there can be similar harmful dynamics between teenagers. In Part I of my talk, I would focus on how undue influence plays a role in the following: - Recruitment into cults; (many speakers will address this, so this would be short) - Recruitment into human trafficking rings; - Commercial sex industry; and - Abusive one-on-one romantic relationships. And Part II would be - how to talk to your pre-teen and teenager to prevent these relationships from forming; - warning signs for parents about abusive relationships their children may be having; - suggested ways to handle if you\u0027ve suspected a dangerous relationship; and - where to turn for help.\n\n\nPrevention Before Recruitment: Where do we Begin? \n\nAlexandra Stein \n\nIn 1952, Solomon Asch, the great social psychologist and scholar of social influence, wrote: \u201CThe greater man\u2019s ignorance of the principles of his social surroundings, the more subject is he to their control; and the greater his knowledge of their operations and of their necessary consequences, the freer he can become with regard to them.\u201D Unfortunately, there has been little progress in the 21st century on developing public education to remedy this ignorance of controlling social influence mechanisms and thereby increase resistance in the general population to recruitment to cults and extremist groups. This paper will examine why this might be so, and propose what steps can be taken to increase knowledge of social influence to strengthen this resistance. I will suggest that prevention of both cult involvement and radicalization to extremism requires teaching people, in an ideologically neutral way, specifically about totalist groups and relationships including the methods, structures and likely outcomes of such involvements. Current prevention efforts on extremism tend to be targeted at those already recruited, or at least exposed to recruitment attempts. I will suggest that we must start much earlier in the process and reinforce this education at all levels of learning. Educators and policy makers can contribute to this effort by drawing on the rich history of research in the social and psychological sciences that has accumulated over the past 70 years, along with contemporary scholarship.",

Known as the \u201CCritical Thinker at Large\u201D to nearly 15,000 YouTube subscribers, Chris has been producing video content from Denver, CO since 2014. Following his exit in 2012 from Scientology\u2019s management group, the Sea Organization, Chris cultivated the specialized communication and organizational skills he developed through various roles in Scientology\u2019s management group, the Continental Liaison Office of the Western United States. Chris was a second-generation Scientologist, brought into the group at age three by his parents in California, and began working for Scientology after completing high school. After nearly 25 years of membership, Chris left Scientology. Motivated to expose his experiences in Scientology and to educate the general public on the beliefs, policies, practices, and dangers of the group, Chris published Scientology: A to Xenu (Graphicwerks, 2014), has produced dozens of solo broadcasts, has interviewed more than 100 guests for video and his \u201CSensibly Speaking\u201D podcast, edits the interviews and promotes them through social media channels. Chris appeared on Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath (A\u0026E, 2017) in Season One, Special Episode One. Three strong influences in his post-Scientology recovery include Carl Sagan\u0027s The Demon Haunted World, James Randi, skeptic.com, and Michael Shermer, who contributed to the reshaping of his worldview and his desire to promote critical thinking and reason as a counter to undue influence and thought reform techniques. Just one of Chris\u2019s near future goals includes university studies in undue influence and anti-extremism.",

      "description": "Applying Cultural Competency to Work with Former Cult Members (Matthew Staton, MDiv Counseling)\n\nHow can we improve competence in counseling clients emerging from coercive religious backgrounds? Training and conceptual models for use with this specific population are scarce. However, research and anecdotal evidence indicate that each coercive group (broadly defined, a cult) creates its own culture, complete with a unique body of knowledge, morality, rules, literature, and terminology. This culture so shapes its adherents that second-generation adults often feel like third-culture kids when assimilating into mainstream culture after exiting the cult. A question we often encounter in our online cult-recovery groups is whether anyone can recommend a local counselor who \u201Cgets it\u201D \u2014 that is, someone who understands how deeply the cult\u0027s teachings are ingrained and can help them overcome the conditioned responses that inhibit their assimilation into society outside the cult. In this session, we will address the vacuum that exists for counselors working with this population by building on the premise that a cult is a culture. Approaching a cult as a culture provides counselors with an opportunity to apply their existing cultural competence. It also implies possible challenges for the client that might not otherwise be obvious in communicating between the cult and mainstream culture. We will use the knowledge and skills related to cultural competence in general to suggest interventions for working with those who have experienced abusive spiritual systems.",

After 23 years and a suicide attempt, she began attending college (in spite of the group\u2019s ban on higher education). After 3 years, at 43 years old, she made the decision to \u201Cdisassociate\u201D from the group, essentially ex-communicating herself. Reading Lifton\u0027s work, Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism: A Study of \u0022Brainwashing\u0022 in China and The Orwellian World of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses by Gary and Heather Botting was life-changing and put her on a path to leaving the religious group she had served for 26 years.

      "description": "Ready to Mine: Zen\u0027s Legitimating Mythology and Cultish Behavior (Stuart Lachs)\n\nZen Buddhism was the first of Eastern religions to gain wide acceptance in the West post WWII. It was accepted mostly uncritically by artists and intellectuals alike. However, beginning in the 1970\u2019s, the most prominent Zen groups in America were wracked by scandal. In spite of these repetitive scandals caused by the sexual abuse of students by their supposedly enlightened Zen masters, Zen followers and academics have refused to associate the phrase \u201Ccultish behavior\u201D to these developments. This was not the case with a range of Christian oriented groups or with Asian teachers associated with other traditions or a variety of other groups, though the Zen scandals mirrored these groups. This paper will show how Zen\u2019s legitimating story and mythic history lays the ground work for authoritarian inclined charismatic leaders - titled Zen master or rosh i- to draw his followers into a world dependent on obedience, his approval and with an ethical frame dependent on the master\u2019s self serving understanding. Though Zen presents its idealized master as being fully in the world, spontaneous, unattached, a state in which one is internally firm and free while remaining perceptually competent in the world, this has hardly been the case. This is not an abstract conjecture as the paper will mention a number of examples of Zen masters, both Eastern and Western and their followers that displayed cultish behavior, while highlighting one case in particular. It is by explaining the mythic and idealized legitimating story of Zen that helps followers make sense of their lives and earlier choices when these groups implode.

      "description": "Brainwashing - Scientific Concept or Mere Label (Dr. Benjamin Zablocki; Daniel Shaw)\n\nBrainwashing is not an easy concept to pin down. For decades it has been the most controversial of all words in the vocabulary of those who try to understand cults. Many scholars even doubt whether something called \u201Cbrainwashing\u201D should be spoken of at all, regarding it as nothing more than an insulting label used to scare people about the activities of socially unpopular groups. On the contrary, I\u2019m going to argue here tonight that \u201Cbrainwashing\u201D is not only a valid scientific concept but an essential one if we are to have any hope of understanding cults and helping people recover from cults. For a complete understanding of brainwashing we should try to understand three things: (1) what precisely brainwashing is; (2) how it works; and (3) how victims of brainwashing may be cured. Because the concept has been so misunderstood, I\u2019m going to focus here mainly on defining what brainwashing is (and equally important what it is not). If there is time, I will also discuss what we know about how it works and how its harmful effects can be undone. For those interested, more on these topics can be found on my website: benzablocki.net and on my Facebook page \u201CBenjamin Zablocki.\u201D",

      "description": "On Being Born and Raised in a High-Demand Group (Jill Mytton)\n\nPurpose: The purpose of this paper is to stimulate awareness and discussion of the impact on child development of being raised in a high-demand group. Background: Influences from parents, teachers and other sources that promote and facilitate normal childhood development are important aspects of the early years of an individual\u2019s life. Despite an increase in research in the cultic studies field there is still relatively little literature regarding the impact on a child\u2019s development of being born and raised in a cultic group. Using a specific example of such a group, namely the Exclusive Brethren, this paper will explore the experiences of and impact on children being raised in high-demand groups Key points: The paper is based on an informal thematic analysis of descriptions and stories provided by former members via email and social media. Like many similar groups, the brethren exert considerable control over their members based on their doctrine of \u201Cseparation from evil,\u201D a doctrine many consider to be taken to extremes. Now that their children only attend Brethren schools, all influence from sources outside the group that could offer alternative perspectives or narratives are absent. A number of important themes have emerged including the experience of fear and guilt, the impact of such a closed separate life on social development, the lack of life skills that inhibits them if they leave, and the common experience of dissonance as the child seeks to resolve the messages from different environments and narratives. The paper will also present findings from a quantitative study that suggests that control imposed in childhood might resonate in adult life through long term psychological sequelae Conclusions: I will argue that control imposed in childhood may affect various aspects of child development and may later impact on adult mental health.",

      "description": "First Generation Parents and Second Generation Children (Lorna Goldberg)\n\nOne of the most painful aspects of the cult experience is the undermining of the natural bond between parents who are in cults and their children. This presentation will explore the numerous techniques that cult leaders use to diminish the empathic connection between 37 parents and their children. The presenter also will discuss the powerful feelings that emerge when exiting a cult. How can those who leave the cult better deal with potentially crushing emotions? Often there is intense guilt on the part of the parents. On the other hand, there is often intense anger on the part of the second-generation adults. These emotions can be so overwhelming that former cult members can become unable to move towards a more satisfactory life. This presentation will contend that these post-cult feelings not only are the result of facing the reality of the cult experience; but, also, are a legacy of identification with the cult leader\u2019s punitive and uncompassionate attitude, which results in a harsh conscience for cult members. The presenter will provide examples from her clinical work, from the support group that she facilitates with Bill Goldberg, from workshops with first generation parents, and from ICSA workshops with second-generation former cult members. All case material will be disguised.",

Each of these studies offers well-documented evidence of antisocial acts and behaviors by cult leaders toward cult members. These published accounts, as well as previously unpublished author research, are used to develop an explanatory model of the personality organization of the cult leader. Additionally, the emergence of dependent personality disorder and other psychological sequelae among cult members is investigated. Diagnostic criteria and descriptions describing antisocial personality disorder as published in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th Edition (1994) can be employed as part of the characterization of the personality organization of the cult leader. The author has participated as a clinical team member in the diagnosis of personality disorders for juvenile offenders in the California Juvenile Probation Department and for juvenile and adult offenders in the Colorado Department of Corrections. A number of peer-reviewed studies including studies by Martin, Langone, Dole, and Wiltrout, (1992); Tobias \u0026 Lalich, (1994); West \u0026 Martin, (1999); and Kent (2004), present findings from clinical interviews of ex-cult members, which report many different antisocial acts and behaviors by cult leaders. These accounts detail numerous instances of personal mistreatment, psychological intimidation, and physical and sexual abuse of cult members by cult leaders, and offer credible evidence for the hypothesis that cult leaders may meet minimum DSM-IV criteria for diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD).",

      "description": "Listening to the still small voice: Reclaiming the self after leaving religious totalistic groups (Catherine De Boer) \n\nMemberships in social groups are central to one\u2019s self- understandings and can provide individuals with purpose, meaning, and feelings of competence and value. At times, these memberships also can test and potentially compromise one\u2019s self-understandings. In either case, disengagement from a social group has identity implications, and \u201Cfinding,\u201D \u201C(re)claiming\u201D or \u0027discovering\u201D one\u2019s self is a crucial component of a successful leaving. Using disengagement from religious totalistic groups as its focus, an argument will be made that some individuals leaving such groups not only face identity challenges typical of other socialgroup leavings, but in addition may also need to cope with the impacts of mind control, trauma, abuse, and the ego destruction they experienced in the group. These unique challenges can make achievement of identity congruence postmembership especially difficult. This presentation will highlight findings from two research studies that investigated the identity implications of disengagement from a variety of social groups. The first study (2007) investigated voluntary disengagement; a current study is investigating forced leavings. These qualitative studies using a narrative analysis had as their central aims (a) to discover whether a disengagement process exists, and if so, to discover the defining characteristics and phenomenological aspects; (b) to describe the shifts in identity that accompany the process; and (c) to consider clinical or treatment implications. This presentation will make the following claims: (a) that social group disengagement is a definable social process, and what we know about this broader phenomenon bears relevance to exiting religious totalistic groups; (b) the degree to which the associated identity-based challenges are acknowledged and addressed could determine the trajectory of the individual\u2019s life, postgroup membership; and (c) a good 33 outcome includes the achievement of identity congruence and personal agency. Specific treatment strategies and practice implications will be discussed.",

In some conversions powerful inner experiences, whether manipulated (\u0022outer generated\u0022) or not (\u0022inner generated\u0022), may cause a person to adopt new fundamental assumptions. Sometimes, a new set of experiences can cause a convert to reject the new assumptions and leave the group. The resulting disillusionment may cause serious adjustment problems.

      "description": "A Practical Approach for Law Enforcement when Dealing with Cultic Groups (Mark Roggeman)\n\nMany people who have had an experience with cults because a relative became involved have been disillusioned when they have asked law enforcement for help.  The response they usually get is that there is not much that can be done unless there is illegal activity.  The police concern is that they may be interfering with the freedom of religion.  In the present day, police departments are successfully using problem-solving models through the Community Policing model.  This model can also be implemented when a questionable group comes to the attention of local police departments.  A simple approach that officers can take is to visit a group and let them know who they are and that they are there to assist them.  They can let the group know that the department is there to protect them from those who might dislike the group or who possibly threaten to cause harm.  The connection that results could possibly cause authorities to become aware of the group\u2019s behavior, so that the authorities may be able to observe any changes that might occur relative to the group that could signal a violation of the law or even harm to the members. Law enforcement, both local and federal, most often become involved with cults after a tragedy occurs, such as suicide, involvement in financial fraud, or a case that affects children through neglect or abuse, including sexual violations.  Most of these groups probably will never do anything that attracts the attention of law enforcement.  The problem is that illegal activities that are not known to anyone outside the group do go on because of the group\u2019s isolation from the rest of society.  This kind of situation is one in which officers become effective in gathering intelligence by getting to know the group.  The result is that officers may become aware of illegal activities.  I personally had members of a group in southern Colorado reach out to me because they did not know anyone one else outside the group.  Through this connection, authorities learned that children had died, they believe because medicine was denied as a result of the group\u2019s belief that to take medicine reflected a lack of faith. An article on cultic groups in the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin of September 2000 stated accurately that the potential for violence on behalf of members of biblically driven cults is determined almost exclusively by the whims of the cult leader.  Therefore, effective intelligence and analysis of such cults requires an extensive understanding of the cult leader. To address the concern of authorities about violating the protection of individuals\u2019 freedom of religion, officers need to be concerned only with behavior that may be harmful to people both inside and outside the group.  Granted, the beliefs may be the cause of the harmful behavior, but only the behavior is the cause for concern.",

      "description": "Saved by our Son (Russell H. Bradshaw)\n\nMost of the literature on childrenin high-demand groups focuses on how distraught parents and desperate families attempt to get young people out of a cultic group. This case study, set in both Sweden and the United States tells the opposite story. An adolescent, resisting the belief system of parents and the norms of the spiritual group he was raised in, revolted and struck out on his own path. He quickly found out that the leader was in fact, not the celibate and \u201Crealized\u201D guru he claimed to be, but a deceptive and manipulative narcissist. In the midst of his own alienation and suffering, he nevertheless struggled for several years trying to convince his \u201Ctrue-believer\u201D parents of the hypocritical behavior of the leader. He also had to contend with the morally corrupt rationalizations, denials, and double-standards adopted by the inner circle of first-class disciples and other followers who tried to destroy his credibility, his career, and his relationships. Finally, amidst death threats, police complaints, and an intense \u201Cinternet war\u201D that erupted when he created a web-site, which included first-person accounts of sexual abuse by several young women, he managed to convince his parents and drag them out of the group -after almost a quarter of a century of belief and devoted service to their Guru.Central to this case study is the psychodynamic theory of Erik Erikson concerning the adolescent stage of development labeled, \u201Cidentity versus role-confusion.\u201D The specific identity crisis at this stage is the necessity of choosing an identitystatus and the use of resistance behavior to develop this identity. In Erikson\u2019s theories, adolescent revolt, turmoil, and resistance are seen as positive attributes that are necessary to the positive development of personality",

Sue will present her research around how anger and rage are different processes requiring different therapeutic responses. Gillie will outline her research on cult pseudo-personality and discuss the interaction of this with anger and rage.\n\nIt is argued that, in many cults, anger may be projected outside the group and personal anger may go underground; as a consequence, a cult member may lose the capacity to develop and protect his or her unique identity. And as a consequence of this, the cult member may become vulnerable to the persuasion and control of a thought-reform program. Alienated from one\u2018s organismic self, an individual introjects a compliant \u0027pseudo-personality\u0027 (Jenkinson, 2008) which overlays the pre-cult personality. When genuine emotional responses are forsaken, life experiences remain unprocessed and unintegrated, and cult members may operate from a state of cold rage, which often continues after leaving the group.\n\nThere will also be some discussion about Sue\u2018s ideas on \u2017adult rage\u2018. She notes there is a difference between trauma-related and nontrauma-related rage, and she identifies the negative impact of the former and the positive impact of the latter on the aims and practice of social activism.",

      "description": "Critical Thinking Skills for Former Cult Members (Doug Duncan, M.S., L.P.C.; Wendy Duncan, M.A., L.B.S.W.)\n\nFormer cult members often ask themselves, \u0022How could I have been duped so easily?\u0022 While it is certainly the case that cult recruiters make manipulative, emotional appeals, bypassing the prospective member\u0027s reason and informed consent, there are certain learned cognitive skills we can all develop that help to make us more resistant to such manipulation. What are those skills? How can I develop my reason and intellectual discernment to make it more difficult for someone to sell me a bill of goods? What can I teach my children so that they will be less subject to the dark allure of a seductive cult recruiter? Drawing from some of the basic texts in critical thinking, Doug and Wendy Duncan will show why the acquisition of critical thinking skills is helpful in a variety of contexts. Obviously, one is less likely to be drawn into a cult when one can quickly recognize a manipulative, emotional appeal, but these skills have a broad utility in many areas of modern life, such as analysis of slanted news reports, identifying deceptive sales techniques, seeing through unethical public figures, and even in facilitating informed participation in our civic institutions. Indeed, it is hard to think of any other skill set that has so many important applications as does critical thinking. Doug and Wendy will give a quick overview of critical thinking in history, identify some of the basic skills, and then have some participatory exercises that will allow for experiential learning by the workshop participants. Learning these skills cannot only help former members to keep from being re-victimized by another high-demand group, it can also facilitate their recovery process by increasing their sense of empowerment. Since the topic is so broad and cannot be exhaustively covered in the short time available for this workshop, Doug and Wendy will have handouts with a bibliography to suggest how the participants can further develop their critical thinking skills.",

This model consists of weekend workshops that are open to former members of destructive cults who have applied and been screened for their compatibility for attendance. The Colorado Model differs from other workshops in its strong emphasis on psycho-education and its use of former member facilitators who are mental health professionals. The ex-member facilitator team, equipped with the important credentials of cult recovery often instills hope for those struggling with cult trauma.\n\nThe Colorado Model is similar to the Trauma Recovery and Empowerment Model (TREM). This approach uses an educational and supportive, skill-building curriculum that allows members to understand and acknowledge the impact of abuse while focusing their energies on developing techniques for mastery and enhancing     their existing strengths for coping with their current life events (Harris \u0026 Fallot, 2002). The Colorado Model adapts this approach to unique workshops that address the needs of former cult members.",

In order to manipulate followers, the cult leader is revered and group members believe that God has specifically chosen him and given him absolute authority.  The cult leader\u2019s claim that God has imparted a unique and special revelation justifies his existence as the leader and his right to exercise control.  Members of pseudo-Christian cults are taught to accept the cult leader\u2019s authority as divinely mandated.  Any doubt or questions are quickly extinguished by the leader or the group culture that dismisses external influences that contradict the groups stated mission or vision.  Through spiritual manipulation, the leader is able to obtain control over the devotees.  The tactics of manipulation include the use of guilt, peer pressure, intimidation, ridicule, and fear.  Over time, the cult member is deluged with fears of thinking independently, making wrong decisions, losing salvation, losing his relationship with God, experiencing extreme calamity if he leaves the group, and numerous other horrors.\nA panel discussion of former members of pseudo-Christian cults will focus on the spiritually manipulative techniques employed by their former cults.
