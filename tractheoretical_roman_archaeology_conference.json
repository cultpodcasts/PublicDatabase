      "description": "Professor Sara Kitat, Chairman of the Tourist Guiding Department at the Faculty of Tourism and Hotels at Alexandria University, discusses the assimilation of the Egyptian goddess Isis with the Greek goddess Ayo, focusing on their roles as mother figures and their connection to the Nile. She also explores the relationship between Isis, Ayo, and the city of Canopus, as well as the historical and cultural significance of the connection between the two goddesses. Sara concludes by emphasising the broader, universal meaning given to Ayo and Isis as symbols of salvation and civilisation.",
