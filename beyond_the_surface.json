      "description": "This podcast episode delves into the intricate topic of deconstructing monogamy, wherein we engage in a profound exploration of diverse relationship structures. Our conversation centres on the societal norms surrounding monogamy, particularly within high-control faith contexts, and the implications these norms have on individual identity and relational dynamics. The episode not only illuminates the challenges faced by individuals questioning traditional relationship models but also highlights the potential for growth and self-discovery that arises from such explorations. Throughout, we advocate for open dialogue and the importance of understanding the values that underpin our relational choices, encouraging listeners to embrace their authentic selves.\n\nConnect with Ann - https://www.annrusso.org/\n\nYour Host \n\nYou can find out more about Sam on her website - www.anchoredcounsellingservices.com.au \n\nTo connect with Sam on Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/anchoredcounsellingservices/ \n\nWant to contact with Sam about the podcast or therapy?

Growing up in a high-control religious environment, Scott found freedom through music, filmmaking, and ultimately, the act of walking away. His documentary Witness Underground is a moving tribute to artists who, like him, broke free from religious constraints and reclaimed their voices.\n\nIn this episode, we explore the emotional cost of leaving the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, the loneliness of being labelled rebellious, and the courage it takes to choose authenticity over conformity. Scott\u2019s story is a reminder that healing often begins where creativity is born\u2014and that it\u2019s possible to find belonging outside of systems that once defined us.\n\nYou can find out more about Witness Underground here - https://www.witnessunderground.com/\n\nYour Host \n\nYou can find out more about Sam on her website - www.anchoredcounsellingservices.com.au \n\nTo connect with Sam on Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/anchoredcounsellingservices/ \n\nWant to contact with Sam about the podcast or therapy?

Chris reflects on life in a Charismatic Baptist church, where fear-based theology, emotionally intense healing practices, and teachings that framed homosexuality as broken or demonic shaped his early sense of self, contributing to years of shame, anxiety, and OCD. He speaks candidly about the painful unraveling of faith, the grief of lost time spent trying to survive within conversion ideologies, and the slow shift from denial to self-acceptance. \n\nAs the conversation unfolds, we explore the complexities of healing, redefining relationships built around a false self, and finding hope through connection with others who have walked similar paths. The episode also follows Chris\u2019s move from personal recovery into public advocacy, sharing the emotional weight of challenging conversion practices and the power of survivor-led movements.

They reflect on how leaving a high-control church reshaped their ideas of authority, discipline, and what it means to raise kids with curiosity instead of fear. Through personal stories, they share the challenges of guiding children who question everything and the beauty in watching them form their own beliefs. Together, they unpack the shift from obedience to openness, from control to connection, and the daily work of letting their kids feel the full range of being human - joy, pain, doubt, wonder, all of it. It\u2019s a heartfelt conversation about breaking cycles, choosing authenticity, and raising children who feel free to be fully themselves.\n\n\nConnect With Us\n\n  \u2022  To learn more about Liz \u0026 Jesse or The Practice Co head to their\u00A0website (https://www.thepracticeco.com/) .\n  \u2022  You can follow along over on Instagram \u2013\u00A0@thepracticeco (https://www.instagram.com/thepracticeco/) \n  \u2022  You can download The Practice Co on\u00A0Apple (https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239768002) \u00A0or\u00A0Android (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.app.thepracticeco) \n\n\n\n\n\n  \u2022  You can find out more about Sam on her website \u2013\u00A0www.anchoredcounsellingservices.com.au (https://www.anchoredcounsellingservices.com.au/) \n  \u2022  To connect with Sam on Instagram \u2013\u00A0@anchoredcounsellingservices (https://www.instagram.com/anchoredcounsellingservices/) \n  \u2022  Want to contact with Sam about the podcast or therapy?

      "description": "Jeremy shares his experience of growing up within a strict Lutheran sect, offering a candid look at how faith, identity, and his late AuDHD diagnosis intersected throughout his life. From early moments of doubt at just ten years old to the long process of deconstruction that followed, Jeremy reflects on the challenges of navigating a belief system that often discouraged questioning and individuality. The conversation explores how environments rooted in rigid doctrine can stifle self-expression and perpetuate cycles of shame, while also shedding light on the unique ways neurodivergent experiences shape one\u2019s relationship with faith and community. Jeremy reveals the courage it takes to unlearn deeply ingrained beliefs and reclaim a sense of autonomy, offering listeners a deeply human story of resilience, awareness, and healing.\n\n\nWho Is Jeremy?\n\n\nJeremy Schumacher is a therapist, educator, and coach. Jeremy specialises in couples counselling, religious trauma, and sports performance, bringing warmth, adaptability, and depth to his work.

Over time, this weight collided with her growing awareness of politics and social justice, sparking questions that clashed with her upbringing and eventually led to estrangement. Her journey captures both the grief of losing family ties and the strength found in choosing authenticity, offering hope to anyone navigating the painful, but liberating, path of self-discovery.\n\n\nWho Is Lauren? \n\n\nLauren Smallcomb is a certified Mind-Body Practitioner whose journey as a healer began at 20 when she became a registered nurse, dedicating a decade to caring for patients in the ER. She later expanded her expertise to become a birth doula and, eventually, a nutritional therapist. In 2020, after making the difficult decision to walk away from a dysfunctional family system, Lauren embarked on a transformative process of rebuilding her mind and body through brain retraining and trauma healing. \n\n\nThis journey inspired her to become a certified Mind-Body Practitioner.

      "title": "The Asian American Apostate",
      "description": "In this episode, Scott, a Japanese American, reflects on his journey of navigating faith, race, and identity within evangelical Christianity. His parents adopted the church as a path to assimilation after the trauma of their own internment during World War II, a legacy that shaped his childhood in predominantly white spaces where he often felt alienated. While evangelicalism offered belonging, it also demanded conformity, leading Scott to eventually question its contradictions and begin the hard work of deconstruction. He shares the emotional labor of disentangling belief from dogma, and how cultural trauma, racial identity, and political realities like Christian nationalism complicate that process. Scott speaks candidly about the loneliness and struggle of leaving faith, but also about the healing found in community and the freedom of embracing uncertainty. His reflections point toward a spirituality grounded not in rigid certainties but in authenticity, compassion, and the courage to hold space for mystery. Who Is Scott? Scott is a 4th generation Japanese American author, musician, and podcaster. Creator/host of Chapel Probation and co-host of The Horny Chapel, Asians in Baseball, and Let\u0027s Talk About Text with Blake Chastain. Author of Asian American Apostate: Losing Religion and Finding Myself at an Evangelical University. Composer and editor at Axis Mundi Media with Brad Onishi.

We talk about the search for belonging that can draw people into high-control spaces, the manipulation and fear that keep them there, and the emotional cost of suppressing identity for the sake of faith.\n\n\nT reflects on cultic vows, spiritual betrayal, and the resilience it took to reclaim their truth and embracing their sexuality during the pandemic and navigating today\u2019s hostile climate around trans and reproductive healthcare. Their story is one of both heartbreak and renewal, showing how healing and self-definition are possible even after deep religious harm.\n\n\nWho Is T?\n\n\nBorn in the US, T graduated from Union Theological Seminary in New York City in 1993. Once a gay feminist liberation theologian, they later spent over two decades (1997\u20132020) in a coercive Sufi Muslim group in the American Midwest, where obedience to a \u201Cliving guru\u201D became central to their life. After leaving during the Covid pandemic, T has been reclaiming their sense of self and voice.

      "description": "Janice shares her story of growing up in religion, specifically a Pentecostal family in Canada, where vibrant expressions of faith like speaking in tongues were part of daily life. Raised by parents transformed by their beliefs, she navigated the tension between familial love, purity culture, and the pull of individual identity, a journey that would eventually inspire her to write Divorcing Religion. Janice reflects on pivotal moments, from high school relationships that sparked a crisis of faith to a \u201Cback to Jesus\u201D chapter that ultimately gave way to deconstruction. We discuss the emotional toll of leaving fundamentalism, the comfort she found in new secular communities, and the healing role of open conversation, resources like Dr. Marlene Winnell\u2019s work. Through candid reflections on family boundaries, forgiveness, and self-acceptance, Janice offers a heartfelt look at religious trauma and the resilience it takes to move beyond it, leaving listeners with both hope and a sense of solidarity.\n\n\nWho Is Janice?\n\n\nJanice is a Registered Professional Counsellor. Founder of CORT (Conference on Religious Trauma) and Shameless Sexuality: Life After Purity Culture. Host of the Divorcing Religion Podcast.

She shares how fear and obedience were embedded in her early beliefs, and how that shaped her sense of self for years. As we talk through the pivotal moments that led to her deconstruction, Elise opens up about the inner conflict, grief, and eventual freedom that came with walking away from faith. We also explore how finding the right language became a powerful part of her healing, because sometimes, putting words to your experience is the first act of reclaiming it.

      "description": "In this deeply moving episode, Erica shares her story of growing up in a religious household in Canada and then moving to Australia, a childhood shaped by fear, guilt, and shame. Her reflections offer insight into the painful journey of untangling self-worth from the expectations of family and faith. We talk about what it means to deconstruct beliefs that were never truly yours, the shame that purity culture breeds, and the disconnection from one\u2019s own body and desires that can follow.\n\n\nErica\u2019s journey is also shaped by her experience of being neurodivergent, adding another layer to the complexity of surviving high-control religious environments. She opens up about body image, sexuality, and the long road to self-compassion, especially when society and religion have tied your value to your purity. And in a surprising twist, Erica\u2019s discovery about her biological origins prompts a fresh reckoning with her past.\n\n\nThis conversation is for anyone listening who\u2019s ever wrestled with identity, family, or faith. Her story is a reminder that healing is messy, layered, and worth every step.\n\n\nWho Is Erica?\n\n\nErica Webb\u00A0is a registered counsellor, somatic exercise coach and highly sensitive person. She supports other highly sensitive women to discover their sensitivity superpowers and more confidently navigate the tricky bits of being a sensitive person in an often insensitive world.\u00A0\n\n\nErica combines her training in Behavioural Science, Counselling, and various mindful movement modalities, along with her understanding of the nervous system\u2019s role in trauma, pain and high sensitivity.

But beneath the surface of religious rituals and gender expectations was a deeper struggle with mental health, body image, and the pressure to be the \u201Cgood girl.\u201D In this episode, Daisy opens up about the impact of purity culture, the silence around emotional wellbeing, and the loneliness of living in a community that misreads pain as a spiritual flaw.\nHer story explores what happens after you leave: the guilt, the shame, the slow work of finding yourself again. Daisy shares how writing, community, and coming out as bisexual became lifelines in her journey toward freedom. This conversation is a tender and honest look at what it means to untangle your identity from a faith that tried to define it for you.\nWho Is Daisy?\nDaisy lives in the Utah Valley with her husband and three kids. When she\u2019s not writing her next book, she\u2019s reading, cooking, and spending time with her family. Her love of writing has been prominent since childhood, and she\u2019s always felt a call to share her stories, as well as been encouraged to by her late grandpa. A hopeless romantic since she first saw The Phantom of the Opera at age eight, she\u2019s been writing her own romances ever since!\nShe\u2019s a former member of a high demand religion and hopes to bring light to the issues of the church in which she was raised, while also telling beautiful stories about life after leaving.\nAs a fat woman, body inclusivity is extremely important to her, so most of her FMCs, and some of her MMCs, will be fat baddies who get their HEA. She\u2019s also a member of the LGBTQ\u002B community, and it\u2019s important to her that everyone who reads her books feels safe and welcome.\nConnect With Us\nYou can find more about Daisy on her website - https://www.daisywren.com/Or you can connect over on Instagram.\nYou can find out more about Sam on her website - www.anchoredcounsellingservices.com.auTo connect with Sam on Instagram - @anchoredcounsellingservicesWant to contact with Sam about the podcast or therapy?

      "description": "Luke grew up as the youngest of five, navigating family dynamics and a complicated relationship with faith. His journey from rural Canada to a deeply evangelical college in the U.S. brought him face-to-face with teachings that clashed with his emerging queer identity. In this episode, Luke shares candid reflections on conversion therapy, the pressures of purity culture, and the emotional toll of trying to conform in high-control religious spaces.\n\n\nThrough humour, honesty, and vulnerability, Luke tells the story of finding his way back to himself. From shame and suppression to joy and self-expression, this conversation is a powerful reminder of what\u2019s possible when we stop hiding and start healing.\n\n\nWho Is Lucas?\n\n\nLucas Wilson is a SSHRC Postdoctoral Fellow at University of Toronto Mississauga and was formerly the Justice, Equity, and Transformation Postdoctoral Fellow at University of Calgary.

      "description": "This episode shares the powerful story of Grace, whose journey through religious trauma and identity is deeply intertwined with her experience of asexuality. Raised in a strict Calvinistic Baptist church, Grace was taught doctrines like total depravity and original sin, which left her believing she was fundamentally broken. These messages shaped her early understanding of self-worth, shame, and sexuality. Her story is a reminder of how difficult it can be to explore identity when your framework for understanding yourself is steeped in fear and control. Through it all, her connection to nature and a more agnostic spirituality has offered peace. Who Is Grace? Grace was born in England, moving to Aotearoa at age 13. She was homeschooled throughout her upbringing in a conservative Christian family, though she no longer identifies with the faith. These days, she resonates more with agnostic or atheist perspectives. Grace is neurodivergent and lives with anxiety and depression, and she\u2019s currently awaiting an ADHD diagnosis. She is a survivor of child sexual assault and purity culture, and speaks openly about the long-term impacts of both. Grace identifies as asexual and demisexual and is married to an incredible man. She\u2019s aesthetically attracted to both men and women (though she\u2019ll tell you women take the lead there). She\u2019s currently studying psychology and working toward a career that reflects her lived experience and deep empathy for others.

We examine the intricate layers of her upbringing, including the strictures imposed by the church that shaped her identity and relationships. Throughout, we explore the psychological ramifications of such a rigid belief system, particularly how it influences one\u0027s autonomy and self-perception. Melissa shares her evolving understanding of spirituality, ultimately gravitating towards a secular perspective while remaining open to the mysteries of existence.

Elayna opens up about growing up in a tight-knit Mormon community, where strict rules around purity and behaviour made her feel isolated and controlled. She talks honestly about the fear, guilt, and loneliness she carried as a child, and how those feelings eventually pushed her to question and leave her faith. A really eye-opening part of the conversation explores her decision to become a stripper, a bold move that she frames as reclaiming her body, power, and freedom. This shift wasn\u2019t just about a new career but about pushing back against stigma and healing from past trauma. She explains how setting boundaries and embracing consent helped her build a sense of agency she\u2019d never had before. Who is Elayna? Elayna is an ex-Mormon turned stripper! Mormonism brought her sexual shame while the sex industry brought her sexual healing. The work of Dr. Marlene Winell was pivotal in her religious recovery process.

Raised in a conservative Christian environment, Tyler opens up about the deep impact of excommunication, shame, and the pressure to conform, especially as he began to embrace his queer identity. We dive into the complex layers of faith, sexuality, and recovery, exploring how authoritarian leadership and love bombing shaped his experience. This conversation is raw, honest, and ultimately hopeful, offering a glimpse into the messy but beautiful process of healing, reclaiming identity, and finding community after spiritual harm.\n\n\nWho Is Tyler?\n\n\nA ever-curious and ever-evolving learner, Tyler Williamson is a queer bartender and life coach based in Birmingham, Alabama.

Tyler began his deconstruction process in the midst of great grief and loss, but has been finding deep healing in de- and re-constructing his life and faith. And finally getting to date boys \n\n\nYou can find him and more of his story on his Instagram @wtylerwilliamson.

Steff shares openly about their journey of self-discovery, the importance of vulnerability, the search for belonging, and the healing power of telling your story. This episode is a reminder of how crucial it is to create spaces where people can show up fully as themselves; no masks, no shame and imagine a version of faith that makes room for everyone.

Embraced by the Church at just 10 years old, her decades-long relationship with faith shaped her identity in profound ways. In this episode, Josie opens up about navigating evangelism, rigid gender roles during her college years, and the inner conflict between personal desires and religious conditioning. We also explore the church\u2019s treatment of marginalised people and the tension this created within her own family. Her story is a powerful reminder that deconstruction is not about rejection. It\u2019s about growth, agency, and learning to live with questions. Who Is Josie? Dr. Josie McSkimming is a psychotherapist, academic, author and consultant who has long explored the intersections of identity, belief, and relational dynamics. Specialising in the fallout from fundamentalist religious communities, she works with clients to make sense of fear, shame, and confusion that often linger long after departure. Josie\u2019s therapeutic style is warm, inclusive, and attuned to cultural nuances. Through research, training, and clinical practice, she assists individuals in examining old narratives, building healthier relationships, and forging more authentic understandings of faith, spirituality, and their own inner lives.

In this episode of Beyond the Surface, she shares what it was like to join the Church from a secular background, navigate strict rules and rituals through her teen years, and eventually face the slow, painful process of questioning everything. From avoiding certain rites as a \u201Cconvert\u201D to the metaphorical shelf of doubts finally breaking, AJ\u2019s story is one of deep emotional complexity. After leaving, she began to rebuild her identity\u2014embracing polyamory, autonomy, and a life beyond shame.\nWho Is AJ?\nAJ is an ex-Mormon yoga vegan hippie who lives life according to her own heart and desires.

Growing up in a conservative Baptist environment, he reflects on how deeply ingrained beliefs of exclusion shaped his views, and how he came to see the Bible\u2019s so-called \u201Cclobber passages\u201D as a message of love and acceptance. Colby discusses the challenges of reconciling his upbringing with his new affirming beliefs, emphasising the importance of staying true to oneself despite potential backlash.

Growing up in a high-control religious environment, Scott found freedom through music, filmmaking, and ultimately, the act of walking away. His documentary Witness Underground is a moving tribute to artists who, like him, broke free from religious constraints and reclaimed their voices.\n\n\nIn this episode, we explore the emotional cost of leaving the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, the loneliness of being labelled rebellious, and the courage it takes to choose authenticity over conformity.

His teen music community recorded two indie rock albums while being influenced by a religious cult. He ran camera and sound for a local news station and went to university for photography and digital media. He spent five years in Hanoi, Vietnam focused on documentary filmmaking culminating in a music-scene anthology film, Hanoi Mixtape.\n\n\nWitness Underground is Scott\u0027s first documentary. He runs the adjacent Banana Island Films YouTube channel featuring interviews with CULT ESCAPE ARTISTS demonstrating how self-expression shortens the path to healing after traumatic experiences highlighting people who have successfully navigated mind control.\n\n\nHe\u0027s volunteering with Decult related projects including a peer to peer support group in the home city of Decult, Otautahi New Zealand.\n\n\nConnect With Us\n\n  \u2022  You can find out more about Witness Underground here - https://www.witnessunderground.com/\n  \u2022  You can also connect with Scott over Instagram - @scotthoman (https://www.instagram.com/scotthoman/)  or via Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/homanscott/) \n\n\n\n\n\n  \u2022  You can find out more about Sam on her website - www.anchoredcounsellingservices.com.au (https://www.anchoredcounsellingservices.com.au/) \n  \u2022  To connect with Sam on Instagram - @anchoredcounsellingservices (https://www.instagram.com/anchoredcounsellingservices/) \n  \u2022  Want to contact with Sam about the podcast or therapy?

Raised in Spain and California by missionary parents, faith wasn\u2019t just a belief\u2014it was her family\u2019s entire identity. In this episode, she shares what it was like growing up in a world shaped by martyrdom, purity culture, and rigid gender expectations, and how these pressures left her feeling rootless and anxious.\nTogether, we unpack the emotional toll of high-control religion and the complex process of stepping away from a \u201Cgood church girl\u201D identity. From questioning her beliefs to rediscovering creativity and community, Steph\u2019s story is a powerful reflection on the courage it takes to deconstruct and rebuild a life that truly fits.\nWho Is Steph? \nSteph is a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist in California specialising in Religious Trauma. As an exvangelical themselves, they often think of how their own religious upbringing intersects with the clinical space and their clients. It has been powerful to create space where clients can feel seen and validated while exploring their unique experiences. Their deconstruction process was a pivotal time to hone their values system, rebuild community, and learn how to trust their instincts.

His story weaves through early experiences shaped by guilt and expectation, a high-pressure career in investment banking, and a life-altering moment following the events of September 11, 2001. This turning point led Larry to explore diverse spiritual traditions - both Eastern \u0026 Western, and to question the boundaries of religious dogma. The conversation delves into faith, symbolism, and the power of personal interpretation, inviting listeners to reflect on their own evolving spiritual paths.\n\n\nWho Is Larry?\n\n\nLarry Jordan spent 25 years in investment banking, assisting companies, governments, and non-profit agencies in issuing over $10 billion of municipal bonds for capital projects and cash flows.\n\n\nIn 2011, he quit his job and sold his house to spend his life in service. He drove veterans to the VA clinic, prepared 1,000 tax returns for low-income families, taught school in Africa, and volunteered for the American Red Cross.\n\n\nOver the last 20 years, he traveled around the world, read over 1,000 books about spirituality, and had some powerful experiences in several spiritual traditions, including baking in a sweat lodge, chanting to Shiva, meditating in a zendo, and whirling with the dervishes.\n\n\nHis first book, \u0022The Way: Meaningful Spirituality for a Modern World\u0022 won Silver a 2024 Nautilus Book Award.\n\n\nConnect With Us \n\n  \u2022  You can find out more about Larry \u0026 his book via his website (https://larryjordanauthor.com/) . \n  \u2022  You can also connect on Instagram (https://Instagram.com/larryjordanauth) , \u0026 Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/larryjordanauth/) \n\n  \u2022  You can find out more about Sam on her website - www.anchoredcounsellingservices.com.au (https://www.anchoredcounsellingservices.com.au/) \n  \u2022  To connect with Sam on Instagram - @anchoredcounsellingservices (https://www.instagram.com/anchoredcounsellingservices/) \n  \u2022  Want to contact with Sam about the podcast or therapy?

She reflects on the pervasive guilt and shame instilled by Catholic teachings and the ways purity culture shaped her understanding of desire and repression. As the conversation unfolds, Sara discusses her literary work, including novels written under the pen name Elodie Hart, which challenge traditional narratives by exploring sexuality (sometimes within religious contexts). Through her writing, she reclaims her story and invites readers to confront the often-taboo tensions between faith, sex and self-expression. This episode offers a thought-provoking look at the power of literature to spark dialogue, promote healing, and challenge deeply ingrained beliefs about autonomy, desire, and self-acceptance.

      "description": "In this episode of Beyond the Surface, Kit (he/they) shares their deeply personal journey of growing up in the Bible Belt and navigating the impact of religious trauma. Raised in a home influenced by Dr. James Dobson\u2019s child-rearing methods, Kit reflects on the atmosphere of fear and control that shaped their early years. They discuss how this environment, along with the pervasive Christian culture, affected their sense of identity, particularly as a queer individual. As Kit recounts their coming out process, they highlight the social rejection and isolation they faced, shedding light on the challenges of breaking away from traditional religious and societal norms. The episode concludes with Kit\u2019s journey toward self-acceptance, the importance of setting boundaries with toxic family dynamics, and the power of self-love and healing. This conversation offers a meaningful exploration of religious trauma and encourages listeners to embrace their own paths to liberation. Who Is Kit? Kit Morgan (he/they), licensed clinical social worker in New York and creator of @theliberatedporch is a leading innovator for 2SLGBTQIA\u0026#43; religious trauma informed care.

      "description": "Episode Summary Jess shares her journey from a rigid religious upbringing to a more expansive and liberating spiritual understanding, shaped by her parents\u2019 transition from Indonesian pop stars to church ministers. Growing up in a Pentecostal Charismatic environment, she struggled with purity culture, the pressure to meet impossible religious standards, and restrictive doctrines like the \u2018Dating Revelation,\u2019 which removed personal agency in relationships. As she began exploring centering prayer and reconnecting with her intuition, Jess discovered that spirituality could exist beyond the confines of the church. Her story is a powerful testament to the freedom found in self-discovery, love, and the natural world, encouraging listeners to embrace curiosity, question limiting beliefs, and seek communities that nurture authenticity. Who Is Jess? Jess is on a mission to live a more connected and intuitive life. A recovering pastor\u2019s kid, she devoted her whole life to church and ministry until her mid-30s, when she began to ask questions about her faith that had no easy answers. The long process of deconstruction that followed has put her on a pathway toward deeper connection with her own embodied truths and intuition, and a more gentle way of life for her and her children. Today she offers peer support calls for people experiencing spiritual deconstruction and other major life shifts, as well as Reiki healing and Women\u2019s Circles, all in the service of helping others connect to their own inner wisdom. Jess lives with her three brilliant kids and two quirky fur babies among the healing forests of the Dandenong Ranges, Melbourne.

She recounts a six-year relationship overshadowed by a controlling religious community, a move to Australia in search of healing, and the personal upheaval of deconstructing her faith and marriage. Embracing atheism and agnosticism, Sally-Ann illustrates the transformative power of choosing curiosity over certainty, reminding us that forging one\u2019s own identity can bring both freedom and self-discovery. Who Is Sallyann? Born into a Catholic family in Ireland, and then becoming a \u2018born again Christian\u2019 and moving to a Pentecostal church, Sallyann was serious about her faith and her commitment to God. It wasn\u2019t until she started studying Psychology and Counselling in her late 30s that she began having doubts and questioning her faith. After several years of \u2018seeking God\u2019, reading and researching, and talking to other Christians including church leaders, she found that she could no longer call herself a Christian. Sallyann is now a therapist working in Perth, Western Australia, specialising in supporting people who are questioning their faith, or who are leaving or have left a high control religion or cult.

We explore the deep complexities of healing from religious trauma and the challenges faced when leaving a high-control community, emphasising that healing is about gaining freedom from the past, not erasing it. Craig sheds light on the fear and surveillance tactics employed by these communities against those who choose to leave and the cultural adjustments required to adapt to mainstream society. Reflecting on his journey of self-discovery and the importance of personal identity, Craig\u2019s insights highlight the need for sensitivity and respect when engaging with those who\u2019ve left insular religious backgrounds.

      "description": "In a heartfelt exploration of religious trauma, Sam and Clare delve into Clare\u0027s experiences as a pastor\u0027s daughter in a high-control church. Clare reflects on the authoritarian, misogynistic dynamics of her upbringing, revealing how these shaped her identity through expectations of perfection and submission. The discussion broadens to examine religious control\u0027s impact, including conversion therapy practices and LGBTQ\u0026#43; rights. Clare\u2019s journey of breaking free, becoming a whistleblower, and advocating for others underscores her resilience, even as she navigates the challenges of familial ties. Her humour and authenticity offer hope and empower listeners to embrace healing, self-care, and reclaiming their values. Who Is Clare? Clare Heath-McIvor, formerly known as Kit Kennedy in the blogging and podcasting world, is a dedicated communications professional with specialisations in research writing, manuscript development, and non-fiction publishing. She\u2019s passionate about helping people understand their experiences within evangelicalism and high-demand groups, empowering them to navigate life beyond those frameworks. A proud mum to two spirited souls, Clare balances life as a businesswoman, advocate, and church survivor who has even taken her turn as a whistleblower. Though naps rank high on her list of passions, Clare is deeply committed to her journey through theology and faith deconstruction, which she chronicles with honesty and optimism. Her blog began as an outlet for exploring theology but evolved into a profound journey of faith deconstruction and discovery, leading her to a new way of engaging with spirituality. Today, Clare writes from a place of peace, aiming for that grounded perspective to resonate through her words. In early 2020, she launched Unchurchable, a podcast for those who find spirituality more accessible than traditional church structures. Whether due to doctrine, trauma, social justice concerns, or other factors, Unchurchable offers a space for those excluded from traditional spaces to engage meaningfully with faith. Clare\u2019s podcast journey expanded in 2023 with Survivors Discuss, co-hosted with Cait West and Shari Smith, where she dives into life after Christian patriarchy alongside two powerhouse voices in the deconstruction space. When not writing, Clare indulges her love for photography, explores Melbourne\u2019s galleries and bookshops, and occasionally tries her hand at stand-up comedy. Connect With Us!

      "description": "Can balancing faith with personal freedom bring true inner peace? In this episode, we sit down with Elise as she shares her raw journey of growing up in a Pentecostal family, where she struggled to balance genuine friendships with heavy religious expectations. Elise opens up about the emotional toll of marriage, depression, and Bible college, highlighting the idolization of overwork in Pentecostal churches and its impact on her well-being. As she deconstructs her faith, Elise reflects on how therapy and self-reflection helped her redefine her beliefs and find safe, authentic spiritual spaces.\n\n\nMore About Elise\n\n\nElise is a Trauma-Informed Counsellor and Coach based in Melbourne, Australia, who is passionate about supporting individuals recovering from Religious Trauma. For decades, she denied her own humanity, constantly pushing herself beyond her physical, emotional, and spiritual limits, unable to say \u0027no\u0027 or slow down due to a deep fear of not being enough. Depression, anxiety, chronic low self-esteem, and perfectionism were her constant companions, while religion, a significant part of her life, only seemed to fuel her self-loathing. She internalised beliefs of being inherently sinful and unworthy of love, living in fear of eternal punishment if she fell outside of God\u0027s grace. This relentless need to prove her worth to God, the church, and herself eventually pushed her to the brink.\n\n\nGradually, Elise learned to embrace her doubts, questions, pain, and anger, as well as the joy, freedom, curiosity, and self-acceptance that came with letting go. Now, she is deeply passionate about walking alongside others as they reconnect with their own humanity, which is always deserving of love, care, and gentle compassion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect With Us\n\n  \u2022  You can find out more about Elise via her website - https://www.eliseheerde.com \n  \u2022  Or you can connect over on Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/eliseheerde/)  or Facebook  (https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=elise%20heerde%20-%20counsellor%20coach\u0026__epa__=SEARCH_BOX\u0026__eps__=comet.home\u0026__hcr__=eyJpZCI6IjEwMDA3NjU4Mjk4NjAzMCIsInNvdXJjZSI6IlRZUEVBSEVBRF9VU0VSX01BUktFUiJ9) \n\n\n\n\n\n  \u2022  To connect with Sam on Instagram - @anchoredcounsellingservices (https://www.instagram.com/anchoredcounsellingservices/) \n  \u2022  Want to contact with Sam about the podcast or therapy?

Join us for a gripping episode of Beyond the Surface as we sit down with Ruth from snowy Connecticut, who bravely recounts her harrowing experiences growing up in a militant Catholic institution. Separated from her parents and subjected to the institution\u0027s extreme religious and political ideologies, Ruth\u0027s story is a powerful testament to the devastating effects of institutionalised abuse and religious indoctrination.
