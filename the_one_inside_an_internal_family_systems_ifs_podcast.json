      "description": "Britt Frank escaped a cult, rebuilt her life after addiction, and is one of the most grounded, funny, and inspiring IFS speakers and educators around.\n In this week\u2019s episode, we talk about her new book Align Your Mind, and how parts work helped her move from chaos to clarity.\n We get into all of it...motivation, procrastination, inner critics, cults, menopause, and what alignment looks like beyond the buzzwords.\n Britt shares how she uses parts language in her own life, how she reframes procrastination as protection, and why your most extreme parts might actually be your best coaches.\n She also opens up about what it\u2019s like to come out of systems of control and begin to trust your own experience again. As Britt says, \u201COur parts don\u2019t want us to feel better.
