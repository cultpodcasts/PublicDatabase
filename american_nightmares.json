      "description": "Welcome to a new season of American Nightmares! A pristine neighborhood in Ogden, Utah hides something rotten. When a couple moves into Northwood subdivision in 1981, they\u2019re welcomed with free landscaping, shared supplies, and a sense of family - until the community\u2019s leader, Arvin Shreeve, reveals a secret doctrine of polygamy and sexual manipulation. Nearly a decade later, on July 9, 1991, a woman walks into the Weber County Attorney\u2019s Office and confesses to detective Mike King that she was part of the Zion Society, a cult she says was abusing children.

      "description": "NEW True Crime Series from Gamut Podcast Network. Gardens of Evil: Inside the Zion Society Cult begins February 3rd. It was just another quiet neighborhood in small town America. At least, that\u0027s how it looked. But the immaculately groomed yards, trimmed hedges, and brightly colored flower gardens hid an insidious secret. More than a hundred residents were members of a cult called The Zion Society. Hiding in plain sight, they hoarded guns and ammunition. They created, sold, and modeled sexy lingerie. They took children away from parents and groomed them for sexual abuse. Their beliefs were centered around satisfying the perverted desires of one man - their leader: an unassuming, soft-spoken landscaper. Neighbors knew something was amiss, but it wasn\u0027t until a brave young woman broke away from the secretive group and confessed to authorities that everything began to unravel for this dangerous cult. This is the story of that unraveling told by the people who lived it.
