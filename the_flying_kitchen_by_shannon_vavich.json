      "description": "June 11, 2025 - Not Today, Satan!  In today\u2019s broadcast, we dive into three unfolding stories that lay bare the growing influence of far-right Catholic extremism in American politics. We begin with Senator Chuck Grassley\u2019s effort to spin a legitimate FBI investigation into a narrative of false persecution. Then, we turn to a surprising act of integrity from Archbishop Jos\u00E9 Gomez, who breaks ranks with the MAGA-aligned hierarchy. And finally, we look ahead to this Saturday\u2019s extraordinary contrast: Trump\u2019s militarized birthday parade in D.C. versus Pope Leo XIV\u2019s message of peace, livestreamed from Rome to a crowd in his hometown of Chicago.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about policy differences. It\u2019s a full-scale confrontation between authoritarian ambition and democratic conscience. Between spiritual manipulation and moral clarity.\n\nFollow me on all my social media channels.

Viewer participation via thoughtful comments are encouraged. \n\nToday we will examine Pope Leo\u0027s first 10 days in the papacy, what he\u0027s said about the world, and if he will stand with the peoples of the world against hate, greed and authoritarian regimes. \n\nWe will also examine the following topics: \n\nNuances surrounding the balance of power in the world today - white supremacy, erasure, genocide. \n\nPope Leo\u2019s statements on marriage, sexuality and reproductive rights.\n\nHistorical precedents of stuff pope\u2019s have said. \n\nWhy the crux of all of this is Vatican II\n\nAnd attempt to answer the questions: \n\nShould we remain hopeful that Pope Leo will move the needle towards human rights?\n\nCan we make an assessment right now as to the intent of the right side of SCOTUS regarding a theocracy? \n\nIs the evolution of The Catholic Church in response to the voice and expectations of the people?  Or is the voice and expectation of the people in response to the evolution of the Catholic Church?\n\nIs Project 2025 Heretical? \n\nsources links:  \nhttps://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/may/documents/20250516-corpo-diplomatico.html\n\nhttps://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2025-05/pope-to-diplomatic-corps-build-peace-with-justice-truth-hope.html\n\nPope Gregory XVI \u2013 Mirari Vos (1832)\n \u2022 Full text: https://www.papalencyclicals.net/greg16/g16mirar.htm\n Pope Pius IX \u2013 Quanta Cura and Syllabus of Errors (1864)\n \u2022 Quanta Cura: https://www.papalencyclicals.net/pius09/p9quanta.htm\n \u2022 Syllabus of Errors: https://www.papalencyclicals.net/pius09/p9syll.htm  \n Pope Leo XIII \u2013 Rerum Novarum (1891)\n \u2022 Full text: https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum.html\n Pope Benedict XIV \u2013 Allatae Sunt (1755)\n \u2022 Full text: https://www.papalencyclicals.net/ben14/b14allat.htm \n ope Pius XI \u2013 Casti Connubii (1930)\n \u2022 Full text: https://www.vatican.va/content/pius-xi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19301231_casti-connubii.html\n Pope Boniface VIII \u2013 Unam Sanctam (1302)\n \u2022 Full text: https://www.papalencyclicals.net/bon08/b8unam.htm\n\n\nhttps://www.catholic.com/tract/scripture-and-tradition\n\nhttps://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/court-role-and-structure\n\nhttps://www.history.com/topics/united-states-constitution/freedom-of-religion\n\nhttps://www.usccb.org/beliefs-and-teachings/what-we-believe/morality\n\nhttps://us.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/30388_1.pdf\n\nhttps://www.justice.gov/crt/law-enforcement-misconduct\n\nhttps://www.franciscanmedia.org/franciscan-spirit-blog/understanding-the-sacrament-of-marriage\n\nhttps://www.justia.com/lgbtq/family-law-divorce/same-sex-divorce\n\nhttps://www.usccb.org/beliefs-and-teachings/what-we-believe/catholic-social-teaching/seven-themes-of-catholic-social-teaching\n\n\nhttps://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/index.htm\n\nhttps://www.usccb.org/beliefs-and-teachings/what-we-believe/vatican-ii\n\nhttps://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651207_dignitatis-humanae_en.html\n\nhttps://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651028_nostra-aetate_en.html\n\nhttps://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html\n\nhttps://www.catholic.com/encyclopedia/second-vatican-council\n\n\nhttps://www.interfaithalliance.org/post/project-2025-threatens-religious-freedom\n\nhttps://bjconline.org/what-does-project-2025-say-about-religious-liberty-071924\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/21/project-2025-trump-conservatives-christian-nationalism\n\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/17/project-2025-heritage-foundation-trump-00122399\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/06/project-2025-trump-anti-lgbtq-rights\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_2025",

      "description": "While some speculate due to a 2019 Mass he presided over honoring Opus Dei\u2019s founder, the context tells a different story. At the time, Leo was the bishop of Chiclayo, Peru\u2014a region with significant Opus Dei influence. Participating in local religious events was part of his episcopal duties, not an endorsement.\n\nMoreover, Pope Leo has a history of confronting abuse within the Church. He played a pivotal role in addressing misconduct in the Sodalitium Christianae Vitae, meeting with survivors and supporting reforms.\n\nThe narrative suggesting his allegiance to Opus Dei seems to stem from critics like Austin Ruse, an Opus Dei member, who circulated the photo to cast doubt. However, this appears more as an attempt to undermine than evidence of secret sympathies.\n\nFor a deeper dive into this topic, check out Gareth Gore\u2019s insightful article on his substack entitled \u201CThe New Pope and Opus Dei\u201D. \nhttps://open.substack.com/pub/garethgore/p/the-new-pope-and-opus-dei?r=u71n9\u0026utm_medium=ios",

Not all Catholics are fascists, in fact, most just want to practice their faith in peace and are not interested in forcing anyone into their beliefs.  However, the fascist far right Catholics have infected our entire culture with their nazi beliefs and hard line Catholicism that ALL PEOPLE should think and believe like them.  This has grave implications on Catholicism worldwide and is causing many Catholics to leave a faith they really cherish because they cannot stand the hatred we are experiencing now.

      "title": "Why Do MAGA Catholics HATE Pope Francis So Much???",
      "description": "In this episode, Shannon Vavich engages with Mark Shea to explore the complex relationship between MAGA Catholics and Pope Francis. They discuss the historical context of the pro-life movement, the concept of heresy within Catholicism, and the implications of nationalism and tribalism in faith. The conversation delves into how political agendas have shaped Catholic beliefs and practices, particularly regarding abortion and social justice. Shea emphasizes the need for a holistic understanding of Catholic teaching that transcends partisan divides, advocating for a faith that prioritizes the dignity of all human life. In this conversation, Shannon Vavich and Mark Shea explore the complexities of contemporary Christianity, particularly in relation to the MAGA movement, the pro-life stance, and the broader implications of legalism and cruelty in society. They discuss the absurdity of imposing law as a means of salvation, the mystery of evil, and the dangers of a culture that promotes scarcity and fear.
