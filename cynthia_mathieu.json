      "description": "In this episode, I examine how organizational culture influences who becomes attracted to, hired, and promoted within a company\u2014and why certain environments tend to attract individuals with dark personality traits like narcissism and psychopathy. \n\n\nI highlight the key organizational factors that draw these individuals and explain why \u201Cfake safe cultures\u201D\u2014companies that promote well-being but fail to follow through\u2014can be even more harmful than openly toxic workplaces. I also discuss ways organizations can minimize the risk of attracting dark personalities by fostering genuine cultures of safety, empathy, and accountability, led by dedicated leadership.\n \n\nThis is a public episode.
