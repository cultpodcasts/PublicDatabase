      "description": "The 70\u0027s were a crazy time to be alive. Between the war in Vietnam, dozens of political assassinations, and hundreds, if not thousands, of domestic bombings, it seemed as though you couldn\u0027t go a day without some new form of armed, radical action. However, the most famous came when, in 1974, Patty Hearst, who was raised in ultra-rich high society, was kidnapped by members of the Symbionese Liberation Army. The country watched as she sent messages to her family, and police instigated a massive manhunt. However, no one expected that Patty herself would rob a bank in Northern California alongside her kidnappers, and those images would go on to live in infamy. What followed was years of bombings, shootouts, and brainwashing. Still, no one knows the answer to what actually happened to Patty Hearst?\n\nIntro 0:00\nThe Hearst Empire 4:40\nPatty\u0027s Birth into Privilege 9:26\nBerkley, the Home of a Revolution 10:57\nBirth of the SLA 14:32\nTargeting Marcus Foster 22:20\nThe Kidnapping of Patty Hearst 28:33\nRadicalization 35:28\nRobbing Hibernia Bank 39:30\nA History of Shootouts 46:14\nThe Biggest Shootout in LA History 48:36\nThe Second Robbery, a Disaster 1:01:13\nPatty\u0027s Arrest and Trial 1:05:41\nFreedom...

      "description": "For many in the West, Yoga\u2019s ancient roots have been taken and twisted by scam artists, woo-girl bosses, and capitalist marketers using spiritual liberation as a selling point. Perhaps none have been more successful in this line of work than Katie Griggs. After celebrity endorsements from Alicia Keys, Kate Hudson, and Russell Brand skyrocketed her to fame, it was revealed that Katie was engaged in activities not exactly associated with light and love: scamming customers, verbally abusing staff, and spreading far-right conspiracy theories. So, what\u2019s the truth about Katie Griggs? An earnest guru who just wanted to spread teachings as a devoted disciple?

Ophelia was killed in the exchange, and Milo was quickly rushed to hospital and survived. After Law Enforcement searched their vehicle, they found cell phones wrapped in tin foil, riot gear, hollow-point ammunition, and a pistol registered to Michelle Zajko, whose parents were murdered in an unsolved double homicide on New Year\u0027s Eve, 2022. More than that, they found that Milo had filed a marriage license with a man in Washington named Audere (Aw-Dare), who, only days later, would be charged with the murder of Curtis Lind, a landlord in Vallejo. Curtis himself had been stabbed by a samurai sword in 2022 by his tenants, Emma Borhanian, Somnulence Logencia, and Suri Dao. At the center of all of these murders was a mysterious figure known as Ziz, a programmer in her 30s who had come out of Silicon Valley\u2019s Rationalist community.

      "description": "Many people have described social media as a cult. From following every word of an influencer to seeking the fame and fortune it can promise young people, the comparison is sometimes fair. However, in Southern California, an actual TikTok cult cuts members off from their families, gives the leader control of their finances, and forces them to live on cult-run properties, all in exchange for millions of follows and brand deals. The new Netflix documentary Dancing for the Devil not only explored the cult talent agency but exposed how Pastor Robert Shinn had been using those same tactics in his insulated Shekinah Church for nearly 30 years.",

      "description": "The Troubled Teen Industry has existed in the background for most of our lives. Whether you went to a camp, knew a friend who disappeared and attended for a while, or saw kids on Dr. Phil carted away, the troubled teen industry has cemented itself in broader American society. But in recent years, celebrity participants and other survivors have spoken out against the industry, alleging abuse, kidnapping, and even murder. However, with anywhere between 120,000-200,000 children in programs at any given time, these camps and centers can sweep everything under the rug. Utilizing cult tactics of brainwashing, false marketing, and attack therapy, the industry has garnered extreme supporters at the highest levels of government. What\u2019s truly behind this multi-billion dollar industry? Are these places good for changing a child\u2019s life, or are they trauma factories for the most vulnerable kids in our country today?",

      "description": "On December 13th, 1973, French Journalist Claude Vorilhon claimed to have met extraterrestrials named Elohim while walking along the Puy Lassolas mountain. The Elohim took him on his craft for 6 consecutive days and told him the truth about humanity: that there is no god, the Elohim created humankind in their image, and they wanted Claude to build an embassy for them when they arrived. He attracted a small following of sci-fi fans interested in joining his budding religious movement. Then, on October 7th 1975, the Elohim took him to their planet where they revealed that humanity was in the age of Apocalypse, that all previous prophets were alive through cloning on their planet, and that not only was Claude the brother of Jesus, but that he was the Messiah and was given a new name: Rael. What followed was nearly 40 years of growth, legal issues, jumping countries, and international hoaxes that kept the Raelian movement in the limelight. But is there something to Rael\u2019s claims about humanity? Does he even believe it, or is he scamming thousands of people into believing he is the last prophet? Support our Sponsors!
