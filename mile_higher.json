      "description": "On January 20th, 2025, Border Patrol Agent David Maland was shot and killed while in a standoff with Milo Youngblut and Ophelia Baukholt. Ophelia was killed in the exchange, and Milo was quickly rushed to hospital and survived. After Law Enforcement searched their vehicle, they found cell phones wrapped in tin foil, riot gear, hollow-point ammunition, and a pistol registered to Michelle Zajko, whose parents were murdered in an unsolved double homicide on New Year\u0027s Eve, 2022. More than that, they found that Milo had filed a marriage license with a man in Washington named Audere (Aw-Dare), who, only days later, would be charged with the murder of Curtis Lind, a landlord in Vallejo. Curtis himself had been stabbed by a samurai sword in 2022 by his tenants, Emma Borhanian, Somnulence Logencia, and Suri Dao. At the center of all of these murders was a mysterious figure known as Ziz, a programmer in her 30s who had come out of Silicon Valley\u2019s Rationalist community. What followed were strange blog posts, info hazards, suicides, faked deaths, and murder.\n\nIntro: 0:00\nThe Many \u0022isms\u0022 of Silicon Valley 7:53\nThe Horror of Roko\u0027s Basilisk 15:20\nWho Is Jack Lasota? 20:04\nZiz Discovers Rationalism 24:46\nAspiring to be a Sith Lord 33:32\nMeeting Gwen Danielson 38:34\nThe Beginning of a Cult 49:33\nWhat is Unihemispheric Sleep? 52:10\nLaunching the Rationalist Fleet 57:22\nMeeting Curtis Lind 1:03:07\nZiz Recruits Emma, Michelle and Somni 1:04:39\nThe Camp Meeker CFAR Protest 1:09:28\nUnhinged Behavior \u0026 a Lot of Star Wars 1:15:57\nCurtis Lind Falls Out with the Zizians 1:24:52\nA History of Being Uncooperative 1:33:19\nThe Zajko Murders 1:36:23\nTerrifying Ends for Curtis Lind \u0026 David Maland 1:41:04\nA Completely Wild Twist 1:45:52\nWho Can Explain the Zizian Cult? 1:49:35\nFinal Thoughts \u0026 Outro 1:56:38\n\nHigher Hope Foundation: https://higherhope.org\nMile Higher Merch: milehigher.shop\n\nCheck out our other podcasts!\nThe Sesh https://bit.ly/3Mtoz4X\nLights Out https://bit.ly/3n3Gaoe\nPlanet Sleep https://linktr.ee/planetsleep\n\nJoin our official FB group! https://bit.ly/3kQbAxg\nJoin our Discord community, it\u2019s free! https://discord.gg/hZ356G9\n\nMHP YouTube: http://bit.ly/2qaDWGf\nAre You Subscribed On Apple Podcast \u0026 Spotify?!\nSupport MHP by leaving a rating or review on Apple Podcast :) https://apple.co/2H4kh58\nMHP Topic Request Form: https://forms.gle/gUeTEzL9QEh4Hqz88\n\nYou can follow us on all the things: @milehigherpod\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/milehigherpod\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@MileHigher\n\nHosts:\nKendall: @kendallraeonyt\nIG: http://instagram.com/kendallraeonyt\nYT: https://www.youtube.com/c/kendallsplace\n\nJosh: @milehigherjosh\nIG: http://www.instagram.com/milehigherjosh\n\nProducers:\nJanelle: @janelle_fields_\nIG: https://www.instagram.com/janelle_fields_/\n\nIan: @ifarme\nIG: https://www.instagram.com/ifarme/\n\nTom: @tomfoolery_photo\nIG:   / tomfoolery_photo  \n\nPodcast sponsor inquires: adops@audioboom.com\n\n\u2709 Send Us Mail \u0026 Fan Art \u2709\nKendall Rae \u0026 Josh Thomas \n8547 E Arapahoe Rd Ste J # 233\nGreenwood Village, CO 80112\n\nMusic By: Mile Higher Boys\nYT: https://bit.ly/2Q7N5QO\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/0F4ik...\n\nSources: https://pastebin.com/LcjPxVTR\n\nThe creator hosts a documentary series for educational purposes (EDSA).

      "description": "Many people have described social media as a cult. From following every word of an influencer to seeking the fame and fortune it can promise young people, the comparison is sometimes fair. However, in Southern California, an actual TikTok cult cuts members off from their families, gives the leader control of their finances, and forces them to live on cult-run properties, all in exchange for millions of follows and brand deals. The new Netflix documentary Dancing for the Devil not only explored the cult talent agency but exposed how Pastor Robert Shinn had been using those same tactics in his insulated Shekinah Church for nearly 30 years.",

Whether you went to a camp, knew a friend who disappeared and attended for a while, or saw kids on Dr. Phil carted away, the troubled teen industry has cemented itself in broader American society. But in recent years, celebrity participants and other survivors have spoken out against the industry, alleging abuse, kidnapping, and even murder. However, with anywhere between 120,000-200,000 children in programs at any given time, these camps and centers can sweep everything under the rug. Utilizing cult tactics of brainwashing, false marketing, and attack therapy, the industry has garnered extreme supporters at the highest levels of government. What\u2019s truly behind this multi-billion dollar industry? Are these places good for changing a child\u2019s life, or are they trauma factories for the most vulnerable kids in our country today?",

      "description": "On December 13th, 1973, French Journalist Claude Vorilhon claimed to have met extraterrestrials named Elohim while walking along the Puy Lassolas mountain. The Elohim took him on his craft for 6 consecutive days and told him the truth about humanity: that there is no god, the Elohim created humankind in their image, and they wanted Claude to build an embassy for them when they arrived. He attracted a small following of sci-fi fans interested in joining his budding religious movement. Then, on October 7th 1975, the Elohim took him to their planet where they revealed that humanity was in the age of Apocalypse, that all previous prophets were alive through cloning on their planet, and that not only was Claude the brother of Jesus, but that he was the Messiah and was given a new name: Rael. What followed was nearly 40 years of growth, legal issues, jumping countries, and international hoaxes that kept the Raelian movement in the limelight. But is there something to Rael\u2019s claims about humanity? Does he even believe it, or is he scamming thousands of people into believing he is the last prophet? Support our Sponsors!
