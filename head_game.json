      "description": "Growing up in a strict religious household and sheltered from the outside world, Claire McAuliffe found herself coerced into marriage at the age of 18. When her husband moved Claire and their growing family to a compound belonging to a known doomsday cult, she slowly began to question the absurd teachings and questionable actions of cult leaders and members. As her questions grew, Claire found herself and her children kicked out of the family home. In this episode, Claire reveals why she and her kids were actually happy when the sheriff knocked on her door with an eviction notice, and how she endured decades under strict religious lifestyles.
