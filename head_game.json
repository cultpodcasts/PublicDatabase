      "description": "In this episode, Ant is joined by Carli McConkey. Carli was just 21 years old when she attended a wellness festival in Sydney one Sunday afternoon. She met with a psychic, hoping to gain some clarity and direction. But that encounter ended up altering the course of her life for 13 years. Carli shares her story of losing her identity, freedom and family. She also opens up about the realisation that she needed to escape, and how she fought against mind control techniques in order to do so.
