      "title": "Why do people join cults?",
      "description": "Most of us think we\u2019re too smart, stable and strong-willed to join a religious cult, or to cut ourselves off from our families to join a group devoted to a charismatic leader. But clearly somebody\u2019s joining them. So why do people willingly give up their free will and independence to join cults? Do they realise what they\u2019re getting themselves into? And how do they get out? Emma Kennedy is joined by world-leading cult deprogrammer Rick Alan Ross and NXIVM cult survivor Sarah Edmondson to explore the strange allure of the cult mindset.
