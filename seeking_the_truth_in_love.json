      "description": "In early 2009, the Christian Research Journal performed a complete 180 degree turn from their previous position on the Lord\u0027s recovery movement of Witness Lee. This journal mainly responded to an open letter signed by top Christian Scholars like James White of @AominOrg which called on the recovery to disavow some of Witness Lee\u0027s teachings. While CRI\u0027s journal was a celebration for most members of the recovery, for me it was the first time I was confronted with the cult controversy. While I don\u0027t think the Lord\u0027s recovery falls perfectly into the definition of a cult, there are certain aspects of the group\u0027s theology that should be cause for concern if you had never heard of them before. \n\nLinks:\nChristian Research Journal: \u0022We Were Wrong\u0022 -  https://www.equip.org/christian-research-journal/we-were-wrong-2/ \nOpen-Letter (From Christian Leader to the Lord\u0027s recovery) - http://www.open-letter.org/\nAn-Open-Letter (From the Lord\u0027s recovery to Christian Leaders) - https://an-open-letter.org/en/\nESV/KJV Verses pulled from - https://www.biblegateway.com/\nRecovery Version Verses pulled from - https://www.recoveryversion.bible/",
