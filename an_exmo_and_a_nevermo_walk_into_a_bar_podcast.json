Mormonism requires baptism for entrance into the Celestial Kingdom where only the most righteous can dwell. Since the early leaders of the Mormon church were anything BUT righteous, the Two NoMos use their self-proclaimed power to unbaptize Joseph Smith and Brigham Young.",

They are prohibited from ever being the Prophet, a part of the Quorum, a Bishop, or even holding the Priesthood in their own homes. They can oversee the Women\u0027s Auxiliary and the Children\u0027s Ward, but even then, they must check in with male leaders about any decisions, and they are not permitted to make decisions on their own. In this episode, \u0022Keep Sweet, Pray and... NO WAY!\u0022, Kate and Erika examine the second-class status of women in the Mormon church, and the ramifications of that for members.",
